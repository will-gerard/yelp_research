I don't live close to a Trader Joe's, so any time I get near one I have to go in and look around.  They also have a few items I can't find anywhere else, such as their garlic olive oil that is very reasonably priced, and their Simply Almonds, Cashews, and Mango Trek Mix.  Love that stuff.  South Chandler/Ocotillo/Fulton Ranch really needs a TJ's.  This one was similar to all the others, but the aisles seemed to be a little bit wider, which was nice.  Always fun to shop at Trader Joe's.

I had limited time the evening I was in this shop, but oh my.....I could spend so much money in here.  They did have some sale racks out front and some paperback sections, but this is really a bookstore to help a reader grow their library of quality, and maybe hard to find, hardcover editions.  I found an autographed Peter Matthiessen, and a collection of Wallace Stegner short stories that I had never seen before. Maybe the next time I get a bonus I'll blow part of it here.

I should explain I don't like sushi.  I have tried to like sushi.  I dated a guy many years ago who was really into sushi and he would take me to the best Omaha has to offer and show me how to use the chopsticks and mix the wasabi, the whole 9 yards.  I gave it the good ol' college try, and I just can't do it.  My stomach rolls over after a couple of pieces.  Well, I think that, combined with the fact that when he purchased his new 7 Series, I didn't writhe all over it like Tawny Kitaen,  made me less appealing.  Such is life.  Now I'm married to a man who doesn't like sushi either.    What was I saying?  Oh yeah!  We had a great lunch at RA between movies.  We each had the shrimp tempura bento box, which came with 4 shrimps, a spring roll, a potsticker, a salad, miso soup, and some fluffy white rice for $8.95.  Everything was delicious.  We also tried their seaweed salad which was nice and fresh.  The service  was great too.   We  had a few of their cocktails which if memory serves, were very tasty, but we got a little loaded and then went to see Gravity in 3D, so my memory is a little hazy.   It was one of THOSE afternoons.    I thought the lunch was definitely a great deal and would go back for that anytime.

Hmm.  Just a typical B & N, but where I get annoyed is with the cashier trying to guilt me into buying their membership.  Years ago I did the math on this thing and by paying $25/year to get a 10% discount you'd have to spend $250/year to break even.  I don't spend $250/year at B & N.  Now, I think they've made some changes where you can get more of a discount than that on the 2nd Tuesday in August of a leap year or something.    However, I'm more of an indie or used bookstore or library kinda gal.  But, I really overall have nothing against B & N.  Once in awhile I'll stop in and raid the newsstand, which always has a good selection of materials for me to read when I'm procrastinating doing something else.  So on Monday I find my way to the cashier with my random stack of reading materials and the cashier asks me twice if I want their membership.  Both times I politely said, "No, that's ok".  Then she says, looking at me sideways, "You know, SOME people add up how much they spend every year here and are SHOCKED and DISAPPOINTED when they figure out how they could have benefited from the discount."    tick tick tick  You know what.....  That passive aggressive B.S. really turned me off.  I'll get my magazines elsewhere.

I am officially on great pizza overload in this town.  Now that we've tried Nello's, it will be really hard to choose where to go the next time we're craving pizza (which is like every other day!).    Yesterday we decided to try somewhere we'd never been and Nello's was the place.  We walked in and sat at the bar and right away were greeted by Joshua who took great care of us.  He was fun to talk to as well.  We started with a 1/2 doz. of the BBQ wings and those were nicely done and I think I managed to grab 2 before Mr. M scarfed them down like they owed him money.  They don't fry them, they bake them, which I can appreciate.  The less grease in my life the better.  I ordered the 7" Pizza Bianca which was just four cheeses, but "just" four cheeses doesn't give this pizza credit.  The flavors were amazing!  This might be my new favorite pizza.  And I loved the crust.  Golden and buttery, chewy on the inside.  Perfect.  My husband ordered the 10" Numero Uno, thin crust, which is sausage and mushroom.   This is our favorite pizza combo and it was great as well.  Chewy cheese and fresh, flavorful toppings.  It really doesn't get much better.  The cold beers were reasonable too.  I had a pint of Four Peaks peach ale, and Mr. M had 2 pints of the Franziskaner Hefe Weiss.  That took us right back to Germany.  Each beer was $4.50.  What a deal!    All in we spent $36.36 before tip.  I can't wait to go back!

5-star everything.  The bacon.  The home fries.  The carrot cake muffin. (That muffin is more like 10 stars)  The eggs.  The crepes.  The coffee.  The service.  Ty was great.  He was friendly and took good care of us.  Each time he stopped by to check on us, he even spirited away the empty hazelnut creamer containers I leave all over the table.    And you can't beat the prices.  Mr. M's two-egg breakfast was $7.79 and my Euro crepe breakfast was $7.49.  The muffin was $3.25 and worth every penny.  This was our first time at this Crackers & Co, but it won't be the last.  Perfect all around.

One weekend afternoon I looked at Mr. M and said, "Hey!  Who needs to clean the house, get caught up on bills, wash the cars, and eat leftovers at home?  Let's go drive around aimlessly."  He's such a good sport and always ready to head out on one of my escapades, so we took off towards Casa Grande.  There are moments I fantasize about getting out of the city and finding a more rural abode.  Those moments usually pass when I start looking at concerts and baseball games.  But still, wouldn't it be nice to have no neighbors, a couple of horses in the backyard, and 4 or 5 big dogs?  I think so.    Someone had told me about some acreages out on the northwest side of C.G. so that's kind of where we were headed.  The drive wasn't very productive on the house-hunting side, but we did end up at Dell's for lunch.  I wasn't too sure about it because from the outside it looks kind of suspect, but inside, it's a cool little sports bar.  Lots of TVs on the walls, and right away the server said he would change any channel to whatever we wanted.  If the Cardinals aren't playing baseball we're pretty apathetic.  I think we ended up watching drag racing or something, which always makes me want to drive irresponsibly.  And run out and buy a Camaro.    We had their honey BBQ wings, which were very good, and the medium Chad's special pizza which basically has all the meats on it.  I have pictures somewhere and will get them uploaded when I find them.  Overall we really enjoyed our lunch.  Our server, JWF on the receipt, was great, and the food was very good.  The pizza is a thin crust style and baked golden brown on the bottom with lots of toppings and chewy cheese.     With 1 pint of Amber Bock $2.77, 2 pints of Kiltlifter $7.38, wings $7.60, and the pizza $13.45, lunch was $33.85 after tax, before tip.  Really enjoyed the cold beers and the food and if we're in the area we'll definitely make another visit.

The Biscuits on Dobson was just way too crowded and annoying the other day, so we swung in here for a breakfast burrito.  Not our usual location, but the great quality of the bacon breakfast burrito was the same as we are used to.  Those things are addictive!  They were very busy and had two registers going with two friendly employees.  As the bumper stickers say, "I heart Los Favs!"

This is a favorite of ours when we don't want to spend a lot of money but still go out and have a nice time.  The employees at Floridino's are so friendly and welcoming, you'll feel part of the family immediately.  Just as an example of how affordable this place is, the last time we were there we had a half order (6) original pizza muffins, 2 bottles of Stella cider, 1 Sun Spot draft, and one 12" pizza with sausage and mushrooms.  Total before tax and tip was $23.25.  Can't beat it.  I can see why they've been around as long as they have, and get as busy as they do.  Good food & drinks and always great service.

I've really scored lately with some places I've tried for the first time.  I had some great takeout over the weekend from Mucho Taco.  I ordered a carnitas taco, the Chimi de Asada, and a churro.    I was a little nervous as I walked in because I've heard this place is pretty authentic and the only Spanish I know is from watching Sesame Street.  But the young woman working at the front counter smiled and greeted me right away, which put me completely at ease.    After I placed my order I had time to look around and this is really a cute place.  Very clean, and I like the décor on the walls and the painted tiles.  It's small, but really has a nice atmosphere.  My food was ready in about 10 minutes and as I drove home the first thing I noticed was how good it smelled.  Oh my...the whole car smelled like carne asada and rich, seasoned enchilada sauce.  (They serve their chimis enchilada-style).    While I was unpacking it, one nice little touch I noticed was that someone stuck a tortilla chip between the guac and the sour cream just to keep them apart for transport.  It may end up a rich gooey mess on my plate, but it's not going to start out that way.  That made the presentation very nice when I opened the container.  The carnitas taco was small, street taco style and had a very good flavor, but the meat was slightly dry.  I added a few chopped tomatoes and a little guac and it was perfect.  I would definitely get that again.    The chimi was full of delicious carne asada.  They really know their stuff here.  The meat was good quality and so tender it melted in my mouth.  I had half for dinner and then the other half the next morning with an egg on top.  DEE-licious!    And the churro was a nice sweet way to end the meal.  My total before tip was $10.42.  I was very impressed with the attention to detail and the flavors.  The enchilada sauce had a great blend of seasonings that was way better than any I've had before.   I look forward to trying more items on their menu.  Gracias, Mucho Taco.

I had purchased two 80-dollar Groupons for myself and the Mr. and we used them a couple of days after Christmas.  What I love about the spa is that if you book one service, you can spend the whole day enjoying the other amenities.   We were out there for 6+ hours and had a completely relaxing time.  Started with the complimentary yoga class, moved on to massages, and then a pedicure for me.  Then lunch and drinks, and lounging in and by the pool and hot tub.  Lovely time and a great Christmas present to ourselves.  The immune booster smoothie and the hummus were both good, but the pasilla flat bread pizza is EXCELLENT!    The employees were very gracious and friendly and overall I would love to save my pennies and go back twice a year at least.  The only negative at all had nothing to do with the spa.  There were a group of ladies there from New York and oh my were they noisy.  Everywhere.  Thankfully they weren't around for long.  I guess those quiet zone signs didn't apply to them.  I would love to be the person who walks around and politely tells people to be considerate and use their library voices.   People pay a lot of money to go out there and they don't need to hear some loudmouth yapping about their mother-in-law and their ungrateful kids and their cruddy job.    One of the employees told me that after March they usually have some great package deals so I plan to keep my eyes out for those.  It felt like a vacation, but was very close to home.

I have been on a quest for good customer service in my part of the city, and wow I found it at Dillard's!  Normally the thought of going to the mall makes me nauseated and break out in a rash, but sometimes I have to go.    Mr. M and I had to go to get him a nice new suit, and me a nice new party dress for an upcoming wedding reception.    Now, I'm going to have to dig through Mr. M's receipts and find the young man's name who helped us, but he was stellar and put up with all my stupid comments and questions like, "That's too shiny"  "Nope.  Don't like the stripes" "Doesn't that make his butt look good?"  That poor guy.    Super prices, quality, and selection and they took care of some alterations.  I was impressed with the attention to detail on the hem for the pants, and he had great input on tie selection.  Top notch!  Then, when it comes to me shopping for myself, I am totally out of practice.  I used to have to dress like a banker and had better habits.  Now I dress kind of like I could be beach-ready in 2.4 seconds.    Sooooo..... I sucked it up and went back to Dillard's this morning.  I met a great saleswoman who had helpful recommendations on colors for the dress and fit, and some great tips for shoes.  I found a great Calvin Klein dress and shoes that are going to make everyone who sees me think, "Wow!  She can dress like a girl!", and the prices didn't break the bank.  The saleswoman who helped me and the dude in the shoe department were both outstanding!   Now I actually look forward to going back to the mall.

The first time I had Rubio's ever was about 6 months ago in Casa Grande.  Now I'm hooked.  Love the original fish taco, and now I'm also really enjoying the shrimp salsa verde tacos that I think are out for a limited time only.  So fresh and delicious!  This particular location has very friendly staff, and when we were there over the weekend one employee was moving tables and scrubbing the walls and floor.  The joint was clean anyway, but how often do you see an employee taking the time to do a deep clean?  A lot of places I visit I don't even want to look at the floor/wall/behind the chairs.  Best to stay in the dark, but this place is as clean as it can be.    I also like the choices on the salsa bar and the fact that I can get a cold adult beverage to have with my tacos.   I've never had a bad visit to a Rubio's.  Definitely a fan.

You know I could eat breakfast food every meal of the day.  Well, the meals when I'm not eating hot dogs, pizza, tacos, burgers, or gyros.  We hadn't been to Wanda's in over 2 years and I really have no reason why.  It's a nice little local joint that cranks out some good standard breakfast food.  They've remodeled since I've been there and the colors inside are very pleasant.    We rolled in this morning and ordered the King breakfast which comes with 2 eggs, hash browns, bacon, and a pancake.  We also got the two egg combo which is the same but with a biscuit and gravy instead of a pancake.  Now granted, we were hungry, but once the food arrived there was very little talking.  Just eating.  Great breakfast!  And we hustled on out of there because the joint is small and our server said a party of 30-40 would be arriving around 9:00.  The food is always good and the staff is always friendly.  I'll be sure to go back more often.

I've only had breakfasts here, but they do a really nice job.  I love the ham and brie frittata.  So simple, but always tastes good.  Every time I eat one I think I could make one at home, but I never do!  The bacon breakfast sandwich is delicious as well with the fresh greens and fluffy bun.  My husband always gets the 2 egg breakfast and enjoys that as well.  For the longest time I forgot they were over here in the mall and we would head to Chompie's.  But now if we feel like a quieter atmosphere in the morning we'll hit Wildflower.  I really need to come back and try the lunch stuff.  It all sounds really good and I love a good soup and sandwich combo.    The staff is really friendly and helpful here and they have good coffee that will pry my eyes open in the morning.  All in all, it's the simple things done well.  Definitely a fan.

I don't even know where to start with Z'Tejas.  I guess it started with the one on Mill, but we live closer to this one on Ray near I-10.  The one on Mill is great for people watching and I have taken visitors there straight from the airport when they are starving to death after their flight.  The menu has a wide variety of choices, something for everyone.  The service has always been a bit slow on Mill, but they also have been very busy when I've been there.  I love that they are usually quick in bringing out that wonderful warm cornbread to tide you over.  I prefer the one on Ray for happy hour and for Sunday brunch.  For happy hour a couple of 6th Street margaritas, sharing some tostada bites and the street tacos make my belly extremely happy.  The husband and I can fuel up before our shopping excursion to BevMo across the street.    The barbacoa enchiladas have been a favorite of mine for years and it was a eureka moment when I discovered that for Sunday brunch they serve the same enchiladas, but add two eggs cooked to order.  That dish with two eggs over easy on top is positively moan-worthy.  Love it.  We've also tried the mac and cheese and it's really good, but really rich.  I recommend sharing that one.  I usually just stick with the 6th street margs, but have tried a couple of other drinks.  And I seem to remember some kind of white sangria cocktail that was very tasty.  I always look forward to going to Z'Tejas.  Been there about 15 times in the past couple of years and never had a bad experience.

On 3/11 we had a perfect brunch at Z'Tejas.  Is this 5-star dining?  Technically no, but everything from drinks to food to service was perfect that Sunday.  I ordered the Eggs Bene Z' Style which has the poached eggs on top of their delicious cornbread with chipotle hollandaise and jalapeno bacon, and a side of breakfast potatoes.  I've got to get over being bashful with my camera because this was a good-looking dish, and tasted even better.  If you're feeling a little adventurous give it a try, you won't be disappointed.  Every aspect of that dish was perfect and I'm still thinking about it.  Mr. M ordered the Hickory Burger and that was another item worthy of a picture.  Cooked medium rare as he ordered it, the smoky flavors were delicious and the sweet potato fries were very good as well.  I can't rave enough about the service.  We had a couple of the $4 mimosas and then for dessert shared a ginger something something martini.    We sat in the bar area and were greeted immediately with an explanation of the bloody mary/mimosa bar options.  The bartender brought us the champagne, and then we added our choice of juice.  The mango juice is a phenomenal choice.  When it came time for the ginger something something martini, we said we were going to share it.  The bartender was so funny and said he didn't want any fighting over the drink, so he made it with 2 glasses and we each got a healthy pour of about 2/3rds the glass.  That drink was one to savor, with I think crystallized ginger on the rim.  Delicious!  Two bartenders took care of us and I wish I would have caught their names because they were prompt, friendly, and funny.  5-stars all the way.  Can't wait to go back!

Our second visit to The Keg was on New Year's Eve.  Our first was sometime during the summer for happy hour.  It was one of those days that was seriously 113 degrees or so and I remember when I walked in to the bar I couldn't see anything.  It was so dark.  Normally I like that, but I had a hard time finding my husband.  I was thrilled when I put my hand on the right man.  My next thought was how much I liked the seating in the bar.  You can sit at the bar, they have high tops, they have cozy little seats along one wall, they have long tables for groups, and they have comfortable leather chairs along the front windows and by the fireplace.  Love the bar area.    That visit we sat at the bar and had mojitos and shared an app and the bone-in ribeye.  Had an excellent time all around.  New Year's Eve is my husband's birthday as well, and this year he wanted to come back to The Keg for dinner.  This time we sat at one of the high tops and Kennedy took great care of us.  We ordered the calamari app and 2 of the bourbon maple martinis to start.  The calamari ($11) is great.  Nice and lightly fried and they have a few fried red bell peppers and jalapenos throughout for added flavor.  Enjoyed that a lot.  The drinks are very nice and made with Woodford Reserve, I just didn't think they were a great value at 10 bucks apiece.  More like $7 or $8.  He ordered the bone-in ribeye ($36 - 20 oz) again along with the twice-baked potato.  I'm convinced that is a perfect meal.  5-star all around.  Steak was a perfect med rare and the potato was just delicious with its rich buttery, bacony flavor.  I ordered the chicken and ribs ($28) with a side of vegetables instead of the fries and slaw.  There was nothing exciting or interesting about this meal.  Very generic flavors and the ribs were not very tender.  I wish I would have gotten something else.  Next time I'll probably go back to getting a steak.  With my meal I had the Angry Orchard ginger apple cider and that was delicious.  Mr. M ordered a glass of old vine zin to have with his steak.  That was very nice as well.  Total after tax, before tip was $121.08.  We will definitely go back to The Keg, but as we get to know the menu I'm learning what to avoid.  Great place overall.

5-star Happy Hour!  We had a bunch of beverages and a bunch of food for 35 bucks!  Can you believe that?  The bartender...I think his name is Geoffrey...took great care of us.    Next time we need to leave room for a pizookie.    That Harvest Hefeweizen is so good it took me back to old Bavaria AND made me blaspheme.  Now that's a great beer!  We always enjoy stopping in at BJ's.

Review #300.  It was a tough choice, but I think this one is it.  Short and sweet.  We won $100 in the neighborhood Christmas light contest and with that VISA gift card firmly in hand, we decided to spend it at GCM.  Never been there before, but how could we go wrong, right?  That dude from San Diego's review pushed us over the top.  We're going.  We walked in and were greeted right away even though it was pretty busy on Christmas Eve, and ended up leaving with some delicious beers and even more delicious bourbon.  Only had to pay 13 bucks out of pocket.  Thank you HOA for the 100 bucks.  We're going to win the $250 next year!  And a HUGE thanks to GCM for being a great stop much closer to home than the big chain stores.  We'll see you again soon.

I'm going to give them a 4, even though I waffle around on this a little bit.  3....3.5....Some things Flancer's does very well, like their fresh bread....amazing!.....and that BLT.  Holy moley that was good!  Love the fresh avocado on that.  And awhile back I had a soup called beef poblano or something like that, and it was exceptional as well.  The Do You Feel Like I Fondue app was really tasty and rich, with green chiles, tender chicken, and lots of cheese, but I'm not sure how they call that fondue.  See the pic.  It's just a dip.  But then, there are the things that are not so good.  The baked potato soup we had last night was not good at all.  OK on the consistency of the soup, but it tasted like it was almost scorched and only had 3 small potatoes.  I don't know if the intention was to be more like a bisque, but usually when I have potato soup it has chucks of potato in it.  And I think the temp was too high, and/or ours came from the bottom of the pot, because it had a hint of a scorched flavor.  My husband ordered the veggie side with the BLT and it was over half onions.  We've had a soggy pizza from them before too.  I think they could improve their beer selection a little for marketing the fact that they have a good beer selection.  Usually it's a couple of local stand-bys and then they get something else on a rotating selection.  Last night it was New Belgium's Ranger IPA which we tried and was ok, but there are usually a limited number of choices.  To me if you're going to promote that you have a good beer selection you have a lot of choices.  You don't have to be Boulders on Broadway or Papago Brewing, but I don't know, maybe 8 or 10 would be nice instead of 4 or 5.  Shock Top is not a craft beer, and the choices of Bud Light, Coors Light, Miller Lite, and Michelob Ultra remind me of an old joke about what do having sex in a canoe and light beer have in common?   There's a prickly pear lemonade that's pretty good, but really, the only reason we went last night was to burn up a Groupon.    I don't know how often I'd go back.  Right now the construction around Gilbert and Guadalupe is very annoying, but I don't hold that against the restaurant.  They just seem to be a little inconsistent and I don't like the claustrophobic feel of this location.  There also have always been a lot of loud kids when we have been there.  Maybe in the future I'll just get a BLT to go and be extremely happy with that.

The map picture for this one is incorrect.  This location is actually at Alma School and Germann, in the Fry's plaza.  I'll give a place 3 strikes before I say something heavily negative, and this is it for this joint.  One employee, Jim, has ruined it for me.  I don't know if he's just an old school chauvinist, or if he's deeply insecure and mean-spirited, but he's waited on me 3 times.  Every time condescending and rude.  And the last time I was so irritated, I just wanted to get out of there and when I got to the car I realized he didn't give me my change.  It was only a nickel, so no big deal.  I hope he can use that towards a customer service class.    If he's not there, it's fine and I like all the services that The UPS Store offers.  I used to travel all over the country for a company who has a corporate account with them and I would always get A+ service no matter where I went.  In the future I will use a different location.

Normally I have a strict policy against leaving the house on Saturdays due to all the people out running their errands and running over whoever gets in their way, but this morning, Captain Douchebag next door decides to fire up all his power tools at 7:00 a.m., so I thought, what the heck....I'll go out and knock out the stuff on my list.  I had already had a bad experience at Target.  Grabbed a cart, which happened to come with a dirty diaper!  WTF is wrong with people?  Then I got behind a woman who kept trying 14 different maxed out credit cards and it took me forever in the check out lane.  I am not having a good feeling at this point.  I should have gotten a breakfast burrito and immediately gone home.  But I had one more stop that I really wanted to make.    I had a book on hold at Hamilton Library that I needed for a class, so I thought I'd swing in there a little after 9 and pick it up.  Now, I am the first to admit when I'm wrong, and at the time I truly thought their Saturday hours were 9-5.  I walk in, find my book, and start using the self-checkout.  Suddenly I hear, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?!?!?!?!?"      Uh.....this is a library....I'm not sure what else I'd be doing.    "WE ARE NOT OPEN!  HOW DID YOU GET IN?!?!?"    I pointed to the door that I always come in, and said, "The door right there."  An older gal who has the same hairdo Priscilla Presley had when she married Elvis, proceeded to totally attempt to make me feel like an idiot.  "YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT!"  "Do you mean I can't take the book I just checked out?"  "DID YOU SEE THE SIGN OUT FRONT?  YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE!!  ARE YOU FINISHED?  OUR HOURS ARE 1-5.  YOU NEED TO GO DOWNTOWN!! WELL GO AHEAD!!"  "I'm truly sorry if I startled you, but don't you open at 9?"    "THAT IS THE DOWNTOWN LOCATION ONLY!  THERE'S A SIGN OUT FRONT!  WE ARE NOT OPEN!"  Her diatribe was filled with many sighs and eye rolls.  Oh boy.  Her Monday-Friday job must be with TSA.    Then I said something that's just as dorky as saying, "oopsie daisy".  I said, "Jiminy, I didn't mean to upset you.  Sorry."  Jiminy.  Oh yeah.  Who says that?  I'm a dork.  She caught me off guard.  Maybe it's because in my day job I frequently have to correct people and I do it in a way that's friendly, at times humorous, and educational so they actually learn.  It's not rocket science, but yelling at and berating people doesn't really tend to work very well.    Normally I find this location slightly frustrating anyway.  I've learned to avoid the peak high school comings and goings, but they put up a one way only sign for the library parking lot, and if you follow the sign, on weekends, it takes you to a locked gate.  Makes no sense.  So, I have to turn around and go against the one way, which everyone else does anyway because the entrance/exit is right on Arizona Ave.  As I left, I realized I should have asked her, "Who left the door unlocked?"

I don't know why I went down here to old people land.  Oh, I know, because it's the same distance to another Basha's, and I know this one is generally less busy.  I grabbed my 10 items or less and headed to the front.  It was very early and there was only one register open.  As I paid I got $40 cash back and you would have thought I personally took it out of the cashier's pocket.  She huffed and puffed and grumbled about how the last guy gave her a hundred and she's cleaned out again....  Sounds to me like you NEED to get cleaned out, but that's beside the point.  I smiled and said, "Sorry to put you out."  She crossed her arms and pouted.  I'm thinkin', isn't that why they pay someone $1.00/hour more than her, to be called a front end manager and go get more change?  Hmmm.  Kinda feel sorry for her the more that I think about it.  The front end manager probably doesn't like her either.

I need to show this Arby's some Yelp love.  I've probably been there 2 dozen times in the past 3 years and the food is always fresh and fast, and the employees are always friendly.  I was a bit disappointed when they stopped serving breakfast because their bacon, egg, & cheese croissants are waaaaay better than those gut bomb croissanmiches that BK sells.  But, I don't need to eat that stuff very often anyway, so it's ok.  I've had the new smokehouse brisket sandwich twice now and it's really good.  I think they could put a few more of those fried onions on it because I think the two times I've had it there've been like two.  It's still a great sandwich.  The brisket is very tender and smoky and you can't beat smoked gouda.    For years I used to crave a Beef and Cheddar, but once I lived in St. Louis and had roast beast sandwiches at Lion's Choice I could never go back to Arby's for that.  I do enjoy the roast turkey and swiss sandwich at Arby's and have found that to be a good option when I'm traveling and my only choices are an Arby's, a Sonic, or a gas station.  That's really a tasty sandwich too.  I'm not big on fries or soda, but they usually have decent tea so I get by.

I'm weird.  I believe in smiling at people and saying please and thank you.  And in saying, "Can I help you?"  "How are you doing today?"  You'll get none of that nonsense at this Fry's.  I know a guy who is friends with a department manager for Fry's.  He said they had a "customer service" push one time, telling their employees to ask customers if they were finding everything they need, and to tell them thank you.  AFTER THEY HAND OVER THEIR HARD-EARNED MONEY AND KEEP YOU EMPLOYED!  Ugh.  It is sad you have to tell people to do this.  This just reinforces I live in a Bermuda Triangle of bad customer service.  This morning I got cut off on my quest for yogurt by an employee checking her phone.  She was smiling, but it wasn't at me.  I have a feeling it was at the naughty message on her phone.  That is great use of company time.  Then I stood patiently at the Tully's counter while two geriatrics gave me the X-ray, how-you-doin little lady look.  No employee in sight.  I even wandered around looking for one.  So I had to risk my life in the Cobblestone parking lot to get some caffeine at Dunkin' Donuts.  God I hate that parking lot.  And so, I'm done done doneski with Fry's and continue on my quest for good customer service in the Alma School/Queen Creek corridor.

I have to thank Georgie for his recent review, otherwise I might not have known this place existed.  I was talking with my buddy Tim a few weeks ago about low carb diets, so what does that make me immediately crave?  BREAD.  After I read Georgie's review I realized I can't think of the last time I've had a good bagel.    After two visits to Back East I can say they are definitely good to great, but not better than The Bagel Man.  Back East's bagels are light and chewy and the breakfast sandwiches are pretty good.  I love a good cinnamon sugar bagel and thank God I discovered this joint so I never have to step foot in an Einstein Bros. again.  The first cinnamon sugar bagel I had at Back East was absolutely perfect and was almost like eating a cinnamon roll without the icing.  I love that they put the cinn/sug all over the bagel, not just on top.  I ordered another one this morning and it was a bit smaller and harder on one side.  I'm sure it's difficult to make them all the same all the time, but the one today just wasn't as light and tasty as the one I had the other day.  This morning I got the breakfast sandwich with the green chile cheddar bagel and that is a delicious bagel as well!  I've never tried one before, but I really enjoyed that and I heard a lot of people ordering it while I was in the shop.    To accompany my breakfast I ordered a blended mocha and they do give you your choice of milk and with or without whipped cream.  For $3.99 it's a large drink, but I thought the flavor was kind of weak and for a blended drink there were quite a few pieces of ice still in it.  That drink was just a 2.5/5 for me.  They do have a lot of choices for coffee drinks so I'm sure I can find something I like better the next time.    Overall I'm definitely a fan and would come back.  I'd much rather patronize a place like this than the chains.  They have great deals on large purchases and a wide variety of lunch sandwiches as well.

I grew up eating those Seitz hot dogs that came in the silver package and on sale you could get 4 packs for a dollar or something like that.  They were awful, and I'm pretty sure if I get any chronic or terminal illnesses, it's going to be from eating about a thousand of those.  Then I lived in Orlando for a few years and became a regular at Hot Dog Heaven.  Now THIS is a hot dog!  Then I started paying more attention.  Well, on Saturday Mr. M and I were on a hot dog cruise and stood in the very long line at Ted's to order 2 jumbos with cheese & mustard, mine also with relish, a bottle of water, and a chocolate shake.  The total was $15.55 and reminded me that I really need to remember to carry our own water with us.  That would have saved 2 bucks.   Anyway, HEY, back to the dogs....chargrilled and perfect!  I was taken back to Hot Dog Heaven and we both thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  The milkshake was rich, chocolatey deliciousness too.  I will definitely get a craving for Ted's and can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu.

4.5/5 for sports bar food/atmosphere  Something is going to kill me someday and it might as well be bacon.  This place has the best BLT I have ever had.  They bread and fry the tomatoes, folks.  I had never heard of that before.  Eating the BLT at Teakwoods has made me want to start a Yelp list of the best BLTs.  It's that good.  Go get it.  With the sweet potato waffle fries.  It just can't be beat.  The last time we were there we also tried the 1/2 bacon cheeseburger lavosh.  That was delicious too.  First of all, the 1/2 lavosh are HUGE!  I don't know what I'd do if we ever got a full-size one.  Probably have to drag another table over to make room for that monster.  The bacon cheeseburger one has ground beef, onions, tomatoes, bacon, lettuce, cheese, and a thousand island drizzle.  Tastes like a Big Mac if a Big Mac actually contained good-quality hamburger.  Perfect with a couple of cold beers.    So a BLT and the lavosh weren't enough on our last visit.  Apparently we had to order even more food and also had the shrimp and chips entree.  I wasn't expecting anything beyond average, but this again was pretty damn tasty with a big serving of fried shrimp and steak fries.  Everything was cooked perfectly and not greasy at all.  They also have jalapeno cole slaw, and you know what a wuss I am when it comes to anything spicy, but I ended up enjoying that as well.  Good cole slaw taken to great with that nice jalapeno flavor.  We ended up leaving with 3 togo containers that day!    We've been to all of the Teakwoods locations several times and really enjoy a few things.  First, the employees have always been friendly and efficient, they take bar food and put a little twist on it to make it different and more delicious than you would think, and they usually have some pretty good drink choices.   They don't water down their drinks like those pinheads at Zipps, and there are always a bunch of TVs tuned to the sporting event of your choice as well.  Teakwoods is definitely one of our favorite sports bars in the area.

I am sad that Lucky's is so far from where we live.  I worked near Lucky's last year and just happened to walk in for lunch.  My lunch was so good I took a huge meat lovers pie home, which was so good my husband proposed all over again!  The employees were so friendly and explained that their pizza might take a little longer than normal, but they want to make sure it's right.  I loved everything about my visit there, and was able to stop in a couple more times throughout the year.  It's about an hour drive from where I live, but the more I think about it, I think we're going to have to go get some more Lucky's pizza.  Great neighborhood pizza place!

I'm going to stay in so many hotels the rest of this year, that I'm going to try to figure out how to sum up the PROS of a property in 5 words or less, in order of importance to me:  Clean Comfortable Quiet Friendly  Internet  I can't do 5 words.  I spent 3 nights here last week.  The lobby is under construction for the next week I think, so there was no in-house booze while I was there, but it will be back soon.  Breakfast was fine.  Nothing outstanding about it, nothing bad either.  Staff is top notch here.  Free parking and easy access to the strip without the noise.   Would have been nice to have a mini-fridge in the room for yogurt and water.  Oh who am I kidding?  For ginger ale to go with my Jameson.

Saw Mike Birbiglia last night and visited the Mesa Arts Center for the first time.  As others have mentioned, what a beautiful complex!  The Ikeda Theater is roomy and I don't think there is a bad seat in the house.  The ushers were very friendly and helpful, although someone should have bonked that idiot who kept putting his feet on the stage in the head.  What an amazing display of douchebaggery.  Would you put your feet on the table where a Master Chef is working?  I think not.    It was also lovely walking out after the show under the lights and the canopies.  I look forward to returning.

I saw Bonnie Raitt in the Ikeda Theater this past Sunday night, and what a concert!  I've been to dozens of concerts, and this one is in my top 3 now.  This was my first time hearing a musical performance in this venue and the sound quality is amazing.  Ms. Raitt even called it a "beautiful church".  I can't say enough good things about this theater.  The ushers are always friendly and helpful, it's easy to navigate with several elevators and wide stairs, and restrooms are plentiful.  The only drawback Sunday night was that it was incredibly slow to get a cocktail, but no worries.  Mr. M and I can wait, drink better scotch at home, and save our $8/per.

Mr. M and I saw Lyle Lovett and his Large Band last night in the Ikeda Theater and in spite of the woman next to me talking loudly throughout the show and wearing 14 gallons of an awful perfume----I don't have a sensitive sniffer so if it irritates my sinuses, it should probably have a Hazmat sticker on it.  In spite of the couple in front of us in the balcony who violated every rule of concert etiquette you can think of, including:  hanging over the edge of the balcony and blocking our view with the cowboy hat perched on the Mr.'s empty noggin and talking on the phone during the show.  They leaned so far over the balcony rail that I was sure I'd see at least the hat take a dive, and maybe even Darwin's law get enacted, and Dipshit McDoucherson would go on over after it.....but.....no that didn't happen.  That would be sad for the innocent victims that moron would have landed on.   There is something seriously wrong with some people.  And in spite of the fact that it was kind of warm in the Theater ----hey it's August in the desert....The entire evening I never really felt that nice refreshing chill of A/C.    ...the concert was amazing.  Lyle and his band were phenomenal.  The amount of talent on that stage.....well, I'm so glad we went.  The sound in the Ikeda Theater just blows me away.  I'm still trying to figure out where I really like to sit so I'll keep trying other areas.  #12, seats 1 and 2 in the balcony were not great for us, but I knew going in it was limited visibility.  I just didn't think I would have an idiot hanging over the railing in front of us.  Where was the usher?  They are all over the place, and last night I noticed they were so absorbed in the concert the ones around me really weren't paying attention to the patrons and their shenanigans.    If you haven't been here yet you really need to check their schedule and go.  Like I said, the sound is amazing in this beautiful theater, it's easy to get up and down to the different levels, there are plenty of bathrooms, and walking out after the show is so pleasant.  This complex is beautifully designed.

Oh I got my band geek back on now!  I haven't stepped foot in a music store in almost 20 years, but I'm going to start playing the piano again and my husband also wants to learn.  I couldn't believe the selection in everything.  Tons of sheet music to dig through, at all levels of experience, and then a great selection on instruments.  Hmmm....I may decide to really geek out and get a sax and a flute again.  They give lessons.  They do repairs.  This is heaven to me.  So glad we finally stopped in.

On my drive home from the library this morning I realized I've probably had a library card for 40 years.  I love books and I love libraries.  Always have.  As a kid they were a refuge for me and I've embraced them ever since.  I love the way they smell and I love finding a quiet corner and thumbing through some books.  One of the first things I do when I move someplace new is get a library card.  When I traveled all over the country for 10 years I would sometimes stop in at the local library just to check it out.  And I love going into big libraries in major cities like New York and Chicago.  Keep your crowded museums and overpriced restaurants.  I'll be over here poking around in the stacks.    In my middle age, after having moved a couple thousand books every time I move, I've cut back somewhat on the amount of books I buy and rely on the library much more often.  My husband and I also love to watch movies and I'll check out movies that I haven't seen in awhile but may not want to own, or movies that I'm curious about but they received horrible reviews.  Today I picked up Inherent Vice and Burt Wonderstone.  I'm sure I'll be glad I didn't pay a nickel to watch either of them, but you never know.  Sometimes I find a hidden gem.  This library is large and nicely laid out, with a shop and cafe up front, and the reserved books and checkouts are up front too, so it makes it nice and easy to get in and out if I want to.  The staff are always friendly and helpful as well.  When I had an issue at the Hamilton Library a couple of years ago, the Library Director was all over that and sent me a very professional message right away.  I'm totally impressed.  I can't imagine what she has to coordinate and respond to on a daily basis.    After this morning though, I'll probably hold off on returning to this location, at least until the election is over.  It seems like every other visit there's an issue of some kind out front.  Sometimes there's an aggressive panhandler.  There are frequently the "impeach Sheriff Joe" petitioners out front, and I'm all for their right to be out there gathering signatures, but a few years ago I tried to engage them in polite conversation, especially because I was new to the area.  Tell me why you don't like Sheriff Joe.  "He's mean to people."  OK.  Can you give me some examples?  Do you have any suggestions for solutions?  "No.  We need to get rid of him first."  Etc. Etc.  I just got to the point that I tell them I am not a resident or I already signed it and just wish them well.  That keeps the conversation short and friendly.  Keep on keepin' on, but I have a hard time respecting people who can't provide valid reasons for their position, or provide an alternative.  And I certainly wouldn't sign their petition.  And a couple of times I've been harassed by men sitting on the bench out front.  "Hey baby.  Where's your man?  Can you give me a ride?  I know you can give me a ride".  Stuff like that.  Why yes.  Since you were so charming I'll leave my husband and my life right now and run off with you.  Give me a break.    It's nothing I can't handle, but this morning was a little too much.  The petitioners were out and were nice to me, but as I was leaving one of them was arguing with a woman and they were yelling every 4-letter word you can imagine at each other.  In front of children and everybody in the area.  It was a disgusting display.  Do you all realize you are arguing about politicians who don't care about any of us?  You get that, right?  No you don't.  This year the ugly is coming out in all kinds of ways, and I went from my usual sarcastic, cynical state of mind, to disturbed and a little upset.  I just don't need that garbage in my life, and I felt really bad for the father and son I was walking out with who had to witness that.    I don't know if they have anyone on the library staff who is scary, but you know what I'm talking about...those people who you know don't tolerate any nonsense from the moment they walk into a room.  Right that minute I wished one of those people would walk out and tell those two idiots to knock it off.  It's not really the library's fault, but I'll probably visit the Sunset branch for a few months.  I've never seen anyone hanging around out front the few times I've been at that location.  I'm just to the point that I dread walking around the corner from the parking lot to the entrance, and I'm not a person who scares or offends easily.

We live near so much good pizza that it's incredibly hard to choose now.  I had not eaten at Venezia's until almost 2 months ago, and we did the lunch special with a slice and a salad and a drink.  I forget the exact total, but it runs right around 6 bucks.  GREAT deal and GREAT pizza.  Then, we've gotten delivery twice and I am so impressed with their website and online ordering system.  It's the best I've ever used.  You can customize the order, apply a coupon code, and pay online.  Both times we've ordered online we got our pizza in approximately 45 minutes.  And both times the driver was very friendly and had the cc receipt all ready for me to sign.    We've had the Meat Lovers, Pesto w/ artichokes & sausage, and the Hawaiian and enjoyed them all.  This pizza really reminds me of pizza I've had in NY.  The toppings are fresh and the crust is the right amount of yeasty chewiness.  Right now, Venezia's is my #1 choice for pizza.

I am so glad I finally made it over here to try Hoosier Café.  GREAT breakfasts!  The first time I went by myself and had the half Belgian waffle breakfast.  That was the perfect amount of food.  Then I took my husband back and we loaded up and tried a couple of things.  I had a delicious California omelet with fresh avocado, and the B & G were old school.  Soft, fluffy biscuits and peppery sausage gravy.  That's the way it should be done.    I've seen the same servers both times and they seem like they've worked together a long time.  Like a well-oiled machine they take care of everybody with a smile.    As a side benefit I got a huge kick out of the table of geriatric regulars reading from the newspaper and talking politics.  Our world needs more of that.  One dude was eyeballing me the time I was there alone.  I figured I was either in his usual seat (which is more likely the reason) or he was wondering if I'd be offended by their comments about Hillary Clinton.  Heck no!  Comment away!  It's a free country.  Well, for now anyway.  Unless you have a dissenting  opinion on certain topics, or try to carry a plastic bag around in Bisbee.    Reasonable prices, great service, stimulating conversation, and excellent food!  I may have found my new favorite breakfast spot.

Went to Brunchie's for the first time today because I've had a serious craving for biscuits and gravy that's been haunting me for the past month or so.  They had something on the menu called the Southern biscuit that includes B & G and 2 eggs and 2 pieces of bacon (or a sausage patty).  That's what I ordered and it was excellent.  The sausage gravy has a healthy amount of sausage pieces in it, and it's peppery, but not too peppery.  Bacon and eggs were cooked perfectly.  I tell ya, if you like egg yolk dripping onto a biscuit, this is the way to go!  The portion was so huge I brought home more than half to have for breakfast tomorrow.  Or, maybe this afternoon.  My husband had their basic breakfast with bacon, eggs, hash browns, and a biscuit on the side.  Everything was cooked just like he likes it.  Their biscuits are interesting.  It's obvious they are homemade but the texture isn't quite like a biscuit I'm used to.  Kind of a cross between a biscuit and a scone.  I liked it because I like dense bread.  And they stand up to the gravy well without falling apart.    The coffee was good and strong, but nothing special on the flavor.  Overall I would definitely come back for a good basic breakfast.  The only con has nothing to do with them.  A family towards the front had a screaming baby that went on and on.  Really ridiculous to subject everyone to that.  We were towards the back so it wasn't so bad, but people really need to remove their crumbsnatchers when a tantrum ensues.

You can't really tell from the street but this is quite a nice shop.  It's bigger than I thought too.  I've sped by this place I don't know how many times, and I've finally gotten to a point where I was looking for a cheap used flute so I can start playing again.  Then after I get my wind & tone back and get good again, I'll upgrade.  And maybe audition for one of the local orchestras.  That would be pretty cool, huh?    When I walked in there were 2 gentlemen working and they both greeted me right away.  I pretty much knew what I wanted so it was a quick transaction.  I got an inexpensive flute that has been checked over and cleaned up so it's in good condition and they also gave me the name of a top notch instructor.  No complaints.  I look forward to a continuing relationship with Brindley's as I get back into music.

I really can't add much that hasn't already been said.  If you love good beer, and being around people who love good beer, this place is THE BEST.  We always have great service and most recently we tried the white pizza and it was delicious.  I wish we lived closer.  Or, maybe it's good that we don't live closer.   One of our favorite places in the Phoenix area for sure.

A little over 5 years ago Mr. M came to me and said, "Do you hate winter?  I hate winter".  I said, "I've always hated winter".  And then we started plans to move to Arizona.  I had been here many times over the years, but he had never been to the desert.  So you know me with my wily ways, I planned a fantastic scouting trip in the middle of March and we left St. Louis crappy winter/early spring weather to spend 4 days here in the Phoenix metro area.  One of the things we did was visit Rula Bula around St. Paddy's day and had great food, even better drinks, and got to see the Keltic Cowboys play. That was one of the rare nights in the past 10 years where I stayed up until 2 a.m.!!  What a great time.  Ever since then we've been back maybe 2 dozen times over the years and always have a great time.  For us we really enjoy getting some exercise around Tempe Town Lake and then rolling in here around 2 in the afternoon.  It's usually quiet and we can gab with the bartender and have a relaxing time.    On our most recent visit, about 2 weeks before Christmas, we stopped in on a Sunday completely unaware that they have a weekend brunch menu.  I had the traditional benedict plus avocado and really enjoyed that one.  I loved the fact that they put it on puff pastry instead of a heavier bread item.  I usually have to take half home, but this time I ate it all by myself and only let Mr. M have one teeny bite.    The Black Velvet cocktail on the menu sounded interesting and it was.  Champagne with some Guinness floating on top.  Pretty to look at and even better to drink.  We now have some Guinness and cheap champagne in the fridge to make one of those whenever we want.  Mr. M had his usual Guinness BBQ wings and some Jameson on the rocks.  No complaints there.  Jody took great care of us at the bar.  All in with the food and drinks it was $32.90 before tax and tip.  We always look forward to a visit to Rula Bula.

We visited Big Surf for the first time yesterday and overall had a great time.  I have a groupon for $13 admission, but when I noticed it was BOGO Tuesday, we saved the groupons for later.  Our work schedule allows for Mondays and Tuesdays off so it was perfect.  Not crowded at all.  I think a lot of the kiddos are back in school too.  I would never go to this place on a weekend.  I avoid most things like this on weekends.  You're just asking for crowds and long lines, so those that complain about that stuff when they go on a Saturday need to have their head examined.  The lifeguards were friendly yet professional and we noticed there were plenty of them all over the place to monitor what's going on.  We rented a locker which was not the best scenario because you have to wait to use the machine to get back into it and of course I'd get stuck behind someone who acted like they've never seen a keypad before.  It wasn't too bad because it wasn't busy, but I can't imagine the wait when it gets close to closing time.  From reading some of the other reviews, I didn't even think about keeping stuff in the car and going back out to get it instead of using a locker.  I didn't know they'd let you go in and out of the park.  That's pretty cool and what I'll do next time.  Everything was clean except the women's bathroom floor had quite a bit of water that wasn't draining anywhere.  Could use a squeegy every so often.  My husband is 46 and has never been to a waterpark in his life and after the first trip down that tornado twister slide he said, "THAT was worth the price of admission!".  We'll definitely be back and next year will probably buy the season passes.  We did not have any food while we were there but the pizza smelled really good.  It seemed like a great place for families to have a really fun time together.

We've been here several times and really enjoy Casey Moore's.  Every time I'm in this neighborhood too, it makes me want to move out of stucco hell into a neighborhood that actually has some character and interesting homes.    Mr. M used to have a weekday off and we'd be those people that roll in around 1:30 or 2:00 in the afternoon and just hang out and drink and talk and share some food and have our own little slow food movement going on for a few hours.  It was nice.  Now, no more weekdays off.    I've enjoyed going on a few Friday nights after I get in to Sky Harbor, and having a few drinks and good food to wind down after a long work week.  We discovered the people watching is WAY better on weekend nights too!  Who knew?!?!?  I get a kick out of the old men eyeballing the young chicks who have their clothing positioned just so around their tattoos, the real hippies, not hipsters in their little costumes, but real hippies, and just generally a happy, chilled out crowd.  It's a cool place with good service, good food, and good patrons.  We haven't ordered anything we didn't like, but some favorites are the crab cakes, the steamed clams, the burgers, and any cocktail with Jameson in it.  Or just some Jameson.  Bring us the bottle.  I finally saw one of those gnarly cats someone commented about.  DANG!  You're right.  Those things look like something else chewed on them and spit them out.  Or maybe the birds and cats have frequent smack downs by the dumpster.  I don't know, but if you sit outside you need to be ok with the wildlife hovering nearby.

I love Trader Joe's.  We need one in south Chandler.  I make the not-too-far trek about once a month or so and load up on greens, avocados, canned artichokes (I put those in everything), some cheap wine, and whatever else catches my eye.  This store is also in a great plaza with Changing Hands bookstore, Wildflower bakery, a Walgreens, and Mac's Broiler & Tap, to name a few.    I'm not sure how I feel about the kiddie carts.  On the one hand I believe in putting kids to work and if they can schlep some groceries around the store, then great, there's more room for wine in mommy's cart, but on the other hand, they are usually in the way.  Of everybody.  This morning there was a mother and daughter, probably 4 yrs old, and that little girl was practicing to be Danica Patrick.  It's not safe at all.  I heard the mom say that kid's name about 500 times.  Honey, I'm pretty sure the kid tuned you out after about #6.  As my mother would say, "Crimeny!"  She would also say some other things that would keep us from running around the store like wild animals.  Ah the times have changed.    Anyway, this store always has what I'm looking for and then some, and the employees are top notch.  Always smiling, friendly, and helpful, as they should be.  For me, it's worth the drive and dodging the kiddie carts.

I love this store, and the only thing I wanted to add is that when it gets cold outside, I go in and stock up on the chicken pot pies ($3.79 each), the steak and ale pies ($6.49 for two), and now I see they have a chicken curry pie ($5.99 for two).  Oh yeah.  Those and some good brown beer will keep us warm in the short Arizona winters.  Please build one in south Chandler.  Alma School & Queen Creek would be nice in that big plaza that has the Shoppers now.  Alma School and Ray would be even better.  Take over that dim sum place that closed.  See?  I already did the location scouting for you!  If you build it, they will come.

There are a few times I wish I could give more than 5 stars, and this is one of them.  I can't believe I waited so long to give Tott's a try.  Just a little background on my experience with Chinese food.  My mother was not a great cook and the only time we had anything even remotely resembling Chinese food was when she would crack open a can of that LaChoy Chow Mein.  It.  Was.  Awful.  I had to wait until I was in college to get some good Chinese food and a friend took me to Yen Ching's in Waterloo, IA and set me up with sweet and sour chicken and mongolian beef.  Ever since then I've had a serious love affair with mongolian beef, and I'll get sweet and sour chicken if a restaurant does it up with the peppers, onions, and pineapple.  I've discovered over the years that very few places do that any more.  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers and their pictures, I can see that Tott's does it correctly.  Right away I was greeted by the employees, and the dude who took my order was very friendly and helpful.  I ordered my lunch to dine in, and then an order of pork lo mein to go, to take home for my husband.    The restaurant isn't very big, but it's organized well and very clean.  My order of cheese puffs was so nice and light and the sweet & sour chicken was perfect.  I loved that the owner came around and introduced himself and when I told him I like how they prepared my lunch he said, "Isn't that the way everyone does it?"  Nope.  Absolutely not.    The chicken was lightly breaded and fried and the flavors with the sweet & sour sauce and peppers, onions, and pineapple were delicious.  It tasted like they use a good quality sweet & sour sauce too.  Usually the sauces at most places are very syrupy and sugary, almost like someone did a Red Bull reduction, and I usually get heartburn after eating them.  Not in this case.  The sauce was nicely balanced and so far no heartburn.  With the cheese puffs, a fountain soda, the sweet & sour chicken, and the lo mein my total was $20.27 before tax & tip.  Excellent experience all around.  This is food and customer service as good as it gets for sure!  Can't wait to go back!

The day after Christmas, Mr. M and I met up with Tim S. to give Cibo a try.  We got there a little early to get a table and right away I was taken with how the restaurant looks as we walked up to it.  With all the white lights, outdoor seating, and the pretty bungalow, it felt very welcoming and a much appreciated respite from the typical strip mall setting.    We were greeted and seated right away by the host, and our server, Jessica, was there right away to take our drink and app orders.  Since it was still happy hour I took advantage of those great deals and ordered the Straccetti ($4) and the Polpette ($6).  We also ordered a glass of house red, which I think is a montepulciano, or maybe a sangiovese...I don't know.  Both are fun to say and it was only four bucks.  Those apps are both 5 star!  I aspire to make a meatball that good.  Flavorful, moist, and accompanied by a nice red sauce and some crusty bread.  The Straccetti are completely addictive and I highly recommend those as well.  The little touches of fresh basil ribbons and slivers of fresh parmigiano just made that one even more perfect.  I would order both of those again anytime.  Delicious!  My husband ordered the calzone and I thought, for almost 15 bucks, that better be one damn good calzone, and it was!  Absolutely excellent blending of flavors and it's huge.  It made for some great leftovers the next day.  The best item we ordered.    Tim and I decided to order 2 pizzas to share and the pizza margherita disappeared in a hurry.  Simple, and perfectly done.  Now, the pizza rustica on the other hand was better as leftovers because it was underdone when it was brought to us.  I am familiar with the fork and knife style of pizza, but as I tried to take a slice of this one, the crust just kind of smeared across the pan and was almost gooey even though it was very thin.  The prosciutto was good quality, but because it was underdone as well, its flavors really didn't come alive.  An edge of crust was burnt, which is fine if the rest of the pizza is done, but the middle and the overall pizza was not completely finished.    I warmed it up the next day in a hot oven on a stone, and then it still had that chewy crust consistency, but the great flavor of the prosciutto was there.  The arugula was wonderful.  Fresh and peppery as it should be.  They were extremely busy, which was expected, and I think they took that one out of the oven just a minute or two too soon.  No complaints, but it was noticeable that it was undercooked.  I am a big fan of leftovers so it was not a big deal.    Jessica took good care of us and we had a great time.  I would most definitely make a return trip to Cibo.

Instead of exchanging gifts this year, Mr. M and I decided to go out and visit some businesses we've been wanting to and treat ourselves that way.  The day after Christmas we had a great lunch at Tim Finnegan's, and then I surprised him with a visit to Magnum's.  I had a feeling he would like this place.  Right away when we walked in, there was a very friendly and helpful young man working the cash register on the store side.  He explained the layout of the place and then told us he was available for any questions.  You can buy bottled whiskeys of all kinds of varieties, Scotch, bourbons, Irish whiskys, other hard liquors, wines, cigars (in a large walk-in humidor), and then they have a long row of coolers that contain a fantastic selection of craft beer.  If you've ever ogled the coolers at Papago, this is comparable.  I was also struck by the nice aroma of fine tobacco.  It wasn't smoky at all, just smelled very pleasant.    While Mr. M picked out a cigar I went in to check out the bar and find a seat.  They have a beautifully designed bar with lighted shelving behind, low lighting, and nice wood furniture.  I felt very comfortable immediately.  The bartender offered me the drink menu right away.  We usually lean towards trying some bourbons and when I mentioned that we'd never tried Four Roses before, he said that they make a special version just for them called Four Roses Magnum.  Well, heck yeah....let's give that a try.  We both enjoyed that very much and then I had some Eagle Rare 10 yr while Mr. M tried the Blantons 15 yr.  Initially he had ordered the Bulleit 10-yr, which was on the menu, and the bartender came back and said they must be out, but then said "Isn't that regular Bulleit?"  No it's not.  We have the economy size of regular Bulleit in our booze cabinet at home.  When I mentioned that the menu specifies 10-yr he got pretty condescending and made a comment that "most bourbon is 10 years old".    Whatever, Chief.  I'm not going to argue with you.  Bulleit 10-year is different from regular Bulleit.    The place started to fill up as the afternoon went on and there were a couple of large tables of guys really keeping the bartenders hopping.  We had 2 different bartenders who checked on us to make sure we were doing ok.  We didn't need to eat anything, but I asked if people were allowed to bring in outside food, and one of the bartenders told me that they have some menus for places that will deliver if anyone wants food.    Another couple came in and sat at the bar and we had a nice conversation about bourbon and other tasty beverages.  All in all we had a very nice time and it's probably a good thing for us they are something like 40 miles away from our house.  Definitely a spot worth checking out even if you are not a cigar smoker.

The food should get 4 stars, but having a dirty table on 2 visits in a row equals one or two stars in my book.  If the table is dirty, you wonder about overall cleanliness, but I do have a theory.  My theory is the servers bus their own tables.  That happens in a lot of places, but T.C. gets pretty darn busy, and in the quest to turn those tables quickly and get more tip money, I think corners are being cut.  On both visits I was greeted with a smile and quickly seated.  As I prepared to order the first time I moved my water glass and noticed a big splotch of hot sauce that had dried on the table.  I chuckled considering the strategic placement of the glass to hide it.  Someone did that on purpose.  I ordered the Crack O'Dawn which was a hearty blend of potatoes, ham, onion, shrooms, melted cheese, and eggs.  The kind of breakfast our forefathers ate before going out to work the fields.  Me, I was just getting sustenance for my drive to Deer Valley.  On the second visit I sat down and almost put my book in a big spot of pancake syrup that was on the table.  That one pissed me off.  Any server worth their salt knows that if any patron had any item at the table that required syrup, they got it on the table.  Lazy job of cleaning it between customers.  That time I ordered the Farmer's Market Ben E. Dict because I was experiencing carnivore guilt.  The toasted English muffin was layered with spinach, tomatoes, eggs, and avocado.  Really enjoyed that one as well.    Overall the food is good.  If you have Midwestern family members or friends visiting, they would most likely love this joint.  I am concerned about the cleanliness though.  I'm going to have to think about going back a third time.  It's not high on my list.

As indicated in my previous review this place wasn't high on my list to return to, but we were going right by there and I've never had an issue with the food, so why not.  Well, yet again, the table was sticky.  We watched our server and the owner push two dirty tables together for an 8-top, remove all the dirty plates, glasses, etc, and not wipe the table down.  Then, after the couple next to me left, the server cleaned off the dirty dishes and gave a cursory wipe of one corner with a rag.  The owner comes along to seat the next guests, notices the water ring on the table, wipes his right hand through it, and then spins to shake the hand of the next guest.    I'm in the dirty table Twilight Zone.  And this time because our server was busy bussing tables, our food came out lukewarm, and Mr. M's yolks were cool and had solidified under the heat lamp.    Hire.  Some.  Bussers.     I want to like this place, but now I know the tables are a petri dish.  Good luck.  I will not be back again.

From my prior tip, yes, we had a big fat Greek lunch here yesterday, and it was GREAT!  This is epic so brace yourselves.    This is the only BFGR location I've visited and we always have a great time.  I've taken Mr. M, I've taken a group of girlfriends, I've taken a group of coworkers and they've never let us down.   I'm still thinking about yesterday's lunch so that's what I'm going to write about.  We sat at the bar and each ordered a glass of retsina.  It took awhile for the wine to make its way to us.  Our server was very nice, but at one point she stopped by with two wine glasses and said, "I'll have so and so make your sangria because he does a better job."  I politely reminded her we had ordered 2 glasses of retsina, and she gave me kind of a blank look and said, "Oh, I don't know if we carry that anymore."  Uh....we had ordered it about 12 minutes and 47 seconds ago....  I happened to glance over at the wine/beer cooler and saw a yellow label that looked like it had Greek writing on it.  I asked her if that was it, and sheepishly, she said "Yes", and immediately poured us two healthy glasses of that wonderful wine.    Ah.  I'm happy.  Mr. M was Jonesin' for a gyro so that's what he ordered with the Greek fries.  I ordered one kebab of chicken souvlaki and one of the beef souvlaki with the Greek potatoes and a Greek side salad.    Everything was delicious.  We were passing the gyro back and forth.  It was overstuffed and had all the right flavors and plenty of gyro meat stuffed in that soft pita.  And the Greek fries....don't get me started.  Those are ridiculous with the feta cheese, seasoning, and sauce they drizzle over those.  I don't know what it is, but we OD'd on those for sure.  My kebabs had a wonderful smoky, grilled flavor, the chicken was tender and the steak was cooked a perfect med rare.  My roasted potatoes were nice and tender and I proceeded to stuff myself with even more potatoes.  Roasted taters + Greek fries = carbo overload.  My plate also came with some nice sautéed veggies, squash, broccoli, carrots, onion.  Very tasty.  The salad that started the meal was crisp and full of wonderful Greek flavor as well.    All in all we quite happily made complete pigs out of ourselves.  Everything was delicious, and after the slow start with the service, it was great after that, and a couple of other manager/owner types checked on us too.  I love that.  Then....oh yes there's more....we had just pushed back our chairs, were rubbing our full bellies, and here comes another owner/manager type offering us a sample of the new type of roasted potato they are going to offer.    Oh Lordy.  I am wondering what kind of carb coma I'm going to end up in, but we tried them and they were delicious.  They created a sauce that blends the best of oregano, lemon, and I think white wine and I even think I spied a caper.  Wonderful.    I want to go back today.

I'll go 4.5/5 for this one.  I've eaten BBQ all over the country, and I can't say Bobby Q is "as good as it gets", but they are pretty darn good.  Almost 3 weeks ago Mr. M and I met up with Tim S. and his family to give this place a try.    Right away I was impressed with the friendly service, and the hostess was helpful when we needed to add a high chair to the table.  Our server was Kanisha and she did a great job and was on point with taking our orders, making sure our drinks weren't empty, and bringing us togo boxes and the check when we were ready.    We wanted to be able to try a wide variety of items so we started with the Q-rolls ($10.50), which are absolutely delicious.  Brisket wrapped up like an egg roll?  Heck yeah!  Those disappeared quickly.  We also started with their house beer, which if memory serves is an amber ale and that was a nice, easy to drink beer.  Really enjoyed that as well.  The smaller one is $4.95 and the larger one is $6.00, so the moral of that story is, go for the big one!  I ordered the BBQ chicken/prime rib combo ($34) which came with 3 sides.  I chose the loaded baked potato, mac & cheese, and the ranch beans.  Mr. M ordered the 3 meat combo ($25) with pulled pork, brisket, and some ribs.    I thought I would waddle out of the joint stuffed to the gills, but we actually had so much fun talking that I didn't eat nearly as much as I thought I would.  Here's what I thought of the food:  Prime rib, chicken, and ribs:  Excellent!  Brisket: very good.  Pulled pork and ranch beans: really nothing going on there.  Very little flavor in the pork, and the beans tasted syrupy and had no BBQ flavor.  The other sides we had were very good.  I could OD on the mac & cheese.  Nicely done.  Lunch was pricey if you look at the receipt total of $93.63 after tax, before tip, but we had a lot of leftovers.  Overall we had a great experience and I would go back any time.

I love wandering around IKEA getting ideas for the house.  Rooms and furniture are set up in cool designs for the creatively challenged like me to just say, "I'll take that".  I could never come up with the decor ideas on my own.  Prices are generally very reasonable.  Just don't go near this place on a weekend.  It is insane.  Even though they have a child play area where you can leave your crumbsnatchers, there are kids running around everywhere and families of 15 will block the entire flow of traffic.  No way Jose am I ever going again on a weekend.

Cute restaurant with the bakery counters right up front to tempt me.  I didn't have any this time, but all the items on display looked delicious.  I had the Cuban for lunch with a side of the potato of the day.  The staff working the counters were all friendly and helpful, and I could also tell they were working hard to clean up the tables quickly after customers were finished.  The sandwich was not a traditional Cuban, but it was good.  The only complaint I have is the meat was all to one side and it was missing the roast pork.  It just had the ham.  I know.  I know.  How much pork is enough?  Well, I dig the pork.  It was like someone wasn't paying attention when they assembled the sandwich, because a third of it didn't have any meat at all.  Only pickle and mustard.  I tried to reassemble it, but it was nicely pressed together and if I would have tried to pull it apart, I would have done more damage.  My 2/3rds sandwich tasted good though.    The side of peppery mashed potatoes was very tasty.  I'm glad it was only an ice cream scoop-sized portion because I could have carbo O.D.'d on those if left to my own devices.  I would definitely go back if I was in the area again.  This time to get a cookie.  Or a Carmelita.  OH!  And I almost forgot.  Their policy about active parenting and well-behaved children makes me want to applaud!  I wish more places took a stand like that.  (Insert standing ovation here)

Oh wow...this place is really good!  I've been a couple of times now and I could go on and on (you know I could), but really, it's excellent almost all the way around. I've tried a few different things on the menu by this point, as you can see by my pictures, and everything has been delicious.  Their tabouli has to be some of the freshest I've ever had, and the meats are full of flavor.  The only reasons they don't get 5 stars are because the service is a little shaky at times, and the one time I got the chicken kabob, it was a pretty skimpy portion.  Other than that, I would go back any time.  They also have a Yelp check-in offer of 50% off your second entree, which is a great deal.  Their prices are reasonable anyway, even without a discount.

Normally I trade in my credit card points for more useful things like gas cards or statement credits, but a few months ago I traded in some and got 100 bucks in cards good at either Roy's or Flemings.  Then this past Wednesday it turned out that both Mr. M and I were dressed nicely at the same time (usually I'm working from home in my "Hoptimistic a cold beer is in my future" t-shirt and some old shorts), and we decided to go to Roy's.  I have eaten at several different Roy's, but it's been a few years, and my Mr. had never been to one.    We started with the surf and turf app from the Chef's Selection menu and this was absolutely delicious.  Two grilled shrimp, cooked perfectly and slightly smoky.  Then there was a 3-4 oz. bacon-wrapped filet on top of a light potato puree.  Oh my.  If we go back anytime soon, I want one of those all to myself.  That disappeared very quickly.    We also ordered some cocktails and I had the Buffalo Trace Manhattan and he had the Rye Me a River.  Both very nice and well worth their 12 dollar price tag, but remind me to hit their happy hour sometime so I can afford to eat and drink here more often.  Then for our entrees my husband ordered the Himalayan sea salt ribeye off of the Chef's Selection menu and I ordered the Roy's Trio, which our server offered to make into a quad with the addition of the Ahi for $3.95.  Heck yeah!     We had decided not to take our phones in, and just talk and have a nice meal so I don't have any pictures of the main meal, but suffice it to say, it was all perfect.  The way they prepare the fish here is just amazing to me.  The ahi and the butterfish are so light they melt in your mouth, and the macadamia crusted mahi and salmon are so flavorful.  We also really enjoyed sharing the ribeye which was cooked to a perfect medium rare.    Our server, Anthony, was the most gracious host and when I mentioned we were sharing our food he brought a couple of clean plates right away so we could pass bites across the table, and was very prompt with drink refills.    We don't usually order dessert, and were too full to have the chocolate soufflé or the pineapple upside down cake while we were there, but I thought it would be nice to take something home for later.  On the specials menu they had carrot cake listed and that always sounds appealing so I ordered a piece to go.  When I asked Anthony if they put whipped cream or anything on it, he said "yeah, they put all kinds of cream and mango or pineapple something on it....."  I asked him if we could just get it plain and he said, "Sure."  He got it all boxed up to go and put it in a bag to carry out.    When the bill came it was $140.21 before tip, as expected, so I was really glad I had the gift cards.  The only disappointment came when we got home, and I totally take the blame for this.    When I got home I decided to take a look at the carrot cake and was totally shocked I paid 9 bucks for 2- inch and a half square pieces of plain carrot cake.  See picture.  Nothing else.  No cream cheese frosting.  No nothing.  Ah I should have known.  A great deal of enjoying a meal at Roy's is the presentation.  I'm sure they take these 2 little squares and really doll them up.  9 bucks.  4 bites of cake.  Well, live and learn.  Next time I'll ask more questions or look in the box before I take it out of the restaurant.  Overall, I would definitely go back to Roy's sooner rather than later.

Mr. M and I spent New Year's Eve here for a couple of reasons.  A.  It's 1.8 miles from North Mountain Brewing, and B.  I generally patronize properties in the Hilton family.    I want to come back and stay longer because a few days of walking up and down those hills will get my lazy beer-drinking, pizza-eating ass in shape.  This place is no joke!  Up and down and up and down and most of it seems like UP pretty steep hills, but I liked it.  The setting is really beautiful.  I think I saw they have 6 pools.  We didn't take advantage of any of the pools, whirlpools, or the workout center, but we did enjoy walking all over the grounds the morning of the 1st.    They will shuttle you around if you need it, but get some exercise!  Speaking of shuttles, our new buddy, Mike is a rock star.  I called the concierge desk on New Year's Eve to inquire about a ride to North Mountain Brewing, thinking we might have to call a cab, and he said he'd take us and pick us up.  But just in case he was busy for the return trip, he gave us a card for a car service as well.  He was really fun to talk to and I almost wish the drive would have been more than 1.8 miles.  And as promised, after we called him, he was there in 10 minutes to take us back.  He is an absolute asset to the resort.    I had splurged because not only was it NYE, it was Mr. M's birthday, so reserved one of the signature suites.  Oh good Lord....I wish I could stay in rooms like this when I travel instead of Hampton Inns with everything crammed into one room.  The Signature suites are almost 1300 square feet, have a large living room, fireplace, dining area, separate bar area, 2 bathrooms, 5 sinks, 2 big TVs, a big bedroom with balcony, a separate seating area between the bed and bathroom, and a really crappy Motel 6-esque shower.  That shower was the only negative.  It took 15 minutes of wasting water to get hot water, and it's just kinda small and yucky overall.  Not what I would expect in a resort.  Everything else was great.  We didn't get to use the fireplace because it was a No Burn day, but that would have been very cozy if we could have.    The bed was very comfortable and everything was very clean.  We had a nice breakfast at Point in Thyme the next morning.  Overall I would definitely come back for a longer stay and do some hiking and explore this part of the city.

Oh I really dig this joint vs. the huge stores like Bass Pro Shops.  Every time we've been in here the staff has been super friendly and helpful and answers all my dumb questions.    I think I want to go camping, but I had no idea where to start so I bought a water bottle holder and some socks.  I'll have to make a list and go back for the rest of the goods.    I usually lose track of Mr. M and he's off looking at ammunition and touching all the guns and crossbows.  This store makes me want to hit the trails every weekend and really explore more remote parts of Arizona.  They have everything I think you could ever need and a wide range of price choices.  They also have handbooks that will help me prepare for camping and hiking.  Sportsman's Warehouse is definitely one of our favorite places to shop in the city.

Firebirds is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants.  I've been to several and always have a good to great experience.  Back on April 25th Mr. M and I stopped in to see if we could sit in the bar and watch some baseball, and it worked out really well.  They have some long tables that face the bar and there was a TV right in front of us with the Cardinals game on.    We started with the Coconut Shrimp appetizer, which was light and delicious and disappeared in about 30 seconds.  Then we ordered the crab cake salad and baby back ribs entrée to share.  Our server, Samantha, was absolutely great.  She was on point with drink orders and refills, and when our baby backs arrived, the meal had been split perfectly into 2 plates.  The greens for the salad were nice and fresh and I always enjoy their crab cakes, which are full of crab and cooked perfectly.  The ribs were so tender and delicious with their slightly sweet sauce and mild smoky flavor.    We each had a 5-dollar HH glass of wine, and then shared a 5-dollar HH Belvedere martini.  All in all a perfect dinner!

Yep.  Firebirds is still my favorite chain restaurant.  Mr. M's bday is New Year's Eve and normally I plan something really fun and we go all out, maybe get a suite at one of those swanky joints in Scottsdale, or go to Vegas, or go to Mill Ave and party til 2 a.m., but in 2014 we had a big wonderful trip to Germany and then we were talking about finally buying a house here.  We didn't want to go too crazy and drop a lot of cash so he chose Firebirds for his bday dinner.  (This year he turns 50 so you know it's going to be a party.  I need to start planning that one now).    We are already like a couple of old farts and arrived at the restaurant a little before 5:00.  Started with the coconut shrimp app, which is always good and since it was his birthday I didn't sneak more than my fair share like I usually do.  I was in a burger kind of mood and just kept it simple with a bacon cheeseburger and some of that tortilla slaw they do that is so tasty.  He ordered the 14 oz. aged ribeye medium rare, and that steak was perfect.  Perfect.  And one more ... perfect.  Absolutely the best steak I've had in a long long time.  UH, I mean we or he had.  I tried to just leave the birthday steak alone, but I think after awhile I was giving him the Puss N Boots big eyes and he would pass me a few bites.  Wonderful meal!  We ordered a bottle of Malbec and did you know if there's any left they will recork it and you can take it home?  I didn't know that.  There wasn't any left, but good to know for future reference.  Our server was ok, but kind of unmemorable.  He seemed kind of distracted.  Not bad.  Not great.  The manager came around to see how we were doing.  I always appreciate that.    We made it out of there for under a hundred bucks and had a fantastic meal.  Always enjoy Firebirds.

I still love Firebirds.  Recently I bought some gift certificate deal that was buy $100, get $20 or something like that, so we've been over here a lot.  I love the happy hour deals.  I love the early bird dinners, Mon-Thurs, 4-6.  You get a choice of 3 salads and 6 or 7 entrees for $14.95.  Can't beat it.  And I love one of those pomegranate HH cocktails for 5 bucks....Perfect!  The two bartenders that have been working lately are awesome too.  One guy, one gal, and they are really friendly without hovering and do a great job.  I start even thinking about Firebirds and we are going.  That.  Is.  It.

I've probably shopped here 10 times in the last 2 years and have always had great service and I really enjoy the selection of women's running and beer-drinking, uh....I mean, yoga clothes.  If I have a return or exchange it's always been taken care of quickly and with a smile.  No complaints.

There was a day a couple weeks ago that suddenly, I woke up and wanted to explore east Mesa and Apache Junction.  Why?  I have no idea.  But I am glad I found Rudy's.  Based on the yelp reviews I tried the carne asada burrito which was stuffed full of tender meat and rice, beans, and lettuce.  And also I am very susceptible to ads painted on windows, so I tried an order of the beef taquitos.  The taquitos were light and crispy on the outside and full of tender beef.  So tender I had to tell myself to "Chew your food, you savage."    The young woman working at the front counter was friendly and happy to answer a couple of questions I had.  I look forward to hitting this joint again, either before or after some hiking at Lost Dutchman State Park.

I love Bookman's.    I can clean off my bookshelves and save my magazines and get some store credit to spend on more books and magazines.  I love the random collection of items to be found here as well.  Everything from comic books to albums to CDs to movies to games to jewelry to books, books, and more books.    It's a good thing I don't live closer or I'd have some serious 'splainin' to do.

Nope.  Newp.  Nah.  No way.  Never again for this location.  We have always patronized the one on south Arizona Ave & Ocotillo, but since we moved north of the 202, we thought we'd give this Zipps a try and watch some football last night.  They have plenty of TVs and we had no problem watching our game.  I'll just break it down to what was good and what was bad.  The good:  our server, Mandy, is 5-star.  She was super nice and helpful, and did the best with what the kitchen gave her to work with.  We also enjoyed the cold pitcher of Alaskan Amber ($12.50) , the pepper jack focaccia ($8.95), and the fish taco ($7.25), which is more like a fish burrito, but those 2 food items were good.  The bad:  We ordered mild golden wings and are pretty sure we got medium regular wings.  We powered through them because we had a pitcher of beer at hand, but they were not correct.  We both used to work in kitchens and try to never send food back.  The onion rings that I used to rave about were awful.  Old, greasy, and floppy.  Just not good at all.  My husband's fish taco came with chips and salsa which were just generic, nothing special, until he got through the 5 or 6 whole chips on top, and underneath those were the chip crumbs from the bottom of the bag.  The person who poured those chips just flat out doesn't care.  Just that simple.  You can't dip crumbs into salsa.  (No shit, Sherlock, right?)   To wind it down and get through the 4th quarter we each ordered a Dewars and water.   Those were both water with a hint, a splash, a sprinkling, a wisp, a shadow, a tuft, a shred, a snippet, a twist...  a modicum, a ghost, a bit, a dab, a dribble, a touch, a mite, a smidgen, a nip, a teeny tiny amount...  a dash, a dinky, dwarfish, puny, shrimpish, undersized, runtish, infinitesimal, wee, sparse, deficient, inadequate amount of Dewars.  $6.75 each.  Total rip off.    Like I said, nope.  Never again.

I have to give a 5-star shout out to this store.  If you like HomeGoods like I like HomeGoods you know it can be a great place to find nice things you need sometimes, and it can also be a fun place to blow your money on things you don't need.  This store is always clean and well-organized and the main reason for my 5-star review is that the employees are always friendly and have a smile on their face.  No matter what.  That Fulton Ranch crew can be obnoxious sometimes and I'm sure the employees' patience is tested almost daily.  Today for example, I heard Ms. Lululemon and Ms. Gucci telling a cashier to just "make up a price" for something they grabbed that didn't have a UPC sticker on it.  Sure lady.  Just for you.  Take a hike.  Go get in your badly-parked Porsche and get out of here.  I love looking for deals on higher end cookware like Emile Henry and Calphalon and can almost always find something at a great price that I can use in the kitchen.  I am challenged when it comes to décor around the house, and I always get great ideas here as well.    This parking lot is still one of the worst I've ever navigated, so watch yourself when you're here.  Or, if you drive a luxury car/bloated SUV, just floor it, and everyone else will get out of your way.  Happy shopping!!

LOVE the Crazy Cranberry!  The shop is always clean and I'm greeted with a smile.  Someday I intend to try another flavor, but for now it's Crazy Cranberry all the way.

Usually I patronize greasy spoon take-out Chinese places with smeared windows, but it was a real treat to find Dragon Wok.  It feels nice to go in feeling clean and come out full and still feeling clean, unlike some other establishments I've been in.  We always do lunch because I don't like paying nighttime Chinese food prices.  Seems like they double at night and then I spend way more on booze and end up $100 poorer, only to end up hungry again a half hour later.  The food at Dragon Wok is always fresh.  I feel like they may have just made those potstickers I was served from scratch.  And they make Mongolian Beef just the way I like it:  nice brown sauce, tender beef, lots of green onions, and a few fresh mushrooms.  Perfect.   The service is always friendly and fast, but not too fast.  I've never felt rushed here, unlike some other places where they drop the check with the food and say, "No hurry, I'll be your cashier when you're ready", which really means "Throw your cash on the table and gtfo so I can turn this baby and get more tip."   I like that the owners are walking around making sure everyone is happy and they will help a server when they need to.  I hear a lot of laughter here too which means happy customers.  Always a pleasure dining at Dragon Wok.

Really friendly employees and delicious cheesesteaks will keep me coming back, but definitely at off peak times.  We ate there for the first time today and it was so crowded and noisy.  When they were clacking those spatulas on the grill to chop the meat I thought my head was going to explode.  I don't expect the library by any means, but the grill is right out in the dining area and that loud repetitive metal on metal was just too much for me.  There were times we couldn't even carry on a conversation.  If I'm going to be somewhere that loud, there better be some booze available.  We took one of the two-tops just over the wall from the ordering line, and there was some broad next to us with her legs crossed, one of those drumsticks hanging out where people were trying to walk, oblivious.  I got bumped into several times while people tried to avoid her taking up almost the entire space between tables.  She should have hidden those gnarly toes anyway.    Walking through that door I truly felt like I had stepped out to the East Coast.  Philly décor all over the walls.  Every time I see a picture of Chase Utley I always think of the It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episode when the gang goes to Atlantic City.  One of the best.    No!  YES!!   You have to see it if you haven't.  Hilarious.  Season 6.  Episode 11.    There were several people waiting for a table when our sandwiches were ready, so we just took them to go and hit up a nearby park to enjoy the weather.  The cheesesteaks were absolutely the best I've had in a long time.  Delicious, tender, well-seasoned meat with a super soft, fresh hoagie roll.  We didn't get the fries this time, but when we were in the restaurant I saw some walk by and they looked good as well.  No pics this time, but we'll definitely be going back.

5 stars for the friendly service and the chicken with garlic and cilantro entrée.  This is my favorite craving lately, even more so because I've had a horrible cold, and this dish makes me feel so much better.  When I stopped in yesterday I also had some of the chicken lemon rice soup, which was the epitome of comfort food.  I'm surprised I'm not cured by now!  But, I'm definitely on the mend.  I wish I lived closer to either location because I would eat here weekly for sure.  Someday I'll actually try a kabob or a gyro, but for now it's the garlic and cilantro chicken dish all the way.  The flavors blend together so well, and the last time I had this dish, I put the leftovers in the back of the fridge for a couple of days, and it got even better!  Highly recommend.  It may seem a little steep at $15.99 to others, but the quality is definitely first rate, and I can get 3 meals out of it.

We live about a 30 second drive from Grimaldi's, but I would still come here to eat great pizza even if it was a 30-minute drive.  Usually we get it to go, but the times we have eaten in the restaurant it has been a nice relaxing experience.  They have a great wine selection and one night I commented on a wine I really liked and the waiter was happy to show me the bottle so I could look for it the next time I was at BevMo.    We usually start with the antipasti which is so good I keep saying I'm going to go back sometime and get the large antipasti order and just have that with a couple of glasses of wine.    Our standard order is the large pesto with sausage and mushrooms and the large calzone with meatballs.  Those two items are so good we haven't tried much of anything else.  Yes, it's a little pricey, but compared to what?  The national chains?  I read somewhere that Domino's food costs per pizza are just over $2.  I'd rather pay more for quality and fresh ingredients.  Not just cheap pizza to soak up the beer in my belly.    And that pesto pizza warmed up in the oven the next morning with a fried egg on top is wonderful!  I highly recommend trying that.

I've decided I live in a Bermuda Triangle of poor customer service.  This Office Max is no exception.  Good luck finding someone to help you.  It's either deserted, or there is one employee up front handling phone calls and ringing up customers.    I had to get my own office chair and drag the box up to the front.  I had to be all passive aggressive, which is totally against my direct nature, to get some assistance earlier this week on locating something.    On that same visit there was one young gal up front, who was very friendly, but she was doing all the work.  Answering phone calls, placing people on hold to research their question, and ringing up customers.  I did see another female employee hanging out in the copy/print area doing I don't know what.  Counting ceiling tiles.  Napping.  Whatever.  I'm done done doneski with this place.  One star is for the store being clean and the other is for the fact that they usually have what I'm looking for.    I have been to the Office Max in Ahwatukee and those employees always have a smile on their face and are always helpful.  That's going to be my choice for Office Max from now on.

Hey!  I haven't been to a buffet in a couple of years.  I would say the last time was the holiday buffet at Verona Chophouse a few Christmases ago.  But on Sunday I had a wild hair to try some place different that also had seafood on the menu.  Well, do they have seafood?  A lot!  Mr. M and I made a couple of trips and tried little bits of all kinds of things, and I think we still didn't even taste half of the offerings.  Everything was really good, from the little stuffed shrimp to the sautéed bok choy to the chicken wings to the donuts to the soup to the dumplings.  Oh yeah!  And neither of us eat sushi or sashimi, but if a person does I could see this being such a great deal.    Sunday's prices are something like $16.88/person all day and it was well worth it.  I also had a coupon and had printed the incorrect $1 off per person for lunch, and our waitress, Latanya, gave us the $1.50 off dinner coupon.  She was great even though they were still fairly busy around 1:30.  Very friendly and always smiling, she kept our drinks filled and took care of several other tables.    Next time I'll take pictures.  This isn't your average buffet.  Everything tasted very fresh and there was so much variety.  I look forward to a return visit and would definitely take friends or family who are visiting if I didn't feel like cooking at home and trashing the kitchen.

Old school style butcher shop that has great service and a great selection.  You will pay more, but you can sign up for their emails and get the monthly and weekend specials.  Often there are coupons for BOGO or a few bucks off your purchase.  They also have a good selection of beer and wine, side dishes, and some supplies for home BBQ and smoking.  After reading the other reviews, I know my hubby and I need to try the jerky.  We always enjoy shopping at Von Hanson's.

You know what costs nothing?  To say to your customers, "Hey.  How ya doin?  I'll be right with you" or  "Good morning" or "Thank you".   Or...get this...flash them the occasional smile.    Mr. M and I have been in here every couple of months for almost 5 years because we love their products and are willing to pay extra for them.  And they have a great beer and wine selection, and a good variety of wood for an afternoon BBQ.  And when I used to have a weekday off I could go in and there were usually a couple of older guys working who are so nice and I'd feel like I was truly in an old school butcher shop.  It was really a pleasure to shop there.  But the last couple of years there has been a huge turnover in employees.  Almost every time I go in there are different people working.  No smiles.  No greeting.    The manager will either be talking on the phone taking care of business, or, like today, behind the counter stuffing peppers, not interacting with customers.  I remember one time I came in and she was working, finished a phone call, looked right at me, walked in the back, came back out and talked to an employee, and nobody said boo.  It's just annoying.  Especially when this store is a niche with high prices.    Today there were a couple of customers ordering items from the counter and my husband and I went in to get some seasoning and some brats out of the coolers.  We got what we needed and went to the register.  When one of the employees finished getting items for a customer from the counter, she walked over in front of us and rang him up.  Fine.  He and his fussy kid can get on down the road.  Then the next employee comes over and puts the stuff for his customer that he was helping, next to ours on the counter, and I'm thinking, "What in the heck do I need to do to get rung up here?  Go order some jerky?"  So we did.  I asked the guy behind the counter if customers ordering things from them take precedence from the self-serve people and he said, "I just put that stuff on the counter.  If you're in line you're in line."    OK.  Well thank you, Captain Obvious.  I've been standing in line for awhile now.    All the while the manager is standing there with her back to the store, stuffing peppers.    I probably sound a little petulant, and I'm at peace with that.  My beef is with the lack of friendly customer service.  I don't have to shop here and I'm really in no hurry to go back.  It's very disappointing.

So when I get up on Saturday mornings I make sure my husband has started on the mile-long honey-do list I've left him, and I shake my finger at him and then say, "No Bud Light until you're finished with that list, Mister," and then I pile on a gallon of some Jessica Simpson designer imposter perfume, put on my yoga pants, a push-up bra, my most over-priced tank top, and grab my squalling 16-month-old to go meet up with my best girl, Traycee, and shop at Nordstrom Rack.  We drag my kid, Barrington, all over the store, and he's screaming the whole way, but really, who cares?  Then we head to Juan Jaime's for half a bottle of tequila and a couple of tortilla chips, and Barrington is still screaming, but again, who cares?  I  had a great time and jacked the credit card up six- or eight-hundred dollars.  I forget, but I don't pay the bill so whatever.    Man.  There is a whole other world out there, and I'm glad I don't live in it.  But sadly, sometimes I catch the effects of it.  I am so glad we finally tried Juan Jaime's.  Ladena has always been our server, and she is awesome.  She makes sure those drinks don't get empty and is quick with the food and the check as well.    I have a new love.  It's their pomegranate margarita.  Delicious!  Right now I can't feel my elbows or my kneecaps and I'm pretty sure I only weigh 110 pounds.  That's a great drink!  We've also had the street dog lunch special, the carnitas and beef tacos, the nachos, and the cheese enchiladas.  Everything is tasty and reasonably priced.    Next time we'll have to try the patio where we can then be entertained by all the bad drivers on Chandler Blvd.  GREAT place!

It's a sad state of affairs when my husband and I are driving around looking for homes for sale within walking distance of Fibber Magees.  We like the place that much.  We went again today and ordered the mussels, which always make me blaspheme with pleasure they are so good.  They are on par with fresh mussels I've had on the coasts.  Just amazing.  And the broth is bacony and oniony and peppery.  They give you one slice of very good garlic bread per order, which is really not enough.  That order should come with two pieces so I don't have to pay a buck for another one or start dipping things like french fries and tacos in that wonderful broth.  One of these days I'm going to ask Kevin to hook me up with a dirty martini with about a 1/2 shot of that broth.  We typically get the fish and chips, which have always been perfect, but today for some reason I tried something different.  I had the pork tacos app for my meal and it came with four fat stuffed little soft shells with some tasty tomatillo salsa and pico de gallo.  Tender pork and flavorful salsa.  My belly was very happy.  I topped that with a Newcastle, and then was feeling frisky so I asked Kevin for one of those Three Olives Froot Loop drinks.  Great dessert.  Trust me.  The Baileys Bread and Butter Pudding is a stellar dessert choice as well.    Mr. M had the cod sandwich and it was fried perfectly, as the fish always has been there.  It may seem simple to some, but there's really an art to cooking fish.  It doesn't take much to overcook it and whoever is frying it up back in Fibber's kitchen knows what they are doing.   I don't usually eat a lot of fries but theirs are like crack for me because they are skinny and brown and salty.  Mmmmmm mmm mmm.  And I will say a few of them got dipped in that mussels broth and that was delicious.   So my only simple request, with eyes wide open like Puss In Boots in the Shrek movies, is to add a second piece of garlic bread to the mussels order.  Maybe do only one when it's half off during happy hour, but faith n' begorrah, one just isn't enough!!

I haven't updated my review in almost 2 years?  Well, that's crazy.  My husband and I still drive around this neighborhood looking for places to live that are between Fibbers and Cornish Pasty.  What a perfect world that could be!    Well, I'm glad I leave a little pile of receipts next to the computer so I'm reminded to write reviews.  This one is easy.    Go get the meatloaf sandwich and some Jameson.  They will change your life.

I've been to this BevMo! more times than I would like to admit in the past 3 years.  After visiting the BevMo! at Tempe Marketplace 3 or 4 times when I was in that area, and getting 3000% better customer service and friendly employees, I have decided to switch my loyalty to that location.    We stopped in to this one for the last time a few days ago and the couple of employees out on the floor were more intent on stocking shelves than saying "howdy" to customers, or making sure there was room for customers to get by.  I wanted to say, "Don't you hate it when those darn customers get in the way???"  The young man who rang us up appeared to be new there and seemed to be flabbergasted at our collection of booze and got the giggles.  Weird.  Dude, if you're going to work at a large liquor store, you're going to see some things.  I subscribe to All About Beer, Draft, and Whisky Advocate.  We mean business when we go to the liquor store.  I've never used the term "Meh" until now.  Meh.  I'll go where my cartful of craft beers and tequila and bourbon and Irish whisky is greeted and thanked with a smile.

One of our favorite places ever!  Always great quality food and service.  I like that there seems to always be a manager type who walks around checking to make sure customers are happy.    Love the burgers and the beers.  Really no need to go here for anything else, but they also have a very creative menu.  We haven't tried the brunch yet, but from the other comments, that sounds like a winner too.  Always a great time at San Tan.

Even though I love the burgers I decided to branch out and try something else today and man am I ever glad I did.  I ordered the Baja shrimp tacos which put my mouth in a world of happiness because of their great grilled flavor and that wonderful smoky chipotle crema.  Holy moley....can I have a jar of that for my eggs in the morning??!!  Really nice.  A little heat, but not too much, and the shredded cabbage was nice and fresh in the tacos.  Perfect for a hot afternoon.  Mr. M ordered the Smokehouse Pork Belly Burger, which made us both remember why Homer Simpson calls the pig a magical animal.  This is an amazing burger!  Smoked bacon ground with beef topped with some gouda and BBQ onions?  Are you kidding me?  Mouthwateringly delicious!  We had to try the Count Hopula and were not disappointed.  It made me think of a Guinness on hop steroids.  Nice.  Then I had to have a Pome-rita with my tacos and oh lordy....this is one of those drinks that goes down way too well with its Cabo Wabo Blanco.  Help me but I think I might have stuck a $5 bill in our server's pants.....He was wonderful.  The meal was wonderful.  Already looking forward to our next visit.

I have to come back and give these guys some love for their breakfast.  I think they've been serving breakfast for at least a couple of years now, and lately I've made it a priority to get over there and try them out.  On two visits we have had 4 different items: the 2 egg breakfast, the bacon and avocado omelet, the green eggs & ham benedict, and the big play breakfast.  Everything for the most part has been excellent, and what's even better, they have a Yelp check in offer of 20% off a breakfast entree.  Great deal.    Some things that are exceptional are the beer bread, so soft and totally addictive.  I could eat that stuff until I have to go lie down in the corner and take a nap.  The bacon.  THE BACON!  Delicious!  The creativity of the green eggs & ham benedict.  They make spinach hollandaise and use pork belly.  It's got a little heat and is completely delicious.  You have to try it to believe it.    And then those multigrain pancakes with pecan butter.  Absolutely fantastic.  My husband said those are the best pancakes he's ever had.  I'm still thinking about them.  The hash browns have always been good and crisp and the coffee is good and strong.  And don't even get me started on those beer cocktails.  If I get started on those, it will be one of those days where I end up at the casino, acting like Clark Griswold.   I can't say enough good things about breakfast at the brewery.  Can't wait to go back.

To conclude our day date on Sunday, after we left Fox Cigar Bar we went to Cantina Laredo for an early dinner.  I had eaten at the Scottsdale location twice last year for lunch and enjoyed it then, so I thought I would take the husband to the Gilbert location and see what happy hour and dinner was like.    We were greeted right away by a manager type and he seated us and said our server, I believe her name was Jackie, would be right with us, and she was.  She showed us the HH menu and we opted for the $5 marg.  They also have $3 HH margs, but we're no pansies and wanted the bigger one.  We also ordered some chicken taquitos that are on the HH menu.  We got 6 for $3.49.  I thought that was a great deal.   They were flavorful with a nice crunch and the chicken was very tender.  In fact, I'm going to daydream about those for a minute.  Then we decided to share the Asada Y Camarones which is, to quote the menu:  grilled steak topped with bacon-wrapped shrimp filled with oaxaca cheese and jalapeno.  For $23.99 it was a great price and portion to share.  We each felt like we had a full dinner.  The steak was tender with a little pink inside, just like we like it, and those bacon-wrapped shrimp were heavenly.  They had a smoky flavor already and then the bacon on top of that....well, bacon makes everything better.  Our dinner came with some rice and sauteed squash.  Both nice and light.    How could I forget the chips and salsa?  I love that they bring you two salsas and one is more fire-roasted tasting and a little spicier.  Like them both a lot.  I ended up putting the smoky, spicier one on those taquitos and was in my own little heaven.      Jackie was very attentive and overall we had a great experience and look forward to going back.

Irish pubs are really my favorite places to eat, drink, and be merry.  Last Friday we knew we were meeting Tim S. for dinner at Cibo, so why not leave the 'burbs and go try some other places I have bookmarked on Yelp and just make a day of it?    Tim Finnegan's was on the list and we had a great lunch.  We started with the mussels app which had some of the best broth I've ever had with mussels.  It was a little spicy, but not too much, and they put noodles in there which I've never seen before, but they soaked up the broth very nicely and made the meal more substantial.  I also really like the brown bread that came with it.    Mr. M ordered the lunch portion fish and chips and I ordered the Rasher burger.  You know the food is good when there is very little talking, just eating.  That's what we did for the next 20 minutes, passing bites of fish and burger across our plates to each other and sharing the fries and green beans.  All perfectly done all the way around.    The fish was nice and light with very tasty fries.  My burger was really exceptional and on par with the great burgers I've had at Fibber Magees and Skeptical Chymist.  Some of the best burgers I've had in this city were at places that don't market themselves as a burger joint.    With a pint of Kilkenny, Guinness, and sharing one of Harp, our total before tax and tip was $36.23.  They have a great Yelp check-in deal and you can get the appetizer for free if you purchase two entrees.      I loved the atmosphere with all the dark wood and small tables and booths.  Kristen took good care of us at the bar and we enjoyed her banter with some of the regular patrons.  I wish we lived closer to Tim Finnegan's, but now that we've given it a try, we'll be back for sure.

They have a sausage with fresh basil thin pizza on the app menu that is amazing.  I don't know what they do to it, but it's so damn good.  I've tried the champagne chicken salad which is good too, and Mr. M and I have shared the chicken and ribs entree which is a lot of food, so perfect to share, and we've enjoyed that too.  But we have a regular routine of swinging in here just for that pizza and a beer or a glass of wine.  We've always had great service in the bar area.  I like the dark wood and the booths are semi-private which is nice if you want to carry on a conversation.  The pizza is 5-stars and the wine gets 3-stars because they give a skimpy pour for the price.

This is generally my go-to Lowe's and for the most part I have no issues.  I've always been able to find what I need and the employees have been very friendly.    I only have had two issues.  Once in awhile the stacks of mulch will be full of broken, leaking bags making a huge mess in the area.  Does anyone check this?  Or do they think the customers will just grab partial bags and go?  I dunno, but I usually shove the partials aside and get full bags.  I'm strong and resourceful like that.  Then the other issue has nothing really to do with the store, but there are several stop signs out front and almost no one stops at them, so watch yourself as you walk from the parking area to the garden center.  People rarely stop there after they turn off Arizona and it can be like a good game of Frogger, only this time of year with walkers and oxygen tanks.

I like Sprouts, but I think I'm finished with this Sprouts.  Been shopping here two, sometimes 3 times a week for the past two years, and never had a 3, 4, or 5 star shopping experience.  There are 1 or 2 cashiers that are usually smiling.  Other than that, the employees are very unfriendly and I have to go seek out help if I have a question.  I don't really mind doing that if I really want something, but once, only once I asked for a couple of things from the meat counter and that employee was so unfriendly, I'll never make that mistake again.  I'll stuff my own chicken breasts, thank you.    And let me take 10 minutes to compose myself after laughing my butt off at the thought of getting any assistance in the supplement aisles.  That section has virtually no help.  I've seen employees standing in that general area.  I've seen one using the makeup samples to apply her face in the morning.  I've seen employees talking to each other in that general area, but not once have I been greeted.  I'm not shy, so I'll go ask for help if I need it, but I'm left unimpressed with the service in this area in particular.  Usually the employees are hard to find, or busy with their conversations with each other.    And like another yelper mentioned, the parking lot is probably one of the most dangerous I've ever been in.  It is not uncommon for me to witness people getting almost run over by one of those idiots who start their car in reverse and start wheeling out into the lot without a look.  I've seen this probably two times a month.  This shopping center also contains a HomeGoods, Stein Mart, and Tuesday Morning and there are many foaming-at-the-mouth women in the lot speeding around, intent on lighting up the credit card, so you have to be very very careful if you venture into this lot.    Anything else?   Well, their remodel was very nice, and I've never had a problem with the quality of items I've purchased here, but I think I'll be trying a different location from now on.

Since my last review I've only been in this store once or twice due to convenience.  After switching to the Ray/Dobson Sprouts, I would say it's one star better.  But this morning we were in the area and decided to jump into this one for a couple of things, and it's still the same ol' story with the employees.  No one will look me or my husband in the eye.  A few that were in the aisles just kept stocking shelves and ignoring customers.  It costs nothing to say, "Hey!  How are you?  Need any help?", but I have not found that here.  I was back by the freezers looking for something and a tall dude came out of the back with his Sprouts sweatshirt on, in a big hurry and almost ran me over.  Not a word.  Ridiculous.    When we got to the checkout lines, the cashier was somewhat friendly, but then she and the bagger stood there in front of us and complained about their schedule for the week and mentioned an employee by name "who always screws it up".   She was so busy complaining she messed up on her scanning and had to correct a few things.    Sometime check out the Sprouts Culture board that's on the wall at the front of the store.  Absolutely no mention of the customer.  Just something I noticed and find interesting.  This stuff bothers me because I want to really like Sprouts.  I would think working in a small, easily-navigable store that generally sells good products would be a good place to work.  I guess I have too high of expectations, growing up in the land of Hy-Vee "where there's a helpful smile in every aisle", and living in Florida where there are Publix grocery stores, which are AWESOME.  They actually act like they are happy to see their customers.  Can you believe that?    My experiences here tell me it comes from the top.  If management doesn't care, the employees certainly aren't going to care.  And just a side note, after my last review, I got a message from some passive aggressive douchebag who claimed a couple of times, to have "no association with the store" but somehow seemed to know an awful lot about that store and attempted to scold me.  Try that again, and I'll make it a public part of my review.  If that's the way to respond to unhappy customers, no wonder I receive the service I do there.

Since Spring Roll Factory closed several months ago, we've been thinking about trying to find a replacement that served delicious pork noodle bowls, and Pho Van does exactly that.  We stopped in yesterday for lunch and were greeted and seated right away.  I ordered a Vietnamese coffee and my husband ordered a Tsingtao.  We started with their egg rolls which are nicely done.  Fresh, flavorful ingredients on the inside and fried nice and light so they weren't greasy.  Really enjoyed those.  I had the lemongrass beef noodle bowl and my husband ordered the BBQ pork noodle bowl.  We were both impressed with the flavors of the meat and how tender it was.  The vegetables were nice and fresh too.  I love having a big pile of fresh mint to add to the dish.  The noodles were mostly ok, but a little clumpy.    His beer was good and cold in a frosty mug, and my coffee was nice as well, but it came in a smallish plastic cup full of ice.  I don't know if I'd order that again at $4.95.  Our server was friendly and helpful until the food was delivered.  Then we never saw her again.  We had to go up front to pay, and maybe that's the way they do it, but we never saw an itemized check or receipt.  We had no issues using the Yelp check-in offer of 10% off the total, but like I said, I have no idea what the itemized list was.  Before tip and after the discount, the total was $32.11.   We saw several other interesting dishes go by our table and I look forward to trying more items on the menu.  I could see stopping in often for takeout on my way home from work.

Lovely.  Just lovely.  We went about a week ago and had a nice walk/jog at the end of a very stressful day.  Just what I needed.  I want to go buy one of those horse properties across the street and have my own little retreat.  Do you think they'd take a check???  Anyway, I couldn't believe the variety of birds and other critters like rabbits, and even a rather large mouse that we saw.    There are plenty of trash cans and bags for people to pick up after their dog, even though some don't.  I self-actualize all over the place when I pick up somebody else's dog bombs and throw them away.    The library is a very nice building too and made me want to check that out in more detail on a future trip.  Beautiful trails with plenty of shade draping over them, and little creeks running by shady areas perfect for sitting and reading or just taking a nap.  This park is a great getaway from the city, in the middle of Gilbert.

I can't believe I haven't written a review for this joint yet.  To me Bogey's is a place that makes me feel like I'm back in the Midwest immediately.  I walk through that door and it's got this casual, friendly atmosphere and the later it gets it is fantastic for people watching.  Hilarious to catch the drunkenese spoken freely in the quest to hookup.     We've never had a bad experience here and enjoy the food and cheap drinks, but a couple of weeks ago we had the Pancho's Perfection pizza and I'm still thinking about it.  It was Mr. M's choice and at first I was a little leery, but the flavors were actually great!  It's a 10-inch pie with carne asada, pico de gallo, mozzarella, garlic, and olive oil for $8.75.  Very nice and a great deal!  We also shared the patty melt and waffle fries and that was all good as well.  Nice juicy burger and crisp seasoned fries.  We started the meal with the calamari app which was very filling so it's no surprise we had a bunch of leftovers.  My receipt also reads, scotch, vodka, Left Hand stout, and Rolling Rock.  I think it was a good afternoon.  All of that food and beverage came to $39.00 before tax and tip.  Not a bad deal.    We've usually had good service.  Sometimes on weekends if the servers are kinda young, you can tell they're talking with their friends, or other customers a little too long, but for the most part we have no complaints.  If we lived closer, we'd be there more often for sure.  Great bar and grill!

I'm just going to say "ditto" to Alan L's review.  It's because of his detailed review that we knew to order outside and to bring cash.  So thank you, Alan!    The Hut is a great little Chicago-style joint that took me right back, not to Chicago, but to Hot Dog Heaven in Orlando, which has been ranked in the top hot dog places in the country.  We got a polish dog, a combo with sausage and beef, chili cheese fries, and a bottle of water for something like $13.90.  GREAT dogs, low prices, friendly staff, and excellent chili cheese fries.  We sat outside so we wouldn't have to look at any Cubs gear.  (GO CARDS!)  I'm sorry it's in Gilbert, but make the drive.  It's worth it.

Comfort food and beer at it's finest!  Had to try this joint based on the Yelp reviews and after looking at the menu online.  My husband and I were out driving around aimlessly yesterday and when he said he was in the mood for a beer, I said, "I think I know just the place."    As soon as we walked in I felt like I was no longer in AZ.  The pub atmosphere is great with a lot of bar and counter seating and church pew type benches for seating, but made comfortable with cushions.  I had the Oggie and really enjoyed the tender, flavorful steak and potatoes.  The crust for the pasties was nice too.  Very flaky and buttery.  My husband had the Meat & Cheese and we both liked the spice blend in that one.  So 2/2 on the pasties.  We shared a side of chips (frites) which were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Crisp on the outside, but like floaty mashed potatoes on the inside.  3/3.    I was impressed with the beer selection.  They have everything from local brews to Oregon and CA brews to Chimay and a couple of other European ones.  I started with the Hoegaarden white, which I had never had and enjoyed immensely.  My husband ordered the Rogue Hazelnut Brown and that's not what he got.  It was a very good IPA, I suspect it was the Four Peaks IPA that was on the menu, but it definitely wasn't the Rogue which we have had many times.  He mentioned it to our server (who was great by the way, even though it was fairly busy in there), and she said he wasn't the only one to say that, but that's the beer that came out of the Rogue tap.  I think they got their kegs crossed or something.  She offered to get him something else and I forget what he ordered but it was the correct beer that time.  She didn't charge us for the first beer, which was a nice surprise when we got the check, even though we drank every last drop of it.  We didn't know what it was, but it was not going to go to waste.    I ended with the Firestone Walker Double DBA.  I think.  By that time all the blood was in my very happy belly.  They have a good amount of outdoor seating on a very attractive deck.  It was a little hot for that yesterday, but I will definitely be back to try that out.  This would also be a great place to belly up to the bar.  From what I could see all the employees were working hard to take care of their customers and I saw a lot of smiles.  How could you not be smiling with all that great food and beer and all day Happy Hour?!?!

Cornish Pasty food & service:  5/5  The Romper Room Effect 0/5  We had a late lunch around 1:30 on Easter Sunday and our server was great!  The receipt said his name was Johnny Cakes.  Somehow I doubt that's totally accurate, but hey....if it is, you go Johnny!  He was friendly and laid-back and took great care of us.  The pasties were great, as usual, and we also tried a side of their curry potatoes which were delicious!  If you like curry, these are cubed, perfectly roasted potatoes with a few roasted tomato bits as well.  They complimented the pasties and beer perfectly and I would definitely order them again.  I know it was a Sunday.  I know it was Easter Sunday, but the amount of kids screaming and running around was appalling.   Take them to the park.  Take them home.  One inconsiderate mommy was wandering around carrying her beer, half-heartedly trying to corral Screamy and Sticky and if I heard her say one of the kid's names once, I heard her say it 400 times.  (Names changed to protect the inconsiderate).  Dudson.  Dudson.  Dudson.  Dudson.  Dudson.  Ad nauseam.  He's obviously not listening, but hey, get your buzz on.  Who cares.  Several children were crying loudly and the ones that were running around were frequently in the way of the entrance and patrons coming and going.  Ridiculous.  When I'm managing my own restaurant I will politely pack their food up to go and give them clearly printed directions to the two or three nearest parks.   Letting your kids run around like wild animals is rude and inconsiderate and it's dangerous.  These are the same asshats who will sue you when their sweaty, foaming at the mouth kid falls and hurts themselves.  Send them to the park.

So after my review from Easter Sunday over 2 years ago, we've gotten food from Cornish Pasty, but have not dined in.  For some reason, this place attracts an inordinate amount of jagoff parents and their out-of-control offspring.  I just don't want to deal with it, so we'd get the food to go.  In a way, it had two benefits.  It helped to preserve my sanity, and it saved us money because we'd bring the pasties home and drink our own booze.    But, then I got the idea one night after we both had taken a nap after work, to go out and hit this place at 8:00 p.m.  I thought, well, maybe all the sticky-fingered crumbsnatchers and their oblivious parents might be home by now.    That strategy has worked out very well.  In the past month we've been back a few times, all around 8:00 p.m. and the crowd has really thinned out and we haven't had to tolerate any maniac kids.    The only aftereffect to the dinner hour we've felt was one evening we had to wait for a booth to be cleaned because a large family with a bunch of kids had made a huge mess.  It looked like a couple of pasties exploded.  Who does that?  Seriously!  Animals.  I've started trying their soups and I love the cream of leek soup with the fresh-baked bread.  I'm pretty sure they should call that bread "crackdough", it's just that good.  We sit at the bar frequently, and Megan takes great care of us.  A pint of Rogue Hazelnut Brown and the Royale with cheese pasty and I am one happy girl.

It is really difficult to try things other than our favorites, but last night we had the Cornish meatballs app ($7.75), the Guinness Stew pasty ($10), and the Chicken Greek pasty ($9.75).  None of which we had ever had before.  Those meatballs are fantastic.  What a rich flavor.  I'm going to try to duplicate it.  They are like Swedish meatballs on steroids.  Highly recommend those.  The meatballs are bacon-wrapped.  What else do you need to know?  The Guinness stew pasty was stuffed full of everything you'd expect to find in a stew and had a rich, beefy flavor.  That one is comfort food for sure.  My husband had the Chicken Greek pasty and we enjoyed the flavors in that one as well, especially the kalamata olives.  Those always add something great.    I also tried the Founders special beer they had on tap, without asking too many details because I like their brews.  It was the Breakfast Stout and it's a good strong one, priced at $9.  It paired very well with the Guinness pasty.  He had his usual, the Rogue Hazelnut brown, and then we tried the Leffe Blonde Ale.  Someday I'm going to go to Belgium to meet the monks who make such great beer.  What a gig that must be.  That one was very different from what we had been drinking, but exceptional all the same.  Now I have an excuse to go to the liquor store and look for some to have at home.  All in we spent about $50.  Mica took great care of us at the bar.  Always look forward to Cornish Pasty Co.

One star for this Safeway and my cumulative experiences here, and negative 37 stars for myself for being dumb and lazy enough to come back here tonight just because it is convenient.    I had to pick up a few things for a potluck at work tomorrow and could also multi-task and hit the redbox and ATM.  Great.  A few months ago I had purchased a modest amount of groceries, spent 80 bucks, had to wait in the lone checkout line for 25 minutes, and vowed to never return.  I should have stuck with that.  This store is nice, clean, and has bagel dogs (thank you for the heads up, Manny) but it's way overpriced and extremely understaffed.  The checkout line has always been painfully slow.  As we stand in the express lane something goes wrong with the payment machine.  It locks up and says CLOSED.  Our fearless cashier, Charles, calls someone over and says, "It's locked up again.  I saw so and so fix it a couple times today, but I don't remember what he did".    OK.  Stop right here.  It's been having issues all day and you're still using it?  Why don't you dust off one of the 15 other registers that never get used and fire that baby up?    That would be silly.  What was I thinking?  Just a side note, the woman in front of us who was waiting to pay had ice cream and the woman behind us had ice cream.  Isn't that always the way?    Destini came over to help the intrepid Charles with the machine.  They continued to discuss how the machine kept having issues and tried to remember how to fix it.  Gripping.  Not one word to the customers waiting to pay and get on with their lives.  Can you just feel the ice cream melting?  Well, we decided to try our luck at the register beside us, along with the gal with the ice cream behind us and got in line over there.  Charles calls us back over and says it is fixed.  He heard me say to my husband "it always takes forever here".  Without missing a beat as he is scanning our items, Charles says, "Patience is a virtue."    Now, Charlie, I really admire you having the hair on your peaches to say that comment, albeit to the scanner.  Next time have the cajones to look the customer in the eye and I'll really respect you.  I said to him, "So is being efficient."  They absolutely don't care.  There was no effort to try to expedite customers and get them on their way.  Destini mumbled a "sorry folks" as we left.  Good customer service costs nothing.  It's about slapping a smile on your face and saying "How are you tonight?  Can I help you find anything?", the scarce "Thank you!", and it's about being mindful of a customer's time.  And it's certainly not about popping off with a comment about patience when things go wrong.  It was 100 degrees today and it's 5:30.  Do you really think people want to stand around and wait for you to fix a machine that has been having issues all day?  I guess in a unionized cocoon you don't have to worry about such things.  I would really love to see where Charlie is in 10 years.  Now that would be interesting.

On Saturday I had done a bunch of painting in the house, so we decided to spend the night out at a hotel and let the house air out.  We stayed at the Hampton Inn right across the street and walked over to Hob Nob.  It was a difficult decision to not go to Rudy's trust me.    Hob Nob was a pleasant surprise.  I thought we'd just sit and have a couple of drinks and some apps, but the food turned out to be good and on par with some of the other good sports bars in the area.  We started with a Moscow mule for me ($6) and a gluten-free beer from WI that my husband wanted to try just to see what it tasted like.  It was a nice, crisp pilsner.  We shared the small nachos with ground beef and those were good and cheesy and the salsa was nice and spicy.  That brought on a 2nd round of drinks.  Mules all around.  Then I had the patty melt with 50/50 o rings and tots, and he ordered the pulled pork sliders.  I thought the sliders were a great deal getting 5 per order.  The buns were Hawaiian-style which is always good, and the pork was fine, but tasted like it came out of a plastic container.  The pickles helped.    My patty melt was excellent.  The burger tastes like good 80/20, and I really liked that you can get 50/50 of fries, o rings, or tots.  The onion rings taste EXACTLY like Dairy Queen's.  Exactly.  Danelle was our server and she was friendly and fun to talk to.  We got a kick out of the guys playing pool near us with all the smack talk going on.  Pretty entertaining.  They have some dart boards too, and TVs everywhere.  Overall, I would definitely return to Hob Nob, in spite of it being a Chicago sports bar.  (GO RED BIRDS!....I don't know about anyone else, but I am so ready for baseball season).

I don't need to say much here.  Read the other 4 and 5-star reviews and look at the pictures.  This place took me right back to Lockhart, TX.  Excellent BBQ!  We had the pulled pork sandwich a la carte, and then the 2 meat dinner with ribs, brisket, beans, and fries.  Everything was perfect.  Too bad it's 60 miles each way or we'd be there a couple times a month at least.

When we rolled in to Blue 32 last Saturday I was such a grouch.  I hate leaving the house on Saturdays, especially this close to Christmas.  But I wanted to take Mr. M to Fox Cigar Bar because we always have a good time there, so we were in the area.    I had a few coupons burning a hole in my pocket for some stores in the San Tan Village area, but it was so crowded I couldn't bring myself to get out of the car.  No way, Jose.  Saving 15% is not worth my sanity.  Beer.  That's what I need.  A nice cold beer.  Based on some friends' recommendations we decided to try Blue 32 and as soon as we walked in we were greeted with 2 screaming kids.  Give me a freakin' break.  I almost left, but we were seated in a corner table up by the window, so the screaming was off in the distance a little.    Started out with a couple of Sierra Nevada ales and the shrimp and bacon quesadilla.  Both disappeared in about 2 minutes.  We ate that quesadilla like it owed us money.  Great flavors and grilled nice and crisp.  Not floppy like a lot of places who are in a hurry to get the food out.    Then I had a house salad and a cup of the potato soup.  Mr. M had the wings and rib entrée.  We proceeded to have a little feast of our own.  GREAT wings and ribs!  Nice fresh little salad, and PERFECT potato soup!  I used to make 2 soups/day from scratch for a couple of restaurants a hundred years ago, and I love soup.  This baked potato soup was the best I've ever had and I'm craving it again.  They need to build a Blue 32 in that dying plaza near me at Alma School and Queen Creek.  I'd be over there every day eating soup and drinking beer.  Our server was Marysa and she was the best.  When we were talking about soup she said we should try their chili and brought us a sample.  No beans, and perfect as well.  GREAT chili.  A customer sitting behind us said they have the best chili in town.  I'm inclined to agree with him.    They have plenty of TVs for all the games going on.  Personally, I'm just killing time until baseball season starts again.  Hockey will do for now.  Overall, I would happily go back to Blue 32.  When we left I was no longer a grouch.  Great visit!

By 5-stars I mean as good as it gets for bar food.  They really do an excellent job here.  Since my last review we've been back a couple of times and continue to have outstanding service and have tried the kobe dog and the grinder.  Everything was great except for one item.  The only complaint I have is they need to get better hot dog buns.  They used the same bun for the dog and for the grinder and it was dried out and way too big for the dog.  It reminded me of those cheap school lunch buns that taste like sugar and stick to the roof of your mouth.  We were able to pick out the innards though and really enjoyed that.  Forget the bun.  It would be much better with fresh bread like Jimmy John's or Flancer's uses.

As I mentioned in my review for Dillard's, I am not a mall person.  Just the thought of going to the mall annoys me.  But, I had to pick up some new suit pieces and find some updated jewelry this weekend.  I should have waited the extra hour until Dillard's opened, but I wanted to get in and get out.  Macy's was open on Sunday so I wandered around until I found the women's suits, tried on a few jackets, found a couple that would work, and cruised through the jewelry section.  I found a necklace and bracelet that I thought would look nice and then came the ultimate task.  Finding an employee to ring me up.  I walked around and looked all over and it took about 10 minutes to find someone.  There was a very nice young man working just past the purses and he said he'd be happy to ring me up.    Great.  I can get on with my life.  Well, I got home and tried on the jewelry with my suits and it just didn't work for me.  So today I made the mistake of doing the return.  Again it took me a long time to find someone wearing a nametag, and when I did, she was very busy having a conversation with a customer.  Not ringing her up.  Just talking.  I heard comments like, "Oh well, you know that's the way retail is now."  Tell me.  How is it now?  The employees all tend to their personal business and ignore the customers?    When I finally caught her eye, condescendingly laid on me over her green reading glasses, I said, "I have a return.  Can you help me with that?"  She said "Yes", and then gave me an impatient hand motion like get over here so I can get you out of my way.   You did not just do that...  Then she said, "Oh, is it fine jewelry?"    Well, I don't know about "fine", but it's jewelry, so I said, "Yes".    "Oh well then you're going to have to go over to fine jewelry."  And then she turned around and went back to her conversation.  Oh my my.  Menopause Mary, you are a delight.    I walked over by the jewelry counter and found 2 employees and a customer leaning on the counter chatting.  I stood there smiling and staring at them and didn't even get a look.  They continued to talk about their kids and grandkids.  Well shoot.  I must be missing the secret password today.  So I wandered around the corner, and finally found someone who could do my return.    Holy moley.  I'm not going back in here again and facing that crotchety old crew.  I feel sorry for that nice young man who has to work with them.  Yikes!

You want to know what kind of coworker I am?  Well I'll tell ya.  Last Monday or Tuesday one of my cohorts started talking about donuts.  Someone had just brought in Bosa donuts, which were fine, but my man L.J. brought up LaMar's and half the room moaned with pleasure.  Oh yeah!  I haven't had a donut from LaMar's in about 6 years, and that was on my honeymoon in Fort Collins, no less.  Yes, donuts on my honeymoon.  We ate a lot of nachos and drank a lot of beer too.  It was awesome.  Anyway, right that second I decided that I was going to get up early and bring in some LaMar's donuts last Friday.  I woke up at 4:00, got dressed with my eyes closed, and hit the road.  I got to LaMar's at 5:32 a.m. and they were already busy.  Three people were inside, 2 cars were in the drive-thru, and the phone was ringing off the hook.  I'm glad I didn't choose the drive-thru because I could hear one of those oblivious morons going "Uh....ummm....I'll take 3 dozen donuts.  Ummm....4 plain cake donuts and three...no make that 6 glazed donuts....what kind of cake donuts do you have?....OK.  I'll take 3 buttermilk donuts....what flavors do you have in those?....OK.  How many do I have left?"    Ugh.  Mad Max that woman right out the way! Go inside, dingleberry!  I ordered 2 dozen assorted, with 6 glazed, and a two-tone twist donut for myself.  Excellent service and even more excellent donuts.  I got two big hugs from two handsome men when they got to the office and got a load of those donuts.  Totally worth it.

And I am saying "Woohoo!  As good as it gets!" because I was totally shocked to find a place this good in Casa Grande.  For a minute I thought I was on The Hill in St. Louis.    Let me back up a minute.  Did you ever have one of those days where you had 18 things to do and you didn't want to do any of them?    I know you have.   We had one of those and so decided to drive around aimlessly toward Casa Grande.  Did some shopping.  Got hungry.  Now I have never been impressed by the restaurant choices in CG and usually end up just grabbing fast food or speeding back to Chandler.  Well, after checking the reviews on yelp, we decided to try Tommy's, and I am so glad we did.  Our server, Alex, was wonderful.  She took our drink and app order right away, and then gave us time to look over the menu.  We never felt rushed and she was ahead of the game with the leftover pizza box and the check.  The food speaks for itself in the pictures I took.    The prices are absolutely a steal for the quality of food we had.  The restaurant is decorated very nicely on the inside and we had a cozy booth.  The bar area is large and they have a huge outdoor patio.  I look forward to taking a friend of mine who loves Italian food.  Tommy's is an absolute gem!

I seriously think that Karen is one of the nicest people we've met in the 5 years we've been in Arizona.  Shoot...I think she's one of the nicest people I've met EVER!    We had a vacation planned for the first week of September, and I can't remember when I first reached out to Karen, but it was quite awhile before that because I knew we were around the Labor Day weekend and it might be very busy for her.    We had a nice conversation over the phone and set up a day/time for her to come over and meet the pets and check out the house.  She was great about checking in and verifying the day/time and had lots of good questions for us about the cats and the house.  As soon as I met her I knew everything would be well taken care of.  The week we were out of town I think there were two or three monsoon storms and she took care of the pool as well.  We had had a couple of bad experiences with other pet sitters in the area, and I am beyond thrilled to find Karen.  She.  Is.  Awesome.  Put your pets and home in her hands, and you won't have a thing to worry about.

I live ridiculously close to Sauce so we get take-out from there frequently and have never had a bad experience.  The Vegetable Chop Salad is full of fresh vegetables and almost makes me feel like it cancels out the pizza and booze I'm about to consume.  We've tried the Sausage and Pepperoni, which also has roasted red peppers, red onion, and crimini mushrooms, Sausage and Carmelized Onion, Portobello & Artichoke, and Rosemary Potato thin crust pizzas.  All great with a crisp crust and fresh toppings.  Those carmelized onions are downright magical!    Each time we call and pick up the food the service has been fast and friendly.  Sauce thin crust pizza is a great choice when we want fresh pizza that's not going to throw us into a food coma.  Maybe I'll try something else on the menu, but the ones I mentioned are so good, we have a hard time choosing just one or two.  And, as a bonus, the leftovers make a great breakfast the next morning with a fried egg on top.  Delicious!!

So I cooked at Thanksgiving and I wasn't about to do it for Christmas.  I wanted to go out and eat, drink, and be merry so we got reservations at Verona Chophouse for 11:15 on Christmas day.   This was our first visit and overall it really was a good experience.  If I'm being honest, my review is more of a 3.5.  They open at 11:00 and we got there around 11:05.  We were about 5th in line to get in.  One drawback was standing in line next to the Fairy's Mist or Bounty or some shit slot machine while Ol Lady Wild Turkey smokes her Kool 100s and waves them around and cackles about the good deals she got in Laughlin.  Good Lord....  We were seated right on time.  The selections on the buffet were nice.  Some stand-outs were the prime rib, scalloped potatoes, bacon, and scrambled eggs.  I didn't go near the salad section, but it looked good and fresh from where I stood getting my plate full of bacon and eggs.  For $30 apiece I didn't think it was too bad of a value, but a cheap mimosa thrown in would have been nice.  The only thing that wasn't good on the buffet was the cubed sweet potatoes.  They were only about half cooked and had NO flavor.  A chef-type person kept walking around surveying the scene and I can't believe those sweet potatoes were put out.  Not good at all.    We also didn't use the omelet station, but we sat very close to it and it appeared that the young woman cooking was very friendly and fast and the omelets looked good.  I wasn't going to go near the dessert area, but there were a couple of things I just could not resist.  They had mini cannolis and then some small tartlets with what tasted like a peanut butter mousse.  Delicious!    Their patio area is so lovely and next time I want to be sure to sit out there if weather permits.  Our server was very attentive and friendly too.  There was one snafu I think with some of the staff trying to light one of those heaters outside or something because suddenly there was some screaming and I wondered if I needed to grab my knife and hit the deck, but it was something to do with the heater I think.  I can see what other reviewers say about the servers.  Most appear to be just fine, but I think they could take the professionalism up a notch.  This is a nice place, and they should treat it as such.  Not that they were bad, but those that have been there probably know what I mean.  When we walked in we noticed the wine bar area looked really nice.  I think next time we'll try to snag a table in there.  I am optimistic that when we go back we'll have another good experience.

I will write a more detailed review later on if I ever try something other than the Cuban sandwich, but it is so good I have flashbacks to when I lived in Florida and had the real deal Cuban food there.  I always get the Cuban and the sweet fried plantains, which are totally addictive.  Oh, and an ice cold Negra Modelo.    As I was leaving the last time I heard another customer say, "That was the best mojito I've ever had!"  so I know what I'm trying the next time I go back.   I'll really try to branch out from the Cuban sandwich, but the bread is perfect, the pork is fall-apart tender & flavorful, the ham is tasty and moist, and the blend with mustard and pickles is the way it should be.  Perfection.  I need to learn the name of the regular server I have too.  She is always friendly and funny.  We have been about a half dozen times, and have never been disappointed.

Alright.  To be fair, over the past couple of days I had just gotten caught up on my back issues of Whisky Advocate and I went into this store full of great ideas for tasty beverages for Christmas and birthday gifts.    I think the Fry's near me has a more varied bourbon selection.  No Elijah Craig.  No Cave Creek bourbon.  Meh.  Basil Hayden will do just fine, but I was not impressed with the overall choices.  Yes there are some good well-known ones, like Woodford Reserve, etc, but not much variety if you are looking for something special or small batch.  I did score some cool Guinness glasses in the gift section that Mr. M will love.    What pushed me to the 2-star review was that while I was in the bourbon aisle it was very crowded because on the opposite side is all the rum, etc and other stuff I don't buy.  The only clear liquors I buy are Belvedere and a couple of tequilas.  OK.  Maybe several tequilas, but anyway, it was crowded.  I had already been almost run over by a tall employee in a big hurry, and then suddenly, in the aisle comes 4 employees pushing 2 large carts with boxes to unpack, and another employee dragging a huge ladder to get or put something on the top shelf.    I did see the truck at the loading dock, so maybe it was late, but generally isn't all the shelf-stocking supposed to go on after hours?  I don't see why in the world all that mess needed to come into that aisle at once either.  But the real kicker, was that the employees openly expressed their frustration.  I heard one comment, of "we'll never get this done."  Yeah.  Darn those customers anyway.    You know what?  It costs nothing to say, "Hi.  How ya doin'?"    "Hi.  You look thirsty.  Is there something I can help you find?"    "Need any help finding anything?"    And then, maybe those pesky customers will find their booze and get out of your way.  Ridiculous and rude was my experience today.    The cashier was nice so she gets one of the stars and the makers of Basil Hayden get the other one.  I've been to this store a couple of times and always had mediocre to rude service and don't plan on returning.  Every time I find myself in Gilbert anyway, I always think, "Why the hell am I in Gilbert?  I don't have a mini-van or a fat SUV and a herd of obnoxious kids and dogs I take everywhere.  I don't belong here!"

I was a very loyal BevMo shopper.  Now, after visiting two different Total Wine's, I think I'm going to switch my allegiance.  BevMo's prices have been going up and up and up, and they send out those puny 5% coupons.  Yeah, thanks for taking care of half the tax.  (insert eye roll here)  I got some great deals at Total Wine, such as the 750 ml Belvedere for $18.50.  What?!?  That's usually closer to 30 bucks.  I was in this one on Christmas Eve, so of course it was a madhouse.  I plan to go back when it's slower and really dig through the craft beer and bourbon sections.  Helllloooooo Total Wine!  You made my Christmas!

Since my last review, I have become a total convert from BevMo.  I do not care for the Total Wine in Gilbert, but this one is its polar opposite.  Helpful employees who love to talk about booze like we do, great prices, and an excellent selection.  Always a pleasure to shop at this Total Wine.

In the area for work this week and discovered that I packed my suitcase like Willy Wonka would have.  Plenty of junk food.  NO necessaries.  (I did remember my collection of pocket knives.  Thanks TSA).  So I swung in here to get the random list of items I needed.  Clean, beautiful store.  Friendly employees, and I had the added benefit of watching some cash register rage when a spry geriatric got really peeved at the loud, slow, self-centered Jersey-types in front of her.  GET IT ON, GRANNY!  Smack down at register 4!!

For me it's the simple things.  The simple things done very well.  And employees who actually, genuinely seem happy to see customers.  Imagine that.  (Take note Sprouts employees...you grouchy fockers).    I was the only person in the joint today around 11:30 and got myself a ground beef taco, a Coke, and a cinnamon and sugar fry bread for dessert.  I LOVED that the young man working the register asked me if I'd like to get the cinn & sug fry bread a little later.  Why yes I would!  For 2 reasons.  If you give it to me with my taco, I will eat all of it first and the taco will get cold.  Second, I made myself eat about a third of the taco, enjoying every bite, and saving room for my dessert, which was warm and cinnamoney and sugary and delicious!    Delicious is the word of the day for this place.  I enjoyed every aspect of my meal, and I was glad to see the place start to fill up as I was leaving.  I will try to be more adventurous next time and get something with stronger flavors, but I LOVE simple beef tacos.  For me they are comfort food, and this was a great one.  Go check them out if you haven't!

After 2 solid days on Labor Day weekend of trudging up and down The Strip behind gaggles of slow-moving tourists, we decided to get up on Monday 9/3 and skip breakfast, heading straight to Aces & Ales for an early lunch.  Oh what peace and quiet.  It was wonderful.  There was one other table occupied and 3 guys at the bar who looked like they had just finished a round of golf.  I got the impression that this place appeals to a wide variety of people, and I bet at night it is hopping.    As others have said, the beer and liquor selection is hard to beat.  I like that the beer list also shows the ABV and type of beer.  I'm pretty adventurous when it comes to trying beers, but having some idea of what I'm getting into is much appreciated.  For an app we ordered the beer bites which are pizza crust balls seasoned up and then you have marinara, ranch, or cheese sauce to dip them in.  These were so damn good that next time I'm getting my own order!  Their ranch didn't taste like bottled ranch....it was more dilly.  I liked it a lot.    Mr. M ordered the lunch steak sandwich with bacon cheddar cheese fries.  He loved the bacon cheese fries, but said the steak sandwich was just ok.  To expand on that he said the bun was kind of stale and the steak didn't have much flavor.  I had a BLT on rye and it was great.  The bread was nice and fresh and the B,L, and T were just how they were supposed to be.  With onion rings on the side my meal was a simple but perfect lunch.    I didn't catch the bartender's name, but she was just super.  Attentive and educated on the beverage choices.  Overall we had a great visit and I look forward to going back.

I was in Vegas for work last week, and for the last night there I brought a coworker with me, we'll call him Mr. K, and explained that this might be the best beer bar he has ever been to.  I know.  I know.  That's a lot of build up.  The receipt said Wendy and Jeff, and if that's accurate, both of them took excellent care of us.  They are funny, friendly, and knowledgeable about beer.  I love them.  OK.  I don't LOVE them love them. I'm not a complete weirdo.  I was the DD so had to select my one drink very carefully.  I believe it was a New Belgium/Lost Abbey collaboration, Brett Beer.    I think this is supposed to be a sour ale, but it's not very sour.  I was calling it a farmhouse ale, but I don't think that's right.  I enjoyed it.    I don't remember exactly what Mr. K had.  I do know that one of his beers was aged in Wild Turkey barrels and he liked that a lot.  Normally I am in awe of the beer, which is expected, but the food that night.  The food was amazing.  So simple yet so good.  I had the grilled cheese with cheddar, slices of apple, and bacon.  Need I say more?  Yes I do.  I also had the Arrogant Bastard onion rings, and when I forced one upon Mr. K, he said that was the best onion ring he has had in his life.  Yeah.  It's that good.  He ordered a pizza with I think shrooms and sausage and possibly pepperoni.  I forget, but I swiped a piece and it was very good.  The crust is not too thick, not too thin, just perfect.  Delicious with the beer.  Now I remember why my memory is so bad.  We were carbo overloading.  I've been thinking about the beer bites since the last time I was here and we started with those.  Just as good as I remember and I was happy to share since I knew we weren't done yet.  I love this place.  And I mean really love it.

Mr. M & I had tickets to go see Ron White at The Mirage on 9/2 and since I snagged a coupon from one of those timeshare slickmeisters for a free app at BB King's we thought we'd have dinner here before the show.  Now, based on the reviews I didn't have high expectations, but I saw a couple of items on the menu that looked ok so what the heck.  We were also slapped with the $5 cover charge by the snotty little hostess.  I tell ya what....I know she probably deals with a lot of crap from the public, but she was NOT NICE.  I saw on her fancy computer that they also have a $15 cover charge button.  For $15 cover the Black Crowes better be on stage and there better be some good secondhand hemp smoke for me to enjoy.  Anyway....she said there would be live music.  Yeah, 40 minutes later there was a good band that came on stage.  A REALLY good band.  But seriously we got to hear 4 songs then had to go.  My theory started then that the owners of this particular BB King's Club are moneygrubbers.  It will be proven as fact later that night.  I was really glad the app was free because it was two beef tamales just like the ones you can find in the freezer at Trader Joe's.  I like the Trader Joe's grub ok, but one of the tamales had sat too long on one side or something in the steam table and it was hard and would have been better used as a shim under our wobbly table leg.    We shared the entree and I'm glad we did because it was a huge amount of food.  The pork chop dinner was good all around.  Two moist pork chops, perfectly cooked and seasoned with fresh green beans, real mashed potatoes with the red skins still on, and those baked cinnamon apples were all the dessert we needed.  We both agreed that meal was really good, but the app was terrible.   The steak knife was completely dull.  When I first cut into a chop I thought, "Oh no, this thing is all dried out and tough", but it was the knife.  They need some new ones.  Terribly dull.  Thank God we didn't really need it.  Our server was really nice, but like others have said the service is painfully slow.  As I was looking around it seems like the servers have a lot of ground to cover in that joint.  It's pretty big, so maybe that adds to the slowness.   OK.  Take an intermission now.  We went to Ron's show which was hysterical.  Then Ron invited everyone with a ticket back over to BB King's to listen to his wife sing.  Awesome.  We got our table and the server was there lickety split to take our drink order.   For $8 I got a urine sample sized plastic cup with some mediocre red wine and for $9 my husband got a plastic cup full of ice, water, & a splash of Dewars.  I felt like those overpriced drinks were an insult and therefore proved my theory that the owners of this place are moneygrubbers.  Those drinks were like someone wasn't even trying.  Awful waste of money.  The pork chop dinner is 3 stars, and the rest of the evening is a 1.  So they get two.  I will probably never go back to this joint unless the Black Crowes are there.

My husband and I have eaten here over a dozen times in the past year and a half and never had a bad meal.  Some real stars on their menu are:  Eggplant Paesano and Chicken Marsala, both in portions perfect for sharing with another person.  The pizza is exceptional, with a light chewy crust, not thin and not thick but just right, and the toppings are all fresh.  I always order this combo and it is one of our favorite pizzas anywhere:  meatballs, sausage, artichoke hearts, and mushrooms.  I took a friend there who had been to Brooklyn Boys once and said she didn't like it.  Well after I gave her a slice of that pizza, she said that was the best pizza she ever had!  The calzones are wonderful too, with some of the smoothest, creamiest ricotta I have ever had.   Also, the garlic knots and calamari are always spot on and the wine selection is limited but very good.  A good mix of American and Italian wines.  They used to have a very entertaining bartender, Scott, but the last time I was there they said he moved to NY.  That made me sad because he was funny as hell.  But it's still a great experience and I'm glad we didn't move too far away and can still make the half hour drive to Brooklyn Boys.  Well worth it!

I never in a million years thought I'd be writing a 5-star review for a car dealership.  In the past year or so my husband and I have visited a couple of dealerships to check out a few cars we were interested in.  My car was 12 years old and his is 16 years old, so we knew the day was coming that we'd have to buy a new car.  At first we were settled on a Nissan Xterra, and visited the nearby dealerships...what is it...that Nissan dealership near Gilbert and the 202, and that Autonation Nissan dealership over in Tempe.  Had weird and annoying experiences at both.  Not going to buy there.  Then we realized that we'd have a hard time fitting an Xterra in these skimpy garages in AZ, so we set that idea off to the side.  I made an internal job change so I'm not traveling anymore and needed to be sure I had a reliable vehicle for a 16-mile commute every day.  Not a long commute considering what it could be in this city, but I don't want to worry about my old car burning oil, overheating, etc.  So we decided to get an Elantra.  They are sporty, fuel-efficient, affordable, and comfortable for a mid-sized car.  Easy enough.    I contacted the dealership via email first and met Mike Rigney.  I can't say enough good things about Mike.  He was very fast at responding to my questions via email, and then we arranged a time for me to come in.  From start to finish, with a trade in, I was out of there in less than 3 hours.  They gave me a fair price for the trade in, negotiating the price and financing was easy, and Mike truly made the whole experience a pleasure.  When my husband's old car dies, he is the first person we will contact.  The sales manager, Tom, also reached out to me via email to see how things were going, and when it took awhile to hear from my lender, he got me the name of the lender and I was able to contact them and get payments set up.  Geez.  I haven't had a car payment in 7 years.  Oh well.  It was time.  And I am very happy with the whole experience and feel a little bad that I won't need another car for myself for at least another 10 years.  My husband's old Mazda is still limping along though, and when it dies, we'll be going to see these guys for sure.

Stopped in for lunch today and ordered the Cabo plate with an original fish taco, grilled shrimp burrito, pinto beans, and chips.  When I walked in I noticed how bright, clean, and open the restaurant was and I liked that the décor had a beachy theme.  I've never eaten at a Rubio's and was not sure what to order because there are so many choices.  A big picture of the original fish taco looked pretty good and then I saw that I could get this combo plate and try a couple of different items.  The fish taco was so damn good I ate that in about 20 seconds.  Nice light fish, not greasy at all, and the tortilla was nice and soft.  The cabbage and sauce were nice accompaniments.  Did I see that on Tuesdays after 2:30 those are $1.50?  That is a great deal and I could just eat a couple of those and have a beer and be happy.  The grilled shrimp burrito was stuffed full and very flavorful.  I try to avoid spicy food and I didn't see anywhere on the menu board that it mentioned this was spicy, but it was sneaky.  I would have a few bites that were fine and then one that would taste like a jalapeno and burn my mouth.  Overall it was tolerable, but I was a little thrown off by the inconsistency in heat.  It wasn't a bad burrito at all, and I would get it again.  I just wish I could have had a Corona to wash it down, but I had more work to do this afternoon.  The pinto beans were kind of mashed up and had some melted cheese on top which was fine with me.  It was like a tasty side of bean dip.  I liked the chips as well, which were light, warm, and fresh.    I tried their mango iced tea based on the recommendation of the cashier, and it was ok, but not a lot of flavor for me.  I ended up switching to a Coke when I went back for a refill.  The staff was very friendly and overall I had a really good lunch.  Now I'll know what to expect and look forward to trying some of their other items.  AND I'll pay attention to when those fish tacos are on sale because they are great!

In the past 6 months, I've probably hit the drive-thru for breakfast maybe a dozen times.  They always have fresh, fluffy biscuits and either the chicken or bacon, egg, & cheese breakfast biscuit is pretty tasty.  I love their bacon.  It's the real deal.  Not that flappy see-through stuff that a lot of places use.  That and an original iced coffee is an ok breakfast for me.    If I can get what I order.  My order has been wrong probably 10 out of those 12 times.  Sometimes there's no cheese on the biscuit.  Once there was no egg.  Always the bacon is there...thank God.  About half the time that I order a large original iced coffee I'll get the vanilla.  I hate the vanilla flavoring they use.  I don't know what's in it, but it's not vanilla.  Tastes like bathroom air freshener to me.    Once I made the mistake of trying the breakfast burrito.  That has to contain a frozen mix with the meat, onions, and peppers.  If you've read any of my reviews when hotels try to pass that stuff off, I'll always comment on it.  It's awful and always has the flavor of freezer burnt peppers and onions.  Restaurants shouldn't even go there and use that stuff.  Thankfully there are plenty of places nearby to get an excellent breakfast burrito.    This morning just as an example I ordered the #3 (bacon, egg, & cheese biscuit meal) with a large original iced coffee.  What I got was the biscuit with no cheese, bland hash rounds, and a medium vanilla iced coffee, and no straw in the bag.    Done.  Done.  Doneski.

I am slacking on my reviews.  We've been here probably 40 times in the past 4 years.  What's up with not giving them some Yelp love?    I think 37 of those times were for breakfast and we have worked our way through most of the breakfast menu.  Love the huge omelets and fried potatoes that come on the side.  Never had a bad meal here.  Most recently Mr. M and I had had a very long day of work and house hunting and were exhausted.  I suggested Chompie's because I was craving some soup.  I had the matzo ball soup and he had the clam chowder.  Both were delicious and we were passing those bowls back and forth.  I ended up keeping the chowder and taking a large bowl of it home for Saturday.  They only have the chowder on Fridays, but they have 5 or 6 other kinds of soup every day.    I also had the Jewish sliders and he had a half sandwich with hard salami and Havarti on sourdough.  I can't even type hard salami without getting the giggles, let alone say it.  Their famous sliders were excellent as always and Mr. M's sandwich accompanied the soup perfectly.    The bakery counter is amazing and full of all kinds of goodies.  I try not to look at it when I'm in there or I will get sucked in.    Only once out of all the times we've been here have we had bad service and that was an older broad working the bakery counter who was ignoring everyone so she could chat with her friend about how things used to be in New York.  blah blah blah.  She needed a reminder that she was at work, BUT I haven't seen her in a long, long time so maybe she moved back East.  Usually the employees are very friendly and efficient.  I would say Chompie's is my #1 breakfast choice and then the Biscuits on Dobson.  Excellent food every time!

I agree with those that say the portions are small, but the carne asada is like no other!  Very tender and full of flavor.  Beachy little getaway without the beach when we're in the ASU area.  The employees have always been friendly and I enjoy their spiked drinky drinks.

Paletas Betty provided a refreshing cool treat after our meal at San Tan this afternoon.  We walked down the block and around the corner and I had a blueberry lemonade popsicle and Mr. M had a mango popsicle.  For $2.50 each they beat the hell out of a fatty 8-dollar dessert at a restaurant.  We will definitely be returning for more of these.  The mango tasted like I was eating a chilled fresh mango and the blueberry flavor just popped AND that one turned my tongue purple, so that was a bonus.  I am so glad we stepped into this nice, clean little shop.  We'll definitely be back.

Well, I'm glad I went back and can most definitely add a couple of stars to the review.  Last time was so awful.  Chatty Cathy bartender reminded me of my brother's baby mama who never shuts her piehole.  I mean never.  I think the Bob & Tom song, "She's Talking Again" was written with her in mind.  ANYWAY, our return visit was perfect.  Great beers.  We had a couple of pints and also tried a sampler.  They had so many choices it was hard to decide, but no worries, I can always come up with a good beer to drink.    We shared an order of BBQ wings which were fried perfectly and had plenty of tasty sauce to get all over ourselves and suck it off our fingers loudly and make the couple next to us with small children nervous.    Then what?    Oh yeah, more tasty beers and then Mr. M had the pulled pork sandwich with onion rings and the sandwich reminded me of Rudy's pulled pork.  Very nice!  O rings were good too.  I had the fish wrap and am still thinking about that.  It was so simple, but so good.  The fish was cooked perfectly and not greasy, and then was surrounded by fresh vegs in a soft tortilla.  Loved it.    Our service was perfect this time too.  We had two people who kept an eye on us.  I lost track of my main receipt, but the sampler receipt says Katy, and there was a dude walking around helping out too.  I can't remember his name, but I want to say Jason.  The dude with the beard who knows a lot about beer.  He was fun to talk to.  I like to see servers helping each other out.    They also had some drool-worthy choices on the weekend breakfast menu if memory serves.  Something like bacon chocolate chip pancakes or French toast.  I don't know.  Better go back this weekend and find out.  Check their website to make sure I know what I'm talking about.  Overall it was great and now I definitely won't wait so long to go back.

The 5-star rating is well-deserved.  Thank you fellow Yelpers for guiding me through the moving-out-of-a-rental process through the home-buying process.  We found great people to work with across the board.   I have to say Brian was the most fun and interesting person to work with.  His knowledge and attention to detail is amazing!  We lived in a rental for 3 1/2 years that was not in great shape when we moved into it.  We tried to do our best to take care of it, but there were many stains on that carpet prior to us living in the house.  He got most of them out!  We couldn't be happier.  The clowns at the management company are going to have to look long and hard to find reasons to keep our deposit.    It was easy to book the appointment and my husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed talking with Brian.  I almost regret that we moved into a house with very little carpet because I would absolutely work with Brian again, no question.  Thanks so much!

One of Mr. M's coworkers was raving about the egg rolls from this place, so one afternoon after visiting the Halloween stores in the area we decided to stop in and try 'em out.  We also got an order of their salt and pepper calamari.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a friendly gentleman who asked us if this was our first visit.  He took our to-go order and then offered and brought us some water while we waited.  The egg rolls were very good and fresh and not greasy at all.  The calamari was exceptional with light tempura-style breading that was fresh, crispy, and also not greasy.  The peppers and onions provided a great grilled flavor and made us wish we had a couple of cold beers in hand to have with our very tasty appetizers.   I brought up not greasy twice because it's typical that takeout Chinese places have good greasy food that goes great with adult beverages.  Gold Chef on the other hand is not greasy, but still goes well with adult beverages.  I look forward to going back and trying their full meals.  First visit was impressive.

Mr. M & I went out for a day date on Sunday and I wanted to surprise him by taking him to Fox's.  We live close to Maduro's, but from the reviews Fox's sounded like a good cigar bar as well.    I like the smell of cigars, but that's really where it ends for me.  I did enjoy sitting at the bar sipping some Woodford Reserve and watching sports on TV with my man, but it's probably not a place I would return to again unless we sit outside.  First, like some of the reviews mentioned, it's pretty much a penis party in this joint, which is to be expected, and some of those guys seem to be pretty territorial over their spots.    Nothing like listening to some loud talking blowhards go on for an hour about golf or football, etc.  OK Richard, I get it that you are avoiding the wife and kids, but strut on out to your 'Vette and let someone else have a crack at the comfy leather chairs.  The bar stools were ok, but after sitting there for a little over an hour my cheeks were asleep.  I can tell they have an excellent ventilation system, but you're still going to come out smelling like a lovely cigar no matter what.  We decided we'd come back for sure when it cools off a bit and partake of the outdoor seating.  The employees and the booze selection deserves 5 stars for sure!  And the prices were very reasonable.  I can't remember the woman who waited on us at the bar...it was Miranda, Melinda, Amanda.....I apologize, but she was great and attentive without hovering and when I was curious about a Woodford Reserve bottle I had never seen before she was happy to take it down and let us look at it.  We also saw her at Cantina Laredo afterwards and she waved at us.  Really friendly people working at Fox's.   Overall we decided we'd definitely go back.

Visited the stadium for the first time yesterday and overall really enjoyed the facility.  Parking was easy and 5 bucks and the grounds are beautiful with several practice fields surrounding the main stadium.  Ticket takers and ushers were friendly and helpful since we'd never been there before, and my first question was...."Where can I get a margarita?"  I was pointed in the direction of Salty Senorita, and soon I was a happy girl with my drink.  I had purchased 2 $21-dollar tickets off the 3rd base line behind the Dbacks dugout.  I don't think this stadium has a bad seat.  And shade is plentiful, which was a little chilly yesterday, but will come in handy soon enough here in AZ.  We were enjoying the view and then were joined in the row behind us by grandpa, dad, and 2-yr-old Kicky and 4-yr-old Screamy.  SOOOOOO.....we decided to mosey on around the park and look for another tasty beverage.  Speaking of tasty beverages, I love the fact that they have AZ and CO craft brews represented.  I think I scared a guy when I jumped up and asked him, "Where did you get that Oskar Blues beer?!?!?"  He was happy to tell me.    It was a good experience overall.  If I were to go again, I would just buy the cheapest ticket possible because if you get tired of the grass, there are plenty of other places to sit.  Being a Sunday I wasn't too shocked that it was a bit of a romper room with unattended crumbsnatchers everywhere.  And, we were highly entertained by the two May-December couples sitting at the back of the grass area with the chippies giving their "daddies" pseudo lap dances.  I hope some children got an education that day.  I know we got a good laugh.  Oh yeah baby, you've got to earn that platinum card.    Well, to wrap up, the Dbacks lit it up and it was a more exciting game than expected.  When we left it was a breeze getting out onto Pima, so yeah, if you haven't been, go.

I am a creature of habit and sometimes miss good places while I frequent places I'm familiar with.  I used to go to Firehouse Subs when I was craving a sub, but finally drove on Dobson instead of Alma School and realized there's a Planet Sub over there at Dobson and Germann.  Now that's our goto place for subs.  I still like Firehouse a lot.  Their brisket sub is mouth-wateringly delicious, but every time I go there it's a total C.F. and really crowded and I'm more stressed out when I leave, so I save that one for when I'm already stressed out and sweaty.    The service is always top notch at Planet Sub and I like the daily specials like a $2.50 turkey sub on Tuesday and the double stamp day for the punch card on Wednesdays.  We've tried the Yello Sub, Torpedo, Pesto Bello Combo, Big Dipper, and the Meatball Grinder.  All amazing & made with fresh ingredients on toasty, crusty wheat bread.  I want to try the Smoky Southwest Chicken because that just sounds wonderful.    They are not fast food and definitely worth the wait (which is not long).  I like that we can call the order in and it's ready when we get there.

I'm very happy we finally tried BLD for breakfast.  We arrived around 8:30 and it wasn't busy at all, which is fine by me.  I don't really dig crowds because that usually means there's the potential for loud talkers, drunken sluts, and unsupervised crumbsnatchers.  I'll take peace and quiet where I can get it.  Anyway!  I had the Green Chili Pork Tostada which was a beautiful and flavorful dish.  I should have taken a picture of it, but I'm still Yelp-shy when it comes to taking pics in front of the staff.  Beautifully presented, the pork was tender and plentiful, and I really enjoyed the black bean puree which smoothed out the spicy pico de gallo.  I have mentioned before that I'm a heat pansy, and this dish was good, but a little spicy for me.  Overall I think the flavors blended very nicely.  I brought home half of it and I think the leftovers will make some very nice breakfast burritos tomorrow morning.  Mr. M had the biscuits and gravy, bacon, breakfast potatoes, and eggs sunny side up.  His meal was cooked perfectly as well, and I really like it when onions are fried up with the taters.  I was sticking my fork into his plate more than once, and used one of those potatoes to soak up some of the flavorful broth on my plate.  Delicious!  I enjoyed the B & G, but he said he didn't care for the gravy very much, that there was something sweet about it that he didn't expect that reminded him of hollandaise sauce.  Maybe they got their whisks mixed up.  I dunno, but I liked it.  We watched the chicken & waffles and the meatloaf hash get walked by our booth and I'm looking forward to a return visit to give them a try.    Our server was friendly and fast with refills and the atmosphere was nice.  I like the calming grey color scheme.  The coffee was nothing special to me, but not bad.  Next time I would try one of their specialty coffee drinks.

I feel really lucky to live close to several very good Greek restaurants and I think Cyprus Grill is my favorite.  The staff is always friendly and the food is delicious!  My favorites are the calamari and the chicken souvlaki.  The breading on the calamari is so light and crunchy.  They fry that just right.    The chicken souvlaki always has a wonderful smoky grilled flavor that I can't get enough of.  I should try other things on the menu, because I'm sure they are all good, but I get the chicken almost every time.  My husband has had their gyro and we've shared the Spartan club before and both are great as well.  I almost forgot about the Greek fries!  Oh yeah!  You have to try those all smothered in sauce and seasoning and feta.  Perfect with a cold beer.    I've dined in twice, but now we just do their online ordering and get the food to go so we can save money and go home and drink our own booze, but Cyprus does have some good happy hour specials and I love that they have a good selection of Mediterranean beverages, but they also support the local brewers.    The only thing I would change is I wish when I ordered the souvlaki to go, they wouldn't put the salad in the same container as the hot food.  That's it.  It's not a huge deal because we live so close, but still, it would be nice to not have the lettuce starting to wilt by the time we dig in.   Overall, this is one of our favorite neighborhood places.

4.5/5  This place is really fun and has great food.  I have had it bookmarked forever and finally have been up in their area for a training class so I gave it a try for the first time on Friday.  I took a couple of coworkers with me and we all enjoyed our food.  We called in the order when we left the office and they had it ready when we got there.  I had the mushroom and Swiss burger with pesto on a potato roll.  I love that blending of flavors and my burger was really good, but decided at the time that the next time I would get a double.  The burger isn't really too small for the bun, but they are good, hearty buns and a double would really fill it out well.  The homemade chips are just like I like them, light, crispy, and brown.  A couple of them were soggy, but overall they were very nice.  I got to try an onion ring and knew I wanted to order them the next time around as well.  So...the very next day I brought my husband up to try it out.  We ordered a double and he chose the toppings.  It was something like mushroom, Swiss, bacon, and lettuce, with the onion rings.  I decided to try their brat with chips.  Everything was delicious.  The fresh buns really are a nice touch and we like the fact that you can bring up to 2 beers with you and drink them with the meal, as long as you are sitting inside.  I can easily handle and appreciate that.  The two gals working there are super friendly and helpful and add to the positive experience.    The only reason they aren't a perfect five stars for me is that the burgers do have a pressed look to them that leads me to believe they might have been frozen.  If they did freshly-ground, never-frozen beef for those burgers, they would really be over the top.  Aside from that though, as a whole, they put out some great food in a fun environment with funky album covers, posters, and memorabilia all over the place.  I love Billy Joel with those bedroom eyes staring at me while I'm in the can.  All the reminders of when the best music was created.  I look forward to my next visit.

Absolutely 5-star experience with Wave Cleaning.  Everything was smooth sailing from the online quote, to the emails to confirm the appointment and services with Melissa, to meeting Cesar this morning who cleaned our vacated rental from top to bottom.  He did an excellent job and was there for a little over 4 hours.  If my husband or I ever crack the 6-figure salary range, then I'll have a cleaning service regularly, but until then it's Swiffer city for us.  I would most definitely hire Wave in the future.  Thanks guys!

Mr. M and I chose the day before St. Paddy's to do our celebratin' and one of our stops was here at The Harp.  We took a seat at the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender to take our drink order and see if we wanted menus.  Absolutely.  We are Irish pub fare fiends.  With a Newcastle and a Guinness safely in front of us, we decided to order the Bangers & Mash and the haddock Fish & Chips.  They also give you the choice of cod.  The bangers & mash were quite enjoyable with perfectly grilled sausages, and the whole grain mustard mashed potatoes were a nice surprise.  With the brown gravy and it's mildly oniony goodness, that was a perfect meal.  The fish and chips were delicious as well.  The fish was fried perfectly and light and flaky.  The fries were crisp as well and I couldn't stop stealing them from Mr. M's plate.  Carbo overload, but well worth it.    I took home half the bangers and mash and Mr. M ate them when I wasn't looking.  He's in big trouble.  The service was great.  The beer was great.  The food was great.  We generally like our Irish pubs to be a little more low-ceilinged and dark,  BUT the high, bright room will not keep us from coming back.  Great experience and look forward to returning.

In the past couple of years we've been back to The Harp a few times and always have had a good experience, except for one thing.  We stopped in for a late lunch on 12/20/15 and I've saved the receipt this long to remind me I had to update my review to mention how bad the mussels were.  For $12.99 we got a bowl full of clear, flavorless broth, with some onions sprinkled throughout and about 12-15 sketchy mussels.  Three or four had not been debearded, 2 weren't open, 2 empty shells, and well, it was just the worst 13 bucks I've spent on an appetizer in a long time.  The description says "with white wine (no), onions (some), and herb liquor (what?) broth".  The accompanying bread was cheap and barely warm.  Fibber Magees and Tim Finnegan's are way way better.  Someone from The Harp needs to go check them out.    We didn't send them back because my husband said he would eat them anyway, but after I had to pull the beards out of two I gave up.  Just no.  We also had the chicken and leek pie and the beef, mushroom, and ale pie.  Both of those are good, but the beef pie has a richer flavor.  Marci took great care of us at the bar and made a beautiful Black Velvet for me.  We'll still go back, but no way on the mussels.

Dude, don't eat at Filiberto's.  I do not understand why they are so popular all over the Valley.  Maybe it's good for drunks whose stomachs are so polluted with skunky beer and whose palate has been ruined by smoking cheapass ditchweed, but the food at Filiberto's looks like someone already ate it and they put it on a paper plate.  I tried it twice to be fair and I feel lucky to be alive.

Great big fat delicious gyros for $6.25.  The service is friendly and fast.  Next time I'll take a pic of my food before I scarf it down.  It was a great, quick lunch a couple of days ago.    And as a bonus, there was a 3-yr-old having a meltdown inside the restaurant, screaming bloody murder, a small Croc flung into the corner, tears and snot flying everywhere.  Daddy hauled him outside for a few minutes, and when they came back, that kid was stone cold sober and quiet as a mouse.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.

Mr. M really likes this cigar shop.  He has been there probably 8 times and said the people working there are always helpful and answer his questions.  He has tried a few different cigars, and now has his favorites.    He's not into the whole membership thing, so just buys a few and brings them home.  All I know is whatever he's smoking, they smell good.  I've been around cigars that make my eyes water and my nose run.  Not these.  If it makes him happy, I'm happy.

I was up at 4 a.m. today.  Did a load of laundry, watered the plants, highlighted my hair, did some cleaning, unloaded the dishwasher, cleaned the pool, and patiently waited for my husband to wake up.  At 6:30 I pretended to drop something and woke him up.  I said, "Hey!  Wanna try someplace new for breakfast?!?!?"  He got dressed, put on his shades, and got in the car.  I love that man so much.  My goal was to get to Ncounter right when they open because I have read about how busy they get.    I really liked how pleasant and sunny the restaurant was, and ordering at the counter was easy.  We got the Greek omelet, the basic 2-egg breakfast with bacon, and a mocha.  They have nice sized water cups too.  This time of year I really appreciate that.    My Greek omelet was really nice.  Full of veggies and feta cheese.  Great flavors.  I also enjoyed the rye toast and what tasted like homemade apple cinnamon preserves.  Mr. M's 2 egg breakfast was very good as well.  The bacon was OUTSTANDING!  And I wish I would have shoved the toast aside to get a picture of the potatoes that came with his breakfast.  They were fried or roasted to a nice golden brown and really went well with the egg yolks.    My mocha was delicious as well.  Did I see they use Press coffee?  That totally makes sense.  I loved it.  With two breakfasts and the mocha, the total was $21.62 before tip.    I did happen to notice all the very fit people in the restaurant who looked like they just biked around Tempe Town Lake, or climbed that hill to the east of the restaurant.  I did none of those things.  Maybe next time.

5-star all the way.  In the past couple of months since we've been in this house we were working on bigger projects and as long as the old opener was working, we'd deal with it.  But it was really flaky and would sometimes stick halfway down and the sensor wasn't working to stop it if something was in the way, and when you're moving, something is always in the way.  I also found myself out in the driveway with my arm out the window doing contortions to get the damn opener to kick in and open the damn door.  So frustrating.  I was starting to think it was the metal plate in my head.  Well, enough was enough, and I called MasterCraft this week and it was smooth sailing.  Everything from scheduling, to our tech, Jonathan, to Nigel in the office taking care of the payment.  Easy as could be.  And now we have a nice new opener so I don't have to alienate my new neighbors anymore by sitting out in the driveway cussing.  The new one will open when I'm way down the block!  How nice is that?  Jonathan really took his time explaining the new opener and its features and answered all my questions.  We also talked about options for doors if we ever decide to replace one of those.  Overall I could not be happier.  I feel bad that I had reached out to 2 other companies (who never got back to me) before calling MasterCraft.  Don't even waste time.  Just call these guys.

Best donuts I've had in the metro area so far.  I caught them between the breakfast and lunch rush so had the counter all to myself and they still had a great selection.  The employees were very friendly as well.  When I'm working back in this area I'll be sure to stop in again and try some of the other items on the menu.

The Bagel Man deserves all the rave reviews!  I was up early this morning wondering who was open at 5:30 a.m., and was also looking for a place I've never been and this joint fit the bill.  I had a honey wheat bagel toasted with the honey almond spread and it was delicious!  Warm and chewy and just what my belly needed that early in the morning.  The employees were fast and friendly too.  I've attached photos of their menu as of today.  This would be a perfect stop before a hike or bike ride on South Mountain.  And a great stop for lunch when you're done.  I can't wait to grab the unsuspecting Mr. M and go back.  The only reason I would ever go back to Einstein Bros. was if I was craving a cinn/sugar bagel.

I've tried to figure out how to write this without it turning into an epic diatribe.  Let's see if I can keep it concise.  If money is no object and/or you don't mind going into debt for your animal's care (some of which may be unnecessary) then you will love this place.  I have no doubt any of the 4 doctors are competent, and they also do doggie day care, boarding, and grooming here.  Really quite an operation, BUT I went in thinking I was only going to have to spend around 250 dollars, and got a "treatment plan" in which they wanted almost $1000 that day.  Oh yes....over 900 dollars.    I don't know when things changed at the vet.  Dentists are the same way now.  Maybe it's because there's one on every corner. I went in for a senior cat exam, and two kittens who needed a shot and treated for ear mites.  Dr. O didn't even listen to me when she asked me if the old cat had had the feline leukemia vaccine.  I said yes, I can get those records from home, that test and subsequent vaccine was added on to the "treatment plan" anyway.  $484 just for the old cat alone.  Unbelievable.  If you're not comfortable saying "No", then you will get bent over here.  Seriously.  I am well prepared and can afford to take care of my pets, but getting ignored and then these "treatment plans" which they make you sign......I had to cross about 8 things off their lists.  50 bucks per stool sample for example.  Hey, how about this instead.  I scoop their poop every day.  I'll bring one in if anything changes, ok?  I am way too familiar with how it's supposed to look.    And the baby talk to my animals.....Oh.  My.  God.  It was ridiculous and made me nauseated.  I know I must be in the minority because I treat my pets like animals, not like kids, but good Lord the baby talking by Dr. O to the cats made me embarrassed for her.  Do people actually like that?    I don't know.  After all was said and done I felt like I had been through the wringer when purchasing a car, not just a trip to the vet.  I managed to get what was necessary and still spent $313.  A little high, but not totally out of line for 3 cats.    I agree with others when they mention the rude front desk women.  I wish I would have gotten the gal's name who took my payment because she was awful.  Cold and bordering on mean, and when I asked for a copy of the "treatment plan" (which I was told by the vet tech I would get) she shortly said, "That's what you get today" and handed me the list of what I was actually charged for, not all the other unnecessary items.  Hmm.  Ok Sweet Pea.  I'm fine with that, because I won't be back.   There was also a very nice older gentleman up front with his aged chocolate lab, and he was talking about treatment for his dog, and right in front of me, she loudly said, "Well you know you still have a balance on the account."  Hmmm.  I bet he does.  I felt so sorry for the guy I almost paid his bill for him, but it could be in the thousands of dollars for all I know.     One star because the joint is really clean and they offer a lot of services, and one star because they let me look at one of the ear mites under a microscope.  That was cool.

Mr. M & I found ourselves staring at the open fridge, not liking any of our choices.  I asked him what he was in the mood for and he said "pizza".  Well, I had read about BoomBozz and it was on my list to try so we got there around 1:45 in the afternoon on 12/26.  We have this proclivity to visit restaurants at off hours.  I like to have the bartender all to myself to get the lowdown on drink and food choices.  They know what's good.  And if the bartender ever happens to be a pompous ass, stupid,  or have her cans practically out of her shirt and lying on the bar, I ask for the restroom and leave.  Hence, I rarely go out to eat and drink in Scottsdale.  Anyway, we had a GREAT time at BoomBozz and actually will become regulars now that I've discovered the bike path just to the north of the parking lot.  I did not catch the bartender's name, but he is an absolute asset to the place.  He knows his beers and he can talk about movies and books!  If I wasn't already married.....  We had the Mamma Meatza calzone and the 1/2 chicken prosciutto sandwich and 1/2 field greens salad.  Everything was delicious.  They have great lunch specials for 7 or 8 bucks, and I was impressed that they gave me fries with my sandwich too.  Most joints that do the 1/2 and 1/2 deals don't do that.    For tasty beverages we had the Odell Myrcenary, Breckenridge Vanilla Porter, Kingpin Double Red Ale, and the Oskar Blues Deviant Dale's IPA.  All of which are stellar.  Total bill with tax was $39.34.  The beer menu is outstanding and I can't wait to go back and try more.  When we left BoomBozz we immediately headed to BevMo to pick up some of those beers we had (this is a common practice in our household) and I liked that darn bartender so much, that if BevMo would have had the Grand Canyon seasonal we had discussed I would have bought a bottle and taken it right back to him.  That's the kind of gal I am.

Since my last review we've been back 7 or 8 times.  Still a stellar beer selection.  Still good food.  Still great lunch specials for $7.99.  PJ the bartender is the best and one afternoon got Mr. M to try Fireball something something cider bomb or something.  It was a shot of Fireball whiskey dropped into a pint of Angry Orchard cider.  HOLY MOLEY!  Apple pie in a glass.  As if we needed yet another tasty beverage to bombard our livers with......    Besides the regular amazing variety of craft beers on tap, today we discovered they have guest brews Papago Orange Blossom Ale, which I know is wonderful, and then we tried Oskar Blues Old Chub which is a delicious brown Scotch ale.  Chocolate, coffee, and a hint of smokiness.  I need a nap now.  I've also grown quite fond of the Quattro pizza.  With prosciutto, artichoke hearts, shrooms, and italian sausage it is a great combination.  OH!  And they are selling and filling growlers now, so it's time to dust off my collection and fill 'em up!  GREAT place!!

OK.  Here's what you have to do.  Order the pretzel app with the queso cheese.  Make sure you save a little of the cheese.  Then order the Carnitas Libre pizza and dip the pizza crust IN the leftover queso.  Or, if you want to get really crazy, drizzle the queso on the pizza.  THE.   BEST.  Oh, and get some really great beers with kickass service at the bar.  'Nuff said.

2 or 2.5.  Eh....I don't think I can do it ever again.  I've tried Freddy's 3 times just to be sure and give them a fair shake.  The first bit is some social commentary.  Feel free to move on down to the meat of the review.  (See what I did there.  I did it twice).    Are you bored?  Lonely?  Needy?  Well the new captive audience for you folks can be found in the nearest drive-thru.  Feel free to pull up and order 4 or 5 combos with TONS of modifications, and then add a few more random, single items just to prolong the conversation.  All told, you should be able to get someone's undivided attention for at least 20 minutes.  If you are really feeling in need of attention, please ask the person at the window all kinds of questions about when the mall opens, what stores are inside, and if they have ever tried Famous Dave's.  You could probably stretch that out to a full half hour of attention.    Please ignore the blonde woman behind you mocking you and yelling out, "Are you sure you're finished?  There are 2 items on the menu you didn't order!"  OK.  I've only fantasized about doing that last part, but it's bound to happen if I'm ever in the perfect vortex of PMS, bladder capacity, sleep deprivation, and hunger.  Anyway, I've tried the burgers and dogs and shakes 3 times.  All have been a disappointment for the most part.  The first time I got the patty melt and it was really really greasy, but I was really, really hungry and I ate it anyway and boy oh boy did I pay the price.  Lost 10 lbs. that weekend.  I also ordered a chocolate malt and it was watery and had very little flavor.  Second time I ordered the combo with the regular hot dog and it was ok.  And Mr. M ordered the Freddy's Original double.  The fries were very greasy, but the dog was ok.  I thought about going back for a hot dog, but not a burger.  The burger was so greasy it was inedible.  Mr. M ended up getting a burger from Wendy's.    Then I went back for the 3rd and final time and ordered a dog again with a little mustard and a little relish.  There was a huge amount of relish under the dog and the bun was hard and crumbly.  That didn't stop me from eating the wiener.  You know it.  The ice tea was ok.  The staff has always been friendly, but I just don't think I can do it again.  I have had better.

How much fun is this place?  The metro area needs more of these.  A car wash, gas station, convenience store, wine shop, gift shop, and BBQ café?!?!  What the heck?  Pinch me!  We picked up some great gifts for upcoming birthdays and some funny things for my husband's fishing trip, and a few beverages for the road.  The food I saw looked excellent.  If we weren't on a mission to Cave Creek, we would have lingered longer.  Now I'm looking for a reason to go back.  Great place!

I don't have much new to say, because others have done such a good job describing and taking pictures of the beautiful food and beverage, except this is my new favorite place to day drink.  $5 glasses of wine 11-5?  An interesting and varied wine selection?  I'm there.    Mr. M and I visited last Monday and the weather was beautiful and perfect for enjoying the open air atmosphere at Postino East.  We were taken care of by two friendly servers who I could see helped each other out all over the restaurant.    We shared some bruschetta, a sandwich, and a bottle of riesling.  It could not have been a more perfect visit.  The only thing of note is that just south of this block, Gilbert Road is torn up and blocked off and really annoying.  I hope they are doing something good with that mess.  You have to come at Postino from the north (Guadalupe/Gilbert intersection).  I tried to weave around thru residential areas and that doesn't work.    I can't wait to go back and this will definitely be a place we'll take out of town guests.  Thank you thank you thank you.  *We drove by on 2/11/13 and the construction was cleared out!

I'm sure Sunday morning a lot of folks were up dressed in their best to go to church.   My husband and I, on the other hand, were waiting outside Atl Wings at 5 mins. to 11:00 like a couple of patients with their brand new medical marijuana card waiting for the dispensary to open.    As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the friendly young woman working at the front counter and when I said we'd never been there before she showed us the menu and choice of flavors.  It's a little overwhelming so we chose the seasoned and the parmesan garlic flavors.  Also based on the other reviews we got an order of honey biscuits to try.  While we waited I had to use the restroom and was impressed with how clean it was.  I don't mean just the floor was swept and the sink wiped off.  The WHOLE thing was clean.  How many times do you go into a restaurant bathroom and after you wash your hands you touch either the paper towel dispenser or the door handle and feel something that might be salad dressing?  It might be cheese?  It might be a cluster of infectious bacteria?  Whoever cleans these bathrooms wipes everything down.  That says a lot about the overall cleanliness of the joint.  This place was spotless.  I'll get carpal tunnel if I type about how good the wings were in detail, just suffice it to say they were fried perfectly crisp, while still being moist inside.  I can't wait to try the other flavors.  Both of the ones we had were great!  When I mentioned that it's kind of weird to have wings without beer (on a Sunday no less!!) the woman who took our order said they are working on a liquor license.  That would be great if you are so inclined to have a cold tasty adult beverage with your wings.    We got the cinnamon and powdered sugar (each 50 cents extra) with our biscuits and that was a decadent treat to have honey-drizzled warm biscuits and then sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar on them.  It smelled like my grandma's kitchen on Sunday and they tasted heavenly.    So I think in a way, we did find religion on Sunday.  I'm convinced that if anyone wrote a negative review for this place, they are somehow affiliated with the Long John Silver's right next door, or the Domino's across the street.  Hallelujah for Atl Wings!

My 40+ yr old female body has been going wacko hormonal for Mexican food lately.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Los Favoritos has a 5-star breakfast burrito and I can't stop eating them.  They are $3.95, about 8-inches long, and packed with eggs, meat, and potatoes.  There are several choices, of which I've tried the bacon and the sausage.    Two things really stand out to me.  First, the fillings are all mixed together evenly.  How often do you get a burrito and the eggs are all on one side?  See what I'm sayin?  Then, the bacon is crisp and the filling is not greasy.  How many times do you get a greasy, soggy burrito at other joints?  Way too many.  That is not what you'll find at Los Favoritos.    The staff is friendly and the breakfast burritos are perfection.  If you like things spicy they can juice it up with peppers and hot sauce for you.  I get a little of their red salsa, which is more like a puree, and add a little while I'm eating it.  Livens it up with just the right amount of heat for me.

This business has not closed.  A few months ago the name changed to Papa Chevo's, but everything else is exactly the same.  I tried to update it with Yelp HQ a month or so ago, and they said No mas.  Then I uploaded some pics so hopefully it will get corrected.  It is not closed as Kirk R. mentioned in his review update.  I got some tasty enchiladas there this afternoon.

As I just finished my brisket breakfast taco from Rudy's I realized I really need to write a review for this joint.  I've eaten at Rudy's all over TX and was happy to see they opened one here.  I've always been a huge fan of their moist brisket and the ribs.  Little did I know about the breakfast tacos.  Now they are a new addiction.  For $1.70 you get a fat stuffed taco with egg, cheese, and your choice of smoked meat.  They also have tacos without meat which have fried potatoes instead.  Heaven in a tortilla.  Some of the other Rudy's reviewers would have a nervous breakdown if they ever went to Kreuz Market in Lockhart, TX (which in my opinion is the best smoked meat anywhere).  Kreuz's has signs that say No Sauce No Forks, and you have to sit at picnic tables with strangers!  (gasp!!!)  Our world needs more of the Texas-style good ol' good time to be found at these kinds of BBQ places.  Go to Rudy's, order the smoked meat that your heart desires, or that your stomach is craving, grab a cold beer from one of the ice-filled tubs, make some new friends, and relax.  You won't regret it.

I first discovered Rudy's back in 2006 when I was working in Texas.  Great BBQ at a gas station?!?!?!   Sign me up!!  I can multi-task.  Well, the location in Chandler doesn't have a gas station, which is fine with me.  I love the employees here.  They put up with all kinds of nonsense from oblivious customers and are always friendly and upbeat.    What it does have is some delicious smoked meat.  And very cold beers.  I think there are some sides, but I can't remember them because we go full-on carnivore when we eat there.    I swung in today during my least favorite time of day, the noon hour, but I was in the area, so I thought I'd get some brisket and sausage to go with some delicious smoked gouda I have at home.  The line was almost to the door, which is to be expected, but then I realized that near the front was a group of almost a dozen people, all together, clogging up the works.    My version of this morning's meeting:  "Where should we have lunch?"  11 voices chime in "RUDY'S!!!!"  1 voice squeaks out, "Whataburger."  "OK.  Rudy's it is.  Should we have them cater?"  "NO!!!"  "Should we call ahead?"    "NO!!!"  "Should we look at the menu ahead of time and figure out our orders so only one or two people are at the register?"  "HELL NO!!"  "Should we all go up to the register together, order separately, take all the time in the world, and clog the works up for everybody else?"  "YES!!!  Screw those assholes!"  I think some of that jagoffery I experienced in Nebraska followed me home.  There was some evidence of jagoffery in the parking lot too with a gray pickup and small trailer for a solar panel business taking up FOUR spots during the lunch hour.  Could have done with two.  Nope.  I'm taking four.    Jagoff.

I've been thinking about this joint for a few months since I started yelping and read the reviews.  Thank you thank you thank you to the reviewer who mentioned the toasted coconut donut.  Holy moley that is good.  I also tried a twist with sugar.  Very good and fresh donuts.    I stopped in around 3 p.m. on a weekday and I was the only one in the store and was impressed with how clean it was.  I won't be back often because these things aren't good for me and if I'm going to have excess calories, I'd rather they be alcohol-related, but the next time I'm craving a donut, Golden Donuts is what I'm going to hit.

Super fresh.  Super service.  And super fuel for holiday shopping.  Delicious donuts!  And as a bonus they threw in about a half doz donut holes for free.  These plus a cup of coffee and I'm invincible!!!

Oh yeah!  Gelati layered with chocolate custard and the root beer Italian ice.  It will taste almost like a Tootsie Roll, if you like that kind of thing.  That's my favorite.  We also tried the gelati with mango ice and vanilla custard.  That was perfect on a hot day.  The mango ice is not too sweet and had a true mango flavor.  We were also eye-balling the sign with their frozen lemonades.  That and some good booze would make a heck of a delicious poolside cocktail!

Big beautiful new Sprouts!  Love all the space in this store compared to the other ones.  Everything was easy to find and the employees were helpful.  The produce section is beautiful, as usual.  I had some trouble finding the artichokes, but there was an employee right there to guide me.  My only beef is with the way the cash registers are set up.  Unless you are on the end, you will be butt-to-butt with another patron.  I have been hit by toddlers and knocked over by cheap birkin knock-offs when their self-centered owner swings around to take stuff out of the cart.  I would think with designing a new store they would have put more room between the registers.  If you get stuck behind one of the Widettes and their screaming brats, you are S.O.L.  Might as well wait until they toddle on out unless you are lucky enough to find an end register open.    I live within walking distance of another Sprouts, but I am glad I checked this one out.  If I'm in the area again I would definitely stop in.

On one of our afternoons of day drinking, we realized we were probably going to have to call a cab anyway, so why not swing in here for a tequila flight?  We sat at the bar and the bartender greeted us right away and described some of the offerings on the tequila menu.  I had mezcal on the brain because I wanted to investigate it further, so we ordered a flight.  Our server also brought us some chips and salsa and the two salsas were very tasty.  The green one was sweet, smoky, and spicy, and the red one had a nice fire-roasted flavor.  Upon delivery of the flight the bartender explained the 3 different tequilas, and the palate cleansers.  The green one with pineapple juice, jalapenos, cilantro, and something else is outstanding.  I want one of those for breakfast.    After trying all 3 mezcal tequilas, I still liked it, but that's some powerful stuff and I was pretty sure I could feel some hair starting to sprout on my chest.  Oh baby!    Overall we weren't big spenders, but we were treated very well and I enjoyed the whole visit.  Their menu has some very interesting items like crawfish & pecan hush puppies and the brunch sounds wonderful.  We'll definitely be back.

OK I'm whipping out 5 stars for the brunch carne asada and eggs alone.  The carne asada was fantastic!  When they sit the plate down, it looks like a seasoned NY strip.  What it is, is some of the most tender and flavorful carne asada you will ever have.  I could stop right there.  That's all you need to know...OH and it's only $12.50.  But also when we were there for brunch, my husband ordered his usual bacon, eggs, and taters, which was a great deal as well for $7.50, and while he did enjoy that, he said he wished he would have ordered the carne asada after he tried a few bites of my breakfast.    We had a couple of brunch mojitos ($5 each) and tried the prickly pear lemonade, also 5 bucks during brunch.  I didn't catch the bartender's name, but he was awesome.  So friendly and fun to talk to, without hovering over us.  This is definitely a favorite brunch spot.  Go get some of that carne asada!

I tell ya, I've eaten here twice and will go back, but it's been interesting each time.  Most of the "interesting" vibe centers around the servers.    The first time, Mr. M and I both had regular bacon and egg breakfasts with an added order of B & G.  The place is named Biscuits for God's sake, so we must try the B.    The bacon is spectacular.  It was cooked perfectly and tasted and smelled how a BBQ smokehouse does.  Loved that.  Everything else was fine, except for the B & G.  It must have been an exception, because other reviewers have raved about it, but ours had 2 hard, dry biscuits.  No amount of gravy is going to soften those up in the 2 minutes it's at our table.  And speaking of the gravy, I could taste an overwhelming floury, pasty flavor and texture to the gravy.  My guess is someone was over-baked themselves that morning and made a thin batch of gravy and then went overboard with the flour or cornstarch or roux or whatever they use to thicken it.   I'm chalking that up as a fluke and will try those again.    Our server on the first visit was just straight up weird.  She acted like she didn't want to get too close to the table and would stand behind my left shoulder to talk to us, then would hustle away after we gave our orders.  Very strange.    The second time was a great visit overall, other than our server, Richard.  We were the only table seated outside at that time and it was a lovely sunny morning just before the heat ratcheted up.   When Richard greeted us he was very friendly and all smiles.  He took our order and that's the last we saw of him until it was check time.    They give you very teeny water glasses and those were empty in no time.  I also had a café mocha and that was very tasty and pretty as well.  I would definitely have that again.  The lack of water refills was annoying, but if I get annoyed enough I'll get up and go ask for more.     The avocado benedict was absolutely perfect.  The English muffin was toasted and then the eggs were cooked about medium.  Runny yolk, but not watery.  And the avocado was fresh, creamy deliciousness.   Fresh tomatoes as well that tasted like they were from the garden.  That meal was so good I'm going to have a hard time trying something else when I go back.    Mr. M got a regular bacon and egg breakfast but added a pancake so we could give that a try.  Everything he ordered was delicious as well.  We were eating kind of slowly for a change and just enjoying the morning and the weather when a busboy came on out and didn't say a word, but reached over us to attempt to grab the plate with a half-eaten pancake.   Oh no.  Oh no.  You do not want to risk losing a digit by doing that.  I was kind of shocked he didn't say a word, and I politely informed him we weren't finished yet.  I asked for more water, but never got it.  Ten minutes later here comes long-lost Richard, all smiles, presenting us with the check and thanking us profusely for coming in....laying it on pretty thick.  Richard, do you think I was born yesterday?  Your performance today earned you about a 12% tip, maybe less if I wasn't in such a good mood.  Servers should always come back and check about 2 minutes after the food has been dropped, and then about 10-15 minutes later and have their eyes open for drink refills.  At a minimum.  I learned it and lived it.  You can too.

We bought our house a year ago and knew we had a nice A/C unit, but I wanted to get it checked out before it gets hot this year.  I submitted a request through their website and the next day Tonya called me to set up an appointment.  James was at our house this morning and called ahead to let me know when to expect him.  I can't say enough nice things about him.  He was very helpful and really listened to all my questions.  He also offered suggestions without being pushy at all.  I did opt to have one thing fixed today that really needed to be done, and he was very efficient with the whole process, without making it feel rushed.  I'm so glad I checked Yelp when I was looking for an HVAC company because the 5-star rating for Dukes of Air is spot on.

Monday was quite a day of day drinking and eating.  Mr. M & I had already hit two other places and then we decided to head much closer to home and try Nando's.  I've been curious since they started remodeling the place, and driving by at night the white lights on the patio & inside looked very inviting.  This location is exactly that:  inviting and even though the building is large, there are smaller rooms inside and the brick interior makes it feel cozy.  The staff could not be more friendly.  I think I saw everyone smiling which is always appreciated.  We started with 2 of the Cabo margs with curacao which were large and delicious.  The chips and salsa were good too.  I used to think I liked my salsa more like pico de gallo, but now I'm gettin' into the salsas that are more of a puree.  Nando's salsa had a very nice blend of flavors.  They gave us the mild/medium one, and then a small container of salsa they said was very spicy.  We're both a couple of heat pansies and didn't try that one, but it smelled good.  Then Mr. M had the Pollo Rico and I had the #10 which was with 2 beef flautas, black beans, and rice.  Now I know this isn't really authentic but both dishes were flavorful and enjoyable.  Both meats, the chicken in the Rico and the beef in my flautas were very tender.  As others have mentioned the portions are HUGE.  We left with mucho leftovers which I'm always happy to warm up the morning after and throw a fried egg on top of.  And I froze all the Spanish rice and will use that in a tex mex soup that I make.  I mentioned in another review today that I've been having major cravings for Mexican food lately and this place fit the bill.  I would definitely go back mainly because the atmosphere is so inviting and because it's a good value for the money.  They also do flights of tequila.  I will most definitely be back to try some of those.  Glad to see a Mexican joint within walking distance.  Or shuffling distance.

Conversation between me and the young lady working the first register:  Her:  "Good morning!  What can we get for you today?"  Me:  "How about 4 bagels to go, not sliced, just as is: one honey wheat, cinnamon sugar, good grains, and pumpernickel."  Her:  "OK.  I've got a cinnamon sugar and a poppy seed and what else did you want?"  Me:  "No, no poppy seed.  A honey wheat, cinnamon sugar, good grains, and pumpernickel."    Her:  "OK.  I've got 4 bagels for you, cinnamon sugar, honey wheat, poppy seed, and what was the last one?"  Me:  "No poppy seed please.   Pumpernickel and good grains."    Her:  "Did you want those sliced?"    Me:  "No thank you."  And now in SERIOUS disbelief I'm having this conversation and just want to get my bagels and gtfo.    She finally passes the bag to the cashier and the cashier reads back the contents to me, "OK, I've got a cinnamon sugar, good grains, honey wheat, and poppy seed."  Me:  "Did you just say poppy seed?"  Her:  "Yes."  Me:  "No.  No poppy seed please.  Could you take that one out and put a pumpernickel in it's place?"    I finally got the correct bagels, paid, and left.  I seriously think I was in the Twilight Zone.  Going to The Bagel Man from now on.

I seem to remember when I lived in Florida 10+ years ago that Longhorn was its own chain, wasn't it?  Stock symbol was LOHO.  That's fun to say.  Now they are part of the Darden Group.  Hmmm.....well I like the Yard House and would like to try Seasons 52 and The Capital Grille, but I think Red Lobster is a travesty.  I did a case study on the Darden Group years ago, and I'm not sure how I feel about Longhorn being part of it.  BUT.....where was I?  I should be writing a review.    We had a great experience last night.  Our server, Keith, I believe was also the bartender and he was working his butt off.  He lets people know he'll be right with them, which is always appreciated, and he got our drinks right out to us and took our order quickly.  The place was starting to fill up and he had the bar area plus a few booths and he was all over it.  He did a great job.  And I have to admit I loved it when he got after some of the other staff for piling their ramekins, extra napkins, and misc. other items on the end of his bar.  You go Keith!  Get after those knuckleheads!  We had limited time so we just shared a side salad, the loaded baked potato soup, and the white cheddar & bacon stuffed filet entree.  Oh my.  That steak was very flavorful and cooked a perfect medium rare.  Here's the description on their menu:  A tender Flo's Filet stuffed with aged white cheddar and applewood smoked bacon, served over a savory brown herb sauce.  Delicious.  The vegetable medley side was very nice and fresh as well and included snow peas, squash, and broccoli.  Today I will be drinking 2 kale smoothies and taking extra fish oil tabs, but it was worth it.      When we mentioned to Keith we had a concert to hit, he got the check taken care of right away.  Overall we had a very nice visit and I would be happy to go back.

We have Julia's not opening on time (I still love that place) to thank for making our way to Over Easy.  The reviews are kind of mixed but we had a solid breakfast this morning.  Arriving around 7:30, there were only a couple of tables occupied and we decided to sit at the bar and watch TV, and also watch a fascinating machine that rolls the oranges on through to make fresh squeezed OJ.  Love that and wish I could drink OJ.    I had the Hopple Popple ($9.50) which they usually make with scrambled eggs, but I asked if they could scramble everything but the eggs, and instead put some over easy eggs on top.  Our server said, "Sure.  No problem".  I had the marble rye toast with mine.  My husband got the 2 egg breakfast with bacon, hash browns & sourdough toast. ($8.00)    I had my mind set on ordering the waffle dogs anyway, just to try them.  An order of 3 is $8.50, but the specials board said we could get one for $3, so that's what we did instead.  Everything was really delicious.  Those waffle dogs are like a funnel cake wrapped around a sausage.  Very nice.  I really enjoyed my Hopple Popple with all the yolk mixed in with the scramble.  I got a bite of the bacon from Mr. M and that was really nice as well.  Cooked perfectly and slightly smoky.  The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the coffee.  Kind of bitter without any rich flavor.  I might try something else next time.  Danica took great care of us at the bar and the total with tax was $24.79.  We had a great breakfast and there were some other interesting choices on the menu.  We'll definitely be back.

We just bought a house that needed some serious attention to the yard, and I messaged 2 different highly-rated landscaping companies on Yelp, and Jeremy responded very quickly and said he was in the area and could stop by to give us an estimate.    I got a very thorough email from him just a couple of hours later with an estimate, along with a couple of different options if we wanted to remove a plant or just trim it back.    The price was very reasonable and we moved ahead with an appointment for this past Saturday morning.  Waldo and his uncle (really wish I would have gotten the uncle's name...he was a riot...so funny) showed up 10 minutes early and just dug in, getting right to work and got 2 very large trees trimmed and dug out an old very large cactus that had grown up under and in the side of the house and the fence.  Waldo also gave us some free advice on other plants in the yard.  He was great to talk to, and Jeremy followed up by email to see how things were going.  We are really happy with the work they did and will definitely call them for future tree and plant trimming needs.  On a side note, the other company I had contacted reached out to me the following day and when I let them know that Jeremy had already contacted us, that other person said, "You're in good hands with him".  I thought that was really nice to hear, especially from a competitor.  Thank you Yelpers for steering me in the right direction!  All of the highly-rated reviews are completely justified.  They do a great job!

Well how things can change.  Around the first of October I sent an email to Cahill Landscaping in regards to finally getting rid of our termite-infested tree in the front yard.  I did tell them in the email that there was no rush and was wanting to set something up for the weekend of the 10th/11th.  I got a bonus at the end of the first week in October and wanted to use part of it to get rid of that tree.  I got a call from Alan on Monday the 5th and we set up a time (2 p.m.) for him to stop by the house on the afternoon of the 6th.  My husband took a half day off of work and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  No call.  No show.    My husband called him later that afternoon and finally got a call back and Alan apologized and said there was a scheduling mistake.  Yeah.  No kidding.  He also said he would call back the next day to reschedule.  No call from Alan.  No call.  No problem.  Thankfully there are lots of tree service companies to contact.  I think the most annoying thing is not getting a call.  People take time off of work, to sit and wait.  To not even call is completely irresponsible.  That time could be better spent on vacation or something.  Anything, rather than waiting on a business that can't bother to call or show up.

I'm usually pretty long-winded, but no need in this case.  We had a great visit on March 16th for the following reasons:  The beer selection.  Their own brews are great, but they have some guest taps that provide some very interesting and adventurous choices.  Brews like O'Dell Myrcenary.  The shrimp satay.  This is a wonderfully prepared dish.  Two skewers of 3 very large bacon-wrapped shrimp each, grilled to perfection with a light garlic tomato compote, couscous, and nice sesame stir-fried vegetables on the side, although I think the addition of something green like snow peas or sugar snap peas to the vegetables would add to the appeal.  Justin the bartender.  GREAT service.    Can't wait to go back.

We thought we were going to Tom's BBQ, but recently this changed over to Bourbon Street and since Mr. M and I were starving, we thought what the heck.  I have mixed feelings about this review so I'm just going to break it down.  The location still has BBQ and added a Cajun/Creole aspect to the menu.  We were greeted right away by a friendly young man who pointed us towards the newly remodeled bar.  It looks great!  It used to be kind of a short bar along one wall.  Now they've extended it out and added some sexy lights that I heard change colors, but were green this afternoon, and added a foot rest and hooks for ladies to hang their purses on.  Very nice improvement over the old layout.  The bar seating was almost full so we sat at a 4-top nearby and were completely ignored for 10 minutes or so.  What looked to be manager or owner types (couple - she with blonde hair, he with bald head and thick black glasses) were standing just outside the kitchen surveying the restaurant and didn't notice us at all.   They did notice those near them playing cards.  Also the bartender and a server just walked on by, even though I gave them my best German penetrating stare.    Finally a nice gal came by and asked if we'd been helped yet.  We said, "No" and she chewed the bartender out a bit for not telling her there was someone new.  She took our drink order right away.  They have added to the tap selection, a few more Four Peaks brews and Corona Light.  Nothing that gets me too excited.  I had a Dos Equis Amber and Mr. M had the Four Peaks IPA.  I ordered the shrimp dinner with mac and cheese, instead of cole slaw, and fries.  Mr. M had the 3 meat BBQ platter (pulled pork, pork ribs, and brisket) with fries and red beans and rice.  Here's where I really need to break it down.  The ribs were tender, moist, smoky, and had a very nice flavor.  PERFECT.  Our server said they are using a mojo rub.   I dunno...but that's what I want when I go back.  Ridiculously good. 5/5 The brisket was dry and only slightly smoky, but the burnt ends of two pieces were really good.  I would probably not order the brisket again. 2/5 The pulled pork was delicious.  Seems to me that pork is probably the specialty here. 4/5 The red beans and rice were fantastic.  It's hard to find good red beans and rice outside the bayou and these were smoky and very good with what I think was pieces of shredded pork mixed in.  Delicious.  5/5 My mac and cheese was okay, but could have been a little cheesier.  3/5 The shrimp were very good with their light batter-dipped breading.  Loved those too, just didn't get enough of them.  5/5  The fries.    The fries.  Tasted like catfish.  And it's really too bad.  They look like fresh cut potatoes, and were cooked to a perfect, crisp golden brown.  They tasted like a fish tank.   When I mentioned to our server that really everything was cooked perfectly, but the fries taste like catfish, she said, "I know.  I know.  I hear it all the time, and on fish fry Fridays they all taste like fish."  Damn.  Separate your freakin' fryers.  Not doing so is either lazy, OR if you fry a lot of taters in the fish grease, it will make the grease last longer, but it will make your fries taste like fish.  Especially catfish.  Separate your fryers.  Fries: 1/5.  I wouldn't order them again.  Sad too, because they looked good.  Tasted bad.  Then for desert he had some Dewars & water and I had some Jameson & water.  Drinks were delivered promptly and reasonably priced.  I would come back again for the ribs, red beans & rice, shrimp, and possibly the mac & cheese.  Not the fries.  *UPDATE I got a msg from Chef Terry on 4/3/13 that now they have a fryer dedicated to fries only.  Yahoo!  Can't wait to go back!

Mr. M and I have been here a few times now and I would say overall we've had good experiences.  The great:  the golden wings and the onion rings.  Totally addictive and I could go back there anytime just for those.  In fact, we were there for the last ASU game and there was no talking.  Just eating until we were fighting over the last onion ring.  I distracted him while pretending to dust crumbs off my cleavage and snagged it.  Yes!  The good:  We've never had an issue with servers.  Always friendly and generally quick with refills, drink orders, and the check.  Mr. Erik was the best, but no complaints about anyone.  I also really enjoyed the pepper jack focaccia, the mushroom swiss burger, and the fish and chips on various occasions.  And they have one of my favorite beers on tap, Alaskan Amber, so I am good.  They also made us a mean dirty Ketel One martini one night.  The beer selection is ok, but what they call craft beers are generally not craft beers. We have so many great local breweries, hit them up for some more choices.  Note to management:  go drink at Papago Brewing and Boulders on Broadway and let their beer selections inspire you.  You can still keep the weak, yellow, fizzy, farty beers on tap for the unadventurous.    The bad:  the BBQ shrimp app.  Weird chemical-like flavor.  And one night we had a good salad with healthy romaine and fresh vegs, and one night we had the bagged iceberg lettuce salad that tastes like what?......Plastic.  Yuck.  A little inconsistent on a couple of items we tried.    We need to try the pizza and pay more attention to the HH specials.  They have some great deals every day of the week.  Oh now I'm thinking about those wings and O rings.  Time to go back!

About 3 months ago my husband & I met Kris at one of the home shows at the University of Phoenix stadium.  We really enjoyed talking with him & showed him a picture of the old rusty pool filter & system that came with our house when we bought it last year.  He showed us some material on Pentair's system & after further research, it sounded like this would be a good way to go.  We liked talking with Kris, and we liked Pentair's products & efficiency philosophy.  We also wanted to convert the pool over to a salt-based system, so it was a great time to just replace everything.  I met with Kris at our house so he could give us an estimate.  We talked about the filter and pump system and then also some ideas to replace & expand some of the decking, put in a drain, and a hot tub.  He had some great ideas and showed me some cool examples on his computer.  At no time did I feel pressured or rushed to make a decision.  It was actually fun to visualize what we could do with the backyard.  That's going to be our big project in 2017.  Kris sent me an estimate and my husband looked it over and we decided that we would go ahead and replace everything he suggested for around $4200.  He also mentioned there is a $100 SRP rebate and he would email us some info about how to get that.  When we talked about scheduling I let him know that I was off for the next couple of weeks before I start a new job, so if they could do it sometime soon, that would be perfect.  He said he wasn't sure, but didn't think they could do it quite that soon.  That was fine, I just let him know that then they would have to contact my husband for scheduling after that.  My husband works 5 minutes away and they could work it out with him.  I gave Kris my husband's cell# as well and 50% for a deposit.  Fast forward to my first day of work, I get a call from Janelle at the Tribal Waters office wanting to schedule the installation.  When I had a break I called her back and asked if she had my husband's cell# because they would need to call him to schedule.  I have no idea from week to week what his meeting schedule is like.  I gave her his # and she called him to schedule it.  She kept mentioning that no one had to be there while they do the work.  And we both mentioned that no, someone will be there every time we have someone we don't know at our house.  First of all, that's just common sense.  Second of all, the equipment is like having a small computer attached to the pool pump and we would like to know how to use it.   Now Kris had told me this is typically done in 2 parts.  First the new equipment would be installed, then the electrical work and programming of the equipment.  He set the expectation that the whole thing is usually done in one day, but sometimes takes another half day just to coordinate the techs.  That's fine.    It actually ended up taking 5 separate visits over 9 days.  The equipment, minus the chlorinator, was installed on a Monday.  On Thursday the electricians came out and connected the power to the system.  When my husband asked them if they would be showing him how to program it, he was told they don't do that.  So then he called the office back to find out when the system will be programmed and was told someone would be out Friday morning to get it going, and would also be bringing the salt and the chlorinator.    On Friday morning, the tech comes by with the salt and the chlorinator, and is looking for the data cable and asked my husband if the tech who did the installation on Monday left the data cable.  No cable to be found.  They put the salt in the pool & the tech said he would go see if he could find a data cable.  At this point the pump has not been running since Monday.  At that time the tech manually configured the pump really quickly just so the pump would be running.  The tech returned the following Monday with a data cable which turned out to be the wrong one.  He came back on Tuesday with the correct cable & finished the installation & programming of the equipment.  So my husband had to leave work 5 different times for a total of approximately 20 hours.  He said that the tech programming the machine went so quickly it was impossible to understand what he had done & he seemed in a hurry to leave.  He thought that with the owners manual he'd be able to figure it out.  Well he has some questions & we can't get anyone to call us back to answer those questions.  And we have heard nothing about the rebate.  This past week Janelle called me asking when we were going to pay the other half of what we owed.  Our understanding was that the same credit card that we did the deposit on would be charged for the final amount.  One of the techs had told her my husband said he would call in to make the final payment.  That conversation did not take place.  To sum it up, we are highly disappointed in the complete lack of organization and customer service.  They have not been responsive to our questions & there has been no follow-up.

Salut is great.  Really great.  I've had it bookmarked forever, and finally when a friend was visiting from St. Louis I suggested stopping here for dinner on Thursday night before we drove on up to the art walk in Scottsdale.    We had the hummus nachos to start, a delicious Old Fashioned for me, and a couple of glasses of house pinot grig for her.  She had something healthy like the quinoa bowl or something for her entrée...I don't know...I wasn't really paying attention because I had the malbec burger and that was perfect.  The burger was full of flavor and I think they must grind them up fresh because it was so moist and tender.  The bun holds up well, and with the shrooms, caramelized onions, and provolone, that was a fantastic burger!    Chris was our server, and when we were trying to guess where he was from due to his accent, I finally just asked him.  He said, "Cyprus", and oh my God, my dining companion then just started talking to him in Greek and they had a whole back and forth thing.  I had no idea what they were saying, but it was pretty cool to witness.  He said he rarely runs into someone he can converse with like that.  I didn't want to tell him she only learned Greek to meet men on her vacations!  BAHAHAHA!  I'm just kidding.    No I'm not.  She has a boyfriend on every island.  So then I had to take my Mr. back this morning for brunch.  It just doesn't get much better than this for sure.  We started with the hummus nachos, because you should, you really should.  He then had the Morning burger and I ordered the chicken & waffles.  We went halvsies on everything and it was a great brunch.  I think their burgers might be the best I've had in this city so far.  It's a close contest between them and Fibber Magees/Skeptical Chymist's rasher burger.    A medium rare juicy burger with cheese, bacon, AND an egg?  Yep.  Heaven!  The waffle was so nice and light, perfectly fried chicken, and the cinnamon butter with the syrup is a nice touch.    He had a tripel and I had their coffee, which was fantastic as well.  Lovely, rich flavor.  That brunch is leaving me fat and happy for the entire day.  I can't wait to go back.  Chris was our server again today and he is really wonderful.  Attentive and funny without hovering over us too much.    The only thing I don't like is the music tends to have a lot of thumping bass, and I just don't care for that.  Especially at the end of a long day, after dealing with my high maintenance boss, I really don't want dance music thumping in my brain.  And the music was a little aggressive at brunch.  I think that belongs after 9:00 p.m. when the youngsters are all coming out, and the old men who like to hit on youngsters, and they are looking for someone to rub up against for the night.  Not really the right music for brunch or happy hour in my opinion, BUT that won't keep me away.  Stellar place!  Now that we've been, we'll be back many more times.

I got lucky because Mr. M had a weekday off so we decided to check this place out, and I needed to do a return or exchange at the Under Armour store as well.  The reason I say I got lucky is I have a thing about shopping on the weekends.  Particularly Saturdays.  I don't do it.  I don't need or want that stress in my life.    To visit the outlets on a Friday morning was heavenly.  Almost no people around to annoy me, although we narrowly avoided some crazy broad in a hurry using her double stroller to carve her route.  They need driving tests for those things.  Anyway, we visited the UA store and took care of business.  The young man working there was all over it and had our exchange started for us so that when we got to the register after doing a little browsing, he only had to add one more item I grabbed, swipe my card and we were outta there.  We decided to wander around and noticed a good assortment of stores.  I look forward to going back to check out Columbia, Merrill, Kitchen Connection, Book Warehouse, etc, but we didn't feel like doing much more shopping.  Just strolling.  I did make one more stop.  If you've read some of my reviews you may know I'm also a road warrior and am in many different hotels.  Embassy Suites tend to use bath products from Crabtree & Evelyn with the Citron scent.  I like it, but whenever I've gone into a regular C & E store, the prices make me sound like Ryan Reynolds' character from Waiting, "WHAT THE F**K EVER!!"  I'm not paying that for soap.  However, the C & E outlet has most of these products for half off, so I was able to get a gift basket with 3 Citron full-sized products: lotion, hand treatment, and shower gel for $25 instead of $50.    Now I can treat myself and smell real pretty too, without breaking the bank.  I look forward to a return visit to this outlet mall.  On a weekday.

Merry Christmas to me at the Calphalon store!  Buy two get two free offers on utensils, baking pans, and knives.  I only went in there for a steamer/pasta pot and came out with all kinds of goodies for a great price!    Mr. M left me unattended while he went in the Under Armour store.  I started to feel guilty about the pile I was accumulating, so when he found me, I gave him my best, "Honey, you're the knife expert....what do you think?"  Big wink here.   Then some of the $$$ spent was all him!  Yeah.  I'm wily like that.    Next, he'll be a Dutch oven expert.  ;-)    The two ladies that helped us were THE BEST!  One gal is truly a knife expert and answered all my questions.    We cruised through the Nike store because Mr. M likes the Nike free running shoes, but the colors are just God awful anymore.  Are you telling me dudes wear neon pink and blue shoes?  Teal and gold shoes?  Wtf ever!!  Their shoes look so cheaply made anymore.  We'll wait on that one and go to a real running store.    Overall, I love this outlet mall, but you'll never catch me here on a weekend.

I've had this place bookmarked forever, and I'm so glad they decided to mail out menus.  I've been keeping that bright yellow menu on the kitchen island to remind me to go check this place out.  Finally yesterday, I made it.  I arrived around 11:30 and had the place all to myself for awhile.  The woman who took my order at the counter was very gracious and answered my questions about the spice level of a couple of the dishes.  I decided to order the po po platter ($7.99) which has 2 pieces of each coconut shrimp, potstickers, crab puff, spring roll, and fried wonton.  Some of my favorite fried things and they were all delicious.  Lightly fried and not greasy at all.  I ate half and brought the rest home.  They do have some lunch specials that are $5.95 and $6.95, but I opted for the Cantonese chow mein, house special with shrimp, chicken, and beef. ($9.50)  When she brought this dish to the table it was piping hot and the steam off of it smelled fantastic.  I sat there with my hot tea and just drank it in.  Perfect comfort food for a gloomy, rainy day.  As I dug in I enjoyed how tender the meats were and the mild, rich brown sauce.  I also really liked the edge of crispy noodles and that they were soft underneath.  It was a great lunch all around.  Another couple came in and he commented on how good what I was eating looked and smelled.    I brought 2/3rds of it home and my husband and I enjoyed the leftovers last night.  I look forward to a return visit and trying more items on their menu.  No complaints.  It was a perfect lunch.

Huge fan of the food, not so much the prices and the service.  I've had such good service for quite awhile, I'd almost forgotten what it's like to get an apathetic server.  Get it together, woman!  At least act like you care.  The mighty meaty pizza was really good, full of delicious meaty toppings, and I love the crust!  Yeasty and wheaty and really delicious.  But $21.59 for a medium?  Really?  I think I blasphemed for the first time here.  Then the oven-roasted wings were very tasty as well.  Hot and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  $10.49 for 10?  Over a buck a piece?  Second bad set of words uttered here.  They have a fantastic beer selection.  The server asked me if I wanted a glass with the bottle of beer I ordered and I declined.  My husband had ordered a beer in a can (we didn't know that at the time), and she didn't offer him a glass.  Weird.  Just a preference thing, but beer in a can tastes much better from a glass.  No tinny overtones.  We each had 2 beers and all were $6.50 each except for the Belgian beer in a can that was $5.50.  All in it was $61.82 after tax, before tip.  Blaspheming continued here.  Our server was really almost nonexistent and not engaged with us as far as talking about the food and beers and even said she doesn't bother to learn the beer list because it changes so much.    Next time we'll try happy hour so we can afford to eat and drink here, and we'll sit at the bar to maybe get good service.  The place is huge and I like the eclectic décor all over the place.  The outdoor patio and bar seating looked very inviting too.  Maybe we'll have a better experience the next time around.  **Update.  After hearing from the owner just a short time after I posted my review, I'm going to add a star.  I am completely impressed with a business owner that can approach a less-than stellar review with good questions and feedback.  That makes a huge difference.

We were going to make a return trip to the Nellis location and then I noticed they have a 2nd one now, which was much closer to where we were staying.  On Sept 3rd we ventured over for an early dinner, and I was really impressed with their new space.  It's got high ceilings and a cool bar right in the middle with lots of taps, but still has that dark and relaxing feel to it that the other location has.  We started with the beer bites with a stout and a honey wheat beer.  Each of those were 5 bucks and really hit the spot.  Kimberly took great care of us and would frequently stop by just to see if we needed anything.  For the main meal I ordered the Mirror Pond brats, no bun, and Mr. M ordered the grilled cheese with green apple and bacon & onion rings for the side.  That grilled cheese and o rings were just as good as I remember.  5 stars!  And the brats were really delicious and full of flavor.  The kraut on the side seemed like it came from a can and was really bland.  I would challenge them to make some fresh kraut like the Germans do.  That would really make that meal.    All in we spent $41 before tax and tip.  Not too bad at all.  I know there are many places I should try in Vegas, but every time we go back I have to visit Aces & Ales.  We always have a great time.

I've been reading all the reviews about this place, and had it bookmarked for months.  Well, on Saturday Mr. M and I felt like goofing off and driving around aimlessly and I decided to go on a hot dog tour.    We started here and decided to adopt the attitude of "when in Rome" and ordered what appeared to be the house specialty, The Detroit Coney Combo with the hot dog and onions and mustard and chili and the loose ground beef all in one big pile of goodness.    First, the dude working the register has more patience than I ever would because first timers have no idea how to order here and it can be a little overwhelming in the beginning.  We got to listen to him explain things a couple of times to the group in front of us, so when he got to me, I was ready.    We shared the Detroit Coney combo and the fresh cut spiral cut fries, which come in a huge serving by the way, and I'm pretty sure they sprinkle them with crack because those are totally addictive!  Fried perfectly and absolutely delicious.  I was a little nervous that the onions and chili on the combo would come back and haunt me later, but they did not.  Everyone played nice in my belly and the whole experience was thoroughly enjoyable.  Combo, fries, and fountain drink was $9.18 with tax.  I'll be back for sure.

I have to thank Angels Trumpet Ale House and Pomo for being closed on Monday nights for us trying Pizza People Pub.  We had such a good time the first time that we returned two days later.  My husband and I met up with our buddy Tim S. prior to the St. Louis Cardinals games and were looking for pizza.  Pizza People Pub was in the back of my mind because I had read some good reviews for this place from Monica O. and Jon H.    The 5-star review starts with easy, free parking and then a great atmosphere.  The decor and furniture are some of the coolest I've seen in a long time.  Love the chairs.  We were greeted and seated right away.    In two visits we tried the monkey bread, spud fingers, and pigs in blankies for apps, and four different pizzas: Testosteroni, the Manny, the Hottie, and the Pig N Chick.  All the pizzas were very fresh and flavorful with a perfect yeasty crust.  I think my favorite pizza was the Testosteroni, but they were all great.  All the apps were delicious as well.  And don't get me started on the $4 Drink of the Day.  What a great deal!  The first one we tried on Monday was the Basil Mojito and that was really refreshing and light.  I love the fresh basil.  Then on Wednesday we had the Cucumber Rickey and it was very nice as well.  Those $4 drinks come in a pint glass and are a great deal!  Brandon took great care of us on Monday and Beki was really friendly and funny on Wednesday.  Overall I can't think of anything I didn't love about this place.  The food, service, and prices are all perfect.  I am trying to think of a reason to be in that area again soon so I can try some more menu items.  I think we'll go back and cheer for the home team against the stinky Dodgers.  Except for Chase Utley.  He's not stinky.

Ooh.  I may have a new addiction.  It's been awhile since a new fast food concept  has blown me away, and Fired Pie has done it.  The staff is friendly, there are a lot of choices for toppings, everything was fresh, and I love that they have fresh mushrooms with the water already cooked out of them, and fresh mozzarella.  I love those gooey glops of cheese on my pizza!    Mr. M and I shared a pizza with sausage, pepperoni, artichokes, and mushrooms with the red sauce and fresh mozz.  There are so many flavor combinations I look forward to going back to try more.  They have a good selection of beer and wine, a soda machine, and I think I saw 4 different kinds of tea.  Hey....it's getting close to lunch time.  I better go get a pizza!

As a rule I try to avoid any place at peak hours because I deal with enough crowds and annoying people while I'm traveling.  BUT sometimes I forget myself because I get hungry and then it's all over.  I'm goin'.    Over the weekend Mr. M and I went back to Fired Pie and decided we were just going to share their specialty pie called Hawaiian BBQ.   I should have called ahead and placed the order to go, but then I might have missed the floor show.  As we arrive, some dude is out front attempting to back his Escalade into the first parking spot.  I think it took him 6 tries.  He should have his man card revoked.    We get in line behind what looks like a knock-off of the Kardashian women and they are all customizing their pizzas and each half is different.  One of them keeps walking in front of me to go over and get 4-inches from the menu board so she can re-read the choices.  She did this no less than 5 times.    They really need a dude at the entrance selling drinks for cash because by this point, I wanted one, just to help the time pass.    Five minutes into this here comes the dad and brother who happened to be the same dudes trying to park the Escalade out front.  Of course they get in line with their women, in front of us, and proceed to tack on their customized pies.  All told we waited approximately 25 minutes for that group of 5 just to order their pies.    Snoozefest.  I almost forgot why I was there.  I got light-headed and thought I was in the airport for a minute.    But then we finally got our Hawaiian pie and a lovely chilled glass of pinot grigio.  Happy belly and a cheap, good lunch when we didn't feel like cooking.  I'll definitely be back, but at like 2:30 in the afternoon or something!  ;-)

Well I have heard how busy this place gets, so when Mr. M got home early from work on Friday, I told him to put on some old clothes and we were going to hit this place early to beat the rush.  We skipped lunch and got there a little before 4:00 so we were starving.  Autumn was our server to start with and she was great.  She took the time to ask us if we'd been there before and then gave us a rundown of the menu.  She also recommended the gumbo, which I don't normally try, only because I'd had bad experiences at other places in the past, and I'm so glad we listened to her.  The gumbo is rich and full of flavor.  Tons of tender little shrimp and pieces of sausage, and great seasoning.  Very nice.  I'm still thinking about it and want some more.  We also got an order of hush puppies which were really good, and had a nice little kick.  We ordered a pound of mussels, add sausage, trifecta mild style, and also a pound of shrimp the same way.  What can I say?  The 4 and 5-star reviews are spot on.  Everything was delicious and the service is great.  If there are restaurants out there that get complaints about their service, come spend some time here to see how it's done.  Every employee I saw was smiling, friendly, and helpful.  Some places just get that figured out.  They hire and keep good people.  At some point Autumn's shift was ending, and Kaitlin took over.  She was great as well.    We got great happy hour prices on our beers also.  With 2 Abita Ambers and 2 Sierra Nevada Kellerweis, and all that food it was $46.75, before tax & tip.    I only have 2 items that keep it from being 5-star.  First, there were about 7 mussels that did not open.  Can't eat 'em.  We were still full, but I wonder if that was a quarter of the pound that we were not able to eat.  And also, their credit card machines were down, so they had to do the old school card imprint forms which print the entire card number and expiration date on the carbons.  I wish we would have been given the option to use a credit card instead of the debit card that I handed over when we got the bill.  If those carbons fall into the wrong hands, then I have more protection with the credit card.  Next time, let people know before you grab the card.  It can make a huge difference if something goes wrong.    And just a side note, to the people who complain they run out of stuff, A. it's a really busy place, that's going to happen, and B. I'd rather have them run out on occasion because then you know they keep things fresh.  The alternative is something I don't even want to think about.

Mr. M and I hit this place yesterday because we had a Groupon for a charcuterie board and 2 beer flights.  It's tucked back behind the Marriott (good to know) and was totally quiet when we walked in around noon.  People must have been out standing in the return/exchange lines or shopping.  Right away I liked the design of the place.  They have some excellent iron work with the sign over the passageway, and on the bar stools.  Love that.  The interior is very comfortable and stylish.  Nicely done.    We didn't get the bartender's name, but she was great.  She explained the available beers and we talked about the charcuterie boards and decided to order the Prohibition Stockpile board and the turkey and fig panini to share.  Everything was really nice and we ended up enjoying a leisurely lunch.  The quality of the meats on the board was outstanding and we got to try a few things we've never had before like caper berries and mostarda di fruta made with a pear.  Really excellent and paired nicely with the beers.    The panini was filled with good quality ingredients and I loved that the bread was fresh and light.  So many places use large, dense bread that kind of overwhelms the sandwich and is also way too filling.  Their panini was perfect.  I would definitely order food there again.  The beers were nice.  That's the best way I can describe them.  Very mild, complex flavors and nothing with a knock-you-on-your-butt ABV which I appreciate.  Thank you thank you thank you for brewing an IPA that doesn't have such a bitter & dry finish that I feel like my tongue has been stripped.  The IPA is excellent and so is the saison.  The lager may become our new hanging out by the pool beer.  We brought a 6-pack of that home.    They also have a very nice Abita Pecan brew on tap right now.  That one made me wish I had a growler with me.  Overall an excellent experience for us.  Some people may like their beers with a lot more aggressive flavors, and they may not like Bad Water as much as we did, but it's still a great experience and a priority for us to support our local brewers.  We'll definitely be back.

There is no better coffee in my opinion.  Really rich and nutty and they always have friendly staff.  A medium iced annihilator is my drink of choice, but I have no doubt they are all good.  I wish we had one closer to home.  Just not too close to the mall or Fulton Ranch please.  Somewhere around Alma School & Ray would be perfect!

I have to thank Scott P. for his great review of this place.  I was browsing Yelp one morning, checking my bookmarks, and reading reviews just to find someplace new that caught my eye, and Rania's certainly did that.  What a fantastic first impression!  We were greeted right away and guided to a booth, and our server, Margaret, took our drink order and said she'd give us time to look at the menu.  I had already been scoping it out on the internet and drooling over the choices, so we started with 2 of the Beef Mantu and 2 of the Ashak on the small plate menu.  I love that they have different amounts for these so you can get as many as you want.  With a salad and some bread you could make a meal out of the small plates alone.  I wish I could describe the flavors in a way that would really do both of these dishes justice, but they were amazing and a blend that I had never tasted before.  The mantu in particular had a little heat to the seasoning blend, but nothing overwhelming at all.  It was very pleasant and I want to go back and eat those again for sure.    Then for our entrees I ordered the chicken breast and beef sirloin kabob platter with brown rice and the naan bread.  Mr. M ordered the pan fried fish with spinach rice and the salad bar.    The salad bar choices are really varied and nice and fresh.  Mr. M came back with some greens, chickpeas, olives, and I think some raisins were in there, but it was a nice way to start the meal.  The bread is great too, and I agree with other reviewers who say it's a little different from what you might expect.  A few charred edges and a thinly fluffy interior make this bread different and very tasty.  I loved scooping some rice and grilled meat from my plate onto some bread and tasting that group of flavors.  Wow.  Just wow.  Mr. M's fish was fried perfectly as well.  Nice light breading and nice light texture all around.  Again, a blend of seasonings that I'm too inexperienced to describe, but it was delicious.  And he said he usually does not like rice, but he ate every bit of that spinach rice.  Our total for those 4 items plus an iced tea was $34.70 before tip.    They have a Yelp check-in offer too that is something like a free small plate with the purchase of an entrée, and there is also a groupon out there for them.  Now is the time to give Rania's a try if you've been thinking about it.  I look forward to a return visit.

We had another amazing meal at Rania's last night.  Mr. M ordered the Cornish hen platter with spinach rice and I had the Beef Keemah and Chicken Keemah combo platter with the Kabuli-style rice.  I wanted to try a different small plate from the last time and we got the chicken samosas.  The outer crust is golden brown and flaky and the interior is stuffed with very flavorful chicken.  I'm not sure about the seasonings, but I swear I tasted a little curry and some cumin.  The owner came by to check on us and I tried to quiz him but he was very coy and rightfully so.  I wouldn't want to give it away either.  Lovely way to start the meal.  Mr. M's Cornish hen platter was just ridiculous.  We both attacked that like a couple of starving cavemen, no talking, just eating.  Grilled and seasoned perfectly and nice and juicy.  You know it's good when you order it and the server moans just thinking about it.  Our server, Jordyn, was really friendly and took great care of us.  I feel like a broken record, but my keemah platter was also deliciously seasoned and we ended up with lots of great leftovers to have for lunch today.    We did discover they have a handful of good beers on tap.  I believe last night our choices were Four Peaks 8th Street Ale & Kiltlifter, Mudshark Morning Buzz,  and Shock Top.  I also heard them say they have wine.  Next time I'm going to do that.  A glass of wine would be fantastic with these dishes.    We had a groupon which was taken care of no problem.  Total before the $20 groupon with a small plate, 2 platters, and 2 beers was $46.78.  Money well spent.  Already planning our next visit.

What a great find!  Lately I've been watching the show, Treme, on Amazon Prime and it has totally drawn me in with the music and the food.  Oh yeah.  I wanted to find some good Cajun food.  I haven't had the luck to spend any time in New Orleans, unfortunately, but several years ago I did have one week in Baton Rouge and totally immersed myself in the food and the music.  Whatever the locals recommended, that's what I'd eat and it was all fantastic.  We decided to venture out yesterday and try Baby Kay's during Happy Hour.  I ordered a cup of chicken and sausage gumbo ($4.50 HH price) and the crab cake ($5).  Mr. M had the crawfish etouffee with dirty rice ($8 plus $1 for the dirty rice) and we had some delicious, cold Abita brews which are $3 during happy hour.    Everything was great!  What flavors!  My cup of gumbo was very filling.  The crab cake was fried perfectly and full of fresh crab.  Delicious!  As good as my items were, Mr. M's etouffee was the best of the bunch.  The flavors just blew me away and it was full of bites of crawfish.  The dirty rice was very tasty as well.  I want to go back and try that dish with the fried catfish with the etouffee poured over it.  Oh my...that has to be heavenly.  Before tax and tip our total was $27.50  Krista took great care of us and we definitely look forward to returning and trying more items on the menu.

I've been waiting to update my review until after I got myself back over here to try their Thursday night fried chicken.  I'm convinced there is nothing bad on this menu.  There isn't even anything just ok or mediocre.  It's all great.  My husband and I sat at the bar last night after a long day of work.  It seriously should have been Friday yesterday.  Sure felt like it.  The sign out front said, "a hurricane will take away your pain".  OK.  Two hurricanes.  And an order of LuLu wings please.    Ah.  The world goes away.  The man and woman taking turns working behind the bar are so friendly and funny that it's hard to stay in a bad mood.  And there was a father/son pair sitting at my left elbow and they were fun to talk to as well.  This was their first visit to Baby Kay's and they enjoyed what they ate, but they were eyeballing our wings, so I gave them one.  They said, "We know what to order next time!  Those wings are delicious!"  Yes they are.    We also ordered the fried chicken dinner which is perfect to share because it's a half chicken, 2 sides, and some garlic bread.  We got ours with the green olive cole slaw and dirty rice.  We also tried Abita's Andygator which is a helles doppelbock.  What?!?!  Somebody pinch me!  Am I drinking beer in Germany with Cajun music in the background?  Loved the dinner and the beer.  Great all around.    Since my last review, we were also in on a Saturday night for the smothered pork chop special.  That pork chop is nothing short of amazing.  It's so tender it just falls apart, and is covered with a rich brown gravy.  Mmmm...mmmm...that's some good eatin', Clark.  I want to go back and get that for sure.  So, yeah.  Still great food and great service.  Baby Kay's has become one of our favorite places.

If I'm flying out of terminal 4 then I'm eating at Matt's Big Breakfast.  Even if my flight is at 10:00 or noon or 2:00.  Even if I have to traipse the rest of the way around the terminal to my Southwest gate, it's worth it to me to get here early and have a delicious breakfast.  They have the best bacon for sure, and the staff has always been fast and friendly.  Maybe someday I'll try something else, but for me the hog and chick is the way to go.  Love everything about this breakfast from the bacon to the roasted potatoes to the homemade raspberry preserves on the fresh baked marble rye toast.    Delicious!

How much fun is this place?  My husband's company management has been talking about doing a corporate function here so we thought we'd stop in and get the membership cards out of the way.  I love that there was a woman up front to greet us and guide us where we need to go.  Byron took excellent care of us at the membership counter and he's a fellow Iowan and Hawkeye fan so he's got my vote for Employee of the Month.    Then we walked around and checked out everything.  We really liked how roomy each section is with plenty of seating and a couple of TVs.  The range looks like a lot of fun with a variety of targets, and I also noticed how clean everything was.    We cruised through the bar and noticed there are some large booths with their own TV so you can sit with your group and watch your game of choice.  They also have a gaming area for those not swinging a club.  There were a lot of staff around and they were smiling and making sure people had what they needed, or answering any questions.    While on the way to the restrooms I noticed they have some meeting rooms and one group had booked one for their fantasy league draft.  We got a look at their catered food of wings and some other munchies and it all looked and smelled delicious.  I didn't snag any as I walked by, I swear!    Even though my golf clubs are only in the house as potential weapons now and I call myself a reformed golfer, I would definitely look forward to a corporate event or night out with out-of-town guests at Topgolf.  GREAT place!

I was happy to see a Panera open in my neighborhood because I've been carrying around a My Panera card that I can only use when I go back to St. Louis.  When I did live there Panera was my goto in the winter mainly for some quick, inexpensive comfort food, like a grilled cheese and a nice bowl of soup.    Due to the hot temps here in AZ, I've looked for lighter options.  I've used the drive-thru only at this Panera 4 times and overall have had good experiences.  I've gotten bagels and iced green tea twice and also tried their Mediterranean veggie sandwich and the Roasted Turkey and Avocado BLT.  All have been very fresh and tasty and only one time they forgot the napkins, but I was headed home so it was no big deal.    I feel for them and all the negative reviews.  This is a tough to please neighborhood with an inordinate number of people speeding around in their luxury SUVs acting like they are the only ones on the road, and the only ones in the restaurant.  If you don't cater to them you are in big trouble.  Hopefully this location can get their issues straightened out.  I know from the St. Louis perspective, Panera is a great corporate citizen which does a lot in the community and gives back to many charities that fight hunger.  I don't know if they are doing that here in AZ, but the next time I'm in I'm going to ask.

Well geez, on some weekends I might call our backyard and beer fridge, and the shuffling distance in between, a "beer research institute", but it's good to know there's also a cool brewery to visit as well.  The name alone got us in, but the knowledgeable staff, tasty food, and delicious beers have kept us coming back.  We've been a few times, tried a few different food items, and sampled all the beers.  They really do an excellent job all around.  The only thing I would change is to have the server stop back and check on us about 5 minutes after they drop the food.  We usually don't see them again until it's check time, or unless they notice an empty glass.    Their beers tend to be fairly aggressive on the flavor and the ABV, so we have to be careful and flip a coin for who is going to drive and who is going to have another drink.  The last time we were there the Belgian lollis were both superb and the black IPA they had made me moan.  It was just that good.    All of the food items we've had were great, and next time we plan to finally try a burger, but you've got to get the pretzel nuggets to start.  Those really go nicely with the beers.  Overall, this has become one of our favorite local breweries.

Some places deserve more than 5 stars and this is one of them.  A few months ago I stopped in and tried the Hard Hat breakfast sandwich ($8.00).  With eggs, roast beef, sharp cheddar, onion, & a jalapeno spread, this is a perfect sandwich.  Great flavor combinations!  I have since been back and brought my husband along to have this sandwich a few more times.  For me, it was difficult to order anything else because I enjoyed this one so much.  With a bounty juice drink, I felt like I had a great breakfast.    I still wanted to return either for lunch or dinner sometime and try a couple of the grilled cheeses, which sounded amazing as well.  Earlier this week we finally made it and tried the Appiccicoso (Gooey) and the Rusty Pig, both $8.50.  The Gooey has mozzarella, pesto, pepperoni, salami, capicola, & roasted tomatoes on ciabatta, and the Rusty Pig has mozzarella, balsamic vinaigrette, roasted tomatoes, fresh basil, and applewood smoked bacon on sourdough bread.    For both the flavors were so fresh and delicious.  I can tell quality is the priority here, and I also liked the fact that the bread is thin and doesn't overwhelm the sandwich.  The ingredients really shine.  We also tried a cookie that was fantastic and now every time I go in I look for another one.    The service is friendly and fast, and they have several options to pick up your order.  You can come in of course, or call and pick it up, and they will even take it to you in your car out front.  Just call ahead.  We also visited with the owner about potential catering orders.  They do it all.    Fantastic place!  Best grilled cheeses I have ever had!

I use the words "tasty", "delicious", and "fantastic" frequently when I'm writing reviews.  It's time for a new word.  Sublime.  That's how I would describe the pastrami from this deli.  I didn't get a very good picture because I had picked up some food to go and then met my husband for lunch at his office and we were sitting outside, but next time, I'll get a food porn shot to end all food porn shots of that pastrami.  Get it.  That's all you need to know.  Full of flavor and will almost melt in your mouth.  We also tried the half sandwich on homemade bread with salami, prosciutto, and asiago.  Hooked up with the works, that one was...let me find another new word...that sub was classic.  The homemade bread is soft and chewy and the deli meats are tender and full of flavor.  Asiago adds a nice spark of flavor and the lettuce and other toppings round it out to make a perfect sandwich.  I am thrilled I don't have to drive all the way to Defalco's to get a sandwich like this.  I did not see Emilie, but Carlo is completely charming and was singing while he was preparing the food.    Don't even get me started on the dessert counter.  I can't look at it.  It's too beautiful.  If you don't want to have to buy larger pants, don't look at it either.  One glance and it was a blur of chocolate and cannoli and carrot cake.  I can't take it.    The high reviews are well-deserved.  It took me awhile to visit for the first time, but it won't take long for me to make a return visit.

Really delicious donuts!  I woke up early and thought I'd beat the heat and the rush and snag some donuts.  When I arrived a little after 6 it was kind of an odd scene.  Two couples were sitting at their tables without any donuts.  I was able to walk right up and see what was on display.  The cases were only about a third full, but what was there looked really good.    A nice young woman yelled from the back that she'd be right with me.  Well I was guessing that we were waiting on fresh donuts and/or something one of the couples had ordered so I just continued to stare at the donuts and try to figure out which ones I wanted.    The woman working in the back brought up a box of goodies for one of the couples, they paid and left.  Then I got to wait 15 minutes while the other couple, who had been sitting there before I arrived, figured out their dozen to go, plus a few to eat there.  The case was still mostly empty but I could tell they were working on fresh donuts in the back.    Finally it all made sense.  They open at 6:00 on Sundays, not 5 like the online listing says.  I made my choices and headed out.  The woman working was really nice.  I got a half doz plus one for free, a doz donut holes, and a shiny new punch card.  The punch card is if you buy 7 doz you get one free.  As others have said, these donuts are light and fresh.  Really nice.  I had those donut holes gone before I even made it to Dutch Bros.  I haven't had donuts in awhile so I'm sure I'll be a little piggy with them this morning.  Really glad I got up early and made the drive!

While everyone else was shopping on Friday morning, Mr. M and I got up early and cleaned the entire house, did some yard work, dug out the Christmas lights, untangled the Christmas lights, argued over where to put said lights, and finally called it a morning.  By the time Zzeeks opened, we were waiting outside like a couple of junkies, starving and thinking about wings and pizza and beer.  We had earned it.  This was our first time here, and I had purchased a $25 Groupon as well.  There was one other chick in the place, and she got her food to go and then we had the place all to ourselves.  We started with 10 of the bone-in wings ($7.99), honey citrus pepper flavor, and ordered a couple of beers.  We were feeling the holiday spirit and tried the Leinenkugel Snowdrift vanilla porter ($2.50).  It's a good beer (Breckenridge's vanilla porter is better), but wasn't the best choice with our food.  Should have gotten a lager or something.  I didn't look too closely, but it looked like they had 6 or 7 beers on tap, mostly from Four Peaks and San Tan.    The wings were delicious!  The sauce was a little sweet and a little spicy.  Really enjoyed those and will order them again for sure.  Then I ordered the 12" Philly cheesesteak pizza ($15.99) and Mr. M ordered a calzone with sausage ($7.99).  I have to thank the other yelpers who took pics of the Philly pizza.  That is a great pie!  Great cheesesteak flavor and nice crust.  Not thin and not too thick.  A perfect pizza for sure.    We also enjoyed the calzone.  My husband loves a good calzone and many times they are huge, thick monsters full of cheese.  All good, but this thinner one at Zzeeks was great too.  The sausage was nicely blended with the cheese and I like whatever seasoning and cheese they sprinkle on the top.  Perfect again.  The total with tax before the Groupon was $39.96.  Even if we would not have had the Groupon, I would have been happy with the food and the price.  Great food and service all around!  We will definitely be back.

I can't even remember how long I've had this place bookmarked.  Way too long.  I kept reading the reviews and seeing the pictures from my fellow Yelpers and knew I had to go.  I went over today to grab some early lunch to go and was not disappointed.  The machaca is fantastic.  So tender and full of lightly spiced flavors.  Based on other trusted reviews, I got it in a burrito enchilada-style, Christmas sauce and really enjoyed that.  I would get that again anytime.    Then I got just a ground beef hard shell taco because I love the crunchy tacos and this one was simple and perfect.  The shell held up well, and was stuffed full of nicely seasoned meat and cheese, lettuce, & tomatoes.  For those 2 items it was $10.36 after tax.  (It's a buck fifty to make it Christmas)  Someone was a little slow greeting me and taking my order at the counter, but it wasn't like they were goofing off back there.  I could tell they were busy making delicious food.  It would have been nice if the dude industriously filling the napkins would have said something, but hey, they have those napkins full before the lunch rush.  The gentleman who did take my order was friendly and funny.  I had a great lunch and will definitely be back.

Mr. M and I were just talking about how we will go out to eat less and save money and start riding bikes and maybe go to Orangetheory, and it all fell apart yesterday.  I don't know how, but we ended up at Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers right when they opened and were drawn in like a tractor beam to the bar.   An hour, 4 beers, an order of totchos, a Hangover burger, and a San Diego dog later, we felt like Juno when she said she was having a burrito baby, only we felt like we were having twins.    Have mercy, Uncle Jesse, but we waddled out to the car, drove home and flopped down by the pool like a couple of pregnant largemouth bass.  I don't remember much after that, but if I do have a baby, I'm going to name him Totcho.  OK.  Maybe the middle name.    Chris took great care of us at the bar, the beer selection is fantastic, and the food is such that you know you are throwing caution to the wind, either that or saying nanner nanner to all those vegans out there.  Big fat burgers cooked to order a perfect medium rare, a delicious bacon-wrapped dog, and those totchos...the totchos can't be missed.  Excellent all around.

Since about mid-October I've been totally abusing my body with sugar and grease.  This has got to stop.  I feel like a slug.    I had those exact thoughts as I was sitting in my car yesterday after picking up some food through the Popeyes drive-thru, artfully arranging the items for photos.  Well, eating healthier starts today.  Or, maybe after the New Year's holiday.    I had never had Popeyes up until a few months ago and now I have the dilemma of really liking it.  Their food flat out puts the colonel to shame.  No need to ever eat at KFC again.  And I would say it's better than Church's, although I do love Church's biscuits.    Popeyes chicken can be ordered either mild or spicy and the 4 times I've had it, it has been delicious and not greasy at all.  I really dig the red beans & rice and the mac and cheese.  The only complaint I have is that 3 out of the 4 times I've been I've gotten white meat when I ordered dark.  Finally yesterday I got 2 pieces of dark meat.  Thank you.  It was excellent.    I did manage to bring half of it home for my husband to try because he had never eaten at Popeyes either.  Now I have a partner in crime when we want to go out for fast food fried chicken.  Usually I have a bit of a drive to get to one, so that has slowed me down from eating there more often, but they are building a new one on Alma School, just north of Queen Creek Road.  That is very close.    I don't want to be one of those clowns always talking about New Year's resolutions, so eating healthier can start in February.  I do have a vacation coming up.

As Adam Richman has said, "OH my goodness.  Oh.  My.  Goodness!"    I've had FrinGo's bookmarked for awhile and finally made my way over there this week.  I was  craving comfort food and this certainly fit the bill.  On my first visit I had the chicken and potatoes with yellow rice and beans.  Pollo Guisado, arroz con gandules y habichuelas guisada. ($8.00)  And of course I got an order of maduros ($2.50), which are fried sweet plantains.  I haven't eaten like this since I lived in Florida and it took me right back.  The chicken and potatoes have been braised to perfection and the flavorful yellow rice and beans are the perfect accompaniments.  The maduros were fried perfectly, soft and sweet with a caramelized edge.  I'll probably get those every single time I eat here.  What a treat!  Today I tried the pernil (slow roasted pork $8.50) with the same two sides.  White rice is also an option.  And the maduros.  AND a relleno de papa ($2.50) which is a ground beef stuffed potato ball.  That relleno was perfect.  Fried golden brown on the outside and then full of potatoes and seasoned ground beef.  Everything was delicious once again.  The pernil was tender and they gave me a huge portion.  Besides being a great tasting meal, the prices are reasonable and I've been able to get 2 meals out of each one.    The staff has been very friendly and helpful on both visits and there are about 8 tables if you dine in.  My preference is to bring it home, have a beer with my meal, rub my full belly for good luck, and then take a huge nap.  Oh my goodness.

8-10 years ago I was working in Chicago quite a bit, driving up from St. Louis for a week at a time and that's when I discovered Portillo's and that beef and cheddar croissant.  That thing is magical.  Totally unhealthy and I love it.  I think back then I tried a couple of other things on the menu, but when I think of Portillo's I think of that sandwich.  Now that Portillo's is in AZ we thought we'd give them a try and see if it's still how I remember.  And get this.....Mr. M lived in Chicago for a few years and had NEVER been to a Portillo's.  Can you believe that?  So we had to go.  He ordered the Italian sausage with bacon and I ordered the polish sausage.  We also ordered the Chicken Pecan salad thinking sharing a salad would soothe our guilty consciences for eating those tasty sausages.    My polish was about a 3/5.  The sausage itself was great, 5/5, but the bun was soggy and fell apart after one bite and had way too many thick onions on top.  I love onions, but this was overkill.  I had to pick half of them off and it was still smothered with onions.    Mr. M's Italian sausage with bacon was probably our favorite thing that we tried.  4/5.  The sausage had a very nice flavor and came on a more sturdy, Italian bread type bun.  Next time I'll have to get the polish on that bun.  It held up very well.  As you can see in the pic, the bacon isn't high quality bacon, kinda tasted like the precooked stuff, but it worked.    The salad was kind of a letdown.  2.5 or 3/5.  I thought it was kind of funny how 6 pieces of spinach ringed the bowl, but then 98% of the salad was just bland iceberg lettuce.  The description on the menu says a blend of lettuces.  It was mainly iceberg.  The chicken was ok, but tasted a little like the precooked stuff too.  It also had a gazillion diced, tasteless tomatoes in it.  With tax those salads are close to 8 bucks apiece and I'm not sure they are worth it.  Didn't hate it, but probably wouldn't get it again.    I like that their bottles of water are only 99 cents.  A lot of places try to bend you over there and charge 2 bucks or more for a cheap bottle of water.  Overall an okay meal with the sausages being the star of the show.  I can't believe I didn't get the beef and cheddar croissant, but that's just a reason to go back.  They have enough good stuff on the menu to justify the 4 stars for me, and generally the staff are very friendly and helpful.  They are used to being busy and have a good system down.  The only complaint I had was there was an employee cleaning tables who had a spray bottle of chemical that he spritzed a little too close to our food.  Be aware dude.  I don't want my food glazed with Windex or whatever the heck.

Hey I really dig these make-it-to-order pizza joints.  I stopped in today and ordered the classic margherita plus artichokes.  The employees greet people right away, and I like the clean, sunny room.    Initially they seemed to be a little disorganized on keeping track of whose pizza was where in the oven, but that should work itself out in time.  They tried to give me Ed's pizza, and Ed's pizza looked pretty good, full of meat, mushrooms, and olives, but I'm not Ed.    I took my pie home to scarf in private and really enjoyed the flavors.  The garlicky olive oil is very nice and fresh tomatoes and basil make for a perfect mix of flavors.  I just think the grape tomatoes might not be the best idea.  They fall off easily.  Some sliced romas might work out better.  The crust was crisp and buttery, just like I like it.  Overall this is a great addition to all the restaurants by the mall.  And the price...can't beat the price...$7.95 plus tax equals a pizza for $8.57, and I only ate half of it, I swear!

I've been here twice and I can't think of anything negative.  The first time was with 3 coworkers and one of the guys and I shared our lunch so we could try a couple of things.  We went halvsies on the BMLT and the green chile burger.  Both were very nicely done.  They actually cooked the burger medium rare and it was a great burger with lots of flavor with fresh ingredients.  As good as the burger was, the BMLT outshone it for sure.  I love the twist on a BLT by using fresh mozzarella and pesto.  That sandwich was fantastic, and I'm really surprised I didn't get it again the 2nd time I was there.  One of my coworkers had wings and the other had a chicken sandwich.  Both of them really enjoyed their food as well.  The house made chips were a nice touch too.  On that visit Kayla took great care of us and was friendly and efficient with refills, and had no problem handling separate checks.  Their beer selection looked interesting when I was there the first time, but since it's frowned upon to drink during working hours, I returned the following Saturday with my husband so we could have some beer and enjoy the patio.    On that visit we tried a beer sampler and ate the Cubano and chicken pot pie.  I have to admit I think I gave him one teeny bite of my pot pie, but kept the rest all to myself.  They've got a great recipe and it was perfect comfort food for what turned out to be kind of a chilly afternoon outside.  He really enjoyed the Cubano, and the beers were good as well.  The standouts for us were the Dubbel and the Marzen, but we didn't taste a bad one in the bunch.  As an app we tried the pretzel and that was perfect and lasted about 10 seconds!  On that visit Alena was our server and she did a great job even though they were fairly busy.  Whoever designed the place did an excellent job.  Like I said, I have no complaints and look forward to a return visit.

I stopped in a few weeks ago and ordered a half loaded potato skin and a half meaty Italiano minus olives pizza ($7.99), and had a San Tan Oktoberfest ($4.39) to wash it all down.  Right away I was greeted by the employees and I really like the interior.  They did a nice job.  It's funky and interesting.  They have a fantastic selection of local brews and wine to choose from as well, and the pizza combinations on the wall of fame are very creative.  I saw several I want to try.  Of course you can also build your own.  The potato skin pizza had intrigued me when I looked at their menu online, and living up to its name, it does taste like potato skins which goes GREAT with the beer.  The meaty Italiano half was very good as well, with lots of good quality meats.  I just didn't care for the crust.  It's a nice thickness, but totally bland.  I read the other reviews and the owner's comment about why they use the conveyor ovens.  That makes sense.  I just miss some kind of garlicky or buttery or seasoned flavor in the crust if it's not going to have that brick oven flavor and char.  Thankfully the toppings are all excellent and kind of overcompensate for the crust.  I enjoyed my first visit and my husband really enjoyed the leftovers.  I will definitely be back.

4.5/5  This joint is all about the meat.  It sure as heck isn't about the sides of white rice and macaroni salad.  Those must be traditional sides because I see other Hawaiian-themed joints have those, but they do nothing for me.  I wish they had some greens or something a little healthier.  But anyway, back to the meat.  On my first visit I ordered the BBQ mix to try a variety of meats, some crab puffs, and potstickers ($5.98).  My husband was working in Chicago, so left to my own devices I scarfed that down by myself and took a huge nap.  That was a great afternoon.    For my second visit, he was here so I had to share (boo), and yesterday we picked up another BBQ mix combo ($10.98), the katsu chicken and kahlua pork combo ($8.58), and some crab puffs.  I am a total junkie for crab puffs and theirs ($4.38) aren't the best I've had (Dragon Wok and Tott's) but they are pretty good.    The meats are all so flavorful and tender.  I don't really have a favorite because they are all so good.  I loved the lightly breaded katsu chicken which comes with a nice dipping sauce.  The BBQ mix combo is a good choice if you want to sample their beef, chicken, and ribs.  They all are so tender and each has its own distinctive flavor.    The restaurant is very simply decorated and clean with friendly employees.  I'm already thinking about going back and getting some more of that chicken and trying something else.  This was my first time trying any kind of Hawaiian food and I'm so glad it's delicious and close to home.

Mr. M and I were driving around aimlessly last Sunday and with the cloudy weather I was craving soup.  We knew there was a Blue 32 somewhere in this area and I then started thinking about their baked potato soup.  Oh yeah!   That's what I want.  This is a nice newer location tucked back off Higley in a strip mall, and right away we were greeted by the hostess and seated in a booth along the side wall.  TVs everywhere!  It was easy to keep up with whatever sports action was going on at the time.  On that note, can we just get to baseball season...please!  We started with the calamari app and I had a pint of Papago Orange Blossom Ale and he had a pint of Sam Adams winter lager.  Both are beers we are well familiar with and they went well with the calamari.  The calamari were fried nice and light with a good dipping sauce on the side, but the breading had way too much black pepper for our taste.  Smart on their part because that will make people drink more beer.  We ate it, but I would not order it again.  Then came my bowl of baked potato soup which was just as good as I remember from having it at the other Gilbert location.  I aspire to make soup this good.    Mr. M tried the pastrami sliders and those were really delicious!  Flavorful, tender pastrami, melty cheese, fresh pickles, toasted buns, AND you get 4 instead of 3 like most places.  Now we have a couple of new addictions at Blue 32.  The soup, those sliders, and orange blossom ale.  Could it get any better?  Yum!    With the food I mentioned plus another pint of orange blossom ale to share, the total was $37.77 before tax and tip.  Lexi was our server and she took great care of us.  Can we have a Blue 32 over here in south Chandler please???

So I've been circling this place like Charlie Sheen waiting for the red light to go on, and now they are open!    We just hit the drive-thru and picked up some popcorn shrimp, tenders, & red beans & rice to bring home.  The popcorn shrimp were light, and pair very well with their creole cocktail sauce.  The sauce has a little kick and we immediately popped open a beer to enjoy with them.  I sense there will be a lot of those shrimp in our future.    Our buddy Tim S. is right.  Those tenders are excellent!  Moist and fresh.  And of course the red beans & rice is great.  The only negative I can see about this place is waiting behind some Range Rover-driving Fulton Ranch twit ordering $67 dollars in the drive-thru.  Already happened.  Go get some chicken!

Now I'm not going to tell you exactly how many times I've been to this Popeyes since they opened.  It's embarrassing.  I really should jog or ride my bike to this place instead of sit in my nice air-conditioned car in the drive thru.  It's so easy though.  And when it's good, it's really good.  Crack chicken, even more so than the crack chicken at Chick-fil-a.  But I had to come back and do an update and take a star away.    If you do a search for Popeyes for the metro area they all slip into mediocrity.  Why?  Inattention is my theory.  One evening my dear husband picked up a family meal through the drive thru with 2 large sides.  Got home & only had 1 side.  Had to go back and get the crack red beans & rice of course.  No sorry or anything.  Just a "here ya go".    One afternoon I went through the drive thru and picked up a 3 pc. chicken tender meal.  One tender was fantastic.  The crackiest of the crackin'.  The other 2 were old, like from yesterday's lunch old and really nasty.  @#$% dammit!  Today I got some delicious chicken, mac & cheese, and potatoes and gravy.  No spork or napkin.    C'mon now.  Get it together.  Serve it fresh with all the usual accoutrements.  (God that's a great word and does NOT go at all with a review for fast food chicken).  It's not that difficult.  Don't make me put you on double secret probation like I have that other crack chicken joint.  The staff is always friendly, but the person on the drive thru is usually talking 900 mph and most of the time asks me a question I already answered.  Now, I can't re-enact it in this review, so as always, you'll just have to take my word for it.

Yesterday I had met a friend for lunch at Ike's, which we all know is amazing, and as I was blasting by on Alma School I noticed this newly-opened Dickey's.  When I used to travel all over the country Dickey's was one of my goto places if I was craving BBQ and there was one close to the hotel.  They are consistent, the staff is friendly, and for me, it's a relaxing atmosphere.  I don't listen to country music generally, but for some reason I really feel at home at Dickey's.  And if you don't tap your toes to John Denver singing "Thank God I'm a Country Boy", well then there's something wrong with you.  This morning I told my Mr. that I had an idea for lunch.  Let's go to Dickey's and share something and then go to Ike's and share something.  Well, I got myself under control and we just ate at Dickey's.  It smelled so good in the parking lot, that I knew it would be tough to decide what to order.  When we walked in we were greeted by friendly employees, one of whom explained the layout of the restaurant & the ordering process.  Then we ordered a 1/4 lb of chopped brisket ($4), a 1/4 lb. smoked sausage ($3.75), a side of green beans ($2.25) and a side of baked potato casserole ($2.25).  They also brought us some freshly baked rolls.  Everything was delicious except I thought the brisket was a little over-seasoned.  It kind of irritated my throat it was so salty, but that's why you buy the big yellow cup ($2.25), to fill it with something to wash it all down.  As a side note they have Coke products.    I love their sides.  The green beans taste like something my grandma used to make with bacon and some pepper.  Delicious!  And I could eat a large side of that potato casserole all by myself.  REAL potatoes with a little salt and pepper.  Just perfect.  All in we spent $15.67 after tax and it was plenty of food for both of us.  They also have a punch card so I can earn some free food.  I'm sure we'll be back now that there's one closer to home.

What a fun store!  They have a wide variety of southwestern themed items for inside and outside the home.  I go about once a month to just browse because they frequently get new items.  The prices are reasonable and the owners and employees have always been very friendly and helpful.    My husband likes the furniture in their space next door too.  They have household furniture that has a serious southwestern theme, and then they have fun stuff like a wooden bar or beer chest with the Corona logo on it.  Looks like something you'd find at a beachy bar in Mexico.  Wish we had lots of money to just go crazy in this place.
