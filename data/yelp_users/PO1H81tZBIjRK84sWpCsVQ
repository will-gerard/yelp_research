I don't know how I've never reviewed Postino before! It's definitely my go to for date night or girls night. They have great specials including the infamous $20 bottle & board deal on Mondays and Tuesdays after 8pm. If you can make it for lunch or early happy hour they also offer $5 glasses of wine until 5pm.   My favorite bruschetta toppings are the Brie, apple + fig, and the goat cheese + roasted red pepper. The smoked salmon pesto is worth noting as well. When I'm in the mood for something lighter I usually go for the mixed greens salad with pear, candied nuts, Gorgonzola and a light vinaigrette.   The only reason I docked a star is because I'm not a fan of the parking situation. It's extremely limited. And while they have valet, I wish there was a way to offer more (free) parking.

I was in the market for a sectional and was recommended to check out Pruitts. Very glad I did. On my first visit I was greeted immediately by a friendly gentleman who showed me upstairs to the sectionals, gave me some brief history about the business, and pointed me in the direction of what I was looking for specifically. He was very helpful and not in an overly pushy way like some sales people.  The prices here can't be beat. I found exactly what I wanted and stayed within my budget. Other furniture stores had the couch I picked priced $100 - $200 more than what I paid at Pruitts.   They offer a flat rate delivery fee of around $70 or you can pick up your purchase from their warehouse off of 43rd Ave & Washington. I opted to pick up the couch myself, and the warehouse guys were very helpful loading it in to my friend's truck.   My only complaint is when we got the pieces unwrapped I discovered I was missing one set of the feet to my couch. I called the store and they told me the warehouse only had brown feet available and I needed black, and I would have to drive back to the warehouse to pick them up. Kind of annoying, but my couch looks fine footless ;)

I have been seeing Julie Bergdale, RNP, for about four years now and I can honestly say she is my favorite doctor I have ever had the pleasure of working with. She has great bed (table?) side manner and always makes me feel comfortable. Going to the gyno can be as unpleasant as visiting the dentist or making a speech in public, but Julie always puts me at ease.   I have recommended her to two of my friends, who also enjoy seeing her. Two thumbs up to Julie and the staff at Camelback Women's Health!

I will go out of my way to go to this Hi Health location because the employees are so knowledgeable and friendly. Some people who work in retail/sales act inconvenienced when asked questions or for help, but not at this store.   I have been having knee issues for a while and the sales girl was very helpful in finding me the right product for my problems, while being conscious of my wallet.  On another instance I was in the market for some diet pills and the sales girl recommended I also take vitamin C supplements so the diet pills would remain effective until the end of the bottle. I appreciated her suggestion and found the pills to be very effective.   Thumbs up, Hi Health!

I had the pleasure of dining at Zinc recently on a first date. At first I was a little apprehensive, expecting a hoity toity atmosphere and snobby employees, but I am pleased to agree with other reviewers that that was simply not the case.   It was pretty quiet when we arrived around 8pm on a Tuesday, but we were warmly greeted by the hostesses and given a nice little "date table" on their patio.   I started with a delicious glass of Sauvignon Blanc; my date had a Pinot Noir. Our server recommended the ahi tuna "steak tartare" appetizer which was absolutely yummy. I was a little sketched out to see it served with rye bread, but somehow all the flavors meshed very well together.   After debating between the salmon and the scallops, I went with the latter. I am a huge sucker for scallops *wink wink nudge nudge to any prospective dates ;)* To be honest I'm not even sure what all the pretty sauces and garnishes on my plate were, but I liked it! I know the black sauce was squid ink, after being cautioned by our server that it has a distinct taste that you either like or you don't. I didn't find it to be offensive, and actually dipped one of my lightly breaded shrimp in it. The scallops themselves were very good. I cleaned my plate! (Is that bad first date manners? I couldn't help it!)  My date had the flat iron steak which came served with truffle fries. He's a Zinc "regular" and claims the steak is his favorite thing off the menu. I didn't try it, not a huge red meat eater. But I did steal a few fries which were tasty with their house made ketchup.   It was a very pleasant dining experience, unfortunately I didn't save room for dessert. Our server was there when we needed her and absent when we didn't. The busboy was prompt with water refills and removing dirty plates. Although Zinc has a heftier price tag than I'd probably pay for myself, I'd go again if asked on a second date!

I will go out of my way to go to this DD location! My only gripe is the lack of a drive-thru, but I rarely wait more than a minute or two in line inside the store. The employees are very friendly, a few of whom recognize and know me by name.   They don't run out of caramel flavoring twice in one week, or "accidentally" serve me iced tea instead of iced coffee, unlike another location. *cough cough* Scottsdale & McKellips.  P.S.  99 cent iced coffees and iced teas from 3-6 pm :)

I love Trader Joe's! I shop there almost exclusively and will drive 15 minutes out of my way to get my fix.   I like that they offer healthy options at such reasonable prices, such as cage free eggs, Ezekial gluten free bread and fresh produce. Just better quality products all around, in my opinion.  They also sell a variety of delicious pre-made salads ranging from $3-5 that are surprisingly filling. My favorite is one with Israeli couscous and a spicy pimento dressing. Yum.  Staff is super friendly too. :)

My girl friend and I stopped in today for a smoothie before we went hiking. I had almost forgotten how much I don't really care for Jamba Juice.   While the lady working was very friendly and offered us coupons on our exit, my smoothie was really gritty - almost chewable - and in my opinion a little overpriced.   Also, most of their menu items aren't really THAT healthy. I wish they would explain the "boosts" that they offer.. like, tell me what exactly you are adding to my smoothie to "boost" it?  I prefer Juice It Up down in Tempe Marketplace for healthier options and a better bang for your buck.

Fiesta is definitely my favorite of the fast food Mexican places in town. I actually eat their food sober, although after a night in old town the burritos are even tastier, if that's possible.   I usually get a breakfast burrito with ham, eggs, cheese and pico. Their carne asada is pretty good too, but it tastes more like ground beef than steak to me. I like to add rice and get a side of sour cream, and for a mere $5 they are definitely filling.   My only gripe is that Fiesta isn't open 24/7 or offer the late night hours that some of the other -beto's do (they're open til 3am on Friday which is great, but 2am on Saturdays and 1am during the week). I work at a bar and sometimes don't get off work until 2:30 or 3am and am disappointed when Fiesta is closed "early".

I'm always a little skeptical taking my car to get work done, seeing as I am a girl who doesn't know squat about vehicles, but Ray did not make me feel uncomfortable at all. He was patient with me, informative and helpful.   I've taken my car in on two occasions now - the first was to correct some alignment issues (for the low price of $62.. so cheap!) and the second was to figure out why my check engine light was on. Turned out I just needed a new gas cap which was also a quick, inexpensive fix.   I would definitely feel comfortable taking my car to First Class Auto for any future problems, and recommend to others.

I always forget about Shady's because it's a little far from my house, but every time I go I'm reminded how much I like it!   Drink prices are amazing... You're definitely not in Scottsdale anymore! I got a martini on the rocks and a shot for $11. Can't beat it.   This isn't your typical Bud Light, vodka/soda type bar. I'm not a big beer drinker but I noticed they have a good selection of unique beers on tap. And the bartender made me my version of a French 75 (standard recipe + a float of Chamboard, it's delicious, try it) without any huff and puff.   Shady's also has a pool table, juke box with nice eclectic selection, and smoking patio. Wee!

I am very glad that my mom and I weren't deterred by Fuego's sort of hidden location and lack of visible crowd. We had a fantastic dinner this past weekend.   Service was great - enthusiastic and informative.   Mom started with a coconut mojito (one of Fuego's signature cocktails) and I had a glass of white sangria. I don't even like coconut and I thought her drink was delicious.  We shared an order of empanadas as an appetizer, per the recommendation of fellow Yelpers. I don't remember what they were stuffed with but they were good. I could have perhaps used a guac or some kind of dip, but then again I am a condiment freak.   I let our server pick my entree, between their nightly special (a blackened mahi mahi in tomatillo cream sauce) or the short rib. He chose the mahi for me and it was really, really good. All entrees come with your choice of 2 sides and I chose some sautéed green beans and jalapeño creamed corn. The creamed corn was tasty, but definitely had a kick to the aftertaste! Mom got the seafood stuffed chile relleno and let me tell you it was AWESOME. I was super jealous of her entree but she was nice and let me have a bite or three. I would definitely come back just to have that dish. Yum.  I will also be back to check out Fuego's happy hour, which runs Tuesday through Saturday from 3-6pm and includes a bunch of small plates and discounts on booze.

I've never had something from D'lish that I didn't like. The chicken panini and breakfast club are two of my favorites. Dirty chai vanilla latte rocks my socks. The only bad thing I could say about this place is sometimes the wait kind of sucks, but for the delicious food and drinks it's worth it!

I've been going to Darque Tan on and off for about three years now. This location keeps a nice, clean store and offers about 20 beds of varying intensity levels. I usually use a level 2 bed which carries a max of 20 minutes and gives me a nice color.  I went in today to buy a new package after taking a 6 month hiatus from tanning, and the sales associate was incredibly helpful. She took her time pulling about five bottles of lotion off the shelves and explaining all their different qualities and price points; she was very knowledgeable and I really appreciated her doing that. She didn't just pressure me in to buying the most expensive lotion they offer.   Darque Tan offers monthly memberships as well as pre-paid packages; I use the $33.88/month package that allows for unlimited tans in level 1 and 2 beds at any DT location.  The only reason I didn't give five stars is because their lotions are pretty pricey. I bought a "middle of the road" lotion with bronzers and DHA properties and it ran me $92, but they are offering a special right now that purchasing a lotion gives you money credited back to your account for upgrades.

I've been going to Tips and Toes every two weeks for the last few months for a standard gel manicure with French tips.   It's typically pretty quiet during the week. I stopped in today (Saturday) and got right in without having to wait, but I can definitely see them getting busy enough that an appointment may be more convenient.   The girls who do my manicure are always polite and friendly... Quiet if anything, but I don't mind using the hour to relax and zone out. I really appreciated the attention to detail my gal paid today; even though they had a full shop she didn't make me feel rushed at all, and took the time to go over her work.   My only gripe is that sometimes I am charged $25 and other times it's $30.. for no apparent reason? I'm not one to get upset over $5, I just find it odd.

I love Sprinkles cupcakes. I've never had a problem with dryness or lack of flavor. The red velvet is my absolute favorite, followed by lemon or peanut butter. Yummm!   The counter girls are always smiling and friendly.   Yes, the cupcakes are a little "spendy" at $3 - $4 per treat. But anyone who's had the pleasure of sampling Sprinkles' goodies before knows how rich they are, so in my opinion they're not meant to be a daily snack. Therefore I don't mind spending $3 or $4 on a rich, indulgent treat from time to time.

I'm not a huge fan of sub sandwiches or sandwich shops in general but EoS hit the spot for a quick bite before a night of debauchery. The Chipotle Chicken Avocado hot sandwich was just delicious. I seriously considered coming back for seconds when we rolled back in to Planet Hollywood at 5am!

What a miserable place. No one likes going to the DMV but they could at least try to make it as painless as possible? Instead they've implemented this ridiculous new "musical chairs" waiting system where first you stand in line, then move one chair over each time someone gets called to a window. And speaking of windows, expect only about 1/3 of them to be open.  The employees could also use a lesson in hospitality. No need to be so visibly miserable and frustrated with your job, and no need to snap at people or treat them like they're stupid when they have a question!

I had the pleasure of spending Valentines Day dinner at Eddie's House. I really don't understand some of these bad reviews.. Overall I had a nice experience.  We had an 8:45 reservation and were sat probably around 9. I didn't mind the wait because we got to belly up to the bar, have a glass of champagne and visit the nice bartender.   Once sat we were immediately served a bread basket accompanied by a pesto spread and bleu cheese butter. The pesto was very tasty.   My date and I split a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc and an order of the ahi tartar "nachos" appetizer. The tartar was very good and had a few surprising bites with a nice kick of spice.   For entrees I had scallops, (obviously) that came served with cauliflower. They were seared perfectly and I very much enjoyed them. My date had a prosciutto wrapped filet. I think. I was too wrapped up in my own dinner to pay much attention. Whoops ;)   Honestly the only part of the meal I didn't enjoy was the service. Our waiter was friendly enough but seemed extremely awkward. It was also pretty obvious he was trying to upsell us, which I understand is part of a servers job, but I don't like when it's so blatant.  Oh well. The awkwardness and pushy salesmanship will not be enough to deter me from returning. Apparently they do all night happy hour in the bar during the week. Sign me up!

They ALWAYS try to upsell me and tell me things are wrong with my car that need to be fixed immediately. I don't know if they think they can take advantage of me because I'm a girl and admittedly don't know much about cars, but it's really annoying.   Also, they don't really make it clear when your car is finished being serviced. I usually try to bring a book to make the time pass quicker.   I only come here when I have extra money to spend. And, when I feel like being a princess, as they gas up my car for me. $20 for an interior "detail" and exterior wash isn't horrendous, but I know of places that will do it for less.

Dukes is hands down my favorite dive bar in Scottsdale. I have had some major life events take place at Dukes, including a boyfriend dropping the "L bomb" for the first time. How romantic, right?!   Anyway, I always have a good time at Dukes. They have about a million TVs, pool tables, shuffleboard, darts, Buck Hunter etc... Definitely a little something for everyone! I find their drinks very reasonably priced - it seems like they always have specials on beers and shots.   The food is pretty decent for bar food. I'm a big fan of the buffalo style wings, they're nice and big and juicy. Nom nom nom!   Dukes also provides a free cab service if you happen to indulge in too many spirits. Don't drink and drive, y'all!  My only complaint is that once or twice I've caught some attitude from a bartender, but that's probably a fluke and service is usually fine for a dive bar.

I practically live within walking distance of La's, and enjoy getting takeout a handful of times per month.   My favorite dish is the peanut curry (panang) with chicken. I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy, but I always order at a medium spice level. I'll be drooling by the time I'm finished, but it's just so darn good!  I've also tried the red curry, green curry, spicy eggplant, tom kha gai, and pad Thai, and everything is great. The portions are definitely large enough to make two meals/servings.   No matter what time of day I call, my order is always ready in exactly 10 minutes. The girls who answer the phone and work the counter are very sweet and polite.

This is my new favorite place to get my gel manicure. After my old go-to nail place, who shall not be named, pissed me off for the last time, I reluctantly came to 7 Day with a friend who swore up and down by them. I was initially turned off by how busy the salon was, imagining long wait times for what was supposed to be a relaxing day with a friend. BUT, there was no wait! 7 Day handles their high volume periods extremely well.  I've never felt rushed, even during said busy afternoons. The girls who do my manicures are friendly and make conversation.  I had been getting gel manicures every 10 days at my old place, but 7 Day does a better job and must use a better quality product because I can now go over two weeks without needing them re-done.  The girls are also imaginative with designs. I'll bring in a picture of what I want and they put a fun twist on it.   I also appreciate that they give you complimentary bottled water. Nice touch!   I can't speak on the quality of their pedicures because I never had one, but my two friends who also frequent 7 Day say they're pretty great.   The girls prefer to be tipped in cash, by the way! But in the service industry, who doesn't? ;)

Mmmm, I love me some Daily Dose.   I've never received poor service here, always smiling, friendly girls. Plus I feel like there's always someone around to refill waters or remove a dirty plate.   When I dine at DD I'm typically in the mood for breakfast, so most of my recommendations come from that portion of the menu. Don't miss out on their bacon Bloody Mary, chorizo eggs Benedict, or peanut butter and jelly waffles.   Their burgers are really good too, and today I had the Old Town Stack (a prime rib sandwich with an onion slaw, horseradish mayo on a pretzel bun) that was pretty tasty.   A few parting comments: I hear they have happy hour from 4-9 Monday through Friday. That's insane (in a good way!) And, YES this place packs the house on the weekends, so be prepared to wait. But it's worth it.

This place has the friendliest staff of any coffee shop I've ever been to! Apparently the secret is out because they are always packed, sometimes the line snakes through the whole parking lot! But they are fast and efficient, with someone taking orders while you wait in line.  They make the consistently best chai latte in town. Lots of places make their lattes with way too much milk, but not Dutch Bros. 5 stars all the way around :)

I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Panchero's as I am from Iowa City, home of the original Panchero's location. It is a staple in downtown Iowa City nightlife; there's really nothing better than a ginormous messy burrito at 2am after a night of drinking.  I don't visit this store as often as I should. Their burritos are far superior to Chipotle in my opinion. The fresh pressed tortillas are super yummy. My go to burrito entails chicken, rice, queso (which carries an up charge but it is SO worth it!), cheese, sour cream, pico and mild sauce. Yes, this is my haven for feeding my inner fat kid ;)   I think Panchero's is very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. Today I got a burrito, small fountain drink, and a side of chips and guac for $12 and some change.  Be warned - the burritos are massive! I dare you to eat the whole thing in one sitting.

Buzzberry is the best locally owned coffee shop in the area! I started going last year as a student at SCC for mid-morning snacks and smoothies, and now that I'm a novice coffee drinker I can't get enough of their brews. This morning I had the pleasure of trying the red velvety latte, one of their seasonal drinks. 5 stars! It literally tastes like a liquified red velvet cupcake with caffeine. I've been there probably a dozen times and am always greeted warmly and have fantastic speedy service. I definitely recommend visiting Buzzberry if you're in the area.

I miss living up north and being just a hop, skip and a jump away from Tryst. Unfortunately, I moved to south Scottsdale and haven't made the trek to Desert Ridge for a few months.   I typically visited Tryst for brunch on the weekends. They make a mean spicy Bloody Mary complete with bacon slices and a cube or two of white cheese, along with the traditional olives, celery, lemon and lime. Whoever said they got an ungarnished Bloody Mary must have just been there on an off day?  For lunch or dinner, the ahi salad is really tasty, and a pretty good value at $13. They don't skimp on the portion of ahi. They used to have this amazing turkey burger on a pretzel bun with Brie and some kind of strawberry or raspberry jelly, but I don't think it's on the menu anymore. The Kahlua pork sandwich is yummy too.   I brought my mom here for lunch one time when she was in town visiting me and she loved it. She's really big on anything organic or locally sourced, and Tryst is both.   Hopefully I'll have an excuse to venture up north sometime soon and I can indulge again.

Do yourself a favor and try the pork belly pastrami appetizer. Or the scallops. Or better yet, both. You will thank me later.   Great ambiance without being "too much". I would recommend Citizen for a date or nice night out with the girls. If you happen to be flying solo or hanging out with the boys, the good looking gentlemen behind the bar will make you feel at home and whip you up a delicious cocktail.  I appreciate how passionately the staff talks about the food. CPH definitely gets my stamp of approval.

I think I would have enjoyed my visit to Sugar Factory much more if I had either A. Been able to order off the breakfast menu (WHY do places stop serving breakfast at 11am in Vegas?! Makes no sense to me) or B. Grabbed some confections on my way out.   I was tired, hungover and in desperate need of some carbs when my girl friend and I hit up SF on our way out of town, so I wasn't too pleased to wait 20 minutes for a table only to see so many open tables in my immediate vicinity. But whatever, moving on.   Service was fine - nothing horrible but nothing to write home about.   I ordered their signature burger for $17 which came on a scrumptious white chocolate bun. The burger itself was good but it arrived with tomatoes after I requested to have them left off, and cooked well done when I had kindly asked for medium rare. My friend ordered the French dip which she seemed to enjoy, and the spinach artichoke dip we had as a starter was good enough - not too chunky, not too runny - so all is not lost in the Sugar Factory kitchen.   Lunch for us girls including an alcoholic beverage each, an appetizer and two sandwiches came to a little over $70. I wouldn't say no to a return visit if someone suggested it, but I'm in no hurry to rush back.

I really like Stone and Vine. I think it's a great local restaurant to satisfy a martini or panini craving. Austin is my favorite bartender - he makes a mean dirty martini and caters to my high maintenance need for bleu cheese stuffed olives.   I recently had the turkey and brie panini, which was just incredible. I love anything with brie, and this sandwich may just be my favorite thing on their menu. The prosciutto panini is excellent as well. They do the bruschetta thing, similar to and just as yummy as Postino's and 5th & Wine. Entree-wise, I love that I can always count on some sort of scallop dish to be featured as a special for the week.

I recently visited Zoe's for my first time, as I was in the area and one of my coworkers constantly raves about it.   My friend and I were greeted by both friendly cashiers and given time to read the menu.  It was an oddly cold day in Arizona so we each opted for a cup of tomato bisque soup. We also both selected the turkey stack sandwich (sliced turkey breast, lettuce, feta spread, tomato, mozzarella and rosemary oil), which comes with your choice of side item. She got fruit and I tried the mayo-less slaw. I was so full from the hearty soup and the slaw that I barely got two bites taken out of my sandwich before I tapped out. :(  Everything I tried was fresh and tasty. I will definitely be back to sample more menu items.   P.S. They have the cool touch screen soda fountain for all you pop drinkers.

I was in and out in less than 15 minutes. It wasn't half the hassle I was imagining it to be (it was my first time).  Cost is $27 and some change for regular vehicles.   There's a website that shows you up-to-date wait times for all the emission testing stations in the valley. Pretty cool!

I've been to OHSO for brunch, lunch, and late night nibbles over the course of probably a dozen or so visits. I think they deserve a solid five stars. To be completely honest I am not a huge beer connoisseur, I just really like the atmosphere, the food, and the sprawling back patio.  My co-workers and I used to visit OHSO on Sundays for their $10 "Beer Brunch" which includes your choice of 10 oz. beer or large mimosa, plus a selection of ten food options under $10. My favorite items are the green chile pork carnitas (comes served with eggs) and the breakfast flatbread.  As far as appetizers go, I would recommend the spinach artichoke + crab dip or the green chile dip, although last time I had the green chile dip it could have used a tad more salt and spice.   Note-worthy sandwiches include the chicken pesto sammie and the green chile pulled pork (are you seeing a trend here - try the green chile anything, you won't regret it!)   OHSO has a pretty fabulous happy hour that runs Monday through Friday from 11am - 6pm where all wines and pitchers of beer are $6.

Great, friendly bartenders. Lots of fun bar games. Reasonably priced drinks. I'm in!  My only complaint is The Little Woody doesn't have a smoking patio, as in you have to leave your drink inside to step outside for a cig.

I used to like Paradise Bakery a lot more than I do now. They've changed their menu a bunch, and while I appreciate a menu that isn't stagnant, I found myself just staring at their chalk boards unable to find something that sounded appealing.   I ended up selecting their avocado Cobb salad and it came with like three chunks of avocado. My full size salad and a medium sized mediocre iced coffee drink ran me almost $15 after tax.  Not impressed.

I am so glad I finally stopped in to Pesto Prima before moving out of the neighborhood! I drive past it almost every day but was a little sketched out by its barren strip mall location.  The cafe itself is bright and clean. My mom and I were reading the chalkboard menu for a minute when a friendly, helpful cashier gave us brochure type menus to look at that were more detailed and had descriptions of the food items. Very nice!   I read some other reviews saying that the ingredients are relatively basic and simple, but they are correct in that everything was very flavorful. We got an order of California Toast to share which was soo yummy! I usually don't like avocado but I could eat that toast every single day. I also got a small Berry Parfait and mom got the Prima Breakfast Sandwich.   For beverages I ordered an iced dirty vanilla chai latte, per the above mentioned friendly cashier's recommendation. It was probably one of the best chai lattes I've had in the area. Mom tried the Java Mocha Blast, which I thought was similar to D'lish's Breakfast Buzz, only 10x better.  Don't let the odd location fool you, Pesto Prima is definitely a hidden gem :)

Service was great, from both the manager and the waitress. Between the two of them they were very attentive without being overbearing.   We started with the calamari appetizer and some fried cauliflower. The calamari wasn't great, I would have liked it to be a little bit more crispy, but the fried cauliflower was awesome. It didn't even taste or feel like it was fried. Super yummy and I would definitely order it again.  For entrees I had the Cuban pork sandwich, one friend had the grilled chicken sandwich and my other friends split the lobster tacos. I'm glad I didn't order the tacos because they came breaded and without a side; I would prefer the lobster not breaded and maybe with some rice or something. But my Cuban sandwich was SO good. Pork belly, ham, Swiss, pickles and some type of mayo or aioli. Delicious! I got my choice of side, fries or coleslaw, and I chose their mayo-less slaw which was tasty.   We came on a Monday which turned out to be industry night, so all 4 of us girls had cocktails, a round of shots, 2 apps and 3 entrees for $90, pre-tip. I will definitely be back to sample more from their menu.

Kelly's is my absolute favorite place in Old town. Its homey, swanky atmosphere almost makes you forget that just a mere few steps east lies the land of the douchebags. The clientele is always a pleasant mix of young professionals, the beautiful people, and a bit of an older crowd who still like to have fun.   They have a surprisingly good cocktail list as well as wine and craft beer selection. Happy hour runs 3-7 every day which includes discounted drinks and appetizers, AND half off all wine and champagne on Sundays. This makes my wallet and I extremely happy because I can indulge on some Veuve for only $60 :)  As for the food - it's amazing! I feel like people forget that Kelly's is not just a bar. Chef Izzy serves up delicious and inspired dishes. Some of my favorites include the ahi tuna tartar, the signature four cut burger (a perfect blend of chuck, sirloin, short rib and brisket), the chicken & butternut squash ravioli, and the braised short rib.   The staff is always friendly and welcoming and make you feel at home. Kelly's also offers free pool, darts, and a mini putting green. Oh and did I mention that their expansive patio won best patio in Scottsdale?! Basically, Kelly's covers all the bases and they do it well.

I've been to Searsucker twice now and I am very, very impressed.  My first visit was during one of their friends and family nights, where much to my delight everything was "on the house". My girl friend and I enjoyed a glass of white wine and one of their signature Peter Rabbit cocktails. I wasn't a huge fan of the Peter Rabbit, but to be honest I don't usually have mixed cocktails like that with dinner. Admittedly it was a little too "advanced" for my palette ;) The bartender who took care of us was very friendly and knowledgeable, and perhaps most important - not offended that I didn't care for the drink.  As far as nibbles, we sampled the "no shishito" peppers, spicy pickles, bone marrow, and eggs & bacon pork belly. I had never eaten bone marrow before and while I was intimidated a little bit, I thought it was tasty. The eggs & bacon pork belly, however, hit it out of the park. Delicious, melt in your mouth!   For our entree we shared the diver scallops. If you have read any of my other reviews, you know I am a sucker for scallops, and these were exceptional. It escapes me now what they were accompanied with, but it doesn't matter because they were so scrumptious. Just do yourself a favor and order them.  My second visit to Searsucker was on a Sunday for brunch. I was shocked to find a less than half empty restaurant, what with it being a lovely sunny day and a DJ playing fun music. Anyway, I opted for the $15 bottomless mimosa deal, while my friends sipped on some fancy-pants bloody mary's. For food I selected the "green eggs and ham" which was their infamous pork belly on brioche toast, eggs, and herb infused saucy deliciousness. Needless to say I practically licked my plate.  Service, atmosphere, and food are all excellent! A+ :)

Finally got to try P&P last night. I came in right as they were switching over to their late night menu, but I had no problem finding some options that sounded good.   I ended up ordering the pork shoulder tostadas, per the recommendation of you fellow Yelpers, and was not disappointed. They were SO good. I'm not sure if I had eaten kimchi prior to these tostadas but I liked everything that was happening in my mouth.   I like that P&P offers industry discounts and good late night eats. I will definitely be back.

Petersen's is a welcome addition to the abundance of froyo and gelato options in Old Town. Originally from outside of Chicago, this is some good quality ice cream. My favorite is the Mackinac fudge in one of their huge dipped waffle cones. Yummm.   The guys who run it are super friendly. Hi Terry! And make sure to say hi to Petey - the cutest little 3 lb ball of fluff you'll ever meet.

I'm in love. Evo's got a good thing going here, and if you haven't been yet then you need to go! Chef Chops cooked my girl friends and I such an amazing feast.   We began with the most beautiful charcuterie board, with cheeses, meats, spreads, and a bunch of yummy pickled items. Then we moved on to a delicious creamy burrata appetizer, followed by some arancini (fried risotto balls with a meat sauce), and house meatballs in a red sauce.   In between all these carbs and heavy-ish items, we sampled a beet salad as well as a broccoli stalk prepared with some pine nuts and I think a lemon sauce.   We also shared the fungi pizza, the roasted chicken entree, and one of the pasta dishes which sadly I can't remember the name of. Honestly everything was so good, there was nothing I didn't like. You can tell the staff has pride in their jobs and their products. Our server was a doll too.   If you check in on yelp you get a shot of Fireball for a penny. Which is awesome.

I never thought I would be excited about working out, but the Madison has made it possible with their awesome high energy Party on a Bike classes. Mary Kate is my favorite instructor! You can tell she puts thought and effort in to the playlist and pace of her classes. You can catch her Tuesday's and Thursday's at noon.  The only drawback for me is the price. Drop in classes are $15 plus a $2 shoe rental fee, but they offer packages that reduce the price slightly, or you can buy an unlimited monthly package for $175.

What a fun concept! I had never done anything like this before. So glad I finally got to try. It's a perfect idea for date night, girls night, or just something fun to do to get out of the house. Classes are $35 for two hours or I believe $60 for three hours (our instructor mentioned something about bringing in a photo of your pet to be painted at the three hour class?! I must look more in to this). But they offer a discount if you sign up for a future class while attending the current class.   I am by no means an artist and was a little anxious that my painting would end up looking like a 6 year old was let loose with the big kids, but the instructor walks you through the process step by step, while still encouraging individuality.   The best part is that it's BYOB. They can provide you with glasses, wine key, refrigerator etc. Also they sell wine on premises in case you forget or run out ;)  p.s. Sign up in advance via PayPal through the Art of Merlot website.

I usually don't write reviews about places until I've been there more than once, but my recent experience was so bad I feel the need to share.   We had a reservation for a surprise birthday party on a Friday night. Seated promptly, no problem. After that it went all downhill. Our first round of drinks took well over 30 minutes to hit the table. As a server I would have comped that first round, no questions asked. I ordered a martini and received a shot of warm room temperature vodka in a martini glass. Apparently they only know how to pour beers and make margaritas. Anyway. We order our meals about 20 minutes after being sat. We did not receive our entrees until an hour and a half later. My friend who made the reservation specified that she had a food allergy, received her food incorrectly, sent it back, just to have it come out wrong. Again. Everyone was done eating by the time her food came out correctly. At this point we asked to speak to a manager. He was full of excuses, saying it was a busy Friday night, blah blah blah. Don't make excuses just say sorry and fix it! He said he would "comp us a few drinks". Also they were out of carne asada, which we weren't made aware of until over an hour after we ordered when some other employee came out and asked a friend to change his order.   Honestly the food was good, which is the only reason for 2 stars. I wasn't looking for anything for free, but I was charged full price for my warm martini. The service just put a huge damper on what was meant to be a fun filled night.   Bottom line, skip this place and go to Culinary Dropout.

I used to go to this location all the time when it was Danny's, but I hadn't been back in a few years and was surprised to find out it is now Jackson's. I was also surprised that the price of the interior detail service has doubled! An interior detail + exterior wash now sets you back $120. Whatever, my car needed to be cleaned so I bit the bullet. I sure am glad I did! Even though they took longer than they had quoted me, I was extremely pleased with the final result. My car literally looks brand spankin' new! No cigarette smell, no scratches, not one speck of dust. Perfect.   Also a big shout out to Danny. He took extra special care of me and my car, and just gave really great customer service overall. He knew it was taking a bit longer than expected and made sure to check in with me multiple times while I was waiting.   I highly recommend the new and improved Jackson's and their interior detail service.

Definitely my new go-to for a quick, healthy bite. I really hope this place sticks around longer than its predecessors! Basically it's a Chipotle style format with build your own poke bowls. You start with a base of white or brown rice, mixed greens, or half and half. Then you choose your fishes (they have like 10 options! Tuna, scallops, shrimp, octopus, yellowtail etc.), then pick your sauce, and finally load it up with toppings. Everything is pretty clearly labeled so you know what your options are, plus there's little to go menus laying about so you can get a good idea of what you want before you order.  Small bowls with two scoops of fish are around $9 and large bowls with three scoops are about $11. I think it's a pretty good value considering the freshness and healthy factor. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is I think they could stand to be just slightly more generous with the scoops of fish. But other than that I love Ahi Poki and plan on visiting at least once a week. I even waited in line over 30 minutes on their official grand opening to get half price delicious ahi goodness!
