Sorry, Crazy Jim.  While your place is a popular lunch spot with downtown workers, the food is average Greek fare, at best. Had a Chicken Patra Pita. Average pita, stuffed with average chicken, grilled onions, peppers and cheese, accompanied by an undistinguished pile o' lettuce. Next time I'll try somewhere else.

Sometimes an outsider can give you a different perspective. . .  I flew in from Denver last night and got taken out to Barrio's without knowing anything about it. First thing you notice is that it's one of those white tablecloth and small neighborhood bistro-type Mexican restaurants that are cropping up all over the bigger cities in the Southwest, these days.  You know that's the case when the server comes over to offer you any one of what he claims are the 250 tequilas they have behind the bar. (!?) He describes a margarita special they're offering made with some brand I've never heard of, agave juice and freshly squeezed lime. Sounds unbelieveable, but turns out to be a tad too subtle for me, and those agave sugars are a bit slippery on my tongue.  So, while I politely acknowledge that the first one was good, I tell him, in response to his question, that I like my margaritas with Don Julio and Cointreau and ask for my next one that way.  First downer, he gets a little snooty about what a  rube I am.  Hey. Mr. Cool. I'm your customer. If I like my margarita with ketchup, your job is to give me an enthusiastic smile and ask, "one squeeze pack or two?"   Passing by the margarita moment, we start out with table-made guacamole. It's gets 3 stars for not having enough lime, salt or garlic, but still being pretty good.   They add pomegranate seeds for that bistro flair, but while it comes off as interesting, it's not as good as your well-made traditional guac.  They serve their sit-down table salsa with another somewhat contrived bistro element: bread and not chips. Roasted peppers, however, made it pretty tasty, so I'm not complaining.  On to dinner, and actually, that's what gets them up to 4 stars:  their chile en nogada,  I think they call it, was a large poblano chile stuffed with chicken, apricots, peaches (? and another "!"), garlic and almonds in a light cream sauce. Very very nice and unusual.  The server said it was a traditional dish from the Puebla area, and it was excellent and finger licking good. A bit of spice finished the dish and made it memorable.  Dessert, on the other hand, was a mediocre flan. A bit too heavy, with no subtlety at all.  Bottom line: creative food, a good attempt at bistro dining, tarnished only a little by a self-impressed server, and prices a bit on the high side. Nonetheless, I'm a fan and would go back.   When I started this review I was going to comment on how strange it was that some people gave it 5 stars and others gave it 1 star.  On reflection, I get it. This place is neat, but a bit too cocky for its own good, and that can make some people pretty upset.  My guess is that Phoenix is big enough to keep this place around for a long time, and that the food and drinks, while somewhat over-priced, will keep em coming back. Thanks, Phoenix, for a very good dining experience.

Two facts: 1) "You don't know what you've got till it's gone" and 2) Denver's gelato sucks. So how do these 2 things go together?  Found myself in Phoenix on bidness yesterday and at 100 degrees developed a craving for chocolate and tiramisu gelato. Found Gelato Spot down the street and stopped on by for a taste-orgy of both. What's weird is that if the Gelato Spot were in Denver it would be totally better than any gelato shop in the entire metro area, but in Phoenix it "only" rates 4 stars and there are half-dozen places that are rated higher.   So you Phoenix folks are totally luckin' it out living in what seems to be an incredible gelato wonderland: While we backwoods Denver hicks are stuck in the middle of a gelato Death Valley. If you lived in Denver you desert-dwellers would realize just how dessert-lucky you are. You'd have no gelato worth eating and you'd look with longing back on the days that you could just pop on in for an AZ 5 star gelato mouth-party.   I  know there's an important life lesson here--if only I could figure it out. Maybe it's that I should be more appreciative of what I can experience here in Denver or wherever I happen to be. Every place offers something special that you fully realize only when it's no longer available and sometimes . . . you (really!) don't know what you've got till it's gone.   Hmmmmmm.  Sign me,  David "Joni M" M.

Double Woohoo!  When Adonis wants to take Aphrodite out for Valentine's Day and they happen to be vacationing in Scottsdale (?) this is absolutely where he'd take her.  First off, their adobe courtyard is a stunner. Take a look at the pix~! Olympianly romantic. So if you want to impress your honey with rustic elegance you've found the golden apple of restaurants.  The dinner format is great, too. Three set courses followed by your choice of entre. We loved everything served: soup (the truffled cauliflower with beet chip and pinon garnish was about the best soup I've ever tasted . . . anywhere . . . anytime), salad and appetizer/small plate (a wonderful tempura tiger prawn with an amazing tomato chili jam) were all the same for each diner. You then had your choice of entre with a slightly variable price. Every dish was simply superb. Superb, as in memorably and unusually delicious.  Dessert rocked (my favorite = the rum cake, my sweetheart's was the flourless chocolate cake), as did the service. All in all, one of the top 10 meals I can remember having anywhere around the world. And that's a lot to say.  Sign me, David "Your faithful subject" M.  P.S. Helpful hint--Because you don't get to choose your first 3 courses, be sure to check out their menu on-line before going to make sure everything you're going to get is something you'll like and/or be able to eat. If that's not true, then have the smarts to call beforehand and make arrangements for an alternative dish so both you and the restaurant won't be placed in an uncomfortable position as the dinner progresses.

On our way from Sky Harbor to Sedona and needed a lunch break. Yelped and came across the highly rated GFG. Found it in a storefront side-strip of shops ("Good Fellas Grill" is a small part of the bigger sign, so be on the lookout). Could not believe how sweet the owner was or how great the food tasted.   No atmosphere, but awesome Middle Eastern food. Excellent lentil soup. Superb hummus that's gotta a great little kick, and baba ganoush with a wonderful smokey taste. We all shared, and they were the perfect precursors to some of the best chicken, gyros, and ground beef kabobs I can ever remember tasting.  Dollar for dollar, this place is an amazing find. I'm bummed that it's about a 1,000 miles away from where I usually have to eat lunch, but now that I know where it is, I'm going to add it to my short list of favorite area restaurants so I always know where to get some great food when out your way!
