I go to this location ALOT and yesterday I did not have a good experience. Grabbed a couple books and tried to find a table to sit in the cafe, but no seating area open at the moment. So I sat on a book aisle. About 20 mins later, a staff came by and told me I couldn't sit on the aisle. I told her the reason I sat on the floor was because there was no seating. Would I really want to sit on the floor unless I had to???? I didn't catch the lady's name, but she was an older lady. Must be having a bad day or something. But I ALWAYS sit on the floor when there are no seating and no one has ever told me to move. She walked over to the cafe and try to direct me over and pointed to a couple open tables. It was sort of rude, so I dropped off the books that I planned to purchase and left the store. I saw a bunch of people in each aisle standing and reading and she didn't seem to have a problem with that. I rate this location with 1 star due to the staff being rude.

This place had the rudest customer service, it was horrible! We came to celebrate a birthday and drove all the way from the west side of town just to try out the place. We noticed they forgot a couple dishes and we asked the server. He finally went to put in the order. We asked 3-4x about the dish and it never came out until we were done with the rest of our meal. The workers were sitting around giving each other massages when we were the only party there and never really serving us. We asked if the dish can be comped since it wasn't our fault. The server yelled at us and told us that we should have cancelled the order if we didn't want it anymore next time. I told him that there won't be a next time. On top he made a really big deal about paying with split checks. Even charged us a gratuity for something the place didn't deserve!

To sum things up, service was poor and disappointing! By the time we had food served, it was over 2 in a half hours later. This place does not have a reputation of a pizzeria bianco.   Problem #1 - We waited over an hour to get seated for a large party once everyone got here (which we were ok with, that's why we stuck around). Then when they actually seated us, our parties didn't even get to sit together.   Problem #2 - not everyone fit in the booth after waiting for so long.   Problem #3 - we waited to get the food over an hour. No one came to apologize or tell us why it was taking so long until we requested a manager. We sat down at 805, ordered by 815. Food came out at 930. Wings, pasta, sandwiches, and thin crust pizza shouldn't take over an hour. They told us the deep dish took 30-40min.   Problem #4 - we asked to speak to a manager. All she did was give me the run around and lied and bs everything. She told me food here takes an hour, especially deep dish (its written in the menu as a story - who the hell reads that shit). That's a lie, if the order went in at 850 like she said, how did we get our food earlier at 930, we should have gotten it at 950. And our order should have went in at 815. Other parties that sat 30 min later got their pastas and salads well before us. I didn't think an appetizer would take that long. She explained that they cook the pizza first then make wings, sandwiches so they are ready the same time. When I had gotten my wings, they were cold, dried, and overcook. The manager shouldn't even be running the place if she can't even service the people. They asked if we want new wings, we don't want to wait another hour for that!  Problem #5 - manager said she would comp the pizza cookies, we got charged for all that and had to complain again about the wings. The manager had to come back and talk to us again and she finally apologized (which should have been done). I don't complain unless it's reasonable enough to complain. She just didn't handle it properly the first time around. No one really ate their food. I'm sure it would have been good if food was hot and ready to eat instead of cold after waiting over an hour, then being lied to.  A week later, we took our birthday friend to The Parlor to make up for the poor Oregano's experience and it was 10x better!

Went around 5pm and sadly there was no happy hour after 5 for a mom and pop shop like this. I highly recommend extending the time slot. Food was ok, it took awhile for the food to come out when it was just our table to be served and we didn't order anything complicated. We did request fresh wasabi and was given a very small portion but charged up the alley for the amount given. Service is everything when it comes to a restaurant and the lady didn't seem that friendly. I would only go back if they had better happy hour time slot and food selection on that menu.

With Walmart being so big, they lack customer service. Pressed for assistant more than 3x at the fabric section and no one showed up. They just keep losing sales over and over. Will it ever get better??!!!! Such a disappointment.

The worst dining experience ever! It took the waitress 15 minutes to approach us for drinks. Then an hour waiting for food. We were told a cook walked out and that is why our food long. Then they told us they ran out of wings but the order still came out afterwards. 1 out of 3 orders was missing and never came out. My 2 friends got their food and I still never got my order even when they had finished their food. I sat there like a hungry kid waiting for my food. When they had finally figured it out, i just asked for it to be boxed. As we left, I didn't check the order until we got in the car and it was the wrong order! It was pretty ridiculous...

Valet was full, had to self park and pay the same price as their valet even though we were going to their club. First time at the mint and the front entrance guy said he's never heard of Yelp or the offer on the Yelp profile. Please take it down or delete your business profile from YELP. The general mgr or business owner shoulder educate this guy. Tries to sell us bottle services and we left their club in less than an hour, it just wasn't happening. Many more clubs on the block.

Very happy with the service I received from Susan. Love the fact that it was at her home business. She altered my wedding dress to make it fit my needs and it was beautiful. Highly recommended if you need any bridal alterations done!

I haven't had one good experience here. The service is always slow and each time I come, it's not like the place was packed with people. This time in particular, I was the only one in the store with just a few that walked in afterwards. I ordered 2 basic drinks and 2 orders of spring rolls. It took them 30 min to fulfill my order. My drink was super sweet and my spring rolls that I waited so long for was broken. The guy felt he needed to defend himself by telling me it only took him 15 min, and there was a couple orders before me, and that I should have called ahead to place an order (for spring rolls - an appetizer?!!!). While my receipt was time stamped and the 10 people AFTER me got their orders before me. And another thing they told me was that it's made fresh daily that's why it takes longer. No shit, I would hope it's fresh, it is called fresh spring rolls. You're not talking to a noobie. They had 3-4 people working and couldn't handle the traffic flow that I wouldn't even consider busy. If you can't handle the drink orders, why sell food that you expect people to call and order ahead? It's bad customer service if you make up excuses to a customer who waited long and couldn't even offer a free drink coupon or make up for the experience the next time around.

We sat down about 1040pm and the server informed us if anyone is under 21 by 11pm, you can't be in the restaurant. First I heard out of all zipps that I've been to. The server told us, if we ordered food before 11pm, then we can't get kicked out while eating our food. We placed our order before 11 and didn't get our food until almost 1115pm. Then the manger comes and tell us that we only have until 1130pm to eat and leave. This is ridiculous bc they are telling us one thing, then another. I don't see how we can enjoy our food in less than 15 min. Especially when we clarified things to begin with. Otherwise we would have walked out and brought our business to a better restaurant. Coming from a business perspective, the staffs should have been trained to explain the law. We could have ordered food to go. But we were mislead that we could order and eat there. Food should have been comped to make things right instead of having customers walk out angry. Great food, bad service! Don't bring your kids here!!!

At first I thought this place was awesome...then they sell you on a wristband package to be able to do unlimited activities there. Sounds great right? But you don't know what surprise you're in for! We had a group of 5 all purchasing the wristband spending about $125.   A couple reasons why this place is getting a bad review. 1) it's not even busy and they tell you 2 hour waiting listen to bowl. 2) it's not really convenient to order food and keep getting moved around and move lanes if you're bowling. 3) no one really has all day to get on a wait list, so that is where they rip off your party. 4) the service is just ok 5) it's actually cheaper paying for what you want to play. For example, we bowled 3x, it would have only been $90 average instead of getting the wristband.   It's not busy and they make you wait 2 hours! Wow! Rip off! See the photo!

Came here for lunch, their lunch menu was very affordable and lots of options to choose from. If you want sushi or something hot off the grill, this is a great lunch place. Traffic is very busy off bell but restaurant is very quiet during lunch hours. Although restaurant wasn't very busy, servers need to be a little attentive to customers. All together, great menu for lunch and choices for happy hour. Big rooms to cater to big party as well.

Restaurant was very clean in a nice setting playing lao music. The service was great. I requested a lot of little things like diced Thai chilli sauce to go with my pad see ew and they made it for me. We ordered a variety of items from papaya salad, wings, Thai iced coffee, noodle dishes and everything turned out great. Their portions are very large. Love this place and will be happy to come back!

I thought this was a neat little place when I first entered. Asked to order a simple coconut smoothie with boba and got asked 5 different questions before completing the order. Never has that happened at any other boba/tea place. My drink turned out so nasty and did not taste like a typical coconut smoothie. They told us they ran out of coconut flavor and then told us they had it. Maybe they used something else to try to make up for what they didn't have? Not sure if I would come back again. Even in the photo it looks completely off.
