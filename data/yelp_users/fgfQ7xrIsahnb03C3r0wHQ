I am disabled. Every time I have gone in there the power chairs have broke down. Then the guy at the register was rude and seemed like he hated his job. Been in a few times each time was a disappointment... I'll drive the extra distance and go to Fry's or Safeway...

Had my I.D checked twice, then had to sign a book . My chips were never refilled I had to ask. The hostess is old as a dinosaur and gave me a hard time when I asked to sit in the lounge with my child. Service used to be great, but it has really gone down hill. I won't be back.

I love this place! I come in at least 5 days a week!  I do their Hot Yoga,  I am down 12 pounds in 8 weeks!  The staff is awesome,  and VERY professional!  I recommend Planet Beach to all my friends!  Come check it out! You won't be disappointed!

Servers were afraid to come to our table, Rian finally came to our table once I had to stock him down. My beers were empty for over 20 minutes, he walked around to everyone else to fill sodas, but my beer wasn't important. Other then  bad service food was also a disappointment, had their "Carne quest dip" was terrible, taste like something I would of had from Taco Bell... Meat taste like breakfast sausage. Once my beer was empty, for over 20 minutes, I had to stock down Rian again for our tab... Had money to spend, unfortunately, my whole experience was disappointment... I won't be back, and definitely won't recommend to anyone!
