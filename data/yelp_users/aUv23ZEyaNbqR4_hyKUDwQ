Sadly, I have not been impressed with the Chinese food offered here in Phoenix.   I had high hopes for Desert Jade and was hoping the food had improved from Gabi's 3-star review back in 2009, but I was not impressed and it seems that the reviews range widely here.   The three food items we tried tasted fresh, but were seriously lacking in flavor.   The Wor Won Ton Soup came with a generous serving of shrimp, pork, and beef pieces and vegetables, but the wontons were dense balls of dough that, as another reviewer mentioned, tasted more like gnocchi rather than meat-filled wontons.   The Beef with Broccoli came with the thinest sauce I've ever had that had the flavor and consistency of beef broth. The beef was a tad overcooked and the broccoli was limp from being overcooked.   The Chicken Chow Mein was the biggest disappointment as I was looking forward to the big, fat soft noodles that I have enjoyed and every other Chinese restaurant I've ever dined!! The lady on the phone said "Pan fried?" when I ordered, which I guess I was supposed to know meant, "Be prepared for thin, vermicelli-type noodles." Again, no real flavor to the chow mein dish, though the chicken was tender.   On the plus side, the service was friendly and the food was ready quickly. I just wish the food was up to par with the service.

The Día de los Muertos event at the Desert Botanical Garden (DBG) was fantastic this year; however, the food catered by this company was certainly not "fabulous." The food was average at best and certainly overpriced for the quality.   The catered menu for the DBG celebration consisted of a fairly limited menu of chips & salsa, and a choice of either Machaca Tacos (shredded beef) or Fish Tacos. There may have been one salad option, too.   The chips were fresh and the salsa was delicious, but seemed a little overpriced at $4.50 for a small serving. The Machaca Taco plate came with a side of rice and refried black beans for $13.95. The shredded beef was tender and had good flavor, but the rice was cold and the refried beans were dried out and lacking flavor. Also, the Horchata tasted like sweet milk and was seriously lacking in spice - who forgot the cinnamon?!   Besides the lackluster food, I was also disappointed by the lack of professionalism and attitude of the catering crew. This was a cool event to cater, but they all looked bored.   Based on this experience trying a meal catered by FF and interacting with their staff, I would not hire them in the future.

After attending the Grand Re-Opening, my view of this store has certainly improved. The experience was great and not just because I got free food samples and a booklet of coupons, though those were good too!   The store underwent a seriously facelift inside and has expanded several sections. Now, there is a larger pharmacy section and an expanded liquor section. More exciting, for me, was the fact that they have an expanded organic and local produce section and half of an aisle devoted to gluten-free products. I was also surprised to see the large Starbucks display in the coffee aisle.   In my experience, Safeway can't match Sprouts in terms of the quality or price of produce, but it's still good for other items. Overall, I enjoy shopping at this store and appreciate the friendly service.

My husband knows I LOVE breakfast and brunch, so he was happy to treat me to breakfast before we enjoyed a relaxing day of visiting the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art (SMoCA) and walking around Old Town.   Word has definitely gotten out about this "hidden gem" in Scottsdale because when we called on Sunday, there was a 45 minute wait! Orange Table is close to the SMoCA and the SF Giants spring training ballpark so I can understand why it was so popular and crowded on that particular morning. No problem, we showed up around 1p after the morning rush and were quickly seated at a table.   Orange Table offers their breakfast menu all day and lunch 11-4p so there's something for everyone. Luckily for me, my hubby was on board with sharing our dishes so I got to try both the sweet and savory dishes on the menu.   He ordered the "White Flannel" (Corned Beef + Potatoes + Mushrooms + Onions) with Sourdough Toast. They were quite flexible and allowed him to order one scrambled egg (for him) and a sunny side up egg (for me). The White Flannel was a hearty dish with tender pieces of corned beef, perfectly prepared eggs, and two thick slices of toast. Overall, great dish, a generous serving, and excellent value for $10.   The SMoCA mocha is made with espresso + chocolate + amaretto flavoring + raspberry flavoring - what could be more delicious?! Surprisingly, the SMoCA wasn't overly sweet; however, I wished the raspberry and amaretto notes were a little stronger. Although my husband found the mocha quite tasty and he doesn't even like coffee, so what do I know? I guess I like my coffee like I like my dessert: SWEET! :)  The "Banana Nut Pancakes" ($12.50) came with two banana and pecan pancakes. The bites with banana and toasted pecan pieces were good, but the bites without banana didn't have much flavor. I appreciate that the pancakes are served with 100% maple syrup as my husband is allergic to syrup that contains corn syrup. This dish also comes with your choice of bacon, sausage, prosciutto cotto or fruit. We ordered the bacon which was just "okay"; next time I'll probably go with the fruit option.   Overall: this is a nice place for brunch that offers reasonably priced dishes, a cute patio dining area to enjoy when the weather is nice, and Orange Table is the perfect place to stop before visiting the museums in the area.

Excellent customer service and friendly, knowledgeable staff! I've been coming here for over 5 years and have always received superior dental treatment.   I was worried about finding a new dentist when I first moved to Arizona. Thankfully, Old Town Dentistry accepts several dental plans, including the Aetna Vital Savings Plan that is so "generously" provided to ASU graduate students. While I wish ASU provided full dental coverage, I have still been able to receive excellent dental care thanks to Old Town Dentistry. I appreciate that Doc. Brittain and his staff take a conservative approach and never pressure me for unnecessary dental work. They have always informed me of all my options and offered preventive steps as a first course of action rather than jumping to more costly treatments.   Just one example of how the team here go above and beyond: every time I visit, the staff ask how I'm doing and what's new in my life. When Doc. Brittain found out that I was engaged and planning my wedding, he offered to bring both my husband and I in for a complimentary teeth whitening - what a thoughtful and generous pre-wedding gift!  Check out Old Town Dentistry - you'll be glad you did! And say, "Hi" to Dallas at the front desk - she's fantastic!

I've been to a number of Einstein's Bagels, but this one really stands out above the rest.   Excellent customer service! A staff member named Chelsea welcomed every single customer in the store and seemed genuinely happy to see them. When she wasn't busy behind the counter taking breakfast orders, she was switching out the freshly brewed coffee, wiping down tables, and asking guests how their meal was.   I ordered a breakfast sandwich and medium coffee - both were delicious and quickly prepared. The coffee bar was clean, well stocked, and the coffee carafes were full which I appreciated. The egg whites, mushrooms, asparagus, and Swiss cheese where delicious on a toasted garlic bagel.   This location has a great neighborhood feel - a few customers greeted one another while enjoying their breakfast and Chelsea even knew several regular customers by name! Such a welcoming and friendly vibe here. I usually frequent the Tempe location which is heavily populated with students with laptops and iPods who mostly avoid eye contact, so it was refreshing when an older gentleman said good morning to me when he sat down at the next table.    Come here to enjoy a tasty breakfast in a relaxing and welcoming environment.

Reading the reviews it is clear that there is serious East Coast loyalty for Dunkin Donuts - regardless of the customer service and quality at this specific location.   People, please keep in mind: this is not an Edward vs Jacob decision, that is clearly important but subjective. No, we're talking about coffee and there ARE in fact metrics we can use to evaluate (and should use) to make our morning beverage decisions. Specifically, quality and customer service.   1. Quality  The donuts here don't taste all that fresh, at least to me. I'll have one and then wonder why because it wasn't all that delicious. I much prefer the donuts at Krispy Kreme or Bosa Donuts to the ones at Dunkin Donuts.   As for the coffee, it tastes somewhat watered down in my opinion. It's not all that strong and doesn't have much flavor. When I order my morning coffee, it would be nice to have the choice of different roasts rather than whatever generic coffee flavor was just brewed.  2. Customer Service This is were this DD location really misses the boat and is the reason why I will not be returning. This location is poorly designed with too little space inside to have a counter with chairs right along side the double line of people that forms in the morning. Encountering a line is one thing, but I don't appreciate feeling rushed through the line and barked at with the line, "What are you drinking?" At least at Starbucks and Dutch Bros the staff say, "Good morning," or express some pleasantries before just asking for my order. I also am disappointed that this location does not have carafes with milk. Asking how many sugars and half and half I want makes me feel like I'm giving my order to a flight attendant and then I panic thinking to myself, "What if that's not enough? What if I change my mind?" I have two hands and I'd like to decide how much cream and sugar to add to my own coffee, thank you!

"How glorious a greeting the sun gives the mountains!" - John Muir   Echo Canyon Trail is challenging, but so worth it once you reach the top of Camelback Mountain!   If you'd like some company on your hike, I'd encourage you to reach out to Brett B. - an awesome Elite Yelper in Phoenix - because he's hiking Camelback just about every weekend and has some great tips from scouting the mountain during his climbs.   Here are the items that Brett instructed me to bring for my first climb up Camelback: 1) At least 1L of water ideally in a backpack with a bladder bag and drinking spout to keep your hands free for hiking 2) A snack (e.g., banana or energy bar) to keep your energy up for the hike  3) Gum to keep your mouth from getting dry 4) Sunscreen - be sure to spray *before* the hike! 5) Hat - optional depending on weather  6) Chapstick - your lips can get dry while hiking 7) Hiking shoes with good traction (Note: kids may be okay with sneakers, but make sure they have tread - no Converse or skateboarding shoes!) 8) Thick socks or 2 pairs of socks for padding between feet and shoes. You don't want your feet to rub against shoes, plus you want to keep feet dry to prevent blisters.  9) Gloves with padding. These are not necessary, but I highly recommend as they are helpful for holding on to the rail during the steep ascent and for climbing over boldest so you don't tear up your hands.   We met at the Echo Canyon Trail at 6:45AM to stretch and start up the mountain by 7am. It was an early morning, but it was definitely worth it as there was plenty of parking at this time and we avoided the large crowds on the trails that appear later in the morning.   You should plan about an hour up the mountain and about 45 minutes to an hour down the mountain. We went at about this pace, which was comfortable and allowed time for water breaks and photos along the trail. (Team mantra: "Photos or it didn't happen!")   Here's another website with more details that may be helpful:  http://www.everytrail.com/guide/camelback-mountain  Have fun and post photos!

Sauce was a delightful place to enjoy lunch with friends after a grueling hike up Piestewa Peak.   I have been really impressed with all of the other Fox Restaurant Concepts, so I was excited to finally try Sauce and see if it was on par with the others. Short answer: YES, this fresh Italian restaurant has something unique and delicious to offer!   It's not on the menu, but here's a little secret a friend shared: You can create your own half and half lunch combo! I ordered a half salad and bowl of soup which was perfect!   The Tuscan Tomato Soup was warm, full of flavor and perfect for dipping the complimentary warm bread roll.   The Golden Beet Salad with Quinoa, pistachios, avocado, goat cheese and other amazing goodness was in a word DELICIOUS! Seriously, if you like beets - you have to try this salad!  You can thank me later ;)  The service here was great. Staff were friendly - even came over to ask how our hike was and about my friend's FitBit fitness band. They even gave us an extra bread roll to enjoy later with our leftovers.   I'll definitely be back! There's just too much good stuff on the menu - I want to come back and try it all!

The food at Cornish Pasty is unique, freshly made, and delicious! For the vegetarians, I highly recommend The Greek ($8.50) and the Balsalmic Portobello ($9) - both are flaky, delicious and oh so flavorful! My mates enjoy the more traditional meat and gravy pasties and rave about The Oggie (steak + potatoes) and The Royale with Cheese so there's something for everyone and you really can't go wrong!  Service Very attentive and friendly. Relaxed yet polite servers. The waiter kept a close eye on our beverages and offered refills on our water. I'm always concerned going with a large group to dinner about the check because rarely do I carry extra cash and some restaurants make a fuss about splitting checks. Thankfully, splitting checks isn't an issue at Cornish Pasty. Our server happily complied with our request without batting an eye. The service was excellent so we were fine leaving a little extra gratuity since it made splitting the bill easier. Our waiter was jubilant over the slightly more than 20% gratuity, which just underscores that this is not one of those fancy, pretentious restaurants that expects a generous tip.   Physical space Beware: The restaurant is NOT visible from street when driving down University. When I finally found the restaurant around the corner and walked up, the windows were black and it appeared as if it was closed. Fret not - it IS in fact open! Apparently the restaurant also recently expanded and friends who had visited the restaurant previously were impressed with the remodel. The bathroom was the one place that suggested more of a pub and college feel. On the bathroom walls I found strange graffiti art. Some inscriptions may have been written by Lady Gaga during her carnivorous costume days or a confused co-ed (e.g., "I am meat"). In any event, once you find the hidden restaurant delicious pasties and friendly service are just a few steps away!

Tonight I visited AMC Desert Ridge theater for the first time. I've never thought to visit this location since it's outside my neighborhood and quite a ways north, but I decided to make the trek since they were having a special screening of a documentary at this location.   I convinced some friends to venture up north to see what Desert Ridge had to offer and we were all pleased with what we found. The theater was clean, the bathrooms were well-attended, and the seats in the theater were quite comfortable. We arrived just before the show started so we grabbed seats in the top back row. Just like sitting in front of the Emergency Exit row on an airplane, there's a price for siting in the back row of the theater: non-reclining seats!   The reclining issues in the back row and the   standard movie theater thermostat setting of "cold to freezing" aside, this is a great theater and I will definitely be back! There are numerous places nearby to dine before or after a movie and the theater itself has much to offer.   In case you're curious, the documentary was called "Free the Mind" and is about the health benefits and science behind mindfulness. In all honesty, the documentary was "light" on the science and research piece, but I found the stories touching and encouraging in terms of the innovative and non-pharmacological strategies depicted in the film to help veterans and children cope with challenging situations and learn to regulate their emotions. I highly recommend seeing the documentary if you have the opportunity!

Woohoo! As good as it gets! And, yes, I'm talking about a US Post Office.  The Van Buren Street US Post Office will have you in and out lickety-split and I guarantee leaving with a smile on your face!   I'm fortunate that this Post Office happens to be in my neighborhood, but I'd seriously drive out of my way to receive awesome customer service and avoid the inevitable lines and headache at other locations.  The employees at this location are always so friendly, which makes it actually enjoyable to visit the Post Office! All of the employees seem to enjoy and take pride in their work, which shows in their interactions with the customers. The other day Terry saw my ASU card and said, "Go Devils!" I didn't hear her and thought there was something wrong with my card so I mumbled, "Huh?" Then she smiled and gave me the Sun Devil Pitchfork hand sign - how awesome is that?!   10 Reasons this Location is the Best  0. They have Harry Potter Forever Stamps! (okay, just a bonus reason) 1. Ample parking spaces 2. Friendly greeter who always says, "Have a nice day!"  3. Fully stocked mailing supplies and good selection of greeting cards 4. Extended hours:  Mon-Fri 8:00am - 9:30pm; Sat 10:00am - 5:00pm  5. Knowledgeable employees help customers save money  6. Multiple customer service lanes means short wait times even with long lines! 7. Employees are friendly and seem to enjoy providing excellent customer service 8. U.S. Passport Office and Photo service 9. Drive-by mail drop option for stamped mail 10. Lobby is open 24/7 for around the clock access to P.O. Boxes

I enjoyed a delicious meal here for a UYE lunch event. The restaurant was very accommodating for our party of 11 and provided excellent service - keeping our water glasses filled and ensuring all of our meals arrived at the same time.   I enjoyed the Thai Braised Beef Tacos ($11.95) during a previous visit and they were just as delicious this time as I remembered! The 4 tacos have the perfect combination of spicy and sweet braised beef rib meat on corn tortillas with Asian hot sauce and tangy slaw. The tacos are accompanied by jalapeño slices and sweet pickles for those who want to "kick it up a notch."   All of my dining companions seemed equally pleased with the mac 'n cheese, burger, salad, and lobster & seafood crepes.   I will definitely return to Switch for the variety of entree options, cocktails, and great service. This is a great restaurant for a number of occasions - a birthday lunch, romantic brunch on the patio, or dinner with friends.

Los Cerritos serves up the best California Burrito in the area! The burrito itself is HUGE and stuffed with well-cooked and seasoned carne asada, potatoes, grilled onions, melted cheese, and some herbs and seasoning that make this like no other burrito. All this in a freshly made tortilla for only $4.99!   When we have a craving for Mexican food, we'll drive past the several other closer restaurants to visit Los Cerritos because the burritos are that good. I wasn't too impressed with the crunchy shredded beef taco, but the rice and beans were good and the lettuce was fresh. Now, I just stick to the burritos because they know how to make a mean burrito!   Like Roland W. and Stephen B. mentioned, sure this place doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't judge until you've tasted the food. The staff here are always friendly and take their time preparing the meal (not just thrown together in 30 seconds in a tortilla like they do at the fast food chains).   Los Cerritos is a small casual restaurant that serves up some tasty Mexican food!

I'm a regular visitor of this Starbucks and always have a great experience. I love that this location has a Drive Thru so I can cruise through on my way to work. This is a popular location so don't be surprised if there's a line in the morning, but they really do a great job of quickly crafting your beverage and getting people through the line. All the baristas are nice and friendly, but John is my absolute fave - just so upbeat even when I'm half asleep in the morning!   This location is one of the lucky ones to be among the first to offer bakery items from La Boulange. La Boulange is a San Francisco bakery and café that has been serving artisanal pastries, and great food since 1996 and recently partnered with Starbucks. The Pecan Tart and Morning Bun are my favorite!

This review is for the Sears Optical Center. *Tip: Sears Optical accepts most vision insurance and discount programs.*  The customer service in the Optical Center is great if you need glasses at a great price. Crystal is the friendliest person behind the counter and so helpful when people are picking out glasses and trying to find a good deal. She helped several people while I was waiting for my husband to complete his eye exam and I was impressed by her cheerful attitude and professionalism.   Dr. Tran is the independent optometrist at this Sears. Whereas most offices are closed on the weekends, Dr. Tran offers appointments on Saturdays which is great. Dr. Tran was personable, extremely knowledgeable, and took her time with the exam.   Mary and Crystal are incredibly knowledgeable and helpful as well when it comes to selecting the perfect pair of glasses. The selection is somewhat limited at Sears, but they do offer some good brands and amazing deals. Current deal: 50% off one pair glasses or buy 2 pairs and receive 60% off the second pair (Sale effective through 1/7/14).

Visited Aloha Yogurt to celebrate our softball team's second win of the season. Aloha was cool enough to sponsor our team and get us brand new t-shirts so we thought we'd stop by for a visit. No special treatment - we still paid for our yogurt, but I was able to cash in my Yelp BOGO offer - sweet! Will have to come back here on a Thursday night when the BOGO offer is in full effect ALL DAY!   The flavor selection here is LEGEND...wait for it... DAIRY! Loved the "Blood Orange" and "Pomegranate Raspberry" - which was dairy free and delicious. Everyday they feature 12 custom flavors and over 45 toppings so the possibilities are endless. It's nice that they always have in rotation a plain and a flavored tart flavor, No Sugar Added, and Dairy Free. You can find out the current selection of flavors by visiting their Facebook page: www.facebook.com/AlohaYogurt.   I love that Aloha is open to suggestions on future flavors, toppings, etc. and that they have a poll in store where customers can vote on new flavors! "Sunshine Lemon" was in the lead tonight, but I really hope the "Snickers" flavor comes from behind for the win!   Aloha Yogurt was established by two friends and entrepreneurs who earned their degrees from Arizona State University and the University of San Diego. I'd much rather come here for my froyo fix and support a locally owned business over a chain any day!

I was nervous about finding a new eye doctor when I moved to Arizona and didn't think I'd find one as amazing as the Shiley Eye Care Center at UC, San Diego. After putting off my annual eye check up, I finally decided it was time to test the waters and see what Arizona had to offer. Thankfully my fellow Yelpers led me to the Valley Eyecare Center and I couldn't be happier!   I like that Valley Eyecare Center uses the latest technology to provide excellent service to their patients. The doctors and staff are warm and caring and take the time to actually listen to my concerns and questions. For example, at my last eye exam Dr. Eric Clyde and his staff understood that I couldn't afford the additional cost of the retina scan option, but also knew my time was valuable and I couldn't get through my day in front of the computer if I had to have my eyes dilated so they offered the retina scan and waived the additional cost. When I was recently fitted for contacts I struggled to get them in, but Dr. Clyde was patient and his assistant came into the room to help offer some tips and reassurance. Since I don't have vision coverage with my health insurance plan, I'm glad that they accept the Aetna VSP (Vital Savings Plan). I'm so glad that I found Valley Eyecare Center!

Bienvenidos a Tacos Sahuaro - enjoy authentic Mexican street tacos without leaving Phoenix!  The restaurant is nothing fancy, but it has plenty of seating inside and most importantly serves up delicious tacos for only $2 each. The tacos are made with with two freshly cooked tortillas, your choice of meat, chopped onions and cilantro. The tacos are also served with a selection of fresh veggies to cleanse the palate - sliced cucumber, picked carrots, onions, and jalapeños if you want to kick it up a notch. The green chile and red salsa were good, but not the best I've ever had.   At the suggestion of other Yelpers, I tried the Al Pastor, Carne Asada, and the Carnitas Tacos. The three tacos were quite filling because they come double wrapped in two tortillas. The Carne Asada Taco didn't have a lot of flavor on its own - probably would've been good with some fresh guacamole - but the Al Pastor Taco was delicious!   Also, if you order a Coca Cola be prepared for "un medio litro - that's half a liter! They didn't have Horchata when we visited, but they have a wide selection of Jarritos drinks (mango, tamarindo, lime).

Street Eats 2015 featured more than 50 Food Trucks, Cooking Demos & Live Music!  The festival was still sponsored by New Times, but they had new organizers this year. Before judging the event on reviews from prior years, read the details and determine for yourself whether you'll be joining me to attend the next event in November 2015 :D  Venue: Salt River Fields at Talking Stick  Dates: February 7-8, 2015, 11am-6pm, each day  Price: $12/person (We purchased discounted tickets on LivingSocial.com for $6/person)   Street Eats featured an impressive array of food trucks - from chicken satay and Navajo fry bread to lobster grilled cheese and duck sliders - you're bound to find something appetizing!   How to Have a Good Time:  Bring cash (avoid ATM fees!), an appetite, a friend to chat and dance with while you're in line, and some patience - the lines move slowly during peak hours (12-2p). You may also want to bring sunscreen (check the weather before hand!) and some H20 because bottles of water inside are $2 each.   How the festival works: Once inside the festival, you can purchase tokens worth $2 each. These will be used instead of cash at the bars - you'll also need to show ID to get your 21+ wristband. At the food trucks, you can use tokens, cash, or credit cards (most trucks take all forms of payment). Trucks try to serve a $2 "sample option" so you can try as many trucks as possible, but if you want a full meal be prepared for entree prices in the range of $10-16.   The Maine Lobster Lady has quite a following and took the prize for longest line (1.5 hours!) and the most expensive entree - $21.50 for Fried Maine Whole Belly Clam Roll!  The Lobster Mac & Cheese ($16 entree/$6 sample) by Mac's Concession was another popular dish that a friend sampled.   I came with $18 to spend and stayed within my budget, while still being able to sample a variety: marinated and moist Chicken Satay with Peanut Sauce from the Satay Hut ($4), slice of Wood-Fired pizza ($6) from The Rocket by NORTH Italia (FRC food truck), and a refreshing handmade Mexican pineapple popsicle ($4) by Paletta's Betty for dessert!   Bottom line: you CAN spend a ton of money if you select the most expensive options at the festival, but you can also enjoy sampling different items and leave without burning a hole in your wallet. The drinks are expensive ($4 beers, $6 cocktails) so come prepared and have a good time spending as much or as little as you choose. There are LOTS of options!

Recently, I enjoyed a delicious lunch at the Sauce restaurant in Phoenix so I decided to check out what this airport location had to offer. I figured it had to be better than the peanuts and pretzels the airline would offer, right? And oh boy was it better!   You can order and pay with the hostess or at the counter which helps speed up the ordering process for those needing to rush off to their gate.   *Caprese Salad with Crostini* The salad came with cubes of fresh  mozzarella, diced tomatoes, freshly toasted crostini pieces, and mesclun (assorted small, young salad leaves). The fresh balsamic vinaigrette was the perfect pairing with the salad. I wasn't too hungry and found the half size portion to be just perfect!  I love that all the menu items come with a fresh baked roll and pat of butter - perfect for dipping in soup as I saw other guests enjoying.   All in all, quite pleased with the reasonable prices, friendly servers, cleanliness of the restaurant, and healthy food options. Did I mention this is inside the airport?!

Kelly's at SouthBridge is my favorite happy hour spot in Old Town Scottsdale! With so many great appetizers all half-priced from 3-7p, you can't go wrong.   I'm a bit overdue in writing this review, but I still have fond memories of the fun evenings and happy hours spent here and couldn't keep this to myself any longer.   One of the great things about Kelly's is that they have happy hour EVERYDAY! Monday to Saturday from 3-7pm and ALL DAY Sunday you can enjoy 50% off appetizers, $4 drafts/wine/well drinks, and $4 off signature cocktails.   The appetizers at Kelly's are delicious and the happy hour menu offers a number of great drink options!   Our favorite appetizers are the Haloumi Stuffed Cherry Peppers ($4, HH) and Roasted Brussels Sprouts ($5, HH). These are so good we ordered them every time we came! Definitely recommend trying these two dishes, especially at the happy hour price you can't go wrong!   For heartier appetites, I recommend the Short Rib Tacos - very tasty and great value at $6 during HH! And of course, Kelly's Original Four-Cut Burger ($14) is not to be missed for dinner. My friend raves about the perfect combination of short-rib, sirloin, chuck, and brisket, served with onion relish and Comté cheese. Try it and see what you've been missing!    The bartenders have a heavy hand - good news! Except if you like a sweeter drink (like me) take note! My Old Fashioned ($8, HH) was so strong I had to "water it down" with club soda. I'm such a wuss. I don't know why I'm complaining, but unless you can handle straight whiskey, I'd suggest skipping this drink and trying one of the other creative cocktails options!

After hearing about the creative and delicious dishes at Pig & Pickle and learning about the Chefs' commitment to local produce, handcrafted cocktails, homegrown herbs, and fresh baked breads, I was excited to finally visit P&P to celebrate a friend's birthday.   Our server, Cat, was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She was encouraging of us trying new things without being "pushy" which was quite refreshing. We ordered a round of cocktails and everyone was quite pleased with the humorously named drinks: "Red Headed Stepchild" (which came with a Sour Patch Kid!), "Salty Dog" (vodka, black/white hawaiian sea salts, fresh grapefruit) and the "Maggie" (homemade triple-sec and Hawaiian Sun strawberry/passionfruit juice - delicious but not too sweet). I ordered the "Bramble On" (gin, blackberry, lime juice, soda) because it sounded creative and refreshing, but since I'm not a "gin girl" I didn't find it quite as tasty as the other drinks.   The favorite appetizers that the group tried were the Pork Belly Tostadas ($9 for two large tostadas) and the Fried Brussels Sprouts with Asiago and a Farm Fresh Egg ($7). The Butternut Squash Soup with toasted pepitas was so delicious that I was glad that I had a small bowl for myself that I didn't have to share!   A specialty item on the menu tonight was Trotter Stuffed with Fennel Sausage. "Pied de Cochon," as this delicacy is known in France, is French for Pigs' Trotters or Pigs' Feet - yep, feet! Not surprisingly, this part is typically thrown away by butchers, but apparently this can be quite appetizing when it's prepared correctly (bones removed, cooked for hours, etc.). I don't love pork, so I passed on the opportunity to try this dish. The meat-lovers in the group tried the stuffed trotter and were disappointed that it wasn't quite as tender as expected, though they raved about the fennel sausage and the raspberry sauce that accompanied the dish. Our server noticed that most of the dish was left untouched and when she heard it wasn't quite as expected, she apologized and took it off our bill.   The main dishes were the the show stoppers of the night! The Golden Beet Salad ($9) was artfully presented and deliciously prepared with candied pecans, watercress, bleu cheese crema, and pomegranate seeds. The sandwiches or "sammies" come with your choice of fries, small "dump truck" salad, or tots for an extra $1. With all the other appetizers, two people split the "Nancy" (brie, avocado, tomato and shaved red onion on garlic rubbed bread) and were quite satisfied with the sammie and salad.   The birthday girl selected the "Chocolate Mud Cake" for dessert, which was beautifully presented with a candle and chocolate garnish on the side. The chocolate cake was moist, rich and delicious with a hint of sea salt that was nicely paired with a scoop of butter pecan ice cream.   After a fun birthday celebration that excited our taste buds, I'd love to come back to P&P to sample more of the menu and enjoy the happy hour pricing (4-6 pm daily).

My favorite new find in Tempe? The Original ChopShop Co!   I don't know how this place has eluded me since it's opening in February, but I found this "diamond in the rough" that is Mill Ave (amongst the bars and burger joints).The restaurant was founded on the belief that you CAN eat healthy on-the-go "without sacrificing fresh, memorable flavors or affordability" which I may have previously doubted, but after trying ChopShop I'm a BELIEVER!   After trying a refreshing fresh pressed juice last week for the first time, I was excited to  return and check out the lunch menu. The reviews on Yelp and photos just seemed too good to be true. Could such a place really exist? After trying the lunch menu, I would say yes - it's THAT good! I had the Tofu Teriyaki Bowl ($7) and a small seasonal Lemonade ($2). My friend had the Kale Caesar with Chicken ($9) and an Arnold Palmer. Both dishes were incredibly flavorful and the drinks were refreshing. The portions were quite generous and we both had leftovers for that we could look forward to for later.   In case you're wondering what Forbidden Rice is, like I was, let me share what I learned. No, they're not being cheeky by calling it "forbidden" - there is such a thing. According to LotusFoods (rice distributor), Forbidden Rice provides the richest nutritional value, providing a higher level of vitamins, minerals and fiber of any bran rice, as well as a comprehensive range of amino acids, proteins, vegetable fats and essential trace elements needed by the body. Now, you know!  As others have noted, the ambiance both inside and outside of the restaurant is relaxed, comfortable, and urban chic. The patio is the perfect lunch date spot or place to work (in the late afternoon after the lunch crowd). Can't wait to return and try the breakfast menu!
