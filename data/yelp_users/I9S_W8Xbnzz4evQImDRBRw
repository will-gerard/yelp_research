had a horrible experience with the owner of c & h. tried for more than 6 months to get something resolved and then when we finally got it resolved he really screwed us around and did not stick up to his word. stay away!

Great place.  Highly recommend. Friendly people.   Great food and excellent lay out. When you have a wife and son that can't do dairy this place is an excellent place to get dairy free and gluten free things.

Great attributes and they do a great job.  Much better than when it used to be Danny's.
