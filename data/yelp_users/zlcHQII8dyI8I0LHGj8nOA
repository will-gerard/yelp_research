Been here multiple times...busy or not busy, service is ALWAYS slow. Tables are available but no one seems to want to clean them. Dirty tables are always present when I come, yeah very appealing. A larger party came after us and got seated first. Rude. Food is ok. Probably the last time I'm coming here.

It's been almost a year since there was a review about this place.   I thought this place was pretty affordable and cheap compared to other Pho places here in AZ. Large portions too.   I had their #15 Pho, meatballs and sliced beef. The broth tasted like chicken or like those Pho broths from the can you can buy at Asian supermarkets. I pretty much drowned it with hoisen and chili sauce just to make it almost taste like the Pho most people know. The bean sprouts they gave us were kind of dry and still had the "little brown roots" on the end. Never saw that before in a restaurant. The meat didn't look too fresh either.  The restaurant is on the small side, but is spacious. I found the Boss Lady sitting at one of the back tables facing the whole dining area a little creepy. Their waitress looked like she just woke up and rolled out of bed! Lol. Omg, a minute into having our food served, I heard someone clipping their nails! I was tempted to look around but I was afraid I would totally lose my appetite. Gross. Do that at home. Not at your restaurant.   I'm not so sure if I would go back. I probably only will if I was really really REALLY craving for some Pho, and it's the only one near my work.   They are closed on Tuesdays and is Cash Only.

Pretty fast drive thru unless it's lunch hour like any other place. Employees are pleasant. Can't say anything about the dining inside as I've never been there lol

If it wasn't for the cute shopping cart of fries, they'd get a one star. Went in an hour after they opened today so it wasn't busy at all. All the servers and host were standing around looking bored out of their mind. My server was nowhere to be found so I waved down a server that was standing right next to me with nothing to do, he shook his head at me and replied "I'm not your server," and went back to staring at the damn ceiling before asking if he could help me with anything. I couldn't read his name tag but I think his name was Ali or ali-something. Finally my server showed up after a few minutes and took my order. If it wasn't for my friend wanting to try this "popular" place, I would had walked out of there. Overall, service was below a one star.  As for the food, I got the delux burger since it was their popular item with an order of sweet potato fries. I ordered the burger medium well and it came out way over cooked. It was extremely bland, I had to add a lot of salt and pepper just to finish half of the burger. Oh, the BACON was nowhere to be found in my burger. Over $10 for this dinky tasteless burger? I rather go to in-n-out. The fries was okay since the sauce was good. My friend got the chicken panini sandwich, which she said was nothing special. With that price, you could've gotten much better for less elsewhere.   Overall, we're never coming back.

Came in on a Sunday evening, place was quiet and very clean. I love their decorations and design of the restaurant. Cozy place to sit and enjoy the food.  My friend and I ordered the drunken noodles (since everyone bragged about it), tom yum hot pot, and a beef salad. I wasn't very impressed by the drunken noodles since its too sweet on top and when I dig into the bottom it was a little too salty. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it but probably won't order it again. The Tom yum soup was flavorful, maybe cause I like my food spicy and sour. The soup could use a bit more meat in it. As for the beef salad, it was fresh but the meat could use a bit more flavor. Ordered two side of rice to eat with our soup and I was surprised that they charge $1.50 for a scoop of rice each. Maybe .75-$1 would be a decent price for it but $1.50? I'm not stingy when it comes to food, but for that price they should at least gave me a full bowl, not a small ice cream scoop of it. Overall, the bill came out to about $32 for all the food and rice, not bad.   Service was decent since it was not busy. The waitresses sat in the middle of the restaurant talking in their native language and only look up when you call for them. Overall, my waitress was attentive enough and friendly, and you won't have to ask for water refills because they bring out a pitcher along with the cups right when you are seated.   I'd go there again whenever I'm in the neighborhood.

The employees here, well the ones I've encountered with, are friendly and helpful. They have pretty good deals too. Check out their ads! :)

Good clean location. Food was freshly cooked when I went for lunch. Friendly staff, no complaints. I'll be going back to this one. :)

Eh we've had better. Way better. Place looked liked a prepubescent teenagers bedroom - messy and dirty. Drinks barely had any ice. Over priced for what it was. Won't be back.

This location has pretty much gone down hill through the years in terms of service. The baristas seem like they don't want to be there and who ever is stationed at the register in the morning acts like its a burden that you're ordering coffee so early. Weird.

Roasted duck was way too salty. Papaya salad was way too sweet. Tom Yum seafood soup was just okay. I loved the white rice! Lol -_____-    The restaurant was clean and nice though. Service was kind of slow, but then again there was only one waitress. My friend knew more about Thai food than the server! Hahah   "Best Thai Food in the West Valley" Yeah right! Is it because it is the only one available? Lol. I rather drive 5 more hours West to California to get some good Thai food. I'm done with these mediocre to nasty Asian restaurants in the West side..

We always come here to get our pool water tested. It's free too for those who don't know. The guys here are very knowledgable and friendly. They don't try to sell you stuff that you wouldn't need unlike from other places I've been too.

Free wifi. It was pretty clean, even the restroom. They use the card system here. It was $1.99 for the double load washers and $0.30 for the dryers. I wish the dryers were free like some other places though. Come early when it's empty!

Tried to call in an order several times on different days but they never answer their phone. What's up with that?  I love Thai food, I'll have to come in one day to try theirs. My review should change then.

Fast service. Free medium drink if you check in on FourSquare. Also good deals on their texting thingie. The manager was really nice and helpful. I'm glad they stopped using those horrible paper cups that made my blasts and shakes melt before I even drove off the lot! :)

Food, atmosphere, and drinks are great. Can't go wrong with $5 burgers every Monday. Ask for Mario, he's such an awesome server. Very attentive and friendly! You won't regret it!
