Let me start out by saying, I love sushi. I am willing to pay reasonable prices for good sushi. And I understand, and even accept the fact that we are landlocked and will never get super fresh fish. But that being said, there are some pretty good sushi places in the valley. Zen 32 isn't one of them.   The service was good, and the waitress helpful. She tried to coach some of the "sushi virgins" in our group about the menu. She was quite good at telling us what the items were, but it was obvious that she was simply repeating what she was told. She didn't really have the answers to a whole lot of questions. But she tried, and I'll give her an A for effort.   The fish, well pretty much universally the fish lacked any flavor. The rolls were quite expensive, and all the fried asparagus and other strong ingredients covered up the fish flavor. It seemed as if they knew that the fish had no flavor so they intentionally tried to cover it up. Everything was either rolled with asparagus, fried, or covered in spicy mayo or chili sauce. Any of the roe that was used as garnish was so dry it would roll around the plate. The appetizers were good, but way over priced. Ten dollars for 5 lettuce leaves and a half a cup of filling is a bit much.   Total bill per person for half an appetizer, iced tea, and a roll and a half each? Roughly forty dollars. If you like sushi, go somewhere else, enjoy it more, and save money.

Always had good experiences. Answered questions when I had them, and are fast with product pickups when I ordered online. Can't think of a better retail experience. Third party accessory prices are a bit high though.

After camera shopping all day we decided to stop in on our way home. The first thing I noticed was that even though the shop was small, they seemed to have a decent selection of hard to find supplies. And they still develop film :-). We were looking for a new camera for my wife's new business (jewelry design), and for general fun. We shopped at every big box store in the valley. And no one was particularly helpful.   When we stopped in and explained what it was we needed, they were quick to offer a few suggestions. After narrowing it down to two possible options we decided on a Nikon P100. My wife was very hesitant to spend such a large sum of money. However the people we talked to did a very good job of easing her anxiety and guided us in the right direction.   The service and help was excellent. The prices were good, and the support after the sale is fantastic. All their cameras come with a free hour lesson, and a manufactures extended warranty. They handle, and file all the paperwork. They also offer classes, that I believe are free.   Overall I am very impressed with this service. And on my next purchase (hopefully a nice DSLR for fun) I will be going back. It's worth paying slightly more than a Sam's Club of Best Buy for the quality of service you receive. And when you factor in the extended warranty you actually come out a little ahead.

I used to love this place when they first opened. But I have to say, that lately it seems as if they staff the store with exployees who just left Best Buy, they may seem like they know firearms to the inexperienced shooter, but for the most part they make it up as they go. Every time I go in there I have to fight someone to give them my money. I walked to 3 different registers with product in hand, but the people behind the counter were too busy having converstions to pay attention to me. I finally dropped my stuff on the counter and left. Only then did they pay attention. No worries, I went to US Autoweapons next door and dropped a couple hundred dollars. I let my membership lapse, the range is nice, but the staff are pretty hard to deal with.  Every time I would go in there, they would get my membership mixed up with my familys. It only took 2 years to get that straightened up. And their gunsmiths, forget it. And forget about ordering a gun and having it shipped there. The one time I did that, it had come from a dealer in another state and arrived in 24 hours. But they sat on it in the warehouse for 4 days before I could pick it up. Ordering a part for a gun was another 2 month ordeal. And a warranty return on a line of holsters they would carry took 2 weeks and 2 different managers.   I used to spend a ton of money on shooting and the related accessories, and every time I try to like SGC. But it seems that their customer service gets worse with every single visit. They have the attitude that they have become so large, they don't need customers. I find that very frustrating, and a bad business move. Even more so when theres a shop 40 feet from their door that carries the same stuff, and is much more friendly.   The only plus side is they are sometimes the only local store to carry certain items. But I find myself ordering more and more stuff on of the internet.

Screw these guys. They decide to expand their store and in the process kill a small business. The Mail Vault was closed with 2 days notice to accommodate their expansion. I am all for saving money on food, but I will never spend a dime there after they had shown their true colors. I don't care if its the leasing companies fault, they managed to kill a the type of small business that supports the American economy. If I could post a huge middle finger to this company I would!

Let me start by saying the previous owner of this place was a waste of space. I had some important license information held for 5 days before mailing and then returned to sender because it was weighed incorrectly.   Michael really improved upon the place and did a great job. But unfortunately it was closed recently. Apparently from what we heard at the post office the Safeway decided to expand and gave Mike 24 hours to vacate, they then changed the locks. So I plan on finding a new P.O. box and never shopping at Safeway ever again. Either the  Safeway or the Landlord are breaching a contract here, and I really don't care who did it. It's shady and neither of them deserve my business. F$&@ their faces!

This is the most unorganized group of people I have ever had the displeasure of giving my money to. If you need financial aid forget this school. Even the admissions dept literally said "They turn over all the time and don't know anything." Every term I have taken there has been an utter and complete disaster. And because of their lack of organization I was dropped from classes after the drop/add date and as a consequence received three F's. Now my GPA is boned and they aren't willing to help me remedy the situation. And these are classes I re-enrolled in and passed (after they got their shit together).   DO NOT take classes here. DO NOT trust anyone you speak to on the phone. DO NOT think they have the students interests in mind. As long as you pay tuition, they don't give a rats ass about what happens to the student after that.

The food is great, but turn down the music so you don't jack up my order. I was only asked to repeat it four times and it still got screwed up. Not like wrong toppings kinda error, but totally different sandwich. I like the new location, but the service seems to have gotten worse.

I went there last night with the wife after finding out her favorite BBQ place closed. I have to say I was very impressed. The portions were huge, the prices very reasonable. And more importantly the food was great. I was very impressed. Even my wife who is the pickiest eater I have EVER met loved the place. They claim to have the best ribs in AZ, and I believe it. We will be going back there for sure.

Great food, great service. The only downside is the place is a little warm inside. They claim the best ribs in AZ, and I believe it. Very good place.

We went there again a few weeks ago. I just wanted to write and say that the first review I did still stands, this place hasn't declined. Two good experiences. I am satisfied!

We tried this place for the first time last night. I have to say this place is quite impressive. After being ruined by "Chili's" or "Applebees" burgers I have lost faith in the valley's mainstream burger providers.   This place was very different. To start out they bring you a starter plate of "home"made chips. Very nice touch. Not the same old gimmick. The first thing you'll notice is the sushi bar style menu. Pick what you want and fill in the bubble. Very interesting concept.   My wife, the ever simple eater ordered the grilled cheese sandwich and fries. This is the first ever grilled cheese sandwich I have seen that actually had flavor and wasn't soaked in grease. The fries were crispy and done right. Not limp, actually cooked through, and crispy. Almost like they were fried twice (like fries are supposed to be).   I ordered the fried dill pickle chips. While they weren't earth shattering, they were good. Served with the standard ranch dressing. For my meal, I went all the way and ordered the "Vesuvius". It is a burger with cheese in the middle. It had a little warning next to it. Heed the warning. My first bite into the sandwich was absolutely painful. Molten cheese came shooting out, and I felt like an idiot. After giving it a little cooling time, the burger was easily the best burger I have had in a long time.   Overall this is a good place to eat. I was very impressed. I will have to go back and try the other options on their menu.... Like the Kobe burger....

Small retail location, but this the place that gun shops were meant to be. Once I walked in there just for grins, and noticed a used gun they had on display. A couple days later I went to go pick it up and called before I had left. Not only did the person on the phone tell me if it was still in stock, but he examined it for me on the phone answering specific questions (trying to figure out if the Beretta 92 was new model or old model). Great service. My wife and I went in there and stayed for an hour or so just talking. Overall great experience.

Having them receive a gun, and help me ship a gun out. The same level of service I expect from my past visits, and Kate even gave some advice to help me avoid getting ripped off by a buyer (doing an out of state sale). I love how they talk to their customers like they are people, and don't have the typical gun store arrogance that many shops around the valley can have. I also noticed that during the rush of panic buying their prices have stayed more or less consistent. No gouging there, one of the best places in the valley for no BS sales, and a general good time.

My wife and I went here a few days ago, and ate at Cielo. We had the Prosciutto and Grilled Water Melon appetizer. It was nothing short of amazing. The meat was great, the salty, sweet, and chili oil were perfect together. The chef that designed the dish came out and delivered it. My wife had one of the salads, the name escapes me. But it was very good. She had the roasted chicken with sweet garlic sauce, and I had the Fillet that was their featured meal. The desserts were great too. Chocolate cake with a warm center, and a ricotta cheese cake. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. It was much better than the Asian/Cuban fusion fiasco that was there previously.   The food was a bit pricey, but worth it. Even at their price point, you still got more, and better food than most "high end" restaurants in that class.   Do yourself a favor and try this place. You will keep coming back. It is much better than Asia De Cuba

Well as it turns out, the owners shut the place down, and in the process f-ed over a bunch of their employees. I know a few that worked there. Managment didnt even stay in the meeting for 3 minutes after they told everyone they would be unemployed. I don't think I could ever give this company my money ever again, no matter what iron chef they bring into the restaurant.

Full disclosure: I have friends in the vaping industry. I do not work for vape shops in any way, shape, or form. I have shopped at and spent money in most every brick and mortar store in the valley. And no shop has ever given me anything for free, or traded goods in exchange for a review. As a matter of fact I rarely ever leave negative Yelp reviews. There are shops I like more than others, but I primarily care about the industry as a whole and not one particular shops success over another. The way I look at it, is that if my word and opinions alone make or break a vape shop, then they have failed to retain customers. Simply put, yes they are my friends, but I am spending my own money, and I will spend it where I believe I will receive the best value.   Today I took a friend to Vapor Vortex off of Shea Blvd today to try out some liquids. I have been there a few times before, and my brother has frequented the shop as well. I have usually had good experiences there. Their prices on parts is pretty competitive, and their selection of high end devices is larger than any other shop I have seen. Overall I like their employees too. I will say however that from a fairly objective standpoint, their liquid line-up is not my favorite or the most consistent I have had. I have never been a fan of the Chinese import stuff, but it does fill a market niche. The J-Vapes has most certainly had a decline in quality and flavor concentration over the last few years though. That's truly sad, as they had some winning flavors.  They do carry Murdock's Pluid and other flavors, which aren't my cup of tea, but are high quality liquids and have a strong following. For those of you out there that like the complex and more multifaceted flavors, you will love the Murdock line.   I do have to say that any love I had for Vapor Vortex died today. We went in there so my friend could try flavors, and I wanted to browse. We had a petite blond woman "help" us. My friend was tasting flavors, and he is a picky guy. He rejected a few and the woman asked what he had been vaping on. He mentioned the name of the other retailer and immediately she went off on a tangent about how they run a dirty and underhanded business. She said "they sold me 36mg liquid when I was a new vaper and didn't tell me". When I asked how the hell that happened she stammered around and moved to another topic she could use to discredit the business. "They have their employees post negative Yelp reviews for other shops", and on, and on, and on. She was almost spastic in her eagerness to talk trash about the other shop. She even mentioned that Vapor Vortex and another shop she didn't name have taken an interest in making sure people knew about it.   Here's my problem with that. I don't give a flying rats ass. Again, the worst way to convince me to spend money in your shop is to play the victim card. She then complained how the vaping industry is similar to "a bunch of high school girls". Well excuse me, but I believe she was the one that initiated the spewfest of shop smack-talk. She kept repeating "We're number one for sales in the state, they're number three". Again, I just don't really care. Vapor Vortex's annual income is of no concern to me. Furthermore she did not know that a liquid I wanted to buy was actually in stock until she was corrected by another emplyoee. I asked to look at an atomizer in the case, and it took her three attempt to find it, even with explicit instructions. Then she removes the wrong item from the case (not even an atomizer) places it on the counter and walks away. And it wasn't because they were busy. We were two of three customers in the store, and there were two employees.   The crowning jewel however is this gem. She asks if my friend and I are brothers. I say no, and that's no big deal, we get that all the time. About 15 minutes later she asks "Are you two together?" And I am immediately thinking she is asking if we want one transaction or two. Before I can answer my friend raises his hand, shows his wedding ring and tells her that we are both married, to women. I think this is a light hearted joke on his part. But her answer indicated that she was actually asking if we were a gay couple. My freaking head spun. I am not gay, he isn't gay, and frankly I don't mind if I am mistaken for gay. I don't have a gay phobia by any stretch of the imagination. However, some people do, and that question would piss a lot of people off more than it did me. And even if we were gay, what damn business is it of hers? What if we said yes? What possible positive end to that conversation could there be?   I am sorry, I used to go to this shop because they carried things other brick and mortars didn't. Not only was the customer service poor, but her behavior was inappropriate and grossly unprofessional. Sorry. I am done.  Oh, and in case you suspect I am an employee of "the other guys" I will gladly show my receipt and Vapor Vortex loyalty card I no longer carry.

Chris  I appreciate your response and the fact that you are trying to support your employee. However, I take issue with some of your comments. I understand there can be misunderstandings in some retail situations, but there was no misinterpretation when it came to statements made about other stores. Perhaps my friend and I misunderstand her asking if we were together, but frankly, that was the least egregious part of this encounter. An insult about another business in the industry is very straight forward and difficult to misinterpret. This was not a slip of the tongue on her part. She insulted the other shop more than she answered questions about products. She even mentioned that Vapor Vortex and another shop have been "victims" and are "making sure people know about how they do their business". There's very little room for interpretation in statements such as those. So, coaching or not, this policy seems to have been ignored or forgotten in this circumstance. She only gave up on that line of conversation when I asked her who the other shop was. I wanted to know so I could avoid doing business with them as well. This question was never answered and instead prompted her to stop talking about the issue entirely. My interpretation of this whole encounter was that it was significantly more important to her that I know how much she hated this store than it was to answer the questions I had about a product I was looking at purchasing. And when she finally did get back around to helping me with a product, she actually walked away after handing me the wrong product.  I can also appreciate that her side of the story was different than mine. However,  I am not writing  this review to gain anything, and she has a job she is trying to keep. So I will ask you point blank, do you believe I am lying? Or perhaps more importantly, who has a reason to lie?  Just a note to add, I've been to other vape shops, including the one that your employee deemed vicious and evil, and I've seen them refer customers to your store if it was appropriate. All I expect is that you extend the same courtesy to the other stores in this industry.
