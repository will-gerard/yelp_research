I really hate writing this review.  I have grown up in this neighborhood and have been eating at uncle sam's my whole life.  I have always enjoyed eating and having good times at uncle Sam's.  This last time I was there was a total disappointment.       To start the waitress could not get are drinks right and took three times to get the order right.  Then when I asked her to bring  table water, she went on to insist that the others did not need water.  Usually I would not make a big deal of this but when everyone at the table is drinking beer I think it is responsibility of the waitress to bring the water to the table regardless.        She then proceed to call the manager over to confront me of asking her to bring the water over.  I almost felt as I was getting imitated  but for the fact that he was not responsive with his own questions.          Never the-less if  are looking for poor service and a lack of management; uncle sam's on 32'nd and Shea is the place to go.

If you are looking for a New Mexican cuisine look no more! This place is amazing! Had brunch this Sunday and paul, Chris, and Elena  delivered top notch service! The pork verde with eggs was great and if you like jalape√±o bacon you will not be let down. If you don't know now you do, they have the best margaritas in town!

So talk about gooood! I'm a pizza connoisseur and so is my girlfriend! This place is fantastic! It reminds me of a small place in Italy called Mario's pizza! Brick oven pizza to perfection! Great service, excellent food, awesome ambiance!! This place is a hidden treasure.. Ask for Ale (pronounced Aly)she is the best!!

This place is amazing! Reminds me of the north region of Italy! With true Italians working and making great pizza and pasta you truly are in for a great experience. Ciao.
