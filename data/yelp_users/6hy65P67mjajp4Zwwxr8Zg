I purchased a Living Social deal for $300 for a year of Botox. I called to make an appointment and left a voicemail which was never returned so then I booked my appointment online, got a confirmation email, drove 30 miles to have the office be locked. The voicemail was full and 10 minutes after my appointment time a man called saying the doctor was sick and he was sure she would call to reschedule. She did not. I booked another appointment for the following Saturday, received an email confirmation, drove another 30 miles to have the office be locked again! I cannot leave a message as the vm is full. Is this even a legit business and how do I get my $300 back?! Il pay full price for Botox to save the frustration of this shady practice.

This is one of the nicest nail salons I've been to in the East Valley. Not only do all of the employees do amazing work, but they always go above and beyond to make sure the environment is beautifully decorated, clean, and inviting. This place is absolutely my new favorite go to place!!

Christa and Tenpoint5 are seriously two of the best things to come into my life! I tried another popular barre studio and felt judged as soon as I walked in because I wasn't decked out in Lulu Lemon with a perfect body. Christa is always upbeat and cheerful and she always makes sure that I'm doing everything correctly so I can get the most out of every workout. Both the Chandler studio and the Tempe studio with Sarah are outstanding! If you love barre or have ever wondered what it's all about, definitely go to either location to see why Tenpoint5 is the BEST!!!
