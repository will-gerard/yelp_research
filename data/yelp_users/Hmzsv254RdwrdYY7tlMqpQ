This is my favorite car service shop on the entire planet! Every time I've ever brought in a vehicle I feel I've been treated fairly and squarely by first-rate professionals, who bend over backwards to take care of you; giving you the straight scoop on your vehicle; and they don't try to sell you anything that isn't truly ready to be replaced. Let's face it, taking a vehicle in for service isn't typically anyone's idea of a barrel of fun.    And, who hasn't at some point in their lives had a vehicle in for something simple, such as an oil change, only to get handed an estimate of $1,759 (or a lot more) for supposed repairs your vehicle may not truly need? Not to mention that if you object to any of the estimate, particularly the most farfetched part of it, you may be told something to the effect that your vehicle "could blow up," or "the wheels will fall off, " or "you could be left stranded on the freeway," etc. If you're like me, you've been told this sort of thing many, many times.   That doesn't ever happen at Kelly Clark, as they don't suggest replacing something unless you actually need the repair. In my mind, their integrity is as immaculate as the squeaky-clean waiting room. Customers just want honesty, and you'll get it at Kelly Clark. And they also do a better job of explaining exactly what is going on with your car than any place I have ever had a vehicle in for service.   One if my favorite experiences here was when I brought a car brought a car in here, extemporaneously, that I was thinking of buying and asked them to do a complete inspection of the vehicle (as the owner had no documented maintenance records); and I was a little leery of taking a stranger's word for how well the car had been maintained.  Naturally, the owner of the vehicle was not too thrilled we were there (since the car was pristine in his mind), but he agreed to have the inspection as a condition of selling the car.  Fortunately, as I anticipated, Kelly Clark immediately jumped to attention and whipped the car in and out in a very timely fashion, replete with an assessment (either "pass" or "fail" for everything they checked).  And the final price ($57) was not only extremely reasonable, but it was also below the quote!    I ended buying the car, with peace of mind, thanks to Kelly Clark and their excellent service.  UPDATE: 18 months - and 29k miles later - this car has not had a single repair, other than regular maintenance which was recommended by Kelly Clark at the time of the inspection (and corroborated by other facilities that subsequently arrived at the same conclusion): flushing the transmission fluid, brake pads, and flushing the power steering fluid. Kelly Clark was spot on!  UPDATE 2: 26 months - and 48k miles later - this car has only had one repair: a stuck lug nut. Meaning, that Kelly Clark's recommendation to buy the car turned out to be right on the money! Thank you, Kelly Clark, you're the best!

I brought my car in here for a transmission issue, and I had them do a couple of test drives with the car on separate occasions. The final verdict from their team of crackerjack experts: I needed a new transmission for $2300.   This I found very hard to believe, since the transmission only had about 15,000 (of mostly highway) miles on it. So I took the car somewhere else, and a quick and simple test revealed that all I needed was a new sensor. Problem solved, and the car is still running with the same transmission 159,000 miles later.    Needless to say, I have not been back to this location since.  I know people can make diagnostic mistakes, but this was a rather glaring one, and involved multiple people.

I was generally very satisfied with my experience at Discount Tire in Ahwatukee. Though, truth be told, I wasn't planning on getting tires here. After researching tires and prices for a few days, until I was bleary-eyed, I actually had chosen the nearby Sam's Club (online) for my tires. However, one of my worn tires was losing so much air that I was filling it up every day, and after a few days of that, it was getting very old, very fast. So I now I needed new tires, and I suddenly wanted them much sooner rather than later. But to get the tires I had just picked out, Sam's Club requires that you order the tires, and then have them shipped to the store 3-5 business days later. But I needed tires NOW! I didn't really want to spend the next week putting air in one of my old tires.   So, as fate would have it, I ended up requesting a price match with Discount Tire through their website. And less than an hour later I received a phone call from one of the salespeople at the Ahwatukee location beating both the price of Sam's Club on 4 tires, as well as the installation (mounting/balancing) price of Sam's Club. And they can install the tires today, RIGHT NOW, not next week! Pretty impressive. So I verbally agreed to a price, "out the door."    Though once I got there, the salesperson stated the price quote over the phone did not include sales tax (an additional $41), which makes a little bit of a difference on the final, "out the door" price, if you ask me. I'd be very careful about quoting people exact prices, and leaving out the ($41) sales tax from the "out the door" quote, as that could be construed as being deceptive.  Nevertheless, I was still saving $60 with the price match, and the tires would be on my car shortly, so I wasn't complaining. But I could imagine others not being too happy with the sales tax not being mentioned in the price tag "out the door."   Now I do like the fact that Discount Tires offers a free rotation/inspection at 6k-8k miles, but I was a little surprised that there was absolutely no mention on what to expect from tires until they're properly "broken in." (It doesn't cost anything to tell customers who just handed you enough cash to finance a small army how to best drive your car immediately after buying new tires - as in you're not going to be able to take corners or stop as you otherwise would with broken-in tires.)  I'd expect that lack of communication from Wal-Mart, but this place, on the other hand, is a national chain tire store!   Anyway, I was told it would take 40 minutes, so I whipped out my laptap, only to discover there's no Wi-Fi, and that meant that I actually had to work while I was there; rather than mindlessly cruise the Yelp website (which I wanted to take a picture of me doing) while I was at Discount Tire!   Though, my working experience there was very short-lived because my car was done in less than 20 minutes, with some pretty nice tires at a great price, and in a very timely fashion. Thank you, Discount Tire!

If you love looooooooooooooong lines and snail-like customer service at the DMV, APS, or the Post Office then you'll absolutely adore Cox Solutions Store!  I, on the other hand, am not enamored with a labyrinth of rules and regulations, so I couldn't help but think of all sorts of reasons why bureaucracies, red tape, economic straightjackets are a psychological nightmare as I sat there, waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting... just to turn in a temporary Internet modem.     Though, it didn't start out so badly. When I first walked through the front door, there was a pleasant-enough woman standing there to greet me. I (foolish me) thought to myself, "This will only take minute!"    HaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHa... well the joke was on me!  Yes, the woman said someone else would have to help me, and that I'd have to take a seat until they called my name "Steve #2" (Steve #1, apparently, was one of the many unlucky fellow waiters ahead of me in the pecking order.)   And so I sat, and sat, and sat, and sat. And I couldn't help but think (more than a few times) "Why couldn't that woman who greeted me just take my modem? After all, she had a computer at her fingertips, and it would have only taken a minute!" Ah, my friends, but that would be efficient. And Cox is not efficient. Instead, like their cousins, the DMV, APS, and the Post Office, they make you wait. An eternity.   And yet they had five employees on the premises, but two of them appeared only to be greeters, who do nothing but take names. Now why couldn't we (i.e., the customers) just take a number like they do at the other red-tape establishments, thereby freeing up two valuable employees to help the masses waiting????  Ohhhhhhhhhhh, but that would be more efficient. And Cox is about as efficient as west-bound traffic on I-10 headed out of downtown at 5pm on a weeknight.    Finally, my moment in the Sun arrived and my name was called.  I walked up to the front desk, and handed in my modem. And less than one minute later I was walking out the door; hopeful that I don't have to come back here any time soon.

After my initial 1-star review for BluePearl I did have the luxury of discussing the situation with staff members, including the head-honcho vet, the toplofty and vainglorious Dr.Herrera, regarding the treatment of our late, great dog, Jake. Originally, I had written that BluePearl was either blind to the obvious (that our dog was dying) or that they were just money-grubbers and were taking advantage of it, or both. I'll tell you, it certainly seems like both because these people act way short on showing any intuition regarding the condition of your pet, and are overreliant on pricey testing for the "answers." Or maybe that's just the crooked game they play?   This all started when our beloved little loverboy dog, Jake (who wanted to meet every single person he ever encountered, and make friends with any animal he could, and he melted a lot of people's hearts because of it) suddenly began throwing up and had diarrhea of blood that just wouldn't stop. Now one would think that the workers at BluePearl would have seen something such as this before, or would know something about these types of symptoms. But no, it appeared as though this was the first time they had ever encountered such a scenario, ever. And the only solution to find out what was going on with our dog was, of course, "aggressive action." So "aggressive," in fact, it meant showing us an invoice for just shy of $2,000 in "tests" and overnight "hospitalization."   My gut told me that this whole scheme stunk to high heaven, by employing either an apparent overreliance on break-the-bank tests and an absolute underreliance on any semblance of horse sense on the part of the staff; OR, that they're such money-grubbers that they see nothing but dollars signs on people's foreheads, regardless of whether your pet is on death's door or not. Either way it's not good.One can't help but wonder what did vets did before all these highfalutin tests? Guess what? They had to use their experience and intuition!   Now the dog's mom was hesitant to spend that kind of money "on a dog that could be dead in the morning." Well, she was right. He was dead the next morning. And we were out the money, less the whopping $350 they refunded us because the dog wasn't even there long enough to rack up the full charges!   But they don't have to be de facto money-grubbers if they can't think on their feet. If all they're going to do is to rely solely on testing in perpetuity, and throw darts at a board when it comes to what exactly is wrong with your pet, then the money will roll in as though they just won the lottery! With your money. In our case, we actually received a message a couple of hours after we first dropped off our dog stating that his "bloodwork was fine." But the next morning we were hearing the exact opposite! That our dog was suddenly "full of infection" and that he would need extensive, long-term hospitalization.     What was wrong with our dog? Well, they didn't know. In fact, they weren't any closer to figuring that out than they were $2k earlier. And we were facing the prospect of upwards of another $20k(?) in tests, drugs, and hospitalization? The bottom line is that all things look alike in the dark. And these people act blind and operating without a map; with an apparent modus operandi of feeling their way through the darkness and run a battery of tests than to ever admit something such as, "This dog ain't gonna make it."   Not to mention that this place really plays upon your emotions like a maestro with a symphony. They know all the chords to strike. Your pet is on death's doorstep and they take full advantage of it to persuade you that more, more, more can be done. Ultimately, we went to people who were all acting as if they were blindfolded and playing pin the tail on the donkey. And we were out upwards of $2k with nothing to show for it but a dead pet the next morning that suffered while the cash register is ringing cha-ching, cha-ching for BluePearl the entire time our dying dog was in agony.    Regardless, I did talk to the haughty, brassy, and aristocratic head honcho vet, Dr. Herrera, after the fact, and he went over all the charts. From his lofty ivory tower, he confidently declared that our dog "was not dying" when we put him down. He wasn't? Then why did we put him down? I'll tell you why: We put him down because he was dying! We didn't need their endless fishing expedition of tests to see with our own eyes and smell with our own noses that our dog had three paws in the grave and the other on a banana peel.   But if he wasn't dying why did they tell us, after we made our final decision, that we were suddenly "doing the right thing"?! Because they knew! But if they can play on your emotions and give you hope, while chiseling another $20k out of you, why not?  My advice: steer clear of this place. They will bleed you dry if they can get away with it. At best, there's major competency issues; at worst, they cheat until caught and then lie about it.

Is this not the absolutely WORST "company" in the entire United States of America? There's nothing like a near-monopoly to ensure atrocious customer service and horrendous "business" practices. In fact, without their near-monopoly status I doubt this company could stay in business one week without all their political pull to stay operational and protect them from any real competition. In the real world, this "company" would fall apart faster than a sandcastle on the beach with the high tide coming in. Dealing with them is like a plane crashing right after takeoff!    The straw that broke the camel's back with us was an issue over our Internet speed. After getting yet another unannounced price hike of $5 for basic Internet (knocking us up to $53/mo. for the basic plan), we started receiving junk mail from Cox to increase our speed. As if $53/mo. wasn't enough for slow Internet, they wanted to bite a hand that feeds them with their fangs for more money. So we called to complain that CenturyLink was offering significantly faster Internet for nearly half of what we were paying, and our Internet (even with new, blazing-fast computers) was slower than a snail in molasses. But rather than lower our rate to be more competitive, they offered us turbo-charged Internet for just $3/mo. extra. Finally, we imagined, we would have lightening-quick, supersonic, K-jetronic Internet!   Though, we ought to have known better. As our Internet was even SLOWER with the higher rate: as fast a turtle stuck in the mud. This is what you get for $56 a month and all Cox's (make that "Crock's) phony promises?  Money brings out the worst in those with the least character, and we had enough abuse from the Cox Pied Piper; as this ultimately forced us to switch to CenturyLink - out of sheer disgust over the unparalleled, second-to-none ineptitude of Cox.  But the final ongoing debacle with this "company" is that we found it exceedingly difficult just to cancel our Cox Internet "service"; despite the fact that we moved; we had previously called them about cancelling on numerous occasions regarding the move and how/why they weren't seemingly prorating our account because we were moving. Yet we were repeatedly assured this was not the case. Wrong! Cox still billed us at the old address as though we still lived there (and insisted that we owed them money for current charges at a place we no longer resided) and vehemently denied we had ever called them about either issue (because they didn't document WHY we had called them). That's our fault!? And they wanted to fight us on this one? Over a few dollars? Is it our fault that the "company" is a disgrace to that word?   Honestly, dealing with Cox is just one disaster after another after another after another that I think we'd be more likely to give up Internet altogether than to EVER use this horrific-excuse for a "business" again. Every time you deal with them is like getting a bloody nose, and you feel you've gotten caught in the undertow of a tidal wave. This entire company is one big house of cards, that would blow apart into a zillion pieces with the slightest gust of wind if they had to operate in a free market without their enormous political pull to operate as a virtual monopoly.    What do you get for all the hard-earned money you give them? One big, painful headache. As well as the displeasure of dealing with the Masters of Disaster. Two thumbs down, way, way, way, way, way down for an absolutely pathetic excuse for a "business."

Seriously. What's not to like about this airport? Have you been to the other one in town? Oh sure, if you love half-mile long lines to get through security, or the complexity and chaotic energy of an ant hill - as intricate as the inside of a watch - or parking as far away as a bird can fly in a lifetime, etc. then you might want to stay away from Mesa Gateway Airport.   Granted, this gem of an airport is a little bit off the beaten path to get here, but if you live in the southeast Valley, this place is tough to beat. And, yes, the airlines that fly out of here are imperfect, but my review is not about them and their $55 one-way tickets to other airports around the Lower 48 (States) that are cut from the same cloth. (I do admit that I don't travel with virtually everything I own, stuffed into bulging-at-the-seams, oversized rolling foot lockers [aka "suit cases"], for that weekend trip to Shangri La; nor do I need to know what seat I'll be in more than 24 hours in advance; so I don't get stuck with those additional fees. But let's get back to the airport, which is what this review is supposed to be about in the first place!)    And I'll grant you that this terminal has (as far as I can tell) just two places to eat; even though there's a sign outside that says it all about the simplicity of this terminal: "Restaurant"; unlike that other airport that has more restaurants than grains of sand at Huntington Beach. So no, this airport does not have the fancy amenities of the other one, but that's not why many of us travel.  And I'll grant you that you have to go outside to get on/off the plane, but at least there's a shading system (see pics) that lowers the temp outside by 1 3/4 degrees. But hey, for $55 one way, I can slum it with the best of 'em! And besides, this is actually how people back in the "olden days" traveled by plane, so I consider it a history lesson.   And obviously, the big drawback to this airport is the convenience factor, now that Spirit airlines is bailing out to Sky Harbor. For example, if you need to get to Chicago, I believe the closest you can get is Rockford, IL. Need to get to Des Moines? Try Cedar Rapids for a change.  Minneapolis? Well, you'll love the autumn leaves in Rochester, MN this time of year; and while you're there, check out the Mayo Clinic! So, as far as I know, this airport will not help you get to many of the big-city destinations, but if, e.g., Missoula, Montana is a familiar stomping grounds for you, then you'll love this airport, and it even comes with trees!   Some of the things that endear me to this airport, besides the trees, worthy of the illustrious 5-star review, is that this place is so clean that even Mr. Clean himself would be proud; this airport is as calm as a placid lake and as whisper-quiet as a butterfly's flapping wings; getting in and out of here with you car is as easy as climbing a fallen tree; and even the economy parking lot ($6 a day) is close by, and it doesn't require a shuttle ride, followed by multiple flights up escalators, followed by a tram ride just to get within a country mile of your car.   Yes, I'll take this airport over the other one any day.

It has been over a year since my previous review, and given that I've flown out of this airport quite a few times in the past year, I have just a few additional comments to make.   First, I have noticed that the airlines flying out of there can schedule quite a few flights within an hour of one another. I can only assume that the purpose of this is to reduce the cost of TSA screeners? So if you're prone to arriving at airports late, especially around 3pm on a Friday, you might be standing in a line that stretches out the door (as another reviewer mentioned) just to get through security. On at least two occasions, I noticed 5 flights scheduled out of this airport within one hour's time; meaning, a lot of travelers converging on this tiny little airport in a small window of time. So be prepared in the event your flight out of this airport is at a busy flying time and plan accordingly.   Secondly, I recently had a flight delayed, which didn't put me in until around 12 a.m. In this case, my car had been parked at the economy lot for quite some time (as in weeks not days), racking up a hefty charge for parking. But when I went to pay, the payment machine (which is the only way to pay because there are no human beings manning the lot) would not read my credit card (the only one I had with me - which was working immediately before and has worked perfectly fine ever since), and the payment machine does not take debit cards! So that left me, in my mind, with only two options to get out of the parking lot that night: pay cash in the EXACT amount, OR sleep in my car and try to sort it all out in the morning. Fortunately, for me, I had the cash on me. But I doubt many others would have that much on them, and in the exact amount. So beware of this potential issue if you park long-term in the economy lot. Otherwise, my original review stands as written.

I swear I've been going to this place since before recorded history, back when dinosaurs roamed the planet. Ahhhhhhhhhh, the memories... You'll be glad to know that the old, falling-apart-at-the-seams-saddle-worn seats with gum on them have been replaced with slick highbacks; the garbled, scratchy sound system has been eighty-sixed for a high-end digital one; and even the screens themselves have a sharper, digitized image. Add less-expensive-than-usual snacks to the mix, as well as cheesy memorabilia in the lobby, and you've got the makings of a classy movie experience!   What's not to like about this place? Well, keep in mind that this venue opened before the dawn of time, so don't go expecting stadium-style sightlines that all the new places have these days. Also, think Wal-Mart when it comes to the clientele. North Scottsdale it ain't! Which means the customers aren't always as quiet as a mouse during the film. (Though, keep in the mind that the type of film being shown on any given screen will obviously attract different types of crowds.)   But, otherwise, you can't beat the price, and the seats, sound, and picture quality are decent. So live it up with all the money you'll save visiting this theater; instead of going to those other places with their make-the-eyes-water ticket prices, as well as snack bar rates that make the menu at a fancy, 5-star restaurant seem like K-mart blue-light specials. Your savings will help finance the kids' Ivy League-college fund, or maybe help with that down payment on the mansion in Paradise Valley you've had your eye on. The choices are endless. Enjoy!

Having previously had moving experiences that would make a haunted house shutter in fear (such as movers running out of gas, holding our bed hostage until we paid a higher-than-agreed-upon rate, and showing up with newbie movers who treated work like the Black Plague), we were pretty hesitant to hire movers again. But after our last experience (where we rented a truck and did the entire job ourselves - and lived to tell the tale!), we took the plunge; turning to Yelp testimonials for guidance as to who to hire.   Well, I can tell you, when it was all said and done, that these people are first-rate. They arrived on time (not hours late), moved our prized possessions in what seemed like a flash of light (instead of like a snail in molasses), they didn't run out of gas, nor hold our bed hostage, nor show up with rookie movers that wouldn't lift a finger to help if their life depended on it. In fact, everything went as smooth as a mountain stream, and we would not hesitate to hire Camelback Moving again! Two thumbs up, waaaaaaay up, for a job well done.

I usually avoid the Post Office, for good reason. Take the latest trip, for example. I go into this location to send two small items out of state, and I didn't want to travel all the way over to FedEx just to send a thimbleful of goods. My mistake. It won't happen again.   Unfortunately, I didn't have a box or tape on me, so I used one of the Post Office's teeny-weeny little boxes and some of their tape  to package up my items. It turns out the box is $2.65. You'd think I was buying a box big enough to hold a refrigerator, not one closer to the size of a thimble.  And guess what? That tape I used, which the Post Office so generously provided, is "priority tape." That's right, "priority tape." They don't tell you that when you borrow the tape, and of course they don't have any other tape for customers, so now I can either ship the 1 oz. thimble-sized box for $9.68 or redo the whole thing just to save a few bucks. I ate it.  But I hope no one affiliated with the U.S. Post Office ever wonders why we don't want to do business with you. This is how you treat us?  But this is typical of any outfit that isn't really accountable to the customers.   Me, I hope to never set foot in the place again, but I doubt that will happen. Which is why they can get away with charging $9.68 to ship a 1 oz box the size of a thimble with fancy-schmancy "priority tape" on it.

Chef Sara's is my idea of the GOLD STANDARD OF QUALITY in The Valley of the Sun. It's that good; as good as gold. And I'm not saying that after a single trip, but after innumerable trips. (Also, I would never consider reviewing a restaurant after a single trip and imagine that my review ought to even hold the weight of a feather in terms of credibility.)  In fact, I'd go as far to say that Chef Sara's is a crowning achievement of culinary excellence in The Valley; using only the finest, freshest organic ingredients, and nothing that has been deranged (i.e. destroyed by cooking it into oblivion). Chef Sara then takes the finest raw materials Nature can provide and she creates truly unique, imaginative, and innovative meals (see pics) like nothing else in the entire Valley!     In fact, the food at Chef Sara's is so energizing, so nourishing, so delightful, that I eagerly make the 50-mile trip, each way, from Ahwatukee with my eyes full of wild anticipation all the way there; and then there's a bright, satisfied light coming from those from same eyes all the way back - as a warm glow envelopes every inch of my soul.    The food at Chef Sara's is the elixir of life, and she does it up right. Every bite, an explosion of joy, an exclamation point of taste, as lustrous as silk rolling across my tongue. Each flavor is a moment to savor. My favorite is the RAWgasmic sandwich, a genuine foodgasm if there ever was one; as each glorious morsel that parades over my taste buds feels as if the bands are playing, the flags are waving, and the fireworks are flying! Though, in my mind, everything at Chef Sara's is first-rate, as if you're eating off a silver platter and drinking from a golden chalice.   In fact, I'd say that Chef Sara's is actually everything the more popular and venerated (Un)True Food Kitchen only portends to be. That's because the food at Chef Sara's is actually REAL, authentic, unadulterated, TRUE food.  And while I'm thinking about it, I'd venture to say that "real," in anything, tastes better, looks better, feels better, and is more alluring, captivating, and appealing - to the all of the senses.  If you think about it, people are naturally more attracted to anything that is authentic; more attracted to the simple; more attracted to the healthy; more attracted to the happy!   We generally don't like the fake (unless it's fake fur/leather). We don't like fake in people (and all the lies/illusions/distortions/excuses/rationalizations/being emotionally frozen in childhood/etc.), and we certainly don't like the consequences of the fake. And fake food has to be made palatable so its makers (i.e., fakers) can brag about it being "real" and "authentic." It's not. All that glitters is not gold. Nope. Putting a disguise on something that's inherently phony cannot suddenly make that something "real." My fellow Yelpers, you can't fly like an eagle with the wings of a wren. There's nothing like being REAL. Nothing!  And no one does REAL better than Chef Sara. She doesn't need to brag about her food. (Only the fake needs a trumpet to brag about its alleged virtue and quality.) The food at Chef Sara's speaks for itself. And nothing's more REAL than when all the sugarcoating has worn off; when the mask has been chucked aside; when all pretense has been dropped; when all the lies have been untangled; when all the illusions have been stripped away; when the true colors are on display and all that's left is the absolute, unvarnished truth. Chef Sara's is real food; real flavor; and real healthy. Amen.

We walked in here "just looking," and we were serious about that claim (or so we thought).  Since we drove out with a brand-new vehicle. Which meant this dealership did something very right for us to not "shop around" as we told them (and ourselves) we were going to do.   Because I'll be the first to admit that car dealerships have developed a reputation for not being the most pleasant or scrupulous of operations. Just the mere thought of walking into these places is on many people's list as one of the worst things in life; often conjuring up cringe-worthy sensations such as fingernails screeching across a chalkboard, of causing your to skin crawl, as well as feeling the icy fingers of pain seeping into every pore of your body. In short, an experience that rubs you the wrong way, in more ways than one.   But this dealership put absolutely no pressure on us beyond saying they would bend over backwards to get our business, and I think they did just that. Which is why we went from seriously "just looking" to seriously buying in very short order.   We were encouraged by our salesperson from the get-go to look around and take our time (without having him tag along like melted gum on your shoe).  We even took two test drives of the vehicle we bought, and we were also told to drive it more than we actually did so we could be sure it was the right fit for us. And when it came time to talk numbers, we never even made an offer, other than stating what we wanted for our trade-in (which the dealership granted). And before we knew what hit us, the dealership had come down to a price we could easily live with - all as fast as the twinkling of an eye. (Meaning, we weren't there all day haggling over a price.) And, after the purchase, they filled up the vehicle with gas, completely cleaned it inside and out, and sent us on our merry way. With big smiles on our faces.   Thank you, Earnhardt Hyundai, for making the car-buying experience as easy as turning the page in a book. We'll definitely be back when it comes time to buy the next vehicle.

These guys are the absolute best! We've now bought two cars here in just over a year, and I can tell you that it has been an absolute pleasure to be involved with Earnhardt Hyundai in north Scottsdale. They are very deserving of my highest rating ever!  And I'm not saying that lightly, because it's easy to lavish praise on a company when everything goes well, and everyone's happy, and there's smooth sailing the entire time. (Such as what happened during the first vehicle purchase here. See previous Review.)   My fellow Yelpers, the true colors of an outfit come to the fore when something goes awry, and you're ultra-pissed off, your eyes smoldering with rage, and you're demanding action like a pitchfork brigade in an old horror film, and the company doesn't (legally) have to do a thing about any of it in your favor; especially when a big part of the problem was your fault in the first place.   And, my friends, my issue wasn't about a few pennies. We're talking about a sizable chunk of money here that just about any company on planet Earth would have just legitimately shrugged off, without a guilty conscience whatsoever, and say I made the whole thing up. If ever a company was to stand behind their stated practices of satisfying the customer, resolving a matter they didn't have to resolve to make someone happy, this instance (for me personally) was it.   Now the buying process, this second time around, was even better than the first; like a dream come true. They had the car I wanted, in the color I wanted, and a salesperson who was a treasure trove of information. Win. Win. Win. And in the time it takes to snap your fingers we had a deal; as effortless as a bird flying, and then coasting in for a soft landing. Landslide win!   I won't go into all the details about what happened after the contract was signed, but I wasn't even sure if, days after the fact, Earnhardt Hyundai would even take me and my concern seriously. As this matter was largely my fault for not catching, during or after, the negotiations and the signing of the contract. And it was only days later that I discovered a numerical disparity in the contract. One big enough for me to hit the roof and bang my head hard on it!    Legally, Earnhardt Hyundai didn't have to do a thing, nor take my word for what I was saying, nor refund me one red cent, much less the full amount. We had, after all, a signed, binding contract that didn't give me one leg to stand on. I was as helpless as a turtle on its back. Unless, Earnhardt Hyundai was willing to give me the benefit of the doubt and refund me the entire amount I said was "technically" due me. And now, because of how well they treated me, especially when they didn't have to, I'd say if they're willing to bend over backwards and go the extra ten miles for me, I have no doubt whatsoever they'll consistently do the right thing for others as well.    I can tell you, my fellow Yelpers, that these guys will take care of you. If you have a legitimate concern, they will do everything possible to make you happy. You will want to go back there again and again and again to buy your vehicles. And you, like me, will be proud to display that Earnhardt Hyundai logo on the back of your car.  I will be singing their praises for a long, long, long time to come. Bravo!  5+++ Stars!   You guys deserve it!

This airlines now flies out of Sky Harbor, but I would generally concur with the 2-star overall rating of this airlines. Yes, the prices are rock-bottom (even for last-minute booked flights), which is the ONLY reason anyone would ever want to consider flying with this business. Because you can expect every single flight to be delayed at least one hour. (That's been my experience after about a half-dozen flights.) And even though their website is up-to-date on flight times, if an incoming plane lands, they will quickly shuttle you onto that plane (calling "All zones") like scurrying rats, and you may actually leave BEFORE the time posted on their website. So beware if you think you have a boatload of time before takeoff only to find out the flight has already left the terminal when you arrive at your departure gate!  My most-recent flight  experience was like eating fresh fish from the latest oil-spill incident. The flight was (as usual) initially posted as delayed more than an hour, but that wasn't the big problem. Which occurred after the flight we were waiting on finally arrived, and we passengers were herded onto that plane like a fast-rushing river (presumably so we wouldn't arrive as late getting to our destination); where most of us then proceeded to sit on the plane - packed like 12 oz. of sardines jammed into 8 oz. cans - in just 5 airplane rows (while the rest of the seats on the entire plane were nearly empty) for two solid two hours before taking off! That, given very limited legroom on this airline, was not much fun. (Especially since we still had a 3-hour flight still ahead of us.)   I'm not sure if this is a common practice with this airlines or not to have people sit on a plane for hours prior to takeoff, but to rush passengers onto the plane like a mad dash to get out of a burning building, and then have us sit packed together like roll of coins for two hours seemed (to me) to indicate a serious lack of good judgment on the part of the employees of this airlines; to even have the passengers board in the first place (for a flight that wouldn't be taking off for another two hours) was (in my opinion) a mistake.    For it was only the AFTER the plane was leaving that we were told the plane (flying out of Minneapolis) suddenly needed to be "de-iced," but (I ask you) wasn't this fact known to this airlines BEFORE the mad dash of passengers onto the plane? And this is what took 2 solid hours for us to finally take off? Also, we were specifically instructed not to move to other seats until after takeoff (but that turned out to be two hours later) to "balance" out the plane. I can tell you this, it's not the passengers who need to be more "balanced."   But this sort of thing is typical with this airlines. It reminds me of public transportation, whereby standard operating procedure is run by-the-seat-of-their-pants. You get what you pay for with Spirit Airlines. So, to say the least, this latest experience of typical delays and lack of good judgment by this airlines left me with a sour taste in my mouth, the sound of the snap of the rubber glove, and the smell of a big box of week-old mackerel; and will likely be the last straw with me and this airlines, low prices or not, until they clean up their act. Let the flyer beware.

I love, Love, LOVE this place!  And it's not just because of the super-fresh, adventures in flavors that energize the palate. I also drink in with admiration Cutting Board Cafe's basic philosophy: "learn. eat. live" (in that order). One bite at a time.   Yes, the times they ARE a changin'! You know it's true when Mesa, AZ has itself a vegetarian/vegan bakery, restaurant, and coffee house!  And a cutting-edge one at that. For the menu is as lush as a rain forest with a rainbow of flavors and a satisfying taste sensation that rolls across your tongue with every bite!   Cutting board Cafe is a fast-casual place that serves up breakfast with such things as sweet potato hash, breakfast burrito, granola bowl, tamari tofu English muffin, freshly-baked cupcakes, seasonal fruit.   For lunch, there's appetizers consisting of olive tapas, bruschetta, hummus, veggies with walnut dip, and black and red bean salsa with chip. Entrees are mostly sandwiches and wraps (black bean burger, burritos, lentil cabbage wrap, veggie sandwiches), but there's also a vegan version of mac and cheese! And there's daily specials, as well as a ton of coffee choices, and, of course, great cupcakes and desserts. (I had the vegan macaroon... heavenly... love at first bite!)  Though my first adventure in savoring the flavor at Cutting Board Café was with the vegan tacos, featuring a truly amazing "meat" mixture made of walnuts, served on a pair of soft-as-a-marshmallow corn shell with blue corn chips and salsa on the side. But it wasn't the just taste of joy across my tongue with each bite of culinary delight that sold me on this place.   It's the whole concept of Cutting Board Café. Bringing awareness of the importance of food choices to Mesa, AZ, all in a cozy, bright setting; and how much our choices impact ourselves and the world.  And how each bite can reflect a taste of the good life... in Mesa, AZ. Try it. You'll like it!

If "5 Stars" is "as good as it gets" then 24 Carrots is well deserving of that rating. Because this place in its new location at Guadalupe Rd and McClintock Dr (just west of Baskin Robbins) is nothing short of phenomenal! The new venue boasts of a much larger dining area; is brightly lit (thanks to the entire north wall consisting of windows); has Vegan, Raw, and Gluten-free bakery items; as well as a cutting-edge Veg and Raw menu that consists of innumerable items that will absolutely-positively knock your socks off with flavor!    One thing that stands out at 24 Carrots, in comparison to other Veg restaurants of this type, is the freshness of the ingredients. Picture produce from local farms. And imagine that same produce being handpicked by the 24 Carrots' owner that very day. Then think taste explosion with each and every bite! As this isn't just a once-in-a-while sort of thing, 24 Carrots changes their menu weekly to reflect what's available from their dedicated local suppliers.  But the food at 24 Carrots is much more than just morsels as fresh as the morning dew. That's because 24 Carrots' redwoods-among-spruce reputation can be found in the sheer uniqueness and creativity of the menu items themselves. For this is no ordinary Veg food consisting of fake-meat sandwiches on vanilla-white bread or bland, grossly-overpriced rice bowls. Instead, you're getting is a bumper crop of culinary originality, food created by climbing mountains that other venues of this type have not yet dared to scale. And just when you think it can't get any better, 24 Carrots routinely tops themselves with some new flavor sensation that will curl your toes and shake, rattle, and roll your taste buds with utter delight!  Also, the new location has a much bigger staff, yet equally as friendly (thanks to greatly-expanded kitchen space having abundant room for more help), and that means they can now crank out their culinary masterpieces in short order.  And there's even comfy couches and chairs to sit on for people waiting for their lickety-split orders. Though, if time is not an issue, feel free to just hang out and sample one of their hit-the-spot juices or smoothies while you surf the web (and, of course, the Yelp website) on 24 Carrots' free Wi-Fi.     Overall, my two thumbs are up, waaaaaaaaaaaaayyyy up(!) for the new 24 Carrots, which is setting the bar awfully high for outstanding Veg and Raw food in the southeast Valley of the Sun. Bravo!

Not since Casey at the Bat struck out has been there so little joy in Mudville with a particular outfit. I say that because this restaurant's inauthentic name seems to speak volumes: RAW Organic Food+Juices. Well, first off, the food I've had here is NOT organic food. It's not. Now I'm not religious with organic food, but I've had enough of it over the years to know the difference between Nature's greatest glory and its pesticide-laden counterpart.   Secondly, the rain came and washed away all my dreams because there is a complete and total lack of "RAW" food cuisine, despite the all-caps portion of the venue name. Meaning, there is no "raw food" per se. Oh, I'll grant you that there are some RAW ingredients in some menu items, here and there. Yes, even McDonald's and Burger King can make that claim, but does that mean they ought to change their name to "RAW Organic Food" as well? Methinks not.   So yeah, there's some lettuce, some vegetables, and there's even some pretty fine guacamole found in some menu items. But the name, "RAW Organic Food" implies there is RAW food cuisine; i.e., creative concoctions consistently of purely UNCOOKED foodstuffs, which are all the rage with health-minded foodies in Southern California and points beyond. Unfortunately, at this venue, there isn't a single menu item that is entirely RAW. Not one. (Probably because much of "raw" cuisine - particularly the liberal use of nuts in many recipes - isn't exactly dirt cheap on the budget.) I can't help but think that this was their strategy here: We'll call it "raw" and "organic," but we'll use ultra-low-grade ingredients (such as lentils instead of nuts) that have cut-rate prices, as low as Christmas trees the day AFTER Christmas; and like a silver-tongued snake oil salesman, we'll sell it all as high-quality "health" food - laughing all the way to the bank in the process!  And us good little lemmings/customers walked right into their phony "health" food ambush; like Custer at the Little Big Horn, which didn't turn out so well for him.   Just know that when your name itself is false advertising, and your business practices are in line with that methodology, you're following directly in the footsteps of P.T. Barnum himself. But hey, let's face it, this location is smack dab in THE local hotbed of people with heavenly bodies and head-turning faces that would put Helen of Troy to shame; and, I suspect, the name of the restaurant is taking full advantage of its location to lure in that type of crowd with the "RAW Organic food" motif. So, I ask you, why not have something, ANYTHING(!) on the menu, that would reflect the name, other than non-Organic juices?  P.T. Barnum said it well: There's a sucker born every minute. And this place is in very good standing with his quick-buck-artist mentality.   Though, by most accounts, the food here is decent, even if it's not actually "raw" nor "organic." And I would mostly concur with that from my experience. (Though, just imagine how delish it would be if they actually stuck to their name!) I'm of the mind that you can't go wrong with many of the RAW ingredients actually found here (even when you are scraping the bottom of the barrel with ultra-cheapo ingredients like this place), and I haven't been disappointed with the taste of the food, other than from the sour taste it leaves me from it being neither "raw" nor "organic," as advertised. So my main concern with this place, and the reason for my lowly 2-star rating, is the integrity issue.  Honest Abe said it best himself, "You can't fool all of the people all of the time." (I'm also not the only one here on Yelp saying these things about this place, including the very first review.) And the fact is that the apple, no matter how you slice it, does not fall far from the tree - all in a dishonest day's work.  Overall, I'm giving this place an extra star for having more veggies than McDonald's, but seriously, the name has to go. And honestly, this is NORTH SCOTTSDALE! We don't go here expecting to get McDonald's with vegetables, and we're willing to spend more than you typically would at McDonald's. Ultimately, this venue's big cost-cutting strategy, and the willingness to sacrifice health under the guise of it, is a big turnoff to me. Try making an honest buck and you'll see it feels better. A lot better.   A quiet conscience sleeps in thunder.  6/1/2014 REBUTTAL TO OWNER: 1)You're not actually "RAW" if you don't have any RAW food cuisine on your menu. This is beyond dispute. (If, e.g., using cheapskate lentils and cooking them into oblivion, instead having real RAW food, makes you "honest" about RAW, then what is "dishonesty"?) 2)Send me a list of your current suppliers and I guarantee I'll contact them and that I'll positively confirm your "organic" status in a revised review. I'll also be contacting them periodically and updating my review here, as necessary, to ensure you really are "honest." This would be a win-win for everyone.

Closed???? Well, I'd call that just desserts! You see, my fellow Yelpers, when you cut corners, and take the easy way out, you ultimately get burned. What happened is that the word got out that this place was a fraud, and after that happened it never stood a chance. People, ultimately, want integrity from a business. I (and others) tried to say as much in a review, but the owner was deaf to our clanging alarm bells.  Try Sunshine Superfoods in Scottsdale for what this place only promised.
