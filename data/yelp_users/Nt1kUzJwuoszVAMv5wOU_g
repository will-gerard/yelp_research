One of our favorite places! My husband would eat here weekly if I let him. The staff is wonderful and the hot salsa sure is hot!  The food is always fast and good! We took my family here for a quick dinner when they came to visit. Everybody loved how good the food was and it's affordable. Love salsa Blanca!

The absolute best Thai food in Phx! So authentic, the food brought back some great memories of being in Thailand! Don't be fooled by its appearance. This place is a hidden gem and I send all my friends here.

Horrible service & food. This is my 3rd time here and I am so disappointed. My first visit was when they just opened and it took over an hour to get our food. Unfortunately we spent our entire lunch break waiting for food that never came. The second time was decent. But today, it took our waiter 30 min to bring us water and coffee. The food I ordered came out wrong and the hashbrowns were cold. When we told the waiter he proceeded to touch the hashbrowns with his fingers before he took it away. The biscuits were dry and hard and the gravy was grainy. I wish this place was better because it is so close to where we live but sadly we will not be back. I've tried this place multiple times and it is NOT worth it. If you want pricey & mediocre food with the worst service then this is your place.
