Get here for happy hour and make sure Cody (James Franco) is taking care of you. The food and drinks are delicious and the staff, especially Cody, rocks! I had the sorrento lemonade and it was really yummy!  We also ordered the bruschetta and that was one of the best bruschetta I have ever had! We had the baked mozzarella fonduta. The fonduta was a little rich for me and I like rich but still good.  The best part was the wait staff though. Very nice and super entertaining!! Cody and Joe kept us laughing the whole time!

Went back to see if the first time was a fluke and to see if the other reviews were right, but again we had AWESOME service! We had Joe this time and he was just as attentive as Cody was. Cody even recognized us and said hi! The waiters here are very fun and quick to serve us. I don't know why there are so many bad reviews because both experiences we have had here were great on all levels! Food service and ambience were all great!!!

Tried this place out for the first time on Halloween. Went around lunch time. When you walk in, you are greeted with a relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff. We ordered the bruschetta, and a medium pizza. They allowed us to do 1/2 gladiator and 1/2 Mykonos. SOOOOOO GOOD!!!! Like I said before, the wait staff was friendly and quick with service and recommendations.  DEFINITELY GOING BACK!!

I love it here. Darcy and Sheila are the best!!!  Has a great atmosphere and I love when they have special theme night.  Trivia night, karaoke, and holiday get togethers are always fun!  It's always a good time regardless of how many people are here!

We used to go to PF Chan's once a year or so, back in California. The meal was always good and we enjoyed ourselves. I told my husband I was craving Chinese food and this is where he took me. I was pretty excited.  We were seated promptly, and we were asked our drink order right away. I was having trouble deciding on our meal (we always share) and the waitress (SUPER NICE) started on the egg rolls for us. When I finally decided on our Chang's spicy chicken, I called the waitress over, and she told me one second. she came back right away with our egg rolls. They were delicious!!! defiantly the best part of the meal. we waited a little while then got our chicken. When deciding what to order, I had mentioned to the waitress that I didn't want anything too spicy, and she advised against the kung pao chicken, and said the Chang's chicken won't be too spicy. It was pretty freaking spicy!! I couldn't imagine how spicy the kung pao chicken would be. They knew we were splitting the meal, so they separated the rice into two bowls for us. The presentation of the chicken was pretty lack luster.... it didn't look special, just chunks of chicken in an orangish sauce, and it tasted about as good as it looked unfortunately..... The only reason I am giving this two stars is because of our waitress. She was very personable and nice, but her positive attitude did not make up for the meal that we paid $25 for. it was worth $10 at most. Very disappointed. I guess we will just have to go back to the one in California next time we are there.

We went here for dinner around 6. It was kind of confusing where to go and how to order until I asked someone. I feel that all of these restaurants (Joe's BBQ, Joe's Farm grill and here) are a little unorganized until you get the hand of it. We waited in line for about 15-20 minutes. I had ordered their burger of the week which was a Philly cheese steak burger with the garlic smashed potatoes, and my husband ordered the 6 alarm burger with fries. The Cheese Steak Burger was very yummy, although it lacked the cheese steak flavor I was looking for. The potatoes were to die for!!!! I love some garlic mashed potatoes, but these were probably one of the best I've ever had. My husband love hot food. He is the guy you see adding hot sauce to everything!!! Well he said that this was almost too hot for him! He took his first few bites and his eyes went wide with delight, then after letting the heat settle in, he realized how hot it truly was. His fries were not that good. He had said he would rather have fast food fries. I tried them and I was disappointed as well. They were cold and didn't have much flavor to them. By the time we left we were both super full. We usually share a meal, but wanted to try  the things we wanted for our first time there.  The one thing I will say is that we had to run to the bathroom when we got home.... Im not sure why, but the food didn't settle well. But boy did it taste good!!  A day later, I'm regretting every delicious bite. My husband and I had been sick all day =(

After talking to the GM (and being told that what we experienced was an enigma) we decided to head back to liberty market and give it another try.  We went for a late lunch/early dinner. We decided to share the tower burger with bacon on it with a side of Caprese Pasta Salad. I should add that we share meals all the time. That way we don't have left overs to bring home and we don't over eat.  The burger with the garlic aioli was SOOO GOOD!! The pineapple salsa was also pretty great. I usually don't like that kind of topping but it was definitely an awesome additive to the burger.  The pasta salad was so fresh. It tasted like it was all picked out of the garden rift before it was made.  My only complaint is the amount of food you get for the price you are paying. We got a burger, the salad, and a fountain drink for $17. Usually that's right around what we pay for that but we leave full. Today we were both still hungry. If we got bigger portions, this restaurant would be 5+ stars. The chefs really know what they are doing when it comes to what they put in their food.  Definitely going back!! I have heard the salt river bars are to die for and I need to get my hands on one!

I recently had a horrible experience at the Cooper and Warner Frys, but Zhyra made my experience at this location an excellent one! I live right near Warner and McQueen, but because she was so kind, Im inclined to drive the distance to this location.

Went there for the first time last night and boy was I surprised.  I read the reviews before I got tickets and boy was I happy I did. Ordered our tickets online and RESERVED our reclining seats.  The prices weren't horrible but boy is it expensive to see a movie in theaters. Didn't even bother with snacks because they looked pretty pricy as well.  Since we bought our tickets online, all we had to do was go in and have the ticket person scan our phone to show the ticket. The person told us the theater number and our seat number and off we went.  I was so pleased by the seats. I have a bad hip and sitting in the normal seats for too long hurts but this seat reclined all the way and I was comfortable though out the whole movie.  I would only go back to this theatre. And the main reason is because of the seats!

My husband loves this Home Depot. They are always friendly and helpful and we get in and out fast. Sometimes it's hard to find people when you have a question, but once you get your hands on someone, it's smooth sailing.  In the summer we usually bring our dog here to, just to walk the aisles. (support animal) they know him by name and are super excited to see him when he comes with.

I went there to get a bathing suit for Physical Therapy and for summer. Im a busty girl... it runs in the family, and this makes finding a cute but supportive bathing suit HARD! I was told by a few people that they had a nice selection and cute suits here so I figured Id stop in and take a look. Upon being greeted, I explained my situation and what I was looking for, and the sales person looked at me like I was an idiot for having big boobs or something... Its not like I had bought the suckers, and even if I had, that would be my choice and none of their business! She was kind of rude from start to finish. Explaining that for my bust size, but small waist, that the only suits they had to offer were pretty matronly.... Im 25.... not really wanting to look like a grandma. To say the least, after the comment about me spilling out of the last suit she suggested for me (knowing my size), I left.  horrible customer service =(

This food was fantastic! The line was a tad long, and for someone with a hip issue, that part was not enjoyable. Normally my husband would have just ordered for me, but since this was our first time there, I wanted to see everything and choose what I wanted from there.  I ordered just the baked potato, and the thing was HUGE!! I was told you can ask for as much toppings as you wanted, but I just let them do their thing. I next time I'll as for more sour cream and butter =) My husband had a pulled pork sandwich. He had said that he would have liked more sauce on it, and instead of getting just a side of sauce, he would bring his whole sandwich up to the sauce. Over all, it was delicious, but I would have liked to know how it worked before we had gone. maybe this will help future newbies when they go.  also.... bring someone who know what they want, and order it for them while they go and steal a table as soon as they can. It gets super busy for dinner!!!

This looks like no big deal from the out side, but then you bite into the sandwich! I am a firm believer in not judging a book by it's cover and this is a perfect example! The food here is so good and the service is fantastic. The older daughter of the owner  and the owner are the sweetest women I've met in Arizona! When I walk in, I feel like I am always greeted so warmly and they are always so kind.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone from the east coast looking for a bite of home, or anyone who respects and appreciates great food!!  My one suggestion, preorder your food. It can get super busy in there at times!

I don't usually give 1 star reviews to burgers. I love my burgers and if you've read any of my other reviews, you'd know that.... We decided to go here for lunch because I revived a coupon in an email. you can't go wrong with a $6.99 burger!! Well as always we were ready to order pretty quickly when the waiter came to our table. We ordered a blooming onion and we also ordered the burger to share like always (portion control and no left overs). We ordered the burger with cheddar cheese and no tomato. The waiter even double checked a few minutes later to make sure he placed the order with the right cheese. He was very nice to start off and quick with the service. When we got the blooming onion, I had mentioned to my husband that it tasted burnt. He though maybe it was just their time to change the oil. We ate around the onion hoping to find some better parts, but it mostly all tasted burt. Just to make sure the business was aware (I'm sure they don't taste every item they serve) I wanted to let the waiter know that it either was burnt or they should test the oil to see if they need to change it. He gave a hasty sorry then went to the back.  Then we go our burger. We didn't ask them to, but they were nice enough to even cut the burger in half and put it and the fries on two separate plate! I took the top bun off to add some salt and pepper and noticed there was no cheese on the burger at all, and there was a big juicy tomato on the burger.... My husband has NEVER been one to complain about his food at a restaurant. "you eat what you're given".... I believe that if you order something a specific way, and you're paying extra for cheese, It should come the way you order it. Not wanting to upset my husband, we began to eat. The waiter came around asking how it was, and at that point, I let him know that there was no cheese and he had saw the tomato picked off on the side of my plate.  He had offered to take it back and remake it, but I always get nervous about restaurants remaking food.... I have see the movie Waiting too many times to feel comfortable doing that. I wasn't expecting money to be off my bill, but I was expecting a big apology and a thanks for the heads up that the cooks were not doing their jobs properly.... I didn't get any of the above...  I am so utterly disappointed with the service and food quality we received. Outback is one.... WAS one of my favorite restaurants. I don't think we will be going back. At least never to this one again.

I shop at this frys ALL THE TIME, and up until yesterday, Ive never had a bad experience.  Yesterday I went into the store looking for Fig jam/spread/preserves. My husband was at another frys earlier that day, and said he saw some with the specialty cheese.  I went and looked over there first and didn't see it. Saw a nice employee in the produce area and asked for his help, and he directed me to the deli department and to ask them. The deli department told me to ask produce..... After that, I went to the customer service desk to ask them. No one was at the counter.... Another employee, walked by and asked if I needed help, and we went to the jelly aisle to check there and nothing. She then paged for the manager (I believe his name was TJ) and he proceeded to tell me that they didn't have it in any of the frys stores....  I let him know that my husband had seen it at one just earlier that day, and he insisted, rather rudely, that he had checked multiple locations and nothing came up.... That employee that walked by's name was Fitore and she recruited Sarah and the two of them were SUPER friendly, and tried to help to the best of their efforts!! Needless to say, after that I replaced the items that I had in my cart, back to their rightful place, and then I left. I have never been treated so rudely before at a frys. The people who tried to help along the way had been very kind, then out of all the people I would have expect to have the most excellent customer service, was just rude! Today, while running errands, I decided to go back the frys my husband had seen it at, and it was exactly where he said it would be. While looking for it, I was greeted by Zhyra and she was SUPER nice and helpful.... Im sticking with that frys from now on even if it is 6+ miles away, and this location is less then a mile away.

We had seen a ton of reviews on this place! My brother from Buffalo, NY even called me to tell me to go there because he had seen it on a food tv show. When I informed him that we had gone there already, and it wasn't all that great, he was disappointed. I love pizza and wings! Wings are a touch subject for me and my husband since we are from buffalo... Well theirs were just average. nothing special, kind of small.  We got a pizza, wings and garlic knots. Out of these three things, nothing grabbed my attention enough to make me what to go back. It was quick getting our food, and the service was nice, but the food wasn't fantastic unfortunately.

We went there early on a Saturday for dinner thinking it wouldn't be that busy, but I was crazy in there! We were told it would be a 45 minute wait, but it wasn't that long.  My husband and I usually try to be in and out of restaurants within an hour to an hour  and a half. We usually look at the menu while we wait to be seated so we can order right away. We knew the food we wanted but we weren't sure what we wanted to drink. We asked our waitress, Kelly, her suggestion and we are glad we did. The berry hard cider was DELICIOUS!  My husband ordered the pork sandwich and I got the Mac and cheese burger. I was shocked how quickly we got our food!! It was sooo great! Everything was hot off the grill and cooked the way we requested it. The potato salad and fries were scrumptious too.  It was louder in there then I expected, but it's a bar so I shouldn't be surprised.  Over all I was pleasantly surprised and it was very yummy!!

This was our first visit here.  As usual, I stuck to the burgers and ordered the Marzen bbq burger to split with my husband. We also split an individual California beach taco. (My first time having a fish taco)  I was shocked by the size of the taco. Very small!! Although it was small, it was pretty yummy.  The burger was DELICIOUS! I'm a burger freak and this was by far one of the best burgers I've had in a while. The garlic fries it came with were equally as delicious!!  Our waitress Katie was very nice and entertaining! She went out of our way to make us happy, and that isn't something you find lately in service.  Over all an awesome experience and we will defiantly be back!

We went here tonight to try to find a pair of jeans for my husband. He recently decided to do yard work in his only good pair, and it was safe to say that they didn't cut it for going out in anymore.  When we got there a very short woman greeted us and started helping us right away.  I understand that buckle quality jeans are not cheap, but we told her we wanted to stay under $100. At the buckle in the chandler mall, if you give them a budget they stick to it, here however, the woman helping us kept suggesting jeans over $100 still. I understand they work on commission but she was being rather pushy and too attentive, I would go as far as saying "in your face" type of attention.  With my help, and scurrying off away from the person helping us, I found a few contenders, but none of them fit the way he wanted them to. And let's face it, if you're paying $100 for a pair of jeans, you better love them!! The staff at the buckle at the Chandler mall seemed much more helpful without being annoying. We will stick to that one.

Went back today after deciding not to go to the chandler one anymore because of the manager there and had a pretty great experience. Had to do an exchange and the assistant manager there, Garrett was super helpful and made my second time back here much better then the first experience!!!! Sticking to this store since my go to girl is no longer at the Chandler location!!

We ate there tonight but we were nervous to because of the reviews. Much to our surprise we had fabulous service. Our waiter, Ron was so nice and personable. We had a small issue with our food but when we brought it to Ron's attention, Daniel the manager took care of it instantly. He was so nice and generous even though it was a minuscule mistake.  I don't know how the past few reviews were so bad. Wild wings are usually the same across the board. Its wings. They are going to be a little greasy. But they are delicious that way!! We had a great time here tonight!!

I have never had Thai food before. My husband is always ranting and raving about it. We had been asking friends and looking at yelp to help us decide on my first Thai experience. Based on what we've heard, we picked here! I believe it was the manager, Ray, he greeted us right away and was super personable. Throughout our entire meal he was checking in with us.  It was slow, but we try to do that on purpose. We hate when restaurants are crazy busy (by the time we left, it was filling up!) When our waiter, Dennis, came over, I explained I had never had Thai before and I  asked what he would recommend for someone new to Thai. He asked me a few questions, what I liked and didn't like, if I had any allergies, and then off he went.  We got spring rolls as an app and my husband got pearl of Thai land and I believe I got rad nar.  It was delicious. My husband tore through his! He said it was awesome. I had a bit me of his and my mouth was on FIRE! The waiter noticed and brought me over some Thai tea. He was SOOO attentive!!!   Our meals were good but to be honest, the service made the experience. I will defiantly be coming back and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to feel like that's matter and they aren't just another customer.

Went there today with my husband and emotional support dog (which isn't required to wear a vest) and was told I was not allowed to have him there. I then told the employee that I have the papers that I could show them and she said that he isn't allowed still. At that point my husband and I left.  I was very disappointed with the level of customer service. What they did was completely inconsiderate and illegal. I'll go to Home Depot for my pumpkins from now on!

We went here last night for dinner.  My husband ordered the fettuccine alfredo and I did the rosemary garlic chicken.  My husband ate about 1/4 of his meal, and his stomach started to get really upset. He waited a bit, then took a few more bites and his stomach got worse.  My chicken was pretty good. It was light and flavorful.  My husbands stomach was still pretty upset until mid-afternoon today.  Probably going to stay clear of this Olive Garden from now on.

Ive gotten my eyebrows threaded a ton of times. When I get waxed, I always get a bunch of pimple like bumps, a ton of irritation, and it never looks like a clean line. Threading is usually a lot more painful then waxing, but it was less painful this time. It was kind of difficult to find the location, because my GPS said it was on the other side of the road. The curb appeal of the location is lacking but don't judge a book by its cover! Renu is GREAT!! I am usually really red for at least three hours after, but my skin around my eyebrows were like normal after an hour.  Most of the time there are stray hairs I have to get, but I had a nice clean line, with no stray hairs. This was by far the best eyebrow threading experience I have ever had!! Next time I need my eyebrows done, I wouldn't choose anywhere else! I would suggest Renu to anyone who asks me a good place to get threading. I am looking forward to trying the other skin care treatments she has available!

I'm usually an easy to please eater. Almost everywhere I go, I'll get a burger. I got the sliders here and they left a lot to be desired. They were strictly meat, cheese and onions.... That's it. No mayo, no pickle no lettuce. Nothing. My husband got the pulled pork sliders and they were cold. I thought it might be the coleslaw, but they were cold throughout the whole thing.  Defiantly not what we expected. I don't know if we will be back unless we just plan to drink.  Our bartender was nice though =)

The first time we had gone here wasn't the best experience. We had a couple sitting next to us arguing the whole time quite loudly, and that made the whole experience really uncomfortable and we couldn't really enjoy our food, because we just wanted to get out of there! I went back with a girlfriend, and it was very enjoyable!! Love the blinis! and I can't get enough of their bruschetta!!  I really like that they also offer a half sandwich, have salad or soup deal!!! Its nice to get a little bit of everything with the half deal! Over all, this is my go to place for when I have friends/family in town who really enjoy wine, and yummy food!

This was my first ever facial, and I was a bit nervous. I was pleased with the fact that Summer didn't want me to commit to a package before she knew my skin type and which treatment I would benefit most from. She suggested a skin analysis and I agreed. She was so friendly and personable yet professional and I find that that is a hard combination to come by.  By the time I was done filling out paperwork and ready to begin, I felt completely comfortable trusting what ever Summer suggested.  I will defiantly be going back to glam skin for more treatment in the future as well as following all the great advice Summer gave me!

Every time I come here my dog ends up looking adorable, and if there is something I don't like they are always willing to fix him up to my liking. VERY fast and best of all cage free!! Last time I was in, I forgot to mention something I wanted done, and without hesitation they said they would fix it for me. I love how the always make sure you leave happy with your pets cut!  Over all, GREAT grooming, very friendly staff and I leave happy!

I LOVE this place!! The owner buys many of their items locally and is very involved in her community. Every time I go into the store, there is something new to look at! There is always a huge selection for all of the needs too!! The thing I love most about this store is that the products are top notch quality!! I bought a necklace there that I wear pretty much every day a while ago, and it still looks as new as the day I purchased it!! The customer service of the store is also excellent! I love how every time I go there, I feel like a VIP!! I would defiantly suggest this store to anyone who wants top quality service and products =)

We went here a few weeks ago. We go the loaded fries, and the original zinburger. The fires were delicious, however because of their open building, they got cold rather quick and that kind of stunk =( The zinburger tasted like they had just got the meat straight for the cow that day! It was soon fresh and delicious. My husband didn't really like the texture of the burger, but i think it had to do with the caramelized onions. Over all, I would definartly go back!

We have been trying to branch out lately. I've really been into fish tacos so we thought we'd give them a try.  When we walked in it took a little to be noticed. I'm used to being greeted right away and "I'll be with you" but that didn't happen. When we were greeted, they said to sit anywhere.  Someone then brought us menus, and plastic forks. The plastic forks were placed right on top of the menu with no napkins.... That seemed unsanitary and really turned off my husband.  We got the crab cakes and the beer battered mahi tacos. It states on the menu that you get beans and rice for sides.  We waited a little but they were pretty busy so the wait was what was expected. When we got our food, we were both surprised by how tiny the sides were for the tacos! It was in a small cup the size of the cups you put ketchup or mustard in!  Our waitress said she would bring us napkins, and never did. Again, it was busy... But still. The crab cakes were good. Not anything special. The tarter sauce that came with it tasted like ranch dressing. Again nothing special.  The fish tacos were bigger then most I've seen. They had an odd taste though. We think it may be the cheese they choose.  At the end when we got our check and saw that for the small amount of food we got cost $20, we both decided we will not be going back based on the price for the quality and portion size.

I would give it maybe 2.5 if I could but it was over priced, very unorganized, the staff was not trained very well and waited forever for our check. The food was just ok.  I nibbled on my friends deep dish pizza, and it wasn't great. I ordered a red sangria and it was ridiculously sour!! so sour that it made my stomach upset.
