I'm sorry to write a bad review, I normally LOVE Zipps. Recently, however, with the latest heatwave here in AZ, Zipps air conditioning has sucked! I don't understand how they can spend TONS of money on new flooring for the bar, but skip out on the one thing that would make guests more comfortable. Zipps ownership, PLEASE upgrade the AC at the Gilbert location!

Carl Johnson is an amazing accountant and person.  We have been working with Carl since 2008.  We were referred by a family friend and have never regretted our decision to have Carl complete our taxes every year.  He is kind, effective, detail oriented, and goes above and beyond the expectations of his job.  I highly recommend Carl Johnson of One Source Accounting Solutions for all accounting services.  Keep up the great work Carl!
