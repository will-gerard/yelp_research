We have been to this restaurant multiple times. The restaurant serves both Asian and Italian dishes. This is my hubby's favorite place for ramen noodles and he told me the broth is pretty close to the flavors you'd find in ramen houses in Tokyo. According to one of the employees, the broth cooks for at least 6 to 8 hours to develop its rich flavor. The pasta with squid and cod roe is also a favorite. Too bad we live so far from it, otherwise we would go much more frequently.  Be sure after dinner to stop by Snoh Creamery a few doors down. The shaved ice is creamy and delicious.

Customer service is pretty good... The saleslady there really took the time to help me pick bridal jewelry for my wedding, which I appreciated.

Lovely restaurant, but below average food. I was surprised they didn't offer offer one vegetarian entree on the menu, as most restaurants now do.  Tortillas were cold and tough to chew, the taco meat entree that came with rice and beans included, that I requested a vegetarian substitute, did not come with rice, which is beyond me in terms of reasoning.  I had even asked when i was ordering to make sure rice was included.  Fianc√© had the carne de fuego, which did not have any sides or tortillas with it, which we would have expected. Below average service, took 10 minutes of waiting after we were done before any one noticed to take our plates away.  Its a damn shame we had such a bad experience, as it is a nice looking property and we were thinking of possibly having our rehearsal dinner here.  Unfortunately, we won't be back.

Love this place. Great selection of vegetarian items, all tasty, and buffet comes with two dosas sent to your table. I always leave here very stuffed.

One of the best Mexican meals I've had in the Valley. Really flavorful rice and beans and enchiladas. Looking forward to trying other items on the menu.

After trying out almost every Volvo repair shop in the Valley, I think I've found the best place to take my car, even if it takes almost an hour to get there from my home. From the minute you walk in Derrick is at the front desk and is warm and friendly. They aren't overly aggressive with treatment recommendations for your car (unlike my unpleasant experiences at the  Volvo dealership) and do a good job with their repairs. Tanner Motors also give nice little thank you gifts they'll put inside your car after service, which is a nice touch. They focus on doing a job well done and good customer service at reasonable prices, so there's no shuttle taking you around if your car is being fixed, free car washes, etc. The only thing that it is inconvenient is that it's a little difficult to go anywhere entertaining if you need to get your car fixed and no one is taking you away for a couple hours, unless you walk a couple blocks to Biltmore Fashion Square or possibly another couple blocks to The Changing Hands bookstore. They do have a small waiting area with free wi-fi but the waiting area is tiny. But those are minor inconveniences since I know I am getting great service from a repair shop that I trust at reasonable prices.

Very delicious food. The hubby got the leg of lamb kabob and I got a veggie naan-wich. The spinach rice was very good, and was our favorite part of the meal, although everything was so tasty. We were surprised this restaurant isn't busy when we were there, because the food is excellent. It's a little far out from where we live, but we would like to come back.

I'm surprised there aren't that many reviews on this place. It looks like it used to be a fast food joint, and is lacking in decor and atmosphere, but you will see quite a few Asian people dining here, which is always a good sign if you want authentic Hong Kong food. Important to know there are two menus - the Americanized Chinese menu, and the Chinese Chinese menu. We've never ordered from the American Chinese menu - if you want authentic flavors, ask for the Chinese menu, which does have English descriptions. I'm vegetarian, so I can't speak for most of the food (which I heard from my dining companions were excellent), but even non-vegetarians enjoyed the Buddhist Style rolls, which are vegetable-stuffed rolls made from tofu skin and fried. So delicious. We will come back, even though it's a bit of a drive for us!
