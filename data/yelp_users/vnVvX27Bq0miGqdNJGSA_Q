I love the UPS store this location is no exception. Every employee is so friendly! Not to mention the service is lightning fast. I wish every shipping experience could be as easy and friendly as it is with UPS and it's staff.

I would give the Safeway negative stars if it were an option. Bobby W the "manager" is extremely unprofessional, rude, and ignorant. If the attitude "it's not my job" is what you're looking for this is the man to speak to you. Also this is the dirtiest Safeway I've ever seen.

I came into this Sally's at 8:30pm (30 minutes before they close) because of a coloring Catastrophe. The two girls working rolled their Eyes when they saw a customer had entered the store. They Were already counting the drawer as if it were 5 min. Till close. I had questions And was Ignored even though there was no one else in the store. My roots were the same color as Ronald McDonald's for pete's sake!! Ladies help me out here!!!?? I love Sally's but this location really let me down.

Overpriced, no customer service, weak selection. I stood at the paint counter for 25 minutes while homegirl tweeted her plans for the weekend instead of helping me.

I didn't catch the name of the charming young man who just assisted me in shipping my package but, he was dynamite!!  He printed my drop-off receipt and put it on a flyer with coupons and presented it to me with a hand motion like Bob Barker's beauties on the price is right!  Bless his heart, he is an absolute gem!

Okay despite everyone's glowing reviews this place is absurd!! The woman working the register Shari was not only rude but condescending to boot. I bought a blender for $15 (not even a high-end blender I'm talking a Hamilton Beach number) and when I got to my car I saw the lid was cracked but it had been taped together. The tag on the appliance said "tested works great perfect condition", & I figured in a Christian thrift shop you could trust this to be true. When I showed the defect to Shari she smugly told me it was unfortunate and there was nothing she could do.    PS when they have 50% off items you get to choose whether you want 50% off a single item or to be questioned whether or not the coupon you have downloaded from their website is valid?!?!!  I strongly urge you to spend your money at a "Christian" thrift store that actually practices Christian values..... amen!

This hotel rocks my world! The whirlpool room is perfectly luxe without being over-the-top. Morgan at the front desk is the nicest most helpful person you could ever dream of. If you are visiting PHX this is the place to stay!

I can remember when the restore was actually priced like a resale store. The used building materials they are selling are priced higher than one could purchase them from say The Home Depot brand new.

Big ups to jake!!!! I will never trust another with any of my Mac products. He took the time to explain what was wrong and even offered cost-effective solutions to meet my needs. Not to mention the staff are super friendly and pretty fun to around! Check this place out!

As packed & busy as it was, the guys who were working here today are awesome! They were friendly and knowledgeable and even went out of their way to help me print out a label because my printer ran out of ink this morning. If you need to mail a package I definitely recommend this location.

I have been dying to have my tattoo removed for almost a decade. I am so happy I waited and found Delete Tattoo Removal & Laser Salon. I saw Dr. Chung who is not only the most compassionate and personable Dr. I have ever met I would gladly go to happy hour with her any day of the week because she's hilarious! I am so pleased with the results of my first session I want to scream her praises from the rooftops! Check out the website because they do it all (the staff is so wonderful you will want to move-in). www.deleteitnow.com

SCARY! If you enjoy being shoved, slapped, and stepped on for ripped jeans from Walmart, then this is the joint for you! Side note: wear gloves, a respirator, and hazmat suit if you don't want to contract hepatitis or TB!

This place is LEGIT! The owner and employees are nothing but friendly and helpful. The prices are so good, you'll think you'd died and gone to heaven! They have a wide variety of upscale products at amazingly low prices. This place is a hidden gem. I purchased two gorgeous wall sconces brand new in the box for $26!

Just when I thought I couldn't be more impressed with the courtesy and professionalism of a business, Gemtime Watch and Jewelry Service Center shows me what true excellence in workmanship is and sets the standard for courtesy and professionalism. I wish I could tell everyone taking their repairs anywhere else that they are making a huge mistake. Gemtime is a shining example of what a business should be.

This place is totally worth checking out. If you are in the market for a high end used appliance and want a great deal go see Julie. Not only was the entire staff courteous and helpful they were fun. Julie took the time to explain each and every feature of the appliance I was buying and even gave tips on how to keep the appliance running at its best. This is a business that you can tell genuinely cares about their customers and fully stand behind the products they sell. I will definitely shop here again.

I must say go on record that this is 100% without a doubt my absolute favorite thrift shop in Phoenix. The items are wonderful and priced to sell (unlike so many other thrift shops). The employees are the greatest group of women who never fail to make make me laugh and leave with a smile (not just because of the incredible items I got at such an unbelievable price).  I also feel good because this shop is 100% nonprofit and every penny made goes to helping the Boxers!!!  I really cannot give enough praise to this place, LOVE IT!!!!!

I was 2 seconds away from a nervous breakdown when my Iphone back fell off. I  saw the shop and decided to take a chance that I wouldn't be charged 2 million dollars to replace it. I was so surprised and impressed with how reasonable the prices were and how quickly my repair was completed. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants quality repair work at an excellent price.

It is what it is....an off-price retailer of outerwear in the desert.  Good prices for mediocre goods. I'd go to Ross first folks!

Trina is the go-to girl for knowing what you need to look to-die-for. I had heard JC.Penney had come a long way in the style department so I decided to check it out. I was not disappointed, old JC has stepped it up big time! So I am trying this amazing cashmere sweater ($19.99 + 25% off on a well-stocked clearance rack). It was then that  whatever emo rock song that was playing over the sound system caused me to have an emotional break-down and I just started to cry? (it had been a long day for the record).  I emerged from the fitting room triumphant in my sweater score but was crushed when I realized I looked like a racoon (my mascara was down to my ankles). I sprinted to the Sephora (located conveniently in the center of the JC.Penney store). I was immediately greeted and comforted by Trina who took all of two seconds to access the damage and spring into action to remedy the situation. I am VERY particular about how my makeup is applied (some might say psycho) and Trina took the time to ask me how I wanted to look and then went to work. I have to say Trina knows her stuff (product, application, little hints & tips, the whole deal). So, right on JC and Sephora and Trina!!!!

Your stock is still rising big-time Sephora inside JCP. Cynthia Dominguez, you are a dynamo with makeup for the eyes! I went into Sephora to buy some eyeshadow primer but when I saw Cynthia's eye makeup (which was the very definition of perfection), I was like; "Hold the phones!".... She sat me down and did me up so well that my anti-make-up friend wanted hers done too. I live nowhere near this Sephora location but I will gladly make the trek for the quality of service this location provides.  Side note to the ladies who helped me; I apologize for how incredibly rude my friend was. She was raised by wolves and doesn't know any better (at least that's the only reasonable conclusion I can come up with).

Negative 5 stars for these teenage wannabe fashionistas! Not only are they rude and condescending they are criminals. I was given $27 in cash for A pair of authentic Katz Ray-Ban sunglasses, 8 pairs of Miss Me jeans (not that I really care because no one wears those anymore), 4 pairs of J Brand jeans, 3 pairs of true religion jeans, and a pair of very rare Hudson jeans, and a rather large quantity of vintage jewelry, not to mention a whole slew of really cool vintage T-shirts, skirts, dresses, etc. I thought the $27 seemed a bit low and when I asked to see what they had purchased the bin was gone!!! I had not left the store I actually stayed there and waited while they made the buy. When I asked for the manager she was conveniently on break. My advice to you do not shop or sell to this establishment! Bad karma going on in there.

This place is amazing. Vanessa saved my life, she's wonderful. I couldn't figure out how to refill my Vape and she took the time to show me how. She informed me I was over tightening and that was causing my problem. The interior of the store is gorgeous. The new location you have to check it out.
