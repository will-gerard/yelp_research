I used to be a regular here at Ohya for this place is located very close to my school (ASU west). I came here on many occasions with friends and have introduced many people to this spot. I normally get okay service however my last visit was very unexpectedly inappropriate. My waiter found me on social media after my visit just to comment about his tip.  Let me start from the beginning, my friend brought me here on my birthday, a Saturday around 3pm. Before arrival we called and ordered a few sushi rolls ahead of time over the phone because we were in a hurry and they usually take a long time to make your rolls from my previous visits. Since the food was ready by the time we got there, we were in and out within 20 minutes. I wasn't sure if the waitress dining the table next to us was our waitress because no one checked up on us, but by the time we were done eating and ready for the bill our waiter finally came to refill our drinks. (it was surprisingly not busy there for a Saturday however, it was 3pm). My friend tipped according to how much service he gave which was 10% of the bill.   The day after on a Sunday night, I received a comment on a photo I posted of their food on instagram a month ago (with the same rolls I ordered from my last visit). It was from the waiter making a comment about how low I tipped him. I was extremely shocked and have no idea how he found me. I thought it was inappropriate and uncomfortable for him to find me on social media and have to say something just because of a tip. Either way tipping is optional and I usually tip 20%, however my friend tipped according to how much service he gave us. I replied back to him asking what his name was and he deleted his comment. See the photos I posted of screen shots of the incident and his IG profile to avoid him if you visit. I now feel very uncomfortable returning to this restaurant over the situation that occurred and will not be bringing my friends here if this is the kind of service I get back.   EDIT: I reached out to the owner with the same story and after further investigation he let go of the waiter. You are now safe to come eat here without being stalked!

Everytime I come here it is always crazy busy. Filled with all kinds of diverse groups of people. Even though they serve so many tables at once they are very fast at bringing your table drinks, refills, and food. Ive never have to wait long for anything. However the servers here aren't the ones to talk to you at all they just give you what you need and go which is fine with me, I came here to eat! I like their food but I've had better grilled pork. This place is very cheap compared to other pho restaurants I've been to I believe it came out to $13 for two people ?

Writing this review for students looking for a place to study. It's a small Starbucks but really good size tables and outlets, I thought I hit jack pot when I found this hidden Starbucks since it was so empty compared to the one on 83rd and bell however I realized the reason why. They crank the AC to -30 degrees. I'm the type to like my place cold too but how they do it is literally painful and I come dressed prepared to be in the cold. While studying here I've seen people go outside to wait for their drinks cause it was so cold inside. They do take a while to make drinks and you get a hit or miss with the baristas, I've met one that knew my name and drink after one visit and others that were absolutely awful. Parking is very limited I've had to park on the other end of the lot but the drive through always seems empty and quick.

Soooooooooooooo much food !!! A box will range from $8/9 and there's more than enough for leftovers. You're getting two meals for the price of one.  Leos never fail to satisfy me the food isn't made until you order so you do have to wait for a little but we'll worth the wait . I like the chicken combo ( bbq chicken + Katsu) but the Katsu box comes with so much more meat. They have prepackaged teriyaki and Katsu sauce in plastic containers easy to grab you don't have to ask so you can grab as much as you'd like. I'm a regular loyal customer for life.

When I came in it was crazy busy as if it was black Friday. Not a clean environment and there was dust and fingerprints all over the display racks of the glasses. Though I had an appointment, I wasn't seen until 40 minutes later. I was in and out of the exam room so quickly less than 5 minutes but somehow I was in the store for a total of 2 hours. They had a 'sale'; buy one $69, get one ($69) free. You get what you paid for and there aren't many attractive frames for the low prices. I ended up paying $220!!!! for two $69 glasses that were plastic frames after lenses and taxes?  A week or two later I came in to pick up my two glasses and one of them scratched my face while I was trying them on. I told the person attending me and she felt the sharpness on the frames herself and said she would place a new order of frames for me and I would receive a call.   About a week or two later I never received a call, so I called in and the person who answered told me there was no order in for me and that she'll check on it tomorrow and call me back. I never received a call back so I called again a few days later and was told she didn't know what I was talking about so they had to call me back again because her manager is on break. I received a call saying my glasses were in the back and are in to pick up.  I came to pick them up only to notice that the part of the frames that was scratching my face was only noticeably shaven down and felt very rough and not smooth in comparison to the other side of the frame. I told the person who attended me that it looks like it was just shaven down and she responded saying no they're completely new frames, I had to repeat myself 3x and asked her to feel the frame herself before she actually looked at the frame. When she noticed something was wrong she stepped aside, not sure what she did but it felt more shaven down.   I pretty much had to wait another two weeks and waste my time coming back in to NOT get new frames, but for them to just shave it down. If that's what they were going to do in the first place, I wouldn't have even bothered and could have done it myself with a nail file since it is so noticeable. At first I didn't mind the run down place and the long wait as long as I received my glasses, but if I'm going to pay $200 to also get damaged glasses too, I will not be back and definitely will not recommend anyone to come here.

I usually go to pho avina as it is by my school but I tried this place out and the service is so much better compared to pho avina. Servers are great and food comes quickly. Price is probably a dollar or so more than my usual spot but the service and the nice restaurant is well worth it going out of your way. The food is great, but THE BOBA, they need to have more credit for their boba because they have the best I've tried in the valley for what I order ( taro coconut snow ) the most creamy Boba I've ever had. Better than bomboba, yo&i, and pho avina. I come here just for the Boba for the most part.

My favorite hibachi place closed down so I was in the look out for a new spot. What actually attracted me to go here instead of Ah-So was the photos of the restaurant. This place definitely has nice decor and I loved it, it was even nicer in person. This would be a very nice place to bring someone on a date.  It looks small from the outside but it is quite big inside, they have a separate area from the regular dining and teppanyaki. I made a reservation online for Easter at 6pm on a Sunday and requested a hibachi chef with the best showmanship for an entertaining show and I definitely received one! Sadly, I did not catch his name but I can say he was a Hispanic man. It was not busy for a Sunday dinner when the parking lot looked packed full.  Now for the service, I read the reviews prior to coming here but I wanted to give the place the benefit of the doubt. My family came here at 6pm however I did arrive 20 minutes after them, I texted my sister to get me water and she responded saying the waitress has not got to them. It was probably about 10 minutes after my arrival until she came to take our drink orders. I don't even want to know how long the group next to us (who came before my family did) was waiting, they didn't look too happy. Our waitress's name was Amy, there was two other teppanyaki shows going on but she wasn't the only waitress. After our chef came out and started serving us the fried rice we had so many soup and salad bowls still clustered around us my group pilled it up and set it at the end of our table, the group next to us had to get up and move their bowls to the empty hibachi grill table next to them since there was no room for them at the end of their table. Everyone's drink was also empty for while before she came around to get refills (this was the only time she came back around to check up on us). After the chef was done and we finished eating, everyone had to sit around for awhile before she came back to ask us if we're ready for the bill and needed boxes. I would say it took about 30 minutes after being done eating to get our bill and cards back before we left.  I don't want to give it a lower rating because maybe they're just always short on staff which does need fixing with so many complaints on here, but I do think the performance and the interior design is phenomenal. The food was great and I had a little bit of everything off the grill. Because of the service, I will be still on the look out for my new favorite hibachi spot but if I come here again I know to order two glasses of water instead of one.
