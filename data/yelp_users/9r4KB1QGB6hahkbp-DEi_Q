My sister and I headed to Coup Des Tartes to use her Groupon before it expired. She had been before and loved it, so I was excited to finally see what all the fuss was about!   First of all, I just want to throw out there that I don't at all understand the name of the restaurant. From what I can recall from European History, a coup is a military overthrow. So... we're trying to overthrow the tarts?   Anyways, I'm glad that we got here early, because even on a Wednesday, the place filled up pretty quickly. We were able to be seated right away despite not having a reservation, but that could be because we arrived about 10 minutes after it opened for dinner. There are not many tables inside, so it'd be pretty difficult if you had a large group, but the whole place has a very cozy feel. Unfortunately, there are probably less than a dozen parking spaces out front, so I'm not sure where you would park once those filled up.  The food came out pretty quickly, and my sister had the lamb shank ($24) while I had the salmon ($28). Her lamb shank came out on a bed of cous cous with assorted vegetables on the side. It was tasty, but a little on the salty side. My salmon came with spinach and basmati rice, topped with a green olive salsa and pesto on the side. I don't usually like green olives, but it went well with the fish, though the salmon was cooked a bit more than I would prefer. The rest of the dish was well seasoned, but the salsa was a bit salty. Both dishes came in pretty big portions, and went great with their housemade mint iced tea.   Even though we were pretty full already, we figured that we couldn't leave without having some dessert! We had the chocolate peanut butter tart, which was great, but way too rich after our entrees. It was more chocolatey than peanut-butter-y, and not too sweet. We each only took a few bites, but luckily we got a box to take it home, and it was every bit as good the next day.

How have I lived in Gilbert for 12 years and just recently discovered Bergie's?! To say that I've become obsessed is putting it pretty mildly.   Everyone is super friendly here and the coffee is top-notch. The caramel macchiato is pretty good, but I'm partial to the amazing white mocha. I appreciate that the workers are always patient and helpful, and a big plus is that they have a bunch of different kinds of milk -regular, nonfat, almond, soy, coconut, you name it!   I haven't been able to enjoy my coffee on the cute little patio yet, but I can't wait to do so when it finally starts to cool down again. I'll definitely be back at least a few more times before I have to leave for school again!

I've been here quite a few times, and this place is definitely one of my favorites in the Chandler/Gilbert area. It usually isn't too difficult to find parking, but you might have to circle around a few times on weekends as it is downtown Chandler. Anyone working is always incredibly friendly and won't hesitate to help out if you have trouble deciding which flavor to get -as I often do. Even when there are a lot of people here, as there often are on weekend nights, the line moves really quickly and there are a few tables for anyone who wants to hang out around the shop.   I've had the: -watermelon with mint (amazing! very refreshing and not too sweet) -peach with mint (probably one of my favorites that I've had there so far) -key lime (my sister's favorite, but i really just like the graham cracker crust on it) -lemon drop (i liked it a lot, but it was very very tart) -plain pineapple (also very refreshing, it was more or less just like eating a frozen pineapple spear) -blackberry lavender (a popular flavor, but I didn't particularly like it because i couldn't really taste the lavender) -orange vanilla cream (definitely one of my favorites, i like that it's vanilla with a separate layer of orange on top) -bananas foster (it was a little too sweet for me, but my sister likes this one)  I especially like that their menu changes almost daily so that there's always a new flavor to try, and they even have paletas for dogs! I'll definitely be back!

On a Wednesday afternoon, the line stretched from the counter to the front door; that's gotta be a sign that this place is good, right? Because there was only one girl working, the line moved pretty slowly, and she informed a customer who asked that it's usually busy like this once school starts up again. Even despite being swamped and clearly tired, the barista was super friendly and was quick to get the drinks together.   The environment of this place is definitely unexpected based on all of the drab business-like buildings surrounding it -it is downtown Phoenix, after all. There's a nifty floor-to-ceiling mural of a tree covering one wall, and the rest are adorned with a variety of other artworks. There are a ton of things to look at, which makes for a cool environment if you're looking for a place to hang out for a while. And if that isn't enough, Billy Joel's Piano Man came on as soon as I sat down and started getting ready to enjoy my treats! Who doesn't love some Billy Joel??   I had the cafe caramel, which was pretty good but as a forewarning came unsweetened. My sister had an iced toddy, which she enjoyed a lot. I like the sizes of their drinks; you actually get your money's worth, unlike Starbucks where you're more or less paying your organs' value on the black market for a coffee the size of a Dixie cup. Not to be dramatic or anything.   We also shared a cannoli and a peanut butter cup cookie. I would definitely pass on the cannoli next time. I liked the taste of it, but the texture of the filling was awkward. I don't know if it was just from sitting in the display case all day, but the filling was very much chewable and the shell(?) was starting to get a little stale. The peanut butter cup cookie, on the other hand, was wonderful! For starters, it's about the size of your face. It was also baked to perfection, as I prefer chewy cookies to crunchy ones. It was just a smidgen too sweet, but was great when paired with the coffee.   I would probably come here more often if I didn't live so far away, but I'll definitely be back if I'm ever in this area again!

My only wish is that Dutch Bros was closer to me! I've heard some mediocre things about the locations in Tempe, but I've only ever been to this location, and I've never been disappointed. The staff is always helpful, friendly, and amazingly energetic.   The drive thru usually moves pretty quickly; when the line is long, they'll have someone run out and take your order beforehand so that your drink is all ready to go by the time you reach the window. If for any reason there are people going through before you that are taking a while or your drink is taking a little longer to be made, someone working will usually hang out by the window and chat. I had to wait for maybe 2 minutes one time, and the worker gave me 9 extra stamps -for the record, that's only one drink away from a free one!   I'm in love with the white mocha and the annihilator, but the caramelizer and chai are pretty good as well. I also hear great things about the double chocolate mocha and their lemonade, I'll have to try those sometime. In my opinion, it's a little bit on the pricey side ($4.25 for a medium) but definitely well worth it.   I can't thank my roommate enough for introducing me to Dutch Bros! Unfortunately, my wallet doesn't feel the same way.

The Brickyard has very quickly become one of my favorite places in the East Valley.   There are not a lot of places that I trust to make a solid old fashioned, but the bartenders here knock it out of the park every damn time. I've had sips of other drinks and all have been excellent, particularly the Pimm's Cup, but seriously, if you've ever in your life been vaguely interested in an old fashioned, get one here. I literally close my eyes and sigh in contentment with every first sip of one. If cocktails aren't your jam, don't fret. Their whiskey selection would make any casual (or not-so-casual) alcoholic misty eyed with joy.  I've had a lot of their dishes, but I think their menu is changing soon (if it hasn't already). Not sure what'll be added or kept, but I have a good amount of trust in their kitchen to keep on rockin' every dish they put out. I'm a big fan of charcuterie boards across the board (heh) but theirs in particular is pretty great. I appreciate hat the servers always take the time to explain in detail each piece of the board. I'd also recommend the street tacos (because street tacos always) and the fingerling potatoes (because if you don't love potatoes, you're wrong).   The service is always stellar here. Everyone is warm and inviting as soon as you walk in, and despite only having been in a handful of times, they recognize me and take the time to make some small talk. All the servers are great about knowing the menu inside and out, and never hesitate to make recommendations when asked.   The environment is pretty cool too. A little dark, but pretty much what you'd expect from a place with exceptional cocktails and an amazing whiskey selection. They've done a lot with a somewhat awkwardly shaped space--it goes surprisingly far back, but is a pretty narrow place. They've got a patio in the back with extra tables that's really nice when weather permits, and even has a fire place for when it's chilly in the winter.   I've recommended this place to tons of people, and wouldn't hesitate to keep doing so. Downtown Chandler can be a little rough to find parking on weekends, but Brickyard is well worth the effort!

So here's the thing: my coworkers and I came during the lunch rush, we were a pretty sizable party, and this place is just getting off of the ground--all things I kept reminding myself during our experience here. That being said, places don't really hang around for long in this area if they can't figure out how to do lunch quickly and well.  Being immediately greeted by the ordering counter upon walking in is a little overwhelming. I felt pressured to make a decision immediately, as the line can hold probably 8 people before it's right out the door and into the scorching heat. The "build your own" section was a bit confusing to me, as there was no elaboration as to how many things you choose for a plate. However, a staff member was over fairly quickly to explain how everything worked, and even to give a couple recommendations, which I always appreciate. Seeing as they had just opened, they weren't offering their full menu yet--completely understandable, but guests should be made more aware of that upon entry/being greeted rather than being told at the register.   The food is stellar, that much can't be denied. I built my own meal, choosing the roasted broccolini ($3), farro mac and cheese ($3), and grass-fed steak ($5). The steak was cooked to medium-rare perfection, though they never asked how I wanted it done, so this might be a problem for others who like theirs well-done. The farro mac and cheese surpassed all of my expectations, with some of the best cheese sauce I've had in recent memory. However, the name can be somewhat misleading, as farro serves as the "mac" in this dish. The broccolini was topped with red pepper and Parmesan and also surpassed my expectations. My only issue with the food here was the quantity. I'm a small person, it definitely doesn't take much to fill me up, but even I was left looking for something more to munch on after my meal. It's hard not to be slightly irritated to pay $3 for approximately 2.5 stalks of broccolini, regardless of how tasty it is.   As I mentioned, we had a big group dining here and it's a fast casual place, so we had pretty realistic expectations that we wouldn't all be served our food at the exact same time. But there's a bit of an issue when the first person doesn't receive their meal until probably 40 minutes after sitting down, and the last half dozen are so fed up with waiting over an hour after that, that they request their food to just be boxed up so they could take it back to the office and eat. The manager did come out and apologize, promising refunds for those few which was appreciated. Pro tip: you can't market yourself as a fast casual restaurant if you're not fast.  The other big issue we faced was with the service. Again, I tried to keep in mind that they were a brand new restaurant and everyone was still trying to figure things out. But it's hard for a girl to remain understanding when the misters on the patio are essentially a monsoon storm in and of themselves. We were sitting on the patio, having moved a few tables together to fit all of us in, and there were probably 6-7 misters pointing at only our table. We noticed right when we sat down that they seemed to be on pretty strong, but underestimated how soaked everything would get. We asked an employee after a few minutes of it would be possible to turn them down, and he agreed to speak to someone about it. Upon his return, he said that due to a "technical error," there was nothing he could do about them. So in response, we explained that since we were the only table these were affecting, would it be possible to just have them shut off? I felt bad for the guy, really I did, but the look of exasperation on his face seemed unnecessary before he muttered a vague apology, repeated the technical error line, and said he'd see what he could do. I mean, all of our hair was drenched and matted to our faces, it was soaking the dishes that had arrived by then, and there were literal puddles of water on the tables. He returned and repeated the same line. A coworker went to speak to someone else about it, and had the misters shut off maybe 10 minutes later.   I love the farm to table concept, and the environment and brand that they've built is really great at capturing that idea. But it strikes me as odd that they'd choose to open right next to the Original ChopShop, which is an already well-established brand successfully executing the same general idea. For the quality of the food alone, I hope this place can quickly work out its kinks, but I'm not gonna hold my breath on that one. Until I hear someone I trust tell me that they had the best dining experience of their entire lives here, I likely won't be back.
