I had been looking for a bike for weeks.  I wish I would have just started here!  They're extremely helpful and want to help you find the right bike for you.  Troll is the man!  He got me into exactly what I was looking for quickly and easily.  I am THRILLED with the after the sale service as well.  I can't recommend Chester's strongly enough!!!

They didn't check us in until almost an hour past check in time. We were exhausted and waiting the lobby for them to tell us when a room became available as they said they would. Then they started checking in people who arrived after us. I made online reservations through a travel site. They asked me what type of room I requested. I told them non-smoking, 2 queen beds. They specifically asked me how many beds, I confirmed two. They finally give us our room key & there is only one bed when we get to the room. Went back down to the lobby and was told that's what I requested. Let them know that is NOT what I requested. They said that's what I booked online. So I asked them if they knew that's what I had supposedly booked why would they ask me how many beds. They said it doesn't matter if they ask me, I only booked one bed. Verified with the online seller that I requested two beds. They said too bad, they're sold out so there's nothing they can do. No offer for any sort of solution or compensation, their attitude is tough luck. Probably gave the room I booked to some of the people who showed up after me. Rude and inconsiderate staff, I will definitely never stay here again.

This is the worst meal I've ever had at a restaurant and it cost a small fortune. We went for my son's birthday because we love shrimp and we love Forrest Gump and have always wanted to try it here. The fried shrimp tasted funny. I ate one and didn't like it at all but figured I'm paying for it. So I tried to eat a second one but gave up, so they were wasted. We ordered dessert because I was so disappointed with the meal I figured at least the cookie sundae would be nice. Nope. The cookie was completely over baked and super dried out. Everywhere else I've had one serves it kind of gooey and delicious but this one was awful. What a let down to have bad shrimp at a shrimp place!  Also, the "garlic bread" didn't taste much like garlic. More like buttered bread. You'd think when the waitress took away my plate & saw all the shrimp still on it, she would have asked if something was wrong but she didn't. So I told her the shrimp wasn't good and she just said sorry and walked off. Didn't offer to do anything to satisfy us or correct the situation. I will NEVER go back. $65 down the drain.  (Also having some serious intestinal issues today. Gee, I wonder if that has anything to do with bad shrimp???)

Ashlee cares about her clients and will go the extra mile to make sure they are taken care of. I would recommend her to anyone who needs insurance. It is so nice to have a local agent you can depend on, instead of just a call center where the people don't know you and you never know who you're going to get!  Ashlee will be a great agent for you!

I had been told these guys are like the In-n-Out of hot dogs. And the hot dogs are good. Everything else sucks, especially the service. The burgers are mediocre at best, the chicken is terrible. And if they make a mistake on your order, they will NOT rectify it. They'll promise you they'll mail you a gift card, but it will never show up. When you check on the status, they'll tell you they'll look into it, but again, thy won't. Save yourself some money and get better food and service at In-n-Out.

Please don't do business here.  These guys are absolute scumbag liars and they will absolutely rip you off.  They say they are owned by a good Christian family who like to help people, but the manager is definitely not a good Christian guy.  He can't even tell a story the same way twice.  Every word out of his mouth is a lie.  Very high pressure tactics, they will send you on your merry way with a car, then three weeks later try to double the payment you agreed to, then try to get you to switch to a much crappier car than you originally agreed to, withhold your own car from you, and basically try to bully you into buying from them.  Worst experience ever.  Do NOT trust them.  They take absolute advantage of poor people and will try to steal your money.
