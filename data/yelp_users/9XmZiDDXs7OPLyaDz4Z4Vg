one of the reasons I like credit unions is most of them have shared banking. Well I found out the hard way that this one branch does not do shared banking

Wow , well done panda express all the reviews said that this location was the worst in the valley. Unfortunately for me, I was freaking hungry had not eaten anything all day long. I figured I would still give it a try even if it has a terrible review. I arrive at  8:12 just to read the  sign posted in on the door we will close at 8:00 today. So I go on the website it still says 9:00 yelp says 9:00 so unless you are here there is no way of knowing this information.

I visited this panda at around 1:30 on a Monday.  I will have to say that I found it to be the second worse one I have visited in the valley. The service was unfriendly and the food was not what I have come to expect from panda express. The orange chicken in my opinion had been there for a while longer than it should have been. It was tough and tasted  old

I must have a desire to be punished and tormented. I had a great feeling from my last experience at this panda that I should not stop in.  But when you want the orange chicken you just want some orange chicken. Unfortunately what I got was not fresh orange chicken.

I was very disappointed with the service as well as the food today. I have been a couple of times before and I have never had a complaint about the place. But today the service was pitiful. I am hoping that it was just an off day and not the way things are going to be in the future. I will give it one more chance just cause I have had such good food in the past.

cool place drop your car off take there shuttle over to the airport, or just walk out and jump on the light rail. sometimes I use it just so I do not have one of those "Dude where is my car mornings"  or if you want to hide your ride from a crazy ex or the repossession man.

Not impressed at all typical small gun shop. Lady was more interested in talking with someone about political talk radio than taking to the gun store customer. Her business card for the talk radio was on the counter every three or four feet. It was apparent that that was the most important thing there not guns

I have been stopping in at Sportsman's Fine Wine & Spirits for a couple of years now. The price range of wine was extreme, they had wine that ranged from @ $10.00 a bottle to bottles that cost in my opinion an insane amount not to say they are not worth the insane price it is just the price was insane. But sadly the reason I have given just one star is the store is closed down  yep that is right no longer in business.

I acutely came here the first time cause I was in the area and looking for a new place to eat since the McDon down the street was closed. I found this place it had all good reviews except for one, that one was s new account with no friends and only one review. I figured it had to be a false hateful review but there was only one way to find out and that is to try it out. I am so glad I did food is great you know for a burger place.

I found the carne asada not to have much flavor and the cheese was not even Mexican cheese, it was plain old shredded American cheese. The cheese was just partly melted. Place was very clean that is one good thing that I can say about the place and the prices were reasonable. But really does that matter if the food was not that good?

This lane Bryant is a hit or a mis. I have been buying things for my wife here for years, some days I go in the ladies are very helpful but most of the time they are totally rude especially if it is a skinny girl.  Lane Bryant has opened a new location over at Tanger Outlet Mall the ladies that work there are all ways friendly. So friendly they even went so far as to model a dress for me.
