I was a little worried about the menu at first but the great staff broke everything down and showed that the food is the star of the show and not the menu.    I was very excited to see new and exciting ingredients on a scottsdale menu and have become a fan of the relaxed culture of the restaurant and the food being served.  I enjoyed some really cool beers, amazing fries, and I think the best steak sandwhich this side of Philly.  Everything about the restaurant is fresh, exciting, and new to me and I can't wait to go back and try some of the other inspired dishes on the menu.  It is my understanding that the trout and rabbit are must haves and i will in the near future.  Please feel free to use this as a suggestion and try new fare in a hip but relaxed atmosphere with great drinks, fantastic grub, and a chance to expand your culinary palate.  Cheers, SW

I am a huge fan of the meats...they are all delicious and tasty and the spicy sauce kicks me in my mouth in the best way possible.  I have been there 3 times in the last 6 weeks and it will continue to be in my favorite rotation.  The sides are different and don't blow my hair-back but I say keep it simple because the fries are on point and nothing goes better with great bbq than fries.  Keep it simple and keppin on point.  I will see you with my bib tied on tight soon.

My gf and I wanted a nice and relaxing lunch and thought about doing some shopping and dining at the quarter in Scottsdale. We ended up here at tru foods and really liked the setting and had lunch on the patio and that was the highlight.  The meal was slow to arrive, service was slow, and the food was boring. I think the staff had to many of their famous elixir drinks that lulled the whole place into a catatonic state with no personality and it came across in the food.  Sam Fox let me down on this visit and with all the other options in his new neighborhood there is nothing that is going to pull me back into his joyless world of Tru Food Kitchen.

I had an hour to kill and thought I would grab a bite and wish I would have saved the caloric intake for something else,  the pizza was really greasy and soggy with a very plain and basic crust.  There was no flavor or tender crunch that I recognize with their style of pie, I'm hoping this was an off day as it is a new location but they need to work on it quick.
