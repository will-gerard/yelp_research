I have been looking for a Pork Pie hat so I can be Heisenberg from the popular "Breaking  Bad" series for Halloween. I usually like to shop on line but thought it best to try a hat on before buying it. A quick call verified that Heritage Hats had what I was looking for in stock, Pork Pie hats are almost impossible to find because of the series and  Halloween. The owner, Rich, said he would put the hat aside for me and off I went.   The giant "HATS" sign on the west side of Cave Creek Rd. is impossible to miss. When I walked in I was completely blown away by the sheer number, variety and styles of hats they carry. I'm not a hat person per se but I found the selection irresistible. Rich is also very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful and I ended up walking out with another hat in addition to the one I originally intended to purchase. I will be back for more!

I'm an avid foodie, I love to cook and I'm pretty handy in the kitchen having been raised in a large Italian family and worked in several restaurants. And whether it's woodworking or cooking I've always felt that good tools save time and money in the long run. I've always been a stainless steel and cast iron kind of guy but figured one good non-stick skillet would be a useful addition for omelettes and other sticky dishes cooked without added fat.  Tyler was extremely friendly and knowledgeable and pointed out the pros and cons of the various brands and non-stick surfaces available. I wanted something that would be durable, oven safe and not leach any toxic chemicals into the food. I had been considering All-Clad, whose stainless cookware I adore, but had some doubts about their non-stick cookware, which he confirmed. After presenting several alternatives to consider I decided that Scanpan fit the bill perfectly. A two skillet set, 8" and 10", was specially priced and had 20% off on top of that. Checkout was just as easy and friendly and the pans perform wonderfully. I will definitely be back for more kitchen goodies.

This was my second visit to Humble Pie and my first to the Desert Ridge location. Both times were excellent. On this most recent trip I had the lunch special, a personal sized pizza and a choice of soup or a half salad. I had the Steak & Turkey chili which was a bit too vinegary for my taste but the pizza was excellent. I opted for the Schreiner's Sicilian Sausage pizza; the taste, texture, thin crust, everything about it was exquisite. There is a nice selection of white and red pies and though it's a bit pricier than your average pizza, this is a couple of notches above average pizza. Well worth it!

Team Clean and Haul was recommended to me by a contractor with whom I have frequently worked. I needed a dumpster on short notice. I called in the morning and it was delivered that afternoon. The placement needed to be precise due to property line issues and it was perfect on the first try. The phone staff was very friendly as was the driver and more than once I was told how much my business was appreciated. Very good bunch.

I hired Sonoran Peak to renovate my kitchen and turn the living room/dining room into a home theater. The work included cutting through the slab to move a gas line and downdraft vent, removing a sliding glass door to widen a header and install French doors, adding a wall to enclose the home theater, building soffits, adding 3 dedicated 20 amp circuits in the theater and a 220V line in the garage and reinforcing the ceiling to hold the projector, among other things. I also added an HVAC vent in the theater and two more returns.  Some of the planning was done by an acoustician and required a lot of precision and attention to detail as well as some unusual methods and materials.   Sonoran Peak did a great job and worked closely with me to get just the result I was looking for. They have a solid knowledge of structural as well as fine carpentry, were neat and clean and showed up on time every day. The company principals were there a few times a week making sure everything was going according to plan. Very happy with the work.

I first joined in 1999 and have been a member ever since. I joined when I first built my house and used the club extensively to furnish and finish my home saving a lot of money in the process. After that I used it only occasionally but still found it worthwhile as I could buy my mother pieces of Le Creuset cookware for substantially less than I could find it even at the best sale prices. You can also find high quality knives, luggage, massage chairs and a lot more. The club is geared more towards high end, high quality goods, though not exclusively, so if that's not your thing, this may not be for you.   I'm now in the middle of remodeling my home and have once again saved a lot of money on furniture, lighting, window coverings and tile. I have been working with an interior designer who can buy most building materials and furniture at wholesale. For some items it was better to go through her resources but for most, we were able to get exactly what we wanted and the best deals through Direct Buy.   The showroom is beautiful and well laid out. Ordering is a bit more time consuming than walking into a store and picking out what you want. You need to provide item numbers, shipping weights, specify finishes, etc. but the staff is friendly and more than willing to help you out and the catalogs contain all of the information you need. It's not difficult by any stretch of the imagine, it's just a bit more time consuming and quite possibly heavenly for the detail oriented, OCD types. Allow yourself plenty of time to peruse the vast selection of items and options and it's a cakewalk.   Online ordering is also quite easy. I ordered my lighting last Thursday, expecting it to arrive in about a month (it ships direct from the manufacturer). It arrived on Saturday, much to my surprise.   Bottom line, if you are building or furnishing a home or doing a remodel with high quality materials and furnishings then it's a worthwhile investment. If you want Ikea quality at Ikea prices, then Ikea is a better bet. Just plan on replacing it all in a few years. And for anyone who considers this ultra high end, please visit Christian Liaigre or Clive Christian.

After double checking the website to make sure they were open until 9PM I purchased a Yelp deal to eat at Rotana. I called at 8:20 to place an order to be picked up and was told that the kitchen was closed. I responded that their web site said they were open until 9PM. The man responded that they were tired and wanted to go home. I hung up a little dismayed at the lack of customer service.   I called right back and asked to speak to a manager. A woman got on the phone and said she would get the manager. She returned about a minute later and  informed me that the manager had gone home. I told her what had happened and she said the kitchen closed at 8:30. I said, it's 8:23! It was 8:20 when I called the first time. Get your story straight people.  I guess I'm going another time because, well I bought the coupon. Hopefully the in house service is better than over the phone . . . sheesh.  P.S. - Yelp offered to refund my voucher and after reading all the issues others have had with service I decided to accept it.
