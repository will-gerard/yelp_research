Horrible customer service,  vehicle rented stunk of cigarette smoke.  No apology, just reassigned a downgraded car after another 30 min wait  Do not use A V I S

Horrible customer service,  vehicle rented stunk of cigarette smoke.  No apology, just reassigned a downgraded car.    With the competition next door, I expected better service.

Two thumbs up on food, service and ambience.  Pricing was a bit stiff for what you got but other than that almost 5 stars.  This is a place you could come and hang out for hours not just stop by and grab a bite to eat

Very attractive female help staff is always a plus.  All of the staff was surprisingly very friendly.    Fair prices and top notch ambience  As far as a country bar not so much, more like pop country hip hop.  Men should not wear man scarves and skinny jeans. Enough said
