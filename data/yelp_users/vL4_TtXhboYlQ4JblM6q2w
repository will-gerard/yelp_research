I wish I could give this place more than 1 star, everyone constantly recommending this place so I finally went with a co worker for dinner and ordered a rainbow roll and a salmon dynamite roll and seemed ok, nothing to rave about but portions were big and service was good. Well 5 hours later my my coworker and I had food poisoning. And so did her boyfriend who ate the leftovers.  Been sick for about 12 hours... Never going there again. Beware is all I have left to say.

I made a last minute appointment on Friday and they were able to squeeze me in thankfully. I typically go to European wax but decided to give this a try from the great reviews on here. I was helped by Jennifer the owner and she did such a wonderful job. She was careful, detailed and made sure I was super comfortable. This place was great looking and very clean. I have found my permanent waxing place. I recommend this place to all! Jennifer is amazing and I'm very glad I came!
