LuTLXVyJvgshMlXTBw-Now
My wife and I came in tonight. We asked to be reseated to another booth so we could have more room for our 7 month old. The next thing we know, the "hostess" a 6'3" 65 year old Yak named "Tracy" was mean mugging both my wife and I.  We wrote it off like maybe she was having a bad day...however, each time this beast walked past our table she would give us a nasty death scowl as though we had intruded upon her territory and had challenged her to a dual. I hardly ever write yelp reviews however this encounter with Tracy the Outback Beast had to be accounted for.   Note- The waiter Jeff was awesome and was very accommodating.
