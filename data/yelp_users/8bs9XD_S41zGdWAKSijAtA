Who cares what they put on it-that bread is amazing! It's fresh baked and chewy and delicious. The mozzarella sandwich is delicious too. Somehow the tomatoes are ripe and fresh year round. I love the little caramels they throw in with every order, as well.   What I don't like is that it's a little pricey for what you get. I understand the complaints that there's nowhere to sit and very little beverage options, but it's set up to be a takeout place. It's a decent trade-off.   I haven't ventured over to the pizza place yet, as I can't fathom any meal worth waiting over 3 hours for. The quality of this place, though, makes me believe that it's gotta be pretty tasty.

I'm somewhat of a bike junky, and after stopping by a few other shops in Central Phoenix to check them out, I was sorely disappointed by the selection. Then I popped into Slippery Pig. I loved the selection, the variety, and the level of interest in what I wanted. I wasn't even planning on buying a bike and told the guy that. He didn't seem to care and showed me around anyway.  I've since gotten a few accessories there and have been pleased by the staff's suggestions and service. Maybe there's some mystery d-bag roaming around there, judging from some of the lousy reviews, but I've never had anything but exemplary service.  I'll reserve a fifth star for when I either buy a bike or get some more substantial service here. In the meantime, Slippery Pig will remain my LBS.

I don't want to shop for sex toys in A. lights so bright that it makes everything and everyone washed out and pasty, B. a place where the quality of the products is questionable at best, C. where inevitably, a creep will follow me and my girlfriend around, trying to see what we're looking at. Why does Phoenix not have better sex toy stores??

This place rules. If you're looking for high-end, low-end, fancy, mundane, obscure, or whatever you need for your sweet treats, it's here. I guarantee it. The staff are helpful, too. I get lost here in the very best way.

As a woman who knows a bit about cars, I am usually instantly in defense mode when I bring my car to a new mechanic. I was bringing my car in for some standard maintenance and brakes. Bill at the front, however was nice, professional, and gave me a straightforward explanation of what they were going to do. The other Bill called just a few hours later with a complete breakdown of what they saw and what needed to be done. He even talked me out of something that I thought I needed but really didn't! Later that afternoon, their polite driver/mechanic picked me up at my house. The total was exactly as quoted earlier, and Bill #1 gave me some valuable advice about future maintenance.  Great mechanics who don't try to rip you off are rare, as most of us know. This shop deserves every star it has gotten. Customer for life.

Unapologetic vegan comfort food. Just plain yum! Sandwiches, Bowls, Soy-namis, I haven't tried a dud yet. Everyone who works there is incredibly friendly as well.  I frequently find myself daydreaming about this place.

New Phoenix location is even better than the Tempe location!

There aren't many places where you can get a pot of loose-leaf tea all to yourself. There also aren't many places that make their own (delicious!) chai. The baked goods are tasty, the coffee is roasted on-sight and has an irresistible aroma that permeates the whole place. One of the best things is that it's next to Pane Bianco, too!  Only 4 stars because the staff are often too cool for school, and often too cool to give a crap about good service.

We were lucky and hit Cibo on the night Phoenix was supposed to get a tornado. We were only one of 4 tables in the place, and the service was fantastic, But again, there was no excuse for it not to be.  The pizza was some of the best I've had out of New York. I absolutely loved the crust. The salad was fresh and well dressed. The wine list was also really decent.  I'll consider giving it a fifth star if when I go back, the service and quality hold up.

I rode self-taught for a number of years without an endorsement. Yeah, I know. How stupid can you get? I bought a new bike and finally wised up and decided to do it right this time. I enrolled for the course and can't believe how much I learned! The instructors took every piece of the course and broke it down into really easily digestible chunks. They were more than accommodating to a number of skill levels, too. I un-learned a lot of bad habits, as well. I feel like I have a much healthier respect for riding, as well as a much better skill set to keep me safer out there.  Kevin was my instructor, and he made the whole course that much more fun and informative.

Great cut. I recently moved to Phoenix and have been looking for the right salon. It's hard as we all know! Called up and got an appointment the next day. Jorge listened to exactly what I wanted and gave me the perfect cut and style. Only 4 stars because I'll need to go back to make sure they're consistent. But definitely going back!  Went back. Better cut than the first time. Customer for life!

Wow! Coming from back East, I'm usually disappointed with Italian food in Arizona. This place, however was just spot on. The service was warm, friendly, professional, and prompt. My picky girlfriend wanted her pasta dish modified in several ways and our server bent over backwards to get her exactly what she wanted, with no hint of an eye roll. So many places in Phoenix just don't have this professional level of service and focus way more on the "cool points". The owner or exec chef, or whomever that big guy is who talks to everyone was charming and funny.  The food was fantastic, and that spicy oil was a great way to start our meal. I don't even remember what I had, other than that it was a meatless pasta dish and that I couldn't stop eating it!  What a nice place for a good, solid meal and/or a really nice date.

What took me so long to give it 5 stars?? Aiello's is now my go-to place for dates and visiting family. They're always wowed!

The wine list is great, the bruschetta are delicious, and the desserts are...well I never order dessert but I couldn't resist. I can't wait to go back.

I'm taking away a star. Boo!  I heard a rumor that the ownership of Postino has changed hands. Whether this is true or not, I have noticed a significant change in the quality of service. Not 1, not 2, but 3 visits in a row, when I ordered the same dish, they completely screwed up my order and left me waiting for over 30 minutes. It was only the last time that they took care of it on the check.  I still love the food, the wine is great, and the atmosphere is swanky. I am less anxious to bring friends and family there now, though.

I ordered a simple dish with egg noodles, mixed veggies, and tofu. It smelled overwhelmingly of feet. No kidding. Stinky-ass feet. Couldn't eat it. No thanks.

Another Fox restaurant...yawn.    We started out on a bad note when we took a seat at the bar to wait for our table. The bar was really cool looking and we loved the idea of using green apples as paperweights. The selection of wine and beer was really decent for a place with a limited menu. The bartender, however, poured us pathetically small glasses of wine. It would have been ok if it appeared to be consistent, but we saw several glasses going out to tables that were much fuller. They weren't exorbitantly priced glasses, but I still want what I'm paying for!   Next, the food. The zucchini fries were bland and fell apart, but the sauce that they came with was pretty tasty. The truffle fries were lacking in a good truffle flavor. Some of the fries in the basket were soggy and some were burnt. We sent most of them back. The veggie burger was super good. Just about one of the best veggie burgers I've ever tasted, surprisingly. The report from the ahi burger was "ok". The report from the Zinburger was "ok and undercooked according to my order". The sweet potato fries were delicious.    The service was good. Elizabeth busted her butt to get us everything we needed, despite the clear lack of organization in the rest of the restaurant: The place had cleared out considerably by the time we ordered, and it still took about 30 minutes to get our food!   As with most Fox Concepts, it's all concept and no substance. From most of the other reviews, I don't expect a long wait for tables in this place the very near future.

I'm really happy about the new location and the expanded hours. The patio is a plus. The quality, tastiness, and friendly service is still the same. I love that they will substitute grilled tofu for any meat. I also love the sides.  That's a Wrap is nothing insanely original or delicious. It's just really good and consistent.
