Their happy hour is amazing. Their staff is pretty friendly and helpful. The last time I was in we had a huge group and they did a pretty good job of taking care of us. It's no easy feat when we didn't stop talking almost the entire time.

Who doesn't breakfast available on Saturday mornings? Apparently this place. Try to grab breakfast on my way to work this morning. I went to the drive through and another couple parked, an employee was outside told the couple that they weren't open yet. I happen to overhear since he didn't bother to come and tell me. Just FYI people work on Saturday too and they want breakfast.

Love the food. I eat here about once a week and I almost always get something different. taco Tuesdays are crazy busy, but if you go a little later it has calmed down. I especially love the "Trainer Salad" with chicken. I will say that sometimes the food isn't consistent from one time to the next even if you order the exact same thing. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just means that it is made fresh and they are humans. However, they can occasionally mess up your order, but will fix it for you no problem. I love that it is family owned and the staff is friendly. Can't wait to go again... next week.

This morning I was in for what I thought was a nail in my tire. Turns out I had a hole and the other tire needed to be replaced as well. Cory was a life saver. He was compassionate and understanding and helped me find a solution. It was an extremely humbling experience. I will never go anywhere else for tires after my experience today. And it wasn't even the first time I have had wonderful experiences with them this one just happens to take the cake.
