Misleading website and false advertising.  Bait and switch used to get me to call then price much more than ad price.  I would not send my ipod to a company that dosen't stand behind advertising or website pricing.  Must be a kid working in his basement, reputable companies stand behind what they represented.

Lots of great modern Italian dishes, great service and a cool atmosphere.  Nice date place for a fun night a little off the beaten path but still close enough to Scottsdale nightlife to walk.  I had drinks and dinner.  Bartender suggested wines for us and let us try some to decide what we wanted.  Band that played after dinner and was really good.  Was there on a Sunday night.  I think they have entertainment Fri, Sat and Sun after dinnertime.

Limited menu, poor service, poor service....did I say poor service?  Could not beg a waitress for help on Sunday afternoon, they were about 3/4 full, not packed by any means.  Finally got someone to bring me a drink after about 30 mins.  Lots of empty tables for the 90 mins we were there but they were all "reserved".  No one actually ever sat in those seats, when we left the place was pretty empty.  Accidentally ran my card for $250 and my actual $20 bill.  Could not get anyone on the phone today for help.  Been calling all day.  Regardless, when a place is run this poorly on the front end, no way its being run well behind the scenes.  Food selection was plain, no signature dish to come here for.  My burger and pretzels were average for bar food.  You wanna watch a game or have a nice evening out, plenty of better places in old-town.
