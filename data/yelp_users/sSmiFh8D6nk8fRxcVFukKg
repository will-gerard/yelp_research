Well, I don't write reviews very often but had an experience with California Pools that I thought worthy of a few words.  First of all, California Pools designed and installed our pool and really our entire backyard almost two years ago.  The experience was unexpectedly easy and refreshing.  We started by having Jeremy Smith to our home where we walked the backyard, talked about the ways my wife and I like to entertain as well as our budget.  With those basics in place, the process took off.  We were presented with multiple creative options, all with our interests and goals in mind.  Once we settled on a final plan, we were on cruise control.  We met with our designated pool contractor who gave us his personal cell phone number and a schedule.  I was thrilled to find that not only to did they stick to their estimated build schedule, they actually finished early and on budget.    The real reason for my review however has been the aftercare.  As you might imagine, once our project was complete, I thought it might be difficult to get them back out when we had a issue.  Sooo happy to be wrong about this.  After installation, we began have Pool Valet maintain our pool.  They apparently have a close working relationship with California Pools.  It was actually our Pool Valet guy that noticed a problem with our salt cell recently.  After trouble shooting the problem and trying to correct it, they contacted California Pools for us.  Boom.  48 hours later, our salt cell and another piece of equipment are replaced under warranty without any action or work on our part.  We received an informational phone call and email from California Pools notifying us that they would be on the property for a repair and that was it.  Problem (that we might still be unaware of) solved.  This is now almost 2 years after the install! Can't say enough about the initial build process and now aftercare.  California Pools has far exceeded my expectations on  both counts and with lots of choices in the pool industry to choose from, so glad I chose them.

Saturday night out with the whole gang (five) is not always easy.  Decided to try old town. We were greeted by friendly faces and seated promptly despite the place looking full. Our server was all over it.  My wife and I were sipping drinks and the kids had their drinks within minutes. Food was great. We left happy with full bellies.   Easy dining experience   Definitely on the regular rotation.

This is so sad. Sitting at Rula bula for the last time. Been coming here a couple times a month for a couple years. We love this place. But not after today.  The service is so horrendous. Out waitress is so angry. We asked her to correct an error to the order and she got so put off like it was somehow our fault.

So to celebrate Cinco de Mayo last night my wife and I were eager for a margarita. We decided would try Barrio Queen. We had been there before late at night and really liked it. We bring the kids, 14, 10, and 5. Okay that's a little risky but it's not a quiet place and my kids are pretty well behaved and they want to celebrate too. So it was an unusually perfect night out out and as we walked up at 6 pm there were lots of spots on the patio. We asked for a patio seat and we're told 30-45 minutes. Kind of a surprise but okay. So after 1:15 we are still waiting as party after party arrive well after us and fill up the patio. We finally said we would sit anywhere and eventually get seated at an indoor table. We get one of those tables down the main aisle with a booth bench on one side and chairs on the other. Not perfect for a family but whatever. Just got worse after that. Can't find our server, then can't get our drinks. Takes another 20 minutes just to finally get a margarita. Finally order. The food comes in bursts with some of us finished eating before other food arrives. Our table side guacamole appetizer gets served after we are all done eating our entrees. It was bizarre. Seemed deliberately kid UNFRIENDLY. Worst service I have had out in over 10 years and we eat out frequently.  To give you an idea, I have never written a negative review until now.  What a bummer.

The beer selection is amazing.  That said, worst service I've ever had ever. The wait staff was actually rude.  For the first time in my life we actually cancelled the order and left.  Never again.  Btw don't try to move a stool 3 ft left. You'll be attacked by the gestapo.
