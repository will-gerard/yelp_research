Eclectic, artsy, wine and cheese.  Not much to say, if you can find a spot to park...  You need to try.  Bruschetta is world famous! The home brew iced tea is wonderful!  Live music this Sunday, perfect Arizona weather, good company.  Just a great eating experience!

A great relief every Saturday. Sports Massage/deep tissue. Joe and Jordan are the top therapists. Both great.  I'm always sore from my workouts. These guys make it all better!  Each has a different style. Joe is direct pressure. Jordan is slow long holds.    I switch between. They are always booked, so try a couple weeks out to get the time you need.    Secret to booking a three hour session, since the desk can't do it...  Book a one hour then book a two hour session. Boom

Fun. Intimate. Great venue to get up close to the action.  We love this place. This time we are at the opening of the show "rumors."  Always a packed house when there are so few seats! Never worse than row four!  First class for everyone.

Our chef was from a mystical place called Guadalajara Tokyo. He was fun and performed the usually tricks including the Cho cho onion, the beating heart fried rice and of course, the flying shrimp!  A nice diversion to our routine.  We'll be back!

Avoid like the plague.  Tiny sandwich served on crunchy rye, not steamed. The bread was more like a cracker, not soft fresh bread.  The pastrami was served cold.  I guess I should have known better when the server asked if  I wanted lettuce on my pastrami.   The server was brand new and just did not know... Oh well I'm sure the bagels are ok.

We used to frequent our local KEG.  Guess we just forgot how nice it is!  We both enjoyed filet and they were as expected, perfectly prepared. The atmosphere and service is consistently 4 stars. This is a solid steak spot! The bar is well stocked. Herradura Repo flows freely which makes me very happy! We'll be back!

Culinary perfection. I could stop there...  The Feng shui is evident from the entry walk.  The architecture feels like we are part of something important. The view is one on the best available in the Phoenix valley. The water served is crystal clear in delicate stemware. Let's talk food! OMG BOOM POW WOW!  I delighted in my omelet ranchero. I've never experienced better. Unlike anything I have ever experienced. The daughter revelled in what was called eggs benedict but was a ridiculous combination of salivary explosions.  The wife went for miso salmon salad. The fish was perfectly prepared and matched with greens and spice.  What a treat! If you have never, you must. If you have, repeat over and over.

Some places never fail to deliver a dining experience. Lon's is an all time favorite. Dinner begins with drinks on the patio. Appetizers include crab cake and calamari. The "hermosa salad" bridges to our perfectly prepared filets. The mixed green veggies were the best of our side trio including Mac and cheese then beets.   Desert was heaven. When in Phoenix this is a must for an upscale night out.

As their reputation suggests...PERFECTION!  The steak, shrimp, scallops and bone in ribeye were prepared and presented in a manner to only dreamed about. Old time decor with wood and red velvet adorn the walls. Red leather buttoned booths finish the  ambiance. If you want the best and don't care about money, this is the place.

An island paradise in the desert! It's become our weekly getaway. You'll find us at our table by the bar. Every time we visit the service is always cool like a island breeze. The menu is island inspired.    It's always one step up from expected.  Coconut shrimp, chicken lollipops and artichoke begin the festivities along with mango iced tea. They have my favorite trio of Tequila's ready to pour! Never sure if in a silver, repo or anejo mood. Ask for Carl at the patio bar. Lunch today will be a chicken sandwich and I think the pineapple cake to finish. Just my favorite place to hang out!

Always our favorite! Great service, great food, and the best view!  Consistently outstanding. Authentic French cuisine. Our waiter, Max speaks French, even though he's from Romania. He made the evening. Scott the manager has been with the company since 2004. Nothing on the menu not worth trying. Get in early or wait an hour. Rarely a line at 5:00 for dinner.

Well two for two,  Nice service, exceptional bistro food.  Great day to enjoy outdoor dining in Scottsdale.  Salmon, prepared to perfection. Kobe burger with sautéed onions, crisp thick cut bacon and aged cheddar, YUMM. Caesar and grilled chicken, nice but the attention to detail in the croutons.  Well...You just gotta try em!  We'll be back!

Nothing better than a filet with his friend oscar on top. Well I guess if you place a couple tempura shrimp on the side...  And the best creamed spinach in the the whole world.  Hands down my favorite steak place.  Service, food and presentation.  The best!

So...  Tonight I had a fantastic sirloin. Now I know what you're thinking, OutBack is not a foodie kinda place. When it was tonight. I really like the house salad. It's simple, iceberg, an onion slice, cucumber and a tomato or two. The steamed broccoli was just as I like it. I added shrimp on the barbie. I enjoyed tequila on the cheep and the wife finally tied Tito's an tonic.   Service was spot on!  For a 3 star kinda place they earned a solid four stars tonight.  For someone who eats out 3x5 I was a happy camper!

Service as you would expect at the Ritz. Modern design like the Wynn. Great atmosphere like Bellagio.  What a surprise!  This is my new vegas fav! Small enough so you don't walk a mile to your room. Casino close, but not the focus. The hotel entry opens to a relaxing bar with all my top shelf favorites.  As you enter the hotel drive, quick bell and valet service. Check in and the bags were in our room as soon as we arrived.  Wow. Just a wonderful stay!

Refused to serve my 68 year old client a beer because he left his id at home.  Sometimes rules are kinda silly. We won't ever come back.  Silly since this is a nice place with good food. Servers are just filling rules from idiots I guess.

Amazing, incredible, awesome. WOW what a show. I had no idea how entertaining and talented (Terry Fator). His voice is fantastic. If you can sing with your mouth moving with his talent is rare. His comic wit and puppet friends are terrific. To sing with out moving his mouth is magic!  Worth every penny and then some. A Vegas Must See!

A treat! A perfect evening. The ambiance is from a movie. Imagine the most romantic candle lit courtyard from a storybook. Chef selection begins with three courses timed wonderfully. Each building upon the next in preparation for the entrée. Wine pairing is top of the vine. I selected chicken. We enjoyed filet and sea bass as well. The menu descriptions are perfect and a must read. I can't do it justice. All I can say is enjoy the perfect dining experience. 5 stars plus! I can't wait to visit again!

Nothing special...  We didn't try the pizza, which is the attraction.  We had minestrone soup to start. Cubed fresh veggies and a nice broth. Spaghetti and meatballs, pistachio crusted sea bass, and I requested a special plate of meatballs coated in mozzarella and marinara round out the service.  The fish was very nice. The meatballs were average...  If my glass was kept full, the tea was served with a tea bag and the fish didn't have go back I guess we would of had a nice dinner.  Don't see a reason to be back.

OMG this is a top of the table amazing place! Noah Schwartz and Phil Helmuth were in the house. If you follow pro poker you know! This is what all steak joints are measured against. Grade 5 Kobe, are you kidding me. Who serves that? If you follow the foodie code you know this is heaven. You can not find better. I enjoyed the standard... Shrimp cocktail, filet, creamed spinach, mashed and chocolate lava. Perfection. Yup this is heaven.

Dinner only. Ask for Angel. This is so cool they even have a tequila sommelier. Began with a recommended tequila flight and spicy crab guacamole. Amazing. Probably the best guac we have ever experienced. I had the filet. Wow. Had to finsh with coconut flan cake.  This was a dining experience we need to repeat.

Visit #2. Just as amazing. You must start with a consultation from the tequila sommelier. She recommended two limited edition Herradurra repasado's. One a 2013 finished in scotch oak barrels the other in 2014 Cognac barrels. Both nice, but I favor the scotch edition.  For dinner I had the short rib. Mrs had the snapper. OMG good.  Just awesome! We'll be back again soon!

We were searching for someplace new and we found it! This was a wonderful surprise. We had no expectations other than we are kinda picky.    So... We enter and find ourselves in a moody, copper table topped, rock and brick walled warm environment. The walls are adorned in local art. The music is contemporary cool easy listening.  Now for the food. WOW. I'm not easily WOWED! The eggs, onions, peppers and ham was prepared perfectly. You can taste the care and quality. Sweet onions, not white. Orange peppers, not green. Perfect chunks of ham, not yucky stuff in the ham.  It was a treat to experience great service and great food in a great space all at the same time.  Did I say GREAT? My hat is off to the chef!

I don't give 5 stars... This place is awesome!  Table service is superb! The food is just top shelf. Looking for a WOW dining experience, this is the place. Old school perfection. We enjoyed three courses and a wonderful selection of wine and tequila. Joey suggested we begin with the crab cake and boy was he right! The shrimp cocktail was as expected, perfect. The Cesar was topped with large shreds of aged parmesan. My filet was prepared with the finest attention. We tossed a curve an ordered a twice baked at the time our entree was presented, before I was able to slice my first bite, the hastily requested side arrived. Again WOW. We were inclined to to partake in flaming bananas foster and Godiva lava cake. Who cares what the bill is... This place exceeds expectations.

Wait for it, wait for it, wait some more, there are empty tables, wait for it,wait for it. Hmmm, still empty tables, lots of people outside. Whew... now we can sit.  Finally it is time for the best eggs is Arizona. The pancakes and waffles are tops too. Iced tea, perfection. Hot tea served with honey as expected. Probably the best breakfast in the country! If it weren't for the un-necessary extra wait this would be our new breakfast spot.

Quaint old world charm. The atmosphere is that of family run restaraunt in an European village.  The chefs understanding of fruits, vegetables, legumes and cheese is outstanding.  Rich served with panache and excitement for the evenings selection.  The market salad and the antipasto was unique and inspiring.  We shared a half margarita, half wise guy pizza. With wood fired crust from another world. You could put anything on that stuff and it be delicious.  What a great start to our evening! Definitely a date night first stop!  Gratci!

Service was 5 star! Ask for Dave.  We shared the evenings special, Braciole, flank steak from heaven, YUMM. This is worth the drive from anywhere.  I had the  PappaDelle, basically very meaty sauce with lasagna pasta. Nice.  To round out dinner we added a margarita pizza. Nothing better than wood fired pizza and thin crust.  I gotta be honest, the focaccia bread was my favorite. I should have stooped there!  As the duke, I must recommend!

As for the food, let's just say YUMM!  Perfectly prepared eggs, thick sliced ham and apple wood cured bacon, seared kale featured mixed greens and ciabatta toast.  The proprietor even greeted us and made sure all was perfect!       Jackie is a doll.  What a treat!

From the generous pour of my favorite Tequila to the bean dip, the meal begins with awesome flavor.  Our waiter kept our tea and water to the brim. The manager even stopped by to check on us.

The tequila selection is top shelf. I can always find an amazing treat in the repo's to the extra's.  Service is beyond expectations, Arnoldo is our guy!Suggestions, selections and spectacular delivery!  This is tied for my favorite Mexican restaurant in the U.S.

A great hide away off the beaten path. FRESH would definitely describe the cuisine. We tried the meat and cheese board and the Hummus tray to start. Both wonderfully prepared and presented. Dinner was lite and early for us this evening. Caesar with shrimp and chicken was our entrée selection for the boys. Ravioli and Bolognese for others. Nothing but complements. We enjoyed the patio and golf course views. Just a nice experience. We will be back to try more of the menu!

Dawn P is on the right track  Service is great!  As for the food...

We will give em another try in a month or to.

Ask for Adrian! She is feisty and fun!  I did my favorite test of a Restaraunt.  The blind order!   Adrian selected my meal fearlessly. She was not allowed to ask me any questions, just put in her choice. Only a well trained server with great management and terrific chef can deliver on this challenge!  Better to show you than tell you what was delivered. See the attached picture.  Great outdoor/indoor mex venue.  Young vibe.   Food is unique and worth trying!  Service is paced and fun.  Juice beverages are on trend and fuzzy!  A perfect Arizona evening dinner.

The bar is stocked with Herradura repo, so I feel comfortable in there taste!  I can't wait to try more. The burger looks amazing...

If you want Pastrami on rye...  This is the place. I don't give 5 star ratings unless I'm WOWed. First, if you want a NY deli sandwich outside of Manhattan, good luck! Except I just had an amazing experience. Double baked caraway rye. Served steamed. Perfectly sliced, perfectly prepared pastrami. Forget the perfect garlic dill pickle slice, that's the cherry on top.  My first bite squishes into the steamed rye, the dark deli mustard coats my tongue in preparation for the grand prize...the pastrami from heaven.  I live 37 miles from this place. Just try to keep me away!

They may be Hexxed.  Hmmm... Lets just say they are brand new and are on the strip. That's good.  Isaac the manager was kind enough to visit and apologize for the poor service and mis-marked prices on their high end sprits. He wouldn't fix the problem. If you are not turned off by the greeters, you may be...  Since they were charging $51 per shot for $18 tequila at the Bellagio, we went back to the Bellagio. I'm happy to pay $100 a glass for the good stuff.

Quaint and trendy! Start you day with the recommended hash or benedict. Wait, what's this, mimosa's. Now we are talking. Nice touch. I had my usual breakfast, a scramble with spinach, tomatoes and crispy bacon. Nailed it! I'm excited! Good food, nice staff, fun atmosphere, Internet and alcohol. I can't wait to bring friends.

First try! We sampled the provisions: Shrimp and Chorizo skewer, amazing! Peeled jumbo shrimp, perfection like sitting at a gulf side eatery in Florida. Ahi Tuna tostada, tuna was perfect, spice was too much for my taste, but I'm not a spicy lover. The Clam chowder was not chowder, more like soup, but it was a gastronomic treat. The textures, variety and flavor was at another level. A unexpected treat, a must try! My preference is that the bar is stocked with at least one favorite Tequila and they serve 1942 Anejo.  For the service, a solid 7, not bad, but not extraordinary.  I think I need to try again for dinner if I can  muster the discipline try something else. The chowder and the shrimp skewer are addicting!  Part TWO. (Full disclosure Allison gave me a gift certificate to come back)  Well... The clam chowder and fresh shrimp had to begin the feast. Growing up in Florida, fresh BIG shrimp always brings back fond memories. We tried the crab dip and I must say WOW! The wife enjoyed the (not) sea bass. It was a perfectly prepared fish with broccolini. The Boston kid and the Burbank kid both had the lobster rolls and were not disappointed. My crab cakes were great. The manager Laura stopped by to say hi. Of course we will be back! The ambiance is worth the trip. The food is just a treat that completes the experience. Love this place. LGO rocks!

Breakfast is a simple meal. Soooo...  This restaurant just changed names and menus. The place is kinda empty. The first week staff jitters are apparent. The staff is doing the best they can with the old customers and a new menu.  I ordered an off menu scramble which was nicely prepared. I like my bacon crispy.  There was, as requested,  two things on my plate eggs and bacon. The bacon was limp, not crispy. :-)  Am I to critical?   Just want crispy bacon as ordered.  Oh well. I'll give em one more try.

I sit in this nicely designed new breakfast restaurant. As one of the other reviewers stated it's a Denny/IHOP/Village Inn/ mix. The ambiance is bright and fresh. The food was ok, not bad just not exceptional. I had scrambled eggs and bacon. The eggs were prepared by folding and had a rubbery texture, not bad, just a style. The bacon was thick and tasty. (premium cut) The German pancakes seem to be the speciality. I guess I'm just too YELPy this morning. The pricing was as expected. I don't know. This place is on my way to work, I want WOW and I didn't find it.

Ok fellow foodies...  Only open 3 weeks this place is a welcome outdoor venue in downtown Phoenix. The atmosphere is alive on the patio. There is several conventions in town. Nice to see every place busy. The fountains and the lit trees almond with perfect 75 degree weather set the stage. Manny our server was great. He knew every item on the menu and how it was prepared. This is not a must stop destination, but the food was nicely prepared. I tried the Gambetti (shrimp) from the lunch menu (4 stars). The bruschetta was very tasty (3.5). From the dinner menu we had fettuccine and chicken, just what wanted. Also the grilled lamb chops tilted the scale at 4.5 stars. I'll be back when we see an early movie.  Once the pizza oven works I look forward to trying a slice!  Overall they delivered a nice experience.

First time!  As usual, we discarded the menu after getting the feel for the chef's ideas. I ordered my low carb standby; Cheeseburger, no bun, crispy (not burnt) bacon, caramelized onions and a side salad. Well they not only got it right the first time, the burger was exceptional! Perfectly prepared 1/2 pound and wonderfully seasoned. This place will be a great addition to our neighborhood. The bar looks to be well stocked and staffed with two tenders. The wait staff was attentive and on it! Never once did my iced tea run dry.  We will add this to our weekly quick and convenient dinner list.
