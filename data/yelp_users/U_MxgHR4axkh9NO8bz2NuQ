My first revolving sushi bar ever! I had a blast! Everyone is extremely nice and I love the option of special ordering sushi if you don't see what you want on the conveyor belt! Great prices too!

I followed Nikki here from her previous salon. She is amazing at coloring and styling your hair just the way you requested! I will never again go to anyone except her! Everytime she does my hair I receive so many compliments! Sweetest and nicest girl! I love her!

The bartender Kevin is absolutely the best bartender I have ever experienced! Definitely ask for him!!! They have corn hole and a lot of other fun games to play plus room to dance! Bathrooms were also completely stocked and super clean!
