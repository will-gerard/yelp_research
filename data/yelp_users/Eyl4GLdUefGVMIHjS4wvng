Very disappointing. Originally came to restaurant on a recommendation and was impressed, but after 5 years away i did not like the changes. The place has turned into a dive bar, and the servers are truly crabby. It is impossible to tell who is a guest and who is a server. The food is mediocre, service and atmosphere terrible. I will stay away from this restaurant and would advise others to do the same.

I went in today mainly to get some research for an English assignment for school and to sample food. What I didn't expect was the experience that I had. First off, the staff is very friendly and very welcoming. They greet you with a smile and make you feel at home. When they take your order, if you don't order a drink they give you a complimentary water glass. Not a plastic cup like most other restaurants. This is a legit glass that they use for fountain drinks. They bring your food to your table and come back regularly to check on how you are doing. Then on the off chance that you get to meet Joe while you are in there, he is the definition of working patron. He checks up on everyone, customers and staff alike, and is always willing to answer questions. He was glad to sit down with me so I could interview him to get some background information on the information, and that alone made my experience amazing. I would recommend Liberty Market to ANYONE looking for great food and great people

I've been coming to Taste of China since moving to Gilbert in 1999, and I have never been disappointed, whether eating in or ordering out. Service is great, food is great, and prices are affordable. Two must-try dishes are the House Chicken and Orange Chicken

I went to Down Under about a month ago with my parents as their driver while they did a wine tasting. The atmosphere in the bar was great. They had a great sense of fun, as it happened to be a karaoke night when we were there. One of the guests happened to bring a karaoke machine in and they encouraged all guests to participate. Even the bartenders had a brief cameo on the mic, showing that they incorporated a fun atmosphere in the bar.  The food was very good considering that they were not primarily a restaurant. I had the ribs, and they were the kind that you would eat to the bone and wonder where they all went when you were finished. The desserts were a little heavier than what I expected, but for a night out it was doable.  The service was great as well. They were very friendly, checking back on our table often to make sure everything was good, and if we needed refills on our drinks.  All in all, a very good place to go for a night out. Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.

First time coming back here in almost 4 years (then known as Lazy Q), and it was a vast improvement over the previous time. Great pricing on tables ($15 for the night after 6:00), and a phenomenal craft beer menu. Service was great, atmosphere is your general bar atmosphere, but if you're with a group of people, it makes for a great time. Very low key, hole in the wall type of place. Definitely my new regular hangout spot.

I started coming here once a week when it was Coffee Island, and it has gotten better since changing ownership. Don (the owner) is a great host. He really makes an effort to know his customers on a first name basis, which is nice to see from a coffee shop when so many chains are generic and less personal.  The menu is great and has many tasty items to try. A personal recommendation I have is the Love Guru drink, a praline and hazelnut drink that provides the perfect mix of flavors.  It's a great place to come once a week, and I would recommend Stella's to anyone looking for a different coffee experience

I had heard some great recommendations about this restaurant and decided to try it yesterday morning, and everything surpassed my expectations. Ralph, the owner, is always around the restaurant to talk to customers and make sure that everything they've ordered is up to their liking, and the food is phenomenal. Haven't been for lunch or dinner yet, but the breakfast burritos are definitely worth going there for.
