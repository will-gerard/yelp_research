I've been going here for about 12 years.  I have always loved the food, and every single friend I've taken has also loved it.  Now they go when they can, and recommend it to others.  It's true that I've gone on nights where it takes some time to get a table, and I've been there when it took a very long time to get food.  However, that has only happened to me a handful of times in 12 years so I can get over it.  Besides, it usually happens when they are short staffed on that night.  My only real complaint is that for some reason there's this one fly that continues to live in there and just flies around everywhere.  Very annoying.  The place is local, almost dive-ish, it's not fancy.  It's a great little joint and I crave 'em about once a week.  I highly recommend this place.

I was really looking forward to trying this place out but I left disappointed.  Ordered pizza and pasta and all anyone could taste was chili pepper.  Spaghetti and meat sauce?  Chili pepper.  Baked pasta and cheese?  Chili pepper.  The cheese pizza was cold and bland.  The one positive was the tzatziki dip.  Now that was good.  I'd definitely order that again.  The restaurant itself was also pretty warm inside.  And frankly, the food was entirely too expensive for what was served.

Came here because of reviews saying they have a great salad bar here.   However, they don't pay attention to the items at the salad bar. Leaving empty or almost empty bowls.   A few weeks ago I was at a Sizzler and was incredibly impressed by the hustle of the staff when it came to replenishing the salad bar. They were fantastic.   I would expect at least the same attention to detail, or more, that charges more for food.  Friend dining with me ordered a hamburger. Server asked him if he wanted "everything".  He said he did.   Burger arrives and there's no onions, mayo, mustard, etc. Evidently Ruby Tuesday's defines "everything" differently.   Weird thing.  Their napkins here are so cheap that you can see through them. What is up with that?  Lastly, ordered soup and the don't bring any Saltines or oyster crackers.  A person should get crackers when a single meal is $20.

This place was just horrible.  The front office staff are rude & unprofessional.  They will sit there and completely ignore you.  The waiting area just looks dirty and unpleasant.  First impression was this place was just scary and desperate.  Needs new paint, new floors, better seating.  Signage is incomplete.  Never fails that you are put on endless hold when calling the office to make an appt.  And when you do actually get scheduled you end up waiting LOOOONG after your set appt time to actually get called back and then don't be surprised if you're left waiting in an "exam room" for another hour.  I put quotes around "exam room" because the room I was put into, while it had the exam bed thing, it also had multiple boxes and various junk stacked up so basically it was a storage room.  Absolutely unprofessional.  The sort of place I'd expect to see in a refugee camp.

This is now my go-to for Italian food in the area.  Small place, in a strip mall, no pretentiousness.  Pizza, pasta, salad, soda, etc.  I get their baked ziti and love it.  My friend gets the spaghetti with meatballs and also really enjoys it.  My only complaint and warning would be to stay away from the cheesecake, no matter what.  Maybe it was a fluke, but when we had it, it was like it wasn't fully cooked.  The graham cracker crust didn't taste at all like graham crackers, it was more like sugar crystals.  It was just so wrong.  I've had cheesecake from coast to coast--it's my favorite dessert.  So take my word on this one, avoid the cheesecake at all costs!

I've had their food multiple times and it's always been average and acceptable but it seems the quality is going downhill lately.  I use grubhub to get Sal's food delivered so I've never actually been inside the establishment.  The cost of delivery is relatively cheap compared to other places, so I'll go with them when I can't figure out what I want to eat.  However, the cheese tortellini tastes like the standard frozen stuff from Costco.  I'm currently looking at a $5 order of pepperoni rolls that are all burned black.  The house salad is a handful of shredded lettuce that is obviously used on sandwiches, just like one sees in a bin at Subway.  In a pinch this place will do, but frankly, they're pretty mediocre.  Anyone who thinks this place has "Great Italian food" needs to go out to more Italian places.

My family has been coming here since 1994. They've expanded quite a bit, two locations now, but the original staff seems to all be here at the Litchfield location.   There are nights when things are horribly slow but most of the time it's fine.   Family-owned, has regulars; this is my go-to for Mexican.

Found the experience very interesting and I'd definitely go back again.  Though I do have to say, one of the guys who runs the place is not very friendly, doesn't really smile and is pretty off-putting.  The other guy, who did the instructions for the class was far more amiable.  But, knowing that, I'd still go back for other classes.  It was fun and definitely worth the Groupon price.

Tonight, a Saturday, we went to Gus's at 5pm.  The place was empty and they absolutely REFUSED to let us sit at the table we wanted.  Their excuse?  A sport's game would be on an HOUR later and they expected a crowd.  I could not believe how they treated us.  They would not budge on this.  Ridiculous.  There were only two of us and I would think they could have served us within an hour and we'd be gone.  Anyway, clearly their customer service is awful, so beware.  I've had their delivery before and it was extremely greasy, but that was expected from a pizza joint.  Overall, I'm pretty annoyed at how we were treated tonight.  We left and went elsewhere.  NOTE:  This place is tiny.

Okay, give me break. Wait a half hour for the stupid garlic knots, pretty much ready to leave, and they finally arrive burned.  What do we get told?  Oh they do that intentionally so it won't be raw.   Really?  So the table to our left, theirs is NOT burned because.....why exactly?  The server was lovely, polite and helpful.   But this is NOT the first time the owner has been a dick to us. After multiple visits I have to believe he has some sort of issue with gender or appearance.   The "upgrade" to two stars is for the server being nice.   Otherwise, this place is a zero. Go to a different location.  Maybe a different franchisee will result in less horrid behavior.   The food can be tasty but expect to wait a VERY long time to get it. That is a consistent trait here.  At least for us.   Good luck!

Service is good as are the prices. Could really do without the hard sell of extra products and deals though.

I found this repair place in a Google search and saw how many positive reviews they received, plus they are members of the Better Business Bureau, so I took a chance and scheduled with them.  I was a little nervous since I'd never used them before, and when I hadn't received a call by 12:45pm for an 11am-1pm window I called the office to make sure things were still on track.  The repair guy called soon after and said he was on his way.  He showed up and was friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful.  Bonus, he was also really cute!  Though that last bit wouldn't have mattered if he was a jerk or trying to scam me.  He did what he was supposed to, checking out my fridge, diagnosing the problem, and offered multiple solutions.  He also answered all my questions without hesitation.  He even looked up info about buying a new fridge at various stores in the area during the Black Friday sales when it looked like the part I would need would be about the same cost as a new fridge.  I'd definitely call them again for other appliance issues in the future.  I'd also hope they sent the same guy out, and not just because he was good-looking!  :)
