If you want a great family restaurant when you visit Phoenix offering superior pizza and salad, visit Spinatos. Great sauce, Great atmosphere, and very economical for a family. Highly recommend

My Fiancee and I purchased a king mattress and box springs  from Steve Berdrow. Steve was fast and efficient and save me hundreds of dollars from similar mattress and springs at Costco. I would highly recommend Steve and R&S mattress for your mattress needs.

Sandwiches are $3.99, not a bad stop for a quick lunch.

What a garbage company. I will find other ways to secure ticket next time. $79 ticket becomes $100 ticket with fees, and processing charges. Talk about non-transparency and false advertising. Never again. I would rather you advertise $100 ticket and include fees.   Ticketmaster has way too many undisclosed fees until you are at final pay area. Pure garbage.

I have been traveling back and forth from San Diego and Phoenix last couple of years for work and family. I have played, taken lessons and clinics here (Paseo) and Balboa (SD). The staff and instruction far exceed the same at Balboa. Great value for $ spent. I would recommend any tennis players looking for some excercise and working on the game to visit Paseo. Nicer courts, much better instruction. Only thing better at Balboa is the weather in the summer time.

Strip mall Italian restaurant with above average food. Great value for the price. My children love their spaghetti and meatballs. Have been visiting for quite some time and never have had a bad experience. Only problem is that they have outgrown their restaurant. Usually a wait in the evenings. Other than that, food is great, service is good .

Once again a state owned monopoly is after solar users in the "VALLEY OF THE SUN". Instead of embracing solar technology and trying to encourage other customers to go green and reduce the amount of energy coming from coal burning, smog polluting power plants, they have followed APS's failed attempt to levy a $50 to $100 surcharge against customers who have installed roof top solar. Unbelievable, money grubbing, over paid employees of a state sponsored monopoly can never get enough. SRP are money vampires!

I am the fourth generation to visit La Perla, I am 54 and have been coming since I was 3 or 4. Good food, not great, but feels like home. Chips and salsa are always good. Try a green enchilada, a favorite, with a chicken taco. Pass on the margaritas, too pricey for what they serve

Large hotel without much personality. Rooms are large but you walk along way. Shower's fiberglass bottoms are slick. I would stay at other properties on next go round.

Visitied on Easter after golfing on a semi-hot day. Excellent chips and salsa/hot sauce to try before dinner. Had the appetizer for two, pollo fundido, a red and green tamale and 2 taquitos. Very good and filling for the $$ spent, would recommend highly! Cadillac margaritas hit the spot on a hot day.

Overpriced, average food, best part of evening was the wine. Would not recommend. Also pricey for the type of food. A half salad is close to the same as a full salad. They will not split salads in kitchen, you have to split at table, manager made sure that we would not ask next time, guess what , there wont be a next time.

This review reflects their billing department and not the medical care received, I had a life threatening blood infection from the bite of a mosquito, The hospital did a good job of diagnosing the problem. I was in their hospital approximately 4 hours before being transferred  to an In-Network hospital. I was hospitalized at JCL Hospital from 11/24/15 until 12/31/15. I received my first  bill from the Mayo  E.R. visit on 1/18/2016. My 4 hours in the E.R. cost me $9,138.92. I called the billing department and they adjusted my payment based on the fact that I would be paying cash to $4227.94 because insurance company classified Mayo as out of network so the entire amount went into my out of network deductible of $12,000. I started making payments of a $100 a month while I worked an appeal thru my insurance that the E.R. visit was life threatening and should be covered in-network. In the mean time, I made payments as agreed to Mayo clinic. In late April I won my appeal and my insurance company agreed to pay $7000 plus against my $4000 balance. Remember now, I had made payments on the negotiated amount and have statements to show what Mayo Clinic said was my complete balance. In fact they were threatening for collection activity unless I pad the $4000 by May 31, 2016, which by the way was illegal also once a monthly payment plan had been established. When Mayo Clinic received the payments from my insurance company, they adjusted up my account from the negotiated amount and even though they received $3,000 plus more than what they agreed to, they say now I owe them $2,000. What a racket, fraud , and just downright dishonest. My $4000 balance went to $9138.92 and they did not even credit the payments received in the interim. Mayo Clinic insists that what they did was legal and happens all the time. We will see and I will update yelp followers on what the Attorney General and Department of Insurance has to say when it is all settled. In the mean time, I recommend using another E.R. hospital if at all possible. Look at the numbers $9000 plus for 4 hours, I think medical costs are way out of hand in our country, but that is another story for another day.

Previously reviewed but removed for lack of content. I visited the restaurant with my son this past week during the afternoon. I felt that the establishment is more of a bar atmosphere than a restaurant. The tacos I had I felt were marginal at best. Arizona is full of mexican food restaurants and I certainly would not recommend this establishment for food, but perhaps late night the bar appears to be a place to meet.

Wow, visitied last evening after reading reviews on yelp for tuna poke. Excellent, excellent sushi for fair price in Scottsdale area. Would be 5 stars except came in around 8:30 and restaurant closed at 9,  servers wanted to go home and we were rushed. Food tho, excellent. Will try again during week, but they are not late night on Sunday, lol, and they let you know.

This is a no star company, once a monopoly but no more, now you have solar as an alternative at least for the moment. APS is secretely funding anti solar commercials, TV and print and using a fat, ugly lobbyist, Chris May, to be their mouthpiece. TV commercials picture one neighbor against the other , insinuating the neighbor without solar pays for his next door neighbors electricty. Tell APS's Prosper and 60 plus campaigns to go back to the dark hole they climbed out of and shine some light on their true source of their monetary backers. APS will go the way of landline phone companies. They need to change with the future instead of using lobbyists to try and protect their dinosaur way of having a monopoly on electricity produced by nuclear, coal and oil. Solar is the future, inexpensive and clean.

Dollar gave me a 2014 Dodge Avenger with 71K on odometer. Car was all over road and brakes squeaked. I know dollar didnt build it, but what a garbage car. I will never ever rent a dodge again.

Visitied last night for some late evening sushi, Usually not a problem, but they have remodeled restaurant and bar area. Now bar patrons are so close to restaurant crowd that is impossible to have a quite evening with significant other. A very large group of people who overstayed happy hour and tried to talk over the rest of their party made for an extremely unpleasant evening of not being able to talk to someone 2 ft across from me in the restaurant booth. Kona Grill is not inexpensive, even for a a couple of glasses of wine and small sushi order its always a $50 bill. Won't be revisiting until management figures out how to put back the ambiance the place once had, where a conversation could be shared among 2 people. Management did offer to move us to patio with misters, but who wants to sit outside in the summer monsoon season with 80 degree humidity and a temp of 105? Lol, that is why the patio was empty and quite.

I met Dr. Rand by chance as the on-call  foot surgeon during a long hospital stay from a complicated blood infection. I endured 4 surgeries and had the possibility of losing my left foot. Although the recovery and rehab has been anything but easy, I have my foot and am walking with a slight limp wearing shoes. I have a long way to go for a full recovery as the foot portion was just a minor complication from the more serious blood infection which attacked my spine and bone marrow. I was lucky to have a talented surgeon on call that night. I would highly recommend Dr. Rand and his staff if ever in need of anything to do with your feet.

Communication and scheduling of trainers and sessions are horrible. maybe a good concept, but once again you are only as good as the people who manage the gym. In this case and this specific location, way below expectations. Twice trainer a no show and said he called and left a message. I think not, so a 1 star for this gym is well deserved, whether the trainer or manager made a mistake, its still twice in a month and no more opportunities for me.

Just got off phone and reduced monthly internet and tv bill from $190 to $89 a month. Ridiculous the games cable providers play. Hope Google gets the whole country with high speed soon. Would like to cut the cord as quickly as possible.

Great prices, but get ready for a daily dose of humility. They do a great job of having your clothes cleaned and on time for an inexpensive price, but lady behind the counter has a very dry sense of humor. Dont make her work too hard or she will let you know that the price you pay for cleaning is not worth any aggravation from a customer. I look to go pick up my clothes just to see what comes out of her mouth. Makes my day!

From purchasing desktops and laptops, to repair of existing technology, Computers and ? gets my vote in the Phoenix area for fast, friendly customer attention. I only wish they had a San Diego branch open. I have purchased and repaired many items and have never been disappointed either with the price I paid or the support I received. I appreciate they are always willing to answer a question on the phone and take time to diagnose the problem the first time .

Food is above average, Pricing is astronomical. New restaurant, new staff, lots of room for improvement for the $$$$ they are charging. Lost our reservation and ran out of bread. Difficult to find and if you go to far and take a left turn on Pima, there is no easy return.  Lots of reviews for happy hour, may try that next time, but a big No for dinner.
