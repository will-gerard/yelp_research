Terrible. ...ordered one of the signature cheesessteak sandwiches for pickup. ...I asked for a mushroom with onions extra sweet peppers. ..$20 something dollars later..I get home and unwrapped  a  disaster.  Stale  bread, beef as dry as cardboard,  little to no cheese, oh and don't even ask about the mushrooms and sweet peppers. .None!.....extremely disappointed. ..don't waist your money
