Service was horrible! Cashier (guy with glasses, no name tag) gave my 9 year old daughter attitude when she asked questions. Charge extra for pickles on her hamburger? Really? Since when isn't that a standard item on a hamburger? Just overall rude man ... Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Food was average.

So glad I found this place! So beautiful and welcoming to their clients. The pedicures are to die for! Loved the scented candle, the leaves in the water, the massage chairs, the leg massage, loved it all! Loved it and will be back!

My husband ordered a grilled chicken sub, the girl asks "white or wheat?" Hubby says, "white." His food comes and it's an actual SALAD - not a sub. So the kid that delivered it, takes it back, hubby looks at receipt, and the girl had pressed SALAD, even though she asked him, "white or wheat." Unbelievable. Then I asked for roast beef with only mustard, it comes with spicy mustard. Horrible. Won't be coming back.
