AMAZING!   Everything is great, especially the pulled pork, the food is always hot, fast, and delicious! I've had take out and dined in, the food is always up to par. The employees are always friendly and funny. Grab some napkins for a finger licking good time! I suggest this place to everyone I work with since they are right across the street; I've been begging our managers to have Hap's cater a lunch for us!   Seriously, enjoy!   PS. Honey Bears doesn't hold a candle to Hap's!  Only 4 stars because this restaurant should have later hours during the week, be open for more than 6 1/2 hours on Saturday, and just plain open on Sunday's. I get off work at 7 PM and would like to grab some Hap's for dinner but I can't because they close at 7.

I've been using AAC for almost 10 years, after all this time the service is still horrific! They have no respect for you or your pet. Try to call, no answer; leave a message, they won't return it; most important, ask for your pets pain medication to be called out to the pharmacy, it won't happen! I called 5 days ago, they had to ask the Dr of course. After not hearing anything from the pharmacy for days I called AAC and was advised my dog needed to be seen, why I was not contacted about this 5 days ago is beyond me. My poor baby is now out of medication and they will not even fill 2 weeks worth so I can make it in for an appointment. Today is my only day off for 2 weeks, had they called me 5 days ago I could have been there today! This is NOT the first time this has happened and I'm sure it wouldn't have been the last time, if I was going to go there again, which I will not! It ALWAYS takes an average of 3 or more phone calls to get prescriptions filled or questions answered. Don't waste your time or money here, your pets don't deserve their incompetence.

Delicious diner food! If you order the All-Star meal ask them wait to make your waffle until you're ready for it, that way it's hot and fresh! Bring a jacket it's Antarctica in here!

Delish! Get the crab puffs! The orange and sweet and sour chicken are great, my boyfriend loves the beef and broccoli.  Carry out is ready when promised.

Love this location, the staff is always friendly and presentable (unlike other locations).  The food is fresh about 98% of the time, the counters are always clean, the food itself is always in the proper bins and looks very tidy. They always have enough bread and seem to have all kinds available, the bread is always soft and fluffy, never overcooked. I always enjoy the sandwiches here.  The only negative, sometimes when you come in no one is up front and you need to wait a few minutes or yell for someone to come help you.
