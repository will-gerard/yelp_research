This place was great! They had everything ready for me, all the paperwork was in order and made sense. I was given an estimate as to how much I would end up paying after everything is done and what all the different bills would be. The staff was so friendly and caring and made sure I had everything I needed before getting my endoscopy. Dr. David was great and it took no time at all.

The first thing you need to know is that this is a "place your order and sit down" cafe. Second thing to know is that everyone is very friendly here and wants to make sure you enjoy your food. I had the 2 egg breakfast with bacon and wheat toast. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted great! The only strange thing was plastic silverware, but it worked just fine and not a big deal. I wasn't a fan of the coffee, but my wife really enjoyed it and her breakfast as well.   I would definitely recommend this place as a casual "off the beaten path" cafe.

This review is about Terminix company in general.  All this company really cares about is making money any way they can. They didn't care about any pest problem and if you want a guarantee of their services you have to pay extra! I would get a call about every month asking me if I wanted to upgrade my service so that I could be "protected" and they always asked me "why" when I told them NO.   During my last month of service they called me to inform me that the credit card they had on file had expired and I needed to provide them with the new expiration date. At the time I didn't have the card with me and they said they would call back before my next scheduled service. Nobody ever called. And since I never gave them the new expiration, they didn't even bother coming to do any pest control or even call! I have now switched to Alpha Ecological Pest Control and they seem to provide a much better customer service and their products are all kid/pet friendly, which is very important to me.

This place has definitely gone downhill since my usual visits years ago. Their menu is constantly changing and it's so big you'll spend at least 10 minutes just looking over what you want. The food is sub-par compared to other places that serve the same type of food. Heck, P.F. Chang's just across the way is much better and you pay only a few dollars more, but the statement is true "you get what you pay for" and this location definitely proves that everytime.

My wife and I love this place for any meal of the day, whether it be breakfast, lunch, or dinner. There's always something on the menu that I can find enjoyable. I love the fact that you can get breakfast all day and their Cocina 55 menu after 4pm is excellent! The restaurant is a little small and we don't care much for their chairs, but if you're in the area and looking for something to eat, this is the place! They have tons of local beers on tap that you can choose from and you have to try their homemade chips, they're the bomb!

Our freezer decided to go out 3 days before Thanksgiving! We needed to have it fixed tonight because our kitchen was being cleaned the next day. I called them at 6p on a Sunday night and someone actually picked up the phone, talked to me, and then someone was at my door an hour later! Rick came in, took one look, and replaced the part. It was AMAZING! Then he handed me the bill and it was even better!! Go with these guys when you need an appliance fixed anytime!

I found Alpha Ecological after having problems with Terminix and wanting to find a pest control company that used organic and all natural products (without the extra charge). After looking up companies on Yelp I came across Alpha Ecological and did some research on their website, which is very professional and gives a lot of information about their company. I gave them a call and was greeted by a very professional customer service that was able to setup an initial pest control spray. The employee that came to spray was very professional and gave me a lot of good tips about preventing pests, without trying to sell me products or additional services like other pest control companies do. My favorite part about Alpha Ecological (besides their excellent pest control) is that I can pay my bill online and get paperless receipts! It's so much more convenient for me and I feel safer than writing down my credit card information on a piece of paper. I would definitely recommend them as your next pest control company!

I've been drinking Starbucks coffee for years, but as soon as this place showed up I will only go to Starbucks if I'm way out of town. The coffee is strong and made with such flavor that you just can't compare it to Starbucks. Their staff is helpful and know how to make coffee. The atmosphere is relaxed and allows for kids to play around without knocking stuff over.  My wife and I are definitely impressed and are loyal to this local business!

They weren't able to fix my washing machine because the technician said it was caused by the spider bracket and it would cost more to fix it than to buy a new one. So, I went and bought a new washing machine and took apart the old one. Spider bracket seemed to be fine, so I'm still not sure what the problem was and I don't think the technician knew either. They seem to be a small business, so it could be that they are still learning, but next time I'll go with a more trusted company.

The fact that we can get a pizza for both my kids to share and the cost is the same no matter how many toppings you add makes this place the absolute best! Their pizzas are delicious and large enough to feed 1-2 people. I ask to get my pizza cooked a little longer because I like crispier crust and they are very accomodating.
