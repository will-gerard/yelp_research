This place is pretty reasonable.  Manicures are $10, Spa pedicures $18, for french tips (just the painting, not the fake type) add $5.  There is usually no wait and they are quite efficient.  The paint job they do is pretty good too.  I suggest waiting a little longer than they tell you for your nails to dry - but I think that's a continual problem.  Every time I have gone in the place is always clean.  It's nothing fancy inside, but that's not what matters.  I'd suggest it if you're looking for a place to stop in and get your nails done!

It's a pretty good Community College.  I only took 2 classes here, while still in high school, but the teacher's were friendly and understanding.  I've had a lot of friends that have gone there too.  The cost is pretty cheap and a good way to get some of the basic college credits out of the way.  It's a pretty spread out campus, which can be the only bad thing.  Also, during peak hours parking can be a challenge.

*YUMMY* is all I have to say about this place.  It's your typical cheap Mexican food place that are a dime-a-dozen in Phoenix.  This has always been one of my favorites though.  The carne asada burrito is huge and well worth the $5.25 you'll pay for it.  The place doesn't look so great from the outside and the drive-thru is a little strange, but it's delicious.  It's also never made me sick, so no worries in that department.  Go, eat, and enjoy the place.

Many a year ago - I'm talking like 1998 - this place had delicious food.  However, the few times I've been there in the past, oh, 3 years, the food has been *awful*.  One time I didn't even get to the food because we walked out after waiting about 40 minutes without even having drink orders taken.  They changed their menu and took the delicious chicken dish off and replaced it with a lot more "fancy" type things, that they just don't prepare well.  I'd recommend yelping BBQ and finding a better place to eat!

Now, I am very hesitant to give a dentist 5 stars.  I mean if I was rating dentists as a whole, I would give them negative stars.  I have gone to a *lot* of dentists in my day and would never have considered giving one above 3 stars.  Then, I met Dr. Wyatt.    First, his helpers are super helpful and friendly.  They are nice and sometimes when they ask a question, they actually take the tools out of your mouth for you to answer!  Second, Dr. Wyatt himself follows suit and is nice.  Even when you have issues he's nice about it.  He doesn't lecture or raise his voice or even seem angry that you don't do something, like oh floss all the time...  He truly seems like he wants you to have a happy, healthy smile, not like he is frustrated with your behavior.  Lastly, his office is called "Reel Dental" and they have a movie theme.  Though somewhat cheesy, it's nice to have movies on in the waiting room and such.  Rumor has it that when you go in for long dental work, which I never have, you can watch a movie while it's done!  Anything to take your mind of the fact you're in a dentist chair is great.  Oh, and for the ladies, he's quite easy on the eyes to look at while being worked on!

I met a friend from high school here on a Sunday morning for some breakfast. The place was busy, but despite that we still had pretty great service.  The french toast was yummy and what you'd expect from a chain. The food came out quick. Since it was reunion of sorts, I was happy they didn't seem to mind us sitting for about an hour and a half while catching up.  Definitely would come back.

This place has pretty awesome food.  Sadly, they lose a star because they keep increasing prices and the food isn't getting all that much better or changing.  The same people have owned it for a really long time though which is nice because the food and service are consistent.  They have a great lunch deal.

This is some of the best BBQ I've had in the Phoenix area.  It's a standard place where my parents go when they want to get some dinner out.  I love the "lite eaters" menu because I'm never hungry enough (after consuming lots of appetizers) to finish a meal.  I highly recommend the fried mushrooms and coming while super hungry!!

I rented a car here to drive from PHX to San Diego for a mini vacation in December.  I know it was around the holidays but the wait to talk to a representative was crazy.  I went in on a Monday afternoon and spent over 30 minutes standing in line to talk to a representative.  While I was standing in line there were not one, but two, customers complaining.    Once I did get up the to counter it was ok service.  The lady was very apologetic about the customer who had been yelling obscenities (yes, that's how upset people were).  She told me one car was available, then when she went to process it through the system it was gone.  Eventually I ended up in a car in the size I reserved and they just happened to throw in their GPS system for free because it was the only way they could get me the kind of car I wanted.  I get the feeling that wouldn't have been a perk if I was willing to pay for it (since they tried to sell me on it before telling me the car had it anyway).    After getting all my paperwork I went on my merry way down to find my car.  The keys were in the car and I was standing by the car waiting for someone to come assist me, which is how it's always been in the past usually.  Eventually another customer came up and told me that there was nobody working the lot and they just expected you to drive it to the "check out."  It would have been nice had someone told me that or if they had signs to that effect.    I am glad I knew to look at the car before getting in since when I got to the "check out" they told me the cameras weren't working and I get the feeling had I not had the insurance they wouldn't have even looked at the car.    The only nice part was that with Hertz you can return the car at any location.  Since I was staying with family in PHX and just renting a car for a few days, it was convenient to not have to go back to the airport and deal with that.  Definitely not my best experience renting a car.

I have only eaten 3 things from here - caprese, gnocchi, and cannoli.    I live in Seattle but make sure to get the Caprese every time I come to Phoenix.  Actually, I crave it when I'm not here.  Their mozerella is so fresh and the mix of tomatoes and spices tops it off perfect.  Their bread is consistently fabulous and I think some of the best in the city.  The gnocchi I've only munched on from another persons plate, but I think it's pretty delicious.    The cannoli is some of the best I've had since I left the east coast.  I love the bits of chocolate in the creme in the center.  The place is a bit pricey, but since there's not a lot of other quality places like this in the entire city.

It's an antique mall and it's huge.  Waaay back in the day this used to be *the* place to find Beanie Babies.  They have lots of glass displays and definitely a fair share of furniture.  They are a pretty decent place to spend a couple of hours on a weekend.

This place is pretty good.  The cakes and cookies are pretty scrumptious.  I don't know if I've ever had anything else but a few different cakes from here, but it's a great place to go.  They even have sugar free stuff.  I've never had any, but from the stuff they make with sugar, I think it would be pretty decent.

Coming from Seattle and being used to a completely different style of Chinese food, this place was acceptable.  The service was quick, they didn't mind the 3 of us sitting at a table for a while, and the food was ok.  It's one of the better places I've had Chinese food in Phoenix and would definitely go back.  I had the Mongolian Beef and it was quite bland, but good nonetheless.  I'd definitely go here again.

My interaction with Bobbie's was minimal, but great.  With Mother's Day coming up, I wanted to send my Mom who lives in Phoenix some flowers.  I came to Yelp, searched for a florist with good reviews, and found Bobbie's.  I investigated their website and really liked that they showed which arrangements came from Teleflora.  After browsing their website I found a bouquet and placed an order.  Simple, easy, and I could do it at an hour that things weren't open on the west coast.    The next day (as requested) the flowers showed up at my Mom's office.  The flowers made her very happy.  The pictures she took look pretty similar to what I ordered and she was very happy with them.  All the ladies at her office were impressed with the arrangement.  My Mom's biggest compliment was that the flowers smell good and seem to be very fresh.  I'd definitely recommend Bobbie's if you need to surprise someone with some flowers!

I was visiting my parents in Arizona over Christmas and received a few checks I wanted to deposit.  I bank with a credit union up in Washington and a search told me this was a credit union service center and would accept my deposits.  I came here probably 2-3 times in a two week period to deposit checks.  The tellers were always very friendly (I used the same one twice) and knew exactly how to do the transaction.  My only issue was one time I came there was a HUGE line to see a teller.  The line was out of their line-up area thing and it took probably 20 minutes of waiting.

So normally I'm not that tough on places, but I think when you're serving Mexican food in Phoenix, there is a certain level of expectation.  They get one star for having decent service and another star for having quite good portions.    On the other hand, the food was crap, especially for the price I was paying.  I had steak fajitas, not normally the cheapest thing, but for something between $12-$15 I expected something tastier.  If they had been the most delicious thing ever, I wouldn't have cared but I didn't even take the half of the food I had left home.  The steak had a funny after taste and a lot of my onions were burnt.  The beans were mediocre and tortillas were average.    On the whole, it was a decent dining experience but not what I would have wanted for the price.  You can get a lot better Mexican food in Phoenix (and for a lot cheaper).  I'd recommend coming here only if it's the most convenient place.

I spent 4 years eating at the Bison Witches in Tucson.  Though this place clearly isn't in Tucson, the menu holds dear food memories to me and it would probably be hard for me to not rave about it.  I love their 1/2 sandwich 1/2 soup option.  I love the potato bacon soup.  Their bread the sandwiches come on is always delicious.  It's big and thick and always fresh.  The service was a bit slow at first, but once the waitress came over it was good from there.  I definitely suggest giving Bison Witches a try if you haven't before.  If you've been, even to another location, you know this place is great!

This mall is scary!  Back in the early 00s I worked there and it was getting bad then -- think jewelry store holdups, constant fights (gang and non-gang related), and TONS of car thefts.    The mall used to be good, in the mid 90s, but it really has gone down hill.  Many of the stores are even crappy.  I wouldn't waste my time or money here.

I quite enjoy this place.  It's nice to have the meat and cheese sliced in front of you.  Though it's a bit pricer than some of the other chain shops but it's well worth it.  The food has always been fresh and filling.  Their pasta is decent, but I prefer to stick with the subs.    The wait can be a bit long during peak hours, but it's well worth the wait.

This is a pretty decent high school.  There are some good teachers, others that aren't as great.  They counselors are pretty good and work with you to plan your college career.  When I was there I was given the opportunity to do some classes at the local community college credits that counted as high school credits too.  It was nice to have come credits done by the time I hit college.  I've heard that since I graduated (2002) they've started some pretty neat programs to get students started off with some pretty good college credits if they choose.  The athletics are decent and fluctuate yearly as most high schools do.  The parking lot fills up pretty quick, but nothing too bad.

Ahhh, good old QT.  What is there not to love about QT?  They let you mix soft drinks and have sooo many good options for beverages.  Their food isn't awful (actually pretty good for convenience store food) and the people are typically fairly friendly.  Though it's a chain, I think this is a pretty good QT.

It's a chain but they have amazing service and delicious food.  The portions seem to vary depending on how busy they are, but they're never tiny.  Go with an appetite and a friend (or many) so you can share dishes!

After a horrible burrito experience, the husband and I came here hoping to split a steak sandwich that was better.  Clearly this is a chain and we knew what to expect.  Compared to other Great Steak & Potato locations, this place is somewhat of a disappointment.  First, the prices are ridiculous.  I know I'm in an airport, but there needs to some reasonableness in the prices.  Second, the food was absolutely greasy.  I know great steak usually is a bit greasy, but by the time we got our sandwich from the line to our table it had soaked through the paper.  They did not ask if we wanted lettuce and tomato and just put it on anyway.    The fries themselves were mediocre, but the cheese  for them was old and a bit stale tasting.  The place was dirty and not well maintained.  It was awful compared to other locations of the same chain.

I came here at about 6 pm on a Friday to try and snag a table for 7 at 6:30 pm. It wasn't a game night or anything but I was still a bit worried about the wait. By 6:15 the hubby and I were sitting at our table. However, everyone else was showing up at 6:30. The staff was understanding and didn't give us any problems about the wait.   Our server was fabulous. She was attentive and incredibly pleasant and friendly. She noticed every time someone joined our party and was quick to help them.   We started with some snacks to kill time while waiting for our friends to show up. I opted for the guacamole and chips. I wasn't too sure about the feta in the guac but it turned out to be good. The hubby had the sweet potato fries and maple bacon dip. I'm not a sweet potato lover but I may have eaten them just for the dip. It was nice to have a "snack" sized portion that was perfect for just that - snacking. I had the turkey club for dinner which had avocado on it. It was nothing special but still pretty good. The hubby had a spicy thai chicken pizza that he seemed to really enjoy. Overall, it seemed like everyone in the party enjoyed their meals.   Their beer selection is pretty awesome. In reality, that was the reason we opted for the Yard House for dinner. The server was great at knowing what they had run out of and what wasn't on the menu.  For those unfamiliar with beers, she seemed to know what to suggest based on tastes.   At the end of the meal, there was no issue splitting the check and getting separate bills. That was refreshing from what I'm used to. Overall it was a pretty good dining experience and I wouldn't hesitate to come back again.

YUM!  If I lived in Phoenix this would be a place I frequented.  My dining companion was nice enough to share food with me so I could try more things.  First item up was the raspberry chicken salad.  I love Gorgonzola.  I love nuts in salads.  I love raspberry vinaigrettes.  I loved this salad.  The greens were fresh, there wasn't too much chicken, and nothing was too overpowering in the salad.  It was balanced mix and so delightful!  Second item(s) was the bruschetta.  You get a selection of 4 types and it would have definitely been enough for the two of us to share without anything else.  Each selection has about 4 small(ish) slices.  Our first choice was the fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil.  It was good and everything was fresh, but kind of meh compared to the other ones.  The burrata, bacon, argula and tomato was nice. I can't remember which one we decided on for the third (not surprising since I'm writing this review a few weeks later).  And the last was the tomato jam & sheeps milk cheese which was delicious!    I feel like this place probably serves up everything delicious and it would be hard to go wrong with anything you ordered here.  The one thing that sucks is that it is pretty much valet parking only.  It's complimentary but still a hassle.  If you're in the area I definitely suggest you check this place out!

This place was so awful.  The husband and I had a layover in Vegas.  Luckily, we were indecisive and decided to split a burrito from here and then decide if was worth another $9 burrito.  For such high cost, I'd expect Chipotle sized, but it was not at all.  We ordered a thai burrito and it was so disappointing.    The staff was not friendly and they charge for everything.  Pretty much if it's not listed in your burrito, they're going to charge for it - even common things like sour cream or cheese.  Pretty much, unless this your only option for food, save yourself and go somewhere else.

Pretty good way to spend a warm spring or fall evening.  Drive-Inn movies are so much fun.  Glendale sometimes does double features that are a pretty good deal.  The place is nothing special, but one of the few Drive-Inns still around.

I was delighted over Christmas to see a Dunkin' Donuts in Phoenix.  Their coffee was good, their donuts were fresh, and the service was ok.  One time I came here they were out of a lot of options, which is always disappointing, but that happens at all bakery/donut places.  And they sell Dunkin' K-Cups here which is great!

For a chain restaurant, this place is pretty good.  The menu isn't so extensive that you lose quality in food.  Actually, having a one page menu plus a one page alcohol menu is my ideal.  I got the Pollo Rosa Maria and it was actually pretty delicious.  I had spaghetti as my side and that left a bit to be desired, but still complemented my meal nicely.    The salad came quickly, as did the bread.  No complaints there.  The service was attentive and my drink never went empty.  However, when I said I had never been to a Carrabbas before the server proceeded to explain nearly every dish on the menu.  I could have lived without that, but I suppose it could be useful to have the Italian words (that are quite obvious what they mean in English) explained to some.  Overall, for a chain Italian place this is pretty good.  In my book the quality is significantly better than Olive Garden, but the range of selection is much more limited.
