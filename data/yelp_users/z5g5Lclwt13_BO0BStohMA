The closer I move to Welcome, the fatter I'll get. Everything is that good. I reminds me of little food bars in New Orleans' Irish Channel. And save room for a cocktail or punch.   Indoor seating is super limited, so be careful in arizona summers

Typical anglophiles, my lady and I gravitated toward the tea garden. But that doesn't mean we didn't love photographing and learning about the myriad plants that call the desert home.  I was particularly enchanted by the century agave and giraffe trees.  Give yourself plenty of time to walk the garden's many loops. I would recommend at least four hours.

I've only been to Jugheads for Sadisco, the goth/industrial night, and I wasn't impressed. Jugheads isn't as much a bar as a series of fences, ramshackle walls and bits of trash. I don't know what the drink prices are like, because I've never felt comfortable enough to have a drink there.  The parking lot is a mess, and I'm surprised there isn't a crash every night. There isn't much room to move, and it's poorly lit. If you do go, try parking in a lot west of the bar, near the Delhi Palace. There's lots of parking there.  During the last Sadisco Fight Club, an amateur brawler was knocked unconscious and couldn't be revived. That resulted in a visit from the cops and paramedics. The bar was shut down, and my $15 cover went to waste.   I likely won't be back.

I first fell in love with George & Dragon during World Cup 2002. On the night Brazil defeated England, the patrons actually lifted the one man with a Brazil jersey into the air and carried him to the back door.  People often think G&D has overpriced drinks. It really doesn't. Last night, I bought $8 rounds of vodka tonic and Smithwick's pints. I don't know how the price was split, exactly, but $4 for either drink is decent.  Monday's No Country Karaoke isn't much different from your average karaoke night, but a few genuinely talented crooners do show up, and the wireless mike makes the whole pub a stage.  G&D's business has slowed because of light-rail construction on Central, but the fun factor still is there. I've never had a bad time. If singing and drinking isn't your thing, pool tables line one side of the pub. Also, a fenced outdoor patio allows smokers to have a puff while keeping their drinks in hand. Bravo.

I was craving sushi on a Saturday, so my girlfriend popped open Yelp to see what was in her neighborhood. We ordered a rainbow roll, Vegas roll and yakisoba noodle with tofu. Everything was terrific and totaled about $30.   Service was fast, despite being busy, and we were very curious about Milky Pepsi, though neither of us was brave enough to order it.

If Henry Rollins' eyewitness account is your only concept of Sky Harbor, you really need to see it for yourself.  I only fly from Terminal 4 (Southwest Airlines), and it's my favorite airport terminal in the United States. I'm always in and out in a flash; the Wi-fi is free, and cute people are all over the place.  The Phoenix metro area is built on convenience and space, and the airport is no exception.   My only complaint is a fairly crappy food selection.

This is THE place to go for rock T-shirts. They have punk, metal, industrial, goth, new wave, classic rock and other genres covered. And the staff is insanely cool.  I visit each time I'm in Arizona, and I buy at least two shirts per visit. Most recently, I snagged Bauhaus, The Smiths and The Pixies.  Need patches? They got 'em. Pins? Yup. Boots? Covered.  Lighters, posters, tapestries, rock fashion accessories and more are all under one roof. And that SMELL, that Shirts 'n' Things smell, is one of a kind. It's the scent of rock'n'roll.

When my family was too short on time for a trip to Barrio Cafe, we slipped into Los Favoritos for some quick tacos, enchiladas and burritos. Nothing on the menu disappointed, and we visited again a few nights later during a late study session.

I'm that guy who's always poo-pooed Gilbert as a place where terrified suburbanites imported restaurant ideas from the big, scary city to a place where they felt safe.   But Liberty Market isn't one of those restaurants. It does things its own way, and it does them well.  Some key takeaways  1. Everything tastes good. Literally every single thing on the menu that I've tried has been amazing.  2. The burger, pizza and fish of the week change (you guessed it) every week. So there's always something new and exciting on the menu.  3. Buy an eclair. I don't even like pastries, and I die for Liberty's eclairs. Buy one for dessert and one to take home.   4. When in doubt, go Italia salad or any pizza. They're just magnificent.  5. Buy the wine. Liberty is really good about having affordable and tasty wines.   6. Expect to pay about $25 per person if you want food and a beverage. It's totally reasonable for the quality you get. If you just want entrees, you can skate away on $15 a person.

Visiting my mom in Chandler, I had a hankering for teriyaki. My mom said Mikado had a great lunch special, so we went.  If your idea of "special" is warm spicy tuna rolls and chicken that tastes like someone made it in a toaster oven, then Mikado is pretty damn special.  I like my teriyaki very saucy, very sweet and a bit charred. No such luck.  I can't think of a single thing they did right.  I suppose the price was OK: $7.95 for teriyaki, white rice, miso soup, a small salad and a four-piece spicy tuna.

Shrimp teriyaki? Sounds risky, but if it's on the menu it should be safe. Right?  Wrong.   The fishy flavor of the shrimp does not play well with the sweetness of teriyaki.   Also, the Diet Pepsi here tastes really awful.

Time Out is like a New York subway train: Every time I step inside, I fall in love with some gorgeous scene girl with cowboy boots and a vintage buttrock shirt.  I love the cushy booths, the reasonable drinks and the jukebox.  I'm not crazy about pool tables, but the joint would look pretty empty without them.

Ted's is one of the few hot dog joints where the hot dogs actually are better than the pricier sausages. But don't get me wrong, everything they serve is good. I first had Ted's when I was 8 years old, and it remains my favorite dog in Arizona. Every weiner is perfectly charred over coals. And the onion rings are battered and wonderful, more like an Awesome Blossom than breaded, frozen fast food rings.

Whenever a Mexican restaurant serves meals on reusable plastic plates, I'm already a fan.  Margaritas are cheap and weak. The service is surly. The food isn't healthy.  But if you want guilty Mexican fare (mini chimis, gobs of cheese, huge burritos) for under $10, get over here.

Whenever I drag friends along to return to my Arizona roots, I take them to Elmer's.  The strips are out of this world. If you haven't had them, imagine chips topped with shredded (not melted) cheeses. Plop on some hot sauce (conveniently offered in ketchup bottles for maximum squeezage) for a heavenly combo.  I highly recommend the mini chimichangas with a huge soda.  Oh, and park around the back.

The food at Persian Room is top-notch, and the naan is to die for, but the service is a bit odd. It may have just been our server, who hovered over the table and touched me a bit too much.  My family of eight individually ordered six different kabob dishes, and the server took it upon himself to present the meals in a "family style" setting. All the kabobs were on one plate, and the rice came in two platters.  It's hard to track if you're getting the right amount of kabobs, and someone who ordered sultani may be getting screwed out of his ratio of barg to koobideh, or maybe a chicken eater doesn't want the juice of red meat on her chicken barg. You get the idea.  If you want to serve it family style, please ask first.  Also, we luckily checked our receipt and noticed we were incorrectly charged for an extra tea and an extra glass of merlot. Upon being informed of the mistake, the server quickly removed it from our bill.  Expect to pay about $30 a person for appetizers and entrees.

The Rogue had two eras, as far as I'm concerned: The Couch Days and Now.  The Couch Days were great. We'd drink cheap beers, listen to rock music and eventually get so tanked we'd have to lean on one another while sinking into the couches and laughing our heads off.  Now the couches are gone, and the crowd skews a little bit younger. But they're fun and looking for a good time. I don't think I ever have left Shake, the Saturday dance party at Rogu,e without plans for an afterparty or makeout session.  As others have said, be sure to park in the neighborhood, because the parking lot is microscopic.

The spicy Singapore noodles with tofu is the bomb. Sure, the noodle bowls are $8, but there's a lot of food in there! And Plaid's tofu is my favorite tofu on earth.  Sandwiches are about $6, and seasonal beers are $2 a pint. Most of the seating is booths, which I really like.  Plus, there's almost always a cute server.

If you ever teach a class on stereotypical Arizona hotel decor, take your students to the Tempe Mission Palms Hotel. It's amazingly cliche.  Also, if you want to get shithammered at an ASU football game and bang a woman you met between the stadium and your hotel without stumbling far, stay here.

Pineapple and pepperoni with extra sauce. I know it sounds weird, but it's a great combination at Spinato's. The sauce is boss, and I can't get over how perfectly chewy and crisp the crust is.  While at Spinato's, I was treated to a display of the restaurant's outstanding service. A table of business diners were upset because one had asked for cheese after receiving a calzone and didn't realize that meant making a whole new calzone. Instead of appreciating the lengths Spinato's will go to provide a fresh, delicious meal, she shrieked, "Can't you just throw some cheese on top?" And her pal was mad because he asked for sweet peppers and then ate his sandwich before the peppers arrived.   To the servers' credit, they comped a few items, boxed what couldn't be waited for and apologized profusely. I wouldn't have handled it so well.  So, for me, Spinato's doesn't compare with Pino's, but we're talking a different style of pizza. I certainly will be back when in Arizona.

One of the best things about moving to Tempe from Chandler was being closer to The Chuck Box. My older cousin and uncle took me there as a treat when I was a child. As a grown-up, I was there almost weekly.  Few things make me happier than scarfing down a perfect burger with a cold Coke, snacking on some fries, sitting on a wooden box and swatting at the occasional fly.  I miss you Chuck Box, and I want a framed portrait of Big Juan for my living room.

Casey Moore's is all about reunions. Any time I'm in Arizona and want to see my old friends, I find them at Casey Moore's.  It's like being the lunchroom in elementary school again, moving table to table and mingling. Seriously good times.  I honestly have never gone to Casey Moore's and not run into someone I know.

Rubio's is pretty pricey for Mexican fast food, but they specialize in seafood. And if there's anything Long John Silvers has taught me, it's not to go cheap on seafood.  Anyway, I'm a big fan of Rubio's fish tacos and mango crispy shrimp tacos. The roasted salsa also is tasty, although the chips could use some work. Rubio's beans flat-out stink.  For a combo of two tacos, chips, beans, salsa and a large drink, expect to pay about $9.

Tott's reminds me of my favorite Chinese eatery in Chicago: Friendship Restaurant.  Everything tastes fresh, and the boxed presentation of to-go foods is top notch.  My favorite menu item, for only $6.25, is the sampler plate. Three spring rolls, four pot stickers and four cheese puffs with dipping sauces come in a box on a bed of lettuce. Everything is perfectly cooked, with a touch of firmness on the pot stickers, cheese puffs with crunchy tips and soft bodies and spring rolls that taste like spring.  No MSG. Pure vegetable oil. Trimmed meats to reduce fat, and an open kitchen so you can watch the cooks.  Easily my favorite fast Chinese in Arizona.

The best Mexican food I ever have eaten. My date said it best, "I've died and gone to Mexican food heaven."  My mom had lamb on special. It was superbly cooked, with one side slightly crisp and the other delightfully tender. Garlic mashed potatoes and perfectly grilled zucchini rounded out her plate.  I had shrimp tacos, which were plump, juice and fresh. The complimentary guacamole made fresh at the table with avocado, cilantro, tomato, pomegranate, salt and pepper put me on another planet.  My cousin always orders the pulled pork torta, which is amazing and gigantic.  And my lady had halibut topped with lobster, shrimp, crab and scallops -- a seafood-lover's dream.  The only low point on the menu is the sangria, which she returned to the server in favor of a glass of quality red wine.   I refuse to visit Phoenix without making a stop at Barrio.

Any good city has places well-suited for kicking off a great night. Cornish Pasty is one of those places.  With so many filling options (meat-and-potatoes for the all-American, East Indian cuisine for the globetrotter, eggplant for the vegetarian), all your friends can find pasties they like. And the $3 Car Bombs are tasty and potent.  As a take-home option, Cornish Pasty offers discounted half-baked pasties you can finish at home. But I prefer to sit at the bar, have a few drinks and watch the cooks prepare pasties from ultra-fresh ingredients.  Note: Seating is limited at this location, so be prepared to wait or go during non-peak hours.

Iguana Mack's is a lot like Guthrie's Tavern in Chicago: drinking mixed with board games. However, Mack's has a Southwestern slant and is geared more toward the college-aged crowd.  Sundays are industry night, and drink specials are determined each hour by spinning a wheel'o'deals. It's a novel concept but becomes annoying when a Girls-Gone-Wild-type announcer yells the drink special over a crappy wireless microphone. And most of the drinks are silly cocktails and beers a 21-year-old would enjoy.  Our server seemed new at her job, coming to the table without knowing the total for our drinks, hovering around and interrupting our conversations.   She even talked to us DURING a round of Scattergories. Don't break my concentration, toots. I play to win.  On a side note, Mack's has TONS of outdoor seating. If the weather's nice, the patio is wonderful. And if it's a bit chilly, the outdoor area is heated by a fireplace and propane burners.

I don't know if it's possible for a place like Skybar to "keep it real," but Thursday nights with DJ Maji get close.  I attended last night, and it uncharacteristically was dead. So I can't speak for the crowd, but Maji spins solid house and finishes off the night with eclectic hip hop, from Lupe Fiasco to De La Soul.  The decor and staff are super sweet, and the outdoor heaters make patio seating comfortable year-round. I didn't buy any drinks, so I missed out on the sticker shock.   Parking was really weird. Plenty of spots were open, but the hotel only offers valet parking. So I parked down the street and walked across two empty lots to reach the club. Ridiculous.  The highlight of my evening was diving into the pillow-piled round sofas with "Kitty," a young lady in a black mini-dress and knee-high boots whose fakies shined through her sheer outfit. I've never gone from pillow fight to debating Hemingway in 60 seconds.

After promising me In-N-Out, my cousin surprised me with a walk to Los Favoritos. He's a regular there and called in our order while we strolled to the restaurant.  The staff totally treated my cousin like a pal, joking with him and teaching us a bit of Spanish.   We had the California carne asada and regular carne asada. The former had cheese in the rolled tortilla and French fries in the the burrito. The latter had just the right amount of guac and meat.   One of my typical complaints about carne asada is most restaurants make it too salty. Los Favoritos' meat is perfectly seasoned and fresh.   The burritos aren't huge, but they do the trick. And the tortilla is chewy and delicious. Refills are free, and Los Favoritos carries two types of hot sauce in squeezy bottles -- just the way I like it.

My aunt bought me two shirts for Nordstrom Rack. I didn't care for them and visited the store to return them for a refund.   I explained the situation and handed the clerk a receipt. She promptly returned the credit to my aunt's credit card.   Hey wait. *I* wanted that money.   So the clerk made some clicking noises with her tongue, tapped the touchscreen, looked around for help, blushed, stared at the receipt and generally wasted time until a manager finally told her to void the transaction.  By the time I received my refund, I was short on time and didn't bother shopping. I did scan the shoe aisle because all shoes with orange tags were on clearance. The problem: None of the shoes on the rack had an orange tag. And Chuck Taylor's at $30? Fugg that.   I wound up spending the money at Shirts'N'Things on some sweet rock T's. WAKOW!

After getting over the sticker shock (and I wasn't paying), I sipped on water and chatted with my cousin for what seemed like an hour.  He wisely ordered a salad, which held us over as the sun set, the seasons changed and my nephew made his way through elementary school.  The Caesar salad had the perfect amount of dressing, quality lettuce and fresh-ground pepper. A small order was enough appetizer for two guys.  The pizza finally arrived, and it was fantastic. We ordered a large white pizza with pepperoni, sun dried tomatoes, onions and sausage. The toppings were perfect, and the crust was divine. Grimaldi's only uses fresh ingredients, and it makes a world of flavor difference.  One factor that annoyed me but pleased my cousin was the constant interruptions by the waitstaff.  "More water?" "Everything OK?" "Anything else?" "How's that pizza working out for you?"  How's the pizza working out for me? The hell?  If you see my water empty, fill it. If I'm not complaining, everything's fine. You can ask me once about that. Don't cut off my dinner conversation with a repetitive interview.  My advice: Call ahead and order your delicious pizza. You can skip the wait, avoid the waitstaff and save some bucks on tip.

The past two times I rented from this location, I was given real clunkers. First was a PT Cruiser that crawled up hills and sounded out-of-breath on highways. The second was a Pontiac G5 with a broken passenger-side window motor, stains on the seat and 33,000 miles on it.  And give yourself plenty of time to pick up and drop off your vehicle, because you'll need it. Dropping off that Pontiac took 35 minutes because only one person was staffing the counter.  But that one person was Kyle, and Kyle is awesome. I watched him handle a long line of customers alone, including such problems as a guy who wanted a car big enough to fit his mom's wheelchair but low enough her her to climb into. And the customer passed on the first five vehicles Kyle offered.   When he finally got to me, Kyle apologized, was very honest and even offered me a discount for the poor service and vehicle I'd endured. I'm writing Enterprise to let the rental company know it has a real gem on its staff.

Based on the spectacular customer service I received at Headquarters, all retailers immediately should stop drug testing. I surprised my girlfriend by taking her to Headquarters to pick out new glass for her birthday. The staff were super helpful and enthusiastic about helping her choose, and they informed us of every discount available.   Since then, I've seen a few of the staffers around town, and they remember my face and always say hello.   Headquarters makes me wish I were a smoker. It's just that terrific an environment.

I typically hate everything in Old Town, but who can hate a Mexican restaurant that's open late, serves a huge variety of drinks, has great and imaginative tacos, can accommodate those who eat clean.  The lean green bowl is black beans, Greek yogurt, roasted veggies, tomatoes and lime quinoa. It's outstanding and even better with shrimp for a few bucks more.  Ahi tuna tacos also are terrific.

Overpriced, underserved and ignorant.  AJ's charges the same prices as The Persian Room, but serves a laughable portion of sub-par food.   The koobideh was too stiff and too salty. The barg (filet mignon) was tolerable. The joojeh kabob (chicken breast) wasn't even seasoned with saffron or citrus. These guys are doing it wrong.  To top it all off, the server suggested I get an extra side of rice because "it's the best part, and our rice servings are kinda small." Dude, rice is cheap. If it's so good and you know it's a small serving, MAKE IT BIGGER. I'm paying $16 for lunch, you can afford another cup of rice.  Anyway, our server admitted never having tried Persian food outside of AJ's, which should have been a huge red flag. He also had a rather dopey, unaffected personality that really didn't add to the experience.  Neither did the light rock radio station playing in the background. Could you buy some Googoosh CDs, please?  With places like The Persian Room and Tasty Kabob, there's no reason to visit AJ's.

Any concerns about the speed of service should be tossed aside. My family went on a Saturday night and quickly were served the best calamari I ever have eaten, outstanding rolls and melt-in-your-mouth sashimi. Our server was outstanding, and a duck even walked over from the lake to say hello (and bit my finger).  My mom, who is allergic to avocados and let the server know it, was given a roll with (you guessed it) avocado in it. But she loves Hon Machi so much she forgave the chef.

I'm not a crazy big fan of mixologist cocktail bars, but SideBar skips the razzle dazzle and just pours classy drinks, even if they have a few more posh ingredients than your average bar. Just don't plan on getting drunk here without a credit card.  I attended for Retro Hi-Fi, which didn't strike me as terribly retro and had a lot fewer dancers than I expected.

I leave Chandler for a few years, and it turns to Scottsdale.  Being a fan of Chandler bars like the Pecos Lounge and ... well ... the Pecos Lounge, I was shocked to see this sqeaky-clean, themed, yuppie bar in a neighborhood that used to mean death for white people.  As my drinking buddy noted, "I know it's an Irish pub, but do they need to beat you over the head with it?" Green backlit alcohol displays, racist comedy on the video screens, Shamrocks and green crap all over the place ... please stop.  Also, I hate when bartenders need refer to a video screen to place my order and give me a total. It was a gin and tonic and a whiskey Coke. You should be able to do that in your head, take my money and let me go have fun.

Notice to restaurant staff: If you screw up and order, just quickly do something to make up for it.  Cornish Pasty prepared a cheesesteak pasty when we asked for a Mediterranean chicken. You know what the server did? She noticed the order was wrong and pre-emptively had the cook make a Mediterranean, then delivered the cheesesteak to our table, free of charge.   That kept everyone in a good mood so we could enjoy our other pasties and buy a few more Kilt Lifters. Everyone wins.  Note: The lamb vindaloo pasty is very spicy, so be prepared. My girlfriend adored the Lovely Bit A Salmon pasty. And don't skip the garlic fries.

I had two very different experiences at Sanctum.   On a Friday, for Faux Show, I had a pretty awful time. The cover was $8, the crowd was too young and obnoxious, and the music was a bore. Despite spending $16 on cover for my and my date plus another $20 on drinks, I left after an hour.  On a Saturday, for Retro and Beyond, I didn't mind the cover charge or drink prices. The crowd was older and wiser. The music was delicious. The bleacher seating allowed my non-dancing friends to enjoy my dancing friends. I didn't sit down the entire night. And the unisex bathroom keeps the crowd moving back to the bar at an awesome pace.  As for drink prices, remember the bartenders all poured super heavy. You get your money's worth.

Disclaimer: Dr. Orona is my sister, but I'll try to forgive her for that.  My girlfriend has suffered from gluten and dairy allergies, and of course she loves breads and cheeses. So when Dr. Orona offered a solution, we stopped in to check it out.  Using sophisticated electronics (not needles in the back), Dr. Orona checked her patient against several common allergens and noted a difference between cow milk and goat milk. She also spotted some surprise allergens affecting my girlfriend's body.  After screening, Dr. Orona prepared a charged vial used to desensitize her patient to the allergens, then prescribed supplements to aid in digestion. The visit was quick, easy and painless.  Weeks after her treatment, my girlfriend reports improved digestion, less sensitivity to gluten and dairy and better overall health.

I made an appointment for a 7 a.m. oil change and checkup on my truck. When I dropped it off, I was told the diagnostic would cost $115 and to expect a call around lunchtime. By noon, I still hadn't heard back, so I called the dealership. My service adviser said he had just heard 20 minutes before that my truck had some issues that hadn't been anticipated and "more things had to be disconnected."  So, four hours for a checkup. No repairs have been performed yet, and I had to call for an update. The rest of the day is on hold. Awful service.

Nothing fancy. Just great noodles and tremendous dumplings fast and at a great price.

I asked co-workers to treat me to CMNH for my birthday and wasn't disappointed. The dumplings weren't vegetarian friendly, but I sampled one, and it was amazing.  Huge portions at great prices.

I loved Chompies when I lived in Tempe, but the Chandler location doesn't seem to serve the same quality with the same attitude.  The service is impersonal. The food is sub-par, from limp bacon to undercooked eggs. I also don't understand the $7.50 price tag for a single Belgian waffle. It wasn't particularly big or tasty.   I'll still keep coming for the sliders and the bakery, but I hope this location someday can match the quality of the Tempe Chompies.

When my niece kept begging to eat here, I had my misgivings. But she was right, Yo Love is fantastic.  Also, this may just be an anomaly, but my girlfriend (who is lactose intolerant) had no problem digesting the frozen yogurt here. Maybe all those cultures in the mix helped.

Sure, the fishtank looks gross and the decor is far more shabby than chic, but nobody comes here for the ambiance. The FOOD, man, the food is incredible. There isn't a bad thing on the menu. The cheese naan is so wrong but SO RIGHT. The chicken tikka masala is on point, and the goat biryani is so tender and flavorful.

I hate chain restaurants. I loathe "pubs" that aren't really pubs, and I'm not a big fan of breastaurants.  But the downtown Tilted Kilt holds a special place in my heart.  See, I'm an fan of U.S. soccer. And once upon a time, nobody cared about U.S. soccer. But Tilted Kilt opened its doors to U.S. soccer fans, put matches on the big screen, and said, "Hey boys, you pound those drums and raise those scarves and get drunk within our four walls."  Because this Tilted Kilt location really does treat you like a friend. Everyone is friendly. And there are real personalities behind that corporate logo.  Some key perks:   FREE PARKING. Park in the CityScape parking structure, and TK will validate your parking pass for up to two hours.  SPEEDY TACOS. When you think "pub," you might not thing "fish tacos," but they seriously are the best thing on the menu. And they come out SUPER fast, sometimes faster than your beer.  KILT LIFTER: Of course TK would serve this local brew. But man, it's good. And it gets you drunk like pow.  TOBY & RJ: The Tilted Kilt managers are absolute gems. They come out and shake your hand. They genuinely want to know if you're having a good experience, and they make sure you do. Classy.  Caveat:   SLIDER CITY isn't actually a city of sliders. In fact, it's just one slider, even though there are several in the photo of Slider City. Just know that when you think, "My, that is an awfully reasonable price for a city of sliders."

Herb 'n Flavors suffers from a lame name and horrible location, but it's close to my apartment and serves exactly the food I'm looking for.   I love when servers know all the ingredients in their dishes and can help me find the right fit for my strict diet.  Our server (Brent, I think?) was terrific and clever. He guided me to the warm lentil and spinach salad, which was delicious, and my date loved her gyro.  This place is the real deal for vegetarians, healthy eaters and sugar-free diets.

With so many decent taquerias in Chandler, differentiating isn't easy. But Senor Taco sets itself apart with tortilla-shell bowls (like a taco salad) and salsa bar that includes roasted peppers.

I was excited to try Which Which because I could save time ordering online and could control ingredients to fit my vegetarian, no-sugar diet. I ordered a tomato and avocado bowlwhich and added an egg for extra protein.   When I arrived, I was happy to see my bowlwhich was ready, and I left the restaurant. But looking down at my bowl, I saw there was no egg. So I stepped back inside and asked for the egg, which the which makers gladly added.  When I returned to my office, I discovered they also forgot the avocado, which is sorta part of an tomato and avocado bowlwhich. And there was a scrap of bacon in the bowl; it had no business being there.

The owner of this Which Wich location was quick to contact me and apologize for the mistake on my meal. She offered me a free replacement bowlwhich of my choosing and a complimentary drink.  On my return visit, I had an outstanding bowlwhich loaded with black bean patty, hummus, dijon mustard, feta cheese, cucumber, tomato, caramlized onions, spinach, lettuce, banana pepper, garlic, salt and pepper. It was made to order and perfectly done.

Huevos rancheros and bottomless coffee for $8! Service was lightning fast and friendly. Newspaper was current. Ingredients were fresh and delicious. Nothing fancy, but the sauce, beans and eggs were all made fresh in house.   Coffee was bland but inoffensive.   Great breakfast before a day of shopping the vintage stores along Seventh Avenue.

Pho Tempe holds the crown as the absolute worst dining experience of my life. Aside from having bland beef pho and a forgettable attempt at banh mi, Pho Tempe was filthy and doomed by poor service.  I called to ask when the restaurant would close on a Monday night, and the man on the phone was impossible to understand. He said something about 9 p.m. He also said something about 10.   Is it open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.? Lobby open till 9 and carryout till 10?  To be safe, I hopped on GrubHub and submitted my order while driving to the restaurant.   When I arrived, I explained I would like to use a Groupon to pay for my order. The woman working at the restaurant, in broken English, told me I couldn't use my Groupon for a carryout order.   That's fine, I told her, we could just save the Groupon for another time.   She told me to just eat the meal there, and all would be OK.  So I sat down and was brought a menu. She asked me to order. I told her I just wanted what I already had ordered on GrubHub. She said to forget about the GrubHub order and just order again.   I asked if the online order would be cancelled. She said yes. So I ordered. And halfway through my meal, out came a second meal in to-go containers.  So there I was, full of food and staring at the same meal packed for later. The woman already had redeemed my Groupon, and she expected payment for the second meal.   Put in a terrible situation by her inability to communicate or find a compromise, I simply tipped well and walked out on the to-go order.  The entire experience was so upsetting, I won't return to Pho Tempe.

Ten minutes for breakfast on the go is a bit long, but the Southern Burrito is worth the wait. And the house blend coffee is solid.

I'd like to review Grilled Addiction's food, but the wait was so long that I never got to eat it. Food trucks are supposed to be fast. Limit the menu, speed up the service. Also, the truck ran out of ice in its first hour of operation. Fail.

FULL DISCLOSURE: I sometimes volunteer at this location.  I've seen the faces of people who visit animal shelters to adopt. They're upset by the loud barking, saddened by the stressed animals and turned off by the prison-like setting.  And that's why Petmatch is so important. It looks like a pet store. Each animal has a comfortable space. The dogs are walked regularly. The staff is friendly. The facilities are clean, and they entire storefront is welcoming.  I hope more shelters and rescue groups follow the revolutionary example set by Petmatch.

If you don't know how to tear apart a lobster or crawfish, this isn't the place to go. If you are on a fancy date, this isn't the place to go. If you value, to any degree, the clothes you are wearing, this isn't the place to go.  So toss on a crappy T-shirt and old jeans before you get down on some amazing boil-in-bag seafood. I highly recommend the lobster, crawfish and king crab legs -- all in trifecta sauce (garlic butter, lemon pepper and Cajun spices).   Angry Crab sells its food at market price and by the pound, so you choose how much you really want to spend. Also, nobody is going to yank that tail off the lobster for you or peel your shrimp. You're going to get  your hands dirty.    Remember to order an appetizer of charred oysters, especially if you like to pile on the garlic.  My date and I had a 1.8 pound lobster, a pound of crawfish and 6 charred oysters for about $50. And the service we received from Michele was phenomenal.

Monster-sized salads, a wide beer selection and friendly bartenders combine with a sharp aesthetic to make this place a suitable Sunday spot. Plus, they show MLS soccer.  For a great salad, try the Second Street Farmers Market Salad with ahi tuna, substituting mozzarella for bleu cheese because bleu cheese is gross.

An independent barcade in Tempe? Yay, right?  Not quite.  Chicago spoiled me with legit barcades, such as Emporium and Logan Arcade. Those stellar establishments offer row after row of vintage pinball and arcade games. Endgame has a few crappy arcade cabinets, zero pinball and a bunch of consoles that basically remind me I could have just stayed home.  The layout is silly, with the gaming areas split clear across the bar, and it just looks like the execution fell far short of the concept.

Ironically, Linger Longer Lounge hosted one of the few dance parties I left early.   I arrived in costume at 9 p.m. after awkwardly squeezing my car into the labyrinth back parking lot. Tongue Tied had advertised no cover till 9 p.m., and the door guy took that very, very seriously.  I don't know if you've ever arrived at a bar/grill at 9 p.m. for a dance party, but it's weird. It's still the dinner crowd (which skewed rather old), and they're looking at you like an alien.  C'mon, door guy, don't get technical about the cover. This isn't a shuttle launch. My watch says 9 p.m. You don't even have a watch.  So after paying cover, I walk into an overcrowded bar with a laughably small dance floor that is SURROUNDED BY DINING BOOTHS. Nothing says, "Let's party," like being the entertainment for boring old farts who just stare.   Several of my friends left because the bar staff was rude. And the single bar for two rooms left people waiting a long time for drinks. I just gave up on that.  Anyway, I decided to call it a night at 11:06 p.m. On the dot.  If you're looking for a bar that serves food, has two rooms, offers live entertainment at actually gets it right, head over to Crescent Ballroom, Valley Bar or Yucca Tap Room.

My co-worker and I, both vegetarians, wanted a quick bite at the office. So, we trotted down to the Queso Good truck in the parking lot.   Big mistake.  Our identical orders (Shroom Zilla) took 30 minutes to make, 20 of which were wasted waiting before being told the truck was out of mushrooms. That would have been handy information when we ordered.  So, we opted for quesadillas with black bean hummus, guacamole, onions and tomato. We would have gone with refried beans, but the staff didn't know if the beans were vegetarian.  Anyway, their first attempt at our vegetarian quesadillas wound up having carne asada. NOPE.  They tried again, but this time but refried beans in them. NOPE.  Finally, I just asked for a cheese and guacamole quesadilla, and I got a sad and flat meal I could have made at home for $1. In all, it cost $7.50 for a little cheese and a microscopic dab of guacamole on a tortilla. And a side of grocery store tortilla chips.  In all, it took more than 45 minutes to get my food. Complete fail.

I normally don't like chain restaurants that serve glamorized fast food (Panera, etc), and I nearly dismissed Cafe Zupas as the same. That would have been a mistake.   Everything here screams "FRESH!" The clam chowder had fresh chunks of potato and veggies. The clam was real clam, not processed cubes of clam product. The salad was mixed fresh by hand right in front of me, the baguette slice was a nice touch and the chocolate-covered strawberry was a classy treat.  Also, I was skeptical about cinnamon anything on my berry salad. Try it. Delicious.

MAD Greens fails to be everything Cafe Zupas is. The salad portions are tiny with very little protein. The sandwiches are uninspired and flat on flavor. The hummus is OK, but everything is overpriced.   The delicious soda fountain with pure-cane sugar soft drinks is the only saving grace, but it's not enough to compensate for a blah lunch.

Leaving Chicago was heartbreaking, but a Portillo's opened in Tempe just weeks after I arrived in Arizona! There aren't very many outside Illinois, so consider yourselves lucky.  When I ate meat, the Italian beef and sausage combo was my go-to.  Now, restricting myself to fish only, I'm super happy with the grilled tuna sandwich.  Seriously, everything on the menu is dynamite.
