As you can probably tell by my other reviews-- I'm one of those, "if you don't have something nice to say....yadda yadda yadda."  But in the spirit of Yelp and actual critical review--- I'll have to suggest steering clear of Benihana; at least until they add more spices and seasonings to their repertoire.  Yes, yes, yes, I should've known.  I'm not much of a 'chain' eater-- but this was my boyfriend's family's pick for his graduation dinner.  It seems to be a family favorite.... which I can't say I really understand.  At all.  I also should mention that this review is based entirely on their only vegetarian dinner option.    I didn't get a look at the bill, but my course was at least over $25 for far less than exemplar fare. Granted, this included a miso soup, small lettuce & carrot salad, tofu appe, egg fried rice, grilled assorted vegetables as the entree, and a scoop of rainbow sorbet for dessert-- but it reaffirms how one should rely on the old standby of quality versus quantity.  And I guess they have to charge that much to keep the Benihana salt mines open....  heaven sakes! The waitress was giggling to herself about how much water I was putting down, but I really can't imagine that this is a rare thing with their preferred method of seasoning; salting the bejesus out of everything from the pasty, ginger-esque dressing on the salad and the soggy, cold, fried tofu appe to the soy-and-butter sopping vegetables.  The only reprieve was the rainbow sorbet and a nice hot green tea closer.    Everyone else at the table had either a meat or seafood course, and were quite satisfied with their meals, so MAYBE it was just the veggie option or MAYBE I'm just a picky foodie or just MAYBE this place really needs the constructive criticism.  And yes, I also realize this place is possibly more about the show than the food...???.... but our chef, though nice, was quite lackluster and didn't have a full cashe of tricks to unveil.  Just the onion volcano.  Sigh.

The long line Sunday morning is truly an indicator of how near and dear LUX coffeebar is to some residents of Phoenix, myself included.  As a people, us Urbanites are not generally prone to, well, waiting-- but these guys tamp out a mean cup that's just THAT good.    I live in Tempe and work in CenPho (@ Practical Art & Sack's Cafe), so I'm usually blipping in and out before work at the end of my commute, but I covet those few hours a week I can sneak away from everything, nestle up in a chic designer chair, and click away on my laptop (which--- outlets galore!-- I can actually plug in!).  On occaision, finding space to perch my bum can be a bit dodgy, and when it's chilly out their ample outdoor seating just isn't all that enticing-- but the times when I've been completely stymied have been few and far between.    I'm sort of a plain Jane and generally just order a non-fat latte (don't ruin their great, roasted on-site coffee with a syrup!) from their friendly, knowledgeable staff. And I have to say, I love the tattoos, piercings, and mod-indie clothes sported by some of the staff-- makes me feel right at home!   Last rave-- they support local artists & sustainable practices. I heart them.

You know when a business starts showing up regularly in your Facebook status updates that it's time to write a review about it.  I love Carly's.  I live about a 200 yards away, as the crow flies, at Holgas Artist's Studios. Generally, my apartment is a wreck so I never want to be there and my food situation is paltry--all cat food---so I spend a lot of time across the street.   I mean, I had recently misplaced my license somewhere between The Roosevelt and Bar Smith a few Fridays ago, and they know me enough to still serve me adult beverages at Carly's.  I have only lived at Holgas since June.  Yes, like I said, there often.  I've always dreamed of owning a coffee shop that serves great artisanal ales as well, with a great bistro-esque menu.... but now I don't have to go through all the hassle of setting one up myself-- Carly's has the market cornered.  With fabulous ingredients like smoked mozzarella, sweet onion relish, and a very tasty hummus & tapenade-- little can go wrong on a sandwich here.  And I'm absolutely addicted to the Orzo side, haven't even tried the Terra chips.  With such craziness as Chimay and Lindeman's on TAP, and serving everything from domestic to import, wine, sangria, bailey's coffees, and specialty drinks like mojitos and margies.... you can punish that liver of yours for all its worth.  (Eh....the orzo soaks it up....)  Great pricing, wi-fi, unintrusive live music, friendly friendly staff, clean... I've never had a problem with anything here.

Since having moved into the NEW & IMPROVED Holgas on 3rd St. & Garfield, I'm discovering all of these phenomenal little house/business ventures, like The Roosevelt, within a stone's throw from my front door.  I'm very much a homebody-- you know, iffy about the concept of 'people'-- so I don't venture too far from either where I live or work. It was an eye-opener when I settled into the Roosevelt Row District having come from South East Tempe.  Many of these places I've seen when I've bopped up for a First Friday-- but lordy be, with the crowds that bow the walls of these businesses those nights, you can understand why I've only peeked through the windows previously.  I meandered over to The Roosevelt after I returned home from a movie at the museum, discovered my cupboards were bare, and lamented that The Lost Leaf doesn't serve food.  I'll admit, I was eyed curiously by both the bartendress and what looked to be a server as I wandered in, wandered around, and tried to assess the situation-- could I go out the back door? Were there servers or was I supposed to order at the bar? Was the long table open for seating?  Was it even part of the bar? What's with the cop? Oy!  Eventually, I just followed the crowd and took the last open seat at the bar next to a couple obviously on a date.  The bartender handed me a menu and directed my attention to the chalkboard with the wine-by-the-glass options.  I ordered a glass of Russian Jack Pinot Noir-- a medium body, very lovely, $9 pinot-- and hemmed and hawed between the Pretzel and the Grilled Cheese & Tomato Soup.  I opted for the latter as I was feeling more 'mealy' than 'snacky'.    While waiting for my food, I absorbed more of my surroundings now that I had my bearings.  Loved the atmosphere.  The lighting, the colors, the black and white movie on TV, the whole trendy somberness of the scheme.  When my food arrived, I'll say, it looked great.  But it had a lot to live up to; in my head I'd built it up quite a bit because Fontina & Grueyere are a couple of my favorite creamy cheeses.  It was good, very good, hit the spot for 'mealy', but it fell just a bit short for me.  The cheeses are very thick, and mellow, and the bread was well, very perfectly grilled panini-- and it just made me wish for an accent flavor, i.e. maybe they could garlic-rub the panini, or throw a fresh herb in there somewhere-- something just to sharpen it up a bit.  The soup was a good solid staple-sort of tomato soup, nice n' creamy.    I'll defintiely be back, but probably just for the wine, maybe a pretzel.  And when I'm able to drop $25 bucks on myself-- or finagle someone else into buying.

So before I moved to manage the new Sack's location on the west side, I had put in my time at the University & Hardy locale-- putting the Cornish Pasty Co. in ridiculously close proximity to myself and the other happy hour enthusiasts I happened to work with.  I still call over to that location to see if anyone there wants to give me an excuse to make the drive across town to meet for a Black Velvet. Hello, my name is Kara... and I'm an unabashed alcoholic.    So if you're following along, when we meet at Pasty Co, I'll already be full from a Sack's sandwich-- but as soon as I smell the baking dough & simmering spices, I'll be perusing the amply stocked vegetarian section of the menu and trying to decide between my three favorites-- The Mexican, The Rosemary Chicken, and the Tikka Masala.  And man alive, you can't drink at a place that's got such a great pub-style atmosphere and not have a great pub-style ale of which they have many.  That's my only complaint about this place-- I am compelled to eat hearty, drink hearty, and be merry until I about burst at the seams.    Managing a kitchen myself, I'm continuously amazed at what they can do with what little space they have!  Their seating area is only a bit longer and wider than their kitchen/prep area which is open to ogle and runs parallel to the grubbing area.  I enjoy sitting at the bar to spy on the process and trying to catch the staff eavesdropping on our loud bar banter.  I love when someone mashing potatoes chuckles at our drunken philosophy sessions.    Parting Tip: As mentioned in other reviews, and their claim to fame (rightly so)-- $3 Irish Car Bombs! (I've seen places charge $6!!!). Oh, and don't forget the Banoffee Pie for dessert.  They make their own whip cream!

After leaving Sack's Cafe at 3:30 (23rd ave & Camelback), I have just enough time to skate over the extra five blocks to Two Hippies Beach House before I have to be to my other place of employment, Practical Art near Central & Camelback.  I ate at THBH two days ago and I've been plotting how many times I can make this excursion each week since. It's SO good.  Managing the cafe, I've learned a lot about food cost margins, and I saw another Yelper mention this in relation to THBH's pricing ($2 loaded tacos!).  And YES, we all need to eat here en masse and buy in BULK so this place can stay profitable enough to feed me!  And why shouldn't we?? This place has delicious food-- all muy fresca!   I ordered two tacos, a Cactus Taco and their daily special-- Artichoke & Black Bean.  For some reason, I half expected them to be in corn tortillas, but I wasn't disappointed when I realized that they actually came in 6" flour tortillas.  These things were stuffed to the gills, so they were a bit messy-- but I managed to very diligently get most of the food into my mouth.  I can accomplish a lot when I'm focused.  I ordered a blackberry lemonade to accompany my tacos, which was sweet, but tasty.  I think this is a great 'schtick' for the Beach House-- lemonade in something like a dozen flavors.  These folks are right on point thematically with everything they've put together here-- I've seen a few places go under for trying to encompass too many modalities.    To tie a bow on it, FINALLY a place that proves buying local and healthy doesn't mean breaking the bank.  Heart these hippies.

What makes me feel better about being another year older?  Perfectly cooked beets in a mustard cream sauce.  Thanks, Tuck Shop.    I had attempted to eat here a few weeks previously, but, unbeknownst to me, it was the Coronado Historic District Neighborhood Festival-- and the regretful host informed us the wait was an hour and a half.  The courteousness of the host, the brief peek I had of the interior that night, and a quick scan of their menu online when we got home secured it as a top choice for my birthday dinner, and by making my reservation for 12 a week in advance, we were in!  Because there were so many of us, we were able to order quite a few dishes and trade around-- a practice that the waiter had greatly encouraged when we ordered by saying the dishes were served 'family-style' and meant for sharing.  For that descriptor, I expected bigger portions, but they turned out to be closer to a sizing I generally prefer-- moderate. The quality was excellent, well-chosen flavor pairings, and everything had that great homemade quality-- nothing came out cookie-cutter style.    I was very interested in the cheese and chorizo stuffed Medjools, but as I'm a vegetarian-- I opted for the Fontina & Pear Panini plate. We even received an interesting tip from our waiter while gorging on the slab of chocolate decadence we ordered for dessert-- bleu cheese to break the palette and offset the sweetness.  Not bad, definitely for the adventurer.  The only thing I would have passed on was the cookie dough ball parting taster.  Their presentation was lovely, four or five little dough balls drizzled in chocolate-- though in the end, I've had better raw cookie dough (I've been spoiled by Wanda's Magical Cookie Dough from Sack's for 6 years now) and it didn't quite live up to the rest of the fare.  But hell-- they were free.
