Authentic Japanese cuisine. Best sushi and sashimi in town, they even have chirashi on the menu and sauteed gobo (burdock root). Sashimi is always fresh, prices are very reasonable. They also have a great lunch special.  I took my four-year-old, who enjoyed the chicken katsu.

I love this restaurant. I've eaten here many times and each time the food and service have been outstanding. I've had brunch here many times after races that end at Tempe Lake; the bottomless mimosas and bellinis are great! And I always take out of town guests here for dinner.   What I like best about this place is everything is made to order, and they make every effort to support local farmers. This is a European restaurant in the heart of Tempe. Fresh food, delicious food.  The 18oz bone in Veal I had at my last visit was one of the best meals I've ever had. The Veal was cooked perfectly at medium-rare (always trust the chef!)  The wine list is impressive. This is the only restaurant I've been able to find Croatian and Slovenian wines on the menu.  I highly recommend ordering the Tauzher Tehran  http://www.indiewineries.com/wine.php?id=238 (red); it goes well with the Veal, is very fruity, but dry, and is divine.   For desert, order the Tiramisu. It's wonderful.

We used Just-InTime Moving to move and they exceeded my expectations.  They showed up on-time the morning of the move, and were ready to work!  They were friendly, courteous and professional.  They are really a great moving company, their prices are reasonable and I would highly recommend them to any of my friends or family members if they needed movers.
