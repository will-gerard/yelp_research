I've frequented Carolinas over the past few years and have had mixed experiences. The last two visits have been subpar and today's experience inspired me to leave this one star review. I decided to stop in for a late carryout dinner at 730pm hoping to get in and out quickly. To my discontent, it took me nearly 25 minutes to get my food (2 tacos, beans and rice). There's absolutely no reason why tacos should take more than 5 min to serve, especially at a restaurant who specializes in them. By the time I got home five min later the food was lukewarm and the chicken tacos severely lacked in flavor. If that wasn't bad enough, I only received about a spoonful of rice with my meal. Not even enough rice to feed a small child. This is not what I was looking forward to after a long day of work. This experience will probably be my last at Carolina's.

awesome food!! might not look like much from the outside but I've been a half dozen times and have never been disappointed. Shrimp tempura is bomb. Teriyaki chicken is amazing! Veggies taste fresh. You can't go wrong at this place.

Absolutely horrible service and extremely dirty. DO NOT EAT HERE. There are better options.

Staff is unprofessional and disorganized when the place is busy. I like small and cozy spots but this place gives a new meaning to the word. It's extremely cramped. Despite all of that the food is good and the drinks are great. Just be prepared for long waits on the weekend and a frustrating staff.

Restaurant and setting is beautiful. Margaritas are huge and tasty. They have great beers on tap including popular Mexican beers. Lastly, the food is terrific and the service is great. Highly recommend this northern Scottsdale gem.

This is a super unique and fun bar in downtown Phoenix with a great selection of local craft brews. I stumbled upon this place a few weeks ago after a Suns game and was pleasantly surprised with the great atmosphere and trendy vibe. They have a great mixture of new and old. Recently went back to have an early dinner on the patio and had another great experience. I highly recommend the sausage platter as an appetizer and definitely do a flight of beer to sample their selection.

The food here is absolutely amazing. One of the best breakfast spots I've ever been to. The omelets are extraordinary and the biscuits and gravy are some of the best I've ever had. The gravy is the good kind with big chunks or sausage in it. The home fries are a must have. Only two knocks on this place is that I'm not a huge fan of their pancakes as they have a lemon flavor to them that some people like but it's not for me. Also, their prices are a bit high for breakfast food. After tax and tip I paid $17 for my food. If you haven't been to this spot yet I highly suggest checking it out. I haven't been there yet for lunch but will soon!

It pains me to leave a one star review at a place with above average food but this rating is well deserved.  I went in with a buddy for a quick bite to eat on Thursday night. We got there around 6:45pm and sat at the bar. The restaurant was about 30% full.   My friend and I sat at the bar for roughly 5-7 minutes before we were acknowledged. Three different girls walked by us multiple times and never said a thing. I thought we would at least be offered a menu. We should have taken this as a sign of things to come.   We ended up ordering beers and an appetizer of 6 hot wings (Coors cans for $2, great deal!). To our dismay, the wings took 45-60 minutes to come out. The waitress apologized to us and said the kitchen was slammed... again the place was about 1/3 of the way full. When the wings finally came out I will have say that they were pretty solid, great flavor, but they only delivered 5 wings to us instead of 6. The waitress apologized for the mishap and brought us out 2 extra wings! Which was pretty comical to us.   I ordered the beef brisket with mac and cheese and a side salad. My friend got a BBQ sandwich and the bun was soggy and falling apart. My beef brisket was good but not good enough to make up for the 1 hour+ wait. By the time we finished eating and got our check it was nearly 8:45pm.   As you can tell, we were extremely disappointed in the quality of service and will most likely not be going back anytime soon. If you decide to go, I hope the experience is better for you bc the food isn't bad.

The food can be good here but they are wildly inconsistent. I come here often because a friend of mine works here and the service from her is great but the rest of the service is far below avg. They have gotten my order wrong several times. The bar area is either way too cold or too hot. It is never a comfortable temperature so dress in layers. Lastly, the place is absolutely boring. They have tons of TVs but could use a Golden Tee or Touch Tunes in the bar area. They desperately need something to liven the place up.

Both locations are great but I absolutely love the new one (Union Hills). I don't think I've had a bad thing on the menu and the service is always spectacular. The 1/2 price wine bottles on Tuesday night is definitely something to take advantage of. I don't write many reviews on Yelp.. only do it if I really like or really hate a place. I couldn't resist writing about how great Times Square is!! Check it out! Highly recommend the Pasta Giovani!!
