I go to LGO any chance I get for breakfast. I love love it!! The coffee, lemonade and the french pancakes (well any of their pancakes) are soooo good.  Besides, you can browse the shop for unique gifts.  I only bought a plant once. But, they have neat things if you ever need it...

I have tried Los Dos Molinos several times.  After my first time I only went per my visitor's request.  The food is so hot you can't eat.  You end up drinking too much and still hungry.   I know and enjoy authentic mexican food. This is NOT mexican food.

The place is small, great for a quick lunch and feels like you're in the city (decoration/mood).  I've had the Oggie and the Royale. It has enough vegetarian choices, too. I like the Veggie Greek. My favorite is the Greek salad!! That dressing! I want the recipe.   The service is always good and the drinks as well.  The Mesa location, just wasn't the same. But it has a patio and it's bigger.

I hired A Wise Move twice in the past three years.  When I sold my home and when I was remodeling. The price is reasonable under $300 for a 3 bedroom house and $85 to deliver all the material for wood floors.  They are prompt, fast, clean, helpful and very careful with my things.

I first went to the Tempe location for vegetarian food. Their greek salad (dressing) is great. I've been trying the pasties and I like them all so far. The wine gravy is different.   The Mesa location has more room and the patio. The church pews add a touch of humor. Better when you're with friends. Cool place for a beer. The service is relaxed and good..try it!

I have been at Panini a few times. The place is clean and family owned. Very simple.  Initially I just needed a cup of coffee and this place was the first one I found in the area. Coffee is similar to the gas station $1 one. But, they have "gyros" and I enjoy Mediterranean food. So, I returned for lunch. The "gyro" I got was not necessarily what I expected but good. The owner (man) was a bit polite, but not friendly. I don't easily jump onto conclusions. But, the woman!!! So unfriendly to me (another customer, spoke their language, was treated great), so I justified it by thinking in my head," ...she doesn't feel comfortable speaking English.". They bake their own bread!!! I went back yet another time!  Their bread is great. Since I was not familiar with Bosnian food, I decided to give it a try again. This time the woman at the register was so unfriendly, I couldn't find an excuse this time. She's plain rude! You would think I'm a masochist! As much as I like the bread, it's not worth it. The feeling I've left with is: "you are not welcomed here".  So, one star for the bread!
