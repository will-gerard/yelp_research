What was I thinking! I knew we should of went by the store and bought a power bar and a water instead...Here is a tip...avoid Denny's go hungry! What the heck me and a work partner called 3 top rated places on Yelp for breakfast and all where closed? BTW the area around the airport not nice...I would get out of the town a little bit.This Denny's is connected to a truck stop so that should of threw up another red flag but the fact that one stomach wall just ate the other we were desperate.   I ordered off of their fresh and fit menu which sounded ok, but the fact that it was drowned in butter was like an oxi moron! The only time Denny's was good to eat at was when I was much younger(not stating my age) and very very late at night. Unfortunately eating some taco bell would be a better choice. Which is also a place I would not want to ever go back to.

Came here for lunch today on a business trip and can't say enough about how awesome this place is and the scenery was...settled right on the golf course and majestic mountain views all around is the setting for this place.  Immediately when you walk up you can smell the food permeating from here and I was immediately looking forward to what was to come. Walking in a very rustic old southwest feeling and an awesome patio setting. We were greeted right away by our server and she went over the daily specials. I personally decided on the BBQ salmon and wow this was cooked perfectly and the sweet potatoes and spaghetti squash were amazing. This a great lunch sized portion and very light. Great hidden little gem and highly recommend you stopping here for lunch or dinner if you are in the area.

Made reservations for my daughter here for her 21st Bday while we were here in Vegas...she wanted Mexican food and based on all the reviews this place looked like a great pick. Drove in and the barely found a parking spot so for me was a good sign for also a good pick as well...dropped the ladies off at the front door and parked the car.   After checking in with my wife things didn't look so positive...they didn't have our table ready which was very frustrating! I gave them hours notice which in my opinion is totally their fault. I will say the staff was  very friendly and very apologetic about the situation. The managers even came out and bought our whole group a round of drinks and brought the kids lemeonades. Finally after a 25 minute wait we did get seated, but again the manager came over and gave us free table side guacamole and again apologized.  At this point no one remembers the wait my daughters could care less and everyone was having a good time. Our waiter Richard made my daughter feel really special and did an awesome job with her birthday. The food here was really good and everyone really enjoyed the atmosphere...would love to come back and enjoy this place again on a trip to Vegas.

Friendly staff 4.5 stars Area 3 stars Condition of store 4.5 strs   Went looking around for some mimosa supplies and was sort of weird to not be able to find champagne right away...had to drive over to here to finally get some supplies. From the looks of it the store has been recently remodeled and in really nice condition. The area a little sketchy but for the area their was nothing else around.

I am not to sure how to begin on rating this place...I was not super excited about eating here in the first place but only agreed to because my daughters whole cheer team already planned a team dinner here. The first experience started off with saying they could only split up 4 different checks? We had 40 people with 13 different families? But oh well we decided to figure it out..the key here this place was dead as a door nail and not making an exception to this was totally ridiculous.   Well we decided to jump into the ordering process which was another nightmare...which again for a totally dead restaurant why would you leave 1 waiter to help out such a huge party leaves a big question on who is managing this place? I can't put all the blame on our server because he really was trying to hustle his butt off but I think the lack of sheer disorganization lead to the ultimate melt down.  Here we go food not coming out with everyone else's food...cold food...my wife's food never got ordered...mix ups with food...the mediocre food at best...then ultimate melt down; paying the bill. This literally took 30+ mins to get figured all because they couldn't put families groups together. In my opinion they brought this pain upon themselves and probably the reason why this restaurant had no customers in it...this was a once and done for me based on customer service, selection , and quality all the way around.

This was a total tourist thing to do but the kids loved doing it....my 14yo just won a national championship and wanted to take some pics so this worked out perfect. Nice clean and well kept up and there was a very nice guy that volunteered to take everyone pics. Did a great job and funny that people don't get a little etiquette of throwing a few dollars at someone for a gesture.

I went here last night for a holiday dinner and hadn't heard much about this place but my boss had heard about it through word of mouth. Wow...I am sure glad we did! This was by far the best steak I have ever had. The filet was cooked so perfectly and so tender that you literally could cut it with a fork. But my dinner started off with the highly recommended crab caked and man am I glad I did. I am not sure if there was any filling used in these cakes because they were just stuffed full of crab...amazing!   Lastly the service here has got to be some of if not the best service I have ever received ...absolutely outstanding. The prices are a little high but you are paying for the atmosphere and a nice steak. This is located in the newly remodeled Golden Nugget which is very nice done.  If you are looking for an awesome steak then this is.

My family and I went here on a trip to Vegas and based on some serious good reviews and recommendations had to try it out....hands down best burger I have ever had! We all got a little something different but I decided on the Ronin medium rare holy cow this was awesome! the wagyu literally melts in your mouth and the fresh veggies just are a nice added touch My wife got the ....then the absolute topper was the chili oxtail fries holy cow the best fries ever. I didnt tell the kids what they where eating at first and then they were a little weirded out, but still thought that these where the best chili fries they had ever had...  The day we where there it was packed but didn't set us back from getting in quickly for a party of 10 and fast service...waitress was so nice and on point. The dont have a ton of beers on tap, but decent enough amount to select from...but did have a great drink menu with some nice choices but not this time. I am not a huge fan of Vegas but next time I will be back to conquer another one of these burgers.

Took the family here on a recent trip to Vegas and desperately wanted to get out of the downtown areas scene of food. Looked this place up on Yelp for favorite bfast spots and saw all the great reviews. All I can say is I am glad we stopped in. This place is tucked into a strip mall which I could care less about. The scenery inside is very eclectic and relaxing. I was more excited about the food!My only suggestion is if you come on a Sunday is come early...we had to wait about 30 mins for a table which was ok because we were not in a hurry. Once seated we ere greeted by a very friendly waitress who suggested a hot pot of french press coffee for the table which was delicious! The menu is packed full of great selections, but they specialize in steak so I decided to get the steak house omelet. It was pretty good, but not the best steak I have had so not judging it off the Ruth's Chris steak quality. My daughter ordered this 2 fisted bagel sandwich filled full of eggs, bacon, ham and homemade sausage and it was killer! I was overall very impressed by this restaurant and most importantly the exceptional service. All the waitresses wear pajamas which my daughters thought were fun. I will definitely be back to this place when in Vegas time permitting....

This place is all its cracked up to be! We looked up best BBQ in Vegas and after some debate/argument we agreed to eat here. Rolling up you might want to turn around, but dont! This place is the real deal! The inside is not that fancy, but who cares right as long as the food is legit. I would pride myslef as a BBQ snob and this joint hit all the marks. I walked up ordered the 3 meat combo with pulled pork, tri tip and ribs. Couldn't decide on the sides so just ordered some extras like okra, cole slaw, waffle fries and potato salad and boy was that a mistake afterwards. I needed to be wheeled out! This has to be one of the best BBQ joints I have been to outside the rib cook off in Reno and this place has every right to stand off to any National Rib Champion. What sealed the deal for me was the owner and his customer service. This guy was hustling all over the restaurant checking on tables making sure everyone had what they needed. They missed a side off our order and I offered to pay for it and he refused. At another table someone asked how good something was on the menu he brought them out a sample! This doesn't happen in most places today or the level of customer service.  Then to top it off we meet this nice family while we are eating and they talk us into sampling their banana pudding desert. At first I was like no way I to full then my daughters almost refused to leave before trying so I gave in. This thing put me over the edge but wow was it good! similar to ice cream pudding only fills the cracks when your full...well worth trying or taking some home. This is a must when your in Vegas!

In Vegas this past weekend and would much rather eat off the strip at locals places and super glad we stumbled upon this place based on Yelp reviews. First off if you are looking for table service and white linen this isn't it, but if your looking for fresh food and some pretty reasonable prices then this is it. They have a great menu with lots of choices from breakfast items, lunch and dinner possibilities as well.   I decided to split the Ahi sliders with a couple scoops of the black bean corn salad on the side...my daughters got the breakfast bowl and my other ones got the turkey sandwich. All of them equally sad this was one of the better lunches they have had in a long time.  All the ingredients were so fresh plus they have organic and gluten free options as well. For us we went all gluten LOL but enjoyed every bite of this meal...the service was also very good and the older lady working here was very nice and came out and ensured everything with our meal was fine. Glad we found this spot and would highly recommend you do as well.

Experience here today was nothing but 5 star from service, food and experience...we were at the Venetian for the wax museum and looking for a place to eat. So went to my go to Yelp friends and saw all the great review and pics and made a reservation.  Glad we did because when we walked up there is a convention going on and they were on a 1+ hour waiting list. When we walked in immediately got seated and with a very friendly set of hostesses.   Upon being seated our server Tracy came over to our table and greeted us and answered any questioned we had. He was awesome throughout the entire time we were here and his sense of humor made this the extra bonus. We had such a tough time deciding on lunch choices because everything sounded so good...but my wife and I split the fried chicken biscuits and ham biscuits. My daughters got the open faced chicken salad salad sandwich and the crispy bird. Everything was so delicious, but we all decided to take some bites/tastes of everyone's and share. My personal favorite was the fried chicken biscuit...so delicate and moist the biscuits and the chicken wow! This is a top choice in Vegas and would go back to try more of the southern delicacies.

I am going to give this place the benefit here being new and they are still trying to get their bearings....came here last night for dinner and it took a few minutes to get waited on but when the manager recognized that he immediately took over apologized and told me he would take personally responsibility for me the rest of my visit. Can't fault a place after that for taking ownership...I ordered the single with all the veggies and added bacon, their special sauce and a fried egg with a side of onion rings. This burger came out perfect! The egg was cooked perfect and on the first bite all the yolk oozed out and it was a mess just like I wanted. It was like breakfast in between 2 buns. The onions rings as well were a great addition plus I thought you can get fries anytime and these were super good....sorry to see they are getting some tough reviews because the layout of this place is great with tons of outdoor seating and and tvs everywhere to not miss any game. Great spot to grab a beer and a burger and for those of you that don't like beef they have chicken, turkey and meatless options as well..
