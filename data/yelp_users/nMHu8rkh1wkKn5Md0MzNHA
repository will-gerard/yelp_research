First time at Majerle's with three others. We went before the Rattlers playoff game but after a D-Backs game, so it was really hopping in there. Got seated right away though.   We were seated in the back room and although our server was pleasant, it lengthened our service time considerably.  Our daughter ordered the salad special. It had bountiful toppings and the right amount of dressing. Her husband got the Rojo Diablo sandwich. He said it was 'stringy' and didn't finish it. My wife ordered a burger and asked that it be wrapped in romaine for a 'lettuce bun'. She got a burger sitting on top if green leaf lettuce. I got the All-Star burger. It was good but overcooked by two levels.   The fries and sweet potato fries were good, as was the selection of drinks. All told, for three sandwiches, a salad and six beers it totaled $85. Too expensive for the quality but they charge a lot due to location.   Thunder Dan better get back to his restaurant and read the reviews. I may not be back.

First time at Welcome Diner. Really good looking menu but the execution really failed.   I arrived at 7:30 on a Friday night with my daughter and her husband. We were 15th in line yet didn't get a table for an hour. With one window taking all of the orders, it was painfully slow.   Our food didn't arrive for another 40 minutes. Yes, an hour and forty total. Brutal. I ordered a burger with poutine fries as a side, along with water. My daughter got the fried green tomato sandwich and water while her husband got the jambalaya and a coke.  After ordering you have to 'fight' for a table, which are few. We sat with two other couples at the family style seating.   My burger was good but the fries were awful. I'd never had poutine before but it was cold. I grabbed my first fry and got a mass of 15 fries welded together. Poorly done. The fried green tomato sandwich was another fail, as the toast was thick, hard and cold. She ended up eating it open faced. The jambalaya was okay.   Service was non-existent so we were ignored.   I may try Welcome Diner again, based on the clever menu but I am hesitant.

Lunch at Honey Bears BBQ today. Arrived at 11:15 with four parties seated and three in line in front of me - good sign.   I ordered the BBQ pork, hot link, a side of slaw and a drink. He changed it to the # 1 value meal to save me money but it still came to $10.28.   Meal arrived in about 4 minutes and everything was hot but I was disappointed in most of it. Come slaw first: slaw was tangy, perfect spice and mayo level. Definitely would order again.   The pork and link came together in a HB bun. I got 2-3 ounces of pork and a three-inch link. Decent flavor but for $10, I should get more than 2-3 oz.  The link was good. It had good snap, excellent spice but just not much of it.  The meal came with a pint of BBQ sauce which was unexpected. The sauce had a slight amount of spice but was so sweet I couldn't put much on the Sammie. I suppose when you're called Honey BBQ, you make sweet sauce.   Around the corner is Hap's BBQ which I thought was better but Famous Dave's blows them both out with flavor and value.

First time at Szechuan Palace, after reading Yelp reviews. Ordered to go and took it back to work for myself and coworker.   He ordered the Szechuan shrimp lunch special and I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken Lunch special. Both came with choice of soups, rices and a salad.   The Szechuan Shrimp was well received but he said "I wish it had more shrimp". Don't we all?  The Kung Pao Chicken was good, with plenty of sauce and chicken. I actually wanted more peanuts. The rice, soup and egg roll were all good but the salad was a waste of time. I think they were making the Americans happy with a salad but I don't like ranch dressing.   I will try it again, mostly because I meant to order General Tsao's Chicken. I know, dumb.

First time at this Chipotle. After reading so many Yelp reviews about the long line, I decided to order ahead online. Thank you Yelpers, great advice.   Parking was tricky. Had to park at the bank but not a long walk. As I walked in, I bumped into the back of the line. There were seriously about 30-35 in line. I was afraid, after reading a couple of reviews, that my order wouldn't be ready but, lo, there it was, all bagged up.  I ordered a barbacoa bowl with guacamole and extra cheese. My coworker had ordered a chicken bowl and a side of chips. It worked to about $9 each. Sounds steep but the portions are big. Really big.  My bowl was full of meat, guacamole and cheese even though I asked for no lettuce. The meat was hot, juicy, seasoned well and held good flavor.   I recommend this location to anyone BUT, order ahead. They opened at 11, I got there at 11:15 and it was packed!

First time at Boston Market. Needed a big meal for my crew who had to work on Easter and then decided to get one for my family so no one would have to cook.   I arrived around 4:30 on a Sunday. I ordered a family meal for five and a family meal for six. They each came to about $45 since I added a pie for the five-meal.   There were lots of options available so I chose to get chicken and turkey for one and meatloaf and turkey for the other. The sides were all good choices but I settled for Mac n Cheese, Steamed Veggies, Mashed Potatoes with Gravy and Sweet Corn.  The chicken was fork-tender, seasoned properly and it nearly fell off the bone. The turkey was also very tender, juicy and flavorful.   It was an excellent meal and I highly recommend Boston Market.

First time at Dragon Bowl. Killing time before meeting friends so I thought I'd grab a lunch special. I was seated right away and offered my drink selection. There were four other parties but one was a table of 12. The two servers were hopping, trying to keep up.   The server took my order right away: Orange Chicken Special which comes with soup, fried egg roll, two wontons, rice and the entree, for $6.35  The Hot and Sour soup was very good. Very hearty with lots of veggies. The Egg Roll was actually very good. Crispy shell, fresh veggies and good flavor. The Fried Rice was sad. No flavor even tho it was fried. The Wontons were seriously over cooked. The Orange Chicken was also lacking. It had pronounced orange notes and a little heat but the breading was terrible: glossy and flavorless.   Their friendly staff and cheap prices will get them thru but this guy won't be back.

First time at Cousins despite being within one mile for six years.   Tried the Chipotle Cheesesteak on jalapeño cheese bread. It came with thinly sliced beef, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onion, chipotle mayo and hot pepper relish. It arrived on a soft roll, which is always dicey for take-away.   I normally don't get all the healthy stuff (lettuce, toms or onions) but I forgot to ask about it. It was really good!  The beef was tender and juicy, the spices were spot-on and the veggies offered nice contrast.   I would've preferred a bit of up-sell, since I had never been there. The cashier seemed to want to be done with me tho so I just got the sandwich.   I will try it again, possibly with other choices next time.  I recommend the Chipotle Cheesesteak.

First time at Hap's for lunch today. Arrived at 11:20 on a Wednesday and it was empty-a little auspicious. More came after I ordered, so I was relieved.    Ordered a combo with pulled pork, hot link, cole slaw and choice of chips. It also came with a small side of BBQ sauce.   The pulled pork was good. Nice flavor but didn't get much smoke flavor-don't know what wood they use. The hot link was disappointing. No 'snap' at all and next to zero flavor. Too bad. The slaw was very forgettable. It was absolutely drenched in mayonnaise and I couldn't taste the cabbage at all. I will try potato salad next time. They offer Dirty Potato Chips brand chips, which is a good choice. I got the jalapeño chips.   I will try Hap's again but will avoid the hot link and slaw.

First time at Poncho's tonight. The four of us arrived around 5PM on a Sunday and it was packed. Waited 20 minutes but got a nice table in the 'living room' (Isabel used her house as a restaurant.)   We ordered drinks and got chips and salsa while we perused the menu. Lots of choices but I went with El Crudo Burro.  My wife ordered the shredded beef tacos. Our daughter got the shredded beef enchiladas and her beau ordered the chimichanga platter.   The El Crudo Burro: excellent. It's juicy machaca beef with a thin, light, and tasty green tomatillo sauce. It is wrapped into a flour tortilla, then topped with red enchilada sauce and melted cheese with rice on the side. Perfecto!  Everyone was happy with their dishes (my wife said her hard shell tacos had a hard shell-whatever.   Will definitely go back. Yum!

Time for an update. We've been to Poncho's about five times now. The only disappointment was when we did the take-out window: got several tacos that were way over cooked.   Tonight we arrived at 6:10 PM on a Wednesday. They had four parties in line, as usual. We waited 12 mins.   My wife ordered #18 which was two Shredded Beef Tacos, beans and rice. I ordered #11, a Relleno, Green Chili Corn Tamale and a Cheese Enchilada. We added two margaritas for a $30 tab before tip.   The #18 was very good. The beef had good flavor. The rice and beans: outstanding. I don't know if it's all scratch made but it sure tasted like it was. My #11 was very good. I love onions and the sauce was very heavy with onions. The Tamale was savory and huge. The enchilada was small but I still couldn't finish it. I haven't had a lot of rellenos so I'm not sure how it compared to others.   Our server was attentive on a busy night, so ole there!  Still highly recommended.

Came here for a checkup for the cat. We waited in the lobby for about 15 mins. We had the only cat but fortunately all the dogs behaved.   We received outstanding service. The intake process was efficient and friendly. The vet was professional yet caring and seemed as much interested in our needs as his. It was a refreshing change from the usual antiseptic approach.   I highly recommend SouthSide Animal Hospital for your pet needs.

First time at Farm at South Mountain. What a hidden gem!  Beautiful gardens, shops, restaurants and mini-community.   Our table (all the tables) was set on a shaded patio with gorgeous views of the naturally-landscaped gardens. My wife ordered the American Breakfast, while I had the Morning Glory Spinach Benedict.  The drinks were self serve.   Our meal arrived in five minutes. She got two eggs, sausage, skillet potatoes and a buttermilk biscuit. The eggs were cooked perfectly, along with the crisp/soft potatoes. My plate had toasted muffins, cooked spinach, loads of farm ham, poached eggs with loads of hollandaise, plus the same yummy potatoes.   The meal was excellent. A little pricey ($33 for the two meals and two drinks, plus tip) but absolutely worth it. The service was outstanding and the view: all five stars.   This was one of the best breakfasts I've had in my LIFE, considering the whole package.   Get here!  They close for summer.

Haven't been to this Good Egg in months. Had brunch with my sweetie on a Friday.   We were seated quickly and offered inside or out. Our server greeted us within five minutes and offered menus and coffee. The service slowed a bit after that but it was rather busy so it was okay.   My wife ordered the special: a chorizo scramble with poblanos, onions, cheese and potatoes, plus coffee. I ordered the Eggs Benedict, juice and a side of crispy bacon.   The coffee and juice arrived about ten minutes later, which pleased my wife since she was cold. Brunch arrived shortly after.   The scramble was disappointing because it was just a muddle. I know a scramble is a mixture of ingredients but this one really didn't sing. None of the ingredients took center stage.   Mine was very good, except for the slightly undercooked potatoes. The bacon was crispy as requested, the English muffin was toasty, there was plenty of hollandaise sauce (although somewhat tame flavors) and the egg was cooked to perfection.   We've had Good Egg before and we will again, hopefully with better results.

First time here. 11:30 on a Tuesday morning and it's only 1/4 full. Where is everyone? Sat by the drive thru window and that line was busy and crawling. Too bad. Maybe that's where everyone is? Ordered the Angus beef and cheese on jalapeño cheddar bread. It arrived in 7 mins. Bread was fresh (toasted), produce crisp and the meat was heated-all good. Not as much meat as, say, Port of Subs. Tasted good tho. Good table side hot sauce. Gave it a nice kick. Good touch guys.  I recommend the beef and cheese sandwich. It was tasty and filling.

I was finally able to drop in Aloha Kitchen today with my daughter and her Hawaiian boyfriend and we weren't disappointed.   The restaurant is little more than a little cafe but we went for the food, not ambiance. After perusing the menu over, I decided to get a mixed plate, which had Bulgolgi (they called it Bulkolgi), chicken katsu, sweet rice and choice of salad. I wanted to try the 'creamy tropical salad dressing' on the green salad, so my daughter and her beau went with the macaroni and potato salad. She ordered the charbroiled salmon but he, being Hawaiian, had to custom order and made a custom mixed plate of teriyaki chicken and J. R. Special. AK happily complied.   Our lunches arrived in 12 minutes, hot from the fryer/char grill/flattop. The plates were literally overflowing with food. My katsu and Bulgolgi were excellent. The katsu was crunchy on the outside but oh so tender on the inside. I was worried that my Bulgolgi would be dry but it was tender and juicy as could be. The sweet rice was, well, sweet rice but good! I tried the entrees from the other plates and they were outstanding as well.   The Mac/potato salad was good but the green salad was just so so.   The owner stopped by our table to ask about our meals and we offered him a seat so he could tell us about the prep. AK makes all of their marinades, sauces and garnishes by hand. The only bottled products are the condiments offered at the condiment station, plus the soft drinks.  He stopped by later as we were finishing to check on our satisfaction. For those who gave negative feedback for service, I think AK has been listening.   We will definitely return but with bigger appetites. Had to leave half my rice behind :-(

Hadn't been to this Denny's since I moved from Chandler five years ago. Close to the hospital for a lite bite after outpatient.   We were seated fairly quickly but our server took quite a while to come see us.    We ordered an All American Slam and coffee plus a Club Sandwich. No frills, just easy, American food. The bill came to $22.56. Really?  $11 each?  Service was very poor. The dude in the headband was full of 'I'll be right there' but we'd wait a while for him to return. He only had three other guests. My water never got refilled despite his two promises to fill it.   Sorry to see this Denny's lose the homey feel.  Prices were up (same everywhere tho) quality stayed level but with horrible service, you can't turn profits.

Haven't been to this Good Egg since I moved across the valley 4 years ago.   My wife and I arrived at 11 on a Saturday morning and there was a 15 min wait, so we took counter seats. Our server greeted us within five mins.   My wife ordered the Good Egg Traditional, with two eggs, potatoes, three fat sausages and toast plus she added coffee. I got the Good Egg Benedict, which came with potatoes plus I got a small juice. It came to $25.11 plus tip.   Our meal arrived in about 12 minutes. Both were cooked perfectly, with plenty of hollandaise on mine. We really didn't need or want to change anything. It was just what we were expecting for a diner breakfast and we left full, satisfied and smiling.   I recommend the Good Egg to anyone wanting a hearty breakfast.

We performed a lot of research for our backyard upgrade. We chose Cal Pools due to the ratings they had received. What a mistake.   Our designer, DJ, was the first issue. He had very poor communication, to the point that I usually had to call him 2-3 times to get simple questions answered. His design skills were good but his follow up was awful. Eventually he scheduled a walk thru on our property to assure his design would work. My wife took a day off work but DJ no-show, no-called her. After I called him three times over that week, he meekly responded that he went to his daughter's basketball game instead.   Since we liked the design, I went into Cal Pools and asked for the manager, who assigned us a new designer. Better communication from there but still not to par.   During construction, they were right on time to pick up the installment checks but as far as staying on schedule?  Not even. We were scheduled to complete March 1. They finished July 3. My 'walk thru' was only 10 mins, even tho we had 7 valves for the pool. They also had to come out for repairs 14 times. Not kidding. 14.   We had them design our entire yard but we were not allowed to pick out our plants. We ended up replacing seven of them. Also, weeds have sprouted EVERYWHERE they planted, so obviously the weeds came with the plants. It's been a nightmare trying to eradicate them.    Cal Pools was one of our worst decisions we've made.

First time at this YC's in Tempe. I've been to a couple others in the valley with mixed success. This location seemed different, in a good way.   The hostess asked if I'd been there before, to which I said: 'No'. She explains how a buffet works and then went thru an example meal with me. Very nice service.   As I made my way thru the line, what she had said made perfect sense. This location offered small sheets of paper to 'squash down' the bowl, so you can fit more. Never saw that at the other locations.   The meats were frozen but shaved thin so they cook up on the hot table. You the fill your bowl with whatever you can fit, sauce it to taste and then hand it to the cook, who pours it all out onto his hot table, cooks it and then returns it to you in a fresh bowl.  They offered chopped nuts for finish, something the other locations didn't have. The entire staff was helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. The spicy beef soup was okay but I would've liked to add some vinegar. Very good meal tho.   The overall experience and value at YC's was excellent and I would highly recommend this location.

First time at Schlotzsky's, not too bad!  Service could've been better, for sure. My order taker/cashier didn't know how to run the register, which is bad during the lunch rush. He had to call for help, even tho I ordered a standard item off the menu.   I got the Bacon Beefy Smoky Cheesy sandwich and a drink. Nothing too tough, right? Took about 8 minutes to input it-I nearly walked out.   Glad I didn't tho cuz the BBSC is tasty!  Very juicy roast beef and bacon on your choice of bun with smoked cheddar cheese and chipotle mayo. I got the jalapeño cheddar bun.   I will try it again when I have more time and patience.

First time at Lolo's Chicken and Waffles. Absolutely not my last!  I arrived at 6 on a Tuesday night and it was very busy. Got my table and scanned the huge menu. Settled on the server's recommendation: the Soulfood Platter. It came with several options so I chose three pieces of fried chicken, cornbread and two sides (I chose Mac N Cheese plus Collard Greens)  I added an iced tea for a total of $20.04 plus tip.   My dinner arrived in about 8-10 mins. The pressure-cooked chicken was hot, crispy, juicy, seasoned well and cooked perfectly. The cornbread was okay. The corn kernels added a nice touch but honey would've made it better. The Mac was okay. It needed toasted bread crumbs for finish. Nice and creamy tho. Never had collard greens before-they were excellent. Kinda like if spinach and cabbage had a baby. They add bacon and red pepper flakes here (not much tho), so it had a good smoky flavor.   The service was exceptional and I had no qualms over any part of the meal.   I highly recommend Lolo's for a filling, tasty southern  dinner!

Been to Kay's before and I thought I had reviewed it. We arrived at 11 on a Saturday and it was busy but not full. The cashier/hostess (Kay) was overwhelmed with the two parties going out so she gruffly waved at a table and grunted, so we sat down.   Our server offered us menus 10 MINUTES LATER. Once we got our drinks, they were mostly empty for the rest of the meal.   The meal: I ordered biscuits and gravy with a side of corned beef hash. My son in law got an omelette. The biscuits were fine but the gravy was pretty bad. They needed to cook it a lot longer cuz it had a raw flour taste. Could've used some sausage in there too!  The hash was excellent.   Poor gravy and awful service: I don't see the need to come back. Too bad cuz it's closer to home. Guess I'll head back to downtown. Sigh.

Had a better visit today with my daughter. We arrived for lunch around 1:00 PM and it was 3/4 full, showing that Da Vang is popular.   We were seated promptly with menus and ice water arriving shortly. Drink orders were taken and the extensive menu perused. My daughter ordered her usual: Pho with brisket and Spring Rolls with BBQ pork. I ordered the Noodles with shrimp, crab and fish meatball (#29).   My daughter dove into her Pho with abandon. I've had it before and, to me, the broth was bland.  She said it was fine but added hoisin, chili paste, Thai basil and bean sprouts so it seemed blasé to me. The spring rolls were excellent. Very plump, colorful, crunchy vegetables and fresh.   My dish was good and I would order it again. There was just the right amount of Bok Choi to make it a good accompaniment, the noodles were soft but not mushy and there was plenty of tasty protein.   I really wanted some sort of fried noodle dish, similar to Thai Pad Thai or Chinese Chow Mien but the service was still a bit lacking and didn't offer much help so I got #29.

Costco is, IMO, the best big-box store. The selection is abundant, they are clean, the associates are friendly and the prices are competitive.   Costco meats, bakery, seafood show and samples all deserve a shout out. They make sure that they rotate product and product lines as well.

Ordered delivery for 15 today. Ordering process was efficient and painless. Good service there.   The food arrived right on time. I ordered: two pepperoni pizzas, one pomodoro pizza, one combo and one cheese pizza. I also got three-two liter bottles of soft drinks and two extra dippers. The total was $97 plus tip. Not bad for feeding 15 hungry guys.   The pizzas had good sauce, which was seasoned well. The cheese was bountiful and the meats/veggies were fresh. The dippers were prepackaged packets and not worth the extra charge. They were ignored by the crew.   I would recommend Sardella's for a group lunch.

Return to FBD, but eating in this time. 11:45 on a Friday and there were only two people. Hmm. More arrived after I ordered. Ordered a 12" Cheesesteak with chips and drink for about $13. They have a decent variety of chips and a plethora of drinks to choose from.   My cheesesteak hit the window in 6 minutes. It was comprised of two 6" sandwiches which was weird. It was, however, good bread, a few onions, plenty of meat, but very sparse on the cheese. For a cheesesteak, you'd think it'd have more cheese than an average sandwich. Next time I guess I'll get extra cheese.   Overall it was a good meal. Filling, about the right price and most importantly, it tasted great.

First time at this Wendy's.   Tried the Bacon N Bleu for the first time too. The burger, with a thick patty, bleu crumbles and spread, fresh tomato, bright greens, pretzel bun and lots of bacon, sounded good.   When I opened the 'box' I found tomatoes and greens all over the inside, the patty and bacon halfway off the bun and the bleu spread everywhere. It appears the cook was going thru the motions and literally tossed everything in.   Not sure if this was normal but I won't be ordering at that restaurant anymore.

AC went out on July Fourth. We had a big group coming over for a BBQ and it was 110 outside.   I called our warranty folks and they put me in touch with Chas Roberts, who called me within 10 minutes to say the tech was scheduled.   Joe arrived about two hours later. He explained what he was doing all along the way and kept us updated. He was professional, efficient and very knowledgeable.   I highly recommend Chas Roberts for your chilling needs!  They saved the day.

Hadn't been to RWB in several months, celebrating my birthday with the Mrs.   Got a table right away on a Saturday at 7:00 PM. Amazing!  Server greeted us promptly and offered the specials menu.   My wife ordered a glass of wine, Beef & Reef with a side salad and baked potato. I over ordered, knowing the value of leftovers. I got a Papago Brewery Orange Blossom beer, Onion Soup, Wings and a BYO Pizza.   The Beef and Reef was good. Cooked just right and seasoned properly.  The Onion Soup was outstanding. Not too salty, oozing mozzarella cheese and a big French bread crouton. The pizza and wings were good, not great. I told my wife that I could find better pizza at a pizza place and better wings at a wing place but they were good for a sit down restaurant.   Our waiter then remembered our drinks and brought them, apologizing. The beer was excellent and a great compliment to the wings and pizza.   Overall, good dinner with a couple of slips.

I've been eating Port of Subs since 1977 - seriously. They have never let me down for a quality sandwich, pleasant service and good price.   I've been to Subway, Jimmy John's, Jason's Deli, Firehouse, Jersey Mike's and all the rest. Port of Subs slices the meat to order and piles on the toppings.   I recommend the hot pastrami or the number one which are my usual go-to sandwiches. Give them a try, you will not be disappointed.

I've been to Faires across the land and the AZ Faire is the finest. The staff is wonderful, the parking is organized (and free, thanks to Fry's) and the committee is always looking for new vendors.   I noticed several new vendors, along with some of my old faves, which adds to the experience.   Unfortunately my wife didn't hydrate well and nearly fainted today. We were in the back of the Faire but the medic team was quick to respond, thorough in their assessment and comforting in their care. They transported her to the first aid station near the front of the Faire and hydrated her.   Thanks AZ Renaissance Faire for continued support of quality!

First time at this Jack in the Box. Came at 11 AM and there was one person eating. Hmm, something wrong with this one?  I waited at the counter for four minutes before the harried manager said hello. I ordered the Hell-a-peno burger and a small curly fry. The burger confused him, I guess because it normally comes in a meal. I asked him if I could order it that way but he just looked down at his register and typed a bunch of codes, then without looking up, said: "What else?"  Had to wait 12 minutes for a burger and fries. Not good service there either.   The burger was good. It had jalapeños on it along with 3-4 jalapeño poppers and some nacho cheese sauce. Good burger but not a to-go item. Too messy.   The fries had been sitting in the warmer since before I arrived so they were very tepid.   Hopefully they will improve soon, since it's so close to work.

Jack-in-the-Box part two. Arrived at 12:05 PM and there were 11 cars in the drive thru, so I parked and walked in. Eight people waiting for their orders and two in line.   The manager, again, taking orders. As I walked to the counter, my shoes stuck to the floor. Nasty!  I ordered two burgers and two fries (a coworker was with me) and my order arrived in 15 minutes. So much for 'fast' food.   As I'm waiting, the manager yells out "Okay, no more breaks or lunches for anyone!".  Not professional.   On to the food: tough to screw up fries but they sat for 10 minutes waiting for the burgers. Too bad.   The burgers were okay but mine had three jalapeños on it, which was very disappointing. The other burger had plenty.   I would drive further to another Jack-in-the-Box if I were you. These guys are way too inconsistent.

Hadn't been to this Macayo's in years. First off, the salsa. Looks authentic but really thin. A gluten free menu is a nice option tho.  Waiter did a nice up-sell on the Cuervo margarita, which I got. He did fail to ask if I liked them blended or on the rocks tho. My wife ordered a regular margarita and our guest got a soft drink.   For entrees, I ordered the BBQ Chipotle Tacos, my wife got the Roasted Tomatillo Spinach Fish Tacos and our guest ordered the California Burro.   My entree was well prepared, with plenty of chipotle sauce and filling. My wife's tacos were equally impressive. Our guest had a fairly neutral reaction to his rather plain looking burro. I think he was expecting more sauce, since it was pretty dry.   Service was cheerful and adequate for a slow night.   I recommend Macayo's for those who are uninitiated in Mexican food. They actually serve Tex-Mex but it is a good step into the Mexican cuisine for Easterners like our guest.

House of Tricks is located near ASU in a quiet neighborhood on 7th Street in a tastefully redone two story home.   Our reservation for 6 diners at 7 was for the beautiful patio, which we always prefer. They have a fire pit and numerous heaters, so we were comfy on a cool fall evening.   We ordered cocktails, which took some time but they had a full house. Soon after we ordered appetizers and entrees because the apps are so big, three of us had those instead of entrees.   For the table, we had a cheese tray, loaded with six cheeses, fruit and various breads. Two ordered soup. Tonight they served oriental onion and beef broth with crispy rice, cilantro and a heavenly addition of mushrooms. Mine was outstanding. The other who ordered soup tipped the bowl at the end so as not to miss any!    One of us had the pecan smoked salmon (app as an entree), two had the Harissa spiced mussels (app as an entree) while the guys had halibut, rag pasta with veal and ahi tuna.   Nothing but yummy sounds from the girls with the apps as entrees and the halibut entree. I ordered the ahi tuna but also tasted the veal. The tuna was seared perfectly and had a flavorful soy broth to dip into. The veal pasta was excellent as well.   We were visited by the two house cats during dinner. They weren't looking for handouts. Just wanted to say hi!  Service: excellent Menu selection: excellent Food: excellent Prices: okay (about $125 per couple) Atmosphere: excellent  Recommendations: go as many times as you can afford. The menu changes and it was difficult deciding between epic dishes.

Stayed at the Excalibur Hotel for a Fleetwood Mac concert recently. We booked far enough in advance to get a good rate ($60 + $20 room fee) so it was reasonable.   Room was plenty big for two of us with a king bed, table and two chairs, shower and vanity. It had a wall safe, 40" TV and no fridge (the place for the fridge was empty.) TV was fair to bad with mostly bad reception.   Express checkout was easy and quick. Will return.

Anniversary dinner at Durant's.  Arrived at 7 on a Friday night (with reservations) and it was hopping. A very cool feature for Durant's: you enter thru the kitchen. I wanted to linger but perhaps another time when they aren't so busy.   We were seated immediately and brought ice water and a crudités plate. Nice touch. Our server, Michelle, offered to place our drinks while another server brought the bread: a small sourdough loaf smothered in olive oil and sautéed leeks.   We ordered Oysters Rockefeller as our appetizer.  For entrées, my wife and I were thinking similar: Filet Minion and Shrimp for her, Filet and Scallops for me. We each got a salad but while she wanted a baked potato, while I craved the Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes.   After we finished the bread and salads, the oysters arrived, hot and bubbly. Lots of sauce, cheese and bacon-excellent!  Our entrées were not disappointing either. The scallops were perfectly seasoned and cooked and the steaks?  Incredible. Juicy, cooked to perfection, seasoned well and tender as only Filet can be.   The total bill, with tip, was $220. Definitely worth the meal. We took a considerable amount of food home but we couldn't bring the five star service home. Michelle and her staff excelled at staying professional yet comfortable.   I recommend Durant's for a romantic, very tasty meal!

First time at this Pei Wei. Ordered for 13 for business meeting.   I ordered the Thai Dynamite (along with nine others) with chicken. It was decent, with a good balance between the amount of protein and rice. Not very spicy though, which was unfortunate. I think they got overwhelmed by our voluminous order at 11:30 AM.   We all wished they had labeled the tubs with names. We added names to the order but they all came mixed and with no names on them. Of course, a lot of them looked the same. It seriously took about twenty minutes to sort them all out.   Hopefully they will take the time to do it right next time.

First time at Chino Bandito. Arrived at 5:30 on a Thursday evening and only 12 diners. Hmm.   I ordered Pollo Diablo, Jen Red Pork, Black Beans and Jerk Fried Rice. All items were presented in bite-sized portions. They were fresh but lacked a lot of pizazz that I'd been hearing about. The pollo Diablo was supposed to be the hottest item out there. It was medium heat. I think it needed sauce cuz it seemed more like chicken nuggets with some spice to me.   The Jen Red was good but, again, not very saucy. The rice was okay.  Just not much flavor exuding from it. The beans were pretty awful. They were runny and tasted canned.   The cookie on the side was a nice touch.   Not sure if I'll be back. It's not in a great location, the decor is despicable (card tables, plastic chairs, dirty floor and snapshots of kids for art) and an annoying TV. I felt like I was in school, eating a school lunch.   These guys need to get a clue that folks want ambiance with their meal, not crap they thought was cute when they were young.

First time at this TGIF and any TGIF in years. Arrived at 11:45 for lunch on a Tuesday and the place was nearly empty. Ominous.   I wasn't very hungry, or I would normally order the fully-loaded whatever but today I ordered a French Dip Sandwich with fries and an iced tea for $14.60. Obviously service was tight cuz there were about 10 other customers. The Bartender,  Heather, was my server. She did an outstanding job explaining the menu,  keeping my glass full and tending to the needs of her few guests.   My lunch arrived in about five minutes. The bread for the sandwich was pillow-soft. Thinly shaved roast, melted cheese and caramelized onions. Yum!  The au jus was excellent. Lots of caramelized onions plus umami-rich mushrooms. The fries were done just right too. I found myself dipping my fries in the au jus!  I recommend TGIF for a quick, very tasty, if a bit expensive, lunch.

Placed a corporate order to go for lunch for four today.    They don't seem to have an online system of ordering. I had to arrive 30 minutes before lunch, place the order and then sit there waiting for it.   Everyone seemed to enjoy the flavor of their lunches but they were ALL loaded into the to-go bags upside down, so it was pretty messy.   My lunch, French Dip, was missing the dip. That really changed the sandwich, unfortunately. It wasn't too busy today so there should've been no excuses.   Very disappointing to serve my boss such a mess. Doubt if I will use TGIF for corporate lunches again.

First time at YC's today.  I had been to others, years ago, so I was hopeful it would be just as good. It wasn't. The front register is so close to the door that after ONE person walks in, the rest have to line up outside.   On to the food:  Hot and sour soup wasn't hot or sour. Definitely mediocre and needed strong shots of vinegar and hot sauce, which weren't in sight. For the Mongolian BBQ portion, the peanuts were whole, which makes no sense. Not chopped?  Also the sweet and sour sauce was so thin it just missed the mark. The main portions were fine, with good selections of proteins, veggies and sauces.   For ambiance: The TV had still pics of customers and was generally boring. In other words, no ambiance.   I can't recommend YC's at this point but I always give a place two tries, just in case they had an off day.

Arrived at noon on a Monday and there were about 40 guests eating and 6-7 in line. I was thru the line in 2 minutes. These guys know how to run a fast line!  I ordered a barbacoa bowl. It was good, with all ingredients the proper temp but there just wasn't much protein in the dish. Closer to home, I get about 1&1/2 the amount of meat. Probably better for the Scottsdale socialites?

First time at Bobby Q tonight. Read about it on MSN as one of the top 10 steakhouses in America.   We arrived at 7:30 on a Saturday evening at t the place was hopping. We were seated right away tho. Our server, Amber, greeted us quickly. We were brought menus and cornbread as we made our drink orders.   For entrées we ordered the Ribeye with baked potato and side salad and I got the three meat combo. I ordered Brisket, Baby Back Ribs and a Hot Link. My sides were Mac N Cheese and Pecan Cole Slaw. It all came to $80 plus tip with two glasses of wine.  The entrees were good. The ribeye was cooked perfectly, had minimal gristle and was flavorful. The ribs were very tender. The brisket was good but personally I don't like BBQ sauce on my brisket but that's the way it came. The hot link had no snap but was tasty.   The Mac n cheese was excellent but the slaw was very boring. Why five stars?  Good food, excellent service and decent value.

I've been to Penzey's a dozen times but never thought to review.   Penzey's offers spices that are not normally available in your local grocery store, along with all the basics that are easy to find. The difference is that you can buy bulk at Penzey's and save a considerable amount of money.   Examples: I cook with a lot of garlic powder, so I buy the 17 ounce bags to refill my 3 ounce jar. It is also available in 1 ounce jars, if you want to try something new. The last time I shopped for garlic powder, I found roasted garlic powder, which has a rich, earthy flavor. They also offer minced garlic and garlic salt.   Everything in the store is well laid out alphabetically so you can zip thru your list with little trouble. I usually stop in for 3-4 items and zip out with 7-8.

First time at this Valle Luna but have been to the Chandler location several times.   We arrived at 11:45 for lunch on a Wednesday and waited about five mins to be seated. The decor looked updated but they went for a dark look with table lights. A bit gloomy.   Our server, Claire, was efficient in bringing us menus and drinks. My coworker ordered the Sizzling Steak and Shrimp Fajitas and a coke while I ordered the Burro de la Casa with an iced tea. My meal came out in about 10 minutes along with his condiments but his sizzling platter took about five more mins, so I finished way early.   The fajitas were tender and flavorful but the amount of onions was overwhelming and he ended up picking thru them to look for protein. My burro was nicely made (I got Machaca) and the sauce was nicely spiced. The meat was tender, juicy and fulfilling.   The only downside was at the end of our meal - she disappeared and we waited quite a while for our check.

First time at Takamatsu. Came here on a recommendation. Arrived at 6 on a Tuesday for dinner. There were five other tables full.   The menu is a mix of Japanese and Korean. The Japanese was the sushi while the Korean was the BBQ and entrées. I had sushi for lunch, so...  Between the three of us we ordered Pork Bulgolgi, Beef Kalbi, Bipimbap and two teas. The total came to $63 plus tip, which was a good deal.   There was plenty of food. The Bipimbap was okay. The meat was a bit sparse but it was tender and moist. The egg was over cooked too. The Bulgolgi and Kalbi were excellent. They each had tons of flavorful, juicy meat served on a sizzling platter and lots of sides like pickled kimchi, boiled and sauced potatoes, pickled sprouts, fish cakes, etc.   The Kalbi in particular was so tender you'd never know they were mostly collagen.   I recommend Takamatsu for a fast, inexpensive flavorful and authentic Korean dinner. Try the BBQ menu!

First time at Gallaghers. Arrived for Monday Night Football and it was 1/2 full. We ordered nachos, which were okay but the salsa was disappointing. More jarred taste than made-in-the-kitchen taste.   I ordered Bill's Blue Cheese Burger and a beer.  The burgers here are big, so I had trouble finishing but it was a good meal. The side of Bleu Cheese was very runny though.   All told, we ordered one burger, one wrap, two baked potatoes and 8 drinks plus nachos for $76 plus tip. Pretty High for bar food. The entrées  were ample but the sides were sparse.   Service was great. Lindsay was efficient, followed through with special requests and checked in on us appropriately.   I wasn't overwhelmed but I'll probably try Gallagher's again.

First review for this Port of Subs. Been coming to PoS for almost 30 years tho.   Ordered the hot pastrami combo online. I don't like the bread grilled though but they always accommodate.   I arrived 10 minutes before my appointed time but it was just coming out anyway (they were just opening).  Sandwich was hot, with juicy meat and crisp toppings. The most important part, to me, is the bread though. Bad bread can spoil a good lunch. My sourdough was soft and warm, delicious.   Service was good (for takeout) and I will be returning.

First time at this Applebee's and most likely, my last. I arrived at 11:45 on a Thursday for lunch and there were about 8 other guests.   I was greeted/seated right away and Jenn took care of me with all the proper etiquette. The food was the disappointment.   I ordered the Lunch Combo Signature Special: Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad plus French Onion Soup. It arrived in about five minutes. Hmm, a little too fast?  The soup was decent: it had all the right components such as good broth, onions, big crouton and cheese. Thankfully it wasn't too salty like many places. The salad was awful. It arrived with a stale, tasteless breadstick and the dressing was so scant I actually thought the cook forgot it and had to look under the first layer of lettuce. The chicken was boring and all around, would never recommend the salad.

Tried HH again to see if they could improve upon last visit. It got worse. The pizza is always fine: great crusts, good selection of toppings, good prices. The service at this location is horrendous.   I ordered two pizzas online, 15 minutes after they opened and it said it would be ready in 20 minutes. I knew better, so I showed up after 30 minutes and they still weren't ready. After waiting another 10 minutes, she tells me that they made the wrong pizza. I had ordered a two-topping pizza plus the special two-topping pizza, which gives $1 to the Children's Hospital. They made a regular pepperoni instead of the special.   She said I could either wait another 20 minutes for a new one (and let my other pizza get cold) or take the one topping pizza for the two topping price. Plus the hospital doesn't get the donation.  Unbelievable.   Avoid this location. I have been here twice. Two different crews, same results both times- rip off.

First time at Shane's. Arrived at 11:40 on a Thursday and there were a dozen guests plus six in line.   I ordered the Brisket Plate with Mac N Cheese plus Fried Okra and a tea for $17.20. Steep for lunch but not for BBQ.   They have four BBQ sauces plus Carolina vinegar available at the condiment table - nice touch. My meal arrived in 10 minutes but I noticed that the folks behind me in line were served first.   The okra was the the highlight of the meal, unfortunately. It was lightly battered, crisp and hot with an aioli on the side. The Mac was okay. It was cheesy but dry instead of creamy. Perhaps yesterday's batch?    The brisket was the lowlight of the meal. Although there was a lot of beef, it was extremely dry. I'm a brisket snob and judge it by being able to shred it with only a fork. I had to SAW with my knife to get thru it since it was so dry. I only ate half.   The service was non existent. My server, after serving everyone else, literally tossed my plate on my table, which nearly slid off the table. I also never saw her again, so I don't know her name.   Very doubtful I will revisit Shane's again but I like to think the pit master had a bad day. I work 200 yards away so perhaps if I see that the owner reads his reviews and responds, I would return for a redo and improve my rating.

Paint department is always helpful. My company buys a lot of paint and hardware tools from Lowe's and paint really stands out. They always work hard to help me find what I need.   Hardware is often out of common nuts and bolts or tools. A bit frustrating and I usually go online to Harbor Freight.

Philly's Famous always comes thru with solid cheesesteaks. They have quite a selection on the menu and even tho I've been here 20 times, I've never ordered anything else.   The meat is tender, the bread is soft, the cheese, sauce and onions are all good. The decor is obviously geared towards Philadelphia sports teams, along with the geographical pics denoting several landmarks, making it all look pub-ish.   I like the family atmosphere that Rita and her family bring. She always greets me with 'Sweetie' and loves what she does.   The only knock on PF is the speed. Joey tends to cook 1-2 sandwiches at a time. If you show up with no line: great. It takes about 7-9 minutes. If there is a line: yikes. I have waited a 1/2 hour in the past. Yes, I waited. They're good sandwiches.   Try PF. My fave is the 8" cheesesteak with onions and red sauce. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

Went to the Irish Cultural Center for the first time. Saw Tartanic, a crazy bagpipes and drums group that we love.   The cultural center was informative, had ample parking and was really cool. I recommend it for those who want a peek at their Irish heritage.

First time at this Red Robin. Arrived at 11:35 on a Friday for lunch. The place was hopping. Really good sign.   I was seated within 3 minutes but was led to the bar area. Nervous since you often get poor service there. The bartender took my order 5 mins later: Burning Love Burger and a coke.   My drink arrived quickly of course but lunch didn't arrive until 17 minutes later.  I cut my burger in half like always but that was a mistake: they had broken the patty into three pieces, so now I had numerous pieces. Every time I tried to take a bite, it fell apart. I ended up eating my burger with a knife and fork which wasn't as appetizing.   My service really fell apart too. Since he was the bartender, the only other time I saw him was when he gave me the bill.   For a burger, which was in three pieces, fries and a coke, with no service, to cost me $12 plus tip, I'll go elsewhere.

First time at T Bone tonight. Too many accidents on the road, so the missus and I stopped by on a Tuesday night at 6:00. One other couple here - ominous. Maybe they can't get past the traffic?  We were greeted immediately and had our choice of tables. Took a window table and Lean provided menus and silver. Had to send the silver back but got our wine/iced tea ordered.   My wife ordered the 8oz filet, which came with salad bar, cowboy beans and bread. She also ordered mashed potatoes. I ordered the 1/4 chicken and 6oz steak, which also came with salad bar, beans and bread.   We cozied up to the salad bar. All the veggies were cold and crisp but not many options. Lettuce, toms, cukes, croutons, onion/green bean mixture and dressings. Nothing special but at least it tasted fresh.   My wife loved her steak and mashed pots. They were prepared well and she ate every bite. My steak and chicken were both a bit over cooked but the chicken was seasoned so well that it survived the flame. The steak was tough, for med-rare. The cowboy beans are not our fave, so I only tasted them. The bread was sandwich bread served with butter. Disappointing.   We will try T-Bone again on a weekend when there are more folks out. It was a VERY windy night and I think most folks stayed home. We like excitement when we dine out and like the interaction with other guests.  Part two: arrived on a Saturday night in late January and it was packed. We ordered about the same meals, plus alcoholic drinks for $57 before tip. We had leftovers. I still recommend T-Bone. Based on the size of some of the other guests, I'm not alone!

Another trip to T-Bone, this time with nine of us. We made reservations for seven o'clock on a Friday night and arrived right on time. There were about 1/2 tables empty.   Our extra large table was reserved so we were seated right away and, once again, Leon took care of us for the evening.   He did a really good job keeping up with our boisterous group, keeping all the orders straight and never dropping the ball. Everything came out just right.   I ordered one of the specials that night: dry aged New York Strip Steak. All entrées come with salad bar, cowboy beans and bread. Nothing has changed about the bland salad bar, unfortunately. Still a boring side. The beans and bread, tho good, are never great.   My steak was cooked just like I like it: medium rare. It had good flavor and I really enjoyed it. There was only one who didn't indulge into their full meal but she's like that.   Good food, excellent service and outstanding view. Is there anything else you want in a good dinner?

First time at Famous Ray's Pizza but I didn't order a pizza. For a Friday lunch, the two of us got a Philly Cheesesteak and six wings each.   Our lunch was done in about 8 mins. The sandwich was okay but with Jersey Mikes next door it didn't compare. The wings were good though. Just enough crunch, saucy and cooked perfectly. I like the wings at Streets of New York, around the corner, so I doubt if I'll be coming back. Maybe the pizza is better?

First time at this Picazzo's. We've been to the one in Sedona and had a good meal. This was even better.   We arrived around 2:00PM on a Monday and there were about seven other parties of tables, so we were seated right away and were given our choice of patio, bar or restaurant.   Our server, Cynthia, was busy with another order so another server gave us lemon water and asked us to wait. Nice touch.   We ordered the lunch specials and both got pizza and salad.  My wife ordered the gluten free/dairy free pizza slice with pepperoni and mushrooms with a garden salad plus Chardonnay. I got the pepperoni slice with a wedge salad and lemonade.   Lunch arrived in 12 minutes, pizza and salad on the same plate. It was fine because the plate was big enough.   Both pizzas were a good size, hot with good crust, sauce and toppings. The salads were cold, fresh and crisp.   Overall, $31.90 for a very filling, sumptuous meal. I highly recommend Piccazo's.

First time at Carl's in over 25 years. Ordered the Jalapeño Burger meal 1/3 pound for $9.95. While I waited I noticed music videos playing. Annoying to me but probably popular with most.   My lunch arrived in 4 minutes. The fries were  hot and crisp, the bun was fresh and the veggies (lettuce, tomatoes, onion, jalapeños) were all crisp and cool. I don't know what sauce they put on it but it complimented the sandwich perfectly.   I recommend this Carl's for quality food, fast, friendly service and good value.

Great hidden gem for breakfast.  My wife and I brought an out-of-town guest today. Arrived at 10 on a Friday morning and it was half full. Impressive.   We were greeted quickly and given menus, which differ on weekdays from weekends: It's more limited. There were still plenty of choices tho.   Our guest ordered the Farm Monte Cristo and coffee. My wife tried the Huevos Rancheros with coffee while I ordered the "Pork is the New Black" Omlette plus tea.   Our brunches arrived in less than 10 minutes. Our guest commented on her Monte Cristo: "Oh, it's not battered and fried".  She liked the Farm version much better than the traditional one!  My wife enjoyed her Huevos as well. My plate was really well thought out: plenty of meats, cooked perfectly with a bit of char, eggs just right, cheesy, melted goodness on top and smothered in gravy.   I highly recommend The Farm and the Morning Glory Cafe.

Nice store, always clean and orderly. Salesmen always greet but keep things very casual and conversational.   I don't think I've ever experienced a sales approach like theirs before: they want to know what you want, based on your lifestyle, outdoor living area, future needs and entertainment setup, rather than just selling you a piece of patio furniture.   Very classy.

I ordered a four piece set from Paddy O Furniture and had to Yelp it.   My order arrived on the day it was promised. The drivers called 15 mins before the delivery to say they were coming, which was a nice touch.   Upon arrival I showed John and Brad where I wanted my set. They carried it to my desired location, unbagged the cushions, clamped all the modular pieces together and really knew what they were doing.   Even tho it was 110 outside, they remained professional and polite. John added reflective glass to my existing fire pit, they removed the plastic bags and offered furniture covers (which I bought), while using an iPad for the transaction, which was impressive.   It was a very good experience and I highly recommend Paddy O Furniture for high end - great warranty outdoor furniture. I even added another piece a week later!

First time at Pappadeaux. Arrived 10 mins early with reservations and waited 20 anyway. Hmm. Our server, Reno, arrive about 7 mins after that. He dropped off water and turned to leave but we had waited long enough to know we wanted the Oyster Duo for an app. He tried to leave again before we could order drinks. Not a good start.   Besides the app and two drinks, we got Filet Minion with Lobster Tail and the Atlantic Salmon Alexander. The bill came to $119.20 plus tip.   The oysters were good. Our favorites were the cheesy ones but the spinach-hollandaise oysters were good too - just too much spinach. Most of the food on the entrées was excellent. The fillet was seasoned perfectly, tender and juicy-just what my wife wanted. The lobster tail was huge, accompanied by a vat of butter and some big, tender asparagus. My salmon was cooked just right, with a crispy crust but was still moist and with great Cajun seasoning. The crawfish, scallops and shrimp were all good but the shrimp were small. The decadent sauce over all was rich and creamy. I didn't care for the dirty rice but I think it was due to flavors, not the way it was cooked. Just not my kind of rice dish.   Reno was okay as a server. He was new and didn't have a routine down yet but he was warm and engaging and he will be good if his managers will give him a chance to bloom.   We may go back to Pappadeaux again. The parking lot was cutthroat and the wait time for some was brutal. Perhaps we'll return in the summer when the snowbirds have left!

First time at San Tan Brewery in Chandler. Great brew pub tucked in the west side of old town Chandler square.   We arrived at 4 PM on a Saturday and the place was hopping. We got our table for seven pretty quickly but the place filled all the way up before we left. Several burgers, a pizza, sliders, tacos and a quesadilla were ordered, along with beers and wine. I didn't keep track of everything so I'll relate our experience with my wife's and my meals.   My wife ordered a Gluten Free Naked Burger, with salad and wine. Boring to me but she ate every bite. I got the Stuffed Bleu Bayou Burger and a Moon Juice IPA. Both were cooked spot-on as requested. I stole the onions off her burger (see pic) but gave her some fries (see pic again). The fries weren't gluten free but she's only slightly allergic to it.   My burger was very good. Bleu Cheese in the burger and on top. Sometimes that can be too much but it was just right. The bacon was super crisp - yay. The veggies cold and crisp and the bun nicely toasted.   The fries were awesome, as previous Yelpers claimed they'd be!  Highly recommend San Tan Brewery!

First time at this GB and first time for any GB since Yelping. Arrived at 1 on a Friday for lunch. The patio was pretty full and the tables inside were 1/4 full.   Jason greeted me quickly and I ordered a raspberry iced tea and a Marzen BBQ burger. It came with sauce, bacon and cheddar, plus garlic fries on the side. It came to $16.25 plus tip, which is high for a burger.   My lunch arrived in 7-8 minutes. The fries were killer. Lots of garlic, some parsley and salt. Just perfect. The burger was very good, if a bit messy but burgers with BBQ sauce always are. It was also huge. The veggies were crisp, bun nicely toasted and cooked just like I asked-medium rare. After a few, Jason refilled my tea and offered me one to go as well - nice.   I recommend GB for a tasty, if expensive, lunch.

First time at Wingstop in months. Been Jonesin for good wings but wife doesn't like BBQ very much (I know, right?). She's busy, so Wingstop!  Ordered the 6 PC combo with hot flavor, bleu cheese dip, fries and a drink for $8.50. They arrived in 14 mins, just as promised, hot out if the fryer.   Wingstop wings are always hot, juicy and crispy-just the way I like them. The fries are awesome if you eat them right away. Don't take fries to go unless you eat them on the way home. They get soggy.   Okay, I wrote all the above before getting my wings, since Wingstop never disappoints. They disappointed me today.   The wings were very small with not much meat on them and the fries were soggy right away. I think the cook was getting rid of poor stock on a to-go customer and didn't really care. Too bad.   I usually recommend Wingstop. Love them over any other wing place, including ATL, Native and any other. Try them but check your to-go order in the store.

Had a cut on my thumb (actually I cut the end of my thumb off) so I came here. There was one other person in line. Brandy was very professional at the reception desk.   After filling the necessary paperwork and paying the copay, I was seen within five minutes. Rox took my vitals, did the pre-screen and generally put me at ease.   About five minutes later, the NP, Rebecca, came in and looked at my home bandage job. It had stuck to my wound so she did a good job of getting it removed without undue pain, took a look, explained what I had done right/wrong, cleaned it up, gave me advice, prescriptions, new dressing, extra dressings and sent me on my way.   I would recommend this location anytime to anyone wanting efficient, clean and friendly help.

Business lunch today for a few of our guys. The five of us arrived at 11:40 AM with big appetites (two of the guys are BIG) so I hope they fill up.   There was no wait today, so we were seated right away. I ordered the Fried Cheese and Bacon Burger with fries and a Raspberry Iced Tea. The others ordered a T-bone steak, tilapia, ribeye and shrimp scampi.   The service deserves a shout out: Alyssa was patient with our boisterous group and did a great job of catering to our needy guys. She had a good sense of humor and deserved the large tip I left.   All the meals were cooked to everyone's satisfaction. The only issue that was brought up: the baked potatoes were huge but the mashed potatoes were scant. The mashed guy felt a bit slighted. Other than that, all kudos.   I will be returning with a crowd, since this is a favorite of our team. Good job Logan's!

Another business lunch but to go this time. I sure wish they had online ordering. I didn't want to risk mistakes ordering six lunches over the phone, so I came in, ordered and then waited 25 minutes.   In all, we ordered three Steak and Rib Combos, one Roadhouse Salad with Grilled Chicken and two Kicking Chicken Salads. Each came with a side and the combos came with side salads.   The host was patient with me as I ordered but it was rather slow anyway.   As far as accuracy, the order was spot on. Thank you for that!  For food quality, since I'd been to TRB several times, I knew what to expect. They excel at BBQ, are pretty good with burgers and sides but so-so with the odd stuff that is non BBQ, like signature salads.   Please get an online ordering system!  I told my guys at work that they can't order from here anymore, since it's such a pain.

Sauce, Part II. Arrived at 11:40 on a Friday and there were 25 guests eating and 15 in line. Got to the counter in 5 mins. Ordered a salad this time since that's what most order here.   I ordered the Caesar Chicken Salad and a soft drink for $10.83. Yikes. That's a lot for veggies and chicken. My order arrived in 11 minutes. It was fresh, crisp and cold. The chicken was shredded but the whole dish was assembled in a way that didn't make you think 'pre-packaged' portions.   The dressing had a good garlic note, the croutons were seasoned well but were tooth-shatteringly hard. The meal also arrived with a French roll.   Speedier service and less toast on the croutons and we would've had a real winner.

First time at this Culver's. Been to the Chandler location numerous times with good results.   Arrived at 11:40 AM on a Wednesday and it was 1/3 full. The counter service was minimal, as my cashier was disengaged from his main focus: service. Had it been my first time, I would've been lost with the extensive menu and toppings choices. Good thing I knew what I was doing.   I ordered a Cheddar Butterburger with Bacon, a side of Cheese Curds and a soft drink. The burger was hot, with melted cheese, crisp veggies and a toasted bun. The curds, battered and then deep fried, never disappoint.   I recommend Culver's for a quick, inexpensive bite. For service: it needs some polishing up.

Repeat of fIrst Culver's visit. Same place, ordered same food. Service was exceptional this time. She was engaging, polite and cheerful: a great way to start lunch.  I arrived at 11:50 on a Tuesday and the place was hopping. I had to look a while to find a small table. My lunch arrived 8 minutes later.   The burger was hot, with a good sear with melted cheddar. The bun was fresh and soft and the curds: uh oh. She missed the fact that I asked for curds and put fries on the order. The fries had an off-taste and I didn't eat them. I miss my curds.   I recommend this location for a fast, affordable lunch.

Another sojourn to Culvers. Always good burgers. Great service this time. My order (same as before) arrived piping hot with crisp veggies, crunchy curds and a smile from the server. That's all you could ask for!

Chipotle night tonight. Been here many times and they rarely disappoint anymore. Management reads our reviews and reacts appropriately.   I ordered a burrito and a bowl tonight. Got our usual barbacoa delishishness and we weren't let down.   Try a mix of salsas, such as hot/corn. Very tasty that way.

Hadn't been to Culver's in a couple of years, since I changed jobs and don't get out this way anymore. Nice to see they haven't changed. Frequented by seniors because it's a Midwest fave and for the good prices.   Ordered the bacon cheddar butter burger (single) with curds and a drink for under $8. Lunch arrived in 6 minutes flat-nice. Burger was hot, juicy and choice of standard toppings: mayo, mustard, onions, lettuce, tomato, etc.   Bacon was crisp too, just perfect. Cheese was thick cut with a slight melt. The cheese curds are not what you'd expect on your first visit. They bread them and fry them to perfection. Nice little cheesy nuggets of flavor.   The service at Culver's is always tops. Greeted properly at the door but not with the robotic 'welcome' you get at fast food. As the food is delivered to your table, the server always asks if there is anything else they can get for you. I was offered a custard sample at my table as well.   Culver's is a go-to for quality, service and price.

Tried PB again. It's been several months but, sadly, it got worse.   The intake station was, once again, unstaffed, so I moved along the line. Soon, a guy came from the back and called me back to the back of the line. I ordered  the pick 2 lunch, with 1/2 sandwich and a small soup. The intake guy charged me for two sandwiches and two soups. The cashier said there was nothing he could do and then charged me for the four items.   As my sandwich was brought to my table, the server said she would notify the manager of the error. The manager eventually evened out the bill but in the process, riled me about my choice of football team (on my credit card) to the point of being belligerent. He was inappropriate and the final straw in my decision never to visit Paradise Bakery again.

First time at Tum Nak Thai today. Even tho we arrived at 3 PM, it was half full inside (a good sign).  Ordered Beef Larb, Shrimp Pad Thai and Pork Spicy Green Beans.   The service was fast to start and our Larb arrived in 7 mins. It was tasty, with just the right amount of spice. Most of it was on top of the lettuce tho, so we couldn't eat it as a wrap, just with forks. Still good tho.   3 mins later our entrees arrived, piping hot. The Pad Thai had a sweet taste but very good. The Green Beans were spicier than we expected. We realized that they were called Spicy Green Beans but we ordered all our dishes medium hot and this one was blazing.   Service was a bit off after that, probably due to the crowd. Just mom serving 6 tables and she had trouble keeping up. Never got offered any drinks beyond water and even that got ignored despite an empty glass.   I recommend Tum Nak Thai but hopefully they will add a server.

Bummer visit. Went on a Saturday night but it was late enough to avoid the really big crowds. Got a table in 10 mins.  Asked for a gluten free menu, which Red Robin is really good at. My wife ordered a GF burger, no onions, no cheese and a side salad instead of fries. I ordered the prime rib dip with fries and cole slaw.  We also asked for silverware and napkins since they were missing.   Our order arrived in about 10 mins, still no napkins or silverware. Got those after five more mins. My wife's burger had onions (no cheese) but the biggie: her salad had croutons!  Really?  The server had even asked if she preferred a GF bun or if she was gluten allergic. I SAW him write down allergic!  My sandwich was tasty but they were obviously getting rid of stale bread. I know the difference between toasted and stale too. Good thing I had the au jus.   Lastly, my endless fries and bottomless lemonade?  Never saw the waiter again until he brought us the bill.   I'm done with that Red Robin. Obviously they don't care.

First time using Paradise Carpet Cleaning but definitely not my last. Contacted them to set an appointment before our big party. We were able to schedule right when we needed.   Note: they aren't available on weekends but don't let that deter you. They're really good.   George called me the morning of the appointment that he was 30-40 out. Guess what: he arrived in 35 minutes. We have an oversized room that had traffic spots, two reclining sofas, a rocker recliner and a reclining chaise, all in microfiber. Total cost: $243 plus tip.   The service was courteous, friendly and efficient, everything you want from service. I highly recommend Paradise Carpet Cleaning for your carpets, furniture and value.

Been here many times. Thought I'd write.   The location isn't really near any other Starbucks, so it's usually really full. Unfortunately they are usually slow as well. Today, we arrived at 12:30 PM on a Saturday and there were 6-7 cars in line, usually about a 30 minute wait, so we headed inside.   There were 8 eating and drinking and only one in line.  The person in front of us ordered three drinks, so I groaned to myself.   To my surprise, our two drinks were called within four minutes. Thank you for fixing that Starbucks!

First time ordering P.F. Chang's to-go for a group. Had a luncheon and placed orders for seven lunches.   The website was very clear and concise. The meals were ready right at the appointed time. Both important aspects when ordering business lunches.   The server walked me thru the entire order and showed me each dish. Excellent experience and I will be returning.

First time at this WingStop. Been getting their wings for years at other locations and just discovered this one near work.   Ordered online and order was right on time. Ordered the eight piece combo with fries and a drink for just under $10. Got original hot and Louisiana Rub.   The fries were good but, as with all fast food joints, they give you the fryer leftovers so my basket had some loser fries. Too bad.   The wings were very good. The Original Hot were a bit slight of sauce but not too much. The Rub wings were perfect: crispy, juicy and a good amount of rub on them.   The counter service was excellent and efficient with a soft up sell on the drink, since I paid at the store.   Overall, always good wings but fries are a crapshoot when you take them to go.

First time at The Keg. Five of us arrived at 7:30 but we had reservations so we were seated right away. It was about 3/4 full on a Saturday.   We all ordered steaks plus we got a glass of wine, a bottle of wine, three desserts and a coffee. I was okay with all of that but $7 for coffee?  I thought Starbucks was pricey.   The steaks were all cooked as requested, which is often hard to get. The side veggies were extremely scant but the 'accompaniments' were large. It was a satisfying meal and, including tip it came to $50 per person.   Recommendations: Bleu Cheese Filet (lots of cheese); Sirloin Oscar, (topped with shrimps and scallops); creme brûlée (huge).

Tried In and Out after a year hiatus. Don't know why, just none near me or near work. Arrived at 12:45PM on a Thursday and there were 35 inside plus 25 cars lined up around the corner.   Ordered a Double-double Animal style and small drink for $5.19. The menu is small but they are good at what they do.   My sandwich arrived in seven minutes, fresh and hot. To you noobs out there: don't take it out of the wrapper. It's too juicy, stuffed and fresh to hold up without it.   My burger was animal style, which means grilled onions. The bun was toasted with lots of crisp, cold lettuce, sliced tomato, pickles and relish plus thousand island dressing. Very messy.   Never a complaint here. The fries are good too, I just wasn't hungry enough for them.

First time at this Applebee's. Had trepidation about the service, based on previous reviews. Service was just fine, with quick seating, friendly greeting and just the right amount of attention.   My wife ordered the Seasonal Berry and Spinach Salad and wine while I had the 4 Cheese Mac & Cheese with Honey Pepper Chicken Tenders and a Strawberry Lemonade.   The salad was fresh and light but they forgot the pecans. My wife always likes crunch with her salads, so that was a key missing piece for her.   My entree was tasty but needed help. The cheese sauce was so thin that it didn't cling to the pasta. Also the chicken was SO sweet that the flavor of the chicken (and pasta) got lost. The breadstick was a nice touch, as it was very similar to the mouth watering Olive Garden bread. Not a bad meal, just needed some tweaking to the recipe.   We will try Applebee's again, but not the Mac 'N Chicken.

First time at this Port of Subs but have been a regular for over 30 years.   I arrived at 11:40 AM on a Tuesday and there were 10 people eating and another seven in line, which moved quickly. I ordered a medium hot pastrami and a bag of chips for about $9.   My sandwich was piled high with pastrami,  cheese and fresh veggies. There was a choice of about five cheeses, 12 veggies, four spreads and good shaker options (oil and vinegar, etc.)  The bread is always baked fresh in-store and mine was soft with a perfect crust.   I highly recommend Port of Subs. If you like hot sammies, try the hot pastrami. For cold lovers, the number one is a fave.

First time at Tuck Shop, based on daughter's recommendation. She's a chef and knows food.   We arrived at 7 PM on a Friday night, without reservations and we were seated right away. There were three more empty tables.   Between the four of us, we ordered two apps (Mac N Cheese and Potato Skins), a glass of wine, an iced tea and four entrees (the special Yellowtail with Celery Root Puree, the Steak with Lentil Mashed Potatoes and two specials which were Meatloaf and Scalloped, Chipotle/Chorizo Potatoes).  It came to $138 or about $35 per person. That's about right for good comfort food.   Our server was outstanding. She explained the menu, specials and offered advice. She kept our glasses full and was pleasant.   Food: Yellowtail was good but way too much Puree. There was thrice the Puree to fish. The steak was good. Good smoke, cooked just right. Again, huge portion of potatoes. The meatloaf dishes were good but the chipotle sauce was used liberally and overwhelmed the dish.   Good food at the Tuck Shop, they just need to temper the accompanying items.

First time at this Chipotle but many visits to other franchises. I arrived at 11:30 and there were six full small tables and 20 in line. Not a good mix. The line move very slowly (17 minutes in line). While waiting in line, I saw one server drop her glove on the floor. She put it on anyway, so I asked her to change it.  By the time I was thru the line, it was 45 peeps deep.   I ordered the Barbacoa Burrito and a soft drink for $9.75. The food was up to the Chipotle standard that I have come to expect. The service was pretty bad tho. Oddly, all the guys were very pleasant and the girls weren't. Backwards from common society.   Not sure what's happening at this Chipotle but they need to get it fixed fast or they will suffer a lot of lost business, mine included.

First time at this Olive Garden and first time at any for the past few years.   Five of us got lunch at 12:30 PM and we were greeted and seated right away. We all ordered the soup, salad and breadsticks lunch, plus drinks.   Our lunch arrived in 11 minutes which was impressive for the amount of customers in the place. I got the Chicken & Gnocchi soup with my salad, while everyone else ordered the Zuppa Toscana soup. I tried some of the Zuppa for a second bowl and, while good, the gnocchi was better. It was creamy, with big chunks of chicken and plenty of pillowy, tender gnocchi.   The only downside to the entire meal was the salad. They were so busy for lunch that they were mass producing them and ours had very little dressing, which is a big draw for their salads. Too bad.   The service was outstanding, though.

Needed movers for across-the-valley move for a four bedroom, full patio move.   Derek returned my query promptly and arranged for an estimator to arrive same day.  Sammy and Jose came within an hour and inventoried our possessions. They estimated it would take 8-10 hours but might not fit on one truck, so they arranged for a truck on standby.   Our movers: Robert, Donovan, Erick and Miles were on time and ready to rock. Robert concurred that it prob wouldn't fit on one truck but said there was no standby. Hmm.   They filled the truck with our carefully wrapped items within 3 hours but without another truck, would have to make a return trip. We agreed that I wouldn't be charged for the return driving time but the movers were getting that whiny 'I don't want to return' look so I bought them all lunch.   After unloading, Robert asked me three times if I wanted them to handle the second load. Yes, yes and yes. Again, a bit whiny but it was 104 degrees, so allowances were made for that.   After loading all the patio furnishings, the truck was 3/4 full so they loaded items I couldn't handle alone with my pickup. They unloaded everything with only 1 casualty: the chimnea. They packed it up well but it shattered anyway. Not really their fault.   The total for 10 hours, four movers, one trip charge, two stretch wrap rolls and one bed-box was $2137. Pricey but the time and quality they put into wrapping ALL our items was worth it.   They forgot to apply my Yelp 10% trip charge discount but I forgot too.   I recommend Get Your Move On.  Quick update: within 30 mins of my review, the owner called to cover each point of my review. Nice touch.

I've been shopping at various Safeway stores for decades. The Safeway in Laveen is a poor representation of the quality they profess.   I arrived around 5:45 PM on a Thursday. Usually don't have an issue with products themselves but the dairy free sour cream we get (due to allergies) was all expired. Every one.   Upon reaching checkout around 6:45, there were two express lines open, the self serve lines, and ONE full service line with three full carts in front of me. Since I had a bottle of wine, I knew better than to go through self serve line, so I got in the long line.   The checker, Anthony, was clueless, as was the bagger, Aaron. Anthony waited about 15 minutes (yes, I was still in line) to call for help, which never arrived. Aaron just wandered around aimlessly and then finally helped the express line!  Really?  Then they both proceeded to argue 'thru' me about who he should be helping. Anthony apologized to me but then proceeded to argue for quite a while.   BTW, where was the leadership?  Never saw anyone else. Next time I'll go to Fry's.

First time at Fogo de Chao. Heard from our kids that it was good.  I researched what Yelpers were saying about it and you were all right!  Our reservations were ready on time on a busy Saturday night. The place was packed. We each ordered a drink ($11 each) and settled into our table. Our waiter did a good job explaining how it all works.   We found the salad bar to be full of delights: fresh greens and various chopped salads, meats and cheeses, toppings galore and a few nice surprises, like Hearts of Palm.   We didn't overfill since we knew of the meat bonanza to come. I can pack away a hefty meal but my wife is petite and I knew I would 'lose money' on her with this place.   During the entree portion, we sampled the top sirloin, bottom sirloin, pork sausage and chicken. The other varieties came around after we were full.  We both enjoyed the top sirloin the best and the chicken the least (overcooked). The fried bananas were excellent but the garlic potatoes lacked imagination.   The service was great, if a bit slow at the end. The food was good but a bit overcooked for a guy like me who likes medium-rare red meat.

Another visit but better results. Different server this time and he gave a good amount of attention, the lunch order was perfect, he explained the optional bread and I left with a full belly.   Slow on the out-going process but by that time it was 12:15 and he was getting busy. Good lunch overall.

First time at Li's Bowl. Been driving by it for years but a friend recommended it so, why not?  I arrived at 5 PM on a Monday and there were two other parties, so the ordering went swiftly.   The decor was bright and clean plus the furniture was in good shape. Given the neighborhood, that's a plus.   I ordered a small rainbow roll and 4 cheese wontons, based on Yelp reviews. I added a large can of Arizona and it came to $10.65. Cheap!  Nervous!  It arrived in about 4 mins and looked prepackaged. It had plastic grass to make it look, idk, better?  They offered super cheap plastic forks, packet condiments and thin napkins. They were pretty small rolls as well. I was okay with the flavors but couldn't get past the non-traditional stuff. Oh, but they had an aquarium to make it look traditional.  Lame.    The portions weren't overwhelming so I got a plate of General's Chicken to go. It was nice and hefty but, upon returning home I saw that it was 3/4 rice. Also the GC was very sweet and soggy.   Compared to Panda Express, Li's was better in menu selection and prices. Panda wins for Chinese-American faves, popularity and quality.   Results: Panda, sadly.

Okay, I needed some quality steaks for Christmas dinner so I scoped out the Meat Shop, based on my friend Wendy's recommendation. I was not disappointed. The shop is extremely small with a pervasive smell of bleach. Not a bad smell for meat shop since they were cleaning the cutting stations.   I didn't arrive until 2PM so they had sold out of many cuts. I still got what I came for: T-Bone steaks. They had seven left and that's what I needed!  I told myself before arriving not to overfill the freezer. Should have listened to my own advice cuz I also got a pound of ground beef, two packs of brats and then they tossed in a pound of porchetta brats.   Nice touch. I will update my review after TASTING the offerings.

First time at Ono today. Stopped by on a Sunday at 2:30 PM and there were six tables full. Unfortunately five of them were waiting for their order.   I ordered the #44: BBQ and Katsu combo. Order arrived in 18 minutes. The plate came with steamed cabbage, rice and Mac salad.   First the sides: the Mac is a Hawaiian tradition but never my fave. The rice was hot, sweet and sticky, just the way I like it. The steamed cabbage was, well, steamed cabbage. Just a filler but I like cabbage.   The BBQ: the chicken was okay but the beef was excellent. Juicy, sweet, tender, yummy. The chicken Katsu was crisp, light and tender, another yum. Good meal, they need to add a cook, tho.

First time at Joey's today. About 20 'construction' guys in here scattered about. At least that's what they look like. The decor is a bit gloomy but the Chicago skyline mural helps. The opposite wall has Chicago memorabilia on it, which is a good touch.   I ordered the Polish 'Fire Dog', which is a hot polish dog, with cole slaw and drink for $8. Service was pleasant and helpful.   My lunch arrived in 5 mins. The slaw was cool and crisp with a good balance of mayo, salt and spices. The dog, wrapped in a soft poppy seed bun, was piping hot with mustard, Caramelized onions and sport peppers. The dog had great snap and was perfectly cooked. The onions were sweet, crisp and done just right.   It's tough to go crazy over a hot dog joint but these guys got it right.

Joey's part two. Arrived at 12:40 on a Wednesday for lunch. It was about 1/4 full but I knew what I wanted: a fire dog (spicy polish dog with sport peppers) on a poppy seed bun, cole slaw and soft drink for $8.   So sad-they hadn't made up the slaw yet. I chose chips, which were Jay's chips. Pretty weak choice there. Must be a Chicago thing.   The dog was awesome as always. Soft, fresh bun, big sausage, mustard, hot peppers, smothered in caramelized onions. It was epic. Keep those fire dogs coming!

Took our cat to the Emergency Animal Clinic in the middle of the night. Immediately we were overwhelmed by the caring staff. They cuddled our kitty, calling him by name and comforting him.   Of course once we had told them the basics of his emergency, they took him back while we finished the intake process.   I truly feel the Emergency Animal Clinic saved kitty's life and my entire family is grateful to them for their caring, urgent and compassionate approach during intake, care out outtake processes.   10 stars would be more appropriate to the service we received. Thanks!

Been to GJ a few times now.   The Adams street location is open on Saturday, despite what Yelp says.   I always get a good, professional cut, neck shave and balm for $18 plus tip. Mike does a good job with flat top cuts, so I always ask for him. They have a TV at each station. You can request programs but I usually go with what's on, since they are too fast (and nice) to catch all of one show anyway.   If you want a quick, clean, professional cut from a trained barber, come to Gentleman Joe's.

Been to GJ a few times now.   The Adams street location is open on Saturday, despite what Yelp says.   I always get a good, professional cut, neck shave and balm for $18 plus tip. Mike does a good job with flat top cuts, so I always ask for him. They have a TV at each station. You can request programs but I usually go with what's on, since they are too fast (and nice) to catch all of one show anyway.   If you want a quick, clean, professional cut from a trained barber, come to Gentleman Joe's.  Recently, I have been asking for Abraham since he has been doing an excellent job with my flattop. He is friendly and efficient.

First time at Il Vinaio but had to do take out due to other commitments. Arrived at 4:30pm on a Wednesday and it was deserted. Hostess obviously greeted me right away and accommodated me with a gluten free menu.   Since I did take out, she warned me that GF pasta takes 20 minutes. No prob there so she offered water during my wait.   Dinner arrived right on time: 20 minutes after she turned in the ticket. We ordered Classic Bruschetta on GF bread. It was toasted just right with herbaceous tomatoes on top. For entrees we got the Pasta Vinaio with GF pasta and Chicken Roulade (no gluten adjustments needed.). Each dish was well prepared with saucy goodness, goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes.   The total was $43 for two entrees and an app but for hard-to-find gluten free Italian, it was worth the price.   We will return when we have time to have a good sit down meal.

First time at Mellow Mushroom. Arrived at 11:45 on a Friday for lunch. There were about 20 guests already, so I sat in the bar.   Really good selection of eats and brews. I chose the lunch special: 8" pepperoni pizza for $4.99. I added one topping (jalapeños) and a drink for a total of $9.24 plus tip.   My lunch arrived in 15 minutes. It was piping hot (I burned the roof of my mouth) with plenty of mozzarella, sauce and toppings. The crust was soft but with a good, toasted bottom to it.   The service was exceptional, since she had to handle the entire bar area. She'd checked in on me appropriately and efficiently. The pizza was very good, but I should've ordered a sandwich to get faster service from the kitchen.   All in all, I recommend Mellow Mushroom for the food but for lunch: plan your time accordingly.

Another trip to MM. Tried the lunch special again but, on a recommendation, I went with the meatball sandwich. The lunch special comes with a half Sammie and chips. I added iced tea for $8.53 plus tip.   My meal arrived in six minutes. The Sammie was about 6" long with three good sized meatballs, marinara and mozzarella. The bread was toasted and there were plain kettle chips on the side. It was an excellent meal. The red sauce had good zing and the meatballs were tender, hot, juicy and seasoned nicely.   Jody did a very good job servicing the area. There were 20 guests just in his area and he kept up with everyone.   Recommend MM?  Absolutely!  The meatball sub? Definitely!

Tried MM on a Monday afternoon with the missus. We arrived at 3:30 and there were 20 guests inside and three servers. Good ratio.   My wife ordered wine and a GF pizza with two ingredients. I got an iced tea and a small mighty meat pizza. Check came to $42.36 plus tip. A lot for two 10" pies, wine and tea.   It arrived in 14 mins, piping hot as usual. Our server, JoAnna, was a bit slow with the service but when we asked for anything, she delivered. Rather undecided about her.   The GF pizza was disappointing. We've had a lot of GF pizzas, so we know good from bad. There was almost no sauce on it. In fact, my wife said she didn't want the leftovers until I told her I could make some marinara at home. My pie was very good tho. It had plenty of toppings, sauce and cheese.

Arizona Rattlers play at Talking Stick Arena downtown at 3rd St and Jefferson. They are in the Western Conference and have won three of the last four Arena Bowl Championships and five overall.   The Rattlers are led by Kevin Guy, an outstanding coach with a creative game plan. He calls the plays from the field but when he gets a big lead (which happens often) he lets he OC take over the play calling, giving him the experience.   Our quarterback, Nick Davila, is a multiple MVP and leads the dynamic offense. Jamie Dukes and Jeremy Kellem are the star defenders. We have led the league in offense for five years and are in the top five for defense every year as well.   Ticket prices are fair and there isn't a bad seat in the house. Go out and support your local AFL team. You'll witness high powered football and high energy crowds.

Been to this Sonic two or three times. Had a stand-out visit this morning. Lots of Yelpers bashing the service but not the case today.   Had to kill an hour for auto service so I got an Ultimate Meat and Cheese Breakfast Burrito. I was pleasantly surprised on multiple levels.   The service was fast, efficient and pleasant. My order arrived five minutes after ordering. My burrito was tightly wrapped (rarely seen) with all the yummy insides spread throughout (usually limited to egg on one side, tot, cheese, etc on the other.)  After I left, I realized I had forgotten to ask for either salsa or napkins. What's a breakfast burrito without salsa? Boring!  But lo, there, in the bag, were two salsa packets and two napkins, along with two mints for morning burrito breath!  This Sonic rocks the food and the service!

First time at The Duce. Small parking lot but not an issue at 11 AM on a Sunday.   I ordered a cheeseburger from the menu and she said they only serve sliders. Okay. I ordered the famous Mac N Cheese Muffins and she said they only have Bacon Mac N Cheese (for a slight upcharge). Okay. I added an Iced Tea and it came to $20.25 plus tip. That's a lot for sliders and 'fries'.   My lunch was ready in 8 mins. You have to find a table in the open-air place but then leave your drink to go back outside to get your food. Okay.   The sliders were a good size. They were juicy, with plenty of caramelized onions. They were very greasy tho. You can make juicy burgers without being greasy. I think they had the grill too low, so they pooled in fat.    The Bacon Mac N Cheese bites were okay but not spectacular. Again, extremely greasy. No topping crunch and no 'brown' spots on the bottom. They were either cooked too low or were old.   Probably won't return considering the price and quality.

First time at this IHOP. Been going to them for decades though.   I arrived around 8:45 on a Monday morning and it was about one quarter full, which was good to see.  My server quickly greeted me, offered coffee and asked for my drink order. After she brought my juice and water she took my order.   I got the country fried steak and eggs. I asked for extra gravy and toast instead of pancakes which she efficiently complied to. The order took 12 minutes, so I guess they had to batter the steak since it should only take about 4 minutes to fry it.   My plate arrived with the steak on top of the hash browns. At first I was stumped but then realized that there wouldn't have been room for the large portions otherwise.    The eggs were fluffy and buttery, the steak was fried to perfection, the hash browns were nicely crisped but tender on the inside and there was lots of gravy.   Good meal.

First time in over 5 years at BWW and now I remember why.   I arrived at 11:45 AM on a Thursday and there were 20 people in a place that seats 200-300.  Not a good sign.   The service was fine and deserving of more than two stars. The food deserved 1/2 star. I was immediately greeted and offer choice of table. My server, Mario, greeted me within 5 mins and serviced my table respectfully.   I ordered the 8 piece boneless wings, which come with fries, a dip and carrot plus a drink for $11. The wings were okay but not thoroughly sauced, surprisingly since there was no way one there. The bleu cheese was awful. If they make it: change the recipe. It tasted like bad bottled dressing. The fries were crisp but buried under wet carrots and celery, so they lot their crispness.   I doubt if I'll be back.

Giving BWW another go. Allison took care of me today and did an outstanding job. The place was empty again (11:45 on a Tuesday) so she should be able to.   I ordered the lunch special: Small wings with fries and a drink for $10.28 plus tip. Not bad.  I got the dry rub buffalo and it was very good. Perfect spice level, good crunch on the wings without the saucy mess. It came with 10 wings. The fries were good too. Still need to get better with the Bleu Cheese though. Compare it to the BC at Wingstop, no comparison.   All in all, my best visit yet. There's hope!  Thanks Allison.

First time at this Five Guys. Didn't even know it was here, tucked in the NE corner of Baseline and 24th St. I hadn't been to 5 Guys in years so I was excited to see this store.   Ordered 4 burgers and 3 fries on a Sunday. The online ordering  was clear, easy and fast. I arrived right on time and the burgers were ready but they said they didn't want to fire the fries until I arrived. Maybe a pain to some but it was a good call. They stayed hot and crispy during the drive home.   The burgers were all done exactly as ordered and were as good as I'd remembered. BTW, I recommend trying the malt vinegar on your fries if you haven't tried it. Takes it up a full notch.

First time at Jersey Mikes today. Arrived at 11:45 for lunch and there were a dozen guests plus three in line.   I ordered a regular Italian with no frills for $7.80 with tax. The service was efficient if a bit fast. Seemed they were competing with Jimmy Johns for speed. I like my meal in a hurry but I don't like to be rushed. The guy in line behind me was completely flustered since they talk so fast you can't hear or understand them. They also had to add some condiments to my sub that they had missed.   On to the food: the bread was fresh, baked just right with a slightly crunchy crust and soft middle. The veggies were crisp and the meat/cheese were sliced to order. The portions seemed a bit slight compared to Port of Subs but there were options, like pepper relish, that POS doesn't offer.   I will return to JM again and try a hot sandwich.

Came back to Mike's for an Italian sandwich today. The line moved quickly. In fact, as my sandwich was being finished, they hustled me thru the cashier and I didn't get to see that they screwed up my order. My toppings were not done as requested, which was a problem due to allergies. I had to toss the meal out when I got to work.   Mike: you might want to think that one through. Fast service isn't better than good service.

Been to Citizen Public House before but before Yelping.   Enjoyed dinner on a Wednesday eve and there were plenty of tables open (in June).  We were seated immediately and water was brought before we lifted our menus. Our server, ever attentive, checked on us for drinks shortly after.   I ordered a Hefeweizen while my wife enjoyed her Chardonnay. After drinks we ordered dinner: Scallops for my wife; Chopped Salad and Pork Osso Buco for me.   The salad, which is layered with: tomato/basil, fried pepitas, couscous, freeze dried corn, smoked salmon, chopped arugula, Asiago and buttermilk dressing. They offer to mix it but I like to mix mine so I can savor it more. The pop of the couscous, corn and pepitas, the cool salmon, the peppery arugula, tangy tomato/basil, salty asiago and creamy dressing!  It is heaven, with the flavors, textures, scents, mouth-feel, satisfying sensations. A must try.   The scallops were seared perfectly and must've been brined cuz they were as tender as butter. The Osso Buco never needed a knife. It came with a rich Demi glace, braised kale and creamy polenta.   The total bill was $88 plus tip. I've now run thru three dishes over time and must try more!

Another visit, this time solo after work. I arrived at 5 on a Thursday eve and it was nearly empty. Scottsdale is a late-night town, so no worries here.   I was given water and menus right away. The hostess announced that it was happy hour, so I was 'coerced' into a beer.   Sam approached me shortly later and offered to explain the menu. I wasn't very hungry so I ordered the Chopped Salad and the Chia Seed Seared Ahi Tuna.   My salad arrived in 5 minutes. The salad I've had numerous times and there are dozens of reviews about it so I'll focus on the Ahi.   It arrived shortly after my salad bowl was cleared. It was presented with micro greens, fried leeks and an asparagus gastric. The Ahi was seated nicely and was a good portion. Pretty good but not great. I was pining for the fondues that surrounded me.   Sam was genuinely happy to greet all his guests and made me feel like an important part of the clientele. Very good customer skills.

First time at PF Chang's in years. Tuesday evening and the place was still 1/3 full-good sign. My wife and I were seated in five minutes and we were quickly greeted.   Our server, Zachary, offered us drinks and went thru the seasonal menu. We ordered from the gluten free menu, so we couldn't take him up on any specials, since none of them were GF.   My wife ordered a glass of wine and I got a pot of Dragon Eye Oolong tea. The drinks were served in 7 minutes. The tea was rather spectacular. Good herbal notes with a definite citrus finish.   We had also ordered Chang's signature appetizer: lettuce cups. Tasty marinated chicken, water chestnuts and green onions served over crispy rice noodles and a side of lettuce. Delicious.   Our entrees arrived after 15 more minutes. My bride of 30 years ordered the GF Singapore Street Noodles while I ordered a cup of Hot and Sour Soup (not GF) and GF Chang's Spicy Chicken. The noodles were better than ordinary chow mien: the noodles were pan-fried, giving them great texture. There were plenty of shrimps and chicken pieces. The Spicy Chicken was their version of General's Chicken. Not as crunchy as GC but very good. A bit sweet so I just added Sriracha to it.   Zachary did an outstanding job keeping the table clean and his guests happy. Our dinner totaled $53 before tip.   We will he returning.

First time at this Filiberto's. Have always had good food and decent service at the others. This one was no exception.   Arrived around 7:30PM on a Sunday night and I noticed that the place was different than all the others. This place had seating for about 40-50, salsa bar, condiment bar and chips/sauce bar. Nice touch.   My wife ordered the rolled taco plate with all the toppings on the side. I got the Adobado plate but with no beans (date night ya know). She enjoyed her tacos. Crispy tortillas, flavorful meat and fresh toppings. The rice was exceptional, compared to other Fili B's.   My Adobado was unctuous. It was juicy and seemed to have some extra flavor that I couldn't describe. My wife took a bite and wasn't fond of it but she also couldn't describe the taste.   I recommend this Filiberto's for its savory dishes, good atmosphere and efficient service.

Caught up with Hey Joe for some delicious Filipino food!  There were four of us and we all ordered the same dish: pork belly.  Four big pieces of seared pork belly, served with seasoned rice, daikon radish and carrot/jalapeño slaw plus dipping sauce. Yum.  Saw someone coming away with a monster lumpia that wasn't on the menu. Wish I knew- I love lumpia.  It was about 8" long and stuffed to the brim. Missed opportunity there! The pork belly was crisp yet juicy, perfect for the vinegary dipping sauce. The slaw was outstanding and the sticky rice was good too.  Highly recommend Hey Joe, especially the pork belly.

Hadn't been to Thai Patio in a few months so we gave it one more shot to fix painfully slow service. In past visits (5-6) we have waited 20-35 minutes for our meal.   Today, with four full tables and 3 to-go orders, it took only 9 minutes - WIN!  We ordered the Larb, Chicken Wings, Beef Pad Thai and Chicken Yellow Curry. Due to allergies, we ordered all if them without onions and the only negative effect was the Larb. They compensated with extra basil/mint and cilantro. Wow it was, um, pungent. Everything else was spot on.   Good Thai food and fast service. That's what we wanted!  Thanks for listening Thai Patio.  Now, if they would only get a website so we could order ahead online.

I tried the New York Steamer at Firehouse subs today - wow, that was a lot of flavor.  They start with a soft-baked roll, 8" or 12". They pile it high with corned beef and pastrami, melt some provolone on top and then dress it with mustard, mayo and Italian dressing.  I recommend getting those toppings.  They add just the right zing and juiciness. A dill spear arrives on the side.  Even with a full house, my lunch was ready in eight minutes. Yay.

I've been to several Firehouse Subs in the valley but this is the first time for me at this one. Business took me to the West side today.   I ordered my fave: a #3 Steamer which has pastrami and corned beef on it. The crew did their usual efficient, friendly service and my lunch was ready in six minutes, despite the nearly full restaurant. The steamer tray they use at FS makes the meats hot without drying anything out.   My meal was the perfect contrast to a rather difficult day at work. The bread was fresh and soft, the meat, juicy and abundant and the toppings crisp and fresh. FS always offers a huge selection of hot sauces to sample. I'm a big fan since I like fiery sauce.   Try Firehouse Subs for a delicious, quick bite.

First time at Texas BBQ House. Definitely not my last.   Ordered 1/2 pound moist brisket, 1/2 jalapeño sausage link, Texas cream corn and a soda for $18.31.   Let's go backwards: the soda is huge and the cream corn: very tasty. It has loads of dairy in it but it was warm and satisfying. The link was a good size for a 1/2 link. It had great snap and good jalapeño flavor. The brisket: the best I've had in the West, and I've had a lot of brisket.   For a valley comparison, Tom's BBQ is like a Chevy: it'll get you there but with no frills. Allison's BBQ in Mesa is a Cadillac: running in style with no complaints. Texas BBQ House: jump into a Bentley, with a chauffeur included!  It was lightly smokey, tender with a good mix of fat and bark. I couldn't set my fork down!  My only regret is that I only got 1/2 pound. Oh that's right, I bought a pound to go. My original plan was to eat some there and take some home. It didn't work out (too tasty to stop) so I had to get more.  Mike, you are a craftsman and my stomach thanks you.

First time at Thai Basil. The four of us arrived around 4:00 PM on a Saturday and it was almost empty. By the time we left, it was half full, which was a good sign.   We ordered our meals family style so we could try different dishes. First up - Larb. We ordered pork Larb and it arrived piled on top of the lettuce, which prevented us from eating it as a wrap. Overall it was tasty tho.   We also ordered Yellow Curry Chicken. It arrived with a bowl of steamed rice. Nothing good or bad about the YCC-very traditional.   The Grilled Pork Sausage was disappointing. I guess I should've seen it coming but, first of all, it arrived after we finished everything else. Second, it was not very appetizing. I guess I was expecting a grilled sausage that was ground up and presented nicely. It was a sausage with some disjointed garnishes. Didn't like.   The Shrimp Pad Thai was excellent. Very well done, with about 6-7 shrimps. Very well put together.  Our service was excellent and could not have been better.

Return visit to Thai Basil. Still not as highly successful as the TB in Chandler but still good. I arrived at 11:15 on a Monday and there were 10 tables full.   The service, once again was excellent. I was greeted at the door and offered a table, brought water and a salad within 3 mins.   I tried a new dish based on Yelp reviews: Pad See Ew. The dish was good but not great. I think my issue was with the sauce: it was rather bland.  Also the noodles were so roughly chopped that the dish looked like a hot mess. It had about 3 ounces of beef, three small broccoli spears and a few carrots and onions mixed in as well.   Again, good tasting but not great. All told it came to $9.76 plus tip.

First time at ATB. Ordered the Big Tex, which comes with three meats and two sides. I ordered the chopped brisket, ribs and link, with cornbread soufflé and cole slaw and Texas toast.   Sides first: the cole slaw was okay. Not much pop but a good amount of dressing. The cornbread was excellent. Wished I got two of those. The Texas toast, which comes with all meals, was buttery and nicely toasted.   The entrees: the ribs fell off the bone and tasty but just a bit dry. Sauce helped. The link was disappointing. Not much heat, very small and over cooked, making it very dry. The chopped brisket was excellent. Some bark was included (my fave part) and the meat was smoked to perfection   The sauces: I don't know which sauces were included but the sweet sauce was WAAAAY too sweet. I liked the raspberry notes but it was so cloying that I couldn't taste the meat. I dipped my toast in it cuz it was like sweet jam. The other sauce (either spicy or sassy) was nice.   Quick service, better than ave food. I'll try it again.

Hadn't been to Carraba's in years and first time at this one.   We called ahead and put ourselves on the wait list but when we arrived at 7:00 PM our table was ready. We were given water and menus right away and Cody greeted us soon after.   Without apps, we a ordered our meals and drinks together. My wife ordered the Baked Salmon with garlic mashed pots and a glass of Chardonnay. Our daughter ordered the Sirloin with garlic mash plus champagne and her husband got the Chicken Trio,  garlic mash and a glass of merlot. I ordered the Chicken Trio, but subbed one type of chicken (prosecco for Marsala) with garlic mash.   Our salads and soup arrived quickly. The soup (lentil sausage) was excellent, as recommended by our server. The salads were fresh, crisp, cold and portioned right.   The meals arrived about 10 mins later. My trio got mixed up: they left the Marsala on the plate and took out the Chicken Maria. Too bad. The Prosecco Chicken was the highlight, with crispy coating, juicy insides and flavorful profile. The Chicken Bryan is always a fave of mine too.   Cody did an excellent job with our table, refilling half-empty glasses, apologizing for the mistake with the Marsala and generally keeping up a good conversation. I planned on mentioning him to the manager but it was very busy and folks were waiting for our table by the time we were done.

First time at North. Had lunch on a Sunday afternoon, drawn to the gluten free options.    For the six of us, we ordered the Happy Hour Bottle and Board, Steamed Muscles, Fonduta, Beet Salad, Tuscan Basil Tomato Soup (2), a side of pasta, Spaghetti and the daily Pizza. We also added a glass of Malbec Red Wine and two cokes for $114. Only $19 per person including apps and drinks. Good deal there.   The charcuterie board was excellent. It had salami, spicy pepperoni, two cheeses, garlicky olives, candied apricot bits, asparagus, bread and some tasty nuts.   For the meals, everyone enjoyed their plate. Mine was the pizza - a white pizza with smoked mozzarella, pepperoni and basil. It was the first white pizza I'd had in 20 years. Excellent pie.   The service is definitely worth mentioning: Melissa gave us the perfect amount of attention, made menu suggestions, had good rapport with her customers and a charming smile. She made our meal better!  We will be returning, with more guests!

Many-year Smash veteran but first time at this one. I know Friday lunch crowds can be big, so I ordered ahead online.   The online process was efficient, easy and fast. I was offered a time slot 15 mins ahead. I arrived on schedule and there were 18 5th graders in line. So glad I ordered ahead cuz I just stepped up to the quick counter and was gone in 4 mins.   I created my own burger, adding cheese, bacon and a side of buffalo fries for less than $9.50.   Burger was done right and they had tossed in a couple packs of ketchup plus a small tub of ranch. I don't like either but it was still a nice touch.   This Smash has got it together. Go but if you don't mind eating at your desk at work or dining table at home, order ahead. You could always unwrap it and eat it there!

First time at the Breakfast Club. Hard to find cuz it doesn't face the street. Park nearby and walk up the steps between Central, 1st St., Jefferson and Washington. Nice plaza plus seating inside. The furniture outside was pretty beat up tho.   Upscale breakfast with darkly dressed hostesses and servers. My server greeted me right away but sadly spent much of her time with the bigger tables.   I ordered a large juice and the Breakfast Grilled Cheese. It came with hash browns, two eggs, and bacon on a grilled cheese.   The sandwich was disappointing. It was boring. One slice of cheese, way too much under cooked hash browns and no seasoning. No fruit on the side. No garnish. Nothing. Just $7.50 for a boring sandwich and $7 for a glass of juice.   They are charging their customers for their location. Just because they dress everyone in black does not make it high end. I will be recommending my friends NOT to bother with this over priced, over valued, over dressed stop.

Tried Burger King a few times with mixed results. Finally a visit worthy of a review.   I was greeted cheerily and he efficiently took my order. I got the Four Cheese Whopper, fries and a drink for $7.90. A better price than nearby Carl's Jr. so here's hoping it's still good quality!  To my delight, it was excellent. I don't mean to gush over a burger and fries but, as fast food goes, it was really good. The bun was fresh, the patty was flame-broiled tasty, the veggies were crisp and just the right amount of sauce. The fries were fluffy and crisp with salt just right. You couldn't improve upon it. The service was outstanding as well.   I don't know if I've been missing out on a good restaurant or just a good sandwich, so stay tuned for an update: I work a 1/2 mile away.

First time at Can't Stop Smoking BBQ. Dropped in on a Saturday around noon. There were four people eating in this huge place. Hmm, not a good sign.   There were plenty of options so I chose them all!  I got a sampler plate (#7 on the menu) that came with pulled pork, pork ribs, brisket, sausage, two sides and choice of bread. I got Mac N Cheese plus coleslaw and a jalapeño cornbread muffin. It was $16.   The only way to break this down is to rate each item. Pulled pork: 4 stars; ribs: 5; brisket: 5, sausage: 3, Mac: 5, slaw: 5, muffin: 4. Value: 4. Nothing was 'bad' but some were more bland than others, like the sausage. The pulled pork, sausage and cornbread were about as good as what I make on my Weber at home. The rest of them were better than mine (Mac was way better!)  The atmosphere was very teen-centric, as was the cafeteria setup. Something can be said for a long line winding past a worn butcher block with a pit master working the knife and fork. None of that here.

First time at Tom's Thumb. Perhaps last.  I arrived at 5 PM on a Monday and was the only customer aside from the cashiers kids doing their homework. The cashier joked twice about the place being empty. Perhaps a sign?  I ordered the Two-meat Platter that came with two sides. I got brisket and sausage plus Mac N Cheese and Sweet Potato Fries for the sides. I added a small drink for $16.51 plus tip. Not pricey for good BBQ but they were very small portions. I just got hit for a $17 car wash (before tip) outside, which was a couple bucks more than everyone else. Ouch.   Service in the restaurant was great, other than the wisecracking about being empty. The service at the car wash was 10-minutes slow. Too bad there.   The link was good. Good flavor, good snap (a must) but a bit small. The brisket was VERY dry. I got two really small strips (like 1" wide strips) that were so lean and dry I could barely eat them. Perhaps yesterday's batch?  Fortunately a customer came in and I heard the cashier tell him that the BBQ sauce was 'around the corner'. Thank goodness or I would've tossed most of the brisket.   The fries were very tasty. Good flavor, crunchy exterior yet fluffy inside. The Mac was off. It was way undercooked, plus had an off taste. I had three bites.   Even my little $1.29 drink came with no refills according to the sign, unless you want to pay more!  I drove 15 miles from work, in the opposite direction of home, only to be majorly disappointed.   Prob no revisit, sadly, cuz I love BBQ.

First time at Yogi's Grill.   Arrived at 11:40 for lunch on a Friday and there were seven tables full - good sign. I ordered the Chicken Katsu Plate and a drink for $12.87 with tax.   The soft drink/condiments station was set up well. The machine for drinks gives you 100's of choices. For condiments there were so many options I can't even start to describe them all. I got some Sriracha in a cup for dipping.   My lunch arrived in 6 minutes. It had a good portion of Katsu chicken (about 6 oz) on rice with a teriyaki drizzle, two pieces of California roll and a small salad.   The chicken was hot, crispy and flavorful. The rice was sticky enough for chop sticks and the teriyaki drizzle was light enough to keep the Katsu flavor in the forefront. The salad was good, with s sesame ginger dressing. The sushi was dreadful however. It was far from fresh, made with cheap seafood and most of it was tossed out.   I recommend Yogi's Grill for the Chicken Katsu but use caution with the sushi.

Good burger today. Ordered a small burger with bacon and cheese plus the free condiments, like Frank's Hot Sauce and sliced jalapeños. My wife has gluten issues, so we ordered a lettuce wrap for her, with pickles, tomatoes and spreads.  They forgot her tomatoes. When you don't get much on your burger, you want want you order.   Fries are always good at 5 Guys.

First time at Osaka tonight, celebrating Valentine's Day. We arrived 1/2 hour early so we could get drinks and the hostess said they were running ahead but we could head for the bar and she would come get us.   We waited 10 minutes at our table in the bar but our server passed us up 5-6 times while avoiding eye contact. Even the bar, which was 'cleared' by patrons leaving for their tables, never got cleared of dirty dishes. Seems they need to add service in the bar area (the only reason I gave this review only 4 stars).  We were seated at our Teppanyaki table with two other groups: a couple and a party of six. The party of six knew a worker at Osaka so he came out and brought them bottles of bubbly sake. He then saw us looking longingly at the bottles and brought us some as well-nice touch. It was very good.   Our chef, Leo, was excellent. We asked for Gluten Free soy sauce and he cooked our meal on one side of the grill, while he cooked everyone else's in the middle and other side. That was cool since he had ten meals to serve.   My wife got the Teppanyaki Filet Mignon and Scallops and I ordered the Filet with shrimp. We got a cold house salad and hot broth soup, fried rice, grilled veggies and the entrees. We were stuffed!  The filets were cooked perfectly and the scallops and shrimp were excellent as well.   I recommend Osaka for any occasion but make reservations like we did, that place is busy!

Update: Recently I posted a review regarding a definite lack of 'double meat'. Went back last night and got much better results, without saying anything to them.   My only problem now is the online ordering system, which sometimes works and sometimes not. They really need to fix that since it adds 10 mins onto a takeout order.

First time at this Pei Wei and first at any in about 5 years. The menu has obviously changed. The ordering system was simple. You order the size, the protein and the style but I think it would make a lot more sense to order the style (Pad Thai, Mongolian Beef, etc.) first.   I asked what sizes they had and the guy says: "We have lunch size and a bigger one."  Okay. I ordered a lunch sized Mongolian Beef.   My faux hawk 'server' dropped it off without a hint of pleasure in his face. Sad that he is working angry.   My entree arrived with about 3 ounces of beef, six pieces of beef!  It was mostly rice. They had a good condiment section tho, with Chinese mustard, Sambal Oelek and soy sauce.   The drinks are also good, with the auto select dispenser.   While eating I overheard faux hawk mocking other guests to a coworker and almost smiled while bashing his paying customer. Almost.   Can't recommend this Pei Wei.

First time at ATH. Arrived around 3 on a Saturday afternoon. The place was still half full. Impressive. We ordered a beer plus a beer flight and then got an Avocado salad, the Mess (poutine), an Outlaw Burger and the Pizza special (Paisano).   My meal was: sharing the mess and the flight plus pizza. The mess was excellent. Very savory gravy over fries and no shortage of cheese curds.   Order it!  The pizza was outstanding with red sauce, smoked mozzarella, caramelized onions, sausage, pepperoni and arugula. The arugula took it over the top and balanced the oils of the meats perfectly. The smoked mozzarella came thru and really gave a good lingering taste.   They have seating inside and out. Late April, overcast: we chose out and it was perfect. Our server was attentive and helped our experience.   I recommend Angels Trumpet House for a great trendy, tasty filling meal.

First time at Jersey Mike's. Ordered to-go for the family: an Original Italian for me, Turkey and Provolone for my wife, a BLT for our daughter and a Buffalo Chicken Wrap for her husband.   Our sandwiches were made on time, which was refreshing for this area: we usually have to wait for take-out orders despite arriving at the appointed time.   I ordered the Italian because Port-of-Subs has a similar sandwich that I had had the day before and I wanted to compare. My sandwich was good, but not as good as PoS. I liked the red pepper spread. It was fresh but I think the bread was the difference.   My son-in-law said his Buffalo Chicken was okay. He had better and had worse.   I'll try Jersey Mike's again. It is in a convenient location, the service is very good and the selection is okay. Maybe a different meal next time?

First time at this Smashburger. Kinda weird tho: 6:00 PM on a Monday and I'm the only customer. The Smash by my old house in Las Sendas was always packed from 4:00 PM until closing. Win for me I guess.   Ordered two burgers to go. Obviously I got fast service with no other customers. Cashier tried a soft upsell, which I am always fine with hearing. I declined though. I ordered a regular sized burger on a chipotle bun and my wife got a regular with a lettuce bun.   Her burger was a bit disappointing though because the lettuce was very small, forcing her to eat it with knife and fork, instead of a lettuce wrap.   Mine was fine, with fresh ingredients and toppings.   I'll try this Smash again but will check her lettuce wrap before leaving the restaurant.

Had the chicken satay at the Satay Hut. Very good, especially with the spicy peanut sauce that accompanies it.  The peanut sauce could be a lot hotter before they offend anyone but it was still tasty.  Meat was tender but with charred bits. Good stuff.

First time at Pig and Pickle.  Arrived around 4:30 PM on a Saturday and there were only about a dozen there. There were a lot of sports events going on locally.   We were promptly seated by the overdressed hostess and offered menus and water. Thomas greeted us shortly after to offer drinks.   For food we got a charcuterie plate and a side salad to start.  Since it was happy hour, the salad was upgraded to a Dump Truck Salad. For the charcuterie meats it had: chorizo, salami, pork belly terrine, smoked salmon and tazzo ham. For pickled veggies: okra, green beans, pickles, grapes, onions and eggs.  It also had house made: mustard, bacon jam, sourdough bread (not very sour) , apricot spread and butter. The plate was outstanding, with kudos to the pork belly terrine plus the pickles.   For entrées, we ordered 'The Nancy', a cheddar bacon burger, a bowl of Mussels and the Shrimp and Grits. Everyone raved about their meal. For me, the shrimp were good, plus it had lots of chorizo slices and the grits were killer. Cheesy, thick, buttery, good spice and a flavorful broth. I'd order it again in a heartbeat. All in all, along with Thomas's excellent service, a perfect meal.

Many times at Wingstop but first time at this location.   I ordered the eight piece lunch special which comes with wing, fries, dipping sauce (ranch or bleu cheese) and a medium drink. Leftover wings baby. Wings took the standard 14 minutes. The fries at Wingstop are always a crapshoot: sometimes they're fresh and sometimes limp. This time: fresh, hot, skin on fries with just the right amount of seasoned salt.   The wings were spot on: big, hot, juicy and loaded with sauce/rub. I got four Hot and four Cajun. I recommend both, along with Louisiana Rub.   I have always recommended Wingstop over the years and I add this location to the list. Service was friendly, snappy and professional. Any time you are in the Tempe Marketplace area, drive West one mile and try Wingstop. You'll be glad you did.

Tried Hao Bao at the Street Eats. Ordered two batches of dumplings (pot stickers for Americans). Took quite a while and it was a bit steep on price.  Dumplings were crisp, juicy and tender. Was hoping for more punch on the flavor profile. I added soy sauce, vinegar and red chili paste to mine which brought it up to snuff, especially the vinegar.  Keep working on the recipe guys and don't be afraid to offer regular and spicy dumplings.  Good overall and I would try again, perhaps with something else to accompany the dumplings.

First time at Matt' Big Breakfast. Arrived at 10:15 on a Saturday morning and waited 20 mins: much less than most reviewers.   My son-in-law and I both ordered identical breakfasts: the special meal and drink of the day. We each got the Three Egg omelette with Schriner's Chorizo a jalapeños and it came with potatoes. We both got a side of sausage and a Strawberry Honey Lemonade.   It arrived in about 10 mins. The eggs were nicely cooked and the potatoes were cooked crispy, just as I prefer them. The sausage were a bit small for the price but I got full anyway. The drink was too sweet and would've been better without the honey.    Overall a good experience. I will bring my gluten-intolerant wife and see what she thinks next time.

Had the grilled cheese with tomato jam at Paradise Melts at the Street eats in Scottsdale. Awesome sandwich.  I'm guessing it was either country white or potato bread, I didn't ask. Bread was buttered and toasted edge-to-edge, like any self respecting griller should be.  The tomato jam was a nice foil for the butter. Just the right amount so it didn't overpower the star-all that gooey, melted cheese.  Service was a bit slow, even though the line was extremely short. Don't know where they went wrong there.  I will try it again.

First time I sat down in a Barros. I've done takeout several times for my celiac daughter.   We arrived at 10:30 on a Saturday night and there were still 5 full tables. Pretty cool that they stay open until 11.   We ordered a gluten free pizza and some wings. The pizza is always special because we know it is safe from glutens, which always take out my daughter. The pizza was hot, with a chewy crust and plenty of fresh toppings.   The wings were exceptional. I had never had them here before but I won't make that mistake again. We ordered a dozen bone in wings with hot sauce. They arrived in about 10 mins piping hot, plenty of spicy sauce and good, meaty wings.   Our service, even tho they wanted to close the restaurant, was pleasant and accommodating.  I recommend this Barros for a solid late meal with good service.

First time at Squid Ink. Stopped for pre-movie dinner for three on a Friday night. Arrived at 6:30, before happy hour ended and got good deals on beer and some rolls.   The restaurant was fairly full so we took seats at the sushi bar and were seated right away. Our server was training a new server and it did not detract from our experience in any way.   We ordered drinks, two apps and seven rolls and the bill came to $68 before tip which was a really good deal. I got a beer, shared the garlic edamame and potstickers and then ordered a spicy crab roll and spicy tuna roll.   The edamames were very good with a perfect dusting of kosher salt and some cloves of roasted garlic. They were steamed just right. The potstickers were amazing. There were five of them and they came in a tasty teriyaki sauce with scallions that was divine. The pork filling was cooked perfectly and had a hint of garlic.   My rolls were big, fresh and cool while the cucumber was crisp and bright. The best touch was the black sesame seeds mixed into the rice, which gave it a great nutty taste that rounded out the flavor. It was just the perfect touch.   I recommend Squid Ink for an evening dinner or late night snack.

First time at Phoenix Public Market Cafe. We arrived at 10:30AM so only breakfast was being served. By the time we finished, the line was 25 deep for lunch.   My wife ordered the Rooster Booster (eggs, bacon, toast and potatoes while I got the Devil's Mess. We also ordered iced tea and a Bloody Mary. We had to wait 10 mins for a table and then had to sit there while service cleaned it, rather than lose the precious seating. Tables were at a premium. Our breakfast arrived 5 mins later.   The RB was your basic Grand Slam but with better bacon. The DM was unique, with chorizo, chiles and veggies (spinach) mixed in. The eggs on both plates were cooked right, the toast was good, with a farmers jam on the side. Very filling meal.   The Tea was weird. I tried the prickly pear tea and it was rather bland. My wife said the Bloody Mary was excellent. Crushed salt and pepper in the rim was a classy touch.   We will try PPMC again, perhaps for lunch but when it's cooler cuz the AC struggled.

Ate on the patio for the first time. Nice shade for all tables.   My wife ordered the Baked Sweet Potato and a Bloody Mary while I got the Grilled Cheese, Fries and Iced Tea. Lunch arrived in about 10 minutes and everything was very good (nothing but crumbs left).   I noticed another table with some kind of seasoned fries. Pequin Devil Fries that I didn't see it on the menu. They looked awesome.   The weather was nice, good food, good company, full belly.   Life is good.

Many times at PPM but first time for dinner. Four of us dined on: a shared plate of Devil's Fries, a couple of AZ Burgers, the Pulled Pork Sammie and I got the BBQ Sampler Platter.   The fries were excellent. Crispy exterior, fluffy insides, topped with feathery parm, garlic and three sauces. My sampler was excellent as well. The chicken was nicely seasoned, the pulled pork had great smoke flavor and the cornbread?  OMG the bakery there is unreal. The cornbread was sweet, fluffy, moist...everything you wished your cornbread was!  We got a slice of Double Chocolate Cake to go but it didn't make it out the door. We ate it in about 40 seconds. (Should've ordered milk!). So we got six macaroons to go. There were Strawberries and Cream,  Salted Caramel, Lemon Hibiscus and another flavor that I forgot the name. The macaroons are different the your mama's. Try them. You'll wish you bought more. They should give the pastry chef a raise!  The service was a bit off tonight. Gina did a good job at our table but her 'helpers' weren't much help. We ran out of silverware, drinks and napkins. It was busy so I'll cut some slack for that.

First time at Snooze today. Sunday, 10 AM, place packed but the wait was only a half hour for the six of us. (As we left, I heard the host say it was an hour and a half wait.)  Read lots of reviews about bad service but they seem to have fixed that issue. Our server promptly greeted us, offering menus and drinks.   After we all arrived, our server offered to answer any questions about the menu. She took our orders, which were: Breakfast Pot Pie, Juan's Breakfast Taco trio, Snooze Spuds Deluxe (2), Breakfast Burrito and Ham Benedict III.   They all looked and smelled wonderful. My Benedict was excellent: toasty English muffin, lots of chopped ham, poached egg and cheesy hollandaise sauce. It also came with hash browns. I asked for them crispy and they were perfect.   The hollandaise was lacking the tang of lemon but was much more savory than normal.   During our meal, a balloon-animal dude was cruising the place, keeping the kids happy.   Give Snooze a try but plan on a wait. There are some shops nearby, which help pass the wait time.

First time at George and Sons. Came here on recommendation and dragged her here for confirmation.   We arrived at noon on a Tuesday and there were only 4 empty tables which was a good sign. We ordered our drinks, which arrived promptly but then our glasses were ignored until we were ready for the check.   I got the lunch special General Yang's Chicken, which came with Egg Drop Soup, Rice, a small Egg Roll, a small Crab Puff and, of course, the entree. Plenty to eat for $8.   The chicken was plenty hot, plenty crisp, too sweet but overall it was good. We never saw our server again and had to flag down the hostess to get our check.   I give the food 4 1/2 stars, the service 1 star, so why 4 stars overall?  Because George was walking the floor, checking on his customers. That says that he cares. He needs to check his own servers however and then he will be packed for lunch.   I recommend George's but be prepared to wait.

Tried George's again after a few months. Went solo on a Tuesday evening. I arrived at 5 and there was one other customer. Too early?  I ordered Crab Puffs, Hot and Sour Soup and General Yang's Chicken. The puffs arrived in 5 mins. All six were hot and fresh. More cream cheese/scallion than cream cheese/crab flavor.  Still good tho. The soup, which was very hot, had just the right amount of pork plus a big shrimp in the cup.   The Yang's Chicken was excellent. It was extremely spicy (yay), crispy (yay) and not as sweet as last visit (yay). Very good dish, if you like spice, which I do.   The only thing that was off:  the 80s music. They spent a lot of thought making the place look oriental and then they pipe in loud Billy Joel. Some quality oriental music would've been preferable.

Another visit to see George, with equal success. I brought a coworker and he ordered Orange Chicken whilst I ordered Yang's Chicken again.   Our server brought soup very quickly. It was pretty standard egg drop soup. Our entrées arrived soon after we finished our soup.   The lunch special comes with a small veggie egg roll that is forgettable but the rest of the meal, oh my. My coworker said four to five times: "This is probably the best Chinese I've ever had," as he cleaned his plate. The entrée also comes with rice, lo mien, a single Crab Rangoon and the main.   My Yang's chicken was crispy yet tender on the inside. The sauce was exceptional, with perfect sweet to heat balance.   Our server was very attentive despite a very full floor. I highly recommend George and Sons for really good Chinese food.

First time at this Fired Pie but several visits in the valley.   Arrived at 5:15 PM on a Thursday and there was no line, which was unusual for this place. I ordered two pizzas, one for me and a gluten free for my wife.   We both got pepperoni, spicy sausage and various veggies, along with marinara and pesto sauces, mozzarella and fontina cheeses (unlimited toppings for $7.95, +$2 for gluten free crust).  The pies came out bubbly and nicely toasted. The veggies were fresh, the meats were plentiful. The sauce had good aromas to them.   I highly recommend Fired Pie for an inexpensive, flavorful pizza.

My recent trip to Chipotle was definitely disappointing. Ordered $60 worth of food and got $10 worth of service, due to the idiots that are often staffed on Sundays.   We ordered take out and waited the ordained 40 minutes to leave the house for the ultra-slow Laveen location, even tho the Chipotle near my house in Mesa takes 10 minutes. Upon arriving 10 minutes after the online promise time, they hadn't even started the order.   My carnitas order was missing sour cream and guacamole, which costs more. My daughter, who has a severe gluten allergy, received no apology when they forgot to switch out spoons and gloves. They just laughed and said "Oops".  My tip to management: call 'Restaurant Undercover' and see what is really going on cuz you just lost a weekly $60 sale from our family.

Came to WingStop on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed. Good for business and my wings only took 13 minutes.   I ordered the 10 piece combo (leftovers!) with fries and a drink, plus extra bleu cheese for dipping my fries. For the wings I got Original Hot and Cajun Rub (1/2 & 1/2).    The fries at WingStop are always a gamble: sometimes they are perfect, with a fresh batch of oil and done just right but sometimes you get limp, older fries. Mine were the good kind.   The wings were fantastic. They were hot, crispy, plenty of sauce/rub and meaty.   The service deserves a shout out. Around 51st Ave. and Baseline, you usually get the high school student who doesn't give a rip about service or the customer. Today at WingStop I received exceptional service, even with 30 people in a place that holds 50. They were pleasant, attentive, patient and did a great job.   I'll be back for more great wings.

Another visit. Came at 11:30 for lunch on a Wednesday and there were seven others. The guy in front of me in line had no clue, since he hadn't been here before but the cashier was so busy keeping his cool on that the guest had to repeatedly ask twice.   My eight piece combo, for $11.14, arrived in 12 minutes. They are always hot, crisp and delicious. The fries were good but with lots of very small pieces.  The Bleu Cheese (my choice) was cool.   I recommend Wing Stop but the cashier needs to serve the customers how he was trained to and not worry so much about keeping his aura of cool up. He's just a cashier!

Repeat visit, much better service. The wings are never in question, but sometimes you get the high school kid that's all about themselves.   Tonight the cashier was attentive, engaging, on her game and efficient. What else could you want?  The wings were spot on epic as usual. The fries are often a gamble but tonight they were good. The Bleu cheese dressing is always good, with chunks of cheese throughout.   All in all, this Wingstop has worked it out right. Thanks!

First time at Fired Pie today. Met my daughter for lunch. We arrived at 2:00 PM on a Monday and there were about 8 other tables. Good sign to be this busy after the lunch rush.   I ordered a pie with tomato sauce and pesto, mozzarella and fontina cheeses, pepperoni and spicy sausage, jalapeños and onions. Forgot to get fresh basil on top. My daughter ordered similar but with a couple of topping changes.   The line moved very quickly so we built, paid and filled our drinks within seven minutes. The pizzas came about seven minutes after that.   I'm not a thin crust guy. Never liked it, never will. I don't like deep dish either. I prefer regular, Hungry Howie's-type crust but thin is all they offer at Fired Pie.  We ate here because I just got laid off and I wanted a cheap meal for our weekly dad/daughter date. All their build-a-pizzas are $7.95.   Wow, I found a thin crust that I love!  It wasn't "cracker crisp" like I've seen at other places, thank goodness. It was cooked perfectly. The sauce-to-crust ratio was spot on. The toppings were toasted and flavorful. You guys nailed it!    Came home tonight and told my wife all about it and she wants in on the pie!  Our other daughter, who has celiac disease, can't eat here. Even tho they have gluten free dough, they prep it on the same boards and cook it in the same ovens, which is bad for celiac sufferers.

Sunnyside Breakfast Lounge has clearly gotten past the opening jitters and have stepped up their game.    I stopped in for lunch today and was quickly greeted by Elena. She offered booth or table, then asked about drinks. Good start!  After my iced tea arrived, I ordered the Red Mountain Burger, which came with some nicely seasoned fries. The burger was a bit over cooked but still very juicy, served on a pretzel bun. I scarfed it all down.  Elena checked in on me just the right amount to assure all was well, without being pushy. Executive Chef Garfio also checked with the tables, which was a great touch.   If Yelp allowed individual ratings like Trip Advisor does, I would give them: 5 overall; 4 for food (-1 for over cooked); 5 for service and 5 for quality and 5 for value.   Good job Sunnyside!

Arrived at 11:40 for a Friday lunch. There were five other tables full-good sign!  I was greeted quickly and offered a menu. I ordered the two roll lunch special with spicy crunchy tuna roll and spicy crab roll and then I added miso soup and iced tea for $10.00.   Sushi is an art and takes time to craft but my soup arrived in 4 mins, even tho there was only one chef and one waiter. They were advertising for more help and that's good cuz he was very busy since four more tables filled up.   The soup was very good with strong miso flavor, spring onions and tofu. It was hot and satisfying.   My rolls arrived 8 mins later which was faster than I expected. The spicy crunchy tuna roll was full of tuna flavor, fresh with a heavy dusting of fine Panko bread crumbs. The spicy crab roll was even better, with bright, crisp cucumber, fresh seafood and perfect rice.   I've read reviews about the sushi not being fresh. I'd say they fixed that and recommend Bento Box for a fast, inexpensive, fresh lunch.

Tried Bento Box again but on a Monday lunch. The sign for 'more help' was down, so it looks like the policy is: one chef, one server.   This server struggled. She let me seat myself (not their policy) and then I waited about 7 mins for her to approach my table. She fell behind with other tables and might need more training but she wasn't horrible.   I ordered the Crunchy Spicy Tuna Roll, Spicy Crab Roll and an iced tea for under $12 plus tip.   The rolls were as good as last time: fresh, crispy and yummy. I still recommend Bento Box for a very good, sorta quick lunch. I was full and got out of there in 30 minutes.

Bento Box for lunch on Tuesday. Seven other customers here. I ordered the Spicy Pork Bulgolgi Bento Box.   My lunch arrived in six minutes, grilled, fried and crisp-tender. The SPB Bento Box had the pork Bulgolgi of course, plus four pieces of California roll, six pieces of tempura, seasoned rice and a salad.   I always like the salad with the sesame dressing. The rice is a good foil to the Bulgolgi and the tempura was excellent: light, crispy and fresh. The roll was good and fresh but the Bulgolgi stole the show. Marinated, grilled tender pork with a saucy treatment, with onions grilled in. They make it right, here.   Excellent meal, very good service and I highly recommend Bento Box for a fast, tasty meal.

First time at Da Valley Grill today. Arrived for lunch at noon and it was empty. Plenty of customers by the time we left tho.   We ordered a Chicken Katsu plate with potato salad and drink and I got a Bento Box (three item plate) with Chicken Katsu, Spam Musabi and Kailua Pork, along with cole slaw and a drink. Both plates came with rice.   The rice was good, if a bit dry. The slaw had a good flavor, was fresh and crunchy. Spam was also good but cut a bit thinner than I expected. The Katsu and the Pork were the highlight of the meal. The Katsu was crunchy but still light, juicy and flavorful. The accompanying sweet sauce was on the side, as I prefer. It was sweet, with hints of garlic, ginger and soy. The hoisin flavor was pronounced. The pork was very juicy with good smoke flavor.   I recommend the Bento Box, as well as Da Valley Grill for a fast, very tasty lunch.

Revisit today. Arrived at 11:40 on a Tuesday and two guys were dining. More came later.   I ordered a Bento Box with Chicken Katsu, Kailua Pork and Pineapple Chicken. I added a can of soda for $9.47 plus tip. The Bento comes with rice and a side, so I chose macaroni salad this time.   My lunch arrived in about 6 mins. The Kailua Pork was hot to the point of steamy. The Chickens were good, each with its own dipping sauce.   There was plenty of food to fill up this big guy and I still couldn't finish it.  The chicken was virtually the same for both dishes, just different sauces. The pineapple sauce was so cold and sweet, it went ignored.   Still the best Katsu around!

Had Fired Pie for the first time in Phoenix yesterday but it was so good, I had to try it again today in Chandler.   Arrived at 12:30 PM on a Tuesday and there were 25 in line with another 60 already eating. Wow. I made it to the front in 15 mins.   I ordered the same pie as yesterday: tomato sauce and pesto, mozzarella and fontina, pepperoni and spicy sausage, onions, jalapeños and garlic. All these toppings: $7.95. Could've had more but it was perfect.   Each pie is about 12" and thin crust. The crust comes out crisp but flexible enough to fold, if necessary. The toppings were perfectly cooked and the sauces/cheeses were just the right amount.   I can't think of anything else they could do to improve this except open more places so the line gets shorter. Close to my house in Phoenix would be appreciated!

Ate for the first time at Ha!banero today and enjoyed the fresh ingredients offered. The window to the kitchen showed the workers busily preparing more meats, veggies and such.   My wife ordered the burrito bowl for $6.50. It had rice, beans, shredded beef, veggies, salsas and all the usual sides like guacamole.   I ordered the tostada bowl with rice, beans, carne rojo (pork with spicy red chilies), cheese, habanero salsa and sour cream.  I got the special which included chips, salsa and a drink for $7.50.   Everything was very fresh, well thought out and delicious. The price for the burrito bowl seemed a touch high but all-in-all: a very good lunch.   Give Ha!banero a try. I think you'll like it as much or better than Chipotle.

Birthday dinner at Clever Koi. First time for four of our six. We had reservations for 7 on a Saturday night and the place was definitely hopping. It only seats 85 but I can't see fitting more than 60. It's tiny.   We were seated and then greeted right away. Menus were brought but, due to the crowded place, drinks weren't requested for another 10-15. We got a glass of wine, two beers, a Pellegrino and a coke. We also ordered the crudités and Peking Duck Croquettes at the same time, since it was a slow start.   The croquettes were excellent, with savory, crunchy exteriors and flavorful interior. The crudités were average. It had beets, fennel, carrots, snap peas, asparagus and radishes with a tzaziki sauce. The veggies were just too boring with no seasoning.   For entrées we ordered the Mushroom ramen (2),  Chow mien, Pork ramen, Thai beef and a Seafood Hot Pot (mine).  The ramen were well received by my table mates. I tasted the chow mien and the beef was tasty but the noodles were very bland, with no saucy flavors. My hot pot was okay. It had fish, scallops and shrimp. The fish was excellent and the shrimp, aside from being over cooked, was good. The scallops were 1/4" small so virtually no flavor there. The broth was hot but really had no body to it. Decent flavor but it missed the mark.   The vibe at Clever Koi is enough to bring me back. Our server, albeit a little slow, did his best. Try it and order the croquettes!

Another visit (with appt). Arrived at 7:30 for a 7:45 appt. there were 18 in line and the door opened promptly at 7:30.   Appointments were called first, then the line was processed within 12 mins.   Reception was very pleasant. Everyone spoke excellent English and they were all courteous, especially Tracy. I was taken to the back at 7:51.   The phlebotomist, Alicia, was efficient but left her personality at home.   Better, just a bad finish.

Another visit, great results. Arrived at 8:25 for an 8:45 AM appointment. The intake process was efficient and friendly.   I was taken back at precisely 8:45 by Tracy, who also drew my blood. I asked if she could take it from the back of my hand, which most phlebotomist shy from since they are smaller veins, smaller needles and a slower process but she didn't hesitate. It's my personal preference and a lot less painful.   Tracy was pleasant, aware of my nervousness and accommodating. Thanks!  I recommend this location!

Have to comment on a recent purchase. We bought an outdoor bar and a BBQ gazebo that match. We stuffed them in our vehicles. The warehouse worker plus the manager were very helpful during the whole process.   Unfortunately we were a bit high-maintenance since the pieces were so awkward to transport. Both gentlemen were patient, helpful and insightful into the products.   As it turns out, one piece of the bar was manufactured incorrectly: there were some mounting brackets missing from one of the larger side pieces that should've been welded on. We returned the piece to the Baseline/Laveen store and both guys were, again, very helpful, patient and insightful into our dilemma. The offered assistance multiple times and we both felt good after leaving that Big Lots was in capable hands.

First time at Top Golf. Won't be the last. We had a company function there and TG took care of everything.   We rented a suite which included seven golf bays. We had drinks, then went to the bays to hit some golf balls and have a buffet.   The buffet was a fairly deluxe salad, chicken skewers, salmon and roasted potatoes. The food was okay. I found the entrees the weaker portion and the salad/potatoes the better fare.   The golf was fun. You get up to six people per bay, hitting 20 balls each. They have eleven targets and each ball has a microchip so it senses when and where you hit one of the targets. It then assigns points, if you want to keep score.   I'll return with friends next time but without the food.

First time at US Foods Chef Store. OMG, I need to come back when I have more time and money.   I needed to get a couple of items for a soirée I was planning, so my chef-daughter recommended this place.   I walked in and it reminded me a bit of Costco: wide aisles, bulk buying, specialized items. They had everything you would need from a dinner party to opening a restaurant. I needed 100 fancy skewers for caprese kebabs and some 8" skewers for teriyaki beef. I also picked up some serving ware and seasoning as well and it came out to less than $12.   As I said earlier, what I could do with more time and money.

I've been to Midtown Endocrine a dozen times and have always had fantastic results. The online system is excellent, where you can see your appointment, medications, test results, etc.   The staff is caring, competent and trustworthy. Laura, up front, is efficient and pleasant. Dr. Edling and her PA Paige are top notch. I've been to three endocrinologists in the valley and now wished I'd been coming here all along.   I've recommended MEA to several people and they have all thanked me afterwards.   I highly recommend Midtown Endocrine Associates for their professionalism, caring attitude and efficient care.

So my company catered in NYPD today. They delivered pizzas, wings and salad.   The wings were good. Still hot, good amount of sauce and crispy skin. The pizza was good but had too much grease. They are large slices so the grease just pools up, making it unappetizing. Overall, the flavor was very good, with just the right seasonings, tasty sauce (could've used a bit more sauce tho) and good cheese. Again, very greasy tho. I'll try it again and see if ordering directly works out better.

First time at this Raising Cane's. Picked up 25 pieces, eight sauces for $30. Seems a little steep for chicken with no sides.   It was ready in 8 minutes.   The food was fine: breaded chicken strips, fried up and served in a box. Tough to screw up. Not much flavor, just fried chicken strips. The sauce is a variation of thousand island dressing but with more vinegar.   Cane's is good for feeding a crowd, just don't expect 11 herbs and spices.

First time at this Firehouse. I placed an online order (first time doing that) and the mobile site wasn't friendly at all, so I switched to desktop mode and it worked fine.   I ordered the Steamer - tough to go wrong with corned beef AND pastrami. Even tho I ordered all the regulars plus banana peppers, they ONLY put on the peppers, so it was very dry. Unfortunately I was at work and had no condiments. Not much parking around the place tho but they get a lot of walk-ins.   The bread was fresh, which is always dicey on take out, since it's too late to argue once you get back home/to work. But it was very good, toasted and soft.   The meat was good but, as I said, needed the requested mayo. All in all, Firehouse usually puts out good food. A bit lacking today.

First time at Angry Crab Shack tonight. Arrived at 7 on a Friday and waited 45 mins. They have a cool app that shows your place on the list so you won't miss your turn.   The six of us were seated and soon greeted by Alexia. She took excellent care of us all night. We ordered: 4 pounds of shrimp, two pound of mussels, two pounds of snow crab, a full rack of rib and a pound of catfish. We also got Gator bites and Cajun Fries plus a couple of red potatoes. After two rounds of drinks it came to $220 or about $37 per person plus tip. We had a lot of leftovers.   I had the Gator and Snow Crab. Since I ordered my crab with '#3 hot' sauce, Alexa recommended I get my gator in buffalo sauce. It was better that way. The crab was boiled in a bag (like all other non-BBQ dishes) and the seasoning was added in. Great flavor. The shrimps came unpeeled as well.   Messy but good. It was very loud in the ACS and there were a lot of celebrations going on, so we just shouted thru our meal.   Good, fun place to go but not on date-night: too messy and too loud.

First time at Cherry Tree BBQ. Arrived at 12:30 for lunch on a summer Saturday and there were three other tables full.   My wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich with two sides: fries and creamed corn. I ordered the pork rib combo with: 4 ribs and two sides which were corn bread and Mac N Cheese.   The counter service was exceptional. He was patient with us, explained the options, offered his opinions and made us feel comfortable. He also checked up on us twice after we got our meals.   Pulled pork Sammie: good but not great. Definitely needed sauce but it had good flavor. They were running 2/1 that day so we got an extra one. Nice. The fries and creamed corn were okay. I thought the corn was runny but my wife said she liked it.   My ribs were good: good smoke and chew, cooked nicely and sauced just right. They gave me 5 ribs, just cuz. The corn bread was eh. It had jalapeño which I like but needed something else. Maybe honey baked in?  The Mac was outstanding. Good creaminess, crispy topping and dark spots. Good stuff there.   The restaurant itself was decorated nicely with old-time decor but lacked AC, and it was 108 outside so it was suffocating. That was a big turn off.   I'll probably be back, due to location but I think I'll take it to go.

First time at Loaded Potato. I came here three times before but they were closed.  After talking with Dee, she said they are closed Sunday's and Monday's and open up a bit later on Saturday's, so that contributed to my problem. The neighborhood BTW, is horrible.   I arrived at 6 PM on a Wednesday and it was empty. Dee took care of me, tho, when she saw me wandering the lobby. It was a bit confusing until she got me straightened out. I ordered a large potato which is about 6" long. The jumbo is at least 8-9". The potatoes come with a lot of toppings, including one protein. I chose brisket and it came to $11.37.   Soulful Pandora music like Mary J Blige played on the TV while I waited. It took about 10 minutes to build my dinner.   The potato was fluffy and cooked just right. The brisket very flavorful as were the rest of the toppings. I really couldn't improve on it if I tried, so I'll come back.

First time at Tav. Met a few guys for a bite and brews. Arrived at 5:30 PM on a Friday and it was 1/2 full.   Tina greeted me after a while. The beer selection was very limited, unless she just didn't want to cover them all. There were standard pool tables, some video games and a few TV's around the place. Pretty dive-ey really but I didn't pick the place.   I ordered a beer (on happy hour) and wings (no happy hour between 5-8 PM). Weird. The wings were not breaded, yay. They were not very tasty though, boo. They weren't really crisp and were way too over sauced, creating a quagmire in my tray. You can't replace good flavor with a lot of sauce.   Tina had a bit of trouble keeping up with the orders and we had to seek her out twice just to get service, despite the owner coming to our table and chatting with us for quite a while.   Not recommended at this time.

First time at Tom Yum.  Arrived at 1 PM on a Sunday and the place was empty. All of downtown was empty for Labor Day weekend.   The menus here are put together more like a cheap, fast food place rather than finer dining. It wasn't visually friendly and took us a while to navigate.   Our daughter got Yellow Curry with Tofu. She's not vegetarian but likes tofu. My wife got Beef Pad Thai while I ordered Royal Shrimp Supreme.   The shrimp was kinda weird. It came in a rich tamarind sauce but aside from some steamed broccoli and carrots, it was just shrimp. The Pad Thai was also in a strange sauce. Not horrible but not great.   The whole bill (water for drinks) came to $42 plus tip. Too high for the meal. Probably won't go back since there are so many good Thai restaurants nearby.

Been to this Five Guys three times now and have not been disappointed. I've been to a few others around the valley with mostly positive results.   Today I ordered a single bacon cheeseburger with various toppings and a lettuce burger with limited toppings, plus fries on the side.  The burgers are cooked fresh to order and are about 1/4 pound. The bread for the buns is always fresh, as are the crisp toppings. They offer a good assortment of condiments, such as A1, ketchup, hot sauce and such, along with the usual suspects like lettuce, onions and pickles.   The fries are always plentiful here, as you get a double order each time. They fill the container and then give you that much more in the bag. You have to get a go-box to take it home or you get grease on your car seat. The seasonings are always on point tho. Plus they offer malt vinegar.

Tried Cafe Rio today. It opened near work a couple of months ago and they haven't seemed to draw much business yet but I gave it a try.   I ordered a Spicy Pork Barbacoa Burrito (see pic).  Not very exciting and if that was the spicy version, the mild must be really boring.   They will need to step up their game to draw a crowd or they will go under. Perhaps a better menu on the website, more creative dishes and any level of enthusiasm in their crew, some creative sides, IDK.

First time at Gentle Dental. I called on a Thursday morning for an emergency appointment and the earliest available was Monday morning. Hmm, not much of an emergency?  I came here because I went across the street yesterday and they want me to spend $5000 to fix one tooth. Yes, one tooth. Uh, how about NO?  So I came here. I'll update after my appointment.   Made it in for my appt. GD was very apologetic that they couldn't get me in until today. I appreciated that they brought it up before I did. I had 18 X-rays done. The doc saw me thereafter and confirmed the same work was needed but for $900. To help with my pain they sent me to endodontist in Scottsdale in their group right away. Mariah and the rest of the team was helpful, professional and efficient.   I recommend Gentle Dental for efficiency, affordability and courtesy.

First time at this Fili B's. My first impression: the place is clean, organized and well laid out. They have a good salsa selection but sans Carrots and Peppers. Sad day. The menu board looks very good. Definitely an upgrade from most Fili B's.   I ordered five orders for take out. I had to make several changes due to various allergies and all orders were done right.   I got the Adobado Plate, which consists of marinated pork, pico de gayo, lettuce, beans and rice. It was scrumptious. It's easy to over cook since it's such a small dice but mine was rich and flavorful.   I'll be back.

First time at Hopdaddy.  Definitely not my last. In fact, as I write this review five days after my visit, I lobbied with my family for a return but they were craving something else.   We arrived at noon on a Sunday and it was 2/3 full. Good sign. We came here on a recommendation from a chef, so we had high expectations. We were not disappointed.   You approach the counter and place your order and then you are assigned a table. They have a seasonal menu so I got the Llana Poblano Burger, with pepper jack and big pieces of roasted poblano on a freshly baked bun. My son got the Buffalo Bill with bison, bacon, Bleu Cheese and hot sauces, which was my second choice. We each ordered fries too.   Our beers (huge) arrived in short order and Meagan took good care of us. Our lunch arrived 8 mins later. What excellent burgers!  Rich flavor, good balance of sauce-to-veggie-to-meat ratio. The fresh bun. Yum. The fries were cooked with spices that took them over the top.   I can't wait for a return visit.

Fired Pie just opened this week on Baseline and 24th St. Been to several other FP with great results. Service was slow but they're still learning how to make them.   My pie was excellent as always. It's unlimited toppings for $7.95, so definitely a cheap date.   I recommend Fired Pie, once they get their legs under them. Trust me, it will happen cuz they're good pizzas. Build it and they will come.

First time at this Firehouse Subs. Been to several others throughout the valley over the years. This one is a new place.   I arrived at 11 on a weekday and there were four tables filled and two more in line. I ordered my usual: The Steamer. It has steamed corned beef brisket and pastrami on a soft roll with provolone, mayo, mustard and Italian dressing. It comes in medium and large.   Usually adding chips and a drink brings it to $11-12 for a large lunch. Some of the proceeds go to the firefighters fund plus they sell pickle buckets for $2 for the same. They also ask you to 'round off' your tab to the nearest dollar to help the fund, which I always do.   I recommend Firehouse Subs for a tasty, hot sub sandwich that makes you feel good inside for multiple reasons.
