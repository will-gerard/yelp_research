The decor and music gave me high hopes but I will not go back to this restaurant. My friend and I sat at the bar since we only had an hour before our movie. Ordered an app plate of olives and a margherita pizza to share. The service was terrrible. After 20 minutes of no atttention by the bartender I asked her about the olives. The reply..."I ordered them." She then made no attempt to check on our order. Half hour to get a small bowl of olives! And the pizza. It never arrived. We finally gave up after an hour, left money on the bar for our olives and left. The bartender seemed confused that we would leave. Really? She never said a word to us or checked on our order. About the worst service I even had. A place can never be cool enough to excuse bad service.

I went to Pastis for dinner tonight and wasn't disappointed. Being a vegetarian I am never sure what choices I will have when I go someplace new. This menu had quite a few choices. I ordered the portabello burger, which came with homemade fries. Normally I don't eat fries but these were so good I easily ate half the serving. The burger was also very good and very filling.  My waitress was friendly and attentive. My water glass was never more than half empty. And she was very accommodating when I asked if I could replace the mayo-type sauce with hummus.  I highly recommend Pastis for dinner. I want to try going for lunch next time. They have some lunchtime-only sandwiches that sounded delicious.  I also want to mention that the music was excellent - courtesy of Putumayo. It complimented the restaurant's casual European ambiance.

Just returned from a wonderful lunch. As a vegetarian I love when a place has so many yummy-sounding options for me to choose from. But there are also plenty of meat dishes as well. And they also list those items gluten-free.  Thanks to the not-so-wonderful xmas shopping traffic around the Scottsdale mall, one in my party was a bit late. It was disappointing that the server wasn't more attentive in getting her order, considering he delivered our meals after she was there and had a chance to review the menu. We had to ask another server to take her order.  Despite the slight lapse in service I highly recommend this restaurant. The food is great. I will go back again soon.
