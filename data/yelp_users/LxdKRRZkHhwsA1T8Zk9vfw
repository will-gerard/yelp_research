been coming here 2 or 3 times a week since December and I've lost 35 pounds :) this is far more than just a gym, all the trainers are amazing and knowledgeable, and all the members are great and encouraging and I'm glad to be part of the family! I would highly suggest anyone, whether you're a beginner or very athletic, see what all the hype is about! because it's worth it :) so thankful for this place and I'll be working out here forever

the past few times I've come here I've gotten my acrylic fill and gel polish done by (I believe her name was) Jackie? she does a really thorough job with making sure the nails are really smooth and I've always been happy with her work. noticed she has people request her frequently! :) thanks new world nails!   they also have a good rewards program that saved me some money today :)

delicious food here, at unbeatable prices! normally I'll only go to a sushi joint for happy hour, but the prices are still very reasonable during normal hours :)  making my boyfriend take me here for all our sushi dates!

used to really like this place cause the sushi is always good or decent, but the past couple times we've been the service has been terrible. and the last time we payed, we put $20 cash down and told her to put the remaining balance on the card. this chick clearly took the 20 for herself and put the whole total on the card because that's what showed on our bank statement later. will not be returning, there's better sushi around.

there is always something wrong with my nails when I come here.  DO NOT come here especially if you want designs. they can't do it and if they try they'll make your nails ugly. I got charged for a hideous design that I had to come take off the next day, and they weren't considerate enough to offer me $ back for the design or $ off my next service. only good nail tech here is Kim. probably won't come back unless she's available  also, I just got my nails done here on Wednesday and it's only Saturday and the gel is already chipping on 7 of my nails...

came here for their happy hour tonight and was really impressed with the rolls here :) really good sized and perfectly made !   the sushi chef personally came over to our table and took our orders, he was really nice and helped us with suggestions. he also checked on us to make sure we liked the rolls :) I'll be coming back for sure

sushi bros is the best, wish it was closer to me but it's worth the 15 minute drive! sashimi here is the freshest I've found in AZ :)

just had an amazing experience here, the nail salon is under new ownership (a really sweet couple that just moved to AZ) and I had Michelle do my pedicure and SNS manicure , she was so nice and did a phenomenal job :) glad she suggested the SNS opposed to gel! it's better!! I usually hop around to different nail salons depending on where im at but this is my new permanent nail salon! she also told me they're going to do a beautiful renovation on the place starting tonight thru tomorrow, and will be offering complimentary wine and sangria sooooo, hell yeah who doesn't want that?! thanks Nail'ish! will be back forsure!
