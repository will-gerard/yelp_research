I really enjoyed staying here the last time but this time did not turn out to be all that great. First off I came back to my hotel to my door propped open thinking that housekeeping was still cleaning inside. Come to fine out, there was no one in there. I then ask the front desk what time the house keepers are gone for the day. They said that they leave at 3pm...This was almost 6pm. So my room was WIDE OPEN open for 3 hours. All I got from the manager was "I'm sorry".   After that all I wanted was some toothpaste since I left forgot mines at home. So the manager handed me sample size envelope worth of toothpaste... (Mind you, I will be staying here for 3 nights). I asked for a sample tube instead since I am here for more then 1 night. They said that I can go buy some in their little store...Wow such good service you got going here Homewood. Good job! I am sure that I WILL NOT be staying here again.

This maybe the best eye care services I have ever gotten. Run by Brian and Angela (Dr. Marquez) in a very modern clinic. Before the exam, Brian went over all the options I had as in pricing and options. Angela does all the exams and is very very through when you have any questions at all. Even helped me pick out my classes (within the price range and within my style). Ended up with a pair of transition lens, cool frame, and eye exam with dilation all under $150! Highly highly recommend this place!

I would also like to give this property 0 stars. AWFUL  customer service. When I first moved in here the original management was awesome! But now I know everyone else. However the only one that stayed was the assistant manager. He is just an horrible person, Very mean and not friendly at all. The maintenance took a good 3 weeks...I requested multiple times to have my bill from moving out to be mail to me but instead, I got a collection letter. When I reported this to Orian (The main company) no one cared. So DO NOT LIVE HERE!
