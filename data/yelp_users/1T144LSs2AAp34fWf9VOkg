I just am in love with this store! Associates are awesome and their sportswear is the best there is out there! I always love to pick thru their great markdowns, because it Is somewhat pricey.although you do get what you pay for....and quality lasts!

I agree with jj b.... These guys are like hawks just waiting to come up and swoop up their prey.  I made the mistake of going here without my dad it at least a male figure to help me out and whatdya know? The pretty much screwed me. I have had nothing but problems with these guys    and I can't even begin to tell you the crap we are going through right now as our transmission has gone kaput. The service techs try as they can to be nice and friendly, which they are, but still money hungry! I really wish I could say I was happy with this place cuz I doo love mazda vehicles...but honestly I would get out as fast as I could!
