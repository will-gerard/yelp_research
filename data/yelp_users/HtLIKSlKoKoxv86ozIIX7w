We stayed here while on business. I wish we had booked somewhere else. The staff here is incredibly rude, lazy and completely incapable of caring about customer service.

This place rocks! I went in this morning to get a new head unit for my car, I already had something in mind but they didn't carry it. This was fine because they found me something that did exactly what I wanted and actually saved me some money. And who doesn't love saving money?  They started on my car right away, had it done in no time and installed beautifully. They even mounted the Bluetooth mic in a great spot and didn't leave any visible wires.  I will definitely be back here to get everything else done. Low pressure sales that focuses on getting you what's right for you and not what makes them the most money. Combine that with quick expert installers and great prices and this is by far the BEST place in the valley to get your audio hookup

Once again I found myself back at Sun Valley Stereo.  This time with a new car that was all promises and no function for what I needed.  Not only do they consistently provide great customer service, they never try and oversell you on something you don't need.  My car is playing tunes the way I wanted it to when I bought it, and I couldn't be happier with them or their level of service.  Rock on!

I had the Bourbon burger with sweet potato tots and it was amazing!!!  I wish I lived locally so I could eat here all the time.

Man this place is something else.  The food is tasty, the place is a totally wonderful dive, and the staff are fantastic.  I just wish the protein portions were larger and the rice and beans a little smaller.  They're all fantastic.  I got the Jade Chicken and Machaca in a quesadilla with black beans and jerk fried rice.  I think next time I'll try the emerald chicken in a quesdilla.

I came in here after looking at a number of Valley shops to purchase a new S&W M&P 15-22 for myself and my daughter to take to the range.  The price I paid was almost exactly the same as I could find online, and without shipping I saved a bundle.    The staff here are knowledgeable, patient and don't have that attitude you find so commonly at most gun shops.  It's a pleasure patronizing an establishment such as this and it's now my go-to shop in Phoenix for all my firearms needs.

Found this place by accident the other day and glad I did! Amazing selection of delicious liquids and gear for vaping. Gotta try the house blends too, Erin's OG  Explosion is my favorite all day vape

We worked with George Butter. He was incredibly thorough, professional, pleasant, and explained everything in great detail. Not only was he incredible to work with, but all of our documents were emailed to us before we even got home.  We ended up withdrawing on the contract due to issues that came up, and the first person I called for a home inspection was Affordable Inspections when we found a new house.  I will recommend them to everyone who needs an inspection every time. And ask for George! He's a huge asset to that company and really made the process simple and comfortable for us.

This place is amazing! I've been accused of being a fanboy for Butt Out but Matt has always gone out of his way to earn every bit of appreciation and Mill is no different! The style, vibe,  and character of this shop are top notch and I have been in hundreds of shops across the nation. Not only is the customer service the best but so is the juice. 2 enthusiastic thumbs up for another spectacular iteration of Butt Out.
