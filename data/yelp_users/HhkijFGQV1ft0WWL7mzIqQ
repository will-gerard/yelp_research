Lux is my Sunday morning tradition. It's timeless. I've been going to Lux for years, and it's always been consistent. The service, food, drinks - all of it.   They play great music too.   Try the strawberry cornbread pastry, you'll be glad you did. Or the lemon cake!

I really liked this place.  The bartender was real chill, the patrons were damn friendly, and the drinks were made with what seemed to be a hint of love. haha  Juke box, as everyone else mentions, was a great. Lots of good stuff there.

I've been here for a cleaning and a whitening and both experiences were great. Everyone makes you feel really welcome and they are extremely helpful. I absolutely recommend this place to family, friends and anyone reading this review!

You need to eat here, you have to. La piazza is absolutely incredible. Their pizzas, appetizers, desserts - all of it.   I've been to plenty of Italian restaurants around Phoenix, and until I had La Piazza, The Parlor was my favorite. The next part may sound ridiculous to you, but the moment I bit into a slice of the Diabolo, I was hooked.  Seriously, I couldn't believe how good it was! I couldn't believe I could be surprised by pizza, an item I've had millions of times, but not like this one.  The dough, incredible. It tastes fresh, like my grandmother hand rolled it in the back there. The sauce, amazing. You could taste each ingredient in it and it was as fresh as picking a tomato and taking a bite right out of it.  I don't know what else to say, other than the food is phenomenal. I recommend this place to EVERYONE. My friends are probably getting tired of me talking about it lol but it's something you have to experience. Do it.

So tonight was my first time at Cornish Pasty Co. And I have to say, I was not impressed. Walking in, the smell of flaky crust and fresh baked Pasty's entices you, but for me - the flavor fell flat.  I ordered the Asiago Chicken Pasty. The inside was lined with hablano pepper, chicken, black beans and cheese. I'm not sure what type of seasoning was used, but no flavor really stuck out. Almost Like the chicken and pepper were boiled in a pot and thrown in. The spice of the pepper was not too powerful, but it was the most prominent flavor - or sensation I guess.  The crust was done well, but it wasn't as flaky as I personally would've liked. I don't know if I would try this place again. The waitress didn't really seem to want to be there - which is fine, but At least try and hide it lol

Songbird is a nice place free from the large crowds most other local coffee shops attract.  I had a chocolate "pop tart", mmmmm! The coffee was smooth and not too bitter or sweet, It's a great blend. Next time you're in the area, check it out.. And try the spicy chai, if you're into that sorta thing

I don't quite know what to make of this place. I really wanted to love it. The concept is cool and the design seems cool until you walk inside. Natural light fills the massive two story room from the Windows surrounding.   It feels sort of like a mall cafeteria, but more upscale. It feels empty, honestly. The weird thing is - it's not. I decided to try the food at the Japanese restaurant (the name I didn't bother remembering) on the first floor. The food at that particular restaurant was horrible. The rice was over cooked and had absolutely no flavor. The only thing I could finish was the salad. That was good. It was a side salad   Maybe someday I'll muster up the courage to try another restaurant in Desoto Market, but not likely any time soon.

I'm rarely in the mood for a burger these days, especially since they all seem the same. I mean, how creative can a burger get anymore?  I didn't try any of their specialty burgers - I decided to build my own. I know that's not new or anything, but when you have things like sun dried tomatoes, pesto, grated Parmesan.. You can make one helluva burger.  The service was great, the beef was cooked extremely well and the view of the city and light rail made for very interesting people watching through their large double pane Windows.  Only downside imo is location. Parking is a bit tough, but don't let that deter you. Check it out and tell them Chris sent you.  Ok, don't tell them that. They probably have no idea who I am.
