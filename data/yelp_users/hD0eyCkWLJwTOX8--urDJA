went here using a living social deal. room was much bigger than we expected with a cute little living room area. two tvs, nice big bed, very clean. there was a bottle of wine in our room upon arrival. the front desk was very helpful. from 530-730 there were free drinks at the clubhouse, and we definitely took advantage, but it seemed not many others did. upstairs from the clubhouse is a sports grille, where we ate dinner. food was great, especially for a sports bar. there are two pools and hot tubs, but it was too cold when we went to dip in, although we saw some people in the pool. would definitely go again. 4 stars only because the elevators smelled weird.

My only complaint: You can't make a reservation, so it can take a while to get seated especially with a larger party. My favorite pizza is the avocado prosciutto, it's just the right combination of salty and creamy. The pizza dough consistency is great too.  They have some great salads too. The best (in my opinion) is the one with kale and quinoa (can't remember what it's called). So good. They have complimentary valet parking, so remember to bring a couple dollars in cash to tip them. They also have parking in front, but it's usually packed.

1. They have an awesome happy hour, with their best menu items. 3-6pm, I believe. 2. Service has always been good, every time I have been there.  3. You get free dessert on your birthday. 4. Most importantly, the food is delicious. I have yet to get something I am disappointed in there. Flatbreads, amazing. Forbidden rice, delicious. French onion burger, omg. It goes on and on. They also change up the menu depending on the seasons, which can be a bit of a bummer if your favorite flatbread goes missing, but they always are adding new amazing dishes.  One of my favorite places to eat in the Valley.

Best vet I have found (for cats, can't speak for any other type of animal as I don't have any).  The vets are fantastic, knowledgeable, great with the cats. The office is clean, and doesn't smell of wet animal (which vets office often do). The staff are all very helpful and kind. And it is incredibly easy to make an appointment, either online or over the phone.   If you live in the area and need a vet, I would definitely recommend that you check them out.

I have a dog now, and can verify for anyone wondering that they are just as great with dogs as they are with cats.   My dog absolutely loves going to the vet (I know, super weird) and runs up to greet everyone there because they are all just so friendly and kind to him. They always make sure that he is comfortable during every procedure, and help me to make decisions that make sense from a health standpoint as well as a financial standpoint.  Absolutely recommend.

These guys were amazing. The trucker that brought my shipping container to my storage unit was 5 hours late, and the guys had already come to the storage unit to move my stuff once, and had to turn around and go back.   Ryan called me and kept up to date on the whole day, and made sure I would still have movers to help me hours later. They even sent an extra guy free of charge to help me out.   I was dealing with my mom's stuff, and she is recently deceased, while also carrying around my 4 month old baby, so it was definitely an amazing relief to have such amazing helpful guys come out and move everything so quickly, efficiently, and carefully.   I will definitely be calling them again the next time I need movers.

The food here is awesome. I really like the bruscetta and the prosciutto/fig sandwich. The raspberry salad is also delicious.  Drinks are a bit pricey unless you come during the happy hour. The happy hour is $5 for a glass of wine.   There is an outdoor seating area as well as inside the restaurant. The music can be really loud inside during dinner, but it wasn't bad during lunch.

Artie is a very professional, very skilled plumber. He came by because my toilet is clogged, and I couldn't snake anything out myself. He tried snaking through the toilet, and let me know that there was some obstruction that wasn't letting his snake go where the water should be flowing, and was making the snake go up the wall through the vent. So he climbed up on my roof and snaked down the vent and found that he was able to unclog some things from there. He tested the toilet to make sure it flushed (it did!) and then started flushing down pieces of toilet paper to make sure (I definitely wouldn't have thought of that, and no plumbers I have worked with ever made sure in that way). This is how he found out that even a piece of toilet paper re-clogged the toilet. He said this was because of the obstruction from earlier, directed me to the Locator (video plumbing service) to see what was going on inside the pipe, and told me that it was probably due to an L where a Y should be, and that he could fix it right there, but wanted to save me the money in case it wasn't (it wasn't). The Locator came by and found out it was a piece of PVC pipe inside the pipe, so now we just need to figure that out.   In summary, Artie: was on time was polite did his job referred me to the right people when he was not able to give me a 100% answer / solution is my new go-to plumber

I had an emergency leak in a pipe outside when it got cold last month, and called Artie. He was really busy because everyone was having this issue, but came by as quickly as he could (less than an hour) and fixed it up really quickly. He also showed me how to turn off the water so that I don't get a really high water bill if something like that ever happens again.  Again, he is incredibly polite, efficient, and  had a great price especially for an emergency. I definitely recommend him.

Small hole in the wall place that I wouldn't have noticed, but my old apartment manager told me about it. The carne asada here is amazing, and I don't even like carne asada. Tacos are incredibly cheap, so I haven't tried anything else yet. The service isn't bad, and it's a lot cleaner on the inside than you'd expect.

One of the worst apartment complexes I have ever lived in. The staff are unfriendly and unhelpful. Our bathtub, dishwasher, and refrigerator all leak, and we have yet to have someone come in to fix it. I doubt management even put in a request after I came in about it. The carpet was stained when we got here, and I have worked hard trying to clean it to no avail. They should have made this place perfect before we moved in with how high the prices are. Cannot wait to move out.

my toenails are gross, and the guy that did my pedicure only flinched a little bit. and he made them shiny and pretty. julie did my eyebrows, and now i no longer look like some sort of hair beast. i will be going back next week for a manicure, as i didn't have time last time. definitely go here.

It's close to my work, so anytime I want ice cream, I go here (even though Coldstone is closer). They have awesome flavors. My favorites are the coffee coco loco and there is a special cookie dough one...Awesome. The people that work there are really nice, and if you have a million questions about what kind of cinnamon they use in their cookies, they won't get mad and they'll actually answer. The only downside is the tiny parking lot for Nami+Green, but you can usually make do.

I dropped my iphone and shattered the front screen, and wanted to get my boyfriend's ipod touch checked out (it was thoroughly ruined at another "repair" company).   My iphone was fixed in less than 15 minutes, and works great now.

Completely ridiculous.  My boyfriend got a livingsocial deal to use here after his ipod touch front screen cracked. I took it in and was told it would take 2 hours to complete the job. This was the first sign that something was wrong, because it should only take 15-20 min tops to replace the front screen. After two hours, I come back in and the guy is just chatting away on his phone to a friend, and doesn't acknowledge me. When he finally does, he tells me the ipod doesn't charge correctly, and that he can't fix that. This is strange because the ipod was charging fine at the house, and outside of the cracked screen, everything was working perfectly. On top of that, he didn't put the screen on correctly and it no longer sits flush on the ipod.  I took the ipod to get repaired at another location and the guy working there showed me how there was shattered glass and what seemed to be rubber cement or some other adhesive all over the inside, absolutely disgusting. There was no care put into this job at all. The charger was not something that could be fixed, he said he didn't even understand how someone who works with iphones and ipods could mess up so badly.

Awesome.  Try the buddy system, one on one, or a class to start with. Chris will make sure that you are working at the level that you can finish with, which is more than you think it is. You will be exhausted.  Not only am I getting way more fit, I am also learning how to box and defend myself, which is great. I feel stronger and more confident.   Everyone that I've met there has been really friendly. There are some kids training, women training, lots of men training. Pretty much all sorts of people. Don't be intimidated.

Food is edible but mediocre. Got the wings, which had little meat on them, we're not crispy at all, and were smothered in a weirdly gelatinous sauce (honey hot). The pizza was alright, nothing special but not bad. The breadsticks with cheese were also okay.   We ordered delivery, which was to come "within an hour", but didn't arrive for nearly an hour and a half. When I called to get the status, there was no apology for delay, just "he's on his way so..." When delivery did arrive, again, no apology for being late. Service could definitely be improved.

George was timely, thorough, and went over everything in detail so that I don't feel worried about things going wrong later. It was a great experience working with him, and I would definitely recommend him if you want a professional and friendly inspector.
