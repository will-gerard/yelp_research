Postinos is a true treasure in the city's somewhat lackluster scene for good, unique eating experiences. The lack of reservation and self-parking ability (try valet!) fails to put a damper on the the restaurants selective wine list, fresh food, and escapist ambiance. Be sure to go on Monday night for a  perfectly orchestrated collaboration with neighboring LGO owned pizzeria - You can't go wrong with the corn and goat cheese pizza...

Cupcakes - a dessert I've never fully understood, but appreciated nonetheless. This perhaps has something do with the fact that I can cut a slice of cake as big as I want and still count it as just one piece. With cupcakes, however, I find myself satisfying my stubborn sweet tooth with three or four of the tasty little treats.  After listening to all the hype regarding these particular cupcakes (second to the blonde bombshell owners), I let go of my reservations and purchased a half-dozen, mile-high frosted cupcakes. At first bite, I was disappointed. The frosting, although rather abundant, was superb, while the cake was dry and bland. Each subsequent cupcake taste test yielded similar results. All in all, the cupcakes (and employees) are nice to look at it, but fail to encourage me to come back for more.
