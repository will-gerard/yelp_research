I absolutely LOVE this Walgreens. Staff is super friendly here! I live about 20 miles away from this location but when I go visit my family (which live about a mile away from here) I always visit here to grab the things I need.

I came in earlier today to get some items on sale. The cashier (Lisa) was very very rude not only to me but my whole family which was with me also buying some items. Never coming back to this location.

Horrible customer service tonight at the "fine" jewelry department. I wanted some links taken out of my $300 Michael kors watch I bought from there but because I didn't have my receipt the old man turned me away. I will be returning with my receipt to return this watch. Never coming here again.

So if my experience wasn't bad before I went back with my receipt and the lady that helped us out at the fine jewelry was very nice, but when the manager came out she was the biggest bitch. She didn't show any concern for my horrible experience or the time wasted. Just said its policy shrugged her shoulders and walked away. Didn't say have a nice day or asked if there was anything else she could be assistance of. This managers name is Lynn. The gm of this location whose name is Chris will be getting a call as well. She needs to be aware of the poor customer service her employees are giving. Almost like I'm wasting their time after I have spent nearly 500$ there. I returned everything and went to Dillard's to buy the same exact items for the same price.

Love it here! Very nice people and service is quick! Perfect for mornings when I'm cutting it close to get to work.

Went here with my dad today, we were very pleased with Sebastian and Eric they were super helpful same with the manager on duty. Didn't catch her name but super friendly staff.

I went to the front counter in the poker room yesterday just to ask a question. I was not acknowledged, half of them didn't even look at me (there were 5 people there) one guy looked at me and just continued with his conversation he was having with another coworker. The other three were goofing off. After standing there for a few minutes I turned around and walked away. I am super upset because my question was simple, it was also Mother's Day and I spent a few hundred there so I would assume customer service should be a priority to them. It wasn't a short drive to this casino either so no one in my family will be returning here. I would rather go to casino Arizona.
