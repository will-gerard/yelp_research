Back before the statewide smoking ban, George & Dragon used to really get me goolies in a twist. I mean, here's a place where I can watch soccer, get a good plate of fish & chips and choose from many good brews.   But I could't go there because I'm a normal air-breathing human. But now, it's 2007 and the smokers have been banished to the outdoors. Gooooooaaaaaaaaallllll! That means I can hang out at the George and watch quality soccer since I'm too cheap to spring for Gol TV at home. Plus I don't have a bartender firing off hysterical commentary at home.   The shepherd's pie isn't bad, either. But if you're in the mood for a Cornish pasty, go to The Cornish Pasty Company in Tempe. They don't play the soccer games, but you stand a good chance of hearing some Iron Maiden blaring over the speakers!  Back to the George, I think we've covered it all. Now just wait 'til that blasted construction is finished...

So a coffee fiend (me) walks into Zoom Espresso. He asks for a hot cafe americano (which is on the menu, by the way).  The young dude behind the cash register gives him a blank stare and asks "What's in a cafe americano?"  "Two shots of espresso and water," says the coffee fiend.  "Nobody's ever ordered one of those here before."  "Umm, just gimme a large cup of regular coffee."  And even that wasn't good. If a place has the word "espresso" in the name, it's necessary to have someone who can pull at least a competent shot of espresso. And knows what an americano is.

At Sonora Brewhouse, a German guy named Uwe makes the beer. The staff, though, makes the brewhouse.  Since it's a brewhouse, let's start with the beer. Sonora has a brew for nearly everybody. If you like it dark and heavy, there's usually a mix of stout, porter or barley wine. For the lighter folks, there's a very competent mix of hefeweizens and pale ales. For big beer flavors, there's usually an IPA. The best stuff, though, comes out of the cask. Cask-conditioned ales have an awesome flavor that allows the character of the hops to shine out. My main quibble with Sonora's cask selections is that they're too often of the pale variety. I'd love to see a stout or porter in the cask at least once a month. I would celebrate to see a Belgian trippel wind up on the menu, too.  Sonora also serves food. The cottage pie is tasty, as are the fish 'n' chips and homemade soups, and the nachos are a nice snack. The burgers, both the pub and Kobe varieties, depend greatly on how the person at the grill defines rare, medium and done well. Unfortunately, their definitions are often differerent from mine.  This brewpub also has a great atmosphere. Sit at the bar and chat with the other brew lovers. It's a friendly place, and you'll have fun conversations. They staff actually know their beers and have strong opinions. And they're just as friendly as the drinkers. And you can actually talk to them without shouting over music that's way too loud (hear that, Four Peaks?!).

It would take a lot of mojitos and sangria to get me back to Havana Cafe anytime soon. Is the food bad? No. But Cuban food is a bit bland on my taste buds next to other foreign cuisines The San Juan Platter I had was kind of plain, and only a garlic sauce gave some of the items any taste at all. The pollo cubano was pretty much chicken soaked in lime juice and buried in sauteed onions.   But those mojitos and sangria are definitely tasty, and the waiting staff is excellent. It seemed, though, a woman I guess was the owner thought a Saturday night would be a great time to conduct a rather loud discussion about marketing and operations for Havana Cafe. That sliced into the already dull atmosphere.   Another complaint: Why does Havana Cafe feel the need to take up its entire front parking lot with valet parking? I'm neither too lazy to walk, not do I enjoy having strangers drive my vehicle. For a parking lot so small in a climate so mild, valet parking is just stupid.   Really, if I want a fairly fancy Latin-flavored meal, I'll just head over to Asi es la Vida or Mucho Gusto Taqueria. Both restaurants are a lot more inventive, interesting and memorable.

Oh, Matt...you're killing me. You did so well with Matt's Big Breakfast. And now...this.  First, your staff kept me waiting for a good 15 minutes before taking my order. The second offense was worse: My server plopped a freezing-cold stout on the table. WRONG! FAIL! Save the frigid temperatures for mass-produced domestic lagers poured directly from a horse's bladder. Serve a stout just slightly chilled.   Yeah, the pretzel was good. But I really came here for a good beverage. If you enjoy swathing yourself in hipness, this is a fine establishment. For me, it's a bit too unfriendly and too callow in its beer selection.

First things first: Don't pronounce "pasty" to rhyme with those things strippers use to cover their nipples (um, or so I've heard...). It's pronounced "pass-tee."   Pasties are a traditional lunch food for miners from Cornwall in the UK. They go back hundreds of years, and you can read the menu to learn all about that. Dean, the founder, head chef and all-around professor of pasties, will be happy to add even more, being the good Cornish lad he is.   Now, there are a bunch of things I like about CoPaCo. First, the pasties range from the traditional to the totally off-the-wall. The recipes are so varied, from the Royal with Cheese to the Lamb Vindaloo and the Lovely Bit of Salmon, that I can't even pick a favorite. If I go there 10 different times, I'll eat ten different pasties. They're hand-made each day, including the dough. The kitchen crew at this place proves humans built the pyramids - these guys work their tales off keeping the pasties coming, and they make Amish barn raisers look lazy.  Second, it's just a fun place. There's usually good, hard rock 'n' roll playing over the sound system. It's a place where you can have some ribald antics and loud laughter and nobody cares. It's laid-back and unpretentious. The staff is courteous, though they can get a bit harried during the busy hours. But they'll always try their hardest and be friendly.  Third, there are some great desserts. The bonofee pie (graham cracker crust, whipped cream, bananas, caramel!) is my favorite.  What could be better? Eh, I'd ditch the taps that disgorge Kronenburg 1664 and Hoegaarden and drop in a fewer higher-octane brews. In the meantime, the cooler is full of bottled selections. The Skull Splitter is awesome!  Keep in mind that even though I gave it five stars, this is not a fancy, high-falutin' sort of place. It's absolutely perfect for what it is: a fun place to gather with your hooligan sidekicks, eat creative twists on the Cornish pasty and listen to some rock music. Brilliant!

There's only so much grease and cheese and sodium and meat derived from rat ass that I can handle. Once in awhile, I need  a workday lunch that doesn't feel like I pulled the pin of a grenade and swallowed it.   Rumbi Island Grill gives me some veggies that weren't boiled into oblivion, a bit of chicken and some spicy sauces. My usual choice there is a small jerk chicken bowl with Rumbi rice. I sprinkle this with generous squirt of The Hot Cock (aka Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce).   The chicken tastes real. And there's nothing wrong with some rice and beans. Plus I don't wind up feeling like that guy from "Supersize Me." Or worse yet, Jerrod!  I still wouldn't mind a moratorium on steel drum music, though...

I'll be honest: I've only been here twice. But both times, the baristas have been friendly and intelligent...and they properly pull an espresso shot and make a mean iced toddy (sometimes, the temperatures are too high here for a hot americano...).   Most important for me, they have awesome beans to take home and feed to my grinder and french press - try the Brazilian Blue and the Mexican Chiapas.

Alright, you know from David B. what sort of offerings you'll find at Conspire. I'm just going to focus on two things: coffee and buttons.  John, who is the man behind the coffee, is the master of the espresso machine. He pumps out a cafe americano that is silky smooth and just the right temperature. It frankly punches the lights out of any other cafe americano. If ya feel like a latte or mocha, fear not - he's not going to make it sickly sweet. You'll still be able to tell there's actually espresso in it.   So that's the lowdown on the coffee.  Now let's talk buttons: There are hundreds to choose from starting at 50 cents. Some are thought-provoking, some are hysterical, some are both. I mean, who doesn't need a button with a hand-drawn picture of the fabled tortoise going down on the fabled hare? I certainly do, and my life is better now that I have one.

The guys over at Mr. Greek have a big challenge in front of them: Their location near 40th and Indian School has tasted a lot more failure than success: the excellent but ill-fated Maxie's World Grill, Coconut Joe's and a pair of barely-there Mexican joints.   Unlike the Mexican incarnations, though, Mr. Greek actually has something tasty to serve. I scratched a pretty serious itch for a gyro platter there. I got a huge mound of gyro meat, an excellent side salad, some lemony roasted potatoes and a scoop of rice. Oh, and some pitas.  The bits of pita were pretty forgettable, but the rest of it was really everything I needed. Not a bit of dryness to the meat, and the side dishes had everything on-the-numbers.  It's a very casual place, so don't expect anything fancy. I had a great time watching a Blackhawks game while inhaling the contents of my platter, which was a nice bit of ambiance for the Chicago native in me (but when the Hawks play the Coyotes, I'm rooting for the Coyotes, thanksverymuch).   Mr. Greek isn't gonna change your life, but it's a nice addition to the neighborhood. Go there, and help these guys from becoming another notch on this cursed location's failure belt.  PS - That's nto the real phone number. I just don't know it.

Sleepy Dog Saloon & Brewery may have the best atmosphere of any brewery around. It's really cool that you can bring your own food - especially with Spinato's around the corner and the Cornish Pasty Co. down the road. Talk about ready-made beer-drinkin' food!   But how's the beer? It's pretty darn good. The recipes seem to skew a bit malty rather than hoppy, so your opinion may vary depending on what you like in a beer. The Scottie is my ... well, I was going to say pick of the litter, but someone probably already beat me to it in a previous review. Kind of a bitch to get into this late. I think we'll see some evolution as the staff experiment a bit more, and it'll be interesting to see if they come up with some wild recipes and maybe even a cask-conditioned ale.  The staff is super-friendly, which makes it fun to hang out while having a few rounds and playing a game of Farkle to the death. In a way, it's practically a brewery with a coffeehouse feel.   I honestly think there is better beer around - like at Sun Up in Phoenix. But I think the beer here is still high-quality, and the very pleasant vibe make it worthy of five stars.

So, does Dolce Espresso Video Coffee Bar suck or is it a beacon of brilliance?  If you love espresso and hang out at places like Sola, Press, Conspire or Cartel, you are not going to strike gold at Dolce. The staff struck out on my americano and cappuccino. The americano was thin and watery. The cap had pathetic, soapy-looking microfoam. Both were way too hot. As in "read 20 pages and then try taking a sip" hot. That's a great way to ruin an espresso drink.  If you want a nice place to hang out and have dessert while watching some music videos (of the lightweight pop variety) at all hours of the night, this is a winner.   Me? I'm too much into my cappuccino to rate Dolce highly. I think it's a great place for certain people. Some will rate Dolce a five, and it's all about what they want in a coffeehouse.

I grew up feeling sorry for Yosemite Sam and Elmer Fudd. All that effort to catch and eat a rabbit, all for nothing. When I got the chance to eat a rabbit bratwurst, I took it. And it was for Sam and Elmer. They probably didn't imagine their rabbit coming with sweet-onion relish, curry catsup or anything called an "ailoli." Their loss.  My wife's lamb brat was just as good as my bunny (I hadn't eaten rabbit since I was something like 5 years old). And we had nary a quibble with the date cake for dessert. It was kind of like an Australian sticky-date pudding, and ranks as one of my favorite non-chocolate-based desserts. I have nothing bad to say about the beer selection, either.   Service? Enthusiastic, opinionated, fast. I love getting a server's honest opinion on their favorites and their suggestions (particularly good for deciding which topping to pair with your rattlesnake/duck/vegetarian bratwurst).

Presentation should never take longer than fermentation. But there I was, still thirsty after 15 minutes of waiting for my pint of Norse Legend. When I ordered it, the waiter didn't know what I was talking about. I told him "You know, the sahti (I didn't confuse him by pronouncing it Finnish style) from Sam Adams." Finally, I just gave him the number on the board. Then he scurried off. We never saw him again.   In the meantime, I checked out the food menu. It looked excellent. But we rolled in just as the kitchen closed at 10 p.m. on a Friday. No appetizers, no desserts, no nothin'.   My wife and I tried talking. But the exposed beams and concrete floors and walls that look so nice turn the volume up to where we had to yell at each other. After a few more minutes of waiting and not seeing a familiar waiter, we did something we've never done at a brewery/alehouse/taproom before: We walked out, still thirsty for a quality beer. We went to Sun Up, where we had a cask-conditioned IPA made with Simcoe hops that pretty well destroyed anything on-tap at Angels Trumpet.  We'll give Angels Trumpet another shot in the future - once we hear it has its act together.

So I had a little problem - a valve outside my house looked like someone had dredged it up from the wreck of the Titanic and slapped it onto my house. And a valve on one of my inside toilets sprayed water all over every time I tried to turn the toilet off for any reason ... and that made me nervous that I was going to come home and find my living room looking like Sea World.   A friend recommended ASAP. I actually kind of hate talking on the phone to explain plumbing problems (smartphones - good at almost everything except being a phone). ASAP had an online form, so I filled it out and got a call about an hour later. We agreed to a time.  They said they'd show up between 8 and 10 a.m. At 8:15, they called up to say they were on their way. Ten minutes later, the crew of two plumbers was there. They had a look around and really seemed to know exactly what was going on at a glance. By 10, they were done.   The price seemed reasonable based on my past experiences with plumbers. Both of them were friendly and prompt.  And now, my wife no longer has to share a toilet with me (which is pretty much a condition for continued marriage). It's good to know there is a good plumbing company out there.

I was at a coffee shop in Tempe trying to get some work done, but its Internet had crapped out. I turned to my phone, hoping to find another coffee shop nearby. I know Cartel is nearby, but I hoped for something else. Sure enough, I spied this "Infusion" place right near my old Four Peaks Brewery hangout.  It looks like the area along the old railroad tracks is getting some much-needed love, and Infusion is just one new-looking business that's opened. I saw signs outside advertising two different types of cold brew on tap. I have a hard time resisting cold brew on tap, so that's what I chose rather than my default cappuccino.   It was a very rich, chocolately cold brew. If you ever need to stay up for 137 hours, drink a few of these. The barista helped me choose which cold brew to order with very solid descriptions of their taste. I'm looking forward to trying the other drinks at Infusion.  It is a smaller space, and not quite as comfy or roomy as a few others (especially if you have a small person). But it's definitely a nice space, and they're clearly into making top-quality coffee drinks.
