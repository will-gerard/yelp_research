Waited half an hour for a few burgers. Severely understaffed, huge line, terrible experience. Never again.

Salmon was perfect, sweet potato-stuffed poblano was a little strange. But great atmosphere and great service! I'd come back ;)

We held an event on the Vig's patio and the team was spectacular. After planning this day for months, we arrived and it began to rain. Within minutes they had umbrellas across the whole area. Their team was flexible and attentive. Everyone afterward commented on the great venue and service.  I returned a few days later with a friend - once again, top-notch service. These guys are great at what they do. I'll be back.
