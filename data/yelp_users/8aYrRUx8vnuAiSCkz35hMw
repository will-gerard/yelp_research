I visited over the lunch our.  My friends had a taco salad that was not very good.  My food on the other hand was excellent (the spinach portabella quesadilla). So two bad meals and one good, why the 5 stars, right?  None of us said a word about the meal issues but someone came up and asked if we weren't happy and they told them the beef was a little tough and not good.  Almost immediately the manager shows up apologizing and explained there had been done kind of different meat than usual- they had noticed that they had not fished the meat and so they I wired.  They told us they would discontinue use of that meat vendor and they took it off our bill then brig ought complementary desserts that were also amazing.  My food from start to finish was excellent and the service recovery was impressive.  We will definitely be back!

The food is GREAT!  I love the tomato and basil sandwich, so fresh - I think the bread is amazing!  You can see them in back making it - old school style and it makes a difference.    Also, they make a great tuna sandwich, it isn't on the menu but you can ask for it and it is also worth a try :0)  Only downside, the place gets packed - because it is good!  and the seating is limited, get there early and consider take-out b/c they may not have a place to sit.  Its all about the food!

Dr Pafford is not only a great dentist, he is an exceptionally kind person as well.  He has an obvious passion for helping people and trying to make his patients as comfortable and healthy as possible.  I hate to send him all the difficult people out there like me, he deserves some dentally brave patients so he has an easier job,  but I have to say, if you are one of those people that is terrified of going to the dentist, this is where you belong!  He is very gifted in the art of making you feel calm and alleviating your fears.  He is also very active in the community and an advocate for promoting the advancement of ethical and competent dentistry.  I've had other experiences that were not good in different dental offices, I'm so thankful I've found Dr. Pafford and hope he never moves or retires :-)

I really liked this restaurant!  The atmosphere is safari themed but not tacky.  The waitress was good and friendly.  I sampled dishes from other family members' plates so I had a little taste of everything.  Overall I liked everything.  It has a lot of light yet tasty choices and many unique flavor combinations.  Will be sure to go again!  LOVED the Rum Colada :-)

I have now had 3 bad experiences at Gordy's so I think I will go ahead and assign the sad "one star".  1st experience:  My husband drops off a bike for repairs and pays up front.  I pick up the bike a week later and get charged the same amount - as they claimed he had not paid for it.  Sure enough I found I'd been charged twice for the same work.  I told them this when I went back in for bad experience number 2 and they had no interest in fixing the previous mix up.   2nd experience:  I brought in a bike for repairs and also wanted to purchase a brand new bike.  They make a ticket for the little bike I brought in and don't ever take it back.  It took FOREVER for the person to process the new bike for me - mostly because he kept talking to people.  He kept disappearing and seemed kind of lost as well.  At the end, I've purchased a new bike and they say they will come and help me load it into the truck.  It's a large men's mountain bike and had my bag and small child with me.  The sales guy actually starts talking to a customer as he is walking back to get the bike for me and never comes back!  I'm not sure if he had a massive attention deficit issue or what but then he (and an employee that is just standing around doing nothing) see me trying to keep ahold of my kiddo, my purse, and steer a bike that is way to big for me (because it was a gift) out of the store.  And no one offered to help at all.  I felt that was a big slap in the face when I've just purchased the bike, talk about buyer's remorse.  ALSO, just to drop off the bike for repairs and  to purchase a new bike (which I knew which one I wanted when I walked in the door and didn't need anytime to think it over) took ALMOST TWO HOURS!  Had I not been SO desperate to get out of that place, I would have asked them to just return it because they were so incredibly rude immediately after I gave them the money for the new bike.    3rd (AND FINAL) experience:  My husband goes to pick up the bike that was repaired (at least it was suppose to be repaired).  They can't find it.  He is there for almost an hour and after they find it, low and behold, nothing had been done to the bike.    I think that they probably do good work on bikes (if they get around to doing it), as in, they are probably good at the  "hands on" part of the work and if you don't mind waiting for lengthy periods of time AND if they don't lose your bike.... THEN you may find them to be a good fit.   But they are horribly unorganized and have serious customer service issues.  -- To clarify, they have never been rude, just painful unorganized and they have no sense of urgency or appropriate professional courtesy.

I went to Rose for eyelashes as a referral from a friend that goes regularly - she put on a full set and they are beautiful - I get compliments ALL the time.   They were well priced considering the time it takes to do such detailed work.  Rose is now at Classy Nails at 90th & Shea.  I'm not sure who does lashes now at Elite but I think they still offer the service.

So I tried this place a couple of times before deciding to give it this review.  Which worked out well because it would have been just one star after my first visit.    My first visit was well over a year ago - it took me that long to get over the experience to the point that I was willing to give it a second try.  It is cute and seems like it SHOULD be good.  Just a "down home" kind of feel with little country black bears everywhere.    Our first time we sat forever before anyone came.  As we waited for our food we saw our waitress get into a confrontation with what appeared to be a manager or something and then the next thing we knew we saw her storm out of the diner crying.  We didn't really know what to think but after a while our food still hadn't come and our waitress was MIA.  So we asked someone about our order, then waited a long time again and finally got it.  I had a battered fish dish and became nauseated and sick later that evening.  My husband had the meatloaf, which was a 2 on a scale of 1-10.   And even after it became obvious to the staff that we didn't have a waitress anymore, they brought us the food and then never came back.  We had to hunt down someone to give us a check to be able to leave.  Gave it a second try recently.  The food didn't make me ill this time so that was a plus.  Our waitress didn't leave the building, also a vast improvement from the last time. But our wait for the food to come was pretty long and unfortunately it wasn't so great that you felt the wait was worth it.    But the food wasn't terrible, it just took a long time and wasn't that good.  Had the wait not been so long I might have even thrown in an extra star on this review.

On June 15th I visited the Goodwill location at the 4147 W Thunderbird Rd, Phoenix, AZ.  I was there to drop off two trash bags full of donation clothing.  While I was there, my teenage son wanted to look around.  I found an XBox360 for sale for $70 and a jacket for $10 that I decided to purchase.  I was not familiar with their policies because I have not shopped there before but have rather just donated.  So I asked the cashier about the XBOX and if it worked or not.  She said she didn't know so I asked if I bought it and it didn't work if I could return it.  She said that was no problem and I said, okay, well, I guess I have nothing to lose as long as I can bring it back if it doesn't work and return it for my money back --- I mean,come on, its an XBOX for $70, I figured it didn't work but thought, "what the heck, If I can bring it back, why not?".  The cashier, Jamie made me feel like it was safe to try.  I took it home and found that it did not work.  I took it back within one hour of purchasing it.  I was told by Ruth that they could only give me store credit.  I told her that Jamie had told me that I could get my money back if it didn't work.  Ruth told me that I should have been aware of their policy because it is posted in the store on a poster hanging above the entrance and on my receipt.  However, I would not have seen this unless I looked up or had already purchased it in order to have the receipt.  At that time, Jamie walked past me and I asked her why she had told me I could return it for my money back.  She said that she thought I could.  So I asked Ruth why, if an employee didn't know the policy, that I was expected to know it?  I told Ruth that I would like to speak to a manager.  She said that there wasn't one available and she would have them call me.  I asked when that would be and she didn't know.  I said, well should I just leave the purchases there and then decline the charges with my credit card.  She said what ever I did was up to me and was very rude.  I said that since she wasn't giving me any options I would just leave everything with her (including the jacket because I was going to try to get my money back from the credit card company).  So I left everything with her because I told her I would be contacting my card company to dispute the charge.  So I took a video of all the merchandise and Ruth taking it and making a note of it on the receipt (which she kept).    One week later, Ruth called me to tell me she couldn't get her district manager to deal with the issue, nor to even call me.  She told me she could not give me his name or his phone number.  And that I would just need to deal with my credit card company with my issues.    My credit card company denied the dispute because I had nothing in writing - my video was not suitable proof.    Before writing this review I called and spoke with Ruth one last time to ask if I could please speak with the district manager because I planned to file a complaint with the BBB (WHICH BUYER BEWARE, THEY ARE NOT MEMBERS) if it could not be resolved.  She said he was on vacation.  And although she was unwilling to give her district manager's name or phone number.  She did tell me that she was given another district manager as their contact person while her manager is on vacation, whom I also wasn't able to reach (surprise, surprise) .   Here are the key issues that I feel warrant this review and my claim to the BBB.   #1) The fact is that I have spent $80 in a store and have no product(s) or services to show for it.   However, I do have a video showing me leaving everything with Ruth and vocalized everything happening in the video #2)  The employee, Jamie TOLD me that I could return the XBOX if it didn't work for my money back and they should honor what they said.  Especially since I have been a great donator to this location.  It is very close to my house and I bring all of my children's outgrown clothes and toys as donations.  The irony of it all is that I actually donated more that $80 worth of items on the day that this horrendous customer service experience occurred. #3)  The policy to only give back store credit, while posted in an area of the store - was not well known, because even their own employee was not aware of it.  Also, having it printed on the receipt is illogical because you don't get a receipt until the transaction is already done.  I don't think that my first trip purchasing something in the store should make me more aware of this policy than a store employee knows.

This place is GREAT!  I have only eaten there once now but had a very tasty burger, sweet potato fries and a green tea. All of which were very good, served by friendly staff and it didn't take too long to get our food either.  If you are into teas, try their iced green tea, it was the best I've EVER had!  The burgers were pretty big, come hungry!

Called for a broken refrigerator and a technician was able to come and fixed the issue within hours of my call.  Professional, courteous, and knowledgeable.  I will keep their number for all my appliance repairs.  Highly recommended.

First of all YOU CAN GET GOURMET PIZZA, BEER AND WINE IN THE DRIVE THRU!!!  That alone gets them some stars in my book!!!   The staff have always been good.. Even when I was with a group of NINE eight year-old boys, our waitress had the patience of a saint.  The people eating there are usually pretty friendly - more than what you normally find randomly dining  - just lots of super chill folks there... My theory is that the place is so good, it puts guests in a good mood so everyone is happy and friendly.  Or maybe it just makes me feel so happy that I see it all that way, either way... a good experience all around.    My favorites here:  The "At Last", "The Answer" and "Sweet Potato" Pizzas - all very unique and unlike your average pizza joint.  AMAZING!  Oh, and I hate brussel sprouts but the way they make them, they are actually good to me - so I am no longer a "brussel sprouts hater"

This is a great place to meet up with friends.  They do a great job of keeping the climate livable outdoors.  You can play corn hole (but get there VERY early - people go and check out the bean bags then sit on them for hours- frustrating that no one is playing it but yet all the bags are checked out). Getting paddles for ping pong isn't too tough though.     The food is good (all from the Culinary Dropout) - l LOVE this pretzel dish, you get a fondue pot of cheese with these yummy soft pretzel balls (highly recommend).   I love to take my older kids (teens) before the evening crowd - only downside is now they have to have parents right beside them just to play corn hole (at 2:00 in the afternoon this seems kinda silly to escort my 18 y/o son to play corn hole).  They have to be 21 to be unaccompanied   But especially if everyone is over 21, it is a fantastic venue and really a fun place to be - a great addition to the North Central Phoenix scene!  But expect that it is super crowded and loud if you are going to go at prime times because it is a very popular place to be.  If you don't like crowds- go early

It was kind of hit and miss at this funky little western themed place.  For those that are not interested in waiting for the perpetually long wait list at TX Roadhouse there on restaurant row on 83rd, this is a great alternative.  You can still play cowboy and have good food without the wait.    THE PROS: Easier to get into than the other places if you're at prime dinner time on 83rd Ave.  And there is ample parking (also a contrast to the prime strip of places on 83rd  REALLY good drinks and a very liberal happy hour (even on Saturdays!!) Nice assortment of drinks too, they have a "hand crafted moonshine" drink menu.  I got the Pineapple Express and was not disappointed.  Nice outdoor sitting area with some couches if you just want to have some drinks and munchies  The food I tried was good.  Little pulled pork sliders and the spicy mac 'n cheese  If you're into fun and western decor, be sure to check out the bathrooms with their wash bucket sinks and stall door locks that are actually barn stall locks... kinda cute details.  THE CONS: When we first got there it was pretty early and the service was great.  After the place started to pick up a little the service seemed to suffer.  The first half of our experience was a vastly different customer service experience than the second half.  We almost gave up on getting our dessert, it just took SOOOOOO long.  And it was one of those things that is a brownie in the skillet and it is suppose to be a little gooey on the inside... As it turned out, it was completely raw inside - which was rather surprising considering how long we waited for it.    My hope is that this was just an issue of being newly opened and that they will get in the groove and the busy hours won't trip them up.   I will defiantly give it another try.  Aside from our dessert, it was all very good.  Friendly wait staff too.

Great food- especially if you are into Italian meats & anti pasta dishes.  This is a fun place to go but the volume is loud so if you are wanting a quiet dinner spot- this isn't it.  If you want lively & fun, it's a good bet!

I tried a kickboxing class- they offer your first one free, they then gave me a free 2 week pass.  The staff was very friendly and the people attending were a good diverse group people of varied fitness levels w/ the majority being women.  The class I attended was kickboxing on a Monday at noon.  It was a great workout & music that fit in really well.    Another reviewer commented on all the empty space and that they should fill it w/ more equipment.  However, this space is used during different phases of the classes taking place so that actually makes sense.  But when you first walk in you do feel like it is kind if empty so I can see why that was mentioned - but it is actually a good thing & all of the things one actually NEEDS to get in / stay in shape are there.    The only thing that I could suggest is the option of mats for the floor work portion of class.  Also, the gloves they gave me were kinda stinky... I would suggest buying/ bringing your own .   Overall, I plan to go back- it has what you need & seems more friendly & less boring than the usual /typical gym.
