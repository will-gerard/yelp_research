Seriously the best sushi in the AZ. I've been to over 15-20 in the valley. The owner, Toshi, knows his craft coming from Japan.  His nigiri is cut exquisitely, as well as the maki rolls. Do yourself a favor and have dinner here in this mom and pop sushi joint you won't regret it.

I've had bagels around Az for the past 10 years. This place is definitely the best, the owner has another location in New Jersey. Great service and food! Highly recommended.

Been to so many sushu restuarants in Arizona and California. Nigiri was below average, (too much fat from a lean salmon and tuna), maki rolls were ok...there are better restaurants out there for the same cost. People were nice though!
