I was a regular customer for years. .I ordered the beef burrito the last two times. Both time there was a HUMAN HAIR in the burrito. Needles to say I got sick the last time and will never be back again!

Very honest and reliable for years. Business went down and had my tranny pulled because he knew I had credit cards. Third tranny pull on my car by greedy asshats. Ended up getting a new car instead.

They "donate" almost everything you bring in.188 donations in one year! I have heard they have an underground shop in Prescott. I will never consign there again.

I went there on Thanksgiving with a singles group. Nice atmosphere and an excellent server, but the meal was nasty. I wasn't even going to touch the yams! Apple pie was crusty and hard..no desire to finish it. We really enjoyed the rocking chairs though!

Absolutely the best auto repair shop in town! Very honest and reasonable. There are always cars wrapped around the lot. They will never be at a loss for business! Thanks guys!
