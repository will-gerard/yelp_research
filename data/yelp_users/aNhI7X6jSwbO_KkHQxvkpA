I eat here quite a bit, I'll be honest, the food is good but last two visits they have skimped on the meat. I guess times are tough for all of us. If you are feeling adventurous try the spam masubi, you won't regret it.

I have eaten here many times over the years. Last few times I came in was poor. Today will probably be my last visit. I sat and watched families who parked their car and we're seated before my family. Same size families I might add. Dirty floors, good ol country grandma's food straight out da box. The food is fine. If you are hungry with for kids don't come here. If you don't mind waiting for mediocre food and you are a patty of two, this is your place. It hasn't always been like this. Other locations don't have these issues. They must have had a management change in the past few months. Bye the way I haven't even gotten my food yet. Cracker barrel will have my business, just not this location.

Super fun place to go. Staff is nice. Check out the wall of pez. Great for pez collectors like myself. They appear to have every brand of candy imaginable. All the favorites are here available individually or bulk. The only negative thing about this place is that it's crowded, but you would expect that with any place where everyone wants to go.

I don't always find what I'm looking for, but it's always a good time walking around this place. Neat stuff, I could do without the arts and crafts but overall fun place.

I heard about this place for a while now. This is my kind of food! I had to slow down when ordering because I  was thinking with my stomach and not my head. You gotta try the big beef with the hot peppers and mozzarella, you won't regret it. While eating my sandwich I realized I came to a hot dog joint and didn't eat a hot dog,  So I did. The hot dogs are great with everything on them. Great setting for a family! It's definitely the place to go to break your diet.

Full disclosure, I am related to the owner. Regardless,  I would and do recommend aqualung vapor supply to anyone interested in quitting tobacco. Josh and Matt got me set up with a small vape setup a few months back. Long story short... I stopped smoking overnight. Every time I stop in to the shop Josh and Matt are there to help. Five months tobacco free. Juice selection is great. Stop in and check em' out.
