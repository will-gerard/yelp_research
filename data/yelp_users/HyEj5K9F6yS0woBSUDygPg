So I'm sure like most guys this is not a place you would want to spend a Friday or Saturday night at a theater..... But it was date-night with the Girl and I saw there was Hairspray showing at this theater. Once again not how i want to spend a weekend night but I know my GF and she loooooves that musical. So being the good guy I am I got tickets.      I was expecting to go and sleep through the show and call it a night......however once the lights went down and the show started I was blown away! The cast was awesome there were no mess ups and everyone was on key. I really enjoyed myself, everyone was enthusiastic and professional the guy playing the mother was fantastic and it was all around a great time. I am for sure going to make this a date-night staple from now on..... Hope they bring the Producers soon.

The food is great (bar food: hamburgers, wings, fish and chips etc) and its not to pricey, possibly the best food prices you'll find in old town if you are looking to go out. The coolest part of this bar by far is the night time activities. The 2x4 jenga, the gold fish races, the midget bar (the little women who runs it is actually a really hot little person), the wheel of drinks, the plunger: all amazing.  I thought it would be funny to ICE a buddy of mine (get an unsuspecting person a Smirnoff Ice, which they then have to kneel down and chug) and the bar staff decided to ice me, the shenanigans are fantastic. Ill take this bar over the up-you-ass snotty clubs any day or night.

The food is ok, I went with my significant other before we caught a show the other night. We got there in time to catch the happy hour menu, even those prices we're more than i would pay for the food. The food was pretty standard sushi the only thing that stands out about it was the mediocre presentation, the forever wait, and the ridiculous prices for what you got.... IT WAS JUST SUSHI!  However she got a saki sangria and she loved it.

It seems to be a new place...... they came in like a wrecking ball..... in my mouth. I wish this place would stay a local secret......  however, this food tastes like it was hand crafted by Jesus Christ, therefore it would be a sin not to tell everyone. F=*king incredible, seriously I'm fairly positive the portabello ravioli gave me super powers, the white sauce it was covered in satiated me to use my new found pasta powers for good, so I went home. ALSO they serve, and deliver the greatest five letter word in the English language P I Z Z A. Haven't tried it yet but I assume its great because everything these people do is great, therefore it's on my bucket list of things to eat before I die.

Their food is good, the people are friendly, the beer list is awesome. Seriously, this place may be Hipster Central but the food is great and the craft beer selection (which explains the hipsters) is out of this world. The atmosphere is somewhere between hip and sports bar, it's weird but it works. The place is a neighborhood staple and a haven for those who are "too cool" for mill (or not a 21 year old, either or). I'd get the wings if I were you.       Bust out the American Spirits, grab some flannel, grow a beard, and order a nice tall craft beer and this place feels like home.

I love Teharu, I constantly compare this restaurant to the uber expensive sushi places and it not only holds its own but in many cases (like the Vegas roll) it blows places like RA out of the water. The best part is its 1/4 the price of other places. Word of caution is the lunch and dinner rushes are nuts so go at an odd time like 1:30

I've had this dream to be Samurai since I was little. I would to eat sushi, drink Sake' and charm Geisha's all day. Then I would go pillage and fight other Samurais' with a bad-ass sword. Anyways, that never happened but this sushi is really fresh and good so you should eat here.   The Saki is warm, delicious, and goes well with cold beer.   The Chef is a awesome, he makes badass sushi.   If you can't be a Samurai...... Eat here.

This restaurant is a testament to the golden rule of restaurants around phoenix. While there are many nice places to eat with a lot of ambiance and good food, the restaurants with the BEST food will be in little nothing-special-easy-to-miss-places. Another little rule to go by when eating in phoenix is: if the food is ethnic and people who are of that ethnic background are cooking the food, then it's going to be awesome. If you want ambiance go to a museum, If you want killer food around Phoenix then places like Hunan Express are the way to go. I will definitely be making Hunan express a weekly tradition.   Hunan Express conforms to the rules and as expected, the food was insanely good. My brother and I ordered take out, we shared the $20 dinner special (which says feeds 2-3 it actually could feed 4 easily) when we started eating we both had the same epiphany "holy shit this food is awesome". the Eggrolls were delicious and the egg drop soup kicked-ass. go with the Hunan chicken you won't be sorry.
