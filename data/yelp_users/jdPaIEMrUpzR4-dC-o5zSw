I came in to buy ammo and left with plenty of it. The owner helped me make some perfect Keys that wal-mart keeps screwing up on. Their paint is always incredible. We are about to get a few new hoses from the lawn and Garden department. It's a shame he was out of 22 today.

Although they were busy I was not happy sitting waiting in the doctors office for 53 minutes. No one came in to let me know they are running behind. They have been my doctors office for 3 years. My old doctor is retiring so now I need to find a new doctor. Completely unsatisfied at the results of the waiting time and time on hold to be able to speak with a human to schedule! I has happy they got me in the same day with a different doctor because I blew out my knee which is why I am giving 2 stars instead of one!

Loved that they did not try to gouge me! They took care of our cat, will be watching him if and when we every head out of town. Liked them so much I took a pic with the doc that is the storefront photo.

Great donuts, a little hard to find but worth the hunt. Must taste their cronuts and their apple fritters. My wife loves the chocolate chip rolls. They can also make your next party cake. We have had them make a birthday cake and a anniversary cake in the past. Always excellent!

The rooms are clean they don't charge for water bottles inside of our room. They would get a lil bit better review if the quality attention to detail was there. The buffet in the resort was okay I was very glad they had a to go box. This works great in a very time crunch

My client who owns a body shop is standing here with me as we wait for his car to be towed. Zane uses KJR Towing all the time I can't wait to meet this guy he said he'll be here in 12 minutes how's that for accuracy and quickness

We called around to find a printer that wanted my new business if we could get theirs. I send printers about 30-50 deals a year because I help business owners grow their business. We were told that we could quote their business insurance after we purchased business cards through 3 monkeys. A month later we FINALLY have subpar quality cards. Ryan is a new employee of mine and needed cards. I told him to get it done three to four times. It took 4 weeks to get business cards that should have taken maybe a week or two to finish. After he received his cards he was told they already found a new insurance company. This is shady to me. If I say I am going to do something I am going to do it. We chose them because they had good reviews when we started. Good luck!

It took three weeks to get anything back to Ryan, even with the warning of being pixelated. Just disappointed that Ryan was not given the ok to talk shop once we had our business cards completed. He was told that three monkeys would let us work on their work comp. Due to the communication I give them a 2 star rating. Ryan was up front saying if he gets a chance to quote insurance with three monkeys, he would do the business cards with them! Its not cool to get our business when it was established what we were in agreement with.

We went in for the steak and shrimp advertisement that was posted outside but it was so smoky we couldn't even go in and stay. We went upstairs to the buffet it looked ok not very many selections though so after dealing with the smoke and the not so plentiful Buffet we decided to take off

Went in here years ago and boycotted ever since. This should be a place of gun safety but instead the kids run around with fingers on the trigger pointing guns at peoples heads while not in a match waiting instructions. I spoke with the manager several times and he talked to his team a few times.   I gave a bad review years ago and he retaliated against my business which he has never had an experience with. I legitimately gave them business and he never worked with mine. To give me a bad review after leaving them one just shows a lack of integrity.  Even though it is paintball, kids at the learning stage should still be taught correct gun handling and safety procedures! I left a 1 star review years ago and the owner retaliated and left my business a 1 star review without ever working with me. That was the ultimate lack of integrity!

Tabi did a great job. It was my wife's birthday so we have the 4 of us here for dinner. We all ended up getting cheesecake and having dinner. I'm kind of picky so I have lots of special requests. She did so good I gave her way better than 20% tip. Ask for Tabitha for awesome service with a smile

The burgers were great too bad that our orders were messed up. I also have to cut them a star because the Mountain Dew was out and they didn't have any to replace it with. I would gladly come back again I just hope my order is correct next time. They do give a military discount. I am giving an extra star because they're veteran friendly

They did a great job on my roof, the experience though was horrible. The salesman left my file in the office when he quit, the new manager found 17 files that some were already paid for. I called a few weeks later to say WTH and lets get my roof done. As an insurance guru I need to refer good companies. They did great work, their staff are irresponsible, unreliable, and not trustworthy. I hate giving bad reviews. It doesn't help anyone. The manager now in charge also doesn't return phone calls. I had a client in my office to send him a referral and he never called me back asking for the clients name or number.

Brian was incredible in explaining the options of what size unit I should use without upselling me. I know they take pride in cleanliness, security, and customer service.

I had Blu Ox out twice from my home warranty. I was not upset with the warranty, i was upset with the lack of concern the ac guy gave. Yes my contractor was late and he did not have to stay to wait to look at the unit. He did ultimately wait but made me call the contractor three times while waiting. The contractors' truck had the gas siphoned so he had to get gas and push his truck to the gas station mid route. The AC guy said there is nothing wrong with our unit and I am used to Gas Ac systems which are better. After he left I asked the contractor what to do, he said it's a home warranty they never want to do anything. A few days later our heat does not want to heat so I called my warranty again. They sent the same guy back out. I think he was frustrated because he was called back out and had to drive from Glendale to the East valley. He showed up again, i had a list of questions from an AC friend, so he knew he had to be on his toes. He answered all the questions. He was kind of rude telling me to be quiet while he is doing a trouble shoot. I understand I had questions, he knew that I have people that were trying to help me. It was implied that i know people, why wouldn't he go above and beyond trying to figure out the issue.  He left shortly after maybe spending 10 minutes total on the diagnosis.  Today the system was not working again. I call my warranty to complain saying I refuse to let Blue Ox back in my home. They said they can send a senior tech out. I told the gal that he was a 20yr plus veteran with AC you can't get much more senior. She gave me a closer company to my home. Eric came out with a different company, looked over the inside air handler, the outside system, gauges, wires, you name it. He did find the Defrost board was bad. The Blue Ox guy did not even take the time to look at the attic. Eric with the new company said home warranties are good when you get good people. You may just need to call in and ask for someone different to do the job. Eric said the new board could be a few hundred dollars maybe even $600. I paid around $400 for the warranty.

I drove from Gilbert to Scottsdale last week to see Dr Marino. I used to go to chiropractors in Mesa but I got tired of seeing doctors that did not fix me. My neck would not turn all the way to the left or right after 2 major car accidents almost ten years ago. I am not able to get a bit better range of motion as he called it. I think I have another appointment in two weeks. I am happy to spent the drive time!

Faith is amazing, I saw faith for a long time until I moved an hour away. My wife actually has a hair license but will only see Faith for her cuts, style, color, or whatever else she has done. My wife works in Scottsdale and drives from Gilbert. Funny thing is, is she has clients that drive from Queen Creek and Peria to see her. Faith Fixes $15 haircuts. She does not pay for reviews like a lot of stylists. Instead she gives her clients a free cut when her clients refer her business.

I almost cried after watching one of Life's Story Studios wedding boutique films! They can do weddings, bar/batmitzvahs, portraits, corporate headshots, promo videos; pretty much you name it they can do it . Even though he's a religious son of a bitch, I had fun working with him and I will always have fun working with him and Amy.   For 2 hours we laughed our butts off getting the amazing images that we did. He let me be who I am which is a crazy nut.

Dr Rooh helped me get around my health insurance not wanting to cover my headaches. I wanted an MRI to diagnose what is the underlying issue. He has given me some other ideas and help for my thyroid, blood sugar (diabetes), and my back pain. I understand he loves to help people with hormonal imbalances and reversing issues naturally. He has free seminars all the time helping people to understand and fix their issues.

I met with Jamie and Tony to get my business card head shot done a few weeks ago, they were fast, affordable, and professional. I was happy to drive from Gilbert to Tempe to have my photography needs met. They were also very pleasant and fun to work with. I will be going back for my wedding anniversary photos, maybe some glamour pics for my wife.  Its too bad I did not know them when we got married as our photographer we used was just ok and did not provide the follow up that Julius's gave me!

I have had Carmen's Cake Pops many times. I love them. I have sent her many clients because her gift giving program is awesome. Her customer retention program is incredible. She drove all the way from Tolleson to Mesa to meet and deliver Cake Pops. Next I want brownies and some dark chocolate popcorn. If you want to thank a client or start building your business by actually thanking people call Q-Tsie!  I love that she works with great people.

Serena was amazing with showing us potential homes. I loved that she was willing to drive in Tempe, Chandler, Gilbert, and Mesa. She showed us a couple foreclosures and one short sale. She advised us that short sales could take a few months or longer. We finally decided on a home in Tempe which was near the university with out an HOA that would still rise in value. She was always on time, pleasant to work with, and answered her phone. I loved that we could communicate with quick questions on facebook. Call her she is amazing!

Vitaliy came to my house a few weeks ago to help me drain my hot water heater. We found a lot of calcium deposits as expected. A homeowner should drain their heater every 6 months to a year depending on usage. While he was at the house he also came upstairs to check our master bath room shower drain. His snake was more effective than Draino.  Next he walked 10 feet to my wife's drain on her side of the bathroom. Having a woman with long hair before us and my wife also having long hair, lets just say he was able to open the drain. Happy to have a good plumber local to me!

I met with Laura Lee to help discuss how we can help our businesses. While we're doing that she gave me a great psychic experience. After about seven cards I got to see some insight into what she does. Something few people will ever get to experience but something everyone should. She was talking to me a little bit about my career , my relationships, and my family and a little bit more about her travel. It's been a long time since I experienced tarot cards and getting a free experience for a couple minutes was awesome. If you want help growing your business you really should sit down with Psychic Extraordinaire
