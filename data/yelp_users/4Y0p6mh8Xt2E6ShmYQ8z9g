We went as a family and each of us purchased a different combo. It looked like and interesting concept but we did not finish the meals. The chicken had a boiled texture that was rubbery. The pork was tendure and had a good flavor but overall we did not enjoy the meals. The mixture of latin and asian was not something that mixed well with us. The service was good and they were friendly.

I wanted to give my wife a massage after her graduation. Both my mom and mother in law were in town from the east coast and Central America. This was the first time I had all three of the greatest women in my life were all together so I purchased a massage for my wife, mom and mother in law. *Quick Note* I bought my wife a massage two years ago but when she went into the location she did not like the environment so she never used the service. When I heard that Niccol took her work into her clients home so I was confident that having Niccol come to our house would help with the uncertainty my wife had of not having a massage before. I was right! All three ladies received a massage and they were very pleased with Arizona Massage & Healing.

My wife and i have been looking for a place that has great walnut shrimp and chow mein. We found this place in yelp and it was a success!! We gad the calamari mixed chow mein and walnut shrimp and they were all really good. An added bonus is that they were super fast from order to having our dinner on our table. They have a great atmosphere for a date night.  We will be returning often!!
