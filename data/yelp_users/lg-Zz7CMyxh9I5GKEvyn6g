Agree with the other two in regards to this subway. I've to this one before and never really had a problem, staff was cool and friendly and had my orders ready when I arrived. Recently, TWICE, I faxed in an order get there and it wasn't done, they offered to make it and deliver it.. cool thanks... Now again fax in order wasn't ready! Then said he received no order, mind you I'm looking straight at the fax with my order and point down, gives me that "I'm a dumb fuck look" and responds o! well if you want to wait I can get the order ready for you.. I FAXED IT IN SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT!!, mind you that there are 8 people in line ready to order. NEVER AGAIN WILL THIS PLACE ERAN MY BUSINESS. Every time I place an order it's for at least 10-15 subs... that sounds like a loss of profit to me!  GO TO JIMMY JOHNS!!!! They mange to take their orders in and actually make them!

It's like that whole in the wall kinda restaurant, many people won't think to stop by and give it a try, one cuz of the way the place looks and two the area. I grew up in possibly the worst part of town back in the day so $#@! like that doesn't bother me. I stopped up cuz they came up on my yelpinator and had good reviews. They staff is cool and friendly and they have good rates.. like everyone else said CASH ONLY. The guy at the register was nice enough to let me go to the ATM down the street and bring him the money. Plus the $2 off for the check in, sign me up.. $13.00, for the special, cleaned inside and out.

We found this place through Groupon and decided to give it a try. The place is nice the staff was great, but I couldn't say the same for the food. The chicken tasted like it had frost bite and was cooked; grabbed from the freeze and put on the fryer. There not much else I could say becuz there really is nothing else to say. Will I be back, that would be a negative ghost writer.

Well the stars don't lie, this place isnt so great. I can say I didn't have an issue with the staff, everyone seemed pretty cool and friendly. We sat at the bar and the bartender acknowledged us when we sat down. Got us menus and water right away and gave us some time to look over the menu. We ordered the lettuce wraps, mushrooms and mussels. Well every review you read on hear is pretty accurate about how crap the food is, except the biscuits they were actually good and not salty like some people claimed. The wraps were okay but the breeding on the shrimp was over seasoned, the mushrooms are pretty much frozen and fried, I've gotten better shit from the freezers at the whole in the wall grocery store with expired labels... I was poor at a point in my life don't judge.  And the mussels were dry not seasoned and COLD! SICK! I really do yelp places to read reviews as well as rating and I would have not even given this place a chance to prove their horrible rating but the fact that I got a gift card for this place was the only reason I even stepped foot in here. Will i return? NO will I recommend to people I know? HELL NO... WOULD I RECOMMED IT TO THE YELPER READING THIS RIGHT NOW? F##K NO! This place is a chain known accross the country where the hell is the marketing department from the corporate office in finding out why their location sucks balls and has a rating less than a motel 6?!? SMH

The fajitas are always good, but the place seriously need a renovation.. It still looks the same from when I was kid.. LOL .. They also need more beers on tap cuz this 3 beer selection just doesn't cut it. Other than that I would recommended this place to anyone anytime.

From the second I walked in to the second I walked out these guys were great! Everyone was very friendly and helpful. All information of the vehicles were provide and what best fit my budget and expectation of the vehicle I was looking for. From the Salesman to the Financial Officer, everything was simple and easy, no pressure to try and sell me upgrades or extra options and they took the time to listen to what I needed and what I could afford. Everyone always gets that bad feeling that "OH MY GOD LETS SEE HOW THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO SCREW ME OVER" but this is that kind of place you don't have to worry about. If you want the best and hassle free, go see these guys! Ask for George Salman and tell them JESUS sent you! hahaha

This place is great! The food is amazing and the staff is very friendly and helpful. If it wasn't a Sunday night I probably would have drank like 5 DAS BOOTs, just kidding they don't have those, but I would have had at least 2 or 3 MASS of beers. One thing everyone talks about in regards to this place is their GIANT pretzel which is very good. I am a big fan of the variety of food they have and the imported beers you really can't find anywhere else in the area. If you ever feel adventurous and a person that likes to try new things, I would highly recommend this place. I don't live in the area but if I did I would probably be here at least 2 or 3 times a week, the pretzel and Uber would be my best friends.

You can't go wrong with an in and or burger, and there really isn't much to say because that all they pretty much have. This location is nice and clean and the staff is great. Only complaint i have was the obnoxiously loud retarded high school kids, and them not having respect for the older folks outside who came to have a nice meal and chat. Poor people had their attention more to them than their actual food.

This place is cool, I usually come on Wednesday becuz its wing's Wednesday's and you cant go wrong with that. The bartenders are cool and nice to talk to, they are pretty flexible about ordering different flavors of wings in small quantities, we have even done 3 wings of each flavor in the book just to try them all. My favorite is the Raspberry and the Garlic.

I live extremely close to this place, and it kills me everytime I drive by it because I want to stop by EVERYTIME! The food is amazing and the staff is great! This is a true family orintated business and ran that way. Peter has been there for a few months now and is an excellent bartender, he's fast friendly and will pretty much put anything together for you if he can. We went in for the pizza and salad, and started thinking about their amazing mussels, unfortunely the ran out! :'-( ... We then asked if they could do the same except instead of mussels to use shrimp, OH MY GOODNESS! Talk about amazingness!! They we cooked to perfection and seasoned just right! We could not stopped eating them! If I wasn't so full from the pizza and salad we spilt I probably would have order another round of the shrimp. He said its vary rare the cooks do special request but being that it wasn't that busy the went ahead on put it together for us. So the key here is, make sure you go on a not so busy night and see what magic that can do do you! Lol

Went here the other day as a co-worker suggested it... got the shrimp and veggie with fried rice...... ehhh... the rice was super dry  and the shrimp and veggies had no flavor! I will say...a little disappointed. Well guess i will venture on to another spot and try it...  EEAY (Explore Eat And Yelp!)

One of the best I've been to in the Valley!! Called in my order for the office, was ready in the time stated, everything was made to the order requested! PERFECT! Food was amazing! They have a simple menu with all the great items of Greek food! It was so good I went twice back to back!  had the Gyro Thursday and the Chicken Souvlaki Friday! delicious!!  ADDED note -- You may want to request for them to poke holes in the boxes for the fries, they get soggy pretty quick... no biggy, just saying.

I was really looking forward to this place being good.. One being that it is down the street from my house and two they have sushi n saki! Well lets just say the 45 mins I was there it took that entire time to get a round of sake bombs (and I was even served the wrong beer on top of that!) and 2 sushi rolls which where not that good. The Vegas rolled tasted like it was cook in months old oil and the califorina roll smelled like old crab that died on the shore of Mexico. Even the people next to me had a big order and got less than half their food, by that time they just said CHECK PLEASE, which is the same thing I did. If you're looking for take out I'm sure this place is okay, but if you're coming for sushi and saki seek else where! The travel will be well worth it! Three words Sakana Sushi Bar

Not bad for what it is, I had their Chicago style dog and it was fantastic. Fresh bread and good condiments. I think I just might have to make a few more stops and try some of their other foods they have to offer. If you are coming down for lunch I recommend calling in your order or getting there before noon, because from the looks of it you may be spending some time waiting to order.

I'm one to always look around for random places that are locally owned and not a franchiase. Came accross this place on my yelp sweep for good breakfast and brunch places. Very nice place with fast and friendly service. Was right away greeted and seated, brought our drinks and took our order. Food was really good, had the Southwest Eggs Benedict. Was full of favor, just wish it had a little more spice as I'm a fan of spicy food. Would I recommend this place to others yes, will I return yes.

This place has great food and a good atmosphere. I have need had a bad roll here and always receive great service. The guys up front know how to do their job well! They usually have some good happy hour specials throughout the week.

Yelp'd this place because my fav. spot was closed today, 43 EXPRESS, on Thomas n 43rd ave, had the pho and egg rolls it was okay, but the service very poor, had to ask 3 different people just to get a refill on water... I most likely wont come back..

Came in to check out the shop and check out some portfolios... Met was Jen, she was awesome! I really didn't know the route I wanted to go with on my arm, one being that the crap I already had needed to be fixed and I just didn't know what else to add. Right off the back she starts firing off some great ideas and had me hooked! So needless to say I set up my appointment and ready to get this done so it's not so embarrassing to wear short sleeve shirts. Lol

A little late but had sometime today to post my review. My appointment was with Jen set for Friday (04/25/14), but due to her prior appointment showing up late, she was kind enough to let me know and ask if it was possible to change my date to Sunday due to a cancelled appointment which would give her the time she wanted to dedicate into fixing my horrid tattoo and adding the stuff she help me put together to due a piece on my left arm. Let's just say I'm glad i did, spent have the day there at the shop, got there about 1pm and was there until 7:30pm. First the master piece she created to put my tattoo together was simply amazing! She then started by fixing the nautical stars I currently have, which just by fixing the outlining pretty much made them look 1000 times better, and went to town on the rest of it. Her creativity is amazing, her lining is amazing, and her artistic style is amazing! did I forget to mention that she is amazing?!!?? Hands down Jen is an amazing tattoo artist and I am really glad she did mine! During the session I did tell her I hated her but that was the pain talking and the fact that everyone at the shop, including herself, couldn't stop talking about these amazing crepes and nutella. You start to get hungry when someone is inking up your body.  I was once told, you see people having no problem spending 200-300 bucks a weekend to go out and eat and drink, but when it comes to marking their body that will last forever, not want to spend a dime. Basically coming down to it, you get what you pay for, you want to spend 50 bucks on a tattoo, then you're going to get a 50 dollar tattoo. But if you want someone who has experience, artistic style, and all around amazing work!! Then i suggest you spend the extra $$$$ and get with a quality artist who will leave you in awww! Jen's rate is VERY reasonable, and for the fact that how good she is I'm surprised I didn't pay more! So if I was you, I'd take advantage like I'm about to do, before she becomes and internationally known artist and can charge whatever she feels like!! LOL :-)  P.S. I do have pictures but I will have to post them from my phone for the fact that I'm writing this review from my computer.

Found out this place finally open so some friends and I here at the office decided to give it a try.... Ordered online... very quick and easy.... Order was ready when requested.... just to add... I had an order of 11 sandwiches.... As there where packing all the sandwiches in a single large bag, I was going to order a drink, and the kind gentleman offered it to me for free.. nice!!.... Got back to the office and everyone was happy... all sandwiches where made to perfection and as requested... nothing missing nothing extra... The Philly was perfect, but I would suggest that you order extra cheese on it if you like'em cheesy.... we will definitely be returning in the near future..

I'm not a big fan of Chinese food but my family is, so I thought I would give it a try. I was very impressed, the food is perfectly and seasoned just right. The beef and broccoli was amazing and the rice was just right. I will be back and to try more things off the menu.

I work in the building where this place is which makes it very hard to resist the Everything Cookie! Hands down my all time favorite and goes great with their variety of ice teas, no sugar of course. If could, I would probably eat one just about everyday, and order three on Friday so I have the weekend covered. Another of my favorites is the Chicken Chipotle really good and priced fairly. If you are ever in the area or visit the office, give this place a try, you will not be disappointed.

Gets really crowded, but they have the best corn and floor tortillas! They make them daily and are just delicious. They often had really good deals on food and stuff, especially on produce and meats. They also have a seafood market with fresh fish, shrimps and much more. If you ever come by make sure you get there really early in the morning or late at night, you won't have to worry about so much traffic and parking. Take some of their rotisserie chicken, you will thank me later!

Was yelping around for a new sushi place in my area and this place came up, read some of the review so I thought I would give it a try. Nice and clean place, staff was very friendly and helpful. You really don't need to look at a menu because every 3-4 seconds something new rolled by your face at the table. Everything was good, I even tried a few things I never even heard of. Overall had a great time and some good food, I will have to return again to check out some more of the cool little plates that roll by the table. hope this is useful in making your choice to come in and check it out!
