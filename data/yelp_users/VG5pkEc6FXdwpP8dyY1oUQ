Hands down, best take out Chinese in Phx/Scottsdale. For 2 of us, We ordered the fried rice to share, orange chicken, sesame chicken and wontons. Everything was amazing - this will definitely become one of our go-to's! Tip: the portions are generous! We were stuffed and hardly made a dent...we would've been fine with just 1 order of chicken and half order of wontons. The people who work there are super friendly as well, so that's just icing on the cake. Love love this place, will definitely be coming back soon!

2 words: Bed Bugs.   I could seriously write for DAYS about this god awful place, all you need to know is - your life here will be miserable. RUN for the damn hills.

About 8-9 months ago, I was experiencing a terrible amount of pain in my neck/shoulders/back - the pain was constant, day in and day out. I was wary of seeing a chiropractor only because I never had before, and I can say confidently that seeing Dr. Thoma was the best decision on my health/wellness that I ever made. He is so knowledgeable about the mechanics of the body, fitness and nutrition, it blows my mind most of the time. He listens to me intently and does a really great job explaining to me why I'm having certain symptoms, what he is working/adjusting as he is doing it, and what small adjustments I can implement in my daily routine to alleviate the symptoms from recurring. Kellie, the office manager, is also really great. She goes above and beyond to work with me on scheduling my recurring appointments (I have an insane work schedule) and is flexible in working with my insurance. Love this place all around!

Wow, I have to say that I don't agree with any of the negative reviews on here. My bf and I lived in a 1-bed at legend from March 2014 to April 2015, and I honestly can't say that we had one bad experience. The complex is a bit older, but we had an upgraded unit and never had any issues with hearing neighbors at all. Never even a TV! The parking lot is HUGE and there are plenty of extra spots (especially compared to most N Scottsdale apts). We did have a few maintenance issues but they always came and fixed within 48 hours. And what's this about $500 AC Bills?! That is ludicrous....I kept the apt at a chilly 69 degrees and we never paid more than $160, so I'm not sure what that's about. All the tenants are very nice, but the complex is very quiet, not at all a social scene, so if you're young (mid 20s) and looking to meet people, look at Ninety Degrees or elsewhere in south Scottsdale. All in all, we had a great experience at Legend and I was sad to leave.

This is the only place we will take our pup to get groomed. They are SO friendly, reasonably priced, and very accommodating. My golden has long hair and is a little scared of the dryer, but they always take the extra time to take care of her. We've never been disappointed.

This place is fantastic. Great food, fun environment and a huge variety, all at a great value. I ordered the Carne Adovada and my boyfriend ordered The Pilgrim, both were amazing. It's all open seating, lots of spots for big groups- I recommend sitting outside on the patio.

Finding this place was SUCH a great surprise. I have a crazy obsession with almond croissants, so When I was running errands this morning and got a craving for something sweet, I popped in here and ordered one. And I have to say, it was one of the best- if not THE best I've ever had (and I've had many!). I ordered to go, but the atmosphere was so stinkin' cute, very Arcadia-esque. I'll be back for lunch soon!

This past Sunday, I threw a baby shower for a friend, and I looked high and low for the "best macarons in town" and this place far exceeded my expectations! For many of the ladies there (myself included), it was their first time having a macaron and they were in love - delicious flavor, perfect texture and beautiful display. I am no professional by any means, but I very much enjoy baking regularly, and I can see that they put an enormous amount of care and attention to detail in their work. Truly amazing. We'll be back for our next party :) p.s. Also tried the almond croissants- so good!

I've picked up dinner from this little place twice, and it was fantastic both times. The food is delicious (huge portions!) and the people who work there are so friendly, generous and accommodating. The last time I placed my order, I called it in (not knowing it was 10 min before closing time- oops!) and the man who answered (I think he was the manager/owner) insisted on staying late to accommodate my order. Great food from great people at a great price :)
