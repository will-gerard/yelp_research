I was excited about going here. My girlfriend and I took her daughter last week. I think its great for kids. We thought there would be lots of things for everyone but mainly geared towards kids. Other that the stuff they always have there, they do have exhibits that come thru for a few weeks or months and those are cool and tend to be a little more for the adults. Anyway I feel this place needs more exhibits for adults to enjoy. Glade that I went but not sure ill be back.I wish I had more to say about this place but I just was not impressed.

Dam I wish I would have known this place was here sooner. Really good sandwiches. They use Boars Head meat which I am a huge fan of. They have so many different sandwiches it took me a while to figure out what I wanted. The menu is kinda all over the place. There is a menu board but its old and fadeed but they have white papers with all the sandwiches hung up all over the wall. The staff  are very friendly and I'm sure this place has many regulars. Inside its a tight squeeze with limited seating. The macaroni salad is great as is the potatoe salad. I love the sicilian sub. The italian dressing on it is so really good and I think thats why I like this sub so much. My other fav is the club on wheat. Oh yeah I think Ill go there agin today. Sanwhiches range from $5.95-6.95.

Cool place! The beer we tried was good my fav was the hefeweizen. The green chili pork with tortillas was really good and I have been back many times for it. The food prices are good and the burgers are good, wings are just ok. The staff is always friendly and quick to get our drinks. Happy we tried this place and its close to home.

I like so many things on the menu it takes forever to decide what to order. You have to keep in mind that you have to save room for the pzookie. This is a must! Pzookie is a huge chocolate chip cookie in a cast iron dish served warm with ice cream on it. UM Yeah, its freakin delicious. Anyway the beefstro salad is awesome. Normally i don't care for steak in a salad but this is very thinly sliced rib eye and its so good, and big enough for 2-3 to share. The wings are really good and they are all drum stick wings and three kinds of sauces. The original is best. The Italian wedding soup with a meat ball is so tasty. The Big Ravioli is really good and stuffed with lots or cheese meat and topped with marinara sauce. But the Chicago Style deep dish pizza is awesome. Its huge very filling so don't order unless your with a group of people. It takes about 30 minutes to make but its so worth it. Just remember to save room for the pzookie. Even if you are stuffed order the pzookie cause when you see it and try it you will finish it!!!

Parking here can be a pain but once you get inside you can have the best Chicken Fried Steak you will ever have. I have driven by this place for years and everyone I have talk to said its great. Not sure why it took me so long to eat here but I will go here every time I'm in the mood for chicken fried steak. The place has a small menu other then that its your average bar. Dart boards, bar, tables, restrooms, but they have freakin UNREAL CHICKEN FRIED STEAK. My girlfriend got the chicken friend chicken and it was good, and it was a huge portion as well but its not as good as the steak. Either one of these dishes can feed two people easily. There was nothing else on the menu I would go back for which is kind of good cause when I go here I already know what I'm getting. They have thousand of business cards that customers have placed all over the walls and celling. Looks cool, but this place could use a dusting! 3 stars but they get a 4th for that Chicken Fried Steak!

I was very surprised with the prices. This place is good and the sushi is cheap. The waitress we had gave us what she called the underground sushi menu. These are creative and all sounded good but we had the April roll. Tempura shrimp. real crab, cream cheese, jalapeno, the whole roll was tempura and topped with spicy tuna. OMG freakin awesome, see pic. I liked this roll so much I went back a few days later and got it again. We also had sesame shrimp with noodles and it was delicious. Great food, and great prices. Good atmosphere and friendly staff.

I have driven by this place so many times and said I want to try this place so bad. I have read good reviews and heard good things from friends. Last night I made there. I will return for sure. Its nice inside. The lighting is a little on the dark side which is good with me. The bar is nice but wish there was more seating. I had the pomegranate margarita and oh yeah it was so good. I only had one cause they were $9 then I just went with water. But the cool thing is they have PBR for $2, got to love that and happy hour form 3-close. Yeah I'll be there. The happy hour menu looks great and cant wait to try it out.   So on to the food. I had the Surf N Turf Pasta. Its is Grilled beef tenderloin medallion and jumbo Sea of Cortez shrimp over fettuccine tossed with tomatoes, mushrooms and sweet corn in a green chile butter sauce. It was delicious. The beef was cooked a perfect med rare and the wood grill flavor really came thru. The shrimp were great wish there was more shrimp. I did get the small portion so more shrimp with the large . Small was $14 large is $18. My friend ordered the Grilled Beef Tenderloin which is Wood grilled 8oz. center cut filet with chipotle cheddar stuffed potato and sherry glazed mushrooms. $27 These mushrooms were like candy they should serve them for an app cause I know I'd get them. I wanted to get dessert but I had a long night ahead of me so I will have to get something next time. I did see a few desserts come out and looked great. Overall the place is great and I have a feeling I will become a regular. The server we had was the nicest guy. He was very knowledgeable of all the menu items and answered all my questions without hesitation. Great food, great service, and good ambiance. I cant wait to try the happy hour menu.

I have been going here for many years now. The food is always good and you always leave full. The tostada is so big I can barley get my mouth over it to take a bite. The shredded beef tacos are great. I also love the flautas and the chicken fajita chimi. The chimi's here are huge! The beans and rice are great to. So many mexican food restaurants have rice that's tasteless, which is funny cause it comes with every plate they serve. You would think they would put some flavor in that rice, but here they do. Always a good meal and I would recommend it for sure.

This place has to be the worst and dirtiest place in town. I have driven by this place my whole life and today I said they have to be doing something right over there cause they have been here for 40 years . How they have been in business this long is beyond me. I'm Italian and I'm embarrassed for these people. This is the worst sandwich, pasta, salad, macaroni salad, and pizza. I'm so mad they have $16 of my money. I wish I would have lost that money so at least I could be happy for making the day of who ever was to find it. But instead I feel ripped off. F$%#ing disgusting, the health department needs to go in here and shut them down. What a disgrace to Italian food. They have a lot of groceries that look interesting but this place is so dirty and cluttered that I don't think they have sold anything off these shelves since opening day 40 years ago.

Not great but I ate it. I think everything just lacked flavor. Americanized Chinese food for sure, and I'm fine with that but everything needed salt or something, weak in flavor. I tried it but wont be back. I wanted to like  it cause I live close by.

I really like this place. I have been going here for years. The pizza is great and they have so many toppings. This place does deliver and they also have a pick up window on the outside of the building in front so you don't have to go inside to pick up your order. I have had so many things so ill make it quick. The red marinara here is good traditional. Its a nice red color with a hint of herbs and Parmesan. They also have a meat sauce that's good. I order the fettuccine with Alfredo, chicken, and broccoli often. The stuffed rigatoni are great as are the ravioli. The other thing I like about red devil is its not over priced like so many Italian restaurants. The food is consistently good here and the prices are right. They have sandwiches and salads as well and of course dessert. I'm always to full to get dessert here.

This place is a great place to see live music. I have been into the local music seen for quit some time now and there isnt one local band that hasnt played here. Great drink prices. And while they are settin up the stage between bands there are always $1 shot specials.  I usually go on a friday or sat night but they have open mic nights as well, I think thats on Monday night. This place has dart boards and pool table as well. All the bartenders are very cool and nice. I really like this place for the cheap drinks, great music and the deversity of people. Also on the weekends there is aguy who sells hot dogs and other great snack foods from a cart. I see more of this popping up around town and I love it. Giant soft pretzels( my fave),hot dogs, polish dogs, chips, etc..

I have been to Sakana twice and really enjoyed what I had. I had the Dynamite Crazy Fire roll and it was delicious. I also shared the Terriyaki chicken dish and it was good as well. I will be back for the roll many times for sure.

Cheba hut kicks ass for many reasons but most important is the sandwiches. They havegood and creative sandwiches on the menu you wont find at your average sanwich shop. I have not had a bad sub yet and I have been going to cheba hut for about 7 years. The theme of the place is all about marijuana and all the sandwiches are named after different strains of weed. Everyone working here is very lax ( i wonder why) and all is very friendly. The get very busy for lunch but its worth it. These sandwiches are toasted to perfection.  They also have brownies, giant rice -crispy treats, and great potatoe salad. If you dont partake in the erb smokin dont let that stop you from eating here. Everything is delicious.

Came here to see my friends band Ashes Of Erin. I'm almost positive I have been to every music venue in the valley and as far as bars featuring live music goes I give this place two stars. I feel like the place is under construction. Needs some paint and something on the walls. Its like being in a garage, so if that's what they are going for then I guess they did a good job. I will say that the stage is nice and lots of room for the band to set up and move around on stage. Many small music venues have the smallest stage like Big Fish Pub where you will often find one or two band members on the floor next to the stage playing cause lack of room on stage. The old guy checking Id's is really funny. I was joking with him about how he has the easy job and he said " yeah I hope I don't have to kick someone else out tonight, and the ones I kicked out last night better not come back cause I remember there faces". The old man is hilarious. The bartender women was very nice but I was not in the mood for beer and they have no hard alcohol so I didn't drink there just watched my friends band and headed out. I would not eat food here but for live music its ok. The sound quality here is just  ok, it could be a lot better.

We ended up going here cause we were in the area and craving sushi. I wish we would have drove a little further cause this place has gone down hill. I used to go here a few years ago and i use to like it. I guess there are so many sushi places now and they are just better than Ra. We got two sushi rolls and i laught when the waitress brought them to the table. These were the smallest rolls I had ever seen and it was not a half portion cause of happy hour or anything. They were as big around as a quarter. No Kidding! I was really wanting to pig out on some sushi rolls but after seeing those we just ordered teriyaki chicken which I have to say was good. Teriyaki is not my favorite but this was alright. I most likely will not be back but if I find myself there I will get a dinner entree and not the sushi. Drinks were stiff and delicous and waitress was good and friendly. Nothing good  to say for the sushi and thats sad when the word sushi is in the name of the restaurant.

Over priced, and that goes for everything on the menu. I was not happy with the size or the taste or lack of taste I shoud say. Over cooked bacon, like a little black, avocado that was brown, and not $10 worth of turkey. I did like the rye bread. I  will come back to try the bagels cause what I saw I liked. If your compairing this place to Chompies then my vote is Chompies hands down no contest. Even thou I spen $10 on a sandwich there I always leave happy, full, and sometimes with a doggie bag cause you get your moneys worth and its good enough to want again later. The inside of this place is really big with lots of seating and a bar as well. The staff was nice and the place was very clean. Ill give the bagels a try sometime.

We went here last night for my brothers b-day. We have heard great things about this place and were very excited. We get there and there was two cars in the parking lot. We almost left and went somewhere else just cause it was 6pm on a sat. night and  we were not sure about it. At the end of the strip mall there is a wine store and bar, so we grabbed 2 bottels of wine and  we went in and sat down( This is a BYOB place). We started off with an antipasto and bread and it was great. Loaded with ham, salami, prosciutto, capocollo, green beans artichoke hearts and fresh mozzarella and tomatoes. By this time the resaurant was getting busy. Also the owner came in about 6:45 or so and thats when things got fun. His name is Pasquale and he treats everybody like they are family. He is very nice and very funny. We started to notice that everyone there were regulars. And now we can seee why. I dont care what you say customer service is very important and it will keep people comming back. For dinner everyone tried something different so we could all try everything. I ordered the stuffed tortellini. It was stuffed with chicken, ricota cheese and in a tomato cream sauce. This sauce was friggin awesome. The linguini with clams in a  white sauce was delish. The meetballs, sausage & peppers was great and the stuffed peppers were to die for. My mom got the Chicken Parmigiana it was huge and it was great and very moist inside.   All the desserts are made fresh by Pasquale's wife. We tried the chocolate cake, tiramisu, and the cannoli. All the desserts were so good and you knew they were fresh. This place is a great little place and you will feel at home. Its small inside and not fancy at all, they except cash only and it is a BYOB restaurant. Great food and even better prices. If you meet Pasquale ask about his special apron, but only if your not easily offended. lol

Dont waist your time!  We got here at 6:30 on sat night for a friends birthday. When we sat down we ordered a beer each and everyone wanted to do a shot so we all did one. We at that point we ordered chips and queso dip. 45 min later we ask about the queso and the waitress said she will check on it. She comes back out the kitchen and says they are making it now. WTF this is chips from a bag and some cheese dip the put in a microwave. Unreal. 10 min later our chips and queso show up. Everytime we ordered a beer it took 15-20 min to get. No joke. Its because they have one person bartending on a saturday night. Not sure why, but the place was only about a third full but she was backed up and the manager was not helping. At about 8:30 a few more people show up and we got another shot and now my third beer in two hours. When the waitress brings the drinks she tells us the manager says we cant order anymore drinks for 30 45 min. I said why not. She says the manager says we cant serve you anymore shots cause there is a limit to how much we can serve you in a certain amount of time. I said you have got to be kiddding me. On my third beer and two little girl foo foo shots and we are cut off, one hour for queso dip , you are f$#kin kidding me. I said check please we are out of here. We were not being loud or causing in attention to us for any reason. It was the most melow I have seen a grpup of 10 be at a bar. A few people went outside to smoke every once in a while and each end of the table had there own conversation going on.The worst service, I have never seen this before. I have been drinkin at the bars for a while and I have to say 3 12oz bottel beers and 2 shots in 2 and a half hours on a sat night is a slow start at the bar. This place is horrible. If I could give them 0 stars or negative stars I would! Im sorry I guess Im the only one going to the bar on a sat night to get a littel drunk.

This is the original ah so and this should be the only one cause the others dont compare. Everyone here is so nice almost to nice if thats possible. I have been going here for years and I have been here three times in the last month. I always sit at the teppan table and get filet and shrimp and order a sushi roll. Everytime I go I create my own roll and just tell them what I want in it and they always make it just the way I was seeing it or even better. The miso soup here has beef broth in it. Its so good. It seems like most places are just chicken stock miso. All the teppan chefs are great and do all the teppan table tricks as usual like the volcano onion and flick a shrimp in your mouth with there spachula. They have $5 saki bombers for happy hour and always have some kind of special going on like special sushi rolls and entrees. They have a pound in the middle of the dinning area with small koi fish in it. I have never had a bad meal here ever.

I happen to really like this place for breakfeast. I have been going to this location  and the other location for years and always happy with my meal. I used to get the Bubbas Benny which is biscuits and gravy with eggs and potatoes. But now they make it with turkey sausage so I dont get it anymore. Now I get the eggs benidict. Its good and the hollandaise sauce doesnt have a lot of lemon in it. Im not a fan of lots of lemon in my hollandaise. The waffles and french toast here are good as well. This place has burgers, salads, and sandwiches to. Prices are good. $5-10. I dont think they have anything over $10 on the menu.

My folks went here when they were kids and they took me here all my life to. The ice cream is great. They have been in the vally since 1952, I believe and they had two other locations. The location they are in now is the newest one and the other two are no longer in buisness. They have lots of different toppings and ice cream combinations. The also have two huge ice cream platters. The Hill and the Mountain. The hill is 6 lbs of ice cream and the mountain is 8 lbs of ice cream. You pic the kinds of ice cream you want and the topping. Both are huge and both I have conqured. I went here for a few birthday partys when I was a kid and took them both down. Yeah yeah! Anyway the also have a few food items. The Coyl club is awsome. I get it on marble rye and it comes with ham, turkey, lettus, tomato, and cheese. Its a tripple decker and I get the potato salad wich is delicious to. They have a killer BLT which has 12 pices of bacon on it. OMG it so good. I have to say the food prices are good but the ice cream althou it is freakin delicious  it is a little pricey. I go here cause I grew up going here and I do love it so Ill pay the high price for the ice cream, I know i wont be disapointed.

I have to say this place is so so good. They don't have a sign with the name of there buisness outside of the place and its freakin ugly on the ouside and next to a porn shop and a circle K, but of my god  they have good food. The pizza is great, good crust (NY style), good sauce and good toppings. The wings are great and they are huge. The sandwiches are the same way huge and delicious. Dont let the location or the outside fool you. Inside not much to talk about but just try it you will be happy! This place has been here for over 25 years.

Barrows is so good. I feel its the best chain pizza joint in town. Lunch specials kick ass. Two huge slices and a drink $4 out the door. Great salad and sandwiches for $5 as well. The pizza sauce is so good. I did work here when I was a teenager so I know they make the dough and the sauce in house everyday. I hope Barros takes over all those other horrible pizza places ( dominos, papa johns, pizza hut). I still have know idea how those places are open. I dont know anyone who eat that crap. They have crap pizza and high prices, but not Barros. This place rocks. If you like cheese then get the extra large, it has over a pound of cheese, im more of a sauce person. Oh yeah they have wings to. UM UM

I have been here a few times in the past and I was not a huge fan. They have huge portions but i didn't think anything had much flavor really. I have changed my mind about this place for sure. The Cesar salad and potato soup were good. I had the Chicken Fried Steak and it was great. The steak was tender and crispy, the country gravy on top was delicious. This took me by sup rise. I will say the green beans were over cooked, and had just been sitting for a while cause they were wrinkled and cold. My girlfriend got the prime rib and she liked it but it was fatty for sure. Her grandma got the Norwegian Salmon and she loved it. Salmon was cooked perfectly. The kiddo got the pizza and she loved it. We went on mothers day and everyone from the hostess to the servers were very attentive. We had a great lunch and were very happy. This place was on there game for mothers day for sure!

This place is great! Cheap beer and great food. The wings are huge and so good, and chaeper than any place in the valley. I have had many things on the menue and I would get all of it again. The little cutie cooking & wait staff are so friendly and have all been there for a long time. They are so much fun. It gets packed for happy hour so get there early. The only thing I would want here is more seats at the bar but there are lots of booths. Love this place I go here at least once or twice a week.

I just have to say again this place has the best wings in town Nobody gets them as crispy as they do. The sauce is your average wing sauce, its good not fancy with mild,. med, and hot but its not about the sauce its about the wing. I never dip my wings in ranch or blue cheese. The ranch is for the carrots or celery in my opinion.  God dam I find myself craving them at least once a week. The other thing I like here is the Chicken Philly. Freakin awesome. This place also has the cheapest beer ever. Love this place. The wait staff here are great and very friendly. Its funny cause I have been going here a while and everyone working here loves me but there is one lady that works here that likes me but hates me cause everytime I go in there I play some heavy metal on the juke box. I play the music cause welI I love heavy metal but also because she cant stand it when I play it. I get all the other waitresess to sing with me and she gets so upset and just rolls her eyes. I love it! lol

I have lived next to this place for  just bout my whole life and I had never been here. My folks went last night and I hapen to try some of the left overs. I liked it so much me and my girlfriend went today for lunch.   All lunch specials come with soup, egg roll, and choice of white or fried rice. She was very happpy wit the egg drop soup but did need pepper and a touch of salt.. It had pieces of chicken, corn, eas, and onion in it. I totall like it myself and wanted a second bowl. She ordered the sweet & sour chicken. It was tempura battered the chicken and it was so crispy and the sauce was excellent. I ordered the same dish my folks got the night before which was Avacado chicken. Chicken, avacado, broccolini, bean sprouts, and a very delicious brown sauce. I was not expecting the food here to be as good as it was but if they have been in buisiness as long as they have they must b doing  something right. Ill be back , my dish was a dinner dish and it was $8.95 and the GF dish was a lunch special for $6.50. Cant beat that.

This place has been here forever. I always like going here cause the collection of miscellaneous stuff he has inside hanging on the walls and celling are always great to look at. My favorite is the Ronald McDonald hanging from the celling by a noose. lol you just have to go here to see it cause every time you go you will see something new that you did not see the last time. On to the food, they have a good cheap sandwich here. They have many sandwiches on the menu and they good prices. I think they are one of the cheapest places in town for sandwiches. They have a special for a 7in ham and cheese with a small soda for $3. This place gets very busy at lunch and seating is limited. Fun place to go and it doesn't hurt the wallet.

The kiddo wanted to go here for some pizza and games so we went. I have to say this new location is nice inside. The arcade at the old location was bigger. I used to love peter piper pizza when I was a kid. I think it was the cornmeal on the bottom, gave it that crunch. I was disappointed that our pizza didn't have that this time. The boneless wings were good and the pizza was OK, but the kiddo had a great time winning tickets to get a toy at the counter and she ate all her pizza. So mission accomplished. All about the kiddo!!! She's happy and were happy. When we were leaving there was a large group of thug like teenagers and there little group of girls and the were intentionally getting in our way and making it difficult to get out the door and get to our car. I forgot i was at Ghetto-Center. One kid had his pants on to his knees then two other pairs of shorts above that then his boxers sticking out above that. lol There is no way he looks in the mirror and says I look good. Anyway fun for the kid but I don't like the Ghetto-Center area so probably wont be taking the kiddo back there again.

This Checker is the best. I had a battery running low and needed to get a new one. I went here today and had them test it. We found the charge was low and the battery could be replaced. So I got a new battery and they went ahead and insatlled it. I know its easy to replace a battery I have replaced many but they did it for free. And when he was changing it we noticed that the cable end was cracked and he replaced that as well NO CHARGE. This place is great. I could have done all this myself but it was so nice to pull up and leave with the problem fixed at no charge. If I would have been at any auto store with a service center this probly would have costed more than the battery itself. I thanked the guy and gave him 10 bucks just for helpin me out. I will go to this location for everyone of my automotive needs . Thanks Checker

I have not had lunch here nor have I had the cake here but what I did have was the eclairs. Eclairs are my favorite. These are the best and they are so big its unreal. The chocolate is really thick on top and they are overloaded with filling. These don't have you typical custard filling its more whip cream like actually. Normally I would have a problem with that cause I love the custard filling but this filling is really good. These eclair's are crisp just on the outside and nice and soft in the middle. They don't fall apart like other eclairs in fact mine stayed together till the very last bite. The eclairs are abut $3.50 each. I also have tried some of the cookies they have and all were good. They also make sandwiches, fresh bread, cakes, and other pastries.

Oh yeah this place is so good! The italian guys who run this place are way cool and they will totally remember you after a few visits. I order my pizza well done and when I get there to pick up the pizza they always make sure it looks just the way I want it. Great Crust! The wings are great and the pizza is even better. Its hard to believe that people order crap like Pizza Hut, Dominos, and Papa Johns when you can get Good pizza at Napoli for the same price or cheaper. Whatever. Great lunch specials and the sandwiches are great to. I feel like im in a pizza joint in New York when I go here.

I have been bowling here since I was a kid. My best friend and I played on leagues form the ages of 7 till about 11. They have not done a whole lot to this place since they opened in early 80's. They put in flat screen score boards but thats aboout it oh yeah the ugly paint they put on the wall above the lanes. The ball returns are so old and beat to hell that a few of them have broken pieces on them and it scrathced my ball really bad. The bar service here sucks ever since Jenn left. It takes forever to get a drink now. My friend and I started going on thursday nights cause they had a great deal $1.50 games from 9 till close. But they now stoped that deal and ints now $5 per game. I wish there would be a new kind of bowling alley that would open up somewhere and make it cool and up t date equipment. Bowling is fun but they all are so dull and blah inside. Anyway this place needs to update some things and get some good bar tenders here, and some cheap bowling night would be cool again to. The funny thing is ever since that $1.50 game deal went away now they have nobody bowling after nine. lol They would have cheap games but they made money on food and at the bar when they had cheap games. Now there making no money from 9 till midnight. BRING BACK THE $1.50 GAMES PLEASE!

I have been going to this deli for many years. It has changed locations and chaged owners but its never lost anything along the way. I would say its got better as the years have gone on. By far the best bread in town baked in house everyday. Every party or  get-together i have or go to I will always stop here and grad some bread. They have Boars Head meats which is the best great Italian sausage that comes in from Chicago. They have great lunch specials. They have take home pizza kits. They include the dough, cheese, sauce, and peperoni. They are good! Check this place out if your in the area. The bread is worth going out of your way to get.

I love pei wei. I eat at one of the locations around the valley at least once a week. They have the best Orange Chicken ever. The Crab Puffs are great and if you like something spicy then get the Blazzin Noodles or the Thi Dynamite. The Lo Mein Bowl is delicious as well. I would rather go here than many other asian restaurants in town really.  All dishes can be prepaired with chicken, beef, or shrimp then choose white rice, brown , or you can get fried rice. I have been here many times and never had a bad meal. The prices are great and the amount of food you get is good. They have a few apps including lettuce wraps, edamame, crab puffs, dumplings and other great things.  They also serve bottled beer.

Best Baked Potato Soup ever! I went here last night with the GF and my folks. Everybody really liked what they had. The GF got prime rib. I have never seen a piece of Prime Rib so thick. It was good. Mom got the Chicken Piccata. Two chicken breast artichoke hearts, asparagus, lemon, and capers. She loved it. Dad got the Rib & Chicken combo. This plate is amazing. The ribs were good and had some of the best BBQ sauce I have ever had. The chicken that comes with it is huge and really really good and you get two pieces. This meal could easly be split by two people. Im so going back for this meal. I got the special of the night which was Rainbow Trout Blackened and served with rice, veggies, and salad which I subed for soup. This fish was great and again a huge portion. It was a whole fish. For dessert we got the Bread Pudding. This is THE BEST BREAD PUDDING I Have EVER HAD. My dad is a bread pudding connoisseur and it is the best he has ever had. The presentation was great and the taste even better.   So overall everyone very happy, very full cause they do not short you on food here. I will be back for that rib & chicken combo and of course the bread pudding. Its just that good. Service was great. The wait on a Friday night at 7 pm was only ten min. The prices range from $15-25 for entrees. The rib and chicken combo was only $18. So worth it. The atmosphere is comfortable and warm.

This year we decided to have an Italian dinner for Christmas with the family instead of the usual ham, prime rib etc... For me italian food is always a good choice. We went ot Defalco's for italian sausage. I got the sweet and hot italian sausages but i tried something I never had from there, it was the sausage with garlic and cheese. YUM this stuff is delicious and I will be getting it often. I grilled it which is wierd cause I usually cook it up in a pan with olive oil and peppers & onions but this stuff was so good it did not need all that.  I have been going here for years and everything is delicious. The sandwiches are great, pizza is good, and they sell wine. I love this place. If you go for lunch be prepaird they get busy.

I really like this place. This place is a good place to come watch a game or UFC or just for getting some food. They have tv's everywhere and the bar is inside and goes outside for those of you who would like to enjoy a smoke at the bar like the good  ol days you can do that here. They have the game Bags set up for anyone to play. Thay also have a ping pong table, pool table, and they even have a breathalizer in the hallway to the restrooms so you can make sure your ok to drive. Its cool and funny cause Arizona is a 0 tollerance state so you can blow a .02 and be busted even thou the limit is .08. I know someone who was busted for blowing .02. Anyway they have a huge patio with the firepits for the cooler weather and great drink specials. I had the philly cheese steak and loved it. They also have a good chicken philly. Cream cheese jalopeno poppers and wings are good to. Check it out!

My girlfriend and I had dinner here the last time thru the Venetian. The menu had so many good things it took me forever to figure out what I wanted but i defiantly made the right choice. I had the braised rib ravioli. The meat inside was so tender and juicy, the ravioli was made with fresh pasta and the sauce was unreal. I could have put it in a cup and drank it with a straw it was so good. Unfortunately my girlfriend did not get the right thing. She was in the mood for linguine and clams and when it came out she tried one bite and said she did not like it. I reached over to give it a try and all I could smell was olive oil. It had no flavor except olive oil and we sent it back. I still give this place 4 stars cause the service and the ravioli and bread and salad was all great, oh and the wine. So many great places to eat in Vegas, I'm glade I made it here.

I went to eat at Sapporo and  absolutly loved it. When we got there we learned that they were having happy hour and that made me very happy! Not to many places have sunday happy hour, i will be back because of that alone.   We started off with the Tampura shrimp roll and the Las Vegas roll. After that our  teppanyaki chef came out. He was very funny. He did all the same stuff you see them do at the teppan tables but he was fun to chat with. We ordered the filet and shrimp and it came with soup and salad. The salad dressing was so good and I want some to take home. lol The soup at these places are usually all the same but I seemed to enjoy it more here. I feel sometimes it can be watered down a little but not here. The filet was cooked just perfectly for me. (med rare). The shrimp was great and the rice was delicious. It all had great flavor and did not need a sauce but i did dip a piece of shrimp in the ginger sauce they serve and after that i dipped everything in the sauce. The steak, shrimp, and the veggies. That sauce would make anything taste good. Our waitress was nice and very knowlegable about the menue. Our food came out quickly and all was good. I like the ambiance it was not to dark  just right for me. The staff was nice and the food was great.  Ill be back for sure and especialy for happy hour. Most of the rolls were $10-$12 a few at $14 but during happy hour all are half off. Cant beat that! The next day I did hear they failed there health  inspection a month ago with a 6 and then again a week later with a 9. Not to good at all. I hope they have taken care of all the problems but for me it was a great experience and no problems with the food at all.

I have stayed in so many hotels in vegas and by far for the money you will not find a better hotel room for $220 on a Saturday night. This room was a one bedroom with two flat screens, a 19inch tv in the restroom, a mini bar a restroom big enough for 20 people, shower and deep tub and  even a second restroom. You could have your own party here and could sleep 4-5 if you had to. Its always a speedy check in and out even when there is a line with 15-20 people. This is the only room I have stayed in for under $250 per night and I actually felt like I was in a fancy upscale suite. These are really cool rooms.

This place has been added to my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Very friendly and accommodating staff. I like everything from the look, to the feel, especially the food, and of course the smell of this place. Between everyone in the party we had half the dam menu on the table so we all shared a little so we could all try everything. On the menu itself they have lots of great dishes but I will tell you its all about the short rib meat or short rib taco platter. These short ribs are unreal, and definitely there go to item on the menu. You get a huge portion of meat! So smokey and freakin yum, that's all I can say. The special of the night is what I got. Halibut with a vanilla butter sauce and potato fennel puree. The sauce was so good. I noticed myself saying yum out-loud after every bite. Totally comin back soon. This place does breakfast and I will be checking it out. Two things I did not like. First the parking lot is small and 25% is self parking and 75% of it is what they call free valet, which is bull shit. Now if you don't want to walk to the parking garage under the building next to the restaurant you now have to tip a guy that gets your car that is no more then 50 feet away. I feel insulted and taking advantage of when I have to pay to park when I have to pay for the food that brought me here. I don't have to tip these valet guys is what the host tells me. I'm not that asshole but i wanted to be. The second thing was the dessert menu was limited and nothing stands out. So we passed and went elsewhere for that. So next time I cruz by and there is a open space in the free parking area I will dip in for some good eats!!!

I love this place. The caramelized onion and sausage pizza is so good! The pasta and salad is good to. I usually order pizza and a pasta or salad dish and take home what I dont eat. Small place but nice and food comes out really quick. I want to say more about this place cause my review seems small but its simply good eats. Check it out

So we went here for lunch and was happpy,. I did not even expect to eat here but we saw it on the way to another place and decided to try it out. The inside is a cozy new Mexico western kinda feel to it. We had the pork dish we had is unreal. Smoked pork, rice and beans, and a couple tortillas. This dish made this a 4 star review rather than a 3 star. The girlfriend and I decided to split that and a sandwich. We tried the turkey sandwich and it was just OK, came with fries. On the turkey sandwich it came with pablano peppers which sounded good but it was one really big pepper and it was to thick for the sandwich. Mabey if they cut it into smaller pieces we would have liked it better. The waitstaff and host were very friendly and the prices are good. Lunch specials for as cheap as $10 and somethings ranging in the $20 area. I want to come here for happy hour, and that pork dish. This place is worth a try for sure!

Great cheesesteaks sandwich. I always love a cheesesteak but I hate getting fatty meat so I'm picky about where I get them, not one bit of fat in my sandwich here. Oh yeah,  I love the wiz on my philly. My girlfriend got two slices of pizza and loved it.  After 4 pm the have a large cheese pizza for 8.99. We got one a few days later and we got it well done and it was delicious. The staff is nice a friendly and pointed me in the right direction after asking a few ?'s. They deliver but of course Im a about a mile out of range but I thought I would mention it. Ill be back.

I was suprised at how much is on the menu. I was just expecting pita wraps and that is not the case. They have a pasta dish and hummus and all sorts of good stuff. I ordered the hot Philly Steak pita with onions and green peppers  for $6.95. It was so good and i cant wait to go back to get it again.. I always worry about getting philly steak sandwiches cause I love them but some places dont trim the meat real well and you get lots of fat on the meat. Not this place, no fat on this pita. My friend got the California Club cold pita which was $7.95. It was  huge and she had to take half of it home. It came with a side of cucumber sauce. That sauce is delicious. I love this place and cant wait to try some of the other items on the menu. The best part was I left saticfied and perfectly full. We were quick to be seated and the food came out quick as well.

Oh my god this place is good. Pulled pork, beef brisket, and oh yeah the Q-rools are all to die for. I would recommend anything on the menu cause I have tried it all. The smoasted chicken is unreal! For me I wont go anywhere else for BBQ except my own house.  The atmosphere is great and its a little dark &  there is a outside patio area as well. They have great lunch specials. The food portions are good size you will probably be taking some home.  And when your done and pay they bring you a little bag of the best little doughnuts ever.  Oh yeah Doughnuts.

I would say this place is similar to Chipolte. My work is close so i checked it out for lunch. I had the puled pork burrito and it was so good. I was not expecting it to be as good as it was. It had pulled pork, grilled red onion & green peppers, rice, pinto beans, sour cream, and hot sauce. These burritos are big enough to eat half and save half for later or split with someone but I ended up eating every single bit of that thing. They have salads and tacos as well. Check it out!!!

I used to go here back when I was a kid cause my grandparents lived about two miles from here my whole childhood. Way cheap, $6.50 for adults and children are $3.50 and you can watch two movies. Just tune to a radio station and listen to the movie in your car. Its nice cause you can bring your own food and drink and not pay the ridiculous amounts of money at the snack stand. A bucket of popcorn is $5.50 and you get free refills but if you need a refill after this bucket then you da man cause there buckets feed a family of ten. Its Huge! We went with a group of people so we sat outside our cars with the doors open so we could hear the movie. The only problem was the flight path for sky harbor airport is just south of the theater and if your outside then all you hear is the plains overhead unless you have a really loud stereo system. Overall we had a great time and we will do it again.

I have been wanting to go here for a while and today I finally did and very happy. Unreal what all they have. Not just  eggs and pancakes. They have fruit crepes, 6 kinds of french toast including bannana nut bread french toast (YUM), egg scrambles, belgin waffels, and more. I had the biscuts and gravy which was good. The breakfast sausage you can get patties or links. Of course I got links and my god they were like 3 inches long and a 1 inch thick. They have thick cut bacon that was actually crispy not soggy and limp. The eggs benidict was freggin awesome! I will be back for this for sho. This place does breakfast realy good, but they are open till 3pm and they do lunch as well. I went there at 11am on a wed and there was a 15 min wait. I was suprised there was a wait that late in the morning but now I know why. This place rocks! Service was great. Everyone workin there was friendly and in good spirits. I cant wait to go back.

My girlfriend and I decided to go here with her daughter a few weekends ago and I was disappointed. I used to go here quite a bit when I was a kid, now 30 years later and this place could really use some updating and a cleaning. We had a good time riding the train and walking around, but that's about it. We wanted to do the paddle boats but the water in the pound looks toxic. I would stay far away from the water here! All the rides were just old looking. The park was very busy that day and the trash cans were overflowing and it just looked rough. To many other new and cleaner parks to go to, don't think Ill ever go back. See Ya Encanto!!!

This place is good. The margaritas are very strong. They have a patio with a fire going. I have been here two times and both times were good. If you go here and the special  of the day is the halibut with red pepper sauce, get it if its not the special ask if they can make it for you! This halibut dish is awsome! The second time i went i was not real hungry so i got the Bondera Platter. Its a lot more food then I was expecting. Its $13 and you get two small soft corn tacos with pork, half a chicken quesadilla, two shrimp, two pieces of grilled beef, two stuffed jalapenos, grilled veggies, quacomole, and queso dip. Lots of food for the money. The quacomole is so good, not much to it but its just so fresh. The service is ok and the decor is nice, a little on the dark side and they have big booths that will seat six. They have a good size bar and a few bar tables right indise the door.  Nice place, good food, fair prices.

We Finlay made it to St Francis. My girlfriend and I came here for dinner New Years eve for dinner before heading to a party. We both went with the 3 course meal that night. She got the salad that had thinly slice grapefruit and a light but tasty vinaigrette. I choose the lobster bisque. This lobster bisque was so good except one thing, they put thinly sliced pecans in it. This is not a place for nuts. I had a few bites of it before I got the pecans and it was delicious. Once i chewed the nuts it coated my mouth and that was all I could taste for the rest of the bowl. Leave the nuts out next time it was so good!!! Course #2 She got the scallops. Freakin awsome and cooked to perfection! I have never had a scallop cook so perfect ever. Props to who ever was cooking the scallops that night! I ordered the fillet. I ordered it med rare and it was more like med+ and I took one bite and decided to keep it cause it was delicious and they were busy and didn't want to wait 15 min for another. I usually would have sent it back but the flavor was there and the veggies that came with were excellent. For the desserts she got pear dessert with ice cream. Freakin awsome. Great thing to have for cleansing the palate after all that great food. I got the Chocolate turtle dessert that was great but we took that home for later. The building is cool and for the firs timers the waiter gives you a little history about the building before ordering. Great service and great food. We will be back and cant wait to see whats on the menu next time we stop by!

Yep this place is great!!! The menu is great, so many dishes i want to try. I have been for lunch and had the club sandwich which was very good. The mac n cheese is really good. I ordered it with crab the first time and had it plain the second time. You can add lobster, crab, chicken, but plain is how i liked it best. We ordered the shrimp app. It was delicious. The shrimp was done in a citrus marinade and served with a small salad and topped with avocado. Now to the reason I'm writing this review, the Chicken Pot Pie. Oh yeah, this version of pot pie had me worried cause its served open face and that's a problem cause I love the crust on top and was worried I would not like it. But with a little help for the server I went for it. I posted a pic. It was so good and I would not want it any other way now. It just works for me. This was the last thing I was going to order and now I know I'm going to have a hard time ordering next time cause I know how good this dish is. I really like this place, from the service to the decor and especially the menu. I cant wait to go back!!!

Kick ass store. I could go camping in that store and be happpy. Lots of great things and really good prices on most everything in the store. I like the bins they have in the isles. You kind find really cool stuff for cheap in those bins. I like how you can climb up in the boats and check them out. The fude is good try the rocky road. The restaurant in side is cool with a huge fish tank, bigger than the tank in the store. I have eatin there in the past its ok. All the Bass Pro shops are built to match the enviornment. Everything inside you would find in Az. I have been to the Vegas Bass Pro shops to and its very simular but the celling in the fishig department there is so cool. Anyway its a one stop shop for all you outdoor activities from golf, fishing, hunting camping, cooking, clothes, boating, quads, fun bbq sauces and salsas, furniture, wind chimes, and so much more.

Ok dont believe the hype! After reading all the reviews and seeing this place on Dinners, Drive ins & Dives I was very excited to eat here. Well VERY DISAPOINTING! What is Italian about pita bread? Everyone knows pizza is based off its crust and this was not crispy even thou it was burnt. If I folded it in half it would have been a gyro. No pizza sauce and tasteless toppings. I just dont believe how people love this place, but then again Dominos is still in buisness. I guess its personal prefrence. I would have been more happy with a totinos for $1 or a microwave pizza. The pasta dish we got we felt the same way about, tasteless and just a few veggies and a few  pieses of chicken and agian no flavor. Well I think Guy was wrong about this one. If you want good pizza worth going out for its all about Pizza Bianco or Grimaldis.

This place is right by my folks house and I have been here many times. Great happy hour spot to. I have had so many things on this menu its rediculous. They have deep fried aligator app that is so good. Inside they have a lobster tank with for sure the biggest lobsters I have ever seen. Today I went for lunch and got the Crispy Halibut sanwich and fries. They gave me shoestring fries, if you get fries make sure you get the regular fries cause shoe string fries look cute but they are just annoying. The sandwich was so good, and it was a big piece of halibut for $12.95. My girlfriend got the wood fired talapia with greenbeans, shrimp, and veggy. It was so good and the lunch price $13.95. She usually gets the crab legs and like i said, so many good things i get something different everytime. Nice big bar with a few boths and the dinning area is huge. This place can get busy at night and especialy on the weekends but its worth the wait if you have to.

I had some of the best Italian food I have ever had outside of my house here at Aiello's. I went with a party of 6 for my mom's Bday. Everyone got something different and we all sampled each others dish. We started with the Mozzarella Carozza. which is Mozzarella on semololina bread then dipped in egg then sauteed in a wine , anchovie and caper sauce. This could have been my meal it was so good. We also got a Caprese and it was great and we got Calamari and it was ok, good but I have had better.   For the main course I had the Spagheti alla Puttanecsa, which is a spicy tomato sauce with capers,shallots, olives( black and green), anchovies, garlic and fresh herbs. I also got a side of there awsome meat balls. These meatballs are huge and the are made with veal and pork. They are so good and soft and full of flavor. Best meatballs I have had outside my house for sure. They claim they were voted best in New York. Some of the other courses our table got was Linguine Gameberoni = linguine with shrimps with a garlic aglio olio, Cavatelli with Sunday gravy, tomato sauce with with sausage and a meatball, and Orechiette with Broccoli Di Rape & Civilate which is pork sausage stuffed with cheese parsley and sauteed in a rapini agioli olio. This sausage was so dam good. The sausage is amazing.  All the food was so good  the service was outstanding and the owner visited our table 4 times. This is cool cause it shows they care about the customers and the quality of the food being served to your table.  The owner and all the staff are great people and took care of us well. I will be back for sure. Good italian food done right by real Italians. You will not be disapointed if you go here. Go to the Aiello page on yelp and go to the link that goes to the restaurant's web site to check out the menu. The Tirimisu is delicious and so is the chilled zabaglione which is a marsala custard with fresh strawberries and sweet cream, Oh yeah! All around good from apps to entrees to dessert to the two bottles of wine. I cant wait to go back. One last thing, when you done and before they bring the check the bring out this shaker thing bthet had numbers in it. They ask you nto pick a number between 1 and 90. The table picks one number and if it comes up the the whole bill is free and if your party is bigger then 4 then 4 entrees are paid  for by them. This is so cool. Our number was not picked but my brothers number was picked the first two time he ate here. Just a really cool place, good food , great staff and the atmosphere is nice white table clothes with a  open dinning room with a bar  and they have a little patio as well.

I heard about this place and wanted to take my girlfriend here cause I wanted to buy her a new dress. She loves vintage anything and wears vintage dresses all the time. She had picked out 5 dresses and tried them all on. Two of the dresses she said did not fit right, like they were stiched wrong but she did get two very cool dresses. I have one complaint and for me its a big one. When you walk in to this place you are expecting oldies music or mabey punk rock rockabilly music but no its fu$#ing rap crap. There is nothing more anoying then trying to shop and have to listen to very loud  bullshit RNB and rap music. The hispanic girl running the store was very bitchy and i was very close to picking up the radio and tosssing it on to Glendale ave so it could be ran over and destroyed. My god I wanted to tell her but by the looks of things she could care less who she was affending. Even my girlfriend said i  would like to come back and look at dresses but wont cause of the music and the horrable attitude on the women that was runnin the store at the time. The rap music was so loud and anoying it totally took away from being a cool little vintage shop. I guess thats what they listen to in that shit hole part of town they are in. I hate Glendale and I will never like it.

This place is no big deal. I think if you want a change from fast food and want some quick BBq then this place might make you happy. If your hopping to find a great little BBq place that yoiu just cant wait to go back to forget it. Prices are not bad and they do have free ice cream which is always good in my book. I had acombo meal for $8.50. I chose pulled pork and beef brisket on my sanwich. The brisket was tender but no flavor and dry. The pulled pork was really dried out so you needed lots of bbq sauce. I did get two sides with this I got the mac n cheese. This was watery, cheese needed to be thicker. The waffel fries were ok but could have been cooked a little longer so they were crispy. Mabey it was a bad night that I stoped by but i dont think ill be commin back here.

This is my favorite place to eat breakfast in Az. and its because of the menu. This place does not have just eggs and bacon with toast. All the dishes  are jacked up like jalapeno hollandaise for the eggs Benedict and my fave is the country fried steak covered in there country gravy and then topped with green chile pork and then two eggs and multi color potatoes for the side. I posted a pic of this dish! It is even better then it sounds if that's possible. This place is a little bit of a drive for me but so worth it. The service is great and its like a family place. They treated us like regulars since the first time we went. They also have a really cool 57 Chevy inside that has been converted into a booth. I like breakfast but I don't want to go unless its extra special and this place is it for me.

Where to start.  This place kicks so much ass! It has everything. Way better then BevMo. If your looking for a cheap price on a quanity of beer this is your place for sure. Everything is cheaper than if it was on sale at a grocery store. Big and small bottles of hard alcohol, beer, kegs, soda, mixers, wine,  hard to find unique bottels of wine all the gadgets you could ever think of. They have an aisle that has many assorted beers that you can create your own six pac or just buy one beer. I have tried so many beers from here I would have never known about.  All the people working there are knowledgeable and very friendly. I dont think Ill buy from anywhere else.

I just want to tell about my experience here this is not a place I would normally go cause I eat food cause I like the flavor not cause its healthy. I can appreciate the idea behind this place but holy shit this place is over priced for what you get. Everything needed salt and I kind of expected that. I will say that the pizza we tried was good. We tried the shrimp, roasted red peppers, and goat cheese pizza and it was suprisingly good. I did not think I would care for shrimp on a pizza but dam it, it was a good combo for sure. I also got the turkey pita. It had a great dresing on it just did not have enough of it. The pita bread was so dry i drank two glasses of water just to get it down.  When you eat this you know your eating healty so its just blah. They use all local products which  I like and the menue changes with the season wich I like but everything we tried was lacking flavor . I went with 6 people and everybody shared so we could all try everything. Betweeen all of us we tried 6 different dishes and two apps. They have an outside patio and the inside decor is nice. We got the private table in the back wich was cool. The restrooms sinks are very cool and they have the best hand driers ever in the restrooms as well, not really important just thought I would mention that. Anyways If your a healthy eater than this place is worth a try. For me if I'm going to spend $15-20 for myself I would choose so many other places.

I often eat at many of the filbertos in the valley but we all know that some are good and some are bad. This one is good along with the one on 19th ave and Thunderbird and 19th ave and Bell Rd. But i was  at a bar  in this area of town over the weekend and this place made up one of the best breakfast burritos I have ever had.  God dam, ill be back when Im in the area. Thanks Bertos!

I love this place. My favorite thing about this is that whatever concoction you come up with they will make a smoothie out of it. I love this cause that way I can have a treat while on the run and not have to sit and eat it. My concoction was pomegranate yogurt i topped it with fresh raspberries, blueberries , and small oranges, then they took it in the back and blended that mix up for me and I was off and very happy! Here you get a cup fill it and they charge you by the weight. I like this concept to. Good yogurt lots of toppings and you can make it a smoothie if you would like.

So this place has the best sushi in Phoenix hands down. They have some exotic rolls on the menu, and this place makes a big roll. I had the surf & turf roll and it was Freakin YUM! Surf & Turf roll has tempura shrimp, crab salad mix, cucumber, asparagus, and topped with lightly seared beef. This roll has the most flavor in roll I have ever had, it was smokey and delicious. Also it has a sauce on the plate which I think is simply mayo and sriracha sauce. I love sriracha sauce. The lunch special for $9 is a great deal. Comes with soup salad a roll or small entree. Inside it is very plain. Customers can create there own roll and if its good they will put it on the wall. We also got the tempura veggies, very good. Its hard to mess that up, you could put tempura on anything and it would be good. This place is kinda hidden back off the main street in a little business area. Not a place with atmosphere but a place with excellent sushi! Im so happy I live so close to this place I will be here often. They have happy hour specials everyday including weekends. At lunch the rolls are sold ( not the exotic rolls) at happy hour prices as well. GO HERE, you will not be disapointed at all. Huge rolls, good HH prices, and the for me the best sushi I have had.

Another great meal at Akaihana. This time I had the Golden Gate Bridge roll (see pic). This was delicious. Its tempura shrimp with cream cheese, scallions, a spicy mix I cant remember the name of, and then topped with yellow tail a slice of jalapeno, and sriracha sauce. Its soooo good. I know some people dont like cream cheese in there rolls I happen to like it a lot, but there are some of the best exotic rolls on the menu I have ever seen. Also I tried the jalapeno poppers to. Not your average poppper but realy good. They came with a smokey sauce and were good for $3.50. HH prices at lunch.  Check this place out! Killer bannana dessert!!!

I have been to 4 of the Ah-so restaurants in town and I have never seen one with all the NFL helmets on display. Just seems wierd to have the helmets on display at an Asian sushi restaurant, it doesnt fit, anyway I always sit at the teppin table and get steak and shrimp and I should have stuck to that routine. This time I was in the mood for sushi and so I ordered the shrimp tampura roll and a spicy tuna roll. The shrimp roll was ok not my favorite. The spicy tuna roll was no good at all. The tuna was bad and should have never been served.. This has to be the worst roll I have ever had. I wanted a roll with crab and they do not have real crab at all. I dont mind paying extrea for it but to not have it at all is BS. My friend had the Egg Noddle with shrimp bowl. The bowl they serve it in is rediculous. It is huge and just annoying to eat out of. My friend took just a few bites and sent it back.  It took about 15 min from the time I ate the tuna roll and payed the bill and got into my car. By this time my stomache was a mess and needless to say it ruined my Friday night. I spent most of it in the restroom every 15 min for a few hours. This place is no good and I will not be back.

We went here for happy hour yesterday and I will not be doing that again. Not happy with any thing we had. I got the spicy chicken tacos and the machaca pork sliders. Sliders were very dry and it took a hole beer just to wash them down. They were the smallest sliders I have ever seen. Not very tasty at all. As for the tacos, they were bite size as well. I know they are only $5 but come on now these are rediculous. I felt like someone just stole $5 from me cause the only think i could do with these tacos was complain about them. I hate when you leave a restaurant hungry. My girlfriend got the sloppy joe torta. She said it was ok but after a few bites she was not into it anymore. I do like the restaurant itself and the huge fan in the dinning room is way cool. I think if I went here again I would try a burrito off the dinner menu. They were big and they had better be cause they are $10-12. The chips and salsa were great!

So I love this place. Great prices, great tacos, great guacamole, and a very strong margarita. This place is small but so worth the wait if there is one. I had the carne taco, shrimp taco, chicken taco all great and all tacos are $2-3. My girlfriend got the huevos rancheros. Dam the sauce on this dish was so good. She loved it and ate every bit. This place is inside the Claredon hotel and the mens restroom in the lobby has urinals that are two big red lips and teeth. Freakin hilarious. Everything that came out that kitchen looked so good. I think the most expensive thing was steak n eggs for $13. Also a great place for happy hour!

When I walked in I felt like I was in a restaurant in the Venetian or Balaggio hotel. Realy nice and the host staff and waiters gave the best service you cuould possibly get. I ordered the homemade tortellini stuffed with a ricotta mixture covered in a pink vodka sauce. The dish was right on, 5 stars for this dish alone. I only wish there were a few more tortellini cause i could have eaten them till i exploded. Anyway dad got the pork chops topped with gorgonzola . He loved them. My mom and girlfriend got the steak topped with hollidaise. They both liked that but the steaks were over done a bit. They had a huge party they served before us and think our steaks were forgotten about and were a little over cooked. We told the waitress and they took both dishes off the bill and gave us free dessert. We got the dessert sampler and molten lava cake. Freakin unreal desserts. I will be back I would have given them 3 stars cause of the over cooked steaks but they made up for that in a big way and I will be back.

This place is unreal! When the pizza comes out of the oven it looks like a piece of art. Looks so good you want to devour it but then again you just want to look at it and admire it. To start off we had the cauliflower and I hesitated on getting it cause I cant stand the stuff but oh my god I love it now. Also we had the margarita pizza. Um yeah DELISH! Im going to get the Salsiccia on my next visit. And we had to try a pasta so we had the Pappardelle Bolognese. Again it was great. The pasta is made fresh in house and you can tell. We ate so much we had no room for dessert but next time I will. I have made it a point to go here once a week. I want to try everything they have on the menu. Prices are great. All that and two beers $32. Like I said this place is a must. Just look at the pics and you will see what Im talkin about. This is my new favorite place. The inside is simple and clean.  The staff are all very friendly. Our waiter was Steve. Tall guy you cany miss him. If you get him as your server you are in luck. He knows everything about all the dishes and is very helpful. Check this place out you will not be disappointed.

I made it to the parlor again today and again I was very happpy with the food and the service. The servers here are so friendly and have lots of knowledge about te menu. We made our own pizza theis time. We topped it with sausage, rock shrimp, onions, and oragano. This pie was delicious. Also we ordered the cauliflower. This place does it well cause I usually I would pass on cauliflower. They serve it in a little cream sauce topped with cheese and bread crumbs. I will get it everytime I go for sure. We also ordered the Pesto Chiatarra. Im not the biggest fan of pesto but the person I was with wanted it and so I had to try it. It has the most delicious tomatoes in it. The sauce was good, deffinetly pesto. The fresh spaghetti noodles were great. It comes with pine nuts, we got them on the side. I'm not a big fan of pine nuts but I did try them and I feel its better without them. This time I added  some pics of the food we ordered. I just love the decour of the place and always happy to be there.

Way to much money for this place. The lines for the rides move very slow. We had to stand in line for 45 min to ride something that takes 30 seconds. I will only do that once. You wont find me comin back. The lazy river is boring with no atmosphere at all. Its like being on a tube in your own pool with a current. Kids area I will say is cool. But as cool as some of the rides are it just takes way to long to to ride them. $40 to get in. We were there from 10-3 and we only were able to ride 3 rides and spend about 20 min in the wave pool and a lap around the very boring lazy river. BOO to the Wet N Wild. Being in Phoenix you would think that we of all places would have the biggest and best water parks in the country. We have the worst. What a major disappointment just like everything else in Phoenix. Its the same as it was when it was waterworld but with a few more slides. Go to Golfland Sunsplash for the best waterpark in the valley, and its half the price!!

Friday night and Im wanting to go somewhere with a cool atmosphere and some good drinks and mabey some good food. Well they had two out of three. The atmosphere is great. Love the patio with the fire pit and the bar is nice as well. I like this part of town and the restaurant fits in here well. The special drinks they have are great, I could suck them down all night,  but I was really hungry and could not wait to try the food. The food was very disapointing. Everything they serve has some crazy sause on it. I like sauces but I just feel they need a little more work on all the sauce i tried that night. The butterfish was cooked well and was great when I scraped all the sauce off of it. That fish is good and doesnt need a sauce like that. I understand the kind of food Im eating but mabey thay need to lighten  up the sauce a little. All the sauces I had seemed like they put a  mango and a pinapple in a blender and then poured it onto my food. You could not even taste the fish. It could be anything under that sauce and that would be all you taste. Then we went for the NY Steak sandwich. It comes with sauteed onions( enough onion for about 6 people) a roll that just falls apart the second you pick it up, and sliced steak that is way to thick and oh yeah one of those sauces again.  I dont mind my sanwiches being a little messsy but after two bites my sandwich looked like it was murdered and scattered all over the plate. When you took a bite everything fell out of the ass end of the roll. When I order a sandwich i dont want to assemble it after every bite nor do I want to eat my SANDWICH WITH A FORK. And again it could have been a piece of plasitic under that roll cause all i tasted was the sauce. I will say the sweet potato fries were not to bad. I dont like sweet potatos really but these were good. I did find out later that they do have regular fries but THEY DONT PUT THEM ON THE MENU, not sure why mabey cause they dont want you to be happy or they are just pushing the sweet potato fries. Whatever the reason I did not like that, cause I would have prefered regular fries.  Im there to eat and if you make it put it on the menu! Overall this place is cool and the servers are friendly, attentive, and knowlegeable about the menue     ( - the fries) but I think the Head Chef should sample all the dishes himself and think about what he is doing in that kitchen. This place could be so much better. Prime location, great atmosphere, just lacking in the food department. Im not sure if all the good reviews are from people that got sidetracked from the atmosphere or if they dont know food and thought they were eating something special or if they had to many drinks before the food. I wanted to like this place so much. I will be back for drinks and to relax by the fire pit but Im not sure i will eat here again.

We stopped here here for lunch Sunday and it was totally dead. I think there was 4 tables. This place is big with lots of seating. They have a good size stage and bands that play almost nightly. My girlfriend got the ahi tuna. The tuna was good, cooked perfectly and had a nice lemon and fresh herb taste. The veggies that came with could have been cooked just a bit more cause they were still very crunchy but they did tasted good. I ordered the chicken enchiladas with rice, beans, with a green chili sauce. The chicken enchilada was big and stuffed full of chicken. It was not rolled like your typical enchilada but it was more like a stacked enchilada. Rice was good and the beans were very light in texture. They were whipped and were very smooth. I did like the beans but they needed some salt for sure. The kido got a cheese crisp and fries. She is so funny cause she is really picky about what color the cheese is and if it is open of folded like a quesadilla. She wanted it open and with yellow cheddar. It came folded and with white cheese on it. lol She ate just the fries. When they came back they asked if we wanted them to make something else she said she was good with the fries so we said thanks but we will be ok. About 5 min later they came out with 3 small mini cheese crisps for her with yellow cheddar. lol This was so cool of the rest. This was really nice of them. Overall I liked it, I think the place has a great menu and prices are good. I want to come back and check out some music. I took a look at the happy hour menu and they have $3 wings and many other happy hour specials for $3-6. That I will be going back for!!!

This place is great. They have a great selection of chesses, oils, wine by the bottle or glass, chocolates, sauces, drinks, coffee bar, and fresh made to order pizzas and sandwices. Its about half the size of Trader Joes, but there are lots of great stuff packed into this little store. I cant wait to go back and sample some wines and grab a sandwich. The prices are = to what you would spend at Whole Foods. They have seating inside and a patio with seating as well. The weekend I was there they were sampling all sorts of chesses, crackers and salsas. Not a place I will shop at all the time but great if your looking for something special.

I like the decor, service from our waitress was good, (not so much for the table next to us) , and the menu had some great sounding dishes on it. Now for the food. Ok so THE PRETZEL WITH PROVOLONE CHEESE IS A MUST. The pretzels were a perfect golden brown with a nice crisp outside and warm and soft in the middle, and the cheese was so good. I think it was my favorite pretzel I have ever had. And I get pretzels and cheese everywhere cause I love them. I ordered the trout with green beans. The green beans were great the fish was OK. The sauce that came with the fish was a little weak in flavor otherwise it was good. The fish was cooked perfectly for sure but again little more seasoning for me. My girlfriend got the Cannelloni and butternut squash. We all shared a little bit so we could try everything and I have to say the Cannelloni was excellent. I liked it better then the fish for sure but it was equally as good to what my brother got. He ordered the pasta with short ribs in a tomato cream sauce. Meat was a little fatty but omg it was tender. The only thing bad about this is there were beans in it that were over cooked so it made the dish a little grainy. But overall the dish tasted great. We liked everything so much. I have heard a lot of good and bad things about this place but we were happy with everything and we will come back to see if they are consist ant. I say give it a try. Its weird cause they have a lot of TVs there so I'm not sure if they are trying to be a sports bar or what. Either way it was good!

Way cool museum. Its divided up in sections by country and they also have a area with some famous musicians instruments and outfits they wore. Also there is an experience room with instruments that you can play. Its a must see for any musician for sure. When you pay they give you a set of headphones. Each display has a tv with some audio of the sounds of that Instrument or it playing with a band for you to here. When you walk up to the displays it comes thru your headphones. Unreal collection of instruments here. Really a cool place to check out on a weekend. We went thru the whole place in about 2 hours.

OMG this is a great burger. Better then In -N- Out. Everything is made fresh. This burger is just the right thickness. I not a huge fan of really thick burgers so this place works for me. The burgers are juicy and they have lots of toppings you can pile on. The 1 and only complaint is this is one of those places that tries to sell you fries separate. Of course they always say - our small order is enough for 2-. This bothers me cause when I go to a fast food type place I'm usually by myself and I need fries for one not fries for 2. Now your $5 burger turns into $10 when adding a drink and fries. So unless your someone that goes here to get a burger and a burger only you will never spend just $5 here. The sad thing is all the fries they are waisting when your forcing one Person to by enough fries for 2. Aside from that the burger is great but unfortunately for $10 burgers these days i can go to so many places like fez and or grinders. This place needs a combo meal for around $7 and I would stop here more often.

Well we wont be back again. This place could be so cool but I don't really care for the menu and we have been unhappy with the food the last two times we have been and this last waitress sealed the deal for me. The waitress we had this time seem to be in la la  land. She forgot about comin back to take our dinner order after we ordered wings, she couldn't seem to finish her sentences, and really didn't seem to give a shit about us and she only had one other table. The chicken sandwich is not the same as the one I had the first time. This was a chicken breast with the fat still on it, totally untrimmed. Chicken fat in your mouth is the most disgusting thing ever. Also the bread was hard and it was not cause it was toasted to much it had dried out from sitting out un covered. Hard as a rock! They tried to tell me it was toasted but, lol, there was  no color at all, meaning not toasted, not dark, I hate being bull shitted, people make mistakes so just admit it don't bull shit me ass hole. I sent it back and did not get anything else. If these cooks here cant prep a chicken breast then who knows what else there doin back there, this is basics. My girlfriend got the grilled cheese and mac n cheese. Again bread not toasted, totally white and cheese not really melted. Um do these people know what a grilled cheese even is. Unreal. The bread was to thick for the amount of cheese. Imagine two pieces of texas thick sliced bread and one slice of cheese, lol this place is a joke. The mac and cheese is watery and no flavor. See ya Garage. If you cant make a grilled cheese, mac n cheese ,or a chicken sandwich that's even acceptable then forget it. I guess if you have a burger and wings here you may be happy that's it.

This restaurant has been added to my favorite restaurants in Phoenix for sure. The decor is upscale but open and modern at the same time. I really like it. Big bar area, all the top shelf liquor you would want. They have a raw bar with oysters, crab legs, and shrimp. The salads are big and awesome. This place has PRETZELS with PROVOLONE CHEESE for a starter.  They are perfectly golden brown little pretzel bites with melted provolone cheese. Freakin YUM!!! I have to say with a name like the Arrogant Butcher I was expecting lots of big cuts of grilled meat like, pork, beef, lamb, veal, fish etc, and the menu was disappointing in that area. I did go there for lunch so maybe the dinner menu has these things. I asked and our waiter said they do have more entrees on the dinner menu but did not specify, but that's OK cause we will be back to find out anyway. My girlfriend and I shared the Beef Stew and the Chicken Club Sandwich. I'll put it this way, the Beef Stew was probably one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth. Oh my god, so much flavor, green chilies, huge pieces of tender steak. I have dreamed about this stuff since i went last week. This is another must get on there menu, $15 and worth every penny!!! The Chicken sandwich was good. Thick piece of chicken, thick bacon, Swiss, and the fixin's. I liked it alot. We are so going back for dinner!!!
