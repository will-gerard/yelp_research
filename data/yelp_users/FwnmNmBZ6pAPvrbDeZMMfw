Great Starbucks location for doing some work. It's large and clean and usually not busy. However, HORRIBLE parking location. I've been here twice and it consists of driving around for 20 minutes praying that a parking spot opens up anywhere in the complex. Tons of near miss accidents and you usually end up parking on the other side of the block.

If you call with questions about adoptions, they will NEVER answer the phone. You get hold music forever. I waited 20 minutes after the machine said the wait time is around 1 minute. I've called 3 times trying to get info on how to adopt a new stray I saw there... Have never gotten through. It's a long drive for me so it's very inconvenient for me to travel there just to get some questions answered.  I would say around 60% if the dogs are not adoptable. They are either quarantined or strays that have to go through a waiting period. You can almost never find someone to help you look at a dog or answer questions. You can't put any dogs on hold to adopt when they become available.   I entered a drawing for a stray puppy that became available and it was extremely fishy, pulling a number out of the box but instead of reading the winning number the lady went to the back room for a few minutes and then came out and told us some guy in another city won the dog... He wasn't even there.  I went to the back to request to walk one of the other dogs and, before I could make my request, the guy closed the door on me and I waited for about 15 minutes in the sun before he opened the door to take my request. There was around 4 others in line.  I did want to say that once they gave me the dog to play with, they have these nice play cages out back around the corner where you can throw a ball or chew toy and stuff. This is the only thing stopping it from being 1 star.  I would say there's an extremely minimal effort being put in to actually find these animals homes. It could be so much better.

Horrible. I bought the most expensive wash because I dog sit for a friend and had dog hair everywhere. I paid for the VIP and afterwards there's still tons of dog hair everywhere. I also never got an air freshener that was supposed to come with it.   I guarantee if I would have bought the cheap wash I would have got identical service. It's not like the guys see VIP written on the window and put in extra effort vacuuming and wiping, so save your money.  In conclusion, if you just need a quick touch up, buy the cheap wash and it will be ok. If you actually need your car cleaned, then I recommend going somewhere else or doing it yourself. Unless you get your car detailed, it's not going to be very good, even if you pay for VIP service

Best. Bar. Ever. Their happy hour has a generous hour range and their prices are very good. Lunch hour prices are also amazing. The place has tons of tvs to watch the game, it's not very busy but the service is just so-so.  I've started going here regularly, it's probably my favorite bar.

Takes about 30 minutes+ to do a hand wash on the works but they do a great job. I typically just blast through the drive in washes but if there's a special occasion that I need a great interior/exterior wash for ill be coming here.

Very happy with their service. Dustin came out and fixed my garage door problem very quickly but a second issue came up that was small and would likely have been ignored by other technicians but would have caused future issues. Dustin stayed late working on it and although he had to leave for another appointment, he returned later that night off the clock and put in an extra hour to replace the faulty part. Incredible work ethic, very reasonable prices and an excellent attitude. Will definitely use them again and recommend them to my friends.

My gf and I spent a few hours starting a nice relaxing weekend here. She got a great French manicure from Tessa and loved it and we both got cuts from Emilio Armand. He did amazing work and was very professional and fun at the same time.  As for the salon, good prices for the upscale area and the views are fantastic. Very clean with trendy decore and everyone is extremely pleasant.  Highly recommended!

Daniel came out to do an estimate on my west valley home and he was a little late but he brought his carpet book with him. It had some good choices and the prices he quoted me were the better than anywhere else. We scheduled an install for the next weekend and he arrived early with a friend and did a very fast and very good job. He didn't have enough carpet to finish one of the closets so he came by the next morning and took care of everything.   I highly recommend these guys, they do great work and have the best prices in the valley. You just have to be open minded about scheduling and occasionally being late.

Great place. Nice vibe. Staff was extremely kind and coffee was yummy.   The only drawbacks is that their coffee sugar station didn't have any cream, it appears to be something you have to ask for. I suppose this is to prevent it from getting too warm.  Second is that they have 2 kinds of tables. Tiny ones that are more or less for one person and a couple of very large ones for 6 people or more. When me and my buddy wanted to pull out our laptops and get some work done, we couldn't fit at a small table (unless we each sat at different tables) so we decided to try one of the larger tables. The place was so busy that we felt awkward for using such a big table for just the two of us and we were getting a few snarky glances from other customers, so ultimately we just left.

I've been here twice and both times had issues.   Let me start by saying their croissants, crepes and coffee is pretty good, if you don't mind paying pretty high prices.  As for my visits:  The first time I sat on the patio but the doors auto locked, so to use the bathroom or refill my coffee, I had to go to the door and knock and wait for a server to let me in, which happened 3-4 times and was just annoying. They do not have an exit from the patio to walk around so we were just trapped there.  My last visit, the door problem was fixed but the staff abruptly took my crepe plate away before I was finished (like 1/3 left) and I ordered a chocolate scone which was the absolute worst thing I have put in my mouth on a long time. It had zero chocolate flavor, it tasted like dirt. Literally dirt. I'm not exaggerating.  Other than that, outdoor tables are pretty dirty with bird poop on them.   I normally wouldn't be this critical about a place but paying $20+ for a couple of baked goods, a crepe and some coffees, I expect something better.

This place is ok, nothing special. The prices seem a bit high for the OK service and the food you get. This location/area is not really trendy, cool and hip enough to command this kind of pricing, it's not like we're at Biltmore or Fashion Square. I was hoping for a yummy burger at reasonable prices that I can stop by regularly but the way it is now, I can only drop in on special occasions.
