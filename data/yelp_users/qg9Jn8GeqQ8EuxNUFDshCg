Tried to get ahold of this dude to no avail. No personal message on his answering machine at all. Website sucks for information to let me know what sorta work or quality thereof he does. I tried to call here @ 6:53pm tonight and again...no one picks up the phone. So fed up with flaky contractors. Do they want work or not?

We found this place in the Phoenix magazine. It didn't live up the write up. Our experience was bad service, long wait times and unfriendly staff. The food wait time was excessive. The food qaulity was average. We were charges $4 for a soda! Save your next food experience and money on some place else.

Came to this place to show some friends, from Jersy, a good time and good food....you failed me Black Chili Grill.  The service sucked, our server had attitude and went AWOL...had to go find her to place the order. The only good thing, to a slight degree, the food but not enough to make me come back again...ever. The place wasn't even busy when we arrived @ 7pm nor did it get busy by the time we left. It was embarrassing to have this sort of service when taking friends here for the first time. Shame on owner and management. For being a new restaurant, located at the Biltmore, you certainly would not pass the standards set by Gordon Ramsey.

I went to see Dr. Moody after my husband discovered him and talked so highly. I am so glad I did! Dr. Moody is so good that I switched physicians and made him my primary doctor. His personality is sweet and infectious and the service is impeccable! You will not be disappointed! The best decision you will ever make!

I stopped in today, as I have a few times before, to have a cup of coffee. I decided I wanted some pie and juice. How difficult is it to have fresh squeezed juice? Apparently, impossible for you guys.  I, once again, as in the past, asked what pies you had available, to no success. Again, you only had some Apple crumble, which was dry and disgraceful. If you're going to serve pie, do it right or leave it off the blackboard. Denny's has you hand over fist on good diner food. Food and good food is what brings people in. You have work to do before I will ever step into your place again. Don't rest on your laurels just because you're near ASU and Gammage. Your food is lackluster if that.

Upon entering, we were caught up with the aroma of the wood and seeing eerie animals on the walls. Excited to try out a new restaurant with friends. They do have a decent size menu with a variety of food choices. I really wanted a Bison burger and it wasn't available. For being a lodge, I assumed they would have game meat..no. So I chose the Bison Meatloaf..and even then it wasn't 100% Bison. It was part Bison and part beef. Really? The meatloaf was soft and mushy and tasteless. I couldn't finish it. Disappointing for $16.  The vegetables on my plate were dull and lacking color. Nothing Gordon Ramsay would serve . The gravy was a dull brown and tasteless. None of the flavors, within this dish, popped. Clearly this is bar food and caters to the les discerning college crowd.
