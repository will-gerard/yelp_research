Went here around 1 in the afternoon since there was a wait at the nail salon next door. Asked for a list of what's available, but apparently one simply doesn't exist. Least knowledgeable bartender I've ever encountered.   On the other hand, I do like their door.

I was craving cornbread so when I saw the Huevos con Masa on the menu I got really excited. Jalape√±o cornbread topped with two eggs and completed with chorizo queso. I have to admit that anything with that chorizo queso is going to taste great.   Savory, salty, sweet, delicious!! It's a winning combination of flavors.

Visited this cafe twice in one day. In the morning I ordered the espresso frappe with rice milk. It was tasty, and I appreciated the fact that you can replace cow's milk with soy, almond, or rice milk.   For lunch, I tried the chicken salad wrap. It was really good too. I especially liked the walnuts that were part of the filling. The only negative part of the experience was the wait time. I was with a group of 7 and it took about 35 minutes for the final plate to come out.

Ordered The Gobbler with sweet potato fries. The burger is on the sweeter side with the pear compote. In addition to the bacon and the tomato, it was a sweet, savory, and salty experience.   I really love sweet potato fries (they make them perfectly here) but suggest pairing the burger with another side. It turned out to be an overly sweet combination for me.

The perfect place for post-workout munchies. I ordered the tofu protein bowl with half brown rice and half sweet potato hash. I was really glad I did the half and half because the hash would've been overwhelmingly sweet otherwise.   It was surprisingly filling- I didn't even finish my bowl. Really enjoyed the sesame seeds with the roasted veggies and green curry flavor. I'm a fan!

Tried the Code Blue, which is their iced coffee shaken with condensed milk. Really refreshing- especially with the free cookie deal that's going on! The peanut butter cookie comes with peanut butter slapped on with peanuts on top. Really satisfying.   Overall, a super cute place for a group that looks like it has a great selection for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

The chicken pot pie pasty here is delicious. The filling wasn't too salty, the crust had the right about of flake and crunch, and the chicken & veggies were tender. It was the definition of comfort food in a conveniently sized, handheld package.  It also comes with additional chicken pot pie filling sauce on the side!

Went here with a party of 8 around 8 pm. It took about 45 minutes to get our food, and the server got two of our orders wrong. I ordered the pesto shrimp tacos- they were bland and I was still hungry after eating them. I tried the steak burrito too. It was basically a pound of meat wrapped in a tortilla.   The pro: good margaritas. Come for the drinks, skip the food.

Stopped here because my nails were looking ragged. Had Vi do my nails, and had such a great time! Everyone there was such a delight and were so considerate. Got a mani/pedi plus the 10% discount for just $33.   They were very busy so a bit of a wait- I recommend making an appointment. Also, saw plenty of gentlemen there, so everyone should come by!
