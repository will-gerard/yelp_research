Government care, when that is all that you can afford it is the best care you can get.

Never have I been to a Starbucks that denied they made something wrong. The woman seemed shocked that we wanted what we ordered. While we waited for the right drink another employee rang something and heard us talking about  the experience. When the woman brought the drink I offered to pay and the guy stood behind her giving a dirty look. Go to the Starbucks on McClintock and Guadalupe for good service.

This is the best facility if you want to learn discipline. All gyms of this nature are expensive. If you want the best Sitan is it. Thiago is the best coach available.

They do not honor their mistakes. They had a sign that said entire table but had exceptions. I should have taken a picture to show the false advertising. To add to it the air condition was broke on a 109 degree day.

After over two years of ordering the samething at the same location can they not get it right. When I say 5 ice cubes it is not light ice. I want 5 ice cubes. Six or seven is ok.   Light ice is not 5 ice cubes. Please listen to the customer. We spend way to much money at Starbucks to have anything less than the best.
