My husband and I live in Old Town and Zuzu is our local go-to bar/restaurant. My very favorite drink EVER is their Strawberry Basil En Fuego - perfect every time! The food is awesome, I love the groovy retro feel, wait staff is very attentive and now this is our favorite place to take our friends! Who would have thought our favorite place in town would be a hotel restaurant! We even swing by for breakfast some times too! Last night we took friends there for drinks and apps, then took our 2nd round of drinks outside and up to the balcony overlooking the pool and grounds. Totally cool!

Started using this company in April and best decision EVER! Have gone thru 4 cleaning services in 4 years and I hit the jackpot this time. My pool looks amazing, he comes EVERY week, always answers my texts promptly if I have a question and knows all about my pool vac so it works like a charm now. I can actually say I don't worry about my pool at all now - what a relief to be able to swim any time I want in a sparkling, beautiful pool that's mine! YAY!! Thank you Joe!!!

My husband and I love Postino and live in Old Town Scottsdale. We were really excited to visit this location and invited friends to join us last night for wine and bruschetta. I read the reviews and thought people were being picky about the music. NOT SO! The music is painfully loud and I was uncomfortable the second I walked in. We arrived at 7pm and there was plenty of parking and only 1 couple near the hostess stand milling about so I thought JACKPOT! We'll get a table quick. There were literally 3 empty booths right by the door and a few tables with hand written Reserved signs on them. Imagine my shock when the hostess said 35-40 minute wait! Probably a godsend because I was already sick of the music, but shouldn't there be a ton of people around if it takes 40 minutes to get a table on Saturday night? I'm still trying to connect the dots? Anyhoo. We left. Not going back until future reviewers say the volume control on the radio is working again and wait times match the number of people waiting on a table.
