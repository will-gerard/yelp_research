Nosh used to be my favorite breakfast and it is right around the corner from my house which made it easy. However, Nosh has gone downhill! The service is terrible. It took 30 minutes to get 2 bagels toasted with cream cheese. I always ask for light amount of cream cheese and they continue to add too much. I mean enough to cover 3 bagels! If they do that well, then they forget something else. The bagels are always cold. The quality of the taste of the bagels Is no longer as good as it used to be. They need to bring up their service and quality in order for me to go back.

Our favorite bagel spot in the area! Mmm.. It makes my mouth water just thinking about their bagels. The way they spread their cream cheese.. Oh man!

I love the atmosphere and feel of this place. I love being able to bring my dog to the nice patio they have available. However, there service is probably the worst I have ever seen! We have gone there multiple times and the service can either be OK or the worst I have ever seen! It takes about 20 mins to order something on average and the waiter or waitress never checks up on you. Then, getting the bill is awful as well! It is like they forget about you! Honestly, I wouldn't go here except for it being close to my house and the environment being very relaxing.

We love our Safeway. It is small, but big enough for all the items we need. It is a little more expensive than Walmart, but Walmart is a gross pool of filth.

My favorite Italian food place in Phoenix! The salad and bread are both amazing. I don't think you could order a bad entree. The wait times are longer then most, but well worth the wait!

I do not even want to give them a star. I had the worst food poisoning from this place. All I can say is I was in the bathroom for a day straight. I cautious you if you care about your stomach don't attempt to eat here.

Smelled like someone did something in there pants in this one. Shooting up Meth up front! I mean, I know it's goodwill and I was not expecting much, but I had some higher standards. Go if you want to catch something!

Really love the ice coffee! However, we went for bagels the other day and they were not good. I ordered a poppy seed bagel with cream cheese, but it tasted like a Costco bagel with very little flavor. My fianc√© ordered a onion with butter and they covered his bagel with butter. I mean covered! It was all butter in every bite. Not sure if we will return. We will go to Nosh for our bagel fix.
