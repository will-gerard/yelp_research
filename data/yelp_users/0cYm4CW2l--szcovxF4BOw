This place is hidden on the side of a strip mall, but It's worth the search. This place is northern Italian cuisine at it's finest. Almost makes me wish I was tall and had red hair. My companion and I enjoyed our meals immensely.  We ordered an antipasto (split, off the menu) and pasta e fagiole. My companion ordered one of the daily specials, Princess Chicken. I had the Eggplant Parmagiana. We split an order of tiramisu for dessert. Our meals came with hot bread and a garlic-infused butter spread.  The antipasto consisted of thinly sliced capaccolo, prosciutto, and a hard northern cheese. The pasta was al dente. The vegetables were cooked without being mushy. The pasta e fagiole had spaghetti instead of ditalini, but was otherwise great. The portions were more than ample. The tiramisu? Is there such a thing as "bad" tiramisu??  Our waiter was knowledgeable and the service was excellent,  Everything we ordered reminded me of home (New York City). This restaurant would not be out of place in NYC, Boston's North End or Providence's Federal Hill.

Been here several times. The prices are very reasonable. Not a big menu, but it's all Greek and it's all good. Gyros come on fresh pita bread with cold cucumber sauce and are the best west of Chicago. Spanokopita is excellent with the right amount of cheese to spinach. The mille feuille pastry is done right. The grilled chicken was moist.  My only quibble is that on each of our visits, the waitress kept disappearing on us. Sometimes, our food would be brought by the busboy; sometimes, by the cook.

I rented an apartment at La Privada for almost a year. I don't know about Marc T's experience, but it is not reflective of my experience or the experience of the person who posted under La Privada Condos.  First, The Good Points: the apartments, especially the two bedrooms, are spacious. La Privada is a gated community. There are two pools that are kept very clean. The main pool at the clubhouse is heated and there is a hot tub. There is a reasonably well-equipped workout room and a business center/clubhouse facility. The complex does have a nice appearance; shrubs are trimmed nicely and flower beds are well-tended. This past year, the entire complex was re-painted and the asphalt re-sealed. The maintenance personnel are friendly and do what they can for the tenants within the restrictions put in place by  management.  Apparently, there has been new management installed at La Privada. I haven't had any of the dishonesty issues as reported by others.  The Bad Points: Living at La Privada ain't cheap. Rents for a renovated two bedroom apartment run about $1350/mo +/- plus water/sewer/trash. But, the worst part is the construction of the buildings. It's about the worst I've ever seen. Insulation is non-existent. The brick walls radiate heat INTO the units in the summer and leach heat in the winter. My summer electric bills were in the $350-$400 range from May to September.  Because there is virtually  no insulation, conversations in normal tones can be heard between apartments; never mind loud music/tv. Maintenance is abysmally slow. It took almost FIVE months to repair water damage to my apartment that was caused by La Privada's own employees renovating the apartment over mine. This delay, I later found out, was not attributable to the maintenance department, but to the office staff. This mess was started by the in-house "plumber" who hooked up a new ice maker line. Instead of testing it, he went on a 90-minute lunch break. My apartment developed a new shower in the living room, hallway and 2nd bedroom.  The tenants at La Privada are paying to live in a gated community. However, the gates around the perimeter of the property have what we New Yorkers would call "cheeseball" locks. The gate next to my unit has a painted-over lock, the keyhole is filled with dried paint. Access is achieved by pushing the gate up and back on it's hinges -- hinges that are made out of large machine screws.  No key is required to open this gate. Push on it and Voila!! Open sesame... The office can be told about these problems until a tenant is blue in the face. Nothing will happen. See above paragraph...  When being shown the apartments, I was NOT shown the apartment I would eventually be moved into. The explanation, which I accepted, was that there was still a tenant in the unit. It wasn't until I moved in that I found out WHY the previous tenant wanted out. Upstairs, in a two bedroom apartment, there was a family of six living. A husband, wife, mother-in-law, teenager and two toddlers.   The toddlers, apparently, were in training to be track stars. The running (or pounding) back-and-forth across their floor (my ceiling) starting at approx 5:45 am until, sometimes,10:00 pm. Let's not forget the teenager, who wants to be an NBA point guard. Whenever Mom and Dad weren't home, he was practicing his basketball dribble. After I moved in, it took management TEN FREAKIN' WEEKS to move them out!! This, despite the fact that the previous tenant had complained about this family. The previous tenant was moved to another apartment and so it was my turn. Management's position? We're doing the best we can...   There are a few young people living at La Privada; but not many. While I'm not exactly a youngster (late 50s), I'm not ready for the old folks' home either. La Privada is filled with old fogies. The geezer who now lives above me complains to management about conversations in even the most modest of tones. I live by myself. Apparently,her major complaint concerns my using the telephone late at night and early in the morning. I guess she expects that I will have no communication with friends/family who live on the east coast or try to conduct personal business with credit card companies/banks/etc who have call centers in India or the Philippines.  In sum, the lack of sound and weather insulation at La Privada is the biggest drawback. I lay this problem directly at the feet of ownership. Even though apartments are being "renovated" (i.e. new cabinets, carpeting, appliances, etc) they are doing NOTHING to add insulation.  Unless you don't mind living your life as an "open book" or you're an exhibitionist, you may wish to live elsewhere. Living at La Privada, not only will almost all of your conversations be overheard, but even a couple's most intimate moments will be easily detected by their neighbors. I know; I've heard enough of them.

Over the last three months, I've ordered: Kung Pao Chicken, Mu Shoo Pork, Shrimp in Lobster Sauce, Won Ton Soup, General Tsao's Chicken, Spare Ribs, Egg Foo Yung, Pork Lo Mein, House Fried Rice, Pot Stickers Crab Puffs, Pu Pu Platter and EggRolls. I have yet to hit a clunker.  If you like REALLY hot mustard (Pot Stickers & Egg Rolls demand hot mustard), ask for the "House Mustard" not the mustard packets. Yum!!  Being a native New Yorker and learning to like chinese cuisine in NYC's Chinatown and spending my college years eating in Boston's Chinatown, I'd say the food here wouldn't be out of place in either of those settings. My order has always been freshly prepared and hot.  The owner takes pride in his work and takes credit cards. The food is excellent and reasonably priced. They deliver. What more can a bachelor ask for?

I wouldn't fly Southwest Airlines if they were the last airline on the planet. Period. I hope Yelp allows me to post this review with no stars because that's what they deserve. Southwest committed THE cardinal airline sin: they abandoned a traveller who was, literally, thousands of miles from home.  Southwest has the only non-stop between Phoenix and Manchester, NH. After making my reservation and paying an extra charge on top of the airfare, I was allowed to board before other passengers. The Gate Agent entered the aircraft and sat down next to me. After about 5 seconds, she asked me to follow her off the aircraft.  I was informed that my reservation, for which I'd already paid, would NOT be honored. I was deemed a "Person of Size" and it was her decision that I needed to buy a second seat. Oh, BTW, there are no more seats on this flight (the ONLY non-stop to New Hampshire). No, you can't fly another airline because we don't "code share." Your credit card will be refunded in 2-3 weeks.   Southwest stranded me 2000 miles from my (at that time) home.  Later, after flying home on another airline, I checked Southwest's website. There was no mention of "Person(s) of Size", the need to buy a second ticket, or the Gate Attendant is the sole arbiter in this matter. Basically if you're more than 30-40 lbs over your ideal weight, you will be subject to this policy. I hope your credit card isn't maxed out.  Subsequently, whenever the topic of airlines comes up, I tell everyone within earshot of this experience. I was a business owner. I forbade my people from flying on Southwest. Yeah, they flew my bags for free; but they wouldn't let ME on the plane. How useful is that?  Now, I'm retired. When I need to return to New Hampshire from Arizona (roughly every other month) I fly US Air.

I've eaten here a number of times since retiring to the Phoenix area, My drivers loved this place and now I understand why. The kitchen is small, but the food is first-rate. Even if you're not driving a "big rig," the food is good enough to go out of your way for.   Today, I had the "Daily Special," a carne asada burrito. My friend had the quesadilla. Both came with homemade refried beans and spanish-style rice. Drinks were Coca-Cola products. Portion sizes were excellent and the drinks were bottomless. With tip, lunch for two was under $20.00. I can also recommend the homemade chips and salsa, the "Grande Burrito" for breakfast and the "Big Rig Burger." I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal here.  For Truckers:   a) If you're addicted to chrome, they have a HUGE chrome shop; the biggest I've seen west of the Iowa 80 (truckers will know what I'm talking about). They have a repair shop and a radio shop. They also wash and wax your rig by HAND!!. The price is reasonable and my drivers swore by their work;  b) The showers are CLEAN and HUGE. Danny's gives you a washcloth and a couple of towels. It's worth the $10;  c) Parking ain't cheap.  In fact, they now only sell parking spaces on their lot for 24 hrs. It's better than the Flying J across the street (the "J" has a "no dropped trailers" policy). Danny's does allow dropped trailers and they do have a security patrol (in a golf cart). My guys used to drop their trailers (with a pin lock and glad hand locks) and bobtail to Walmart (on 75th Ave) to stock up on groceries.   Truckers, BEWARE!! Phoenix, AZ has a 9.3% (6.6% state + 2.7% local) sales tax on all non-edible items and even a 1.5% food tax on groceries!!

Went to the Coin Gallery to sell some coins that had become excess to my collection. I upgraded my collection by purchasing several coins that would replace the ones I wanted to sell. I did my homework by consulting the Coin Dealer Newsletter (known in the hobby as "CDN" or the "Grey Sheet"). It is The Bible of the coin collecting world. According to the latest edition of the "Grey Sheet," interest in Morgan Silver Dollars (my type of coins) and the prices paid for them was the highest it's been in recent years. According to the CDN, action for Morgans at recent auctions and coin shows in Baltimore, Las Vegas and Long Beach was brisk and represented a renaissance in prices. Like I said, I did my homework.  Took a look around the Coin Gallery while I waited for assistance. In display cases, along with a couple of 100 oz silver bars, a number of coins were "slabbed" as in graded by a professional grading service. The coins I saw were graded between AU-58 and MS-63. I also noticed these prices were pretty stiff.   I presented my coins and asked if these coins would be candidates for upgrades. After examination, I was told my coins were nice (they were already graded by PCGS as ("Mint State") MS-64 and MS-65 (investment grade coins)). But, they were unlikely to be upgraded.   Knowing these coins would be some of the nicest in his shop, I asked if he was interested in purchasing my coins. The counterman stepped away and went into an office. Knowing my individual coins were worth between $92 and $345 EACH (according to the "Grey Sheet"), I expected a substantial offer. Needless to say, I was shocked, almost speechless, when he offered me $110 for a coin the "Grey Sheet" says is worth $345.   I tried to engage him, to negotiate. The counterman's excuse for such a low offer and his unwillingness to negotiate? "Morgans aren't selling." Tell that to the publisher at The Coin Dealer Newsletter and the coin show vendors at Baltimore, Las Vegas and Long Beach.   I've bought, sold and traded coins and bullion for years. I've had dealers offer me fair prices and not-so fair prices. I've had dealers tell me they weren't interested in my coins. It's all part of the coin world. However, I've NEVER received such a low-ball offer for my goods as I received from The Coin Gallery. Not EVER. Period.   Needless to say, I took my coins to another Phoenix coin shop where I received a much fairer price (over $300) for this coin, in addition to the other coins I had with me.  In sum, a very bad experience. I won't be returning to the Coin Gallery -- unless I'm willing to buy at prices ABOVE retail and sell coins at prices low enough to almost qualify as giving them away.

This is Old School Mexican and just about as good as it gets. Inside, it looks dark and dingy. The furniture looks as if it were bought in 1963. The dining room/bar is well-worn and comfortable.   Upon sitting, drink orders were taken and homemade salsa and chips were brought and refilled without our asking. The food arrived quickly after ordering and it was HOT (temperature and spice).   The food is great and there's plenty of it. The three of us enjoyed green chile rellenos, enchildas and burritos. Each entree came with refried beans, spanish rice and cole slaw. They have a full-service bar, but we've only been there for lunch. Soda on the gun are RC products. The iced tea is brewed (kudos!!). Service was well above average. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable. Our glasses were never empty for long.   The food is excellent. The waitstaff is attentive. The prices are reasonable. Three men had lunch (with a tip) for under $40. What more can one ask?

Saw what I thought was a Montblanc rollerball pen at a second-hand seller. It had all the hallmarks of a Montblanc, but the resin color wasn't right. I bought the pen and took it straight to the Montblanc Boutique in Fashion Square.  I walked in and told the lady I had two questions. The second question was entirely reliant on the reply I got to the first question. Question #1: Is this rollerball pen a genuine Montblanc? Question #2: Do you have any blue refills?  The lady, McKenzie, was friendly, pleasant and knew her stuff. She examined the pen with a loop and pronounced it genuine. She knew that it was from the "Bordeaux Collection" that hadn't been offered in a number of years. She was able to tell me the approximate age of the pen by examining the hallmarks (it was marked as "W Germany" as opposed to today's "Germany"). Finally, she told me I made a good deal.  The Montblanc Boutique had blue rollerball refills in stock. For McKenzie's expertise, I was more than happy to spend the extra couple of bucks more than I would have paid for the same refill at a discount office supply store. McKenzie, thank you.

Uncle Sal's was recommended by a friend. Being raised in New York City (and having an Italian grandmother), I love Italian food.  Four of us went on the busiest night  of the week, the Saturday before Easter Sunday. The food was impeccable. My cioppino was more than almost anyone could eat, the seafood was excellent. My friends' entrees were lasagna (meat), gnocchi and lobster ravioli. All were superb. We shared 2 orders of the Mozarella Caprese. The tomatoes were soft enough to be ripe and the cheese was melted perfectly. Caesar salads were had by all. My only small nitpick was that anchovies had to be specified, they aren't automatic. The carafe of red vino di casa was fine.  The service was excellent. The waitstaff was there for us when we needed them without being intrusive.   Excellent food. This restaurant wouldn't be out of place in Little Italy in NYC, the North End of Boston or Federal Hill in Providence.

The secret to keeping your Mercedes diesel for a million miles is to find a good mechanic, change the filters and fluids when the mfr recommends and use OEM parts. I can't speak highly enough of these men. First, my car was serviced by Ken's brother. After he passed away, I started bringing my W-123 to Ken. He's never diagnosed a problem on my car incorrectly. He always uses OEM parts. The necessary repairs have always been completed on a timely basis The cost of the repairs have always been for the estimate or less than the estimate.

Absolutely the best eggplant parmigiana sandwich I've ever had -- and I grew up in New York City. The cold cuts are absolutely top drawer. Thought I'd wandered into a deli in Brooklyn. They even have Dr Brown's soda at a REASONABLE ($1.39) price!!

Had an eye exam and a couple of pairs of glasses ordered from this location. The exam was thorough and professional. However, my problem was with the staff. You would think after spending almost $500, you'd be afforded good service.  Apparently, this chain has scraped the bottom of the barrel when it comes to their non-medical staff. When I called to find out if my glasses were ready, the young lady I spoke to left me on hold for 25 minutes. I hung up the phone and called back. No apology, just was told by one of her fellow workers that she was scatterbrained because she was pregnant. WTF??  The saving grace was the assistant manager (Stacy). I was pretty ticked when I showed up. She took control, fitted my glasses (two pairs) and wouldn't allow me to leave the store until my glasses were cleaned and I was satisfied that they fit perfectly. Kudos to this young lady .  Would I return? Hmm... Only if I can get service from this assistant manager.

An excellent choice for authentic Mexican food. The bottomless chips and salsa the waitress brought at the beginning of the meal were excellent. These were constantly refilled throughout our meal.   My personal favorites are the carne asada and the cheese, beef and jalapeno nachos. My dining companions enjoyed the chicken enchiladas and the cheese quesadillas. There is a list of tequilas available for every taste. They have Dos Equus Amber on tap (my favorite). The sopopillas for dessert are the best in Phoenix.  The decor is shopworn but comfortable. The service is very good without being intrusive. There is parking available in their lot or on the street. They accept credit cards.

Love this place!! The pulled pork and the brisket are above average. That said, I couldn't find a smoke ring on the brisket. The sweet sauce is very good. The "tangy" is excellent. IMHO, the best sides are the Ranch Beans and the Mac n Cheese....   But, the St Louis Ribs are the reason to eat at Bobby-Q!! These baby back ribs are succulent and the meat falls right off the bone. They have the right balance between rub and sauce. The sweet and tangy flavors are what barbecue is supposed to be. I couldn't find the smoke ring under the rub and the heavy sauce. Sauce-less is not an option. Order an extra cup of the tangy sauce...  The cornbread is moist; a remarkable achievement since most places it's dry as a bone. Bobby-Q's cornbread is excellent and complimentary (Hint, hint to those from Nebraska who believe in charging for dinky little miniature cupcake-sized portions). It's even better with the whipped butter and/or honey on top...  Our waitress was knowledgeable and her service was top-notch. Our iced tea glasses were NEVER empty and she refilled the corn bread basket TWICE. (Hint, hint Nebraska...)  My only REAL complaint is the handicapped parking situation. The handicapped parking spaces are a couple hundred feet from the front door. I try to park out back near the "Take-Out" door. There are six spaces there. These spaces are approx 75 ft from the dining room doors, but are NOT reserved for the handicapped.

Read a number of good reviews here on this establishment. Last night, my friend and I had a hankering for prime rib so we decided to try Feeney's.  We arrived and were seated promptly. Drink orders were taken. Iced tea only (my friend has been on the wagon over 25 years!!). Small glass, but was constantly refilled. Ordering was no problem. My friend ordered the small cut of prime rib (approx 10 oz) and a baked potato w sour cream and chives. I ordered the "Feeney's Cut" (the largest, approx 24 oz) of prime rib with rice pilaf. Dessert was fried ice cream. There is complimentary salad bar. Warm rye and pumpernickel breads and butter come with the dinners.   Maybe the kitchen was having an off night. Maybe the vendor supplied substandard beef. Maybe the refrigeration was screwed up. I don't know. Let's start with the salad bar. All the usual fare: mixed iceberg lettuce, carrots, 3 bean salad, cottage cheese, cici beans, bacon bits, red onions, croutons, etc. There were four kinds of salad dressings, including ranch, russian and creamy italian. The ingredients were fresh, especially the lettuce. However, the salad bar itself was mildly cool, not cold. Otherwise the salad bar, in my experience, is nothing special.  The prime rib orders arrived as we ordered them: medium rare. Small plastic cups of horseradish sauce and au jus were on the plates. My rice pilaf was starchy and stuck together. My friend's baked potato was underdone. After trimming off 20% of the meat because one end was all fat and gristle, both orders were a tad dry. There was no rub on the exterior; no salt, no cracked peppercorns, nothing. The prime rib is really nondescript. The fried ice cream dessert was well executed.  The service was good. The iced tea server (that's all he does, apparently) was working overtime. I'd like to give this restaurant 2.5 stars because I find nothing about this restaurant particularly outstanding. They served us perfectly average fare.

I went to a local hotel after a minor disaster. Until things could be sorted out, I decided a hotel was the best course of action. I went to the Hotel Tempe/Phoenix Airport InnSuites Hotel.   Wonderful location, nice amenities, my junior suite was clean and neat with a large Sony LCD television with HBO, a small microwave oven, two-burner cook top and a full-size refrigerator. Ownership, it seems, wants a top-notch facility for their price point. Too bad some of their employees don't feel the same way.  The maid was excellent. The housekeeping staff went out of their way for me. It was much appreciated, even giving my long-gone high school Spanish a workout. The maintenance/grounds staff, hmm....  The pool is supposed to close at 10:00, the employees lock the gates at 9:15. You can call the front desk, but they are often swamped and take the phone off the hook. You can walk to the front desk and receive absolutely no help from the hotel staff. The houseman, ignoring the obviously overwhelmed front desk clerk, offered to open the pool for five minutes, because "we're supposed to lock it at ten o'clock."  Other hotel employees can see the front desk clerk is overwhelmed, but won't even answer the telephones to help her out. How about cross-training some of the night employees so they can at least answer the telephone?   The breakfast is wonderful. The "Happy Hour" is a really nice perk. For it's price point, this is an excellent value. However, the attitude of some of the employees will really frost some of the guests. With 8% unemployment, these people should be easily replaced.  Hmmph, those pesky guests...

A first-class operation. The proprietor and his staff know their stuff. They were able to tell me which of my knives were worth sharpening and which should, ah, be cast away. The sharpening service is excellent.  From viewing the products on display at their new location, I suspect the store really favors eastern cutlery. There is some German cutlery (Henckels and Wustof are my favorites), but the emphasis is on Japanese blades. Some of their goods are VERY expensive. However, their offerings are professional-grade knives and other implements used in professional hotel and restaurant food service.  As someone who originally bought his knives from the long-gone and sorely-missed Stoddard's in downtown Boston, MA more years ago than I care to recall; I despaired that I would never find another storefront that would satisfy me. I had to move to Arizona to find a store their equal.

While there are groceries sold here, the real emphasis is on their italian deli and the other foods they serve. The food they serve, sandwiches, salads and entrees, are fantastic. The pastries, including sfogiatelle and chocolate croissants, are fresh and scrumptious. The place is soccer central. The television is always on ESPN Deportes.   The spaghetti a la vongele ($25.00) is absolutely the best I've had in Phoenix. Almost makes me think I'm near an ocean. My companion loved the veal chop ($34.00). Both entrees came with a salad. There are a number of genuine italian beverages, including orangina and birra Moretti.  On previous visits I enjoyed a number of their sandwiches. They come with an arugala salad and there isn't a clunker on the menu. The forza, the cafone and the abuffino are my favorites. Sandwich prices range between $8.25 to $8.95; not cheap by any stretch. However, like a wise old man once said, "Good oats command a good price. But, if you're willing to settle for oats that have been run through the horse once..." (LOL!!)  Some reviewers have had less than desirable service. I can only say that the service given to me and whoever was with me was top notch. The young fellow behind the register and the young lady who brought our food were courteous, generous with their time and kind to those friends of mine who were not familiar with italian food.   Count on spending at least $15-$17 per person. That said, it's well worth it.

The ice cream: It's OK. I learned about the best ice cream while living in Boston. I was in college when Steve Herrell created "Steve's Ice Cream" in Cambridge, Mass. After a falling out with his partners, he opened "Herrell's". Then there was "Toscanini's," "Emack & Bolio's," "Ben & Jerry's," and the ol' reliable "Carvel."   Sweet Republic has some good recipes, however, where this organization falls short is in their business practices. Their portions are small (I can live with that), but they did something I've NEVER seen before. They charge extra for having your ice cream in a cone!!  Not one of the businesses in the first paragraph would have the temerity to charge you extra for having your ice cream in a cone!  While some ice cream shops do charge if you upgrade the cone, they always had a cone that was included in the price.   At $4.65 for two small scoops and paying extra $1.00 for the cone, this place is now being run by the accountants. And, for the size of the portions, they're making a killing!!

Since my initial review, I've been contacted, through Yelp, by someone who I originally believed to be a devoted fan or a company shill. Since she didn't review Sweet Republic, I believed she might be the latter.   However, after being asked two times to no longer contact me (and being blocked on TWO separate accounts), she contacted me AGAIN through a third Yelp account. This third time, she included information in her message that could only be obtained through a website other than Yelp.   Yelp management has been contacted. However, no action has been taken to date. Reading their Terms of Service ("TOS"), Yelp states that stalking is prohibited. But, these same TOS say that Yelp is under no obligation to enforce their TOS.  Fans are cool; stalkers are not. Understandably, Sweet Republic has fans who are devoted. However, if you write a critical review of this business, you may be confronted by a stalker.  It's so cute!! I have a stalker!! (ROFLMFAO!! @ P b., P O. & Catherine M. all of whom are one and the same nitwit!!)

The subs I loved when I was a kid at the Jersey Shore have now gone global!! I've been a fan of Jersey Mike's Subs since it was Mike's Subs In Pt Pleasant, NJ.  OK, the bread isn't from Baldanza's. Phoenix is a long way from Long Branch, NJ. However, it's fresh and stands up to the oil and vinegar. My recommendation: if you like Italian cold cuts, the #2 or the #5. The cheesesteaks are the best you're gonna find outside Geno's in Philadelphia. Unless it's a "hot sub," ask for it "Mike's Way." You'll be glad you did.  This isn't Subway. There are no $5 footlongs here. However, the sandwiches here are much larger and, unlike Subway, the only turkey cold cuts at Jersey Mike's is the turkey breast. The meats and cheeses are all sliced to order and their quality is first rate. You can taste the difference.   The employees are great. If you go in there more than a couple of times, they recognize you. They're great with kids. There are a couple of televisions (at least one is always tuned to "Sportscenter"). The soda is unlimited and they accept credit cards.

I used to believe that, just like there was no such thing as a bad day of golf (or fishing), there was no such thing as bad barbecue. Then, I went to Dickey's in Scottsdale.   I was chased out of my house by a posse of women/children who wanted to watch Smurfs. I wanted to watch the Lions-Saints football game. Stacey's BBQ on Shea no longer has a television. I thought I'd try Dickey's Barbecue Pit. It ticks off my g/f when I eat barbecue. SHE listens to my cardiologist. I ordered half a rack of pork ribs, barbecue beans and iced tea.  Dickey's must have pigs bred just for them. I've never seen pork ribs with so much fat on them. Most barbecue joints will brag about how their spare rib meat  falls off the bone. At Dickey's, the meat on these pork spare ribs hung on the bone like it was super-glued. There was no discernible rub on the ribs. In spite of asking for the barbecue sauce on the side, it was sweet barbecue sauce that was splashed on my ribs. The hot barbecue sauce (next to the soda machine) was tangy.  Most barbecue joints brag about their iced tea. At Dickey's, I was handed a cup and pointed toward a soda machine. Shaved ice and Nestea. No lemons. The only lemonade available was Minute Maid diet. Blecch.   The barbecue beans? If you like your barbecue beans mushy and bland, this is the place for you. I've had better beans that were poured out of a can.   In sum, Dickey's is to barbecue what Earl Scheib's is to automobile paint jobs. My meal was everything barbecue was not supposed to be. The best part of my meal (besides leaving) was the yellow plastic cup. No one could get me in these doors again, not for love or money. Stacey's: PLEASE get a new television.

Eastern European cuisine and baked goods. The  breads and pastries are baked fresh daily.  We had a loaf of their bread with dinner. Everyone at dinner complimented the bread. The Baklava was made on the premises and the piece served was HUGE in comparison to others around town. The Lady Fingers dipped in coconut were excellent.  The service was quick and knowledgeable. The prices were VERY reasonable.  They also serve some savory options such as the meat burek, sausage and gyros. I saw a meat burek after I'd already had lunch. I'll be trying that the next time I'm in their neighborhood. Their cooler stocks Coca Cola products. Coffee is brewed fresh on the premises.

I went in to Beyond Baggage, in the Paradise Valley Mall, today looking for a luggage tag. No one was in the store. I was also window shopping, looking for a replacement of my trusty carry-on bag. The bags that would fit the bill were all pretty pricey.   When  asked for some help, it was like I was talking to a pillar. The fellow behind the counter couldn't have been less helpful.  I asked if he had any luggage tags, He said no. When I browsed around the store, in fact, there were some hanging on the back side of a display right in the center of the floor.  I took this item, marked $3.50,  to the counter. The man handed me two singles back as change. This store employee couldn't have cared less. His service didn't even rise to the level of "awful."   They'll never see me again.

I've rented a bay there whenever one of my cars needed work. Prior to my first rental, I had to watch a video and sign a release. they drove my car in and put it up on the lift. Understand, this establishment only rents you a lift and tools. It's not meant to be an ordinary mechanic's  garage.  As the owner of a couple of foreign cars, including a diesel Mercedes, it's hard to find places that won't take you for an arm-and-a-leg just to change the oil. I bring my own oil, filters and tools. I'm usually in-and-out in an hour.   There are entire tool chests for rent (with air tools) for an additional $10/hr. They can order whatever parts you need, from oil and filters all the way to crate motors/transmissions. There is access to online Mitchell Manuals if you need a reference materials. I just wish they had a parts cleaner.   If you get in over your head (I have), ask for Rick. He will help you or take over the job for a reasonable price. I've seen him working on Ferraris, Porsches and Mercedes.   There has been some confusion. I've seen other "professional" mechanics in there. Remember, they rent a bay just like you. I've seen some pretty cheesy activity by some of these guys (Hello, Don). If Rick works on your car (at your request) you will get a U-Fix-It receipt. He stands behind his work. He did on one of my cars.

I love barbecue. It is a uniquely American form of preparing food. When done right, it's phenomenal. When done wrong, it's a feeling like a date where your girl was responding to you in all the right ways and you thought everything was perfect -- until you get to her apartment. You end up at home alone! (LOL!! thinking of Otter in "Animal House" mouthing, "Not great??") I've eaten barbecue all over our country. Arkansas, California, Texas, Kansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina even in Massachusetts and New Hampshire.  I was told by some friends that Pork On A Fork ("POAF") up near the City of Phoenix's Deer Valley Airport was one of the best around. That's a schlep for me as I hang my hat about 20 miles away. Yesterday, I had to get my car "smogged" near the airport and I remembered this place as I passed it.  Now, I'm kinda pissed cuz my car didn't pass (Hey, I love my 30 y.o. diesel. But who knew about emissions tests in 1983?). I ordered half a rack of ribs (thinking I would get pork spare ribs), bbq beans, sweet potato fries and iced tea. I was really disappointed when my plate showed up with baby back ribs on it. Just about every bbq joint I've ever been to dries these babies out til they're almost pork jerky. Boy, was I mistaken and did my day improve in a hurry!  Pork On A Fork does it right. This is one of the VERY few places where I've had baby back ribs that were moist, tender and had a perfect rub on them. The meat came right off the bone. They really didn't need sauce. However, I tried two different sauces, the sweet and tangy and Crazy Jessie's -- loved them both.  The sides of sweet potato fries were good, I just wished they gave you more. The bbq beans were almost perfect. Tangy with chunks of burnt ends and onion in them, they're the best bbq beans I've had in years. The iced tea was a Coca-Cola product, Gold Peak. Doesn't anyone in Phoenix brew their own iced tea??  I'm gonna be addicted to this place. My only real criticisms? Ya gotta make yer own iced tea and could ya be a little more generous with sides?

I've been here a number of times since my last review. For about the last year and one-half, when I've eaten here, I've told myself that the meal that was just served me was an aberration. I know the owners know how to do BBQ right. However now, in the immortal words of Popeye, "I've taken all I can stands. I can't stands no more!!"  In the last eighteen months or so, the quality and quantity of the food has been slowly declining. In the last six months, it seems the slope has become steeper. Tonight, I came in with a friend of mine and was looking forward to some nice ribs and a couple of solid sides. I asked for "Three fingers, beans and cornbread. Oh, and add a side of burnt ends."  The three young men behind the counter looked at me like I had a third eye in the middle of my forehead. They asked me what I was talking about. They understood the beans and cornbread part. However, they didn't have a clue as to what I meant by "three fingers" or "burnt ends." This should have been my clue to turn around and head out the door. BTW, my dinner companion is a vegetarian and even she knows what is meant by "three fingers."  I explained that "three fingers" meant three pork ribs and "burnt ends" were usually what was the crispy end of the brisket or pork shoulder. They still didn't have a clue as to what I was talking about. In the end, I was given three very small babyback ribs that were luke warm, but burnt to a crisp. They had almost no flavor. The beans I ordered used to have big chunks of meat in them and a real tangy flavor. The beans I received tonight were almost mushy and there was NO meat in them. The cornbread, in the shape of a small cupcake, was warm and moist. I ordered a small unsweet iced tea. Little did I know that POAF now has sweet tea, two kinds of flavored tea (watermelon?? really??), but no unsweet tea.  My vegetarian companion order the mac n chz, large waffle fries and a side salad. She reported that her meal was more than satisfactory. However, most of the rest of us, when we come to a BBQ joint, are coming for the MEAT -- not the sides.   In this case, not only was I woefully disappointed with the quality of the food, I was waited on by three employees who, one would think, were just plucked from Mickie Ds or Burger King. They had no idea what barbecue is or should be.   I'm hoping someone in the chain of command at POAF actually reads this review. I may come in again in a couple of weeks to see if things have changed. However, until that time, in good conscience, I can't recommend this place as having even half-decent BBQ. IMHO, the meal I was served tonight was one step above Dickie's. Folks, I would rather gnarfle the Garthok before I would EVER consider Dickie's "good BBQ."

After my last review, I received a response from the owner, Justin. I had my hopes up that he would take the bull by the horns and  things would be much improved. In that spirit, I returned to POAF on 9/28. Mondays, as a rule, aren't too busy. Therefore, it makes sense that the staff would have the time to be diligent.  I was hoping for a brisket sandwich, beans, mac n cheese and a Dr Pepper. This is typical barbecue. At 12:15 pm on a Monday, I was told that they had run out of brisket! I settled for half a rack of babybacks and the aforementioned sides. BTW, POAF's soda dispenser was out of Dr Pepper. I settled for sweet tea.  The babybacks were smoky, a bit chewy and hung on to the bone -- and they were almost room temperature. The beans were good and spicey. There were a couple of scraps of meat in the beans. However, not as much meat as there once was. The mac n cheese was, as usual, very good.  I'm trying to be supportive and understanding. I really am. However, I just don't understand how a barbecue joint runs out of brisket, on a Monday, before any real lunchtime rush. It's these missteps that have become emblematic of my trips to this establishment. I worked my way through college in a hotel kitchen. I watched the prep chef get fired over not having a steamship round ready on time. I'm wondering who was in charge of smoking briskets and if they still have a job....   Management has to solve these problems. One day, there's no meat in the beans. The next time, there is meat in the beans, but not as much as there used to be. Lastly, a failure to adequately prepare enough of one of your signature menu items to get through a Monday lunch is inexcusable. The problems here are a failure of leadership. I don't blame the laborers. I blame management and ownership for this carelessness.   I hate to say it, but it almost seems like POAF is coasting on it's reputation.

I grew up in Brooklyn. This is NY pizza. Instead of flying back to NY, all I have to do is schlep over to Glendale.   The thin crust (which is what REAL pizza has) is just crisp enough to give the slice the stiffness that won't allow the sauce or the cheese to end up in your lap -- or on your shirt. The $3.75 Lunch Special is great. Two slices and unlimited soda. There are many pizza toppings offered. I like mine plain (with a little red pepper) or with sausage.   The antipasto is exactly as you would find at my mother's house. Lots of ham, salami, mozarella cheese, salami, black olives and pepperoncini. Upon request, they will add anchovies. Gotta have the anchovies.  There's unlimited soda. They accept AE, M/C and Visa. It's a taste of home 2000 miles west.

I don't understand all the haters here. If you've never had REAL NY pizza, this is it!! I grew up in Mill Basin, a neighborhood in Brooklyn. The sausage pizza is just like being home. My personal favorite is the small antipasto (w anchovies) and garlic knots.  The lunch special of two slices and a cup of soda for $3.75 is a great value and right out of Brooklyn.  You may claim you're from NY, but if you're living in West BuFu, Washington, you don't know diddly about pizza. Go back to eating that mush they sell at Peter Piper's or Domino's.

Had a couple of different meals at Stacy's. The first was eat-in. I had the smoked pork ribs, sweet potato fries and red beans with rice. Stacy's had a television set with Monday Night Football on.  The meat was fresh, moist and perfectly smoked, the SPICY sauce had just enough heat and the sweet potato fries were the best I've had west of St Louis. Red Beans with Rice were flavorful enough for a side dish.They were out of biscuits, so I had to settle for ho-hum garlic toast. Stacy's has unlimited iced tea/soda.  The second meal I had was take-out.  Smoked pork ribs, sweet potato fries, BBQ beans and Mac&Chz. for a small gathering at my home.   The pork ribs were just about perfect. The meat was smoky, moist and just about ready to fall off the bone. The sweet BBQ Sauce is tangy with just a hnt of vinegar. The spicy BBQ sauce had just enough fire to get you to want to reach for your drink. The BBQ beans were just about the best, with chunks of meat/fat in them. Mac& Chz isn't my favorite, but my friends all complimented them.  Prices are reasonable, especially for the half slabs. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They accept Mastercard, Visa & AE. As a customer, I'm hooked.

Regret to inform, but last Thursday night, 11/29, the place was dark and the chairs and televisions were gone. CLOSED... I'm wondering where my friend goes to get back the $35 he paid for their beer mug program last week...  Passed their address on 12/10, their signage is down. They're toast... R.I.P. Nimbus

Had a number of meals here. The food is well above average. The craft beer choices are numerous and excellent. There are televisions in the bar and the restaurant area. So my question is: Why did my Friday luncheon companion and I have the ENTIRE restaurant to ourselves? The restaurant on the corner was packed with Friday afternoon diners, refugees from local business offices.  Today, we both had their Bavarian Pretzel appetizer, Hummus with Sweet Relish and Pita Bread, the Eggplant Sandwich and The Cuban Sandwich. As that my lunch companion is a teetotaler, we had the iced tea.  The pretzels were good; huge (it took up an entire plate) soft and, upon request, served with dijon mustard. The Hummus, served in a bowl made by a drunken potter, was smooth and had the pleasant twist of being served with a sweet relish. On warmed pita bread, this appetizer was excellent.  The unsweetened ice tea was somewhat unusual. It had a flavor to it (passion fruit?) that was not unpleasant, but certainly unusual. Admittedly, I'm a stick-in-the-mud. There are some things I expect. Iced tea tasting like tea is one of them. I'm not saying the taste of this offering was unpleasant. I'm saying that patrons should be offered a choice of straight  iced tea or the flavored version.  My companion enjoyed her Eggplant Sandwich. Firm, not soggy, we were impressed. The Cuban Sandwich is an American fusion interpretation on the Cubano. There was ample pork, served on a baguette with melted cheese  and spicy pickles.  Warning!! These sandwiches are not small by any stretch of the imagination. Both sandwiches came with a side choice of cole slaw vinagrette or french fries. On previous occasions, their Chicken Sandwich, Fried Cauliflower and Fried Calamari stand out in my mind as unique and flavorful.  The service was excellent without being overbearing; especially in light of the fact we were the only diners in the room.   My overall impression is a favorable one. Why this place isn't doing a land office business is beyond my understanding. Give this place a try. The food is worth it.

According to Chow Bella,  Aaron Mays' Praying Monk has closed. RIP. It goes on to report that a BBQ joint is taking over the space. The new people plan to be open in 4-6 wks...  ARRGH!!  Where will I go to get my Cuban sandwich fix??

Had to get my barbecue on today. It was a late lunch and all the close places weren't open and the only open one I know of was just too far to drive. On N 7th Street, I finally found Stacey's.  At one time, I pretty much ran all over Hell's half-acre looking for this place. I tried Indian School Road and a couple of other places in Phoenix that were all FORMER Stacey's BBQ locations. I found the real deal in what looks like a former ice cream stand, next to my computer guy's storefront. There is a God.  Ordered half a slab of spare ribs, cowboy beans, corn bread and diet soda. Not only do they accept cash, now they accept credit cards!! (I hear Handel's "Messiah" in the background) There's VERY limited seating. Even the smoker is outdoors.   I loved everything! The spare ribs had nice rub and good smoke. The sweet bbq sauce was a nice change-of-pace to a tangy sauce that was not very spicy, but had a little kick to it. The cowboy beans are the bbq beans with chopped jalapenos added. A nicely spicy side. Unfortunately, they were out of the corn bread. Diet soda came in a can.  BTW, those of you who complain about the "crunchy bits" in the pulled pork or brisket, that is what is called "bark." It's one of the things that gives GOOD barbecue it's flavor. Do the rest of us a favor, if you don't know what the "crunchy bits" are, STOP COMPLAINING!! Your ignorance of what constitutes "good" barbecue is out there for all of us to see. You deserve the barbecue at Dickey's in Scottsdale. I tried THAT "barbecue" once, but never again.  All in all, I will return with several friends to put them through their paces. However, I was just  happy to find Stacey's "new" location. I will be back

Absolutely the best doughnuts on the planet.   The first step to conquering an addiction is recognizing that you have one. Is there a 12 Step Program for Krispy Kreme's cream-filled glazed doughnuts?

This business is the only McIntosh factory-authorized repair facility in the Phoenix area. I brought a McIntosh MX-112 to the shop. Because of it's age, I was ready to give up on this preamp/tuner and use it as a boat anchor. Cornell was not only able to diagnose the problem, he was able to do the repairs in a timely manner and for the same price as quoted. Needless to say, my 44 yr old Mac sounds fantastic.  He not only works on McIntosh equipment. I brought my 40 yr old Phase Linear 700B to him. He was able to diagnose and repair some longstanding problems and perform some upgrades to the caps that had been recommended by serious audiophiles for a while. Again, he was able to perform the work for what he quoted.  Audio Doctor does a lot of repairs for audio/visual businesses all over the valley. He's open by appointment only. He accepts credit cards.

Nice jazzy vibe. Background music provided by live musicians. Hummus plate is good. Best Chicken Marsala I've had in a long time. Good place to meet for after-work drinks or a date.

The Bacon Board was excellent with a number of thick and thin sliced bacons served with two kinds of relish, melted cheese on toast and whole-grain mustard. The 1/2 slab of ribs were great. The meat was tasty and fell right off the bone.   A sample of the Apple Pie Moonshine was brought over by the bartender. It was a bit sweet and did, indeed, taste like a slice of apple pie. I could easily see how some people would love this concoction.  Service was excellent and prices were reasonable.

A family operation that knows what barbecue is all about. I've eaten here on a number of occasions and have yet to have a bad meal. The elder statesman will be outside conducting tours of the smoker and handing out bottles of water to patrons standing in line. The young pitmaster is inside carving and serving up some of the best Texas barbecue to be had outside of Austin or Longview; not to mention this is the friendliest service I've seen in a long time.  The Upside: The food is phenomenal. Absolutely the best Texas-style barbecue in Phoenix bar none. You need to get here early because Scott only smokes so much and he usually sells out by 1:30pm. But, the beef ribs, when offered, are usually gone by 12;30...  For pork ribs, the meat just falls off the bone. For beef ribs, the cracked pepper rub is the best. The brisket has a nice bark and a smoke flavor that's just outstanding, Having eaten here on several occasions, none of the meats have been dry or anything other than top notch. The sauces are all made in-house.   The sides are also excellent. My favorites are the cole slaw and the barbecue beans. They've recently started offering a pecan pie baked off in the smoker. I can't wait to try this new item. Sorry, guys, I'm not a fan of cheese grits -- no matter what!! (LOL!!) Drinks? Canned and bottled Coke products are offered.   The Downside: They open at 11:00am. If you arrive after 11:30, you'll spend more time waiting on line than you will ordering/eating. Recently, I arrived just before noon and didn't get done eating until almost 2:00pm. The line outside the door, a testament to the quality of the food, is also the real enemy of this place.  If you're handicapped, you're S.O.L. Plan accordingly.  I would have given Little Miss BBQ five stars, but have to knock them down half a star because if you're handicapped or simply can't stand in line for almost an hour it's practically impossible to eat here. There are no phone orders (I tried.) -- unless you order more than five lbs of meat and place your order 48 hrs in advance. However, if you;re willing (or able) to stand in line, it's the best bbq around.

OK, this place has only been open a week. However, if it wants to be known as a "steakhouse," it will be competing with Mastro's, Fleming's, Grill 44 and Ruth's Chris among others. Measured alongside these restaurants, Black & Bleu's management has a lot of work to do.  The menu is a little bit of this and that. It creates the impression that this eatery has an identity crisis. Most steakhouses will bring out a basket of warm bread or rolls. At Black & Bleu, we had to ask for bread THREE times. In the end, we were brought two slices of toasted white sandwich bread more suitable for toast points than anything else -- and with NO butter. All this in a "steakhouse" charging $44 for a 14 oz ribeye and $42 for lamb chops.  The wine list is relatively small and mediocre, There are a number of cabernets and pinot noirs but only one merlot. On the bright side, the barmaids are easy on the eyes and the broiler station knows their stuff. Our flatiron steak and NY Strip came out exactly as we ordered. That said, the Lobster Bisque was scorched and the grilled asparagus was limp. In the restaurant world, it's inexcusable to serve your patrons burned soup.  Service was needlessly slow. The waitstaff does not know the menu. Example: they constantly referred to "crabcakes" when, in fact, the dish was a single crabcake. The entire waitstaff needs to be trained in the basics. Yes, Virginia, diners should be served from the left and plates removed from the right. The waitstaff has yet to master this basic tenet of service. See: www.chefalbrich.com/etiquette/   In sum, the menu needs to be rethought and the staff trained in proper service. Until that time, competing as a "steakhouse" in a market that has so many first-class steakhouses will doom Black & Bleu.

The business practices of this organization are absolutely awful. I paid with my credit card and the head of the crew stated that I would receive an emailed receipt. As of the next morning, it had not shown up in EITHER of the email addresses I provided.  I attempted to call their toll-free number. The call was taken by a nationwide switchboard. They refused to give me the number of their local office. I found a local Phoenix telephone number. The local number forwarded my call to the same nationwide switchboard. After being told I could not speak to anyone in the local office, I threatened to call the AZ Division of Weights and Measures. I was put on hold, Eventually, after hemming and hawing, the operator connected me to what was supposed to be their local office. What I was connected to wasn't an office, it was someone's voice mail.   The service itself was fine. The young men were careful, respectful and courteous. However, their company's business practices are frustrating and leave a lot to be desired. Considering the local Phoenix news of several moving companies getting busted for overcharging customers, withholding customers' property and generally making used car salesmen look good; it's no  wonder that this firm has four stars on Yelp. The bar for this industry is so low that almost any carbon-based lifeform with a truck can call themselves "movers" -- even if they have the business ethics of a cockroach..

I want potential customers of this enterprise to understand that the actual moving services were perfectly fine. The men were careful, considerate and did their job in a workman-like fashion. My problem arose with the fact that I needed a receipt and was unable to contact anyone at the firm when the promised emailed receipt did not arrive. Even more aggravating was the call center's attitude and lack of cooperation.  The local franchisee has since informed me that the practice of the national call center not giving out the local office's phone number has changed. Now, from what the local franchisee has informed me, the local number is available from the national call center.  If I had received the promised emailed receipt or had the national call center given me the local Phoenix phone number, I would have been perfectly happy with this firm's service. The four star rating given is for the actual service by the men who did the work.
