In terms of airports I have to say that the Phoenix airport is pretty up to date... but my god it's huge! Assuming you are in the same terminal as your flight you will be just fine, but if you have to switch terminals you better hustle! There are lots of places to eat and grab a glass of wine and many places to pick up some snacks for your flight. It's easy to navigate and there is free wifi so I'd definitely connect through here given the option!

For Vegas I would say this is one of the quietest places in the city, which is night. It's extremely clean and well maintained and there are a decent amount of places to grab coffee and hook up to the free wifi. We ended up waiting here for a few hours and there was definitely enough to do! I think I ended gambling away a whole $8 ($0.25) slots). What I'm sad about was not taking advantage of the duty free liquor... what a deal! Can't wait to go back to Vegas!!!!!

Disappointed with this hotel. Not only was the carpet stained in our room, but there was an ethernet cord and the wifi almost never worked. First of all.... what's an ethernet cord???????? As I'm from Canada it's costly to have my phone on so I do rely on wireless, the ethernet cord basically made my phone an ipod touch. Baring this the front desk, and room service were extremely unhelpful when we were tying to get a cork screw. They wanted to charge us $3 to have the bottle opened, but wouldn't be able to do it for at least 40 minutes. When we asked if there was a faster way they said that we could go to the restaurant to get it opened, but they wouldn't do it either. The check-in process is extremely slow here, I don't think it has ever taken more than a minute to check in at a hotel, but this process took about 5 and the people kept asking the exact same questions. It's in a good location and the staff are friendly, but that's about it.

A dream come true!!!! This is my favourite breakfast spot in all of Vegas. The portions are huge, so make sure you split them! All of the food is amazing here, although the juice is really pricey., so I just don't pay for it. There can definitely be a really long line to get into this restaurant so go early, or much later in the morning. They do have a ton of tables so the line tends to move quickly! Make sure you try out this breakfast hot spot while in Vegas, you won't be disappointed!

Montreal is one of the prettiest cities in Canada... well that's my opinion anyways. The Biodome was an interesting thing to visit, there were lots of different types of wild life and exhibits which made for an interesting day trip. I would definitely recommend the Biodome to those visiting Montreal but you can do it in less than a day. There were exhibits I wasn't all that interested in but to each there own, there were still tons of great things to check out. The annoying thing was however that student prices could only be used if you were a resident of Quebec, which I think is a bit silly.

This little place is nestled in the heart of Montreal to pick up some delicious sushi or a quiet night in. The restaurant was beautiful and quaint I enjoyed a nice glass of white wine while I waited for my order. This place could be from France, it's small and lovely, the staff are friendly and they are wonderful at what they do. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area, and even though I was a couple blocks away it was definitely worth the wait!

This airport can be defined as a hot mess. Nothing seemed to go right or on time during my visit here. My luggage was extremely late coming to the carousel and the security lines were extremely long and the staff not very friendly. I'd avoid flying through this airport again.

Hooray for Canada having some decent rail transit between Canadian cities. I really enjoyed taking this transportation. The cabins were clean and the wifi worked well. The staff were very pleasant and the train was right on time. Boarding was very easy and the station had quite a few coffee shops around to grab a quick breakfast before boarding. Overall I was very impressed with the easy navigation and great service from Via Rail. I wish more of Canada had quick trains between large Canadian cities!

Sushi Roku is pricey and I'll lead with that because it's probably the worst thing about the restaurant. Once you get over the price the experience goes up from here, I love how trendy this place is, and they have a fantastic selection for sushi as well as wine. The staff are pretty friendly, although the one staff member I dealt with didn't know a lot about the wines on the menu so that was a little frustrating. All in all the location is great, the food was delicious and the experience I had was great. Would I do it again, absolutely!

Well I have to say that this little boutique bridal store will always hold a place in my heart. This is where I found my wedding dress and I have to say I'm completely smitten by it. As a Canadian I found it very challenging to find anything that wasn't pouffy and strapless which is exactly what I didn't wanter. I searched high and low (thanks pinterest) for many brands that I though had attractive dresses but couldn't find any near where I lived. Enter Mariée.  I walked into this store and was overcome with joy. There are probably 4-5 dresses in this store at any given time that could have been my wedding dress. I know they say many designers in small boutiques are so expensive but I thought there was a variety of price ranges in this store and I happily found my dream gown just a tiny bit over my budget.  The staff at this store are amazing, they are all lovely people and many of them are brides themselves. They know what dresses will look good and how to ensure you are picking a gown that looks good on you.   Additionally, since I'm a Canadian, once I picked my dress and veil I needed to have them shipped up to my home! Mariée was amazing at working with UPS to ensure my gown and veil made it to the location I needed in a very reasonable amount of time. I'm so thankful for the ladies at Mariée as without them I never would have found this dress. My dress is completely different and like nothing I've ever seen before and I'm completely infatuated by it!   I can't believe I said "yes to the dress"!

This place was so fun and very trendy, I did a lot of travelling this summer and I would have to say this was one of my favorite stops! This place is hidden so if you don't have a local bring you, then you're out of luck. You have to climb a couple sets of stairs to get into the club but once you're in there are tons of places to sit! The vibe is eclectic and hipster and all the people are just there to have fun! The pitchers of mojitos is where it's at, and you should definitely go with a group, you'll have so much fun!!!

Do not use this company. This was by far the worst I have been treated by a company. My sister and best friend booked a limo for my stagette and the limo company was 2 hours late picking us up. The driver was apologetic but came with an empty tank of gas. Further when they were supposed to pick us up they ended up not showing. We asked for a refund and so far they have said no, we are now having this company investigated and put a hold on the Visa charge.
