Saigon is by far my favorite pho stop. I come here every time I'm back home in Phoenix or when I am craving some hot soupy noodles.   I almost always order the same thing when I come here: the spring rolls, a pho tai (#12), and a combination 3 bean drink. The spring rolls are perfectly crispy and go very well wrapped in the big lettuce leaves they come with and dipped in the fish sauce on the side. The meat in the pho comes in very thin slices that finish cooking in your soup at the table - yum! (I love adding sriracha and hoisin sauce to my bowl as well for added spice and flavor) The bean drink is cold and refreshing, and a sweet addition to the meal.   I would recommend Saigon to any pho lover or anyone looking for warm soup on a sick day. The pho is authentic and delicious, as well as the other dishes that I've tried here!

My friend and I had a feast when we came to Zinburger. They have a solid menu of burgers to choose from, and their shakes are delicious!   We ordered the zucchini fries that came with ranch and parmesan, and I really enjoyed them. They were perfectly crispy on the outside, but soft and juicy on the inside. We also had the diablo burgers, which were definitely spicy, but the jalapeños added a nice flavor to the burgers. The buns were fluffy and sweet, but very filling (I only ate the bottom bun).  For dessert, we had the cookies and cream shake. You can never go wrong with oreo milkshakes, and this one was no exception! They had crunchy oreos blended into the ice cream, and light whipped cream on top -- YUM!   Overall, Zinburger is a great place to grab a burger and shake and people watch in the Biltmore! (Keep in mind, the dress code is nice casual! My friend and I came here in workout clothes after a hike, and were pretty underdressed. Ooops!)

Seasons 52 never disappoints! This is one of my family's go-to restaurants for a solid (and healthy!) meal. I LOVE that they change their menu every week to make sure they're serving what is fresh and in season at the time (hence the 52 in their name). All of their dishes are less than 475 calories, which is great for people who are watching their calories or be more aware of what they eat.  We usually split a flatbread for the 5 of us - try the Chicken Pesto - and then get an entree for each person. Since the portions are smaller, it's easy to share dishes and try different orders. I love their honey and herb half chicken breast for the entree, it's tender, juicy, and goes well with the vegetables. (My sister also loves the caramelized scallops, but I've never tried them)  Always save room for their mini indulgences!! They're desserts in a shot glass, and the perfect size for a sweet treat at the end of a good meal. We usually pass them around the table so everyone gets a bite of each! My favorites are the carrot cake, key lime pie, and pecan pie.   If you love fresh ingredients and delicious flavors, definitely check out Seasons 52. They have healthy options, yummy desserts, and a great environment for family dinners.

I only had delivery, so I can't say much about their service nor restaurant vibe, but I really enjoyed their food!  I ordered the roasted cauliflower, which was literally an entire head of roasted cauliflower. It was awesome. Usually restaurants give you tiny pieces of the flower, which are too small for me to appreciate. This cauliflower was huge and I could cut it to my liking and fully enjoy the roasted flavor. The garlic mashed potatoes were also tasty and smooth! I wasn't a huge fan of their salad, their dressing was a little too sour, but I also wasn't too hungry after the other two items of the meal.   I would definitely return here to try one of their sandwiches, or for another cauliflower. I also had their cowgirl cookie which was YUMMY! (and free cookie with Yelp Checkin!!)

Uncle Bear's was great for a quick afternoon lunch. I was a fan of their dog-themed restaurant (dog pictures everywhere on their walls), and their efficient service.   The food comes in pretty decent portions, we ordered two entrees which had enough food to serve all 4 of us in our party (although we were not too hungry). I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries, and really enjoyed the sandwich. Pulled pork is my favorite, and they have a good combo of pulled pork, BBQ sauce, cole slaw, and fried onions on theirs. The fries were decent and on the greasier side.  I also had a bite of the prime rib sliders, which were pretty yummy!  It wasn't my favorite lunch, but it was good for a sandwich and a quick eat in the middle of the day.

Loved the environment at The Henry! They have a cozy space with lots of vintage decorations, and friendly staff that makes you feel at home once you arrive. All of the items on their menu have solid flavor combinations that made choosing just one a challenge.   We ended up with the short rib potstickers, which were delicious (super tender meat filling!) but also a little pricier compared to other appetizers. I also split the Roasted Turkey French Dip with a side of Kale and Apple Slaw. I wasn't a fan of the kale slaw, but the sandwich was fantastic, especially with the jus for dipping. I loved the kick from the horseradish too!  For dessert, we had the bread pudding, which was huge! Definitely big enough for the table to share (we had two people and couldn't finish), and had a great fluffy texture!   I don't know how I had never been to The Henry before, but I will definitely be back!

Kneaders is a solid spot for sandwiches! I would have preferred if the overhead menu had more details about what is in each sandwich, but they have a smaller menu if you ask for more information.   The sandwiches are very hearty and filling. I could only eat half the sandwich before I was too full. We ordered the French dip with caramelized onions and the turkey artichoke on focaccia. Both were very tasty, but I wish their bread was thinner. I felt like the sandwiches were overwhelmed by the thick slices of bread. I also tried the razzleberry berry smoothie, which was good but a little too sweet.   Otherwise, the sandwiches and smoothies at Kneaders are flavorful and a make good full meal.

I love the Nekter franchise, and this location didn't disappoint! The store itself was clean and had lots of fresh fruit and vegetables on display.  My açai banana berry bowl was smooth and refreshing, just what I was looking for on a hot Phoenix day! They also had a good balance of açai to granola.   I would definitely recommend a Nekter bowl for a healthy, cold snack!

Last weekend, I visited my hometown of Phoenix, and I was pleasantly surprised to see how many new boba places have popped up in Phoenix recently. However, the Boba Tea Company has lots of room for improvement before it joins the ranks of my go-to boba places in AZ.  For one, their menu is really complicated, which makes it difficult to understand what you're actually ordering. They have a really creative menu (drink names, size names) that is unique and exciting. But their listing of ingredients like "white" and "cream" and categories of Bottoms, Sidekicks, and Moomi, the whole process of ordering was very confusing and misleading.  In terms of their product, the boba has good consistency but the drinks were WAY too sweet for me. I tried the small Geisha (matcha with almond creamer substituting for half/half) my mom had the Honeysuckle, both were good but overwhelmingly sweet. The ratio of boba to tea to ice was also very uneven, which left me with watery tea and a ton of boba long after my tea was gone.   Boba Tea Co has potential to become a much better place due to their wide variety of options and creativity. That being said, I felt extremely rushed to order, but didn't even know what I was getting because of their complicated menu. The staff was not very helpful either, as they also seemed confused about the menu. I hope to see the changes that it makes in the future!

So glad my friend introduced me to MAD greens! Their salads are super fresh and super filling. I had the MAD Molly Brown with kale instead of spinach, and I'd definitely recommend! The grilled onions were a great touch to the salad. My friend and I raved about how the tomatoes were sweeter and juicier than most other tomatoes we've had (can't tell if we owe that to them being locally grown).  However, I wasn't a big fan of their Southwestern Chicken. It was rather dry and flavorless, so I'd add a different meat next time. I also was a little confused that a "BIG" salad means they add more of the base greens (spinach, kale, mixed greens), but keep the toppings and add-ons the same. If we're paying for a larger salad, I would think they'd add more of everything and not just the lettuces.   Either way, MAD greens has tasty, and fresh, locally-sourced salads. I had the Spicy Sriracha Almond Vinaigrette and it was AMAZING -- so much better than the suggested Sherry Molasses Vinaigrette. Definitely try the Sriracha one!!
