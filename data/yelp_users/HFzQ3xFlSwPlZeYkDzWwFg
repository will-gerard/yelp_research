I stayed here during the summer really enjoyed it. Got the cheapest room and it was HUGE! Centrally located which was nice right next to the mall! I would definitly stay here again!

Went to Saks over the summer couldnt get help from anyone yet it wasnt busy. If you dont look like a million bucks dont run inside here! They wouldnt throw fire on your burning body!

Oh my gosh....I am sitting in my hotel room right now and want to SCREAM.   I am paying 275.00 a night for the Presidential Suite which is very large but oh so very outdated. The fixtures are all from the late 80's how i know is because there from the same year I was born! Its horrible! The Spa was full of spiders and orange....pretty sure it was white at one point. All the fixtures in the "wet bar" are like a Taupe/Pink/Mauve and are squeaking soooooo loud right now! I feel like I'm on the set of Pretty Women urgggg I hated that time period! This place could be GREAT if they did some updates!   Since its Thanksgiving no one is working and the High Class much praised kitchen is closed! At the friggin Hilton its closed! I could have stayed at the Ritz Carlton for less down the street but since my grandfathers High School reunion is here we figured why not....Cant be that bad I mean for crying out loud I'm used to Motel 6!   This is pretty bad!   However what staff they have left down there is pretty nice!
