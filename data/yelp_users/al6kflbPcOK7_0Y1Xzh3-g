I went to this office because of their in-house financing and its proximity to my home. I have heard bad things about Western Dental but, with the amount of work I needed I thought it would be worth it. Contrary to the rumors I received EXCELLENT service. Yes, the staff seemed young BUT every one of them put forth the best effort. I have been there 4 times in the past 2 weeks and have never sat in the lobby more than 10 minutes. Dr. Patel was one of the kindest dentists I have ever met. Dr. People did all my extensive dental work, it took him 2 hours even though it was only supposed to take 1 and he NEVER seemed rushed about it. He was patient through everything and was COMPLETLY thorough. I never have felt more at ease with a dentist. I was terrified of the dentist before this. I now would not go ANYWHERE else.

I wish I could give a review here about the actual service I received from this company. But unfortunately, in multiple attempts to contact this company for a service they advertise to offer, I never received a response.  Not a single response, in over 10 days. I have called and emailed.  The Wrapped Shoppe advertises they do Vinyl Wraps for "Doc Bands" they are Medical Cranial Molding Devices for infants with Plagiocephaly and Bracyocephaly in addition to other medical conditions. My 4 month old is stuck in one of these for a few months because the way he was stuck in my belly. He has some minor cranial and facial misalignment and deformations. These "wraps" are applied to these devices because most people don't know what these are for so they stare...and every one feels uncomfortable... and they look cute. Yes, I know it's not important.  But if your baby wore a helmet 23 hours a day you would understand.    The Wrap Shoppe, I understand a 4 month old baby, and the $150 you were going to make off us 1x make not take precedence over your normal day to day operations.  But we at least deserved some sort of response. We are just like everyone else. A paying customer.   From what I have understood from other parents at my sons doctors office, this isn't the first time you have done something like this. It isn't nice to continue to advertise a service you are not interested in completing.
