knowledge of the people in this store is hit or miss...  I stopped in because my pool motor is making a racket.  I had a picture of the label, showed them it's a 3/4 hp motor.  it either needs a rebuild or replacement  they don't do rebuilds, so I ask for a price on a replacement.  the guy brings out a 2 hp motor... and quotes me something like $450.   he was pretty clueless, asking me what type of motor I wanted.  umm... I showed you what I've got, why wouldn't you be able to tell me what I need to replace it?  I sure don't need a 2hp motor to replace a 3/4 hp.  I know two-speed motors can be used in place of my single-speed and they're more efficient, so I ask him about that.  He has to call a guy at another store to figure out what I need and how much it is.  like I said, hit or miss...

Have had nothing but friendly and professional care at Countryside. you can definitely tell the staff are all animal lovers.  Had to put down my 15 yo black lab and the compassionate people here made it a peaceful experience, much better than I expected.  I've since taken my Labradoodle there and even though he's a bit of a nervous nellie, they are able to do all examinations thoroughly and with care.

Popped in here mid-afternoon when i was in the area.  It's a nice, casual, locally-owned pizza joint.  They have a number of tvs to catch a game, but only half of them are flat screen.  Music is fairly loud for a restaurant.  They have tasty thin crust pizza, and they will serve by the slice for just a couple bucks.  Basic beer and wine selection, but they do have blue moon & sam adams on tap.  Friendly service and pretty good prices.  Would be a good place to  go catch a game or have dinner with the family.

I know lots of people go to Four Peaks for their brews, and they are great. But every meal I've had there has been super tasty too.  I often have the daily specials, cause they usually sound so good.  The Sweet Jalapeno dressing on the spinach salad is fantastic!  Sitting on the patio is awesome and even sitting just inside the  huge garage door is great because it's so open and bright you  feel like you're outside.  If you can get there in October, the Pumpkin Porter is a really good seasonal brew.  So yeah, they can get busy, sometimes you gotta wait and the parking  can be a pain.  That's what happens when you've got a cool place with tasty brews and good food...

What a cool authentic setting that greets you upon walking into the outdoor patio filled with over 100 plants.  Lots of open beam wood work gives it a rustic but classy setting.  We had a group of about 15 and the service was very good.  My food was great and as far as I know everyone in our group had a great meal

Right off the bat when you pull up to Cibo, you get the feeling that this will be a different experience.  It's located in a what looks like a residential neighborhood, with older nicely kept homes around it.    They have a very nice patio with a cool ambiance to it, right off the street but not noisy. And lots of heaters on the patio.  The inside of the place is really cool as it's an old bungalow house, with very few apparent modifications, so it retains the original charm.  Service was very good, with great knowledge of the menu and ingredients, since there were definitely some things on the menu I didn't know about.  The server was attentive, but not overly so.  Given their menu, I think they're aware that people often have take a bit longer to decide what to order.  And of course the food..  Awesome antipasto, fresh ingredients, a REAL Italian menu.  This would be a good place to bring people from out of town to show them we have some cool ambiance and great food right in central Phoenix.

Burgers are lame and dry, which is kind of a problem considering this is a burgers and malts place.  We ordered a combo with ($12) fries and asked if we could substitute onion rings.  "Sure" said our server, but when the bill came we were charged an extra $1.10...   and the onion rings were kinda soft, not crunchy on the outside.  The combo also came with a drink and we asked to substitute a malt.  Same response "Sure", but again an additional charge of over $2.    I guess our server doesn't understand that it's common practice to let your customer know when there will be an additional charge for a substitution...  Malts are pretty good and it's the only thing that gets this place two stars  I feel like this location gets people by default being right next to jobing.com arena, but they don't really cater to repeat customers like a local restaurant, which means they don't go out of their way to satisfy you.

Definitely a place to get your sushi fix.  Yes, you can find better sushi in Tempe/Chandler, but Teharu is good sushi at great prices.

another thing I like about Teharu.  If you're trying to get some sushi on the quick, here you can sit down, order up a drink and start grabbing plates.    and if you're feeling adventurous and want to try something new, you only spending $1-3 per plate.

Nice decor, like the wooden tables and chairs.  Not really a "rustic" setting, more bright and comfortable with lots of natural light and colored ceramic tiles on the walls.  Big breakfast menu and it's served all day.  Think the owner is in the kitchen, which is usually a good sign.  Pizza is good it's all made using pita bread.  good sized portions, good food, friendly service and reasonable prices.

quick qualifier, I didn't choose to go here, the soccer team manager did... the whole soccer team went between tournament games at Reach 11.  Ok - first know that at Culvers you're getting fairly greasy fast food type stuff  like burgers & fries.  They are known for their burgers & custard.  Didn't have either of those  but my sons gave the burgers a 3.5.  Fries were krinkle cut, very average.  I had the Reuben, pretty good, but the sauerkraut was pretty bland. Probably  the healthiest sandwich on the menu besides the grilled chicken.  Unlike McD's, they have competent people who work there.   And I like that they bring your order to your table, so you're not stumbling around waiting by the counter.  So definitely a step above all the big fast food chains with prices that are just a tad (I think...) more.

Well, if you liked this place when it was Picazzo's then you'll like it now.  Pretty much everything is the same - the setting, menu (still using local, organic ingredients), gluten free options, etc.  AND they still have the Puttanesca pizza!!  (Just found out that "Spaghetti alla puttanesca"  literally translates to "whore's style spaghetti" in Italian...)  This place actually switched ownership and continued under the Picazzo's name for about 9 months before the name change to Buon Gusto.  Decent beer selection with Santan Brewing on tap, which is cool, wish they also had Four Peaks....   This next part is from my 12 YO son, who drafted it on my phone while at the restaurant. He was pretty happy after having some cheese bread, pizza and the chocolate brownie with vanilla bean ice cream  : )  Vary Nice menu. Good service with nice waiters and waitresses. Smells amazing and fresh. Locally sourced organic ingredients.  BEST FOOD IN TEMPE!!
