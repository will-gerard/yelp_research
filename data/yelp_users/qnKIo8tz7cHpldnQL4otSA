We ate here on Mothers Day at the Morning Glory Cafe. Our food was great. Everyone in our group cleared their plates. I had the Juevos Rancheros and it did not dissapoint. I also tried the French toast and the sausage gravy. Everything amazing. We had good service too!  We got lucky and were seated in the shade.  The only part I didnt like was that it was up to us to find out own high chair and we could only find 2 in the entire resturant and they were in use.  I think the staff should find the high chair, especially since when we made a reservation, we said we needed 2.

This place was really good. The hamburgers look amazing. I had a chili dog and it was also amazing.  The chili was really good. We tried lemon meringue, pumpkin and chocolate cream. All were good but the lemon meringue was off the charts. This place is kind of a dive but if you are looking for affordable home made food this place is good.

The only reason this gets 2 stars is because my kids love this place. The pizza is Terrible. The games pretty crappy and run down many of them not working properly.  Why can't places for kids serve better quality food?

I love getting facials here!  Loretta is the owner and she is an amazing aesthetician.  She does a ton of other services as well and she is amazing at what she does.  She has removed skin tags, moles.  She is no nonsense and isnt trying to sell you a million products.  This is just the best place to go if you want treatment oriented skin care.

I love this place. This is the best pizza in Mesa. I have been eating here since they were in the old location for the last 20 years. I was sad when they closed and so happy they reopened just behind the old place.

Love this place!!  We get take out here all the time!  I love their hummus. It's super smooth served with olive oil and an olive. Their tzatziki sauce is really thick and creamy. My favorite is the falafel pita. Soo good. Their pita is yummy.

I love this place!  The atmosphere is not as hip as other sushi places in town but they make it up with great service and great food.   Its also very family friendly, we have been bringing our kids here since they were babies.  If you order saki and ask for the special cups, they will bring you these funny cups that when saki is poured into the them and you look into it you see a naked lady!  Cracks us up!!

I just went to Hair Do for the first time yesterday and I was sold.  Brandy did my hair and she did a great job.  I was so happy to get the hair cut for half price since I was a first time guest.  I will definitely be back.  The only drawback I saw was that things seemed cluttered and even dirty in some areas.  i dont think they dust very often at all.  Other than that, it was a good experience.

This place is sooooooo good!  And it shows because you have to get there early if you dont want to wait 2 hrs for a table.  Luckily they have a really nice wine bar next door that you can wait in.

I recently ran over a nail and had that stuck in my tire.  I brought it in to Discount Tire because they will fix it for free if its safe.  Well it wasnt safe, they told me that my 2 front tires were completely shot and that it was not safe to drive off the lot.  The tires were almost $200 each and I told the nice guy helping me (Steve) that I couldnt even really afford 1 tire right now.  He left the counter for a few minutes and came back and told me that he would be willing to give me both tires for the price of 1 and let me do an IOU for the other tire to come pay for that when I replace my other tires.  He said he saw me there with my kids and he really wanted to help me get my car into a safer position.  I was so touched that I got choked up and had tears running down my  face.  It was such a nice thing for him to do for me.  Thank you Steve and Discount Tire, you really made my day and helped me out so much!!

I came here one time years ago and was not very impressed.  I decided to give it another shot today for lunch.  I walked in and they had done some remodeling.  It looked nicer and was a nicer sit down type place now instead of a place where you order at a counter.  I ordered Kung Pao Chicken lunch special which comes with a spring roll and 2 crab wontons.  Well they forgot my spring roll and crab wontons, but the sweet and sour sauce was there.  I was really disappointed!  I didnt realize until I got the food home and I wasnt about to go back for that stuff.  2 stars because my kung pao chicken was ok, veggies werent over cooked.  Could have used more flavor and the sauce was pretty thick and gummy.  I wont be back.

I love this store!  They always have everything I need.  Every time I go in there are a bunch of people working and looking to help me out and find whatever I need.  I choose this store over Home Depot any day.  No hunting around for an employee to help you out.  Plus, they give away free popcorn, you cant beat that!!

I love this place!  Ive been shopping here for 4 years and its grown and expanded a lot!  Bertha offers everything I need for my small waxing and eyelash studio.  She is always there and always helpful and talkative.  I also took the Eyelash Extension class here and  I really enjoyed it!  Thanks!

This is a great place to get a very inexpensive facial.  I love the product lines they use, Hylunia and Rhonda Allison.

I had a good time here with my kids. It was busy on a weekday. Get there right when it opens if you want to snag a shady spot.

It was ok.  We were happy to be able to get into a nice place for Father's Day with no reservation.  The brunch was great for adults.  All of us enjoyed our food but things were lacking for the kids.  They only had 1 item for kids, french toast.  My older son ordered a giant belgium waffle and I was dissappointed that it was only a waffle on a plate.  No butter, whipped cream, garnish...nothing to make it special.  They had no crayons or anything to entertain the kids.  I just figured it would be a bit more kid friendly.  I will go back, but not with kids.

Ive had dinner here several times and its mediocre Mexican at best.  The beans taste like they come out of a can.  I do like their chips, light and crispy and the salsa is ok.  I would probably give this place 3 stars if it was just based on the dinner restaurant.  Today we decided to try out their breakfast for the first time.  I was impressed walking into the breakfast cafe, as I didnt expect it to be its own little restaurant.  We stood next to another family that had already been waiting.  We stood there for more than 5 minutes and none of the 4 employees we saw would acknowledge us.  They kept glancing our way and continuing what they were doing.  I asked the family who had been waiting longer than us if anyone had helped them and they said no!  So I went up to the bar and still everyone was too busy to talk to me.  Finally I was able to ask someone if we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated.  They said to seat ourselves.  So we ended up letting the other family take the only available clean table and we continued to stand there with no greeting or acknowledgement from any of the staff.  Dirty tables everywhere that needed to be cleaned.  We walked out. What kind of customer service is that?  We stood there for a very long time!  I was excited to try out the breakfast here but I will not be going back.

Amazing food!  The Pad Thai was perfect!  If you are planning to eat here before a show at the Mesa Arts Center then make sure you get a reservation because this place gets packed!

I e been eating at Someburros for almost 20 years. I've been to all their locations and the food is always great!  I love their hot sauce and chips. I also love that they switched to real dishes and ditched the styrofoam and Plastic. Much more green!

I loved this place!  We were looking for a tortoise for our son and had gone to several other places like Petsmart and Petco.  We decided to try out this little place and were so glad we did!  Kirsten helped us and she was so knowledgeable about the tortoises and gave me so much information.  She showed us how to soak them and feed them and what is healthy on them  and what to look for if they show signs of sickness.  It was very clean.  I read the other review where it says she didnt think the reptiles were well taken care of.  I saw the opposite.  It was like all the animals were her babies and she cared for their well being.  She had her back door open with some cages set up in the doorway just letting those animals bask in the real sunlight.  The tortoise we got is 3 months old and was bred right there in the store. I like knowing where my pet came from and knowing they are born locally and not shipping from some other place.  I know that I will be able to use this place as a resource for anytime I have questions about our tortoises and what they need.  We will definitely be loyal customers.

I had my nails done by Lisa for the first time today and I was not disappointed.  I am a pretty extreme nail biter and it was the first time someone didnt just try to glue tips to my nails that were bitten down halfway down the nail bed.  Instead she built a nail up with acrylic and they will grow out to look natural like my real nails.  Im very excited about how they look.  Lisa's place is so cute too!  Its a fun happy atmosphere.  Never going back to the cheapy nail salons.  You really do get what you pay for and to be honest, my nails werent that much more than Id pay for a full set at other places.

I have had a great experience here.  Ive been going to EWC since March 2011 and I have had several different services with several different waxers.  All have exceeded my expectations.  The front desk has been friendly and helpful, the waxers I have seen have all been professional and good at what they do.  The store is clean and modern.  My favorite service is the brazilian.  Audra has made is as pain free as possible and not awkward at all.  They have great prices as well!

The food here is really good!  I had the ceviche tostadas and rice and beans and I ate every bite!  The chips are home made and yummy. Overall I want to try a million things on the menu. Big menu too lots of Baja style seafood!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the service was slow and lacking. We stood at the door for 5 min and no one told us to seat ourselves even though staff walked past us several times without saying anything. Our waitress took forever. We were there nearly 2 hrs for lunch. Then had to wait 15 min for the waitress to bring our check after we already told her we were done. The prices are good. And their lunch combos are only $5.99

If you drive a Honda, this is the place to get it fixed.  I plan to only drive hondas just so I can continue to come here.  This place has saved me soooo much money.  They are honest and they do exactly what you need and not a thing more.

I had a virus on my computer that made it so I couldnt even start it up.  I called Drew and he happened to be close to my neighborhood so he came and picked up my computer.  I was able to pick it up the next day.  He charged me $56, which I thought was a very good deal.  My computer is running fine now and he even installed an anti virus program for free and also repaired my power cable for free too.  I would definitely recommend Reboot to my friends and family.

I've had breakfast here 3 times now. I love the bar with options like mimosas or Bloody Mary. Their eggs Benedict is great. I had biscuits and gravy this time. It tasted good but wasn't very hot. I asked for a side of gravy and that was hot so it made my meal better. I order sausage on the side. It was barely browned at all so I only had a bite. Next time I will just ask for extra browned sausage. We had good service!  I'd definitely go again and again.

I loved this place!  I took my kids here today. We had cheddar and milk chocolate fondue with all kinds of sweet and savory dippers. This is a unique concept and it's affordable and the people who run it are really friendly!  I will definitely return!

Foxy Faces is so cute!  Very calming vibe.  I was nervous about getting waxed but Sarah really put me at ease.  She knows what she is doing and was able to make me feel comfortable.  I have been to several other places and really feel Sarah gives the best Brazilian wax in Glendale, AZ.  I will definitely be a regular from now on!

I had such a great experience at Skintopia.  Lorrie sugared my legs and did a dermaplane service on my face.  She did such a great job!  She really knows a lot about skin care and was  so nice and easy going.  I will definitely make the drive to Scottsdale to see her again.  Thanks so much for a great experience!

I gave 5 stars because the food is top notch. Fresh, made from scratch everything!  The falafel is the best I've ever had!  Homemade pita, tzaziki sauce. And their baklava is melt in your mouth!  They did forget the pickles I asked to add to my sandwich. Otherwise amazing food and service. Plus they deliver so i will definitely be eating this food again and again!

The Pho was really good!  The thin sliced steak was very lean and not fatty at all. We also tried the fresh spring rolls and they were also very good.  I am so happy to have Pho on this side of town. It's really a great value.
