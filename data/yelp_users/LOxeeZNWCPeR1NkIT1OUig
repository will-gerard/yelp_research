My cousin was in town last week and we picked somewhere we both hadn't been, we had a lovely evening! The white Sangria hit the spot, the food was delicious, the atmosphere was great, the live music was nice background noise and our server Alex was fantastic (Seriously. Super attentive, gave great advise and had a big, beautiful smile!)!!! I loved the New Mexico decor and vibe, would definitley dine here again!

Stopped in with a friend on the weekend - she's a regular, I was a first timer- we both got toasted sandwiches on the garlic loaf. Not only was it under 5$ for the two of us to have lunch but I think it was the best bread I have ever had in my life! Bread and I aren't usually friends, but I didn't feel sick after eating my fluffy, fresh, delicious sandwich! Go check it out!

My absolute favorite Mexican restaurant in Arizona! The prickly pear margaritas are seductive and delicious, the pollo fundidio is to die for, the atmosphere and ambiance are lovely and the service is always good. Any out of town/country visitors that come to stay with me get to experience El Encanto and they all still rave about it. There's often a wait in the evenings on weekends but you can hang out and have a drink at the bar, I always choose to drive out to Cave Creek because I think it's a cool little spot and enjoy the character. Would highly recommend this restaurant.

Two words... Jalapeno Hollandaise!  Dark and mysterious on the inside, good service, great food.

With the only exception of walking through the door to end my membership, I will never again set foot in another massage envy location. The employees care more about trying to sell you products than providing a good service. I've had four massages and one facial and none were memorable experiences. The cherry on top of my dissatisfaction was the horrible experience I just had with management. Darren's attitude, inability to listen and lack of empathy really sours the rest of the lovely reception staff. He was rude, insensitive and unhelpful. Unfortunately, I've had to call customer service and the corporate office to report him and resolve the issue. Don't waste your time or money with this chain.

Happy hour is always a good time. I just wanted to give a shout out to our lovely waitress Mckenna- she was a sweetheart and made our dining experience that much better!

I've been to oceans for many years but haven't been in for a little while, I went in for a pedicure yesterday and saw Long. She was fantastic! Very sweet and friendly and gave me one of the best pedicures I've ever had. I'll be requesting her from now on. Thank you, Long! My feet are so pretty and happy :)

Dr G is fantastic. I've been seeing him for years and would highly recommend him to anyone who is looking for a new chiropractor or anyone who is thinking about chiropractic for the first time. Lovely clinic, friendly reception staff, excellent chiropractic care. Dr G is my first point of protocol when I am sick or injured and I always leave feeling better!

I've been going here for over a year, every visit I am greeted with a smile and a conversation which goes really nicely with the fantastic coffee they whip up. I am from Australia originally and I have brought many Aussie visitors to 32 SHEA and they loved it. I will often get texts messages saying how they wish we could go grab an iced Nutella Mocha on the weekends! I love supporting non chain small businesses and 32 Shea is probably my favourite one to support in the Valley! :)

Stopped in for breakfast with some girlfriends last Saturday after reading so many great reviews, we were not disappointed! The cold brew was life changing and we all enjoyed our meals. Very cute spot, great to see a small business thriving amongst large chain restaurants. We arrived just before 9am and that was perfect timing, this place fills up! All staff were friendly and helpful and the patio is dog friendly. I will definitely be coming back! :)

My friend and I had breakfast and mimosas yesterday to celebrate her 21st birthday, the food and the drinks were fantastic. Our waitress (Liz I think her name was) was a sweetheart and very helpful and even surprised us with a complimentary birthday pancake for the birthday girl! I will definitely be coming back. Also, the playlist was epic. We had a Britney Spears dance party in the bathroom :)

Fantastic, funky salon. All the staff are super accommodating and friendly, and for whatever reason the cucumber water just tastes better here! Nikki does my hair and she is an artist and has become a dear friend. I always leave feeling like a million bucks! :)

Best vintage store in Arizona. The staff are SO wonderful, they know me by name and make me feel right at home when I come in.I have bought four pieces of furniture, a lamp and countless gifts from 3VC and just adore their stuff. Every month they host an open house event called "chicks night out" and there's always snacks and wine and sales. It's such a good time. If you haven't been, go check it out!

One of my fave breakfast/brunch spots in the Valley! The Red Velvet French Toast was a religious experience. The wait time can be lengthy on a weekend but it's worth the wait.

Have been to Culinary Dropout/ The yard a few times and haven't had a bad experience yet. The staff are friendly and attentive and the food/drinks are good. Nice atmosphere and pretty cool that you can play cornhole and table tennis etc. My brother and my best friend were in town from Australia and raved about the pretzel bites!

While the pad Thai was tasty, the service ruined the meal. We were not welcomed by anyone and there was no assistance about the menu or the restaurant offered. I brought my mom here while she was visiting from Australia... McDonald's would have been a better choice. I'll never eat here again!!!
