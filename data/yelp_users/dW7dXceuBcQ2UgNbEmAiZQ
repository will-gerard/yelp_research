My favorite thing to do! Coffee and Caribou! Yes it IS the best. free WIFI- nice and roomy and a great staff. Mike and I enjoyed a small but comfy couch while we talked and drank our favorites. Love it!

Enjoyed a show here for the first time. Very clean and comfortable. Professional and worth going to. Only issue was parking and paying for parking, which I hate.  Otherwise I love the setup and graduated steps so if someone in front of me is too tall, I can still see the show. First visit here but Won't be the last.

What a dump! You would expect renovations after 50 years of being in business. I am only 5 feet tall and my knees hit the chair ahead of me and the rows are too close together so with someone in front of me I couldn't even see. More women then restrooms and dirty. If you want to get into your seat and you are in the middle expect the whole row to have to exit to let you in. It's insane how tightly packed in the people are. Drink and snack prices are hefty!!!  Unless it's someone I really really want to see we won't be back.  PS: my seat was even held together with some tape and once we moved to a different seat in an empty row others took our lead and looked for something less confining.

This is the largest Starbucks I have even been into. The staff was friendly. There is even an outside area. My only problem was a parking problem.

I like Rays pizza not only is it NY style but it's perfectly cooked and not soggy. It's easy to order for pickup or dine in.  Our favorite is the white pizza. Very flavorful and does not require anything else added to it. The garlic bread is also very good and I would say this is our go to place for authentic NY style. The prices are reasonable and the service is always good. A plus is they sell slices also and have small individual sizes as well.

Not happy with this cleaner at all. Prices are outrageous and everything comes back looking minimally better then when it left. I brought in a comforter and for $40 it came back looking exactly the same. A shirt and dress cost $15.00 and it isn't even pressed plus the shirt has is discoloration at the neckline. No quality, no discounts and no more customer here.

Hubby ran in for what was supposed to be a quick trip for bagels to go. While I sat in the parking lot I didn't note how long I waited, but it was longer then usual and hubby confirmed the long wait inside. The pumpkin bagels didn't seem fresh, and had waaaay too much cream cheese to the point where globs and globs were dropping out of them onto our shirts. Don't think I will go back as there are too many options out there and a bagel is easy enough to make perfect.

We were very impressed with the decor, service and burgers here. The fries (unlimited) are as good if not better then McDonald's which says a lot! Be sure to try their secret spice on everything you eat. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. They have indoor seating and outdoor seating. Near the AMC theater.

We had a great experience here from start to finish. The service was exceptional and we tried one of their specialty pastas that had prosciutto, Spicy sausage and ricotta cheese. We shared a small and had leftovers for dinner the next day. Garlic bread rounded out our meal and unfortunately had no room for dessert though it looked wonderful as well.  Love the warmth and decor of this place and hope to return sometime soon.

What a cute place this is and I would suggest for children or train fans this is a must see. Bring your out of town guests here for sure. There is a carousel and two train rides were running around the park. Cute for kids and adults. The train museum is well worth the visit and informational and the guide was very good. I took some great photos as well but with my regular camera. Picnic tables and a snack bar and grassy areas, it's a great place to spend some time!

Have been to two shows here each In a different room and love it. Makes me feel at home with great performances and charming shows. Love getting to meet the cast after the show. I know they are planning on a relocation soon to the mall area so hopefully they will be able to expand their lobby for seating. I always say support the performing arts and the little guy! For the cost, variety and quality it can't be beat!

Whenever we find a groupon, living social or any deal for a place we have never been to but might be interested in trying, we take the plunge and buy it. Such is the case with lox, stock and barrel which isn't even in the vicinity of where we live, but turns out definitely worth the drive. With bagels almost as big as your face and the freshest taste and cream cheese choices, there is no doubt this won't be our first visit.  I did find the whole ordering process to be a bit confusing which I think would help myself and others were it better organized. But overall they offer take out and order and sit down service.  No waitress service from what I can tell. Can't wait to go back and try other varieties but the cinnamon gooey was a slice of heaven.

I am not a fan of family style dining (get your fork off my plate!) so it's not exactly what I would want to do. That being said the food was awesome. Price is on the high side and I didn't like that the young hostess didn't ask us before hand how we felt about eating upstairs or walking up steps when there was an elevator there. That is something that needs to be asked right away before seating anyone. My partner in crime didn't care for that either and service can be slow at times. I plan on going back due to the food and for that alone it gets 4 stars.

As far as diners go, this one was excellent and the reason for 5 stars is because of how good it was.  The interior and exterior are reminiscent of the old time diner, but with a lot of these places the food falls far short of expectations. That was not the case at 5&diner. It's clean and the service was great, with 50's music playing. I had the meatloaf which was better then Mom's and hubby had the Mrs. Cleaver pot roast. Both great dishes at an affordable price made even better with milkshakes that were awesome. A great find here in the Phoenix area well worth a stop for breakfast, lunch or dinner.

Being from Philadelphia and experiencing great diners growing up, I was saddened to move to Raleigh, NC and find we don't have a good diner here. So after watching a diner's drive in and dives show, which featured this establishment, we decided to give it a try once we visited Charlotte. The Neighborhood is "sketchy" at best... I was a little worried about the outside not being much to look at. So imagine my suprise once inside to see the dessert case with (gasp) tasty and large treats to try. We went for dinner, and as Guy had suggested I tried the turkey dinner. It was lip smackin' good- as they like to say in the south. I fell in love instantly with this place.Just to be sure I wasn't dreaming about a good diner in the south, we came back the next morning for breakfast..and the dream became a reality. Our breakfast was just as tasty, and now every visit to Charlotte requires at least one- or two- stops at the Landmark Diner!

I have been a big Belk's shopper for years due to their fantastic interest free credit card program, reward dollars and sales. So in speaking to a friend over a year ago, she suggested I visit their flagship store - which happens to be this location. Several floors and many hours later- I was hooked! What appears to be a rival to many other fine department stores, Belk's offers many name brands and options priced low to very high. The shoe department is large but can appear understaffed and very messy at times. An impressive handbag department and jewelry department. Great ladies department and teenager department. Nothing to complain about except perhaps more registers, and of course bathrooms.

Ah...first impressions are important. First impression of this location....can I stay somewhere else??? We had  to since we had a good rate. Construction workers littered the front of the building smoking cigarettes. Can you guys move so we can check in? They literally wouldn't move and hubby had to carefully maneuver our vehicle around them.  Inside the SMALL Lobby had a couch that had a rip in it. Room had a TV With an attached sticker that read "TV only works here in 3 languages". That tells you a lot about this place. Shower only, no tub. Light over bathroom sink blew out. No lamps on each side of the bed. Hubby had to cover his head so I could stay up late reading. (Yes I know I should have brought a book light!) OK, it was only for one night and we were supposed to be in a nonsmoking room, so why did our room smell of smoking???? I didn't' sleep much (neither did hubby) and I woke up with a sore throat..... check out and on our way! Yea!!!  If you must stay here then it is adequate, to a fault, otherwise there are better choices around.

What a wonderful place! I can't say enough about the fine staff, decor and rooms. Hubby said the location is convenient to downtown and the airport. We had a suite that was bigger then my first apartment with a separate living room with tv and desk and couch. Our room had 2 large screen flat tv that did have movies to rent. Only downside for me was no tub, but only a large shower. Breakfast was a real fully cooked to order breakfast with made to order omelets, and everything else you could want. All free!! A gracious staff in the atrium setting for breakfast that moves quickly along and restaurant quality omelets to boot! I was greeted with a warm "good morning" from the cooks to the staffers who clean tables. A nicely appointed exercise room and pool area. Three quick elevators so no waiting. This is my new favorite place to stay in charlotte and stays on our favorites list!

I love the intricate details of this place with the unique shows and opportunities for social events such as Silent movie Sunday and ghost tours. It definitely shows the era in which royalty and monies were the name of the game with no expenses spared. Be sure to check out the kissing room and ask for the story behind it.

My relocation to the area brought me to this church. I wanted something not too preachy or screaming at me from the pulpit about damnation which I have experienced before. Something up to date with the life and times of today's people and families. Very happy to report it was exactly what I was looking for. Took a tour afterward of the church and sanctuary etc and everyone I met was friendly and welcoming. I am going to continue to check it out during the weekly Offerings as well as Sunday. Hope to meet you there.

Unity of Phoenix has been my church of choice since the first day I attended back in May 2014. This is not your parents church! You won't find rigid, screaming from the pulpit about original sin preaching here. What you will find is acceptance and love of all people, with the biggest emphasis not on original sin but on original blessings. You will find that God loves you and you are worthy of Gods love. The bible and mans interpretation doesn't play the most important role here, but what does is practical applications for every day life, and learning to walk closer to God in your own personal relationship with him. What I have learned at UOP has influenced me to become the best version of myself. It may not be for everyone but it's definitely worth a visit, and with Wednesday service, Sunday services and classes during the week there is more then enough for everyone. This is a wonderful environment for young and old with so much to offer. And church can be fun too! Bet your parents never told you that!

Anyone who remembers as far back as my age would announce, knows that ice cream parlors are hard to come by. This one dates back to the 50's in a GREAT WAY. It's exactly what you would want in an ice cream shop. Even the waitresses appear to be a throwback to a time before they were even born (young girls wearing poodle skirts). I loved my time here and the ice cream is probably as great as the day they opened. You  can even order the option of one that serves the whole table. And why not have a party here as well?  My hot fudge sundae was glorious and next time I might have to go with the larger size.

Recently received a menu in our mail and decided to give the deep dish a try. I called it in and hubby picked up to bring home. Awesome deep dish pizza very Chicago authentic and crust perfectly cooked. Best part is it held firmly together and even  a few days later enjoyed leftover pizza that still tasted amazing.

Dined here with a friend for happy hour. Happy hour lasts all night which is great because of my budget. Lucky for us they have a good menu with options to choose from. We shared the happy hour Pizza, potato cakes, and nacho dip. I had a bay breeze which was perfect and we had a great waiter who made our experience a pleasant one. I plan on returning in the near future.

Fantastic experience with views that can't be beat. Great narration and honestly worth the drive. Had dinner which was ok. It's catered so brought on board before steamboat leaves. Chicken over cooked not much to choose from. I would definitely take another boat ride and would recommend to others- with or without the meal.

I am a fan of dinner theater and this one did not disappoint. The sets were awesome and the food was actually good!!! Sometimes buffets are a huge letdown but I loved the sage stuffing, garlic mashed, and the desserts were great too. This place is clean with great shows, cast and crew. You can even get tickets just for the show! No reason at all not to go!

You won't find well known names at this club, but you will find an affordable evening out with great comedians. Buy tickets in advance on PayPal, show up early for good parking and seating. Was surprised that they don't serve food here but you can order from the menu for the place next door and they will deliver it to you. I also saw people bringing in their own food. Two drink minimum per person which seems to be standard. But bottled water does count so that's good too. Supporting live comedy is what we do!

Nothing like strip shopping center Italian to make you appreciate a good Italian meal. Large portions and good bread, my favorite part of the meal was actually the dessert of chocolate mousse. It was perfection! The pappardelle bolognese was flavorful. Hubby went with the grilled chicken and shrimp in pesto and enjoyed it to the last bite, while also enjoying panna cotta as dessert. Decent pricing and a busy place worthy of a second meal.

My friends daughter works here so we ate here on her evening off. Seems a very popular place with a dark interior that could probably use some sprucing up.  Reminds me a lot of your typical chain place but the food was reasonably priced and the wait staff top notch.  I had one of the burgers and baked beans. My burger topped with cheese, Canadian bacon and chopped onions.  They enjoyed the shrimp linguini which looked good as well. We also shared an appetizer of spinach dip which was enough for all of us. Management seemed great and the bathrooms clean. Overall great experience and a mid-low price place that isn't too hard on the budget.

I can only comment on what I experienced during our night time visit for "the Gauntlet" haunted house. We had purchased a combo ticket for the haunted house and spooky golf. We have only recently moved here and didn't know our way around and the signs weren't clear of where to go. Having visited the restroom first, I found it to be disgusting with an overflowed toilet and water on the floor. Quickly leaving that area we had to ask around to find the haunted house. It was well done for the space used and I have no compliant about that. Once done with the haunted house we went to get our golf clubs and proceeded to what we thought was the golf course. We didn't know where to go so picked one of two- called the Princess. Really tough course and I wondered where all of the decorations were. Once done the crazy course we came across the one we expected to play on- the spooky one but had no signs leading to it. I complained about it and was told "we don't tell people about the spooky one unless they ask and if we wanted to play we can pay extra". No apologies and really- no signs??  Had to visit the restroom again before leaving and found it to be functioning but disgusting still. Note to parents- bring hand sanitizer and eat elsewhere as the food looked awful as well.

I had a craving for Mexican- American type food, and since there is no longer a Chi-chi's around my friend suggested we go here since I was visiting the area from out of town. She is a frequent diner here, and loves it.  I really enjoyed my experience as well.  I love a great Chimichanga along with  re-fried beans and ordered a much  needed strawberry  Margareta.  So lovely!!!! I enjoyed everything on my plate!   I Loved it so much I suggested we come back my last night in town for drinks and appetizers. We decided to order the  Mini Chimi Sampler, Macayo's Famous Cheese Crisp that I ordered with ground beef (it almost looked like a cheese crisp pizza),Guacamole Dip with chips. They also offer free salsa and chips every time you arrive. Like my friend- I would be a regular here. I know when I visit my friend that she and I will go back- at my suggestion and to  her delight!

Once my plane landed in sunny Arizona my friend knew without question where I wanted to go for drinks and food.  The food is always great and I love that they bring out warm chips and salsa made two ways- mild and spicy. We ordered appetizers as well and it was all great. In the two times I visited I would say during this visit that the service was on the slow side, but a problem with my meal was addressed by management efficiently. I would not hesitate to go again and I hope this won't be my last visit.

Why oh why are there so few Caribou coffee places left- when obviously they truly are the best coffee places around! Having found one here while visiting Charlotte- not only does it have great seating but its attached to Brueggers bagels! Heaven and earth combo. On this beautiful day it would be great to have more seating outside- but we managed to snag the comfy leather chairs. I have Been spending a lot more time at Starbucks because of losing my beloved Caribou- so today I got the chance to compare Caribou white chocolate pumpkin to Starbucks pumpkin latte! Caribou wins the pumpkin prize hands down. The best coffee ever and the nicest people. Maybe Caribou should do more combo places- save the brand and keep serving your loyal following!

While visiting my dear friend in Scottsdale, AZ- she knows I am a shopping addict so we spent a few hours here. It's a nice mall for sure,  probably one of the largest in the area. Upscale, along with shops that regular folks can shop at. A nice food court and also sit down restaurants as well. I wouldn't hesitate to visit this mall if I were local, and if I am ever in the area again I would probably go back

Very much enjoyed this place! Parking was a bit of a problem but sitting outside with lights on the true was very sweet. We shared a Genova pizza which was absolutely perfect in flavor and size. Not a white pizza but a no sauce pizza. This is a house made into a restaurant that has a lot of character. I will definitely be putting this back on my go to list for a second try.

They call this mid century modern. A 1950 era throwback and exactly as described. We only had the pleasure of dining here for Sunday brunch but it was well worth the experience. My red velvet waffle should be considered illegal it was so good! Hubby had a spinach omelet with real spinach not packaged. I definitely want to take a tour they offer of the hotel, rooms and grounds for the throwback price of 19.56 so we will be arranging this for another time. It's not just a hotel but an adventure.  Where is my turquoise chevy with the back fins? I felt like I was in a Pan Am movie and wanted to see those 1950 beauties around.  Our first visit but certainly not our last!

While visiting Fashion Square Mall, my friend suggested we splurge and have a nice dinner. After looking at the menu, we decided to try it.  I enjoyed the Mac + Cheese- which was a large portion of  chicken breast, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar, parmesan, campanelle pasta & truffle oil. It was truly delicious and I enjoyed every bite of it. I paid extra for a ceasar salad that was nothing special, but still good.  My friend enjoyed the  Rib Eye (12oz) with garlic mashed potatoes, green beans & shallot butter. She stated it was the best steak that she had ever had. She also paid extra for a salad, and felt the same about her salad, but she also asked for extra ranch dressing, which never arrived.  My friend  also enjoyed a bikini martini that I had a taste of. It was just lovely but due to the prices of the drinks, opted to not have one.  The prices were kind of high to us, and our server didnt really give us warm fuzzy feelings, and at times we felt sort of rushed to complete our meal.  I think perhaps as a special occasion I would go again, perhaps not.  But it was definitely worth a try and the menu is diverse enough to have something cheaper.

One of my friends raved about this place as she grew up here, so we made our way on a Friday night. She enjoys the specials in the bar area, which can become really crowded and loud at times. The food and drink are top notch, and twice we have had the same waiter, Joe who takes great care of us. The food is top notch,  I haven't had anything I didn't love yet, and my friend is very familiar with the menu and all of her recommendations are right on par. It's one of my new favorite places to go. They also have take out, a restaurant part and outdoor area. You can tell why this place is always busy, because even the chips and salsa are fresh. Can't wait to go again!

This place is beautiful at Christmas with the ice skating rink, Christmas trees, carousel, train ride or take the walkway to see all of the lights. If you don't stay here (which we didn't since we are local) you pay a fee to park of $30 but if you dine for $75.00 parking is free. While the food could have been better the kids and young at heart will love the feeling of Christmas and it would be a great getaway for those living both near and far.

Sadly not the best experience. Weird situation with parking and no signs really directing you where to go. The escalator was broken and along with another couple we found the elevator and made our way to the theater. I love AMC especially the reclining chairs but we were in that dine in regular theater. Food was horrible!  Tasted like it all came from expired can. Hubby had gourmet Mac and cheese and I had potato skins. How can you mess that up. Wait Service soooo slow even blocked the screen ahead of us with taking orders. Popcorn bucket probably only good thing except later my stomach hated that too. Expensive movie date. Think I will stick with my favorite AMC and ditch this one.

Boy do I love a great Pancake house, and since I was visiting my friend in Scottsdale, she suggested we dine here. We dined a total of 3 days straight for breakfast, and each time I ordered something different for breakfast. This is a popular place for sure! They do their best to keep your coffee cup filled at all times, and the orange juice is freshly squeezed with pulp in it. The toast is thick, which I really enjoy. The bacon is awesome and I would love to have it all of the time!  I believe they are open from 6:30 am to 2:30 pm and the lines and wait moves fairly quickly.  I loved the pancakes, again the batter is made fresh. The waffles were good too. The sausage benedict was ok and I wish I had tried something different. My friend loves the biscuits with gravy which is also fresh and tasty.  I will miss you Pancake house, but rest assured I will see  when I return to the area.

Loved this place. They have a drive-thru along with a nice eat in area. It's clean and the employees were very friendly. Great product and  wouldn't hesitate to return there. Only issue is that it was a little slow, but it could have been due to being so busy (which is a good thing!).   I had a decedent black forest drink and a slice of iced cake. Warmed up it was heaven. My only wish is one closer to where I live.

I go here regularly as the hours are great, and the customer service is top notch. They not only remember my name (unbelievable for this day and age) but they are full service and answer the phone when I call and can handle any banking issue, or problem I have. They also will recommend products and services to give you the best experience that you may not have even considered before. Evening hours and Saturday hours and because of the staff here I won't go anywhere else.

Had a wonderful evening at the symphony thanks to a friend. First time here and the ushers were very helpful with regards to her walker. They tag and store it. The aisles are wide enough you don't have to climb over those around you to get to your seat. We sat in the back but center and with each row being slightly higher then the next, we were able to see perfectly. I especially like this since I am short! The sound quality was exceptional and bathrooms were clean (still lines for the ladies room) but they moved quickly. Parking in the garage can get expensive at $12.00 a shot but still an easy walk to the theater and a great show!

I love this store and the staff here. Well laid out and clean and very helpful, even taking my bags out to the car and loading them for me.  The hot food area is great when you want something quick, and there is even a starbucks here and a wells fargo bank so I can do more then just my food shopping. The cakes always look so inviting and I use my safeway card to save money every time. The wait is not long to check out and convenient parking is always available.

I truly love these kinds of tours and seeing old homes that have been restored. This one didn't disappoint. It's about an hour long and hearing the stories and being able to take photos was great. Our tour guide was personable and gave a lot of great information. Take an out of towner or as someone who lives here go and visit as well.

Last time my husband visited the area without me he found this little gem of a place. He brought us home tea from here for our nightly ritual before bed and it was very good. While perusing the tea selections I also had a chocolate chai tea latte on ice which in retrospect was so great I wish I had gotten the larger size!  This place will close for a while and then reopen as a cafe/market And will add wine and food. It's located where you can't see it from the street but in the courtyard not far from Barnes and Noble. I can tell you that if I lived here we would be regulars for sure.  In my case It was only a place I can visit when in the area, sadly.  And for my hubby I picked out 4 Teas for us to try when I return home.

Yelp is just such a help when searching for places to eat. Having come across this on yelp we decided to give it a try. The parking lot is waaaay tooooo small for the amount of people who dine here, but somehow we managed to secure a parking spot.  Once inside we found out that there was a wait, but she mentioned that there was availability at the bar. We immediately decided to sit at the bar and we were waited on right away. All of the burgers looked great and we both had no complaints over our food whatsoever. Very tasty and loved the fries as well.  I would go again in a heartbeat, and certainly hope they make their way to Raleigh some time soon.

Loved this local place that is homey and warm with a nice indoor area as well as an outside area that appears dog friendly! Yes!  We had a great breakfast. We love breakfast!  While the potatoes Could use more seasoning everything else was great. Will have to go back and try some other items on menu but this place is a keeper!

We purchased a deal for this place, and found we had an excellent meal here. It is in the hotel, and they do validate parking for you when you ask for it. The burger I had was awesome, along with the sweet potato fries. Hubby had shrimp and grits which was excellent. Both of us tried dessert and really enjoyed it. It definitely was pricey, but if the food is great I don't mind paying. And I would return again for sure.

Have been here a year already and not experienced this before? What Is wrong with me? Chompies is chomp chomp chomp good. I may be biased because it's for everyone but reminded me of my Jewish heritage.  Hubby went with the brisket dinner which he marveled over being tender and plentiful with a side potato latkes. I had the Jewish sliders and while good they were a little hard to eat. Full take home capacity allowed me to bring home some chopped liver. Boy have I missed you!  Don't be discouraged the menu is large and has something for everyone! Next stop breakfast! My new favorite place to go. Don't forget to try the crunchy pickles they bring to the table. See you there!

Owned by Panera, this place has all of the things I love! Soups, sandwiches, bagels, treats and decent pricing. Clean, easy to get in and out of, the only issue I found was where do I order? Where do I pay? Do I leave my dishes or do they clean up behind me? Maybe I missed the signs but it seemed they could do a better job of directing traffic so to speak?

Thanks to Yelp, we came across this place for breakfast and had to give a try. It truly didn't disappoint at all. The service was quick, the food was adequate without being overly large. Great family place and seems very popular with the locals. I think when we come back to the area, we will go again.

This place is too cute!! Exactly what you would want for a local coffee/tea place. Check in for yelp offer and look for the sign because it's off to the side on a side street

On a beautiful Friday night we visited the haunted corn maze. It was well done and a long walk at  1 mile, however the missing ingredient to anything haunted is to worry what is around the next corner. Because of the mile long walk it might have been too much for the owners to staff with ghouls, so it fell short of that. There are parts to the walk where you kind of sink into the ground so may not be suitable for certain individuals, but certainly an enjoyable time for young adults and big kids like us.

Certainly one of the best offered here in Phoenix. With 5 different haunted houses and lots of ghouls working the event, you can tell there is a lot of work put into it. It's almost a whole night event if you don't go with the fast pass. Each attraction you wait in line for. I found the sets very well done.  I found the only downside is actually the street lights were blinding at times.  Definitely worth the money and top of my list for places to return to. Not for those who scare easily.

After checking out pizza options in the area, we decided to try this place due to the great reviews.  Why only 4 stars? Because I want a larger pizza for the price! It was that good! We went with a specialty pizza that had a great crust and was perfectly cooked. The toppings were average in how many were on the pizza but the flavor was wonderful and we added their sausage which is a must try. The interior is nothing to write home about. The menu could provide more options as well and the server could warm up a bit.  Perhaps he wasn't thrilled with having to work on the holiday?  I want more!

Has a great patio that is pet friendly! Bonus points! You do have to order inside and they bring your food to you, but it is breakfast done right. Had a craving for eggs Benedict and it delivers on flavor. Hubby went with his standard omelet. Loved the hash browns they were perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. Winner all around!

Cute place had a late breakfast here. Wait staff friendly and food was delicious. You have to Order at counter but line moved quickly. Great little store and cute shopping center which can be hard to find parking at.  Prices seem reasonable and the pastry case is inviting. Took a little treat home which was wonderful and devoured it in private. Seating can be challenging but I wouldn't hesitate to go again.

This is a really cute place! Very eclectic in it's interior. The dessert case to the right of the entrance is very enticing and appears as if the desserts would be great. I believe they are made in house. This place does boast a wait, and aggravating the fact is that they don't give out any hand held devices that buzz when they are ready to seat you, but call your name instead. We waited about 15 minutes early Sunday morning, as this place is very popular. Hubby and I enjoyed our breakfast and our waitress was on top of things the whole time. Our coffee cups were never empty at all.  Hubby went with the Cajun omelet with potatoes. He immediately commented how appetizing it all looked and confirmed that after having a bite of each. I had the eggs Benedict which I had been craving for awhile. I ordered your standard eggs Benedict but was less then thrilled with it, it was just very standard and didn't taste any better then the one my hubby makes for me at home. The potatoes were good, with nice seasoning and bits of onions and peppers to add to the flavor. I also had a side of corned beef hash and that had a spice in it I couldn't identify, but it added a nice flavor to it. We would definitely go back again for both breakfast, and dinner. Hubby and I both love diners and to find a good one is rare, and we look forward to visiting again.

A great find nearby and certainly worth the trip. I had the power pancake which was huge and filling and definitely worth trying as stated on the menu.  A side of bacon with that proved to be filling enough to get me through the day. Hubby went with his standard omelet, of cheese. Nothing too thrilling but he did say the hash browns were under seasoned which is a big no no in both of our books. Seems like a family place and overall a good experience.

As early as we got here, I didn't expect to see much activity. However at the early hour of 5:15 this place was going pretty strong and more people started at arrive.  Very nicely decorated and loved the open kitchen along with the light fixtures. We both didn't think the bread served was the best, as it was seasoned and served cold. However the rest of the meal was top notch.  Hubby went with the creamy tomato with goat cheese. It was excellent and natural flavor with a snippet of goat cheese that went perfectly together. We chose vivace meatball appetizer and the sauce was perfect. For an entree hubby went with scallop risotto that had a perfect sear and prosciutto that was flavorful and well balanced with snap peas.  As I dove with delight into the special - duck lasagna bolognese with house made cheese and layered veggies- it was without a doubt the best lasagne I have had in my life.  The best part is it will be added to the regular menu! Both of us too full for dessert- we left well fed and happy and the prices weren't out of line either. Having a nice deal to use helped - but without that I still think the meal was top notch, excellent service and reasonable for a High end Dining experience. Nice valet parking as well. Worth the visit!

Our experience here was a great one. Cute place reminds me of those bars you find at the beach. Reasonable prices as well with weeknight specials. I had the fish and chips and thought It was delicious. My friend had a steak and enjoyed hers as well. Would definitely visit again.

We love Mellow Mushroom and were excited to find one here in Phoenix after moving from Raleigh, Nc. MM was a favorite and has not disappointed in the past, with great pizza. We love the red skin potato pie since discovering it at our last visit. What made this visit 5 star was the customer service we received. Having been seated next to a long (and loud) table nearby ( which I would like to point out is never a good idea) our pizza took a very long time to get to our table, and when I start to get upset then watch out. The manager delivered our long awaited pizza himself at a discount and that made all the difference. Not only did the quality continue for a great experience but we left impressed and satisfied and I get to enjoy leftovers tomorrow- and I never had to say a word!  It's just as important to have great food as it is to keep customers happy and for the reasons mentioned above we will continue to frequent MM.

What a cute place! Located along a alleyway  that has a few shops. It's a great place to sit and have a bite to eat. All freshly made with homemade handcrafted soda's as well. I had the tuna melt which was very good and hubby had their French dip sandwich. We sat outside on a lovely day being entertained by music. The place is small and menu limited but friendly service with good food.

When I was growing up long john silver was a weekday event we always looked forward to. Then unfortunately there were no more around. Fast forward years later and the combo KFC/LJS shows up In my area of Raleigh,NC. I was thrilled till I are there and found it not to be anything like I remember.  Now in Phoenix I thought I would give it one more try. So happy to report this one does it right! It always clean and the staff is friendly with oldies playing which I know my husband enjoys that gives a warm feel to this place. On to the food- it's fresh perfectly cooked from my favorites of chicken, shrimp and fish to items such as baked cod. If you like seafood but didn't think you could find it in fast food this is the place. I consider it my weekly calorie splurge that doesn't break my bank account.

I have never been into one of these stores that had so many customers! Found everything I wanted except a place to sit! Prices are ok and I did sell 2 of my hardback books. Obviously you won't make a ton of money selling your used books, but the pocket change helped. All set for a summer of reading!

In the short time I have lived here it's been a pleasant experience. The grounds are highly maintained  and the staff are friendly and quick to respond. They also remember your name and that is certainly a plus living in the community, and they sign and hold your packages which helps a lot.  Only downside is that the work out area is small and doesn't provide much motivation, and sometimes the free computers are busy and there is no paper in the printer. Other then these two issues, I think Courtney, Brooke and Jason are wonderful along with the rest of the staff, and this is certainly one of the best locations in Phoenix. The apartments themselves have high ceilings which still doesn't distract from  noise from neighbors above, and the vertical blinds get noisy with the ceiling fans on. The island kitchen is great and decent size bathrooms along with a small laundry closet that works for small loads. Refrigerator, dishwasher, stove and microwave are in black which I happen to love. Countertops are nicer then your standard apartments. We enjoy living here and would highly recommend it.

My friend suggested I stay here while visiting her, since it was close to where she lives. The price considering the other resorts nearby seemed the best I could do financially, so I reserved a room here. No problems with the reservation, or check in. Nothing special really, and "adequate" would be the best way to describe this place. They do have an outdoor pool for the kids. They also have a coffee bar along with bagels and some baked wrapped goods. Again nothing special and I understand that since I made the suggestion of having 2 pots of each coffee ready for guests, they are going to make that change. I noticed people behind me had to wait 10 minutes for a new pot to brew, and when you are in a hurry you don't want to wait that long. My room consisted of a queen bed, a couch and tv and a little dining area of refrigerator with freezer, and some dishes and a small stove. I didn't cook anything while here so I can't comment on the stove. The bathroom has a tub which I appreciated, however no shampoo is provided and I had to go down the following morning to request some. No conditioner is available either. Again, an adequate hair dryer IS provided which was nice to have since I didn't bring one. I didn't know this but they don't provide room service daily, only for people staying more then 7 days I believe. I requested more pillows the next morning, after a sleepless night of tossing and turning on my ironing board comfortable bed. When I returned that evening NON were provided. The next morning I went down to get a cup of coffee, but my coffee consisted of grinds. I told the manager at the front desk who led me back to where they brew the coffee, and got a fresh cup. I also explained how uncomfortable the bed was, and the pillows being so squishy they provided no  support whatsoever. He offered to have them flip the mattress over, but I didn't think that would make a difference. The pillows I requested WERE in the room by my return that evening. I probably would have to stay here again since it is fairly close to my friend, and not far from Scottsdale Blvd which is a major road for everything.  However, if I can find something around the same price, I wouldn't hesitate to go elsewhere. The rooms are clean so no worry there, and the staff is very dedicated to trying to make your stay a good one so I can't fault them for that. However, I think they need to update their beds and pillows, because I am paying to sleep there, and would have loved a great nights sleep.

Great vibe!!!! I love how happy the employees are at dutch brothers! You just feel happy even in the parking lot. When the line gets long the employees come out to take your drink order. My first time at one of these and they did a whip cream heart on my straw. How cool is that. Happy employees make great drinks. I look forward to trying everything they have to offer.

It was a bit of a challenge for this out of Towner to find this place but I am glad I did. I brought home about 4 different teas for my husband to brew for us before bed. Each one has been fantastic. The girl who helped me was a true delight and I apologize for forgetting her name. She was very patient and helpful. They also have a free check in offer for a tea and I chose an iced Tea that was wonderful on this semi hot afternoon. You get this with purchase and believe me there is enough of a selection as well as tea pots and mugs to look around. Well worth a visit to old town Scottsdale and I know if I were local we would all know each other by name!

We had a fun time here for the skewed news hour. It's not easy being that funny with a  newspaper article only to go off of, but this talented cast of individuals all have what it takes to make it work! It's a small intimate theater maybe seats 25 at most. You (the audience) get to choose from newspaper articles they leave out. For my article I chose the "smoke free apartment communities are trending". Not an easy topic and of course one scene went to another wherever the topics took them to. They were easily able to wrap them at the  end and tie them into a nice rounded show. Really enjoyed it and while only a one hour show wouldn't hesitate to go back again. It's funny where the mind can take a subject, and entertaining as well. That's improv at its finest!

Its great to have a drive in to go to, and the memories I have from long ago took me back to this simpler time. I was worried about kids running around and the noise of others around us on cell phones, but we had none of those issues. The walk to the bathroom and concession stand was a bit much, but that's ok for an experience to be outside on a beautiful evening. With 9 screens to pick from, its easy to find a single or double feature to watch. Price wasn't bad either.

It is certainly a cute little dinner, and well worth visiting if you have never been before. We decided to try it before going to the comedy club down the street. Hubby went with the meatloaf with garlic mashed. The meatloaf was good, but he felt he had eaten better meatloaf before. I was in the mood for a meatball sandwich, with some mac and cheese. Certainly comfort food for the two of us. The meatball sandwich was bland, not really that good. The mac and cheese wasn't made with your traditional macaroni. Perhaps they ran out and decided to substitute it with another type. Just OK again. I guess for the nostalgic roadside diner effect  it is a great little place to go, but I consider we did it and we don't have to go again.

What an awesome place to take your kids or go by yourself and act like a kid. The magical forest was so well done for Christmas. The lights and atmosphere definitely magical. The 3d elf might not be for young kids with the 3d glasses but we loved it. There is a train ride for all ages, mini golf, polar slide. Etc and really a fun place to go.

My friend and I had a highly enjoyable experience thanks in part to our great server Robin who deserves a shout-out. Our service was top notch, non rushed and perfectly paced.  Enjoyed the salad (who doesn't love it) and perfect bread sticks. My entree of the garlic Rosemary chicken was perfect for me under 575 calories and I took half home to enjoy for lunch the next day.  My friend is somewhat picky so all of her requests were handled with grace.  I love Olive Garden and would not hesitate to go to this location again.

I am so happy to have discovered this place. As someone who is a big believer in a chiropractic adjustment, I find that the hours are perfect for my busy lifestyle and Dr. Roach has really helped to make me feel comfortable and welcome. I feel much better when I leave and I love the financing options available. I intend to be a regular because of his excellent treatment.

The Stage door theater is definitely a small intimate venue. Our first visit here brought us to see the show "You say tomato, I say shut up". Hubby paid the up charge to have us seated in the front, where they provide mini tables. Since I am short I prefer to not have someone seated in front of me,and I don't mind being in the front row. This worked well and added $5.00 more PP to our ticket. No assigned seats at all in this theater. Come early and get your drinks and snacks if you need them (at the consession stand). No waitress service once inside the theater either. After the 3 (or 4) rows of tables you will find chairs. Again not assigned seating. The show was top notch and I anticipate going to "The Stage door" many times in the future.

Our new ice cream favorite! Cute little shop homemade ice cream flavors and toppings. Decent sizes too to get your ice cream fix. Fresh and clean and a small outdoor area to eat. No dine in though. Old time candy for sale along with cookies freshly baked. They also serve floats and milkshakes. Our first visit won't be our last!

What can I say except in a dozen years my husband and I have visited many haunted attractions. We just love  them and especially love the sets, and costumes, and special effects.  We went with fast passes, as we aren't a fan of waiting, and with early tickets we were in and out in 25 minutes. The best part for me as far as special effects was the "swamp" area. Best thing I have seen in years. Most times our biggest complaint is not enough "ghouls" jumping out but this was no the case when we went on a Friday night.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there was no real ending and we all walked out wondering why.

Have been here twice now and I had been told it's under new management so they are definitely taking customers suggestions into play.  For us we have now decided that taking the light rail is a great idea and it's only down the block.  You can use the parking garage but since the club is downtown you have to pay after 3 hours validation. The food is really good with large portions. Would love to see potato skins on the menu, even popcorn would be great. Drinks are always good (bit pricey) and a two drink minimum. Seating is intimate style at long tables which I have never liked so be prepared to meet your neighbors. That's one thing I would love to see changed because I also want to sit next to hubby, not across from him. Large women's bathroom which is a huge plus. Top comics and great shows. We will be frequent customers thanks to great treatment by staff and management.

what a cute place.  The butter burgers are made to order and melted in my mouth.  I am definitely a fan of the Wisconsin cheese curds. The malt milkshake was a little on the heavy side and hard to drink but otherwise good, not great or outstanding though. You place your order at the counter and they bring it to you when it's ready. They also have a drive thru which I haven't tried yet so I don't know how quick that might be. I do intend to go again for an inexpensive meal that is cooked right.

Our first time here and the first thing you notice is limited parking. You have to park on the street and we did walk a bit.. The other thing I certainly did not like was a "VIP" entrance leading into the club. Really????? You seriously have to make your "regular" patrons walk all the way around to the other side, through the LOUD bar??? Why? I paid for premium seats so why didn't that include this magical entrance? I truly think that you should get rid of this, because it is comical for sure. We were seated promptly with great seats I had chosen right in front of the stage, and hubby and I first commented that the tables weren't as close together as other clubs we go to. It was spread out and larger for sure. The waitress promptly greeted us and the people that sat at our table ordered food, which looked very appetizing. Hubby would have liked to have had a non alcoholic beer or drink but they don't have any. Another great suggestion for the management to consider. The comedians were top notch, and the best part was getting to meet them and having our picture taken with them after the show. We plan on attending again for any special event comedian that may catch our eye.

It's a very cute place and I had a nice conversation with the owner who was there at the time I visited. I ordered a Chai Latte  on ice which was excellent and the place is really cute and clean. Next time I am in the area I will try a different drink along with one of their cupcakes.   I am doing the best I I can to support locally owned/operated places. You should too.

Had a friend take me here for a nice happy hour get together. We sat outside and while it was early and empty, still had a wonderful time enjoying our drinks and appetizers, at a budget conscience price but exceptional quality. I wouldn't hesitate to go again. I did see some problems with parking which might be an issue at a later hour, and our waitress had us pay before she clocked out and no one ever checked on us after that, but overall a great experience. We enjoyed the bruchetta done 3 ways, the artichoke dip and corn cakes and all were great, along with her wine and my lavender mint drink.

It's hard to mess up breakfast, so we both decided to try toast based on the reviews. Unfortunately Toast didn't live up to our expectations. Seating was a breeze and service was quick. Nice location and clean place. What could have been great was pretty boring. We both noticed the smaller serving of what could best be described as eating at home for us and lack appearance. Except my husband who usually makes breakfast knows how to season the food. His eggs benedict is much better.  With salt and pepper in hand after tasting- I immediately went to work adding flavor to my meal. Everything was pretty bland and lacked any seasoning. Dark dark coffee which we both didn't care for. Expensive too for us we would have paid a lot less elsewhere- Even at our hotel buffet breakfast. Truly sad as they only serve breakfast and lunch- and we had high hopes for this place

We had a place similar to this in Raleigh, NC where I moved from. Except at this one there  are some upgraded things I like better! You can choose where you sit and the menu is a lot more varied. They have a great lobby area to grab a drink. There is a silent buzzer at each seat so you can order with some ease. They do need lighted pens for when it's time to pay your bill. The seating is office like chairs which I could do without but otherwise a nice experience for dinner and movie.

We were so excited to find the caribou coffee we always loved combined with a bagel place. And this location isn't anywhere near where we live so it's one of those "experiences" we talk about having when we have a coffee date. We've been here several times and each time seems hit or miss. Today, will be our last time visiting. I have noticed each time I have gone how they will "not" honor coupons! There is no sign on the door or anywhere stipulating this but it's gotten to the point where we are like "oh we have a coupon, let's go for a ride" to getting there and being told: "We don't honor coupons unless they are personalized" Or- "That coupon only covers a medium" when the coupon clearly states "any size" and my other favorite line "you have to be a member of our smear club" which I am so what's the problem here? Nothing seems to be able to be "scanned" because of their  lousy Internet. Today hubby had a coupon for a free twist bagel with the purchase of another bagel. They wouldn't honor it because they said "it didn't come directly to you, that coupon came from Einsteins". What????? I had a coupon for a bogo caribou drink . After several attempts to show its for any size they would only allow mediums. This isn't a one time thing but consistent refusal to honor coupons and if management is training and feels that way then I guess everyone should know. The guy who waited on me said they tell all customers this after their first visit. Really? Maybe I didn't finally wake up to this obvious deception until now! The drinks and food are hit or miss. There is no standard of excellence and the whole ordering process is a hot mess.   Calories, money and experiences are too important to me at this stage, and with this last experience I've decided to take my business elsewhere.

Very well done haunted attraction. You can tell from start to finish there is a lot of work put into the details. I was told they start working on this place in March. Not for the faint of heart as the people we started with finished much later then we did. Loved the "swamp" and Santa Claus lane.  Fast pass tickets might be a good idea if you don't want to wait in a long line. I think to get a 5 star rating they should consider having some scary individuals outside getting people revved up for the event. Otherwise worth the money spent.

As close to perfection as one could ever reach, so was our experience at Gordon Ramsay. I will start off my explaining my 4 star review: Food: beyond perfection perfectly executed with flavors that were incredible- even the coffee is top notch!  Service: excellent in every way. I think overall that the tasting menu is truly the only way to go and our 5 course meal was worth every penny along with our folded menu and signed photo of Gordon to take home and treasure from our event. My only complaint overall and not a big deal is that I feel the tables are a bit close together and while dinner took almost a full 2 hours, it almost felt a bit rushed.  Make a reservation as we did because you want to have a great experience. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to a friend and to celebrate a special event. And I hope I get to experience this again in my lifetime.

Very cute small intimate theater for live shows on a small scale. This is very tucked away in the very back corner near the 2nd Wind equipment place with a small sign above. Strip mall shopping center which seems to be the way of things here in AZ. Big on laughs and great acting, definitely worth a visit for live plays

Reminds me of going to one of those places on the boardwalk that has surfer appeal. The burgers are excellent. I had my first ever ghost burger with ghost peppers because I wanted to live dangerously. Full of flavor and sneaks up on you. While I could only eat half my leftovers were just as good the next day.  The place is small and the wait can get long so get there early

I love café zupas as it's fresh food, freshly prepared and not overpriced. The people are genuine and provide a great experience. They have fresh soups, salads, and great sandwiches. Every meal comes with a free chocolate covered strawberry. Great location, people and food. It doesn't get better then this.

Great little place to see a play! While browsing around Glendale think of getting a bite to eat or wander around and see one of their shows. It's a small intimate theater for live entertainment and a small crew and cast. They have matinee shows and some evenings. We recently went on a Sunday to see "The 12 days of Christmas" which is the story of a couple who have been together for 12 years and after he doesn't propose and she breaks up with him she kindly gives him 12 Days to win her back. We love love love live shows that are imaginative and heartwarming and hope to see more in the future. They also offer an unlimited pass for all the shows they do should you want to give a gift to someone. Support the arts and live theater!

While parking can sometimes be an issue I think the staff do a great job in keeping this place clean and going strong 24/7. I love the massage chairs and table for the extra black card membership price. Definitely makes you feel welcome and non judgement environment fits the bill.

What's not to like about this entertaining production? Anyone who enjoys Christmas should attend and feel the joy. With falling snow every now and again on stage, and a wonderful choir that sang in perfect unison while standing on the set of the elaborate tree, it was a glorious evening I had the good fortune of having a great seat next to a lovely lady whose husband was in the choir along with her dear friend who played the angel. She told me they practice every week starting in September, and then the whole week before the production.  With fabulous costumes, amazing solo's, dancers, acrobats and puppets, I think people of all ages would enjoy this show. I know we would love to make it a yearly tradition ourselves.

Very much a pleasant experience as you wander through the lighted displays. But as my mother in law would say needs even more lights. Still it's clean and inviting and a great place to take your family. The kids are sure to enjoy it, and it definitely puts you in the Christmas experience.

If Starbucks had 1/2 the personality of Dutch bros it would be a miracle. Everyone who works here is friendly and helpful and the energy is always great. Would love to be able to see a menu earlier on as the drive thru is always busy. Would also love more variety maybe they have a secret menu I am not privy to? Finally got hubby to come here and if they had a sit in area this place would blow you know who out of the water!

I can't remember the last time I tried This chain because generally I don't gravitate to chains. A friend suggested meeting here for dinner so I complied. What a pleasant surprise it turned out to be! The service was top notch and the food  turned out to be quite good for a moderate price steakhouse. We shared a great appetizer of stuffed mushrooms. Very tasty! While the bread and salad were average the stuffed filet was cooked perfectly and was tender and tasty and seasoned!! Very important for a great steak.  I was very pleased overall with the meal and the price and wouldn't hesitate to return to this chain or location!

I've only been to Longhorn 3 times since I moved here 2 years ago. I must say that all 3 times its been excellent with the best service around- I even remember my servers name from two years ago- Ray! Longhorn's motto is "fresh, never frozen" so it was a delight to get to eat here again for an event. What I like best about Longhorn is that they aren't afraid to season their meats. So many times hubby and I have dined out and paid $$$$ for a steak that may have been a nice cut, but lacked any flavor whatsoever. What impressed me about this place is that you can tell your server to either go easy on the seasoning, or the way they usually  do it or go heavier. I want a steak with flavor, baby! I also don't want any fat and I don't want it to look like it was just taken from the animal, so  no pink for me. Usually when I ask for well done they want to burn the steak. In the case of tonight's meal it was cooked to perfection and not burned. It was also easy to cut into and eat. It was the perfect portion for me on their summer menu- the pepper crusted filet with shrimp along with a loaded Idaho potato. We had a variety of appetizers to try, with my favorite being the wild west shrimp. My least favorite would be the fried green tomatoes. The breading fell off and it just wasn't good. Being a big bread person, the bread too fell short of my expectations and wasn't anything special to write home about. The Blue ridge wedge salad was nicely presented and good. The hand shaken margarita's are very nice. GET one! We were also served sweet corn fritters, hand battered portabello, brew pub pretzel sticks. but again my hands down favorite would have to be the wild west shrimp. I did have a taste of the brew Pub pretzel sticks and they were good but I am not sure how they fit in with everything else offered on the appetizer menu. Dessert of course is my favorite part of any meal, and I am a solid chocolate person and the chocolate stampede did not disappoint. The peach cobbler is amazing and I know my husband wouldn't share if he had that in front of him. A solid GREAT meal with a not so pricey tag compared to those high end steakhouses! When you want steak to be the star of your meal, then go here!

Since Dr. Kurt arrived and I have been seeing him on a regular basis I have noticed a huge improvement. I sit at a desk all day typing on a computer. I have noticed a huge improvement since he started working more on my neck. The prices are reasonable when on a payment plan. You can go every week if you want to and the hours are convenient. They also have two doctors now on staff reducing the times you may have to wait when busy. It's worth the money.

Very excited to try this place as we had never been before. This location is huge and we had no wait for a table this Sunday morning. Our waitress was efficient and friendly. The food was excellent and no complaints at all. The biscuit beignets were out of this world served warm with homemade marmalade. It was the favorite part of our entire meal but not free so you have to pay for them (I would eat the whole plate myself if they were free). Hubby went with the Floridian omelet that comes with breakfast potatoes. He had a side of Andouille sausage and was very pleased with his meal. I went all out and had the Cinnamon roll French toast, which was delicious as well. The hand glazed mugs they use for coffee are very cute and you can purchase them. My only complaint is that it was a very expensive breakfast with the sides we ordered, and not something we would do all of the time.

I would honestly give 2 1/2 stars if possible and here is why. 1.Parking is crazy. Once you park you have to back out of the lane because there is only one way to go. 2. List 3 haunted houses but honestly 2 1/2 and that is stretching it. The Maze part (Chaos)  at the end is not worth the wait- and you have to wait in line even if you have a fast pass which we had.  The props in the first and best attraction was   "The crypt" and worth a visit. I would have them expand that haunted house and ditch the other two. If you want to try it go with the Fast pass.

One of my concerns with relocating was finding great places that provide the quality I am used to. Luckily, through yelp I found this place and decided there was no better birthday gift then a reflexology hour. I am pleased to report that they lived up to my expectations! I had made an appointment for the weekend, and I didn't have to wait (which means the world to me). The sessions are given in private rooms and no rush, you get the full hour so you don't have to worry about being "shorted" for the time you pay for. It was worth it and I intend to make it a regular thing. The prices are reasonable and the service is excellent.

Usually we find with celebrity places that the impression outweighs the quality of what we anticipate we are going to have.  Such is not the case with Buddy V. The food was amazing from grands meatballs to egg frittata and red velvet cake. We went for brunch and between both of us tasted all we could with no complaints at all. The service was great and everything tasted homemade from family recipes. We didn't eat again the rest of the day and there was something for everyone (except fish) since its Italian. I do have a suggestion though: If you are eating at Buddy's how about providing a menu for the pastry shop across the way and having those to go orders ready and waiting. Having to wait in line shouldn't be something you have to do if you have already splurged on the meal. Pricey but worth it. Reservations recommended'

A solid pizza joint best for take out. Every bite resembles utopia in a slice of pizza. Lovingly made by hand with the freshest ingredients and not your chain pizza place.  Only downside to report is not enough variety and not really a great dine in area but otherwise excellent. The reason they don't drown the pizza in their homemade sauce is because they want you to taste the ingredients and we find that refreshing and love that about them. It's definitely a must try place and who knew Mexican pizza was so delicious!

My favorite place to go for pedicure and fill-ins because it's clean and they remember me there and what I like done. Appointments run on time. No complaints and I appreciate the music I like playing so I can hum along.

I loved the look of this place from the outside so I decided to give it a try. So glad I did. From excellent customer service that is fast and friendly to a clean welcoming environment that brings nostalgia to mind. It's exactly the kind of place my parents would have taken us to in the old days. Black checked floors and red booths and chairs. Order at the counter and they call your number when ready everything is cooked to order. I had the patty melt combo and it was perfectly cooked with crunchy bread. The shoestring fries are good and since the burger was so tasty I decided to try their custard. Excellent in terms of everything and  I know I will be back.

Ever since we visited our favorite one in Nc, it's great to have found one here in AZ. Not in phoenix, sadly. Think of Cheddars as reasonably priced with something for everyone, but on a higher scale. It's an American bistro with good size portions and tasty food. Never ever skip the buttered croissants! Those are the best! My tip to you....

In your typical strip center shopping center, the warm and friendly service and clean family type environment reminded us of many places we visited in our past.  It's Italian and without really looking at the menu we thought it was going to be more deli type food.  We arrived too late for breakfast but our waitress highly recommended the cheesesteak sandwiches with a order of fries to share. The sandwich and fries were excellent and perfectly seasoned as well as being a great size. We would definitely go back again to try the Sunday brunch as well as a nice non rushed dinner.

Nothing like a local family owned Italian place! They serve breakfast lunch and dinner here and it's all good! Recent visit with a friend who had never been before was better then ever. Homemade gnocchi very flavorful and garlic bread perfect. Huge portions for leftovers the next day. Since turning on my friend with this local find she has been back once or twice already. Well worth the prices and friendly service.

We had high hopes for this haunted attraction, but found out early on no real screams coming from inside, only a long line with little shock value. Great outdoor entertainment and rest room facilities which was a plus. Paying for parking and no real directions where to go once parked are negatives. Fast pass only good for entry at the start but not once inside you wait like everyone else. First haunted house basically darkness with no real special effects. The 3d clown house was worth it and well done. The shootout part was disappointing. Good last effect with different rooms you are sent into chosen by the ghoul- not everyone goes the same way. Probably would rate 4th on our list of haunted attractions this year.

Close to Harkins movies at scottsdale and mayo, it's not easily visible from the street, but once you taste it your tastebuds won't soon forget.  I love the nostalgic interior and it's clean and inviting. It can get expensive which others have commented on. However you are getting a top notch experience with fresh ingredients and commercial worthy looking food. From locally sourced and healthy ingredients comes one of the best burgers I have ever had. Marinated for 24 hours in red wine, it's juicy without being greasy or dripping and holds together perfectly on the bun with exceptional flavor. The Cajun waffle fries are my favorite side. Hubby liked the Chicago dog which is gluten, nitrate and msg free. We have been here twice and the quality and taste shines thru. Worthy of more then a passing glance and certainly calorie worthy.

Wow wow wow! Yes that is three in a row. Having never been a fan of the whole chicken and waffle thing, we decided to try this place anyway. I always thought it was a strange combo but hubby seems to love it and who doesn't like fried chicken? I had the fried smothered chicken and worth every bite and I can atleast boast that while I wanted to eat the whole thing I showed great restraint and took half home. The homemade gravy was to die for and the moist chicken outstanding. I hate cornbread but honestly the best I have ever had is here. The Mac and cheese while excellent can never compare to my husbands, but with that being said it was worth every bite. Hubby of course had chicken and waffles with a side of dirty rice. He was equally impressed! Both of us now list this place as a must return to. Why only 4 stars? Perhaps because they close earlier then we would have wanted and there isn't one closer! Certainly worth the trip and drooling just thinking about going again!

Wow! A slice of heaven waffle style! Ordered the s'mores waffle and split with hubby. After just a taste though I could have had the whole thing myself. Good thing he was there to take 1/2. Tastes just like smores only on a waffle. Order at the front and they bring it out to you. I definitely want to go back for breakfast (served all day) so this won't be my only visit here.

I liked the laugh factory. Unlike other clubs where you can't move because of being jam packed in. There are individual tables to be seated at- and that's a big plus to me. Drinks were reasonable even with a 2 drink pp minimum and it's an easily affordable evening out for two or more. I can definitely see us returning for more comedy and laughs.

Where have you been all my life, AMC with reclining chairs and reservations? Even the airlines don't treat you this well anymore! Best place I have EVER seen a movie. I am a regular now! Either go with a recliner or go somewhere else!

Feel like you want to hang out at a yacht club but have no yacht? Well then this is the place for you. Really great interior including bar area. Lobster rolls to die for! Lobster pasta good too although not quite as good as the lobster rolls.It's pricey but the food was great and definitely worth more then one visit. They also do happy hour on Saturdays. Enjoy the beachy vibe!

All I tasted was lard. Grease? Oil? Maybe they are better cooled but all the fuss (and calories) are lost on me. I tossed it after a few bites.

What a cute place with great sandwiches. I can see why this place is popular for a fast food type experience without the typical fast food.  I had the Italian beef sandwich which is a specialty of theirs and really delicious. Hubby went with the same only his was a combo with sausage added. Fries were great and it's a cool place to take the family, out of Towners or drive thru (they take your order in advance of getting to the window) Indoor and outdoor seating with checkerboard pattern. We will be going back again soon.

Certainly not lacking in quality! Fresh brewed teas of your choice and with combinations to try you might not have thought of. Home baked goodies which I couldn't resist that were delicious. They also have sandwiches which we will try next time. I love locally owned and managed businesses and while small on the inside, there is a patio on the outside to sit at. That would be my only reason for not getting 5 stars. If you are in the Litchfield area it's worth checking out. We met one of the owners Arlene and wish them great success. I know we will be back in the future.

Enjoyed our meal here. I went with the single cheddar and hubby did the double cheddar. Both were cooked to order and very tasty. We shared an order of fries with the cheese on the side to dip. Fries were just the right texture and also had the perfect amount of seasoning. We did not order any drinks. It was good but I am not sure it would be something I would crave and have to come back to.
