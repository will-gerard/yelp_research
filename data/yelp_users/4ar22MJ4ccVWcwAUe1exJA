Mmmm.... Friday date night with my handsome man is something I look forward to every week. And it's always Pei Wei! I feel like it's inexpensive for the delicious foods we get. (2 Kung Pao Chickens, no rice, extra vegies, steamed chicken. Crab Wontons or Pork Egg Rolls. AND 2 lemonades!) We  have never had any issues, except for the busser girl eye humping my boyfriend ;) and they are always quick!

My very handsome boyfriend and I frequent this place every time we fall off the diet wagon. it is delicious and naughty! Exactly what we need. We both get Hoegaarden on tap. *The soft pretzel appetizers are the best thing on the menu, so American!* We each get a dozen wings, fried and then grilled, of our own favorite flavors. And we get some onion rings to share.   The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because the service isn't always up to par, but I wouldn't expect it from a place like that. Shrugs. It's not a place for fine dining and great service, it's for beer and wings.

We had never been to Marie Callender's before, but my boyfriend wanted apple pie rull bad, and then we found out they had chili! So we went specifically for pie and chili. We ended up getting the appetizer sampler. Everything on it tasted the same, like we were eating fried cardboard with oil that hadn't been changed in 6 months. It was pretty gross. Then we got the chili and cornbread. The corn bread was ok, but the chili lacked meat, substance, annnnd flavor. It was almost like soup, and super bland for being, "famous." Then we got 3 slices of pie because we couldn't decide on which ones. The pumpkin was banging to say the least, best pumpkin pie I've ever had, I'll give them that. The apple was good, better with ice cream. But the chocolate satin pie we got was horrible, it was so rich we couldn't eat it and it was textured like sand in your mouth, gritty. Ewe. The server was not attentive, forgot to refill drinks after we ran out, and then asked for more, and then when she gave us our check we SPENT SIXTY DOLLARS!? $60? Holy..... Nothing on the check was wrong, but dang, we spend less when we go out drinking. I will never go to a Marie Callender's again. Pretty lame, super expensive, unimpressive food, poor service.  However, I would purchase a pumpkin pie to go for Thanksgiving.

Trading in my clothes at Buffalo Exchange was one of the most humiliating and dehumanizing experiences I have ever had, no really.  I have a bunch of cool stuff, in good enough condition for a used clothing store, that I wanted to trade in for some new-to-me jeans for school. I prefer to recycle. I waited an hour for my turn. The people behind the counter were snooty. They looked at me, and my stuff, like we were disgusting. It was embarrassing! The guy that "helped" me, asked the girl next to him about every item he thought he might buy. After going through the three bags of cool stuff I brought in, he was going to buy two brand new pairs of shoes that I never wore, and a couple of items of clothing. A girl came up to take over his shift?? and she did not accept anything of mine that he was going to, except for the two brand new pairs shoes. I was mad. After they gave me 22 bucks trade I looked though what they had on the racks, and my stuff was in way better condition, AND way cooler.   The only reason they get two stars is because I did find a rocking pair of Lucky Jeans that only ended up costing me 7 bucks.

I support local business, recycle everything, eat clean, and consume as much used product as I possibly can. If you're anything like me, Changing Hands Bookstore is the place to spend your hard earned money. Everyone in there makes you feel welcome, from the cashiers to the stockers and your fellow shoppers. I also actively participate in many of the events held by Changing Hands. (Book signings, language classes, discussion groups, workshops, ect.) Oh and if they don't have what you're looking for in stock, they will gladly order it.  Get involved.

Um, the works pizza we ordered was smashed to one side, so we called back to get a replacement. The girl replied, "Well, we could send you a fresh one, but it wont be like 5 minutes, it would be more like a half hour. Or we could credit you for a large, one topping pizza." Um, not a works like we ordered? So we dug into the extra cheese only to find it under cooked. Ewe. When calling for a full refund because we didn't want to eat this crap, the guy who answered this time was very compliant, but never even said he was sorry for the hassle, or the crappy pizza. Bummer, I liked Hungry Howie's Pizza, but we wont order from this place again.

I prefer this location over the one in Tempe. It's less crowded and less hipster. I always sit at the bar, it has the most lighting in the place. The food is always on point. The cooks are super friendly, the servers don't pay much attention but I can over look that because the cooks always get me what I need, with out so much as even a blink. The music is always in good taste. And I am always in good company. I'd like to say this is one of my favorite restaurants to visit, when I'm not watching my weight. :)

We had a Groupon for this place and decided to try it out on a Sunday night, before we left for a trip to Thailand. We were lucky we were the second table in, because six or seven more tables walked in and there was one server, literally running, from table to table. Needless to say, the service was few and far between, and non-personable.   The chile paste on the table looked like it had been there for weeks, seriously ewe. The crab puff and spring roll appetizers were greasy, and probably from Costco. For dinner we ordered curry with hot spice, drunken noodles with hot spice, pad Thai with medium spice, and chicken and broccoli with medium spice. NONE of our food came out with any spice in them??? Lame, who wants non spicy Thai food? So being unable to use the month old chile paste on the table. It was all bland, unimpressionable, and kinda gross.   The curry tasted like chicken and veggies with coconut milk as a dressing. The drunken noodles was the same dish as the chicken broccoli, except one had rice and the other had noodles. And the pad Thai was pretty greasy as well. Oh, and I forgot we ordered wonton soup, and so did our server. After he brought it out when we were done with the meal, it was basically the same dish as the drunken noodles and chicken broccoli but it was in a bowl of hot water. Weird. And not appetizing at all.    We love Thai food and we were trying to eat a lot of it before our travels, and this was by far the worst place we've tried. Super disappointed in their lack of staff and how gross the food was. Sorry, but you should be better  prepared for a Groupon, those things sell.   We will never go back.

The first time we stepped into this place we fell head over heals in love! It's got everything we've ever wanted! The place was clean for a buffet, the guys behind the counter were nice and laughed at my jokes, the yogurt was delicious and the variety of toppings was awesome!   I would only change one thing about Zoyo, the availability of smaller cups. It makes for a hard battle of will power when the only options are large, and extra large.

I would recommend every one of the artists at this shop, on a personal and a professional level. You could not ask for more talent, honesty, laughter and good people in a single tattoo parlor. Go see for yourself.
