The corn bread tastes like sand. The pork on my ribs was about to jump out of my plate and start running that's how under cooked it was. It almost made an oinking sound. The best part was not getting any napkins or forks or basically anything when I got it Togo. The beans were good... So are the ones I buy at my nearest grocery store. So sad can't even believe these people sell cooked food. They should just become like a meat and deli spot. Cold uncooked meat. I hate suggesting places on my reviews but I suggest Famous Dave's or the long drive to Bobby Q.

This place lacks everything.. The food is disgusting. I threw up after I ate there food. It's just not good. It's sucks because Arizona lacks culture foods. Id rather go to Panda Express than step foot in that place.

I honestly don't even know how people say "best staff" this Panda is pathetic I've came here for the past years and lately wow has it been bad. I've seen a couple of new faces and I've seen this lady that works there but I've seen her at different places she's the worst out of them all. I came at 9:30 with 30 minutes left yeah it was kinda late but you can't pull that as a major excuse my parents own a restaurant and you don't see us doing this. I brought 6 people with me not including me and we all got the worst service with them they gave us the death look and they weren't even responding do us just speaking in there language. We see that everything is gone literally everything and they didn't even manage to say we'll make new stuff or anything we just started laughing and we just ended up eating the trash that they gave us. By far the worst panda experience. Sorry I've never gave a review like this but they deserve it.

Place is small, the food is limited to on what you want. It's a nice place for a quick grab for lunch. Nothing extreme but nothing bad. Place is an alright spot. Been here for years finally went in to try it. Will be back but won't be my first choice of food.

Fish Taco Tuesday is the greatest thing ever created. I get like 8 for my self. They are amazing and fresh and cheap. The place is nice and I love the salsa bar! I can be here everyday to be honest! You want good American Mexican food I would come here.

I like coming to this place. It's bright inside with good amount of seats. Has a couple TVs and Bar. I've only orders the Carna Asada burrito. They give you chips for free which is nice and they have a good salsa bar. The salsas are good I just wished it was a little bit more tasty and different. The music just kills me I know it's a Mexican place so they put Spanish songs or whatever but I just don't like it while I'm trying to enjoy my meal. They can put some Instrumental music or something like that from the Spanish country. Also the workers are very bad with customer service. Not one time do they ask you anything which is very bad. That's why it's a 4 star.

Love love love! Always busy in here but they are super fast and it's always super hot! I love coming here before going to the gym get a nice breakfast burrito. Yes a burrito at a bagel shop. Everything here is just amazing! The staff are friendly and always helpful. I perfect this location over the Happy Valley one because the staff there looks mad and not happy to work. Work is work be happy make me want to come back! This place is 100% a 5 out of 5 stars! The best fast breakfast place in Arizona.

Best sushi in Glendale. The place isn't too big but it's worth the wait if it's packed. I love it and the people aren't mad that they are at work they are happy. Love this place! Way better then Ah-So or Squid Ink. Place is amazing.

Don't get the negative reviews. This place is amazing. Way better than Starbucks I can tell you that. Takes long for the coffee because it's real and not pre made like Starbucks the staff is nice but wish they would talk more and be more energetic like Starbucks or Dutch Bros. Love the Coffee and the place is nice. You want real Coffee for a good price this is the place.

Everybody talks about this place and how amazing it is. So my friends wanted to go after a long night of not eating. We had a 30 minute wait so we sat outside. We sat down and ordered our food. I got the KK's. Everything on that sounded good they give you 2 eggs also with cheese and onion and I asked for no cheese or onion. I also ordered side French fries. I got my food and noticed cheese and onions on my eggs I asked for new ones because I didn't want that. I also did not get the French fries I didn't bother asking I wanted to see if they would put it on my tab at the end. They brought out new eggs and they weren't even cooked. Like literally my friends were also disgusted. If you moved the plate you could see the egg white just bouncing around. It wasn't wear like it was just the yolk not cooked it was every part of the egg so I didn't eat it. The fried chicken is good and so are the waffles which why I was satisfied because of those but it's nothing to WOW about. I had a very bad experience and honestly this will not be my choice for breakfast. Also at the end my tab had fries on it so I told them I didn't get it the guy went "oh okay" and took it off but did not even apologize or anything else.

I have no idea where to start on this review. How about the wait time? I think so. So we walk up in front we see a lot of people waiting which is reasonable knowing it's Sunday morning. I tell the girl I need a table for 7 and she said about 35 minutes or any time before that. That's not a bad wait time to be honest so we sat down and waited. I wanted some coffee so I got into the car and went and got coffee and came back and my friends were still sitting outside waiting at this time it's been about 45 minutes so I go up and ask her how much longer and she say 5 minutes. Another 15 minutes passed by before they call our name so over an hour of waiting time... Table and terrible you're so close to other people's table there no sense of privacy and you can hear everyone's conversations. How about they make the gift store place smaller and give more room for the restaurant itself. I ordered some meat thing and asked for only bacon and scrambled eggs. It was good for like an appetizer. I ate it in like 2 minutes all of it. Kinda sucked. The corn bread is gross. The waitress FLO was legendary made us laugh that's the only reason I gave this place 2 stars. Haha. Thanks for a good time FLO but I won't be seeing you anytime soon.

Where do I start? A beautiful morning needed some good breakfast a couple of my friends suggested to come here. Me I did not want to because of the 3 and half stars on Yelp and reading a couple of reviews. But I always like to try places because everyone has a different opinion. We got there and they told us a 45 minute wait. It was nice outside so we suggested to wait because any place would be busy at that time. So we waited the 45 minutes and they call us inside. I look at the menu and I had no idea what to order. No like suggestions or Stars by popular plates how most places have it now. So I asked our waitress she gave me a couple options and I went with Border Bowl. From the description it sounded amazing. Bacon, ham, hash browns, etc. So I ordered that and their tomato soup. The soup wasn't soup it was like tomato sauce from a can.. Literally.. And right when my plate came out I looked for my bacon. I then found out it's like shredded bacon.. Very disappointed. The description didn't explain any of it or have any pictures. So I ate and I can eat a lot of food. On my 6th bite I couldn't do it. My stomach wasn't allowing it. It wasn't really bad. It just wasn't acceptable. My friends ordered the same thing and felt the same way. So I paid my 25$ breakfast.. Didn't know I had filet mignon. My stomach did not accept any of this food. I wanted to get it out of my system so bad but I just couldn't. I really was disappointed and im truly never coming back here again. Also the iced coffee there's a big poster outside about it and it looked so good and it has a special name so I thought this ice coffee was going to be BA. I think McDonald's ice coffee is better. Just truly wasn't satisfied. At least the women are good looking but got an attitude. Customer service was alright. 2 star joint. I would prefer something different maybe McDonald's breakfast?

We came here around 3pm with nobody being here but us which was pretty nice because it was quite. We ordered two hookahs and they came out fast. The charcoals were black and not even ready yet. Charcoal needs to be really hot and ready to give out.. They turned black instantly. The flavor didn't even taste like lemon mint we had two of them... On Yelp there's a 10% off checkin which I checked in and wanted to use it. The guy working didn't know how to use it till I guess the manager came and had to like sign in which took like 5 extra minutes. My bill was originally 20$ and the guy goes so it's 20$ after the 10% off... I just didn't want to deal with it anymore because I think anyone can do what's 10% of 20$ in their head.. I just payed my 20$ and left. Why have a promotion for checking in and not even being able to use it or know how to do it for the customers. The only reason I gave this place was a two star was the guy tried keeping a conversation and the patio is nice during this time..

Honestly only place I eat at when I come to the mall. Everything else is disgusting. This place has a wide selection of cheesesteaks. My favorite is the ChicagoLand and get the 12 inches one! So much cheese!! I love it I also get a side of fries and some cheese so I can dip them in the cheese! Best thing if you're at the mall! Cooked fresh right in front of your face!

Late Sunday night and everyone was hungry and we wanted burgers and sushi and tacos haha everyone was craving something. I look on Yelp on what's opened now because it's 11pm on a Sunday and this place comes up. So we said why not it has a lot of reviews and 4 stars is good for all those reviews. We get there around 11:45 and it was seven of us so when the guy asked us how many he knew it was a struggle because at nearly 12am this place was packed on a Sunday. He told us only outside is available for our party of seven which is fine they provide heaters so no ones really cold. We order Sake bombs and sushi and burgers and honestly for what I had on my own was good. The tiger and Vegas rolls were good. The tiger roll is more on the spicy side and a Vegas roll everyone should know what that is if you eat sushi. But they did lack on service they slacked on coming back. But for a party of seven shouldn't you give us more attention than a party of 2? The waitress was cool when we threw some drunk jokes out there she started to laugh and comment back. Also outside its impossible to see your menus you have to grab the candle or the flashlight on your phone. It's got a nice feeling it to it tho. I like the place the foods good they just need to work on service especially being such a busy place. Also very small and bathrooms are cool haha.

Eden's Grill Inn is just outstanding.. This place is an authentic Mediterranean and Greek mix that's serves fresh and healthy food. This family owned place is incredible the staff is always energetic and want the best for you. The chicken kabob plate is untouchable the freshness the flavor and it's amazing how juicy the chicken is itself. The inside of this place is very clean and very well taken care of.. If you want some liquor with your food that won't be a problem at this amazing place. I recommended people to save room for dessert because oh my oh my.. Everything they make here is amazing and it's a experience you don't want to miss because Pita Jungle and my big fat Greek are not real food and they stop you from enjoying something that is good and something someone puts effort to make good for the people..

I got the full slab of Louisiana Style Ribs and two sides. The food came out in about 7 minutes and they were busy. I hate everything off the plate the people sitting at the table next to me where just looking at me confused because of how fast and how much food i ate. The food was steaming hot and delicious every bite was heaven. I can say this place is fast delicious and very clean. The guy upfront who seats you down seemed a little sleepy and tired but that's the only complaint I have. Loved this place and I can't wait to go back and bring my friends. I wish I could give them a 6 star to be honest!

Interesting old design! The workers are very friendly, seems like a family owned joint which is so much better! It's clean and the food is very BBQY and good! Just sucks because it's such small portions so if you decide to just get a sandwich I would get another one to really full you up. TVs are old and disgusting it's 2015! Get some new ones for god sakes!!

This place has bad reviews. But I've never had a problem here. I've been here about 4 times. Each time I get seated right away and I get asked if I want something to drink. The female working are always good looking which is a plus. I order wings with some fries on the side I enjoy them more than going to buffalo wild wings. They are fast and hot always. This place is a good spot also a good place to watch some sport games. It is too dark inside this spot and it's kinda dirty.

I don't know where to start on this place. I had no idea this place was going to be so different and nice. When you arrive outside you can see all these trees and the environment in a whole is just outstanding. The way you order is kinda weird you walk In grab a menu and wait in line. The menu tries to help you out on what's like popular like some of the items have been on the food channel so it tells you that which is cool. But after all that I still did not know what to order, everything sounded so good! I just went with a slab of ribs and 2$ up charge for garlic fries and a drink was about 26$.. Isn't bad to be honest it's like going to any sit down and getting ribs but with sit downs they do everything for you while here you have to do it that's the only down side. This place is like a fast food joint with high prices. They give you a buzzer device so when the food is ready it starts vibrating. The fountain machine is outside and so are the sauces and all the things you need for your meal even a sink which is different and nice. My meal came out in like 5 minutes while they were busy and it was incredible. The ribs were tasty, the garlic fries were perfect and the coleslaw was probably the best coleslaw I have had. The food the environment is just so cool sitting outside with a heater and so much green around you. Very nice place I will be back!

Honestly I love how this place looks. It's so modern with the design. You walk in and it's a chalk menu which makes it even cooler. The staff was friendly but could be a little more outgoing. I ordered a Carmel latte and it tasted so fresh and good. It wasn't too sweet so I was even happier. This place is cool but it's just boring. You walk in and walk out unless you're staying for HW or something else. It just doesn't have a welcoming feel. Add some TV's or some sort of entertainment. The outside seating is nice and I like how they have that. The place was also very clean. So if you're around and wanna walk around and enjoy the environment and have some good coffee this is a good place for that.

This place really has four stars???... My friends recommend it and looking at Yelp I was excited for a "good" breakfast place.. Oh was I wrong.. The service was good but the food was terrible. The bacon was soggy and and gross. The hash browns are literally pathetic.. They taste like nothing at all... My friend got cheese and onions on his to make it a little better. When the waitress came and asked how the food was I replied with the hash browns are terrible. She goes "should of got it like your friends" oh sorry I didn't know I had to get them a specific ways they are hash browns and it's my first time.. The biscuit.... Give you three gigantic biscuits that are just gross.. No flavor at all. No butter.. Looks like they just didn't care when they were making them.. Place was also very hot and also had no connection.. I just don't think this is the right place for breakfast..

This spots nice! I love the scenery and the seating the workers are amazingly nice and have a lot of energy to start a conversation with you the sushi is good but my favorite is the Burger. (used to be called kobe burger but not made with real kobe meat so they had to change the name) The burger is outstanding for a sushi spot like I don't get it I guess this place just has it all right! Good spot!

I want to say this is probably the greatest sushi spot I've ever had. The staff is fantastic always coming to you asking if you need anything. The sushi was fantastic the flavors. The worker helped me out choosing what to get. Whoever wants a good sushi spot I recommend this place over any other place. Also happy hour 3-5 is amazing.

This place is amazing it always hits the spot after you eat there.. The chicken is amazing the gyros is amazingly cut into thin juicy pieces.. This place is an automatic 5-Star joint.. One more thing the people are amazingly friendly and have a great sense of humor.. If you haven't tried it you're missing out!

Obviously you can't go wrong with In-N-Out probably the greatest fast food burger. But it's doesn't deserve a five star because of the workers up front. Most of the time I always get the same Hispanic guy. He sits there with this face showing you he doesn't wanna work. Yeah in n out gets busy but they get paid good and everything is simple and ready to go and he works the cash register so I don't get why he's always mad. But he's mad and doesn't ask you how your day is or anything. If you're getting paid good just being a cash register at least speak up and see how your customers are doing.

Ranked 3 busiest Starbucks in AZ! Cut them some slack people!! Always busy all day! With some good customer service what else do you want?! Yes the only bad is they take pretty long for a drink when you go inside but drive thru is fast.

Honestly this beats subway, Jimmy Johns, and Fire House. They have a great amount of selection you can also build your own but it's not as good as subways build your own. But the Philly Cheese Steak sells me it all. The taste is just amazing always hot even when you're 5 bites in. With a side of chips and a drink nothing can be better. Fast service and great workers.

Can't believe this place is packed all the time. People are wasting their money and time eating at this place. This is not "Greek" or "Mediterranean" or anything close to that. This is a washed down version. Real authentic Greek meat need to be on the cone that spins around and they cut it from the cone and it falls in a pan. That's how gyros or Shawarma is suppose to be. The chicken "shawarma" that I had was just chicken breast cut into small little pieces put into this "pita" that they use that's not even cooked right because the juice destroys the pita and everything comes out on your plate and it starts looking like a salad. This is not real Greek food. Their are so many good mom and pop places you can go to and get the real feel of Greek food. This is just stopping you from a great experience. I do not prefer this place to anyone who knows food but those people who are controlled by generic will stay and keep coming back. Open your eyes people.

I work right next door and when I get a break I go get myself a smoothie they have a good variety of smoothies and other stuff like sandwiches. I've never ate here, just doesn't look like a food type of place. But the smoothies are fantastic the workers need to work on their verbal skills. They don't really know how to talk to people. But it's okay I'd rather have you not talk and make me a good smoothie or talk and make me a shitty one.

I don't understand how a hotel with such a name can be so bad??.. So many people talk about The W like Drake for an example "I'm at the W but I can't meet you in the lobby" but this W isn't the same like the rest. The others are bigger and the rooms here just feel cheap. You're paying this high price for a room that's not even the size of a regular bedroom at home. They have LG TV's from like 2007. In this Scottsdale area you shouldn't have anything so cheap especially if your rooms are so expensive for no reason. They give a speaker that connects to IPhone 4's... Like? What? I stayed here randomly and didn't have a tooth brush guess what? They didn't have one either? With this W being in Old Town places with bars and clubs you'd expect them to have these things because a lot people get a room randomly and don't drive home so you should have these things for them. Also there are no balconies just a window that opens again doesn't make any sense. For the price I would say no. If you compared to a motel 6 I would say the motel 6 has probably all the same things this place has. Save your money and find a different hotel. The only reason this place gets two stars was the staff members downstairs called me boss at 5am when I was coming in drunk.

Place is good. If you want some good fish tacos I would consider this place! It's quite but it's nice the variety of drinks is nice too. The workers look like they don't wanna be there but it doesn't bother me. I would consider this place if you want something different but good!

Early morning waking up from a bad night of drinking and just in pain because you have no food in your system?... Well that was me like every Sunday morning in old town. Woke up and right away my friends go "Find something good on Yelp" well okay if you say so. Looking at a couple different options and scrolling through pictures Daily Dose caught my eyes. The pictures people were posting looked amazing and the reviews were on the positive side so i said lets go to Daily Dose!! Scratch that I drove I just told everyone to get into the car I didn't care what they had to say. Haha, arriving around 12:30pm there was a waiting time of 30 minutes but after when my friend pulled out this driver license to show it was his birthday she said she would let us in a little early if she found a spot for the 6 of us. Sat down outside with complimentary coffee for the wait which is very nice addition knowing they are always busy if they have that. She called our name out in about 10 minutes of waiting which was nice. We sat down and our waitress was very nice with us and I asked her a couple of questions and she said go with the Breakfast Nachos and oh I did..  I got the Salsa and the Pico on the side and also added Bacon... These were the best Nachos I have ever had in my life.. The cheese was melted perfectly the scrambled eggs and bacon on top was amazing and so was this dipping sauce they had it was like soup. The service was fast and amazing they messed up on the birthday boys nachos but fixed it right away with no issue and apologized for it. The seating is nice and they also have TV's. This place was the cure for me that Sunday morning. First breakfast place I've actually enjoyed, can't wait to come back!!

This place is terrible. The girl taking my order was so quite I couldn't even hear what she was was saying. None of the workers care about you and they seem like they wanna kill themselves. I ordered the scrambled breakfast...... This is where everything turns bad. The eggs were brown... Last time I check scrambled eggs are yellow not brown... I tasted it and it had no taste at all not even some salt something we're wrong with these eggs. It comes to bacon two small strips thank god those were okay. Also two pieces of toast so small.. This breakfast is for kids not for men that are hungry. Very sad to see paradise bakery going down and Panera buying out every location.. This is just bad please do not order breakfast here I have no idea how lunch is but breakfast is terrible what a waste for 7$ I'd rather go spend 7$ at McDonald's and get breakfast there and I would actually enjoy every bite of it!! Get new staff and a new chef!! This place is terrible!!!!

I didn't know this place was a sit down restaurant I thought it was going to be fast food but I was in shock when we got seated. I ordered two appetizers for my table the fried pickles and the buffalo chips. The fried pickles I thought were going to be slices which they should be because it's very difficult to eat the fried pickle in a whole when it's hot. The buffalo chips with the hot sauce and blue cheese on top was just incredible such a simple idea that makes you so happy you got them. So I saw the build your own burger thing on the menu and decided to do that because I like making it my own. So sad knowing all the stuff I asked for went to waste because they got the main thing wrong for a burger. I asked specifically medium well and I got well done with no juice left in the patty. There was no taste in the meat. It was gross I didn't even wanna look at it to be honest. Burger place but the meat has no taste to it? Kinda weird no? I like fries on the side they were called Parm Fries or something those were tasty. Buffalo chips and fries are the only thing good here. 45$ for two burgers and one appetizer.. Plus a tip? So 50+$? Not worth it..

This place is just incredible.. Real tasty pizza! This place is just simple and good. The staff is amazing! Love coming here because I always leave smiling and in a good mood. The pizza comes out fast, hot, and tasty! If you want good pizza around this area you should eat here. Better than spending your money on Dominos or Pizza Hut.

I have no idea where to start on this review.. This place is just phenomenal.. Right when I walked in I knew i was at the right place, with all the sodas everywhere and the place was packed with people. When I looked at the menu I was lost because it had so many things. I saw the New Yorker Burger and I said this has to be amazing with some fries and a nice creme soda! I also added a side of mini corn dogs because who wouldn't???.. The girl helped me out also on if my choice was good and she said yes that's one of the popular items. She was nice and kept saying thank you. After I ordered I went to the fridges with all the sodas and I was literally lost.. I had no idea on what to get so many choices and so many things I didn't know about. I wanted to try one of everything to be honest. I grabbed creme soda and sat down. Waited about 5 minutes and the food came out, so the service was excellent too. The burger was fantastic the coleslaw with the pastrami that just melts into your mouth so juicy so good. The fries are seasoned so perfect not having a lot of salt like most seasonings. The corn dogs were as expected so amazing.. This place is just incredible and I can't wait to come back to try other things!! Just wish it had more room and not one bathroom.. But it's okay I like the old feel to it! If you want good food this is your place!

This is the worst Buffalo Wild Wings on earth in my opinion haha.. Let me start going into detail on why this place is terrible.. I arrived here around 10:00 which is two hours before their closing time. Walked in and saw that only a couple groups were in there being a it was a Monday night.. We walked up to the booth and there was no server there.. We waited for about 3 minutes before a girl approached us.. She told us sit anywhere we want so I was walking and she goes "don't pass the right side" so there goes sit anywhere.. We sat down ordered drinks and food and I'm waiting and waiting and I don't even see the server to even ask her where my appetizer is. She comes out with the food 35 minutes later and it was only us and another group sitting in this Buffalo Wild Wings. My fries were cold my wings were cold and my fried pickles were cold hahaha crazy how most of these food were fried and came out cold.. I didn't even want to bother with it being already late so I just paid and left but now I know I learned my lesson. Get your stuff together BWW!!

My friend and I came here for lunch he suggested it he told me this place has it all. This place feels family owned right when I walked in I got greeted by a kid and he asked me what I wanted I got then pulled pork with down fries and a drink it came up to 11 something. Price isn't bad I can't complain when I go to BBQ places. The BBQ sauce was incredible it was not too sweet it was just perfect I wish I could explain it some more but I just can't I just wanted to drink it that's how good it is and I love how it at every table and they aren't a cheap family because most places cry over extra sauce. This place was clean and I liked the things on the wall multiple things like shirts and banners it kept me busy while eating. Fantastic place I couldn't find anything wrong at this place. I really like it and it's well worth the price and drive if you live far.

Place is small but nice, chairs aren't so comfortable for me. Let's start off by saying the service is excellent. The people are nice and they talk unlike most places! The best thing is the Teriyaki sauce holy that thing is tasty you can put it on anything the foods good I've tried a couple of things. The spots good just would like to see some TVs and different music.

I had an excellent time here with all my friends, family, and randoms sitting close by. It was a very simple come in they check ID and if you want to find a place and sit down you can or you can just stand by the bar. We found a table and sat down and ordered 2 hookahs and some drinks and just enjoyed ourselves our waitress or whatever they call it there she was very nice and fast and I had no problems with her. Everyone here is chill laid back and everyone just has a good time to some middle eastern music or like 30 minutes of English haha. The hookah was good lasted us a long time which I was very shocked because a lot of these places don't really care and you get what you get but this was excellent. The bathroom is only one person so when it's busy you know you'll be waiting for a while. Also their is a security guy at the bathroom that tells you when to go in and out I have no idea what that was for but he was there all night. Place is nice, hookah was good, and the people are excellent. If you want to have a good time I suggest coming here.

Subs aren't bad. Nice different choices. Love the coke machine with 120+ flavors and the chips variety. The seating sucks barley fits two people and the tables are barley apart from eachother so every seating is made awkward because you're sitting close to a person eating his sub. The tv makes the place a little bit more better and the workers are nice and friendly. Overall this place is good.

Family owned place. Really nice and has enough room for any time. It has a lot of different types of foods so it's not limited to a few. It's a good Mexican spot in a good location. Place is nice and food is good also. Nothing bad about this place to be honest.

I smoke a lot of hookah.. Literally a lot of hookah and I work on the east side so after work my friend wanted to go to the hookah bar. We ended up coming here because my friend has came here before and it was close to the airport because i had to pick up somebody. So we came in the girl that worked their was very nice she told us to sit down wherever and she came with menus. We ordered a Arabic tea pot and a orange head with orange creme and mint. They ran out of orange creme so we decided to go with blue mist. When the hookah came out.. The orange head was slanted so when you put the coals they would fall off. So we tried fixing it ourselves. Didn't really work. We had 3 coco charcs on their and it wouldn't light up so we put 4 and it was barley hitting. The hookah was terrible we literally just put like 5-6 charcs and smoke harshness over nothing and it was 28$ total. We paid and we left and we won't be coming back. No sense of good hookah. The chai was good but that's about it. 2 stars for the nice girl and the good chai.

Technically you can't review this place bad on the good side because you're making it. From what meats you want, to what spices you want, to what veggies you want and to he sauces. So if you mess up what you put than you won't be satisfied on the food. So if you don't know how to cook and you're going out to eat I don't prefer coming here because you will be lost. But to a person like me who loves to cook I enjoy coming here and trying different things. But let's start on how everything works, you walk in and you have to get seated. After being seated they come and ask what you want to drink and than they give you a card you put your name on and you go in the line and select what size you want and you start making your food. The prices are kinda dumb being Small to medium is like a dollar difference... And the median itself is pretty expensive considering you don't get any bread or any side with your meal. The happy hour Beer and Sake deals are really good. Place is clean always. Just need to add more things it's just boring. So only thing to eat is a bowl you make? No salad or soup? Overall it's not a bad place.

I wanna start off by saying I love the staff here. Right when I walk in I get a loud "hello" and they ask me about my day. They always have energy and they are always happy. The foods okay just regular burgers that any place can truly have. But I would consider this place over McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Etc... It just feels more fresh. I love this place the prices are a little high. But nothing I can really complain about. Can't seem to see why their are bad reviews.

Okay this place is connected to a Homosexual bar. It's very entertaining actually because they tried hitting on me. It's a very busy place we were here Thursday night around 12am and the line was to the street and we got our food ate and the line never stopped. The weekend I heard is even worse. Everyone loud, drunk, and just hungry for some good tacos. I call them gay tacos because everyone's happy and eating tacos or whatever else they want to order. The line wasn't really that long if you have some company with you to talk. The prices are amazing 1 taco is 1$ so I got ten with some horchata which was amazing! I paid about 13$ but I was hungry and I can eat so I can't complain on that. This play is just an amazing place to go if you're drunk or have a couple of friends and want some Gay tacos! Love it I will be back 100%!

Rehab burger needs to go to rehab.... All these great reviews but I don't know, are these people to drunk to notice that there's a lot of things going wrong because of it being close to old town maybe it's the liquor and they just don't care about anything. Well I was fully sober coming into this place. The girl upfront is clueless let's just say that I really don't want to be mean but they really hired a girl who doesn't know anything about a simple job of "Hi welcome to Rehab burger! How many do you have with you?? Would you like to be seated outside or inside???" I walk in and she was busy so she tells me she will be right there to help me when she's done so instead of blocking the door because the desk is right in front of the door and it being such a tight place I walked outside thinking she will help me. Two other people walk in and the girls at her desk just waiting.. So I'm like okay I guess she's don't doing what she's doing so after the people in front of are done I walk and she doesn't even take me before them which one makes no sense and she tells me 25 minutes of wait.... I perfectly see 3 tables open.. She also had a low voice so she mumbles and you have to ask her a couple times to repeat herself. She just shouldn't be doing that job I guess it's so hard to do (Sarcasm) so she said 25 minutes my friends getting mad because he sees the tables himself but I say I bet it won't take 25 minutes and he agrees. So we wait outside and she calls the other group in 5 minutes and us in 10 minutes and those tables still being empty she asks me if we wanted to sit at the community table.. I think that should of been a question before us waiting because there were multiple open spots so we took them we didn't even care. We sat and our waitress was very nice and was quick I give her props she should maybe switch positions with the other girl but I think that would make it worse i would probably order a cheese burger and get no cheese and she would probably ask me if I wanted cheese after getting the cheeseburger I ordered... Sorry for the joke let's put all jokes aside. I ask the girl what's the most popular and what's your favorite and to both of those was the Peanut butter jelly Sriracha sandwich. So hey why not let's try it.. One, way to much peanut butter that you can't taste the burger meat.. So what's the point of the meat?? And I didn't even taste Sriracha either it had no spice to it at all.. Maybe less peanut butter so we can enjoy the meat because if not just serve it with just toast. My fries were also cold with it being busy should I have fresh fries?? I was really confused. The prices are good the waitress was cool but the burger I got recommended was kinda disappointing..  And the girl in front just needs to find something else to do maybe make sense.. Next time I come here I'll make sure I'm drunk.

I don't even know where to start on this update. I stopped eating at chipotle because honestly it's not good and not consistent. I got a bowl with all the major components to making it good but it was far from good.  It just boring they need to add more options now, change it up a little aren't people sick of the same old stuff? Over and over again... They barley put any meat in the bowl anymore it's just filled with all the other things you shouldn't have more of like rice.. Even if you get light rice or no rice it's still not enough chicken. Maybe If you don't get all the other stuff they should make an expectation of putting some more meat? I don't know that's just a suggestion because you're still saving them money. Isn't it time to add some Sriracha?? It's kinda a big thing now. After she made my bowl she went and helped out the other people in line the other guy behind her was cutting up some stuff. So how am I going to get checked out?? I waited for about 2 minutes before someone came. The girl didn't even say it will like one second or I'm sorry. I just waited and waited. Staff sucks! Always new people. Chipotle is just played out and boring. Chipotle is just a snail in a race with cheetahs.

I was hoping they had a yelp. Wow oh wow this place is bad. I stayed at the Westin for 4 days. I ate at this place 3 times. All 3 times I regret spending my money and eating at this place. This place is horrible I mean horrible. The food is disgusting the workers seemed like they wanna kill them selves.... No lie.. This is probably the worst experience I've had with food. At least the chicken tenders were okay. So sad seeing such a beautiful hotel but such a bad restaurant. Don't spend your money here. Just go find somewhere else to eat even tho everything is far.

Best carpet cleaning service in Arizona. My friend told me about them they said he was amazing. So I said why not and try it out. It ended up being the best idea of all time. My carpet was clean it was amazing looking and the cost was very cheap. The price and the service is excellent! If anyone needs a carpet service this is where to go!

Love this Dutch bros.. Wow is it just amazing! The workers all always in an amazing mood and they always treat you like you're family! Love the vibe and the energy this place gives. My coffee is always amazing and they always know what to get you when you're clueless. Best Dutch bros I've ever been too. Love it!

16$ for a Italian sub with extra meat and combo with chips and soda?.. Why would I do that? Subway can do the same for 10$.. The process of it just annoying. No suggestions on what's good. Just names and you pick what you want it's like subway but complicated and expensive. It's like trying to do present day algebra homework without a Ti-84. It's just annoying and not worth it. Jersey Mikes makes it simple and so does Jimmy Johns. Subway has the make your own sub on lockdown even tho it's played out. Also no description on foods like there is but like 4 words. At least they have 5 different selections of chips.... Tables are small for four people. Customer service isn't any good. He saw me staring at the menu for a good 5 minutes and didn't say a word to me. Idk maybe try helping me out? Just not a good place to be honest. It's trying to get into the sub sandwich business and just fails.

I have came here about 5 times now. I've experienced this sober and not sober. At first I thought they were so good because I was drunk and anything is delicious when drunk. But ohhhhhh was I wrong. I wanted to try these before I got intoxicated and they were probably even better... I do prefer the chicken over the steak ones because they have more flavor in them. Also throw some of that guacamole sauce... These tacos change Mexican food for you. Nothing touches how good these are and I've had a a lot of Mexican food in my lifetime. Fresh, hot, and fast! The customer service is also amazing for how busy they are at certain parts of the night. One time I came and they were closing down and they gave us two free taco cards for each of us. So 6 free total! That's amazing if you ask me! All I can say is if you're around this area and you are intoxicated or not you should try this amazing place.

Right next to my favorite Dutch Bros so I wanted to give this place a shot. I got 4 tacos because people said they were really small and they were actually. I was still hungry after 4 and I'm an average sized male. Kinda felt sad because that was like 15$ right there. So I didn't wanna get more. The tacos are amazing the pricing is a little high for the small size. Still a good place to eat at.

Right when I entered this place I was in shock. The place is just beautiful I fell in love with the colors they have the bar inside with the drinks coming out of the wall. It was just a perfect sized small restaurant that's family owned.i walked in and a girl took me to a table. I had multiple waiters I don't even know who got my tip. Haha every time one waiter would come to another table he would also go to others to check on people. I even had the girl upfront come ask me how everything was and she went and got me a refill I don't even think she's suppose to do that. I ordered Citrus chicken and the calamari appetizer. The Citrus chicken was okay I saw it on Yelp someone suggested it but it's nothing to WOW about but I liked the way it tasted. The Calamari appetizer was just incredible. I was in shock it was huge easily can be shared with one more person. All of it was tasty and the food came out hot and fast. The owner I wanna say also came up to me and asked if everything is okay. I love the family feel I know everything has to be perfect. She was talking to every customers and I can tell she has regulars because of how long she was talking to them and how she greeted some of them. This place is just amazing. Can't wait to try some more things here. Good place to take family or friends or get some carry out!

Great staff and great food. Pizza or salad! Love the beer and wine also great with a nice pizza. You have so many choices and they have choices for you. The staff is nice and talkative which I like a lot. Wish they put the menu in the front where the toppings are and not right when you enter. Because when you get to the front you already forgot what toppings. Also with the beer and wine they should have TVs would love enjoying a beer and watching some sports or news. Place is nice.

Never seen something so useless in my life. A bunch of small stores with no good things. Smells weird and there isn't even a lot of stores to be honest. Everyone looks like they don't wanna be there which sucks. Place isn't good at all. Don't waste your Money on junk.

I had the best experience at this place. I was at my scottsdale home and saw this pop up on Yelp and I love sushi just scared of trying new places. I took 10 of my friends that were in town and we spent about 200$ here It amazing and the workers were funny and having fun serving us cracking jokes and stuff. The sushi was good the seating was good and it was fast. Literally we were in and out with no hassle. Just a great job. I don't get why their is bad reviews for family owned places. Show this place some support and go in and try their sushi! Wish I could give them more than just 5 stars lol.

Probably the worst garlic cheesy bread... The girl on the phone recommended it. I literally was disgusted when I saw it and I tried it because I don't judge foods off how they look.. But it was gross. The pizza was so oily the cheesy wouldn't even stay on it. It wasn't like a lot of cheese it was barley anything and it came off every time I grabbed a slice. Paid 25$ for nothing. Probably the worst pizza experience I've ever had. Never ordering from them again.

Honestly for this random sushi spot by Harkins its really good. We ordered a lot of sushi of all kinds mostly the ones with the most popular sign next to them. Prices are high for this hidden location and it was pretty good just sucks because some of the workers don't even know English so it's useless to ask them for a fork when they go running to another worker. Place is cool.

Top Golf where you spend a lot of money, that should be a slogan for them. Top Golf is nice it's close to everything you want like talking stick or even old town Scottsdale. This area is a fun and a growing area and you will have fun coming here if you have a good group of people. Friday-Sunday night there will always be wait times sometimes even to an hour which is expectable because it always happens with how buys this place is. If it's your first time you have to get a card that's 5$ but you get to keep it forever. You go to your bay or section and you slide the card into the machine and each player has to do that. It's basically like bowling. After that you select how long you want to play so 30 minutes to an hour to two hours it's on whatever you guys want but obviously more time more money. One hour is 45$ so you have to split that with your group. I've came her a couple of times over the year and the menu changed this last time I was there with new products and taking some things off. I ordered the Bacon and Cheese roll and they were out... The biggest picture on the appetizer page and they didn't have and the girl suggested it. I ordered chips and guacamole and they give you so much chips and barley any Guacamole or salads. Why?? Because they want you to order more obviously more $$$ but if you know good guacamole you won't be ordering more because it's tasteless and lacks flavor. Also my friends ordered the same and mine came out 5 minutes after.. Didn't really make any sense. I also ordered the quesadilla and it was gross they put so much peppers and no cheese at all for the price it truly sucks.. Don't get the peppers in it maybe it will be better. Another mistake they made where my food just came out late but we all ordered the same thing.. Like my friend got the same order and my quesadilla just didn't wanna come. I guess the girl forgot it so I reformed her and she said she'll go check after about 10 minutes I ask her again she replies with "it's only been 7 minutes" what kind of customer service is that??? Shouldn't I get "oh I'm sorry it will be out soon" just give me some BS don't reply with how longs it's been like it hasn't been long at all. Service is just terrible. The food all has no taste and had a big price.. So food sucks and you get a golfing experience but you can't smoke or vape. This place could be 100 times better if they knew what they were doing. It's fun but nothin

New owners changed this place quickly. You'll most likely see a DJ on Friday and Saturday and it's packed with people! The owners are nice and friendly and always make you satisfied. Don't like your hookah they will replace it for you with out saying anything. They are generous and ask people if they need water or anything. Great people great place. The best Hookah spot in the valley! Try it out and you'll never go to another place again! Wide selection of drinks from sodas to teas to energy drinks with snacks and great flavors. This spot can't get any better!!

Honestly place is very clean and very busy all the time from right when they open to right when they close. Sometimes you can tell when the chicken isn't fresh and has been sitting around and also the fries. When it's the best is when it's so hot you can't even bite into it without burning your mouth other times you can tell it's been sitting out and just cold. The bread is my favorite part of the meal you can exchange a couple things depends on what you order I exchange the slaw for an extra piece of bread. The iced tea is also another thing to try so sweet so good! The freshness needs to be fixed also add some ranch? Or more sauces for the dish. They have this special sauce that is good but ranch or some bbq sauce would be good at times also. Customer service is okay not something I can really talk about. Place is cool way better than KFC.

One of my friends told me to try this place out for carpet cleaning. It ended up being the best choice I have ever taken in my life. My carpet was spot on clean it looked so much more better it honestly looked like I just bought it but my carpet is 8 years old. The service was cheap and amazing. Can't wait till I call them again.

I gave this place two tries before giving my honest opinion. The place is hidden inside the little shopping center on 59th. You get seated quickly on the two times I went I didn't get a waiting time and it wasn't that packed. They bring our water right away even if you don't ask for it which is really good. I didn't really have like one waiter because multiple waiters will come by and ask you how everything is doing and if you need anything which is really good. I order the STROZZAPRETI ALLA SALSICCIA (pasta) the first time I was there with the Forno bread which was only 2$. The pasta was amazing just not a big size so I had to eat a lot of bread with it to be stuffed the Forno bread comes with olives but with seeds. I would really wish they were seedless because the olives are small and hard to eat and also don't want to pick seeds out of my mouth at a restaurant. The second time I had the PIZZA CHEF pizza which was also very delicious. This pizza had nothing wrong with it. Both those entrees were delicious. The coffee I had at the end was not good at all I put 4 packs of sugar and it still tasted sugarless. The tables are also small if you only have one or two people, couldn't really fit the entrees we had on the table we had to move things around. For a pizza and pasta spot this place is good and feels fresh and tasty. The prices are a little hefty being the small pasta was 16$ and is not enough to fill you up if you don't have bread. Make the portion bigger or lower the prices and this could be a five star joint.

I had the greatest time at a house I rented for a weekend for a couple of my friends from out of the town. The set up was just amazing. They provided us with everything. The house was stand out beautiful and it was so simple and easy I loved it. Can't wait to do it again! The process was very easy I had a slight difficulty over just a browser issue that got resolved in 5 minutes. I call customer service and they did it all for me. I loved how amazing it was. Very good company that will give you the weekend you need. Best place to go instead of a hotel and just relax! I had a really good stay and I hope everyone else will too! 5 out of 5 is a must. Don't pass up on chances with Arizona Vacation rentals you will regret it at the end.

I came here because I don't like wing stop and I love wings. Buffalo Wild Wings is cool but nothing to go crazy for. So when I saw this place on Yelp I got excited because it's right by my house and anywhere I really go. Saw that the TWC and Sriracha honey wings were recommended so I got those and honestly they were good but nothing to go nuts for. The place was clean and the Kool-Aid option is cool. You get a "free" drink when you get fries with the wings but realistically it's like making it a meal so truly it's not free because 2$+ for a small side of fries is expensive especially adding a drink to it. The ranch is not thick and has dill in it. That's what I'm guessing. Wings were cool, customer service was cool and the place was clean. I recommend over wing stop and Buffalo Wild Wings.

Saw this place on my feed "Hot and New" so why not give this place a try. Good reviews for the start, walked in and noticed it was very clean. Got greeted like I was a legend a loud "hi how are you today" and everything he said was ending with a sir. I got the hot dog because he recommended it and a half Philly cheese steak, 6 honey BBQ wings and a drink about 17$. Which is responsible and I didn't care I wanted to try everything. Food was brought out for us and everything was amazing. The Philly was cheesy and the sauce was dripping out. The wings were crispy and just amazing. And the hot dog was incredible. I can say this place got my attention and I'll be back trying out everything else on the menu. It's clean, fast, hot, and just amazingly good.

I've been waiting for this place to open for a while now. Right when I walked in I was in shock of how nice this place looks. Everything is well organized and spotless. I got a hello by all the workers which makes me feel like this place is live. All the waitresses are women which I can not complain about. I got 10 chipotle honey glazed wings and wow did they have so much taste and the chicken wing is filled with meat and its juicy it's not wings from Buffalo Wild Wings these are actually quality. I also ordered a side of fried pickles and they were fried to perfection and the dipping sauce on the side was amazing. The owners are talkative and want the best for you, going around and asking you how it is and always coming back to see if you need anything. The bar area is beautiful and you can also sit outside and be on the bar. TVs are everywhere and the music is amazing. This place is great I can't wait to be back on a game night and drink and have some amazing food with amazing service.

This place is just fantastic!! The inside of this place is great it sets a very good relaxing mood.. Would be a great place for some wine and a date to be honest. Imad the owner is just wonderful and full of joy he will not let you leave unsatisfied!! Came and brought free shots for my guest for the welcoming of his new place. The outside seating is amazing!!! On the second floor and a great view!! The hookah is great and the food menu is nice and simple!! Let this Arizona heat leave and the good weather kick in this is a must stop if you're in old town for a pre game or just a relaxing night with friends!! I suggest going here and showing some love to the new owner!! Meet the owner and get to know him always positive energy is given when you're around him the other employees are nice as well some need some energy to make you feel like home but imad does that for you!! Can't wait for the future of this place!
