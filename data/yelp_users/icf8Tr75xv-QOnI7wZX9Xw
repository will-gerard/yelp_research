We took our in-laws here while they were visiting from out of state. This was on their to do list of local experiences. It was also my first time here since moving to the valley. Nobody was disappointed.    We came for lunch on a Thursday around noon. We were able to get metered parking right in front of the place. There is a lot in back that charges $5.00 as well.They were about 30% full. We were seated right away and greeted by our waitress immediately. They brought a highchair for the baby too.    I loved the décor. Classic rock and roll memorabilia was the theme. Many of Alice Cooper's own items decorated the wall from tour posters to guitars. There were several large screen TVs and classic rock and roll music was playing as well. The waitresses were dresses in attire that also supported the theme.    The menu feature's items with a celebrity theme. I ordered the "Adam Richman's bases loaded big unit" and a local micro brew. The food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time. This was a 1 lb., 22" loaded hotdog with a good order of fries. The hot dog was an all beef hotdog on a bun loaded with sauerkraut, "nightmare" chili, onions, tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, and shredded cheddar cheese. It was more than I could hope to eat, but I did do serious damage. After I got a to go box, we browsed the gift shop. Everything Alice was available.   This place isn't for everybody who is not into the genre. We did enjoy it and will return on special occasions. If you go make it a week day for lunch. It's probably when you'll get best for service. They are located near Chase Field, so they are probably packed on game day. The menu is a little pricy, but worth the experience.

I like this store. Similar to all the others. You get points on your Fry's card which translates into savings at the gas pump. Right now this is the closest on to my residence, so when I checked in Yelp wanted my review. I have a review for another location as well.

First time here, definitely not the last. The restaurant is in a strip mall with an alfresco option. The décor is appropriately oriental with soft music in the background to add to the ambiance.      We came here for lunch on a Wednesday shortly after they opened. We were seated immediately and greeted by our waitress in a minute or two. I had the sushi lunch special which included 3 sushi rolls, a salad, and miso soup for just under $10.00.     The spicy tuna roll was good. It could have been a little more spicy for my taste. The California roll and the salmon roll were very good. The miso soup was average. The most impressive part of the meal was the amount of sushi I got for about $10.00. I'm adding this restaurant to my list as the best sushi lunch deal.

Same meal, same deal. I was just as impressed with the sushi here as I was the first time. I took my daughter here and she was impressed. She's from a coastal city and  is not easily impressed with sushi here in the valley.

You need to be a David to slay this Giant. This place has been reviewed by the Arizona Republic and has won the best burger award in Mesa 2015. It certainly makes my best burger list. This "Giant Burger" is fresh ground beef, not a pre-made frozen patty. It has to be at least 1/3 pound to start with. They use large buns to accommodate this monster with all the toppings.  I ordered the cheese burger. I substituted the regular cheese for Swiss cheese. I added bacon and mushrooms. There are several more add-ons I could have chosen from. Add-ons are an extra charge. This all comes with tomato, lettuce, onions, mustard, and mayo. When I got the burger, It was over 3" high. It looked like one of those burgers they show on TV. You know, the kind that looks like a real hand full but when you get one your 3 year old could handle it. This was not the case. I had to struggle to get my hands around it without loosing any or completely squashing it.  The burger was cooked perfectly. The other toppings added to the perfection. I would have wanted a little more mustard and should have ordered catsup. (Catsup is on the side and has to be requested) I seriously wanted a piece of pie afterward, as they have a variety of fresh baked pies, but after eating half a cow I was stuffed. They also serve breakfast as well which may be worth trying. I can only imagine what their Giant Omelet is like.   A couple things worth noting. They charge 60 cents for using plastic to pay with. The restroom is a uni-sex bathroom behind the grill and through the dish room.

We had been going to Simpleton's for a few years, specifically for karaoke. The karaoke hosts are super. The food isn't too bad for bar food. The pork tenderloin is the best they offer. That's where it goes down hill. The wait staff there favors the larger groups. They walk by the tables several times without stopping to take orders from tables with 5 or more people. the last time we went there was the last time we will be back. They got our checks mixed up at the register and it caused our friend to overdraw. No apology and it took over a week to fix the error. If you do go, sit at a table with a lot of people and pay in cash.

This review is mainly about the limited time offer "Angriest Whopper". I don't usually rate fast food chains, but in this case I will rate the product.  This store is like any other. It's close to home so this is where I came to try the newest addition to the menu. I don't usually like Burger King, but the "Angriest Whopper" is very good. The bun is a bright red. (a lot of food coloring I imagine). It has a slight burn to it as it has hot sauce baked in and is topped with sesame seeds. The burger is a probably frozen quarter pound patty grilled through. This is topped with crispy bacon, Generous amounts of lettuce and tomato, Jalapeño peppers, onion rings, and cheese. They put mayo on of course unless you ask not to.  This burger is so far my favorite one they have ever offered. It was juicy, spicy, and tasty. The fries were over salted as is the case at most fast food joints. I might get another chance to get one of these burgers before the promotion ends.

We came here looking for a bedroom set. The store was advertising a store closing sale. We snagged a 5 piece queen set for $600.00. This is a great bargain. The sales associate, (Red) was very helpful and accommodating. She answered all our questions.

This is the second time we have rented here. The first time was 7 years ago. After moving away we were pleased to find Kristy was still there and now is the manager.  This is a gated community. The apartment buildings consist of 4 lowers and 4 uppers. One of the best aspects of this complex is the landscape. They do their best to make this place feel like home. We were pleased to find some of the same tenants living there that we knew from 7 years ago.  As with any public housing complex the experience depends on the other tenants living there. Our previous experience was good. We did have a problem with another tenant as did several other people living in the complex. The management took care of the problem. That tenant no longer lives there. Kristi doesn't put up with bull####. As long as you pay rent on time and follow the rules stated in the lease, you won't have problems.  The Maintenance crew worked hard to make sure our apartment was ready for us to move in on the date it was promised. We are looking forward to living here again.

They have a going out of business sale. Maybe all the 1 and 2 star reviews had something to do with it. We came here looking for a dining room set. We found a nice table with 4 chairs. The original price was $699,00. The manager let us have it for $399.00. that's what we would have spent on the chairs alone. The sales rep was friendly and informative. I felt we got a good deal. They do advertise that all sales are final and no refunds. the tag on the table was marked "sold as is".

This is my go to store for home improvement. Since we bought our house a year and a half ago, we have gotten everything from paint to landscaping. The prices are reasonable and the sales people are very helpful. We had a cabinet designer spend 3 hours working on a kitchen remodel. Didn't cost us a thing. Ikea wanted $200.00 for the same service.    I will continue to use Lowe's for all my home improvement needs. They stand behind their merchandise.

This place just doesn't trip my trigger. The price is about average for a lunch buffet, but the selection is not. It is laid out all wrong.They have the plates at the end of the salad bar which is walled in to allow a line of people to walk on either side. When going for another plate, you have to squeeze past the people getting salad to get another plate. Then unless you get another salad, you have to squeeze past them again to go to the other buffet tables. Easy remedy would to have a plate holder at each station, or remove the wall. The dessert table is at the end of the salad bar and ahead of the soup table. The nachos and cheese are at the very end, but you have to go back wards to get the taco meat and salsa. If you want black olives, jalapeno peppers, or onions, you have to squeeze past all those people in line at the salad bar because that's where these items are located. To top it off, the Ice cream machine was broken.  Now about the quality. I liked one of the 4 soups they offered. The twice baked potato soup was pretty good. Now I know what they do with all of yesterday's baked potatoes. The Italian wedding soup, not very good, and I'm part Italian I would know. The pizza is one of the worst pizzas I've had. It's like they put toppings and tomato sauce on a flour tortilla and baked it a few minutes. The crust was limp and doughy. the sauce was very bland, and the toppings barely cooked. The macaroni and cheese was like wallpaper paste. The noodles over cooked the cheese sticky and gooey. It tasted ok, I didn't care for the texture. The baked sweet potato was mush in a skin. There's no other way to describe it. Again a texture thing. The only redeeming quality I found was the salad bar, and as I've stated it's set up wrong. The salad and toppings were fresh, There were several dressings to choose from.  As far al lunch buffets go, I'd rather spend just a little more and go elsewhere.

I have been a loyal customer of Midas for years. Scotty (the manager) is number one when it comes to customer service. The mechanics there identify problems and show you before working on your vehicle. I love the fact that most of the parts they use come with a lifetime warrantee. I recommend this Midas auto service to my closest friends. That's how much I value this place.

I don't understand the reviews stating only one check out line open. There is a sign claiming a 3 person guarantee. More than 3 people, they open another check out. Maybe this is a direct result of past reviews, but I've seen it in action. That being said, I go to this store because it's right down the road from me. I use the Safeway card, in store specials, flyer coupons, and the 10% senior discount on Wednesday to save a bundle. Last trip I saved 48%. I got fuel points toward a discount at the pump also. This is not where I do most of my shopping, but I do watch the flyers and snatch up the deals here.

I brought a friend here because we had time to kill while his sister was shopping. We each ordered sandwiches off the menu. It doesn't take an Einstein to figure out that they have more than just bagels. So I wanted to review this place based on their sandwiches. My friend ordered a ham and Swiss which he shared with me. I ordered the Nova lox bagel. The Ham and Swiss was made with Ham, Swiss cheese, red onion, lettuce, tomato, Mayo, and mustard, on potato bread. My sandwich was a typical lox and bagel. Perfectly smoked salmon on a plain bagel with capers and cream cheese.  Both sandwiches were delicious. The counter staff was helpful and polite, contrary to other reviews. The coffee was fresh and very good. They offer a couple different varieties and all the condiments It comes out of a self serve pump canteen. Usually those are Luke warm at best. These were piping hot. We watched the steam roll off the cup while we enjoyed our bagel sandwich. I saw a wide variety of bagels in the display case. They will have to wait for another visit as the sandwich filled me up.

I bought tires at Discount Tire a couple years go. Their service and quality are the best. Today I brought my car to this particular store just before they opened for a nail in my tire. The dealer wouldn't repair it. We were waiting for he doors to open and were greeted in the parking lot by a sales rep. He got us right in. 15 minutes later he told us it was repaired and all other tire pressures were checked as well. What amazed me is they didn't charge a thing. I guess customer service is alive and well at this store. I will continue to bring my vehicle back for service.

This is my Shell of choice. They give a 10 cent a gallon  discount when you use your shell credit card. They give an additional 10 cent a gallon discount when you use your Fry's fuel points. 20 cents a gallon adds up after a while. I also just used their FREE vacuums and newly renovated car wash. If anyone complained about the car wash malfunctioning before, I suggest checking it out now. Yes I'm a fan and loyal customer. I have always had a good experience here.

Came here on a Wednesday for the karaoke. The place has changed a lot since I was here several years ago. I like the improvements. It doesn't feel like the hick bar I experienced years earlier. It is more trendy now. The crowd was a mix of younger and older people. The younger ones were mostly in back by the pool tables. I guess the old timers like their karaoke which was set up on the dance floor just as you walk in.  The bartender was very attentive. The drinks were average in price. They have a popcorn machine which is self serve. If you are willing to some I'd suggest getting to it right after it is made. It is right near the restrooms and I saw someone come out and go right to the popcorn. After thinking about it I didn't want anymore.  I'll be back if only for the karaoke.

We go to this store because it's close to our house. The place is clean. They just got new tables and chairs. We love the breakfast burritos they offer. The lunch and dinner items are very good as well. The price is reasonable. They are open 24 hours. My first choice for a quick breakfast.

I like Applebee's. It's my wife's favorite restaurant. I go for we go there. You get two entrees and an appetizer to split. Tonight we got the 2 for 20. Mine was the quesadilla burger, hers was the chicken tenders. The order came with French fries. Our appetizer was the spinach artichoke dip with nacho chips. As always the dip was good. Creamy and smooth, almost want to just eat it with a spoon good. I ordered the quesadilla burger which was my first time ordering this. This is a hamburger wrapped in a quesadilla made with Monterey Jack cheese. The burger was cooked perfectly to my specifications. It was sandwiched in a quesadilla composed of melted cheese, Pico de Gallo. and grilled flour tortilla. It was a good burger. The only thing that would have made it a 5 star burger would have been chipotle or taco seasoning on the burger. As it was it was a little bland. I got some Tabasco to spice it up a little. The fries were crispy not soggy. I hate soggy.  The service was excellent. It was a full house tonight and Samantha was right there servicing out table as if we were the only ones there. The restrooms were clean and well maintained. This one is a keeper in my book giving it a 4 star rating.

I have used this location several times before they always help me rent exactly the trailer I need. They sell boxes and packing there as well as tape. This is a complete package when it comes to moving. I was impressed this last time when I needed to rent an appliance dolly. The daily rate for one is $10.00. When I asked to rent one for the day, the guy brought one out and told me, "Just being it back". Wow! Who does that? Apparently they did for me. Maybe he recognized me from other times I've been there. I wouldn't expect that again, but the fact that I got the appliance dolly on loan knocked my socks off. This makes my list of "outstanding customer service".

We are staying here for a month until our apartment comes available. I was impressed with the customer service here. We had a site reserved for a month, but the apartment notified us we had to wait another week. When we asked for another week they were ok with that. They have activities and social clubs here. There is a nice café in the clubhouse. They helped us hook up our RV. The park is well maintained and clean. There is free cable and WiFi. It is difficult to find your way around as the streets are not well marked. This is a nice place to stay. I'm glad we found it.

I came to this Bed Bath and Beyond because they had the athletic stretch bands I was looking for. The Google search brought me to the BB&B website. They had a package of 3 online for $7.49. when I got to the store they were priced $14.49. After mentioning that they were advertised on their website for &7.49, they promptly gave me that price and apologized for the error. The cashier mentioned that she would be changing the price on the remaining stock to reflect the sale price. This is an example of good customer service. I was impressed with the variety of items for sale here. It's worth a trip back to check out everything else they have here.

This is our store of choice. We use the electronic coupons we can load on to our VIP card. They automatically apply when we use the card. The store is well organized and clean. The check outs are never backed up. The one we shop at has fresh sushi. The prices are good and the VIP card lets us save 10 cents a gallon on gas.

The place is a dive. We came out because of the entertainment. We heard they do karaoke which was pretty good. This guy had every song ever made. That was the best part of the experience.      The décor was American Hodgepodge. Nothing really seemed to go together. The chairs had a white or off white finish I couldn't tell which because they were dirty. One had dried mustard or melted cheese all over the back of it. The one bartender was nice and attentive. I do think she should refrain from singing karaoke while serving customers. It's kind of rude.    Here's the real reason we won't be back. We arrived at 8:45. We ordered food and was told the kitchen closes at 9:00 and couldn't get anything on the menu. What kind of place has entertainment and closes the kitchen? I was looking forward to trying the El Dorado burger, a 1/3 pound cheeseburger topped with a pile of pastrami. My suggestion if you go for the entertainment, is eat first or get there early.

This is one of my favorite stores. I'm half Italian and come here for authentic Italian ingredients. The deli is filled with pasta dishes, antipasto, and Italian meats. There is a variety of homemade pasts in the freezer. They carry imported olive oil, cheeses, and sauces. I can find everything I need to cook a traditional Italian meal just like mama used to. There are several wines to choose from to enrich the Italian dining experience. To quote The Godfather, "leave the gun, take the cannoli". The cannoli here is the best I've had in a very long time.  Today I picked up a bottle of garlic oil and some pasta flour. Tony was working today and we spent time talking about lasagna. He makes the lasagna here. In his enthusiasm I think he let a few family secrets slip to me, but don't worry Tony, mums the word. I can not come to Scottsdale without a trip to Defalco's.

We catch at least 2 D-backs games a year. This is a great place for a baseball game in the valley. The roof is closed when the weather gets hot and the temp is a cool 77 degrees inside for the game. There are lots of food and team shops on the concourses.     Parking is conveniently located across the street. There is a skyway that crosses over and leads to the upper level entrance. I will continue to look forward to seeing games here.

I love this theatre. They have 25 screens. they show multiple screens with movies that are popular so there are always seats available. I am a loyalty member. what this means is I own a cup and a tee shirt that I bought there. This gives me a free medium popcorn and a $1.50 drink + 1 free refill every time I go to a movie. The theater rooms are cleaned between each showing. The sound and picture are as good as it gets.

We went here on a Saturday morning. We heard about this store from an advertisement on the news. When we got there, it was insanely busy. The store is well organized with the racks well labeled with sizes, and different types of clothes. The aisles are tight, and the customers bump into each other constantly.  Their inventory is mostly high end/designer. This is a women's store only. There are no selections of stuff for men. They have purses, shoes, clothes and accessories.  My wife opted not to try stuff on, because the fitting rooms which are located in the back corner of the store, the line for the fitting rooms reached to the main entrance, with women that had carts overflowing with clothes waiting to try on. She took the chance, and purchased her items to try on at home. They have a no refund/exchange policy, so make sure you pick your accurate size, or wait an obscenely long time for the fitting rooms.  My wife said she will go back to the store, but it will not be a regular stop on her thrift store shopping trips.

This is the most efficient way to travel the valley. The light rail runs from Mesa drive and Main street in Mesa to 19th avenue and Dunlop in Glendale. The route cuts through downtown Phoenix connects with many bus routes and the Sky Harbor Sky train. An all day pass is only $4.00. and is good on the buses as well. I use the light rail when traveling to the airport or to Chase field downtown. There are park and ride lots in several locations along the light rail route. You can park for free while riding the light rail. When you factor in parking, gas, and fighting rush hour traffic, the light rail makes sense when traveling around the valley. You will meet a lot of interesting people along the way.

This is a nice little restaurant, little being the operative word here. We arrived to a line of people out the door. Obviously a local favorite on a Sunday morning. The lady ahead of me said they have been coming here every Sunday morning for years. This place really knows how to deal with a breakfast crowd on a busy day. As soon as the line went out the door, they set up chairs outside to sit on. This was short lived as the rush of people were soon seated. These people staff according to peak business times. We were seated in about 6 minutes.   Our waitress was Mandy. She was right there to greet us with menus and to take our drink order. I ordered the breakfast burrito. While waiting for the order, I took time to admire all the antique country items that adorned the walls. Given the amount of people at the time, our orders were up reasonably quick. We were eating within 25 minutes of being seated. My burrito was one of the best breakfast burrito's I've had. It was made with fried potatoes, scrambled eggs, sausage, and topped with cheese and salsa. It was very filling. The price is reasonable.  One thing to keep in mind. If you show up in a group, wait until everyone is present to be seated. They don't hold tables for a party.

This branch is closest to my house. It's nice when a neighborhood bank treats you like a neighbor. I have always had good customer service here. When I needed to have something notarized, I was able to see a notary without waiting. There was no charge.

7 Miles down a washboard gravel road just outside of Gold Canyon AZ, lies a trailhead known as the Peralta Trail. People come here in droves to hike this trail This hike has it all. There are steep challenging parts and mostly flat, catch your breath parts. About a 5 mile round trip, this hike is  filled with beautiful desert landscape and rugged mountain views. The climax is at the top, well known as "The Saddle". Here you get a prime view of Weaver's Needle. Legend has it, The Lost Dutchman mine is within eye shot of this peak. Any way the view alone is worth the trek. We hike it several times a year. Here are some tips. We have hiked this trail early in the morning. The pro is that it's cool when you start out. The con is that you are in the sun the whole hike, and by the end it gets pretty toasty on a late spring day. We have hiked it late in the afternoon. That time of day is the hottest part of the day. You spend the first half of the hike on a steep incline in the sun. The benefit of doing this is that the second half of the hike is nearly all shaded as the south ridge blocks the afternoon sun. Even sweeter is on the return trip, It's down hill and the whole trail is shaded by the late in the afternoon. This is a popular hike, so you will have to share the trail with many other hikers. This is one of my favorite hikes. There will be as many return trips as this old body can do.

I was invited to lunch with friends. They were buying so... I'm glad they chose this place. It's a small restaurant behind an animal hospital. They are authentic Mexican. I ordered the burrito Grande. The burrito was loaded with shredded beef and cheese, smothered in a green chili sauce. it came with a side of refried beans topped with cheese, fried rice, and lettuce, not to mention a large bowl of nacho chips and sauce.  The burrito and sides were delicious. I already know what I'm ordering next time. As I was eating, the waitress brought out a steaming, and I mean steaming hot plate of fajita. The mouth watering smell permeated the restaurant. My mouth enjoyed the burrito but my mind was anticipating the fajita. It won't be long before you see an updated review paying homage to their fajita.

I've been here a few times for breakfast. I usually get the breakfast burrito which is my favorite. This morning I ordered the traditional breakfast with scrambled eggs and ham. the order came with a side of toast and fried potatoes. The food here is always good and I have never been disappointed in the service. This is one of my favorite breakfast stops in Mesa.

I love this place. It has all the ambiance of the Parthenon. There is Greek music in the background. Someone bring out a flaming dish and everybody hollers "Opah". The Gyros are some of the best that I have had anywhere. Try the humus. You won't be disappointed.

We stopped in here because of the Yelp reviews. Yelp was right. This place is great. They sell pizza by the slice and whole pizzas. We bought a slice, well maybe two. You order then sit down and you order is brought out to you. While we were waiting for our pizza I noticed that Guy Fieri was here and did a show on Drive-ins, Diners, and Dives. How cool is that? Our pizza arrived in minutes and OMG! It was worth every cent. I got a baked ziti slice and a supreme slice. These were HUGE slices. When they arrived I wondered if I had over ordered. I wasn't sure I could finish them. Both slices were perfectly cooked. The crust was a thin and crispy, my favorite. There was adequate sauce and a moderate amount of cheese, but hey it's about the toppings right? They crammed as many toppings on those slices as possible. There is much more on the menu. I am for sure going to return and work my way through the menu on many more visits.

Great little meat market. They sell the best cuts of meat as well as homemade sausages. They have dog treats made from smoked and dried beef and pork.  We picked up some bratwurst and natural hotdogs and wieners for the grill. I love the jalapeño cheddar cheese brats. we got a pig ear for our dog. She devowered it. The ones we got from other stores she would just carry around then burry. They have so much good stuff here we are excited to try more. You pay a little more for things here, but the quality is worth it.

We came here for lunch after church Sunday. The place is in a strip mall. You are transported to another time and place when you walk through the door. The décor is antique Irish for the most pare except for the subtle tribute to the Seattle Seahawks. The even have a small library filled with old books. The tables and chairs are a rustic looking and wooden. The floors are also wooden. When we walked in the background music was contemporary rock. It was as out of place as a swimsuit in the Sahara Desert. When the waitress took our drink order I asked, "What's up with the music? I was expecting Irish music with the effort put forth toward Irish ambiance". She changed it to old Irish folk music. The restroom looked clean but in need of repair as paint was peeling and some of the ceiling  tiles had gotten wet sometime and were falling down.  They have drink specials and dishes reflective of an Irish theme. I contemplated the corned beef and cabbage, but went with the fish and chips at my daughter's recommendation. This was an excellent choice. I got 2giant pieces of deep fried crispy battered cod and what seemed like a half pound of thin crispy fries. This is the best fish I've tasted in a very long time. I was even more pleased to find that Fridays is all you can eat. This is a little redundant as I couldn't have eaten more than two anyway.  The rating breakdown is as follows: Service- 4 Food- 5 Ambiance- 4 Restroom-2 Price- moderate  Total experience- 4

I came back here for a friend's birthday. Our server was Alex. He was very informative . My friend had some dietary restrictions. He went over options that would work with her restrictions. He also made sure the kitchen staff was aware of the restrictions as well. This is great customer service. I started off with pulled pork sliders for an appetizer. I shared them with my wife. They were tender, smoky, and juicy. This was a good indicator of the pulled pork sandwich they offer. For the entrée  I decided to try the Belfast burger. This was one of the best burgers I've had. It is a 1/2 pound burger on a brioche bun topped with lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, roasted red pepper, mushrooms, garlic sauce, an onion ring, and your choice of cheese.(I chose pepper jack) The burger was grilled to a medium well which was my specification. The burger was full of flavor, juicy, and very filling. Almost makes me wish I had not ordered the sliders. I couldn't finish the fries that came with the burger. I also had two Guinness nitro IPA beers. They had happy hour so all appetizers and tap beer was 50%off. I was asked about dessert, but there was no room left. I will be back here later this month for a graduation party.

This is a great nature preserve and park. Over 100 miles of hiking, biking, and horseback riding trails. One of the most famous trails is the Wind Cave trail. It has a moderate difficulty with a mile and a half steady climb. At the top there is a cave carved out of the limestone by the wind, hence the name. From here you can look out over the east valley. On a good day you can see all the way into Phoenix. I like the less traveled Pass Mountain trail. This is a seven mile hike around the base of Pass Mountain. It is an easy relatively even terrain with a couple short climbs. The lower trails are short loops nicely groomed for biking and horseback riding. These trails get a lot of multi use activity. Riders, mountain bikers, and hikers generally yield to one another. My only complaint comes after I've stepped in horse droppings.  There is a nature center as you enter the park. Inside you will find maps, hiking guides, plant and animal identification charts, plenty of souvenirs, and the nicest rangers around. They do activities geared toward kids and family. We watched them feed the snakes one night, and watched a movie about the desert on another. They offer a full moon hike once a month. The hike follows a 2 mile loop usually guided by Ranger B. He will talk about native plants and animals, about the history of the park, and answer all your questions about the park. The city lights are captivating on this hike. They say to bring a flashlight but the moon is bright enough you only need one on overcast nights.  The park admission is $6.00 or $75.00 for an annual pass. There is a campground and an archery range on part of the park, but I'm not sure what the fee is for those. This is my favorite park in Arizona.

First of all any place that gives check in freebees when you check in on Yelp is ok in my book. We each got a free soft drink when we checked in. We came here for lunch on a Saturday. The place was not too busy. The first thing I noticed even before we were through the door was the smoky barbeque smell. I'm sure many people have walked in salivating with anticipation. We were seated in a booth immediately. Our waiter was actually the catering manager. He spent a few minutes telling us about the place and gave us a little history about Waldo's.   After a few minutes I decided to order the brisket sandwich with a side order of beans. Bye the way, all the sides are unlimited so you can literally make a pig of yourself. Our food was out in a reasonable amount of time. Our order came with a nice piece of fresh baked corn bread, which was very good. It also came with a mini-skillet full of homemade barbeque sauce. This sauce is out of this world good. I was tempted to take the straw from my drink and drink the sauce. The brisket was tender and smoky. By itself it was pretty ordinary, but the sauce made my sandwich juicy and savory. The beans were good also. I spooned some barbeque sauce in those as well.  The restaurant itself is showing signs of age. The ceiling is cracked, and the outside could use a new coat of paint. I think it works well if they are trying for a roadhouse ambiance. I am not a big fan of wood chips or peanut shells on the floor. The walls are adorned with funny little signs and sayings. The ceiling is painted sky blue with white clouds painted on it. They have painted pigs in airplanes in such a way as the ceiling fans look like the propellers. I thought it was cute, "when pigs fly".  This is a place we'll come back to for sure. I just don't know what took us so long to stop in here before this. We got a take out menu and a catering menu which is something to consider for a party.

We came here for good pizza. What we got was comparable to Domino's or Pizza Hut. The price was more than I would like to pay for this quality of pizza. The ambience and service was average. If this were the only pizza joint within 20 miles I would return. Since there are better quality places around, probably not.

I stopped in here as I was driving by and saw the sign "Pizza by the slice." It was lunchtime and pizza sounded good. As I walked in I was greeted by Tony Casanova, one of the owners. He asked my name and if this was my first time here. I told him my name is Gene and it was my first time here. He hollered to the back, "Hey Mike, This is Gene and this is his first time here". He shook my hand and said "Welcome. How can I get for you". The reason for this little narrative is to highlight the hospitality afforded this establishment. I ordered a slice of the Sicilian pizza with sausage. It was ready within 5 minutes.   Tony also threw in an order of garlic knots and dipping sauce just because this was my first time here. I don't remember when the last time I walked into a restaurant and was met with this kind of customer service. The pizza slice was quite large, probably 1/8 of a 18" extra large pizza. The pizza and garlic knots were good. I am interested in returning for a dine-in experience soon.

We needed a storage shed for a few weeks. we came here and rented one right on the spot. They have all different  sizes at a reasonable rate. The manager was helpful and friendly. He told us about the rental policy and offered to personally show us the space. FYI: they also store RVs.

I came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning with my wife. While the parking lot looked quite full, the restaurant was not. The only down fall came when we got inside. There was only one attendant taking drink orders and running the register. They charge extra for drinks so someone needs to take that order. They give you the appropriate cup or glass on a tray. When the same person does this and runs the cash register you get a backed up line. They could have just charged for the drink and let people take the appropriate cup or glass there at the register.   I was impressed at the selection of buffet items. Obviously I couldn't try them all. My top picks were Biscuits and gravy, hash brown casserole, the grilled Polish sausage. and the chocolate fountain. I didn't have room enough to try the fried chicken or the omelets they make to your order.  The biscuits were fresh and buttery. The gravy was thick, flavorful and loaded with sausage. This was one of the best biscuits and gravy I have had. I could make an entire meal of them. The hash brown casserole was very tasty. A nice combination of potato cheese and onion. They have a grilled Polish sausage or kielbasa that is smoky salty and juicy. This is a sausage cut lengthwise then grilled. There are real grill marks on the thing. The chocolate fountain was the perfect finish to the enormous meal. I dipped a Rice Krispy treat in the fountain. Yhere is a variety of fruit and other treats to dip.  Some of the less notable items were the sausage links. they had a funky taste. The corned beef hash tasted like it came from a can. The ham was a little salty, the bacon was tough and rubbery.   As I said, the selection was good and what I tried was either very good or average. I will add this place to my favorite buffets list for now. I will see what the lunch and dinner experiences bring.

The food is very good. They make the sushi right in front of you. The prices are reasonable. I like the stir fry grill. You pick out a plate of items from the buffet table and they stir fry them for you. It's like having your own personal stir fry. There is a large selection of food to choose from. This is my favorite Chinese restaurant

We have hiked this trail for years. Located in Usery Park it is a 3.5 total hike with significant climb. Wind Cave is a hollow space worn into the limestone by years of wind erosion. Once at the top of the mountain, you can rest in the hollow and refresh in the shade before your decent. I like this hike as it is a good workout hike. It will let me know how out of shape I've gotten.

We come here for specialty items. They have everything! The prices are the lowest as they advertise. The sales reps answered every question I asked. We sampled some wine at the wine tasting booth, and wound up buying a bottle. I hope they open one near us.

A scenic drive 12 miles east of the valley brought us to Tortilla Flat, an old stagecoach stop with a population of 6 that is now a saloon and general store. This is like stepping into the 1800s with the wood plank walk way and hitching posts to the hand carved wooden Indian that greets you at the entrance of the saloon. I found it odd that the music in the background was 70s & 80s pop but everything else about the décor looked authentic. The walls are papered with dollar bills that patrons have signed and dated over the years.      They have a full bar with the usual mixed drinks and beers as well as a couple local micro-brews. The grub on the other hand is not your typical bar food. They have a western theme and flavor to the dishes they serve up. I have had the "killer chili" served in a bread bowl and topped with shredded cheese. Not too spicy but just enough kick to give it that southwest flavor. Today I ordered the "killer sized burger". It was a 1/2 pound patty covered in chili and topped with cheese and a side of fries. It was all I could eat.     The price was reasonable and the experience worth the drive out. I like to bring visitors from out of town here for lunch and to buy souvenirs. This goes on my list of places to take friends and relatives to when they visit.

We take our dog here often. This is a nice clean dog park. Like ANY other dog park the experience really depends upon the behavior and temperament of the other dogs present at the time. There is a fresh supply of water for the dogs near the entry gate. The park is divided into 2 sections. One for the bigger and more aggressive dogs, the other is for the smaller more timid dogs. We have always had a good experience when we brought our mini Dachshund here. The only complains are the lack of benches, which now we bring camp chairs, and the lack of shade. We started coming in the morning or evening when the sun is low and there is sufficient shade. This is still our dog park of choice.

I usually have a good experience with Office Max, but this time was different. I brought my laptop in because it needed an antivirus update, and I wanted the latest version of windows installed. So I brought it in on a Sunday afternoon. Jeff was the tech we talked to. He ran a scan and said there was some mal-ware on it and it needed a tune up. He told me that to remove the mal-ware, tune it up, and install the software I requested would take 24 hours, 48 at the very most.  My wife needs this laptop for school and her job, so time is of the essence. Monday I called in the evening and they told me the mal-ware was removed, the tune up was done and the antivirus was installed. They were currently installing the latest version of windows and it would be done by the next morning. Tuesday morning I called and was told it was still loading. They called about 3pm to say it was done. My wife went to pick it up and there was no antivirus installed. She was told that it was lost when the latest windows was installed and it had to be reloaded. No idea how long it would be.  By now we were very unhappy as my wife needed to access files for school the next day. Finally about 8pm they called and said it was finished. By the time she got there the techs had gone home so there was no tech support there to talk to about the install. I felt the customer service was lacking. Although apologetic, they should have called to inform us of the delay when the 24 hour time had passed. They should have also checked to make sure everything had installed correctly before calling to say it was finished. As I said I usually have a good experience with Office Max, but this one has opened the possibility of taking it to the Geek Squad at Best Buy next time I need my laptop serviced.

They have prepared our taxes for years. They have worked with complicated dual state returns. They are knowledgeable when it comes to finding tax breaks. We usually can get an appointment a day or two from our initial call. They are a little pricy, but we'll pay it for a complicated return. This year they gave us a break on the cost.

I came here to try some hot wings. When I was here years ago, it was called the Native New Yorker. The place hasn't changed much. We were seated immediately and greeted by our waiter Connor. He was polite and informative about the menu. I ordered the 12 pack with 2 different sauces. I had the honey chipotle which was 3 away from being the hottest, and the ghost pepper wings which were toe top of the scale. The wings were delivered shortly after being ordered. They didn't appear to have much sauce on them. I tried the chipotle honey first. The wing was kind of dry and not spicy at all. My wife who does NOT do spicy could handle it. The ghost pepper wing was also kind of dry. It had a little kick, but so does a dying corpse. Connor asked how the wings were. When I told him they were a little dry and not very spicy, He said that they lightly sauce the extreme flavors. He brought out some additional sauce. This made my wings come alive and not seem so dry. If I had known to order extra sauce this may have made my favorite hot wing list. I will be back. I want to try their burgers, fish and pizza.

I drive to Scottsdale rather than going to going to the Goodwill. This store is small but well organized. They have nice items in good condition. The price is very reasonable. I got a DVD for $3.00. There are many newer items and things that will send you wandering down nostalgia lane with major flashbacks. I found an old shortwave all band radio for $40.00. My parents had one like it when I was a kid, (I'm am old guy now) I left here with a few bargains and will return to treasure hunt another day.

They have a great selection of western wear. The sales person was very helpful. The boots are name brands I'm familiar with so I can tell you the prices are reasonable. If you are into western wear, this place is worth a look.

We stopped in for breakfast. We were the only people in the place at 6:30 am. We were seated immediately of course and our waiter was right there to get our beverage. After a few minutes I decided to order the pork carnitas breakfast burrito. It was on the table in no time at all even though the restaurant began to fill up after I arrived. The burrito was very good. It was made with seasoned shredded pork, diced fried potatoes, green peppers, refried beans, fried onions, and scrambled eggs. All this wrapped in a giant flour tortilla. The burrito came with salsa and sour cream. It was very filling and I left the restaurant without having a piece of their famous pie.

We came for breakfast on a Friday 45 minutes after opening. The buffet is in a casino. You have your choice of valet parking, parking garage or self parking. You have to walk through the casino to get to the buffet, a clever marketing scheme for potential slots addicts. There were only a couple people here at this time so we were seated immediately at a table of our choice. The dining area was separate from the buffet so it had the feel of a formal dining room rather than a cafeteria. They had a wet bar on one end of the dining area near the buffet.    The buffet had a nice selection of pastries, fruit and cereal. The hot dished included several kinds of breakfast potatoes and meats. There were the fixins to make eggs ranchero and many other breakfast standards. They had about 10 different kinds of gelato to finish off the meal. The food was a good quality and tasty. I did however think the O'Brian potatoes were a little greasy. This is a place I will take visitors to for a local experience as it's not a casual dining venue. I want to try the dinner buffet as it sounds fantastic according to the menu, but the $26.00 price sounds a pricy.

I'm a big fan of this place. They have generous portions of tasty barbequed meat, tasty sides, and reasonable prices. We stopped in here Sunday afternoon. This store is located in a large shopping plaza. It wasn't too busy that day. We were seated immediately and greeted by our server who had a trainee with her. The service was prompt.  I ordered the 2 meat lunch combo. the first was the pulled pork the second was the deep fried cod fish. The pork was as good as it always is. I like to jazz it up with Famous Dave's Devil Spit sauce. I have wanted to try the fish for a while. This was a nice filet with a flavorful corn meal coating, deep fried to a crispy crunch. This served with a unique tartar sauce. The sauce had spicy pickle relish in it giving it a bit of a bite.   I got a huge corn muffin and baked beans for a side. I love their corn muffins. They are moist and go well with the barbequed meat. I would have liked butter with it which I didn't get. Needles to say. I had to loosen my belt a bit when I left.

The hallmark of a great café is when you never see the bottom of your coffee cup. It could have been purple here for all I know. Maybe it was because I was so enjoying the food that the coffee level never dipped below half way.      We came here for breakfast mainly because it was reviewed so highly on Yelp. I was not disappointed. The café has an upper Michigan theme, evident from the big banner on the wall with the outline of the upper peninsula and the word "Yooper" on it. I'm from Wisconsin and know a lot of Yoopers there, but haven't met any here. This café is proof they are alive and well here as well.     The service was excellent. We were seated immediately, and our food was on our table in short order. I was surprised as it was a Sunday morning. I ordered the "morning mix up". This was a combination of scrambled eggs, hash browns, ham, green peppers, onions, and cheese baked to perfection. As I said, I'm from Wisconsin, so I know a little about cheese. This was real cheese not the cheap imitation junk some places use. Almost every bite was connected to the next by a long melted string of cheese.     They have pasties on Tuesdays which I'm definitely going to try. The best pasty I ever had was from the UP. Thank you fellow Yelpers for recommending this place so highly. I think I found another favorite go to restaurant at Red Mountain Café.

I came back here for a pasty on Tuesday, as Tuesday is the only day you can get one.. A pasty is a pie crust pastry filled with meat and potatoes and other vegetables. It's like a pot pie in a pastry pocket. I had these as a kid when I lived in northern Wisconsin. This was a traditional staple in the early 1900s for the miners in upper Michigan. The miners would brag about whose wife made the best pasty. I'll bet the ones from this place would have taken the prize.     As always the hostess sat us immediately and the waitress was right there to take our drink order. When I got my pasty It was hot out of the oven. When I cut it open steam rose out of it filling the air with the delicious aroma I had remembered as a kid. It was quite large, but I savored every bite (what I could eat of it)      If you go it is recommended that you call ahead or come in early because they go quickly and they only make just so many for the day. They start serving at 11:00 am until they are gone.

Compared to the MVD on Mesa dr. this one is better. Sure it's crazy busy, but what MVD isn't? I brought a client here who had to use a walker to walk with. We stood in this line of 25+ people just to check in. After about 30 seconds a woman came to us and said she would take us immediately at her window. We came here to get a handicapped tag for their car. There was a problem with the paperwork not being properly filled out. The woman was polite and helpful assisting my client with the necessary corrections. The whole process took about 5 minutes and we had the tag. I was impressed that they show preference to people with disabilities.

I came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning. The weather was beautiful so I sat on the patio. My waitress was Amber AKA "Taste Bud Whisperer". I will start by saying Amber was very personable and swears she will remember my name by what I order. When I return (and I will) I am going to test her. I ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of country potatoes. Amber asked if I wanted half the order with chorizo gravy. I had never tried that so I did. The meal was out in a very short time. I asked for hot sauce for the potatoes. She said we have about 40 different kinds. I was thoroughly impressed. I also found out that they make their own catsup. It was pretty good. The Biscuits were swimming in gravy, ok maybe drowning. I thought the biscuits were a little chewy and kind of small. The country potatoes were nicely done. I wish I had ordered toast or something to take up the excess gravy which was delicious. It seems like a waste to not use all that good gravy.  Well breakfast is a hit. Next time I will do lunch. Maybe I'll get a burger or the Philly steak sandwich.

I stopped in to get a 99 cent corn dog. I also got a frozen yogurt also. While waiting for my corn dog I took time to admire the wall mural. My corn dog was made fresh. It came out steaming hot and perfectly golden. I enjoyed every bite. They don't use cheap hot dogs here. I also got a pineapple frozen yogurt. There are over a dozen flavors to choose from. I had a difficult time deciding which add ins to get. They have a ton to choose from. I selected strawberry topping and carob chips. The pineapple yogurt was refreshing on this warm day. I will be back when I'm in the area and have a hankering for a corn dog. It may have been a 5 star review but the diet coke dispenser was out of syrup and they didn't do anything to correct it. They gave me a bottle from the cooler which was ok, but a sign should have been placed on the machine.

Went here for lunch. Not much curb appeal, but the inside is quite charming. It has an authentic Mexican décor. They have a wide variety of items, some that are not usually found on traditional Mexican menus. The food was excellent. We didn't leave here hungry. The only thing that was a little annoying, was they charged me 50 cents for using plastic instead of cash.

I was a kid again when I walked through the door. They have things there I haven't seen in years. Did you know they still make candy cigarettes? OMG! Fruit Stripe Gum! So many more memories of my favorite candy. The is a nice selection of toys. I came across a View Master 3D viewer with disks. I would have spent more time here, but it could have been hazardous to my pocketbook. The prices are reasonable enough, but I could have gone broke saving so much.

We got a flyer in the mail and decided to try this place despite the one bad review from a disgruntled patron. Let me tell you I'm Italian and picky about my pizza. So if I'm going to be impressed win me over with the pizza.     This restaurant is on the corner of a strip mall so the outside isn't impressive. When you walk through the door your nose is immediately greeted by fresh basil and garlic. The place is well lit as there are windows on 2 sides and one wall with a full length mirror to reflect the natural light and give a roomier appearance. The décor is appropriately Italian with soft Italian themed music in the background.      We were immediately greeted by our waitress and seated. We ordered a 12" pizza with 2 toppings. While the pizza was being made, the waitress brought out a small complimentary order of garlic bread. Our order was out in a reasonable amount of time and our sodas were refilled. The pizza is thin crust and hand tossed baked in a wood fired oven. The sauce is freshly made with pieces of fresh basil in it. The Italian sausage topping is bursting with flavor and the cheese is freshly grated.     After the meal we were greeted by Giorgio, the owner. He was interested in our experience as the waitress told him we were first time customers. He informed us that he makes everything fresh every day from the sauce to the pasta. He learned the secrets of Italian cooking in Italy where he grew up.    This restaurant has gained a new patron by winning this Italian over with its authenticity and cuisine. I am looking forward to experiencing more items from the menu.

Once again Yelp comes through. Over 1100 reviewers rate this place 4 1/2 star average. They were right on. One of my Yelp friends wrote a review that convinced me to come in for Therapy. My wife and I came here for lunch. First of all let me say parking shouldn't be a problem as there is a parking corral just behind the restaurant. The décor is tropical leaning toward a beach theme. We showed up around noon on a weekday and were seated immediately. Right away I got a coupon when I checked in for $3.99 salsa and chips. Our waiter brought them right out with our drinks.  I got the Ghost Burger. This comes in 2 sizes. The relapse size which is like a quarter pounder, and the rehab sized which is like the half pounder. After reading other reviews I knew I should only order the relapse size. The Ghost Burger rehab size comes with two relapse burgers grilled to order, blanketed in ghost pepper jack cheese and topped with crispy onions and fresh guacamole. The relapse size comes with one burger.  The chips and salsa were amazing. They use flour tortillas and deep fry them making the chips a crispy golden brown. The salsa is made fresh and has a little bite to it. The Ghost Burger is a fire ball of deliciousness. The burger was juicy and grilled to me specification perfectly. For a little added kick I asked for some siracha. I chose to have mine on a Kaiser roll. It's a little larger and held all the toppings well. We were planning to get dessert, but had no room. I will have to return to try some other unique burgers.

Yes I'm a fan. Frozen custard is not my favorite I prefer real ice cream, but they do it right. They have a different flavor every day of the month. Today I checked in at this location and got a free cup of the flavor of the day (caramel cashew). I think they have a pretty good burger also.

I came here because of the reviews. It was bookmarked on places to try. I could not tell you about the food because I didn't have any. I ordered a fat boy supreme and a diet coke. The cashier said the soda machine is broken and handed me a warm can of soda. It was 12 ounces and I'll bet I would have been charged for a 16 ounce fountain drink. I handed him my card to pay and he said that they only take cash. There was no sign stating this anywhere. I told him I needed to go to the ATM. I did not return. What a waste of time. Not a good way to run a business.

We got some coupons in the mail for free soda and hotdogs so I came here for those. I never really checked this place out before so I took some time to look around and compare it with my usual grocery store. As with any other store it's a crap shoot as to who has the lowest prices on any given day. This store is unique in that they compare prices on sale items with other major stores in the area. You know what you save by purchasing that item that day.   There were couple things that were not so good. My wife got a watermelon from there and it was rotten inside. Some of the other produce didn't look very fresh that day. They have bulk bins filled with things like candy, pasta, flour, nuts, cereal, and more  These are big barrels filled to the top with a plastic lid and a scoop attached. I don't like the idea of everybody digging into these barrels with dirty hands. Even if I wanted to believe everyone was careful when they scooped out of the bin, I just can't believe parents will always keep an eye on their kids. This is what I saw happen. A child about 5 was reaching in to a bin and digging around with his bare hands. He was eating out of it. The parents were not paying attention, or didn't care.   I never see sales flyers from this store so they have been flying under my radar for sometime. I will occasionally shop here when I get coupons or need a few items.

They were our realtor when we bought our house and they are our realtor as we are listing our house. Marc is our agent. He is fantastic. He is knowledgeable and has integrity. He works very hard to make sure his client's expectations are met, and then he does something else. He exceeds his clients expectations. When he came to do photos for the MLS. he took about 300 pictures to make sure he got the very best images of our property. Marc recommended an agent in the town we plan to relocate in. He gave us information on moving companies and also suggested we check out Coldwell Banker's loan department for a home loan. Marc is the reason I rate this agency so highly.

Coldwell Banker has been instrumental in our transition from Mesa AZ to Sturgeon Bay WI. Our Coldwell Banker Marc Maryland in Mesa referred us to Doris Bodener in Sturgeon Bay to help us purchase our new house. She has our best interests at heart. After several showings and some of repeat showings we finally found our home. Thank you Coldwell Banker for an outstanding job.

Takes a long time to get through the line. It's even worse before the snowbirds leave. They don't have enough workers and I've seen the line out the door and down the sidewalk.

This taco house is located in downtown Gilbert. We stopped here for lunch while shopping in town. We were greeted immediately. The seating host asked us if we wanted to sit inside or outside. I said we wanted an inside booth. We were seated outside under a tree. The waitress brought chips and salsa. While getting our drinks debris kept dropping out of the tree above us. I asked if we could go inside and we did. I ordered a burrito, "The Beast". This is a burrito made with carne asada, pinto beans, avocado, Pico de Gallo. and cheese wrapped up in a flour tortilla. I wasn't impressed with this Americanized burrito. It lacked flavor and was rather dry. I can't give this place more than a 2 star when Filaberto's has a better burrito for half the price.

I wanted to check this place out as a healthier option for brunch. Score! They have vegan, gluten free, organic, whatever your diet needs you can get it here. My wife and I shared a smoothie and a light snack of sprouted grain bread with mashed avocado or almond butter, and a small bowel of fruit. The food was good quality and the price was reasonable. After reviewing the menu, we'll be back to try more items. We also got a check in offer when we checked in on Yelp. Now I can also try the lemon aide free.

Had a popper burger. Best darned burger I ever had. 1/2 pound of flavor perfectly grilled. This monster with all the toppings was nearly impossible to take a bite out of. I had to take a to go box for the fries because I was too full to eat them. No wait for a table or food, but it was mid day on a Thursday, I can imagine on a busy travel day this place is packed with long waits. If you have time it is worth it.

I came here to hike the Goldmine trail. It was the challenge I expected. This trail started out flat and easy, but after I got all pumped like this is a cake walk the trail turned ugly. It was a steep climb up to the saddle. I needed to stop several times to catch my breath. Once at the top, the view of the east valley was breath taking. (What breath I had left.) The decent was as steep and treacherous with loose gravel making for poor footing. I did slip once. A trekking pole is advised. Once at the bottom we paid homage to 2 deceased prospectors buried just off the trail. There is a memorial in their honor. I hiked the Dynamite trail back to the trailhead. This is a less intensive hike. The trail meanders around the mountain I had just hiked up. This is a good hike to get your cardio on.

We came here for lunch on a Sunday. Located in the corner of Dana Park mall, this quaint little store has a trendy ambiance. There are plenty of tables set up for outside dining. This is good until the weather gets hot. We chose to eat inside. The grill area is open so you can actually watch your food being prepared. The seating is limited to several booths and about a dozen tables.  Our experience was pleasant. Our waitress was friendly and the service was prompt. Pita is what this place is all about. You get pitas with your salads or used as wraps in sandwiches. I ordered a pizza which was on, you guessed it, a pita. I was a little disappointed at the selection of burgers. they were "healthy burgers". All were veggie burgers of one kind or another. That's good for the vegetarian, but carnivores will be left wanting that juicy medium grilled 80/20 ground beef burger.  I will say that the pizza I ordered was surprisingly tasty. I got the roasted garlic portabella pizza. This was made on an ultra thin pita like crust, which made it very crispy once it's baked. This is my favorite style of crust. There was a modest amount of sauce and cheese, which was ok by me. After all for me it's about the toppings anyway. The toppings, roasted garlic, basil, Portabella mushrooms, and thinly sliced tomatoes. I enjoyed every bite, and it was under 10 bucks. You can't beat that at most places.   Now that I'm spoiled on this pita-pizza, I may not be able to get past that on the menu. I will try other items, but I want to experience the other pizzas first.

Grab plenty of napkins! An afternoon Father Day's lunch turned into a delicious stuffed burger endeavor which resulted in a full stomach and a pile of napkins the size of a small brush pile. I love the concept of building your own stuffed burger. Look out Burger King, at Stufrageous I can totally have it my way. I chose the brioche bun for my base. The burger is of course big enough to stuff with all the goodies you want. I chose one of the signature burgers which was the jalapeño melt. This is a burger stuffed with jalapeños pepper jack cheese and American cheese. I chose to have the lettuce, tomato, and onions on the side free of charge. I did not choose a topping, but got the outrageous sauce on the side. I also got fries. I got a free regular soda because I checked in and spent $8.00 or more.       The burger was medium well, just the way I like it. The burger was cut in half and laying in the basket cut side up. I think this was a subliminal suggestion as how to eat this thing. The cheese was ooey gooey and oozed out the sides. I tucked the lettuce, tomato, and onion neatly into each half drizzled the outrageous sauce on the burger and for good measures a couple shots of sriracha sauce. Now perplexed as to how to pick this monster up and manage a bite without loosing everything, it came to me. *Pay attention now* Don't try to eat it vertically or it all slides out. Pick it up as it lies in the basket and eat it more like you would a taco. As it is your fingers will be coated in juice, cheese, and sauce. Or you can be proper about it and just use a fork and knife.      The burger was truly an adventure through burgertopia. It was very tasty, it was very messy, and it was very satisfying. The fact that I can customize the burger, makes my best burger list. Oh and the fries, too salty. I'll have to remember to ask for lightly salted next time.

This is a hiking trail at Usury Park. I have hiked this trail for years. There are fantastic views of the Superstition Mountains and Four Peaks. The view of the east valley is breath taking. &.5 miles in length, this trail circles Pass Mountain. There are a couple short climbs, but nothing too intense. People mountain bike the trail, and you'll see an occasional horseback rider on the trail'   We hiked the trail today and saw the desert bloom in the early stages. The brittle bush were in bloom nicely. The Chupa Rosa bushes were just starting. Wesaw an Ocotillo cactus in full bloom and several wild desert flowers were just starting.   This hike is best from late September through early April. There is little shade so when the weather warms up and the sun is out it gets pretty toasty. and as always , bring plenty of water.

First of all I think Pizza Pie "Café" is a misnomer. They don't serve coffee. They have self serve soda and iced tea. Second this place is awesome. We came in and bought our meals. We were asked if this was our first experience here. It was and the girl told us all about the place. I don't understand other reviews about bad customer service. This is a buffet. You serve yourself. That's exactly what I did.   There is a pretty nice salad bar with fresh greens and plenty of toppings. several dressings to choose from. First course done.  There is a pasta station. How this works is you select either a half plate or a whole plate of one of several types of cooked pasta. This is where customer service may play a part. They will measure the specified quantity and submerge it for 30 seconds in boiling water to freshen it up and get it hot. They plate it and you ladle out the sauce of your choice. There are a 6 or 7 different kinds. I had the fettuccini with (I can't remember the name) a creamy sauce a with bacon flavor to it. It was pretty good. Second course finished.  The pizzas are made fresh. The crust is homemade every day, never frozen. There are about a dozen dinner pizzas and 8 dessert pizzas to choose from.  The pepperoni and sausage combo was ok. I likes the veggi pesto. That was my favorite. The crust is thin, (Score) and holds up to all the toppings. There is a little less sauce than I like. There is an adequate amount of cheese. (Can you tell I'm sort of a pizza snob?) Third course is history  The dessert pizzas are the highlight of the meal. The pizza of the month is a dessert pizza. "The Monster Cookie" This is a graham cracker crust topped with a coconut custard and sprinkled with chocolate chips. I could have made a meal of this. I also tried the raspberry pizza. This was like strudel. I had a piece of Oreo cookie pizza, also good. Fourth course, stick a fork in me I'm done.  I will be coming back here for sure. The buffet is $7,25 all day.

I came here for brunch on a happy chance. Score! this little hole in the wall was a winner. A small store front café in a strip mall, the interior is tastefully decorated, there is alfresco dining outside under the canopy. We sat down at a 4 top table. Gabriele herself waited on us. She told us about the day's special which was a meatball sandwich with a side of pasta salad included. After a few minutes we decided on 3 specials. The order was up within minutes.The sandwiches were very good. Gabriela told me they make their meatballs and sauce. The pasta salad was good also. I will be back to try some of the breakfast menu

Good old fashioned ice cream. That's what they have here. We stopped here for a sweet tooth fix after lunch down the street. They have about 30 different flavors. They even have blue moon ice cream which you only find once in a blue moon. I ordered a scoop of New York cherry. After I was almost finished the guy offered me another scoop on the house. He apologized for the first scoop being a little small. I did enjoy the ice cream. It was a good quality.

I made the trip from Mesa to San Tan Valley to Daily Yogurt because I know the owner and wanted to patronize his store. That being said, My experience here was blasé. The young man asked if it was my first experience here, then directed me to the back of the store where the self serve machines were located. The store was dark. The only light on was the one at the entrance. This made the place feel like a dungeon. There were several self serve cup sizes to choose from, No cones. As I worked my way past the many flavors of self serve frozen yogurt, I was impressed by the selection of flavors, some of which I never heard of that captured my interest.  I went with the Salted Caramel Corn. After I dispensed my frozen yogurt, I got to choose from quite a variety of self serve add ins. You can add as much or little as you want because you pay for your customized yogurt by weight. As I was heading to the check out guess what I noticed? Cones! I wish I would have known that to begin with. Don't you think they should have been near the dispenser area?  The frozen yogurt was great. I loved the salted caramel corn. I like the self serve concept. The price is reasonable. I was disappointed that it wasn't in a cone. I don't understand why the place was so dark. It felt gloomy so I ate outside. It's nice they give a discount to the local law enforcement. Give Dunkin Donuts a run for the money. On a final note, they had Karaoke scheduled for later that night. I did not stay around for that.   If you live in San Tan Valley, this place is a keeper, but for me it was not worth the 20 mile trip.

This is the first time I have been to a build your own pizza place. Already it's good because you get exactly the toppings you want. The crust is cracker thin, just the way I like it. They have 5 different sauces to choose from. several different cheeses and oodles of toppings. After the pizza is assembled the put it in a mega-hot oven and cook it until the cheese is melted and the crust is crispy. The pizza is ready in minutes and ready to enjoy. I will be back to try many more combinations.

I like Sprint and will probably be a life long customer. The stores and sales reps range anywhere from rude and stupid to smart and helpful. This store was one of the good ones. Carlos was my sales rep. I inquired about the "Pocket WIFI" they had on the display rack. Now keep in mind I'm an old guy and somewhat technologically challenged. Carlos explained exactly how it worked and calculated how much data I would use each month so I could get a plan that worked best for me. After talking with me further He determined that For $10.00 a month more I could get a basic smart phone and tether my laptop to it. That way I would have a mobile hotspot and unlimited data. It works well. I'm using it right now. They could have taken me to the cleaners, but instead set me up with mobile WIFI at the best possible price.

Sorry my review is going to lower your perfect 5 star rating, but I was not impressed with this place. The store is  open, clean, and well lit, the staff friendly and informative. That's the reason for two of the rating stars. I ordered a diet sprite with a chocolate shot and a cherry shot. What I got was watered down soda with a hint of flavor. My wife didn't even finish hers. There is a very limited selection of snacks. I got the popcorn. that was ok, a little salty. We left thinking " Well this was a bust". Sorry Fiiz, I'll stick to canned soda.

After posting my previous review, one of the owners promptly contacted me and apologized for my less than perfect experience. It was because of this review that he personally investigated the problem. It turned out to be an equipment failure. They had the problem fixed and invited me to have another soda on Fiiz. I came back the following week and ordered the exact same thing. The waiter upgraded it one size as well. This soda was a huge improvement over what I got the first time.   I think this is the hallmark of customer service when a business takes your bad experience and makes it right. For this reason I am listing Fiiz in my "Best Customer Service" list.

Only tried the apple fritter and the bear claw this time. This is my first experience at Bosa Donut. They have an impressive selection of donuts and pastries. It would take 2 months to try them all if you tried a different one every day. The donuts are fresh. The apple fritter was deep fried to a crispy outside and not doughy inside (Which was my experience at another place). I really loved the bear claw. It was soft and light with an apple pie topping, all that with a light glaze. They served a pretty good cup of coffee also. I am looking forward to trying more of these delicious treats.

I came here right after they opened. So new they weren't on Yelp yet. This is a nice restaurant with good food. They have traditional Chinese cuisine. There are seafood, pork, beef and chicken dishes typical of most takeout venues. There are combo specials which include an egg roll, fried rice, a crab puff and egg drop soup. They offer a few popular lunch specials at a smaller price.  My wife and I came here for dinner on a Sunday. As we were going in two ladies were going out with to go boxes. They gave us the thumbs up and said it was very good food.We were seated immediately. The waitress took our order. the food was up in just a few minutes. We ordered a large plate of garlic shrimp which we shared. this came with a good sized bowl of white rice. I found the garlic shrimp very good, my wife thought it was a little spicy. I asked if they delivered. They do not. They do have take out though. Just an FYI, they only take plastic or cash. No checks.  I will be back to sample more of the menu.

Today is the grand opening. I stopped in because I saw the promotion on the morning news. This is a build your own pizza place. They make it right before your eyes. Select a crust, choose your toppings, and get your pizza minutes later. The pizza is great. Thin and crispy, baked perfectly. I especially liked the spicy red sauce. There were managers and top people from the home office present to welcome all the new patrons. They took time to tell us about the pizza and about the company's history.This is worth the trip to Tempe.

First of all they just opened so be patient with the staff until they get familiar with things. They are still working out the kinks. I came in to check out the place and to try the wings.The server was Asia. She seated my wife and I immediately. I ordered a Bud. They have most domestic beers on tap. After reviewing the menu (which is pretty impressive) I decided on the Diablo's Fuego wings. They are the hottest. I also ordered onion rings.  The food was up in a reasonable amount of time. The wings were good. Not the hottest I've ever had. They had a good chili flavor and were good and saucy. The onion rings were deep fried to a crispy golden brown. They use real onions. Believe it or not I have been to places that serve the frozen manufactured onion rings. I thought the batter was perfect. They have oil hot enough to cook the rings without being oily.  I talked to Ryan, the chef and he told me he was working on a hot wing to use for a challenge. I can't wait for that. Mike the owner took the time to introduce himself to us. They have 15 TV screens and hope to fill the place every Sunday during football season.  I am looking forward to trying some of the burgers and sliders here. I will be back for sure

I saw on their Facebook page that today BullPen was offering a 2 for one deal on burgers today. I was all over that. I had a hard time deciding between wings or burger last time. Good thing I went with the wings so I could get the burger deal this time.   We had the same waitress, sat in the same booth. The place had a handful of customers, so not particularly busy. As I said in my pervious review they have a few things to work on. Service is one. It's still a little slow. I ordered the Smokewagon burger. This is a double decker with bacon, Monterey Jack cheese, and jalapeño chutney on a steakhouse bun. I ordered some Diablo sauce just to kick it up a little. This order came with fries.  This was one of the best burgers I've had. The burgers were cooked perfectly. Kudos to Ryan the chef there. It was juicy and flavorful. Trying to finish it was a job. These are 2 quarter pound burgers. The fries were just ok. They were the thin cut kind, not my favorite. A little Diablo sauce made the fries interesting.   This will go into my best burger list.
