Irked by the fact that showing my Costco card to the people at the exit when I am only there to get pizza is forbidden.  Um, never had this problem at any other Costco. I showed the lady my card and she tells me I have to go to the other side and show my card to the other lady. UHH does she have a special card scanner at the entrance? NOPE. She is just a worker standing by the door like you. I know it's not a big deal to walk around the counters to get to the food court, but stupidity and a lack of common sense really annoy me.

I'm a social worker who visits homes in central Phoenix and this is my go to McDonald's when I need a cheap coffee or if I need to use the bathroom. This is the cleanest/safest McDonald's in the area and I never hesitate to stay here to do work if I'm feeling too cheap to hit up Starbucks. I've encountered the occasional weirdo, but I don't feel too bad when a non-weirdo is sitting on the other side of me. There are also TVs that usually play CNN or FOX (not sure). It's nice to hear the news while I'm sitting inside doing case notes! Highly recommend this location!

What in the heck happened to the portion sizes at IHOP? Back in the day, I used to walk out of this place with a full belly, ready to collapse on the couch. This time, I found myself picking off my son's plate! My husband's omelette was smaller than my son's that we ordered off the kids menu! Weird... just weird. I don't think we'll be coming back. I'll stick with the Good Egg.

I was craving pie and beer after watching fireworks on fourth of july. It was about 10:30 and the Village Inn closed at midnight so I listened to yelp and decided to pick up some pie here. The manager was really friendly and I decided on the strawberry rhubarb pie. The pie was soooooo good. Better than Marie Callendars! I definitely plan on coming here on a wednesday to try out the other pies for free! YUM.

Oh BJ's... your manager saved you from getting a 2 star review. We came here to watch the Sharks during the NHL playoffs which was also during the NBA playoffs. Not even exaggerating, EVERY single TV had basketball on... so we asked our server if they could turn ONE TV to the sharks game. So they did and some douche bag at the bar gets upset because the TV in front of him was changed even when there were tons of seats at the bar right in front of the other TVs. Anyways, long story short guy complains, bartender agrees it was stupid to change it, and they change it back to basketball. We were pissed but thankfully, the manager did his rounds to make sure everything was okay and ended up changing another TV for us where we had a good view. Thank you!  We come here very often during football and hockey season. Happy Hour is great, but make sure you sit in the bar area to get HH prices. The great white pizza is amazing, and so is the pizookie! I like it here because it's a great place to come with the family and have a beer!

I guess this is an east coast/midwest thing because I really don't get it. I'm not a picky eater and I HATE wasting food and money, but I could not finish my plate. I ordered french toast and I was not aware that my french toast was going to be deep fried. Seriously, when I put my fork through it, a piece of fried toast hit me in the eye. My husband was also not impressed with his food. If someone would like to suggest something delicious on the menu that I should try, please let me know because I currently want to vomit every time I see a Chompie's.

Oh Tom, you really are my friend in the diamond business. Possibly my best friend. My husband bought my engagement ring here and it is BEAUTIFUL. After he popped the question, he couldn't wait to tell me about his experience at Shane Co. He was helped by a woman who had a great deal of knowledge and took the time to show him different diamonds and educate him on what to look for. Compared to other jewelry stores, he felt absolutely no pressure and he loved the free lifetime warranty. Now that I have my ring, I too love the lifetime warranty. I get my ring cleaned every month and get it buffed and polished every 6 for absolutely free!! I sometimes compare my ring to other women who have bigger diamonds, and I can tell that mine is of better quality. We last minute decided to elope on 11/11/11 and won't get our wedding bands until the real wedding... but let me just say that I am SO excited to get my wedding band. I know it's going to be gorgeous! SO to all the men looking for the perfect ring, definitely check out Shane Co!

I just recently found out that you must bring your paperwork with you every time you get your jewelry cleaned. After they clean it, they sign your paperwork to show that you've been getting your jewelry checked and have been taking care of it. If you don't have them sign it and a certain amount of time passes, you lose the warranty and can't get anything replaced if you lose something! I really wish someone would have told me or my husband. The first time I was asked for my paperwork was a couple months ago and I was finally given an explanation after I asked why they were suddenly asking for my paperwork. Womp womp... loss of one star for not telling me sooner :(

My new favorite bagel place! One morning I was in the mood for a bagel, but didn't want to go to the usual chain restaurant that I live by. Checked yelp and drove a few miles south to check his place out. The food was delicious and the service was amazing. I didn't realize there was a check in deal and when I told the lady I heard about this place on yelp, she reminded me that I get 6 free bagels just for checking in. Uh whattt! Most places never mention their check in deals. Some places even refuse to honor them! 5 stars for the food and service!

Home Depot used to be my hell. Whenever I accompanied my husband to Home Depot, I'd immediately start complaining about the concrete floor hurting my feet. I was whiny and ungrateful until Pinterest came along. Now that I feel creative from stealing ideas on the internet, I'll show my husband a picture and say "can you do this? will home depot make this possible?", and so far the answer is always yes! Home Depot always has what we are looking for and the workers always know what they are talking about. My husband once worked at a Home Depot and admits that most of the people he worked with didn't know anything. He approves of all the workers here and looks for the older guys for advice (lol). Also, we bought our Christmas tree here for $20 and it was big and beautiful! We saw the same size trees down the street for 3x the price! Love this place.

Food isn't great except for the tots... the tots are delicious. I also really like the $1 mini candy deserts. It's just the right size and so yummy! But ultimately, the 4 stars are for the drinks. Cherry and strawberry limeades, watermelon slushy.. the possibilities are endless. This place is a nice treat when the weather gets warm!

If you get really excited while watching football then I suggest not coming here to watch your favorite team. I came here one Sunday afternoon for some wings, a beer, and my favorite team and ended up getting in trouble for throwing an "fbomb". LAME. I was throwing obscenities within my own table.. but my bad, that's not allowed at a "family place". Note to parents: if you're bringing your child to a sports bar on a Sunday filled with grown men and alcohol, expect the worst. I went to a NNY in Anthem and loved it. People yell and scream (yeah even bad words =X) and no one gets in trouble. That's the way sports are meant to be watched!   BTW, I know 2 people who got food poisoning from their greasy wings. Enough said.

I almost lost my faith in mexican food in Arizona. All of the "bertos" suck and I was finding places that didn't offer carne asada.. wth? Anyways, this place makes me less homesick. Food is yummy and prices are dirt cheap. I'm a really big fan of the #18! 2 carne asada burritos with beans and rice for $7.95! Just pour some pico de gallo on that burrito and it will hit the spot mmmm

I'll make this short. I was craving a gyro, and the one I got at Pita Jungle definitely hit the spot. It was delicious, a good size, and decently priced. Also, the workers are very friendly which is always a plus. I left with a full stomach and a smile on my face... love it when that happens!

Um, thanks yelpers for the LIES!   So i woke up from a nap today and me and the little child growing inside of me NEEDED a burrito. I told the bf to get on yelp and Someburros showed up with tons of reviews and a good amount of stars.  We arrive at Someburros and I see a good number of people inside so I'm thinking there's hope.. I've finally found a good mexican place in Arizona! But HAH! was I wrong.... let me break it down for you:  -I ask the girl if she has what I've been craving.. a big carne asada burrito. You know, the kind you can get at all other normal mexican restaurants? She says "oh we don't have carne asada here, we only have shredded beef and ground beef". (UH wtf?)  -we order a shredded beef burrito with some kind of sauce, then we ask what comes in it.. the girl says "just meat and sauce". We ask if we can put anything else in it and she says no. We look at the menu and all of their burritos have basically nothing in them!  - We realize that their burritos are basically giant soft taquitos, so we order this deep fried chicken burrito thing that's on sale on Wednesdays because it looked like it had the most ingredients in it.   -The chicken thing comes out, and for being "on sale" for 5 dollars, it was pretty small for the price.  I left full, but unhappy. It's definitely better than that nasty Filibertos, but at least Filibertos has carne asada!! If anyone knows of a good place to get a burrito, PLEASE send me a message.

OMG TOTT'S IS BACK?! thank you Yelpers for letting me know. I found out Tott's left when I went on Yelp to leave an awesome, overdue review. Let me just say that I was devastated when they closed down and every time I craved chinese food, I thought about Tott's and fell into a slight depression.   This place is amazing because of the food and the very friendly customer service. The food is delicious and does not leave you with that " i ate so much, i need to throw up" feeling. The food isn't dripping with grease like most asian places.  The owner is such a nice man. I came here often when I was pregnant and everything sounded so good, I couldn't stop ordering. The owner (who i call Mr. Totts) would tell me to not order so much because the servings were so big. LOL who does that? He made me stop spending money, I appreciated that. Anyways, even after I had the baby, he still recognized us and remembered what we usually ordered. I love that.   Thanks for coming back to us Tott's. Life is complete again.

This review is for my fellow moms and dads! Some of us are not a-holes like Mr. Wynn and have our children carried by nannies everywhere. We were roaming around Vegas with our 3 month old and decided to hit up the Wynn buffet. As soon as we get in, a man stops us and tells us that "Mr. Wynn does not allow strollers because it is a safety hazard". Right.... and if everyone pushed around a Gucci stroller would it still be as dangerous? That's some BS baby discrimination, so we left! I think those with families should not support this place. You're an a-hole "Mr. Wynn"!!

I prefer this location over the one at the Biltmore. Why? The place is smaller so your server is less likely to forget about you, and people watching is way more fun in Scottsdale. Happy hour here is amazing. My fiance and I can get away with stuffing our faces for under $20 if we don't buy any drinks. HH is from 3-7, but I would recommend coming in before 5 to beat the crowds coming in after work. I try to avoid this place when it gets busy because the seating is really cramped!   Also, for parents, there is no room for strollers here and there are no changing tables. I think places like this have a little baby discrimination... people sometimes glare at us when we walk in with our child (even when he's being super quiet). I guess sushi is too cool for babies. My suggestion is to bring the little one in the carseat because he/she will fit just fine in a booth or on the chairs on the patio and go when it's not crowded!

I felt very compelled to write an update and give stingray an extra star! So I went against my own advice... I came here on a friday, after five, during happy hour, with a stroller. But, I couldn't help myself! We were in the area and I was so hungry.   Anyways, we walk in and it's packed inside and we feel like a nuisance coming in with our 8 month old! The hostess tries to figure out how to fit us inside since it was so hot outside and the manager comes and decides that they can get us a highchair, sit us at the sushi bar,  and have us park our stroller by the door. This was the first time we've ever been offered a highchair! And I was happy that they didn't think the stroller by the door was an eye sore. I REALLY appreciated the manager trying to accommodate us quickly. We've definitely been in situations where even the management  gives us dirty looks for bringing a baby to the establishment. But hey! We are young parents who like bringing our little dude out with us :)  We get seated and our server and the manager we're super nice the whole time. He often came over to check on us and refill our water glasses. This was the best service we've ever experienced at this location. So I just wanted to say.. I know Stingray is a trendy place catering to good looking singles during happy hour, but thank you for being so accommodating to this family :)

I love the vast selection of beer and the ability to taste a couple before making your decision. It also helps to have a server be knowledgable so you can pin point what type of beer you might like. I ended up getting the Leinenkugel's sunset wheat. It tasted like fruity pebbles! I found the food to be a little pricey. I would suggest to come here during happy hour. We had just missed happy hour, so we shared a small pizza and a salad and the bill came out to almost $50 with 2 beers. Also, I love the music that plays here. Overall, it's a nice fun place to eat, drink, and dance in your chair.

The moment we walked into this place, it was alllll bad! It breaks my heart to write this review because back home Maggiano's was one of my favorite restaurants. I've always thought this place had good food and that the prices were fair for the huge portions, so I was super excited to find one here in Arizona. BUT this location sucked and i'm  sad that i won't be returning.   Right when we walked in, we were greeted by the manager who asked us how we were doing. My bf and I politely answer, then for a good 5 seconds there was complete silence. I look at him like dude, be normal and say "just two?" or "how many?" Instead he looks at me, makes this rude gesture with his head and has this look on his face like "what do you want?" So I'm like... "uhhh.. table for two." Anyways, I try to ignore his rudeness.. but me and my bf were like wow.. what's this guy's deal?   Anyways, after Mr. Incompetent seats us, the entire dining experience kept going down hill:  -Loss of 1 star: Dirty Dishes. I'm usually the kind of person who doesn't speak up when I'm unhappy with something at a restaurant, but as we were waiting for our food we noticed the small plates and the wine glasses were super dirty! I was pretty grossed out so I asked the waitress (without trying to be annoying) to take it off the table.  -Loss of 2 stars: Slow Service. I started to get really annoyed when it took forever to bring out our bread. I just drooled as I saw people who were seated after us munching away on their bread. We finally got the bread once our first entree came out which was ridiculous. They were also really slow with refilling our drinks. At one point, I just started chewing ice .  -Loss of 3 stars: Rude service. In addition to the dumb manager in the front, our waitress was a little biatch! My bf asked her if we could have more olive oil and balsamic vinegar and as he was speaking, she looked at him and walked away! Then she came back and said she would bring it out... as she walked away from our table the ladies sitting at the table next to us say "well that was a nice eye roll". I was like oh hell no, did she roll her eyes at us?! Then the ladies next to us started complaining about the service and said they had been waiting for their check for a while and they had no idea where their server was.   -Loss of 4 stars: Smaller Portions. I always get the same thing back home; a salad and a chicken and spinach manicotti. When the manicotti came out, I was shocked! It was a lot smaller than usual! I usually think the dish is worth the $15, but this definitely was not worth the money. It looked like it was missing a big chunk!! I was sooooooo sad!   It was just a bad experience overall. In all the times I have been to a Maggiano's, I have never left with such negative feelings! I guess I'll have to wait till I go back home to have my chicken manicotti again :(

I LOVE the drive-in. 2 movies for $6.50 and I can bring my infant without worrying about him getting fussy and disturbing others during the movie makes me a happy girl. The building is a bit outdated, and the bathrooms are a little dirty, but my first time here I was super relieved that I didn't have to pop a squat or use a porta potty (ew). I also love the fact that I can enjoy my own drinks and snacks without having to resort to hiding everything in my purse... but we occasionally buy a drink or popcorn when the man over the radio executes a guilt trip by reminding us that the cheap prices are due to the support of the concession stand.   Oh and a few tips: when you pull in and you happen to be facing another car, please TURN OFF your lights! Blinding people is not nice. Don't smoke if you are parked next to others... not everyone enjoys the smell of cigarettes or weed . And lastly, although we are outside, no one likes it when their movie is disturbed, so teach your children the importance of being quiet during movies or go for a walk away from the crowd if they can't settle down.

The most entertaining thing about Costco is watching the crowd go crazy for free samples. But shoot, who am I to judge? Free sample of chicken wings? Hell yes, I've never tried chicken wings before!! It's really crowded here on the weekends so watch your back in the store and in the parking lot. I saw a fight break out between two old guys in the parking lot and one of them chased the other into the store. Quite entertaining! Costco is best for toilet paper, eggs, diapers, and bread. It's also great when you're hungry and need a quick dinner. $1.50 hotdog and drink, amazing. Just remember the only credit card you can use  at Costco is American Express so bring cash or your debit card (I'd say or a check book, but do people still do that?) Also, the food court only takes cash so get cash back while checking out! Have fun!

Just like every other Wells Fargo, nothing special. No drive thru ATM, but the drive thru is open during business hours. Minus one star for the overly excited manager. I've realized that Wells Fargo is big on customer service and pretending like they care about what you are doing with your day, but the manager at this one is just too much. It's a constant "well we are sooooo glad to help you out today with whatever you need!!!" in a high pitched voice. I just put my head down and pray that she doesn't talk to me. Is it really that hard to be genuine?

Ugh, the moment I walked into this place, I felt really awkward. We came here for our friend's surprise birthday dinner. It was about 6 o'clock on a Friday evening and as we're walking towards the door we see 2 women stumbling out completely wasted. Come on ladies, it's 6 o'clock.. what are you doing with your lives?  We walk in and the lay out is really awkward. If you've never been there and you're there for more than alcohol, it's not exactly clear what to do or how to get a waitress' attention. So we sit down and search the menu for anything without meat since it's a Friday and it is Lent. Sadly, the menu only had cheese pizza and a veggie burger. We ended up getting jalapeno poppers and a veggie burger and both were disgusting.    In addition to the disgusting meal, the patrons and the workers were grimey. Let me just break it down:  (1) There are no designated smoking areas. Patrons and employees were walking around smoking around everybody. It was disgusting.  (2) The crowd is a bit older... there was a lot of mid-life crisis resonating in the air. Let me just use this as an example. One of the guy's in our group paid to have a fire set up outside by our table. This old guy and his old lady dressed in dirt-biking outfits take a couple chairs and sit down right in front of me, blocking the warmth of the fire from me and my 5 month old. Thanks guy!  So the waitress goes up to the old guy and asks him what he would like to drink, and he says " i'm on a motorcycle, so i'll have a diet coke". Great to know guy... I think she asked what you wanted to drink, not what your mode of transportation was.         So 8 o'clock comes and the employees are letting us know of this ridiculous rule to have all children out by this time. So as were getting the kids ready, the guy in our group who paid for the fire, tons of drinks, and food says to us how he thinks it's a bad idea for business to kick people out by 8 o'clock and how he thinks they're losing money. Out of nowhere, the old guy on the cool motorcycle starts arguing with us about how he knows they're not losing money and he knows because he's been going there for 20 years. WTH? WAS ANYONE TALKING TO YOU? First of all old man, business is being lost because the man who paid for the fire you are sitting by is a millionaire and now he's never going back to this place and he's going to let all his rich friends know. Second, 8 o'clock is super early, and people don't start going out to the bars until at least 10 o'clock. Maybe people went out earlier 20 years ago, but times have changed grandpa.   (3) This was a main complaint from other people in our party, but this place does not have a full bar. You'll have to settle for a beer, margarita, or sneaking in your own flask to get a good buzz.  -Sorry for my rant, but this place sucked. I'm usually not picky about my food, I usually enjoy the outdoors, and I'm usually a nice person. BUT if you like second hand smoke, crappy food, rude old men, inappropriately dressed sabertooths, and a lack of good alcohol then BY ALL MEANS, check this place out.

Definitely the weirdest/fanciest grocery store I have ever been in. We just moved to this area and I feel like a Beverly Hills housewife when I shop here. Came here last friday night for groceries and I walked by people watching sports updates and drinking wine while I shopped for produce. There is also free valet, covered parking, car wash service while you shop, an area to take cooking classes, and a book section with a sliding ladder! This place is like a one stop shop!   Prices here are about the same as any other fry's. Look out for items on sale and the participating items for the "buy 10 get $5 off" deal. With sale items and our fry's card, we bought a ton of food for about $75. Nice to save a lot of money and feel like a million bucks doing it!   Oh and try the fried chicken, it's dellliiiicious.

This place has really bad reviews on hotels.com but I was surprised to not see anyone yelp about it! A yelp review would have been really helpful, so here I go..  I was VERY happy with my stay here. I was really hesitant to book a room here because of all the bad reviews, but I didn't want to spend alot of money and I needed a place that was dog friendly. Upon arrival the man behind the counter was very friendly. I had about 10 million questions about where things were located and he was very helpful. Our room was nice and big and very clean. It kind of smelled like paint when we first came in, but it eventually went away. The AC was nice and cold, the beds were comfy, and the maids were very accommodating as well. Also, the pool was great, people seemed to only swim at night, but I was trying to take advantage of the Arizona sun for an awesome tan, so I always had the pool to myself! Overall, it was a great deal, a goodnight stay for 39.99! If you're on a budget, I highly recommend this place!

There's one word that best describes this place: Ehhh. NO really, it's nothing special and it's definitely on my list of mexican places to avoid in Arizona. Yes, I'm one of those annoying people who like to compare everything to California... so this is for my northern Californians who are searching for a place as good as La Vic's :(  I came here last fall after a night of drinking, and of course, like any other drunk person I just wanted some greasy ass mexican food. I got the carne asada fries and I remember them satisfying my craving.  Fast forward almost a year, my bf and I were starving and just needed a quick fix in the middle of lunch and dinner. We head over to Filibertos (completely sober btw) and order the carne asada fries. What a freakin disappointment... the fries were super bland and I felt like I had to force myself to finish them even though we were really really hungry.  Moral of the story: Filibertos is only good when drunk. But then again, Denny's is like a 5 star restaurant after a night of drinking. So all I can really say about this place is ehhhhh...

2 stars for the stupid kids who work here. I'm pretty desperate for boba when i'm in Arizona since I don't have the luxury of having a boba place in every freakin corner like i do back home....... so i might will be back, but i'll make sure to make my order crystal clear to the kids who work here.  So I went in a couple weeks ago, and this girl working the register is totally staring into space as i'm ordering. Now it's like a million degrees outside so I'm definitely craving something cool and refreshing, nothing milky. I tell this girl... "I want two jasmine green teas". I made sure to make myself clear.... i did NOT say jasmine MILK tea, i said jasmine green tea since this has happened to me at this location before.  When my drinks are done, the teenage boy yells "2 jasmine milk teas". OMG. Did i not make myself clear??? SO i explain to this boy, i wanted jasmine green teas, i didn't order a milk tea. And he gives me the craziest look and says " sooooooo you just want green tea?" So i repeated myself and he says " soooooo you don't want milk?" YES CHILD, THAT'S WHAT I SAID! Do you not make that here? Omg I never had an issue ordering a jasmine green tea back home with workers who could barely speak english!!! I was so annoyed.  I took my teas since i had already created so much confusion behind the counter. Ugh, i must find another boba place in this state!

I know this is a very long review, but if you are looking for a clinic, especially for your children, please take the time to read this.  This clinic has 2 locations and according to the receptionist, the same staff works at both locations so I will write my review even though this horrible experience occurred in Mesa. Before I begin my yelp vent session, I would just like to say PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE! I was so upset after our appointment today that I was literally shaking and stumbling over my words because I did not appreciate how my family was treated today.   We found this clinic a few months ago when my son was dropped from my insurance and needed to get his immunizations and regular check-ups. I was in graduate school at the time, so the best option was to find a clinic for my baby that gave us the option of affordable payments. The few times we came here, we never had a problem with the staff. Even with an appointment, we would still end up waiting for a while, but the nursing assistants were nice, and the Nurse Practitioner Jennifer was very kind and helpful. Although we would only make an appointment for immunizations, Jennifer would make sure the baby was measured and weighed, supplied us with print outs of his percentile information, and speak to us about his development and our concerns. For all of this, we would pay about $50.   We made an appointment for today at 4 o'clock, and we are not seen until 5:45. We were expecting the usual visit until the nursing assistant asks us if we are there for his immunizations or a well baby check up. I told the girl that we would like a check up as well if it was possible and she says very rudely " well what did you pay for?" I was like whoa.....??? excuse me? SO she goes on to tell us that we only made an appointment for his shots so I'm like ok? no biggie, if they don't want to talk to us about the baby then fine!   So in walks the Nurse Practitioner and to our surprise, it's not Jennifer. The NP (cannot remember her name) seemed nice at first. She told us we would have to make a separate appointment for the well baby check up and in my confusion I explained how Jennifer used to integrate everything into one appointment. From my explanation, she then sat down and began asking questions about my son's development. So I thought cool, this appointment will go like past appointments.   So after speaking with the NP, the rude nursing assistant comes in with the immunizations and tells us that our bill will come out to $75. Um, hm.. excuse me, I'm pretty sure we only pay $50 when we come here. She then says "well you can talk to Sam if you don't want to pay this". We all walk over to Sam, the receptionist, and nursing girl starts going off saying that we are refusing to pay the bill. Sam checks our records and tells her that according to our previous visits, we were only charged $50. The nursing girl throws a fit, gets angry because she wants to go home, throws the paper down and says " WELL THEN YOU GUYS FIGURE IT OUT", and slams the door. Wow, well that was professional.   I tell Sam that if this is causing her too much trouble then we will pay the $75, but I don't feel comfortable with the rude nursing girl giving my baby his shots. Sam then asks if we want the other girl (who used to always see us but happened to not be working that day) to see us next time. I tell Sam that she can call us back when she finds out about the other girl's work schedule.   As we're planning this out, the NP comes in and says that we need to pay the $75 because the well check up was $25. First of all, this pissed me off because she never made us aware that is was $25. And second, we explained to her how Jennifer integrated it all into one visit, so I figured we had an understanding. And 3rd, really? $25 to ask me five questions about my sons eating and pooping, and giving me advice that I already know. Totally not worth it. Plus, she never even gave me a print out of his height and weight percentile. We explain to the NP what our understanding was and she begins talking to us like we are idiots, going step by step over what she said. Look here lady, maybe if you took the time to talk to your patients, you would know that I am very well educated and I don't need to be spoken to like a 5 yr. old.   Anyways, the NP said she would do the shots instead of her assistant and rushed through it so she could go home. We paid $50, but felt super mad, irritated, and disrespected. I don't understand how this place hired such unprofessional people, and their lack of empathy and people skills make me wonder why they even chose the medical field. Thankfully my benefits from work are in effect in October so i can get a real pediatrician for my son. But for those who are in a bind and unable to be covered by insurance, please find another clinic! I would hate for other families, especially those with babies to be treated so poorly by these people

Came here for the first time after some fun apartment hunting. It was cloudy, hot, and I was feeling horrible from a bad cold. I figured a little bit of comfort food would make me feel better, and even with the hot weather, I wanted some soup! My fiance and I shared a spicy cuban sandwich and a bowl of broccoli cheddar soup. Both were super good, and I felt much much better. Although I loved our meal, I think the 5 star rating is thanks to the cranberry oatmeal cookie. O-M-G it was the most moist, most delicious cookie I have ever had. WOW sooo soft mmmm.. and the cranberries reminded me of thanksgiving. Get that cookie, you won't regret it!

Almost as good as mom's cooking! Everything was delicious and I loved the little band that was playing while we ate. I would have probably given them 5 stars if they let me sing karaoke...

I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is traveling with a family. I went to Vegas for my annual girls trip, but this year was different since I had to bring my man and my 3 month old! The trump appealed to us because it is a non-smoking property, so we didn't have to worry about the baby being exposed to anything.   We got into the city a little earlier than expected so I called in and they said I could come in anytime I was ready. Our room was amazing. I loved the shower, the amazing tub, and the TV in the bathroom mirror. My body just melted into the bed, and I loved the robes! Having the kitchen was nice so we could cool our drinks and heat up bottles for our little man. When we needed wine glasses and a bottle opener, they were at our door in no time, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The next day we asked for a late checkout and they let us pick what time we wanted to leave! Crazy!  The only downside was our noisy neighbors who decided to have a little hotel party before going out. I don't know why these mid 30's idiots couldn't go to the strip and act like morons there instead of making noise in their rooms till 2 in the morning. But it's not the hotel's fault for dumb guests!  Anyways, I really enjoyed my stay! I will definitely return Mr. Trump!

I've always been a fan of Elephant Bar and I found this location to be just as nice as the others. I ordered the pad thai and requested it to be extra spicy. My bf got the jalapeno burger. Both were really good! And our server was very helpful.

We got the "fruits of the forest" and pineapple gelato. Holy.. it was like I was eating a smoothie with a spoon! So delicious, light, and I loved the chunks of fruit. If this place were closer, it would be my summer dessert spot!

Man, haters are gonna hate! The cupcakes here are AMAZING. Extremely moist and delicious. If you think it's too sweet, then don't eat a damn cupcake! If you've never been here, I suggest trying the Red Velvet. Red Velvet never fails, and I've never met a person who didn't like it. My other favorites are carrot and strawberry, but be very careful about trying new flavors. I once tried the chai latte and it made me sad.   And yes, the cupcakes are $3.50 and no, you won't feel privileged or special for spending that on a cupcake. Currently, $3.50 is less than a gallon of gas... or a cup of coffee. So let's just all calm down about the prices. And P.S. to those who can make the same tasting cupcakes from a box, please drop those cupcakes off at my house. I will be very impressed because as of right now, I'm pretty sure that's impossible. OH and one more thing: don't waste money on the mix that's sold in the store. It is not the same. Hope this was helpful!

This place is Okay. Not delicious, and not disgusting. Its whatever. My quesadilla  was good for the first couple bites.. then it started tasting like Chinese food. Weird? Whatev, I killed it cuz I had a long drive home. My friend had a "Killer Burrito" and she enjoyed it! I guess it depends on what you get.  Oh also it seemed a little over priced (minus another star for that).. I got a quesadilla with guacamole and sour cream, and a Jarrito for 14 dollars! wtf.. are there taco trucks in Arizona?

It's pretty much a given that In-N-Out is amazing and if you don't like it, then there is something very wrong with you. So this rating is for the service. This is probably the busiest location, but the food comes out pretty quick considering all the people. I didn't realize how great the service was here until I went to an empty In-N-Out in North Scottsdale and my food took forever. Oh and quick tips, my favs are a neapolitan shake and animal fries, YUM!

Food isn't the best, but it's decent. Games are fun especially basketball. And the watermelon margaritas are delicious! I used to go to D&B back home in the Bay Area to have a drunken good time with friends and I used to wonder why there were so many kids around during the late hours. Well, now I get it! This is a great place to have a drink and entertain the kids. It's like a bar where children are allowed. SO grab a drink, order an appetizer, play some games, keep an eye on your kid, and make sure you have a DD. I guarantee you'll have a good time.   Oh and if you happen to come here with a big group, I suggest ordering your drinks and food from the bar. It will come faster and you'll avoid the gratuity!

When I'm broke but have an expensive appetite.. and the yearning to get slightly tipsy, this place does the job. I love getting the Las Vegas rolls, and basically anything with cream cheese.. top it off with some sakebombs and wohoo, I'm a happy girl! It's not as fancy as RA, but I love the chill atmosphere. Definitely one of my favorite places out here!

I agree with a fellow yelper from a review below, this is NOT a legit boba place! I definitely don't come here when I'm craving boba and the teas served here do not go well with boba. BUT I do love the teas here, they are quite delicious. I'm a fan of the fruity ones... the flavors are light and refreshing and taste great iced or hot. If you're indecisive like me, take one of their overwhelming menus to a table and take your time deciding. There are so many choices and it gets really awkward trying to decide by the counter while the worker waits for you. You might get pressured into something not so yummy!

I have a strange addiction to Target. I must go at least once a week, and although I always have the intent of buying one thing... I'll walk out with ten things. There's something about this place that makes me want to wander the aisles and find things that I somehow forgot I "needed". Anyways, this Target is my favorite. It's clean, staff is nice, customers aren't sketchy, and it's conveniently located by many other stores. Some things to check out while here:  (1) DVDs!!! Holy, they have some good deals. It seems like they change the discounts on dvds every 1 or 2 weeks. I'll see movies (even fairly new ones) full price one week, then extremely marked down the next. Target has created a dvd obsession in me!  (2) UP and UP products! Just as good as brand name items! I especially love up and up for their diapers, wipes, and formula. I save SO MUCH money by buying generic. The diapers work great and my son has no complaints about his up and up soy formula!  (3) Baby clothes! Just a couple days ago, I bought 4 (12 months size) shirts for my son and spent $10! 2 of the shirts were under $2 and all were very cute. Even when there isn't a sale, you can find shirts, shorts, and pants for $4 each!   I've noticed that if you look around you'll often see items that are full price one week, on sale the next, and back to regular price not too long after. I bought my son a fisher price toy for $20 and right now it is currently back to its regular price of $35. SO have fun finding great items and saving tons of money!

wth?! why does Lucille's only have 3 stars?! this place is amazingly delicious and I'm glad I didn't read the yelp reviews before coming here.  So let's make this short... I got the tri-tip sandwich and mac and cheese since the waiter suggested both. It was amazing!!!! The meat was sooo good, and the sauces were delish. I have never had mac and cheese that delicious in my life. Also, I don't know why people are saying the prices are high.. it seemed pretty standard for a sit down restaurant.   Anyways, I'm 8 months pregnant and since Lucille's, bbq has become my new obsession!! I've never had bbq from the south or anything, but I've tried a couple other bbq places around the area and I have yet to find a place as good as Lucille's.

The yelp check-in offer does not work! The guy at the counter took his time to figure out the check-in offer and once we were able to open it, the coupon it's linked to is expired. We were super bummed, but he gave us 15% off our purchase to make up for it! Hooray!

Friendly employees and a great selection of products. Ex: I bought a bag of all natural sweet potato chips here for about a dollar less than Whole Foods. I looked for the same chips at another Safeway and they didn't have it! My husband also finds great deals on meat here. I'll send him to Safeway to get one thing and he comes back with two full bags of meat and the excuse "but babe, it was 50% off!" I also LOVE the Pub sandwich from the deli. Downside: not open 24 hours, but I still don't know of any in Arizona that are...

Love the taro yogurt and mochi balls! The only down side is the lack of seating and the fifty bajillion college kids that swarm this place. Maybe that's just the old woman in me, but this place gets really loud! I definitely like it here better than Mojo's so I'll take my yogurt to go and enjoy it in peace!

This buffet is pretty amazing. So amazing that we drive over 20 minutes and come with a game plan on how to eat more than 4 plates of food. Eastern buffet has all the basic chinese favorites plus sushi and a stir fry  station. Prices aren't bad and service is friendly. So bring your appetite and your stretchy pants and have a great time stuffing your face!

I am addicted to Stingray. The sushi here never fails and the happy hour is incredible. Maybe I'm a bit biased because all of my favorite rolls are on the HH menu, but shoot 2 people getting stuffed for under $20 is legit! Reading through other reviews I see that Stingray has lost a couple stars due to the service. I would say don't let that discourage you from coming in! I've experienced it myself... the only time I get amazing service is when my old roomie is working or when I go in to eat with her. But when she's not around I always find the hostess to be awkward and the servers to be very inattentive! One time our server never came to our table so we had to refill our water glasses with our son's baby water.... yeah pretty annoying, but i'll risk having a bad server for amazing sushi.

Best.Buffet.Ever.... I think those 3 words sum it up. Everything is delicious. I have never seen a selection of dessert so vast in my life. I come here with a game plan... start with cheese appetizers and end my meal with every dessert they have to offer. But my plan always fails. I can't start slow, this buffet is way too exciting. Totally worth the money and better than any buffet I've been to in Vegas. I'd come here every week if I was rich and had amazing metabolism.

I must be in love with Jimmy Woo because reading through all his bad reviews... I feel really bothered! Is there something wrong with me? I think this place is great! The first time I came here I was a bit hesitant while ordering.. I figured it would be pricey because it was in Scottsdale. When the food came out, I was happy to see big portions! We ordered 3 dishes for 2 people and ended up taking a lot of it home. The prices matched the amount and quality of the food.  I love how they have an option for brown rice with the dishes. I recommend the mongolian beef and kung pao vegetables! I think the food here is really good, and I never walk out of here feeling crappy and bloated like I do at other Chinese places. My only suggestion to the people running this place is to turn down the damn music. It's chinese food... chinese food can't be trendy!   OH also, I think they close at 10 now.

I really wanted to like it here. I've been wanting to go to a Tilted Kilt since I moved to Arizona because I love sports bars and I think the outfits on the girls are super cute. Well, what a big disappointment this place was!   The food was soooo nasty. I got a flatbread pizza that makes TV dinners seem amazing. My fiance got the ruben and it was bland and DISGUSTING. To top it off, our waitress was an idiot. Another waitress kept coming over and apologizing for her co-worker because she seemed more interested in chatting with the other girls than doing her job. My fiance was super annoyed, I had to calm him down during our dinner!   Also, minus a million stars for the horny old men slipping 20 dollar bills to the servers before even getting their bill. Um sir, that won't make her like you. Eww...

I'm so happy we found this place. The donut holes are amazing! Exactly how I like them! The iced coffee is great and I love the variety of syrups available. This place reminds me of the donut shops I grew up around in the bay area! We plan on being regulars here!

Total wine totally takes a crap on Bev Mo. This store has everything! The employees are also very knowledgeable. The other day we went in and my husband insisted I try red wine instead of sticking to my usual Riesling (I don't like change). So we asked one of the employees and he asked me a few questions then suggested a bottle of Malbec. The Malbec tasted amazing! I was so happy. For those of you who don't know, it's not only wine! You can find everything else. Total wine has helped us stock our bar and entertain our guests. Also, don't forget to chill your bottles before you leave!

I'm a big fan of Sports Authority. I love getting the 20% off coupons through the mail and email! In addition to the coupons, there seems to always be sales on workout clothes. My husband and I love stocking up on Under Armour and Nike dry shirts. I like this location because it's new and even though it's stocked with the same stuff as other locations, this location looks brighter and cleaner than the rest. Employees here are also really nice and helpful.

Came here for lunch with co-workers. I almost cried when I got the bill because I was still hungry, but found myself forking over $15 for one roll. I tried the cowboy and the surfer (i think?). I'm pretty sure the surfer is the one with a bunch of crap splattered all over it. Apparently, it's really popular. I felt like I was eating soup! Good place to go for people who are new to sushi. My manager, who is afraid of sushi, liked what he had.

Great place to get fast healthy food, but I do hate how all the bowls are the same price. We ordered the Toyko Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. The Tokyo Bay was worth the $10 because it was delicious, fulfilling, and had salmon. The Gulf of Mexico was just an overpriced Spinach salad and it was bland. My advice is to read the ingredients carefully and make sure you're getting your money's worth!

I don't get out much so when a friend suggested we have a girls night, I immediately thought about checking this place out. I'm a big country fan and the thought of dancing the night away to country music got me really excited. Unfortunately, this place sucked. It was a Friday night and it was crowded. The dance floor is SO SMALL!! What kind of country bar has a small dance floor?? We literally walked in, walked to the other side, then walked out. My friend perfectly described the atmosphere as a "college house party" where it's crowded, you don't really know anybody and you don't know what to do with yourself. All I saw were people standing tightly next to each other, holding a beer and making conversation. Ugh, I came here to dance!

My husband lined up the morning of the grand opening in hopes of getting a free couch (lol). He showed up 2 hours before they opened, but there were already so many people in front of him that he only got a coupon for $20 off an "accent piece". Apparently, Scottsdale doesn't play around when it comes to free stuff!  He was really bummed, but we showed up the next day because of an advertisement for a decent sized head board for $195.   Walking into the store, we were greeted by very friendly employees who offered us water, coffee or soda. One employee went out of his way to get a lollipop for my son! They have a kids play room with toys and a large TV. My son wanted to go into the play room, but being potty trained is a requirement so he was stuck with us. Every one was really friendly and really helpful, and they reminded us several times that they are not on commission so we shouldn't be afraid to ask questions.    As we looked at the head boards, we almost considered purchasing one that was more expensive, but the employee who helped us discouraged us from buying the more expensive one because that head board wasn't as strong as the other one, so she didn't recommend it for couples ( lol my husband and I had to contain our laughter!) and we appreciated her honesty!   We were blown away by the prices and the selection that we also purchased a large "L" couch for under $600 (that's cheaper than Ikea) and a large rug for the living room. They even let me use the $20 off for the rug even though it wasn't considered an "accent piece". Overall, it was a great experience and we feel so lucky that we were able to afford new furniture for our new home! We're a very young family who typically can't afford furniture unless it's from Ikea or Wal Mart. Thank you Living Spaces for giving us the opportunity to make our home beautiful!  OH and PS, in response to David L's review, we were warned about the fees! We were told if we return it or pick it up late, there will be fees! Just be a smart shopper and ask questions :)

I really hate writing long reviews, but it would be a disservice to give 2 stars and not give the entire story. If you had asked me 2 months ago how I felt about this gym, I would have said good things, but now I am not a fan! 5 stars for childcare staff, 1 star for management, so I'll settle for a 2 star review.   First off let me just rate the gym itself. Lot's of cardio machines and weight machines. Sometimes you have to wait for the free weights or other equipment. I think it would be nice if the trainers had their own equipment, but we just try to modify our workouts until the trainers are done with what we need. It's a small gym and not intimidating so it is an okay place to work out. Unfortunately, management is not the greatest and I've lost my motivation to work out in a place where I feel targeted and picked on.   We decided to sign up for this gym after getting advertisements in the mail every month for their $10 membership. The girl who helped us suggested that we get the $20 membership which included unlimited classes and the ability to bring in a guest every time you come in. Since I mentioned that I was not interested in going to the gym without my husband, she suggested that would be the best plan for us. $20 membership plus $10/month for child care, we started paying $30 month to month.   About a month ago when I went to sign in as a guest, a man at the desk (he was dressed like a manager) questioned me as I signed in. As I'm writing my name he looks at it and asks "you're a guest?" I said "um, yes". He asks " Who are you a guest of". I said "I'm a guest of my husband's, I come in with him". Then he asks me again and throws out a name and asks if I'm with him. I'm like what? I said I'm with my husband. I don't know if he was not listening or thought I was lying but he then asks "are you a member?" WTF man! Why the interrogation? I finally point at my husband and said "I'm here with him, is that okay??"   The next time I came into the gym, I notice that the guest sign in is no longer on the table and I get a weird vibe from the girl when I ask to sign in. Fast forward 2 weeks later, my husband gets a call from Smart Gym informing him that our membership is no longer valid and that I will need to sign up for my own membership. We go into the gym to talk to them and apparently the reason why our membership is not valid is due to the changes in their insurance so guests will not be covered if they get hurt. They were also not willing to accommodate us for the inconvenience, so we'd have to pay another $40 yearly maintenance fee, making it $80 for both of us. We were told we had a month to make a decision. We were in a pretty sour mood, so 30 minutes into our workout, the guy comes back up to us and tells us we now have 9 months to make a decision. That made us feel better and I figured we'd suck it up and just pay for another membership instead of looking for another gym.   So fast forward another week, my husband is talking to a guy he works with that goes to Smart Gym and turns out this guy has the exact same membership as us and never received a call about his membership being invalid. The only difference between him and us is that his guest doesn't come with him every time he works out. After hearing about our situation, my husband's co worker asked someone at Smart Gym if he would be forced to change his membership if there were any changes to anything and he was told, "no, you would be grandfathered in". UM, what????  After hearing about this, I no longer feel like setting foot in that gym. I love working out, but I'm willing to sit out the gym until we find another one. I just feel like we're being picked on and targeted, and I don't like being treated differently from other members just because we actually use the facility. One warning sign that Smart Gym was all BS was when we were told that the only way the child care door could be opened was with your fingerprint. Turns out the fingerprint thing is BS, anyone can open that door. You've been warned.  (sidenote: I wrote this review 5/9/14 and it never posted until today 7/10/16 so maybe the childcare door has changed, but I'd double check!)

I was planning on going to Kaleidoscope juice for my first juice cleanse, but saw the advertisement for the $39/day cleanse at Nekter during a trip to Jimmy Johns. I went in to ask some questions and I was helped by a very nice girl who said the deal ended on Saturday 2/15/14. On Friday, I saw via Facebook that the deal was extended to Sunday 2/16 and convinced my husband and a friend to do the cleanse with me on Sunday.   Today (Saturday) I went in to purchase 2 one day cleanses. Initially, as I walk in, I see several people waiting for their drinks and food, and I am waiting at an empty register while 3 people are in the back working on orders. After about a minute, one of the girls who seems very busy and stressed says she will be right with me. No biggie, I'm not in a rush. When she gets back to the register, I order 2 one day cleanses and the stressed out girl comes off as a little rude. She says, "well the deal ends today, so are you going to do the cleanses today?" In my head I thought, on Facebook it says it ends Sunday, and why would I have to do the cleanse today when the juices are good for a couple days? I didn't quite get it, and I didn't think she was very friendly so I just said "yes".   When I got home, I showed my husband the juices and we planned on starting the cleanse the following day. On the label of the juices, it says to consume the juice within 5 days of purchase, but as we inspect the bottles, half of the bottles have an expiration date of 5 days from today (2/20/14) and half have an expiration date of TODAY (2/15/14). Because we are concerned about getting sick from these juices, we decided to do the cleanse today even though we were not quite ready.  I give 2 stars because my first impression was not a good one, but I am willing to go back and try the smoothies because they are cheaper than other juice bars in the area. BUT I will not recommend this place to anyone unless my next experience is a good one. My suggestion to Nekter is to make sure they have enough people working on a Saturday so that the workers are not stressed and can be friendly at all times. I also suggest that they are consistent with the deals/advertisements they have on social media, and to make sure they're not giving old juices while telling people they can start the cleanse a few days after purchasing it.  _______________________________________________________________ *******UPDATE: My husband posted on Nekter's facebook about the bottles having different expiration dates and they said "we apologize as all bottles should expire the same day - we would be glad to give you new bottles to compliment the others. thank you!"  SO my husband goes to exchange the expired bottles, the girl he talked to did not want to help him and said that the cleanse is supposed to be completed the day of purchase (although their website says different) and that is why the bottles expired that same day. He tells her that he was told that all of the bottles should have the same expiration date and she says "well you must have spoken to someone in California because we do things differently in Arizona". Really?! After going back and forth, she finally gives in.  I would have given them an extra star for fixing the problem right away, but it was such a frustrating experience, that I've decided to take one off. We will not be returning.  P.S. Tim G. I'm not complaining about a short shelf life. Read my review and do your research ;) thanks!
