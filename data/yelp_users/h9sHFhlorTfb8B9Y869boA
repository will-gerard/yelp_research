This has to be the worst company around!  I have had to have them pick up a vehicle twice in the last 2 months.( two different cars with different issues)  I guess this is the company through my insurance ? The first time the guy was 30 minutes late and proceeded to be extremely rude upon arrival because he wasn't having to do what he was expecting ? ( he also smelled like booze)  today when my vehicle stalled out on the side of the freeway i was told they would arrive in 1 hour.  Two hours later after my third call I'm told he must have missed the call to get me and should be here in ABOUT 20 minutes.  When I voiced my frustration the lady on the phones only idea was to MAYBE give me a discount if my car breaks down again!  Horrible.
