I didn't really enjoy waiting in such a long line to order and pay for my food. I wouldn't recommend going here if you're absolutely starving. If you've never been before, it's not the type of place where you walk in and get seated by a host or hostess. You walk in, grab a menu, and wait in a line until you reach the register. The part that I do like is that you can see the food being made in front of you and everything looked so good, I sort of needed the additional time to choose from all the options. I felt bad for my boyfriend because he definitely didn't expect to wait as long as we did and he looked like he was going to pass out from starvation. We hadn't eaten breakfast and it was going on lunch time. Once you pay at the resister, you can finally sit at a table, but I think the employees purposely slow the line down because they can't seat people until tables open up. We actually ordered an Oatmeal Cream Pie since we saw it in the pastry window by the register and assumed they would give it to us right away. After all, I was afraid my boyfriend was about to pass out. Unfortunately, they brought it out with the rest of the food so it was kind of a waste, but luckily it was still pretty tasty.  I decided to try the Red Bean and Rice Burger (red bean and rice patty, Cajun spices, Monterey Jack, red onion, shredded iceberg, grilled sesame roll, and dip trio). I liked the burger, but I got sick of it after a while. I think the patty is too basic and could use some vegetables or something. My boyfriend ordered from the breakfast menu even though it was after 1 pm. If you're able to grab a breakfast menu at the front and you end up getting stuck in like till after 1 pm like we did, they'll still make you breakfast which is really nice. He ordered the Smothered Breakfast Burrito (eggs, grilled chicken breast, cheddar cheese, salsa casera, Liberty potatoes, flour tortilla, smothered with tomatillo and chile pequin sauce) and it was really delicious. I actually liked his meal way better than mine even though I'm usually a big fan of vegetarian burgers. Additionally, I tried the Mojito and thought it was pretty refreshing.   I would definitely give this place another shot, but I wouldn't necessarily jump at the chance to either (mainly because of the line situation). On the other hand, some of the Yelp pictures for this restaurant look pretty enticing and I love that everything is really fresh, so it's possible I could change my mind. Their Sicilian style pizzas look pretty good and would likely be the next item on my list of things to try if I decided to go back again.

One of the best nights out I have ever had in Las Vegas. We did this for my boyfriend's 35th birthday and had such a great time that we're going to do it again for my birthday. The limo driver was 10 minutes early and was very flexible about whatever we wanted to do for the night.

Nice timeshares, but these people are completely full of it. My boyfriend and I stayed here because we came across one of those Bluegreen booths at the Carlsbad Outlet center that were supposedly giving a "free" cruise. Rule of thumb, if it sounds too good to be true, it is. They told us all we had to do was stay at their resort for a weekend and attend the timeshare meeting. We asked multiple times if there was a catch. When we asked if there was a catch, that's when they should have told us that the cruise wasn't free! You have to pay for all of the BS fees including gas which comes out to be around $200. Sorry, but just because you make my cruise slightly cheaper does not make it FREE! On top of it, the sales people at the presentation were complete idiots, lying through their teeth left and right. Not that I planned on buying a timeshare, but I feel bad for the people who believe their lies. I will never stay at Bluegreen resort again.

Pros: *People are nice. *Complementary water bottles. *Large room. *Decent sized refrigerator. *Rustic look. *Apartment-like layout. *Back patio. *Close to downtown Scottsdale.  Cons: *If you're from out of town and don't have a car, be prepared to hike to your room (luckily we had a car). *Unnecessary resort fee.  *Rooms are old. The bathrooms could use a tile upgrade and new shower curtains. The curtains have rips and don't appear to be very clean. *There were big clumps of dust under the bed and behind the TV. *Couldn't open the curtains to let light into the room because they were dirty - had flies and mold on them. *There was a random razor under the chair. *Old, small, box television set.    Additional Comments: Do not pay full price on their website. I cannot believe they charge over $100 per room, per night. I'm please we got a great deal on Hotwire, but I'm not happy to see that many people have experienced bugs (even cockroaches-yuck). We didn't experience cockroaches (as far as I know) but based on the cleanliness of the rooms, I could totally see how this would be possible. If you're just there to sleep and shower, it's an okay place to stay. If you're a little squeamish about things being dirty or having to deal with potential bugs, I would stay somewhere else. On the 2nd night, we forgot to unlock out door for the cleaning service to come in so we had to make a call at midnight for a sheet change. They were quick, but the guy helping us couldn't find the correct sheet size/type for our bed and just gave us a random one to cover the top. The sheets were falling apart all night. I find it odd that they couldn't find even ONE clean sheet, the correct size, to supply us with.

It wasn't prime time when I came here, but the service was on point, and the employees were friendly. Frankly, I was just happy to finally find a Starbucks on my way home to San Diego. It seems like on I-10, leaving Phoenix, Starbucks are few and far between so if you see one and miss it, turn around! Otherwise, you'll be stuck driving through hours of nothingness until you get to Gila Bend (but Gila Bend doesn't even have a Starbucks)! Such a huge mistake considering all the travelers that pass through there, but I digress. Spotting this location made my day!

I just did the Sky Jump over the weekend for my birthday and it was everything I expected it to be!  Due to bad weather the previous day resulting in closure of the Sky Jump, there were a lot of walk-ins and re-scheduled appointments, so be smart and make an appointment in advance. Since I had big birthday plans that night, I had very limited time. After speaking with several employees (multiple times), I finally pushed my way into a 6pm time slot vs. two other options, 7:45pm and midnight. I thought it was cool of them to find a way to squeeze me in and more importantly, make me feel safe. I'm extremely afraid of heights but this is something I really wanted to conquer in hopes of building my way up to sky diving. They checked the harness 3 times and did numerous checks after hooking me up to the cable. In addition, almost all of the employees have done the jump many times and talk to you about it, which is a big relief too. If you're scared to do something like this but want to, I would highly recommend starting with the Sky Jump! In my case, there were other nervous people at the top waiting in line that I could relate with before leaping off the platform! It's a tad bit expensive, but an experience I'll never forget.   Recommendation: My friends and family said it would be nice to have heat lamps outside for people watching the jumpers. I guess they were pretty cold while they were waiting for me!

I'm surprised that the ratings for this particular location aren't higher. I've been to several Einstein Bros Bagels that don't seem to have a good system in place. It's not that the food isn't good. it's just that the service tends to be slow or the orders get messed up (at least from my many experiences). When I came here one morning after a long night of partying in Vegas, I had a little too much to drink the night before so I really needed some bread to absorb all the alcohol still sitting in my stomach. So, my boyfriend and I ordered some food here and didn't have to wait in line very long and guess what?! The food was ready within minutes and one of the employees even brought our food to our table. I know it sounds so simple, but wow if I had a nickel for all the Einstein mistakes I've dealt with... I try to be fair because mistakes DO happen, but after a while you just start to wonder what's so hard about toasting a bagel and slapping on some cream cheese?! This location knows what's up.

Very similar to Benihana, where you can sit at a table with other people and have a chef cook in front of you, teppanyaki style. You also have the option to sit at the sushi bar or a standard table with your own party, without a chef. We sat at a table since we were not ordering off the teppanyaki menu.  My boyfriend and I shared the BBQ Salmon Roll, the Golden California Roll, and the Boston Roll. All three were quite appetizing, but my favorite was the BBQ Salmon Roll. It's basically just a Crunchy California Roll with crab mix and salmon, baked in lava sauce. Not really sure what lava sauce is (my guess would be Sriracha, mayo, and some other jazz), but it looked like lava!   The service was fast, though we did eat on the later side so I'm not sure how it is regularly. Either way, I'm a fan of their food and affordable prices. I'm glad this place is located near my friend's house in AZ as I would definitely request this restaurant again next time I'm in town.

I was told by my Arizona friends that this place is currently ranked the best new craft brewery in America. Being from San Diego, where the craft brewing scene is huge, I have pretty high standards. That being said, this place definitely met my expectations.   I decided to order tasters of everything and here some of the things worth mentioning:  * If you enjoy the hops as much as I do, go for the Refuge IPA. It was perfectly hoppy, which made it my favorite beer of the night.  * Another great choice is the Suit-n-tIePA (double IPA). It's weird that it's not quite as hoppy as the Refuge IPA, but no doubt still an excellent beer. It's hard to believe it 8.2% alcohol considering how smooth it is. * I'm not a fan of sour beers, but I know some people are. I tried the BW Berliner Weisse and Sour in the Redfield and they were just not good in my opinion.  * The Signal Mountain Stout surprised me. I am not big on stouts, but it was good because it's not too heavy and you can actually taste the cacoa in it.   I also ordered the Hawaiian Wilderness burger (Brisket Blend Burger, Pepper Jack Cheese, Beeriyaki Grilled Pineapple, Beer-Braised Onions, Sweet 'N' Spicy (Brioche)) and it was very good. I would consider myself a harsh burger critic, so I do have a few comments. The meat was a TINY bit overcooked, but the middle of the burger was good. I ordered the Sweet 'N' Spicy sauce on the side since the waitress told me it would be more on the spicy side. I still gave it a try, but I wasn't a fan since I'm not really into spicy food. My friend on the other hand, ordered the same thing and really enjoyed the sauce so it really just depends on what you prefer. My favorite part of the burger was the Beer-Braised Onions. I could eat those every day!    Overall, I really enjoyed this brewery a lot. When it comes to beer, they have something for everyone (and they are inexpensive too). The food is mostly burgers but there are a few other options if you're not into that (I really want to try the Bavarian Pretzel Sticks sometime). Go early because they get VERY busy and the wait can be long. OR, you can go around 8 pm like we did when the dinner rush is over. We still had to wait 15-20 minutes to get seated but we just stood in the bar area and started trying beers. If you go around 6-7 pm, I hear the wait can be an hour or longer!

My group and I went here 10 minutes before they were about to switch over from breakfast to lunch. I was a little thrown off when the employee who was taking orders at the front of the restaurant told us we would have to choose between breakfast and lunch and we all had to make the same decision. Apparently they sanitize the grill when they make the switch but I guess I've never experienced this before. Why couldn't those who wanted breakfast order and then those who wanted lunch order 10 minutes later?  Anyway, we all chose breakfast.  My boyfriend and I ordered the Eggs Florentine (poached eggs, broiled tomatoes, sautéed spinach, and grilled ham, layered on an English muffin and topped with hollandaise sauce paired with rosemary grilled potatoes) without broiled tomatoes. When the food came out, there were no broiled tomatoes, which was good, but they forgot to give both of us the grilled ham and unfortunately I didn't realize it until the end of the meal. I brought it up to the people I was with but they didn't agree that the dish was supposed to include ham. So, I just checked the menu right now and saw that I was right. In addition, I did not enjoy the sautéed spinach so I took it off, leaving only a poached egg on top of an English muffin. The egg was overcooked too and there wasn't much hollandaise sauce on top. The rosemary potatoes were cold so I didn't enjoy those either. I did however try my friend's Lemon Blueberry Pancakes topped with buttermilk syrup and berries and that was very good. I like that the portions are small, but it's a bit on the expensive side considering the portions aren't as large as most restaurants. The staff was nice but they seemed inexperienced.

I was in Scottsdale attending the Super Bowl Fan Fest when I randomly found this bar after parking near it. It was packed with mostly Seahawks fans, probably because admission was free if you were wearing something Seahawks related. The Patriots fans had their own designated bar down the street that was near empty.   The rapper, Too $hort was hanging out in VIP with his crew and was scheduled to perform that night. We really wanted to stick around but had dinner plans with friends. We also didn't want to start drinking and get too crazy since we had a long night ahead of us. Cool place though. Definitely the type of bar for big groups. For the most part, the bar was filled with intoxicated people, socializing and/or dancing, all before 6 pm. It was a crazy, high energy environment, but that could just be because of all the fans in town for the Super Bowl.

Why don't we have one of these in San Diego?!  I came here with some friends when I was in town and I'll admit that I was skeptical at first. I'm not a golfer AT ALL but, I had a really great time! The nice thing is that you don't have to be good at golfing to do well here. I was the least experienced golfer in my group and I didn't even get last place. If you can hit your ball into 1 of the 11 targets (ranging from 20 to 240 yards), you'll get points, which will automatically show up on a screen at your table so you don't have to keep track manually. The concept is a lot like bowling, but it's a driving range. It might seem a little expensive, but it really isn't if everyone playing chips in.   Another great feature this place has to offer is the bar. More than likely, there will be a wait to play golf because this place is so popular but, you can go hang out in the bar and eat/drink while you wait. It's no different than going to any other bar just to hang out. The atmosphere is really fun and energetic (all of the employees are always dancing and being goofy) so I would probably hang out there even if there wasn't a wait to play golf. Before you know it, it'll be your turn to hit some balls and the fun will continue!
