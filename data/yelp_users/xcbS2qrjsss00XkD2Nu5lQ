This is a very nice target. It is clean, inviting, and the staff is very nice and helpful. I do a lot of shopping here based on the cleanliness and atmosphere. I would recommend this target to anyone looking for a nice place to shop.

I was going to give this place a good review. The service was good, the food came out fast (we went through the drive thru), and the price isn't too bad. But half way through the meal my wife found a wire mesh (like the ones on the faucet in a bathroom sink) in her tostada salad. Not only is this level of neglect dangerous, it is just gross. What if that had been in a child's food? I don't think we will ever be eating there again.

My wife and I went into get the meal and they gave us a very hard time about it. We decided to dine in this time, and sadly more than half of the tables are dirty, both trash cans are overflowing, and the salsa bar is half empty. On top of all that they messed up my wife's meal replacement and gave her the wrong thing. The worst part about this is that they aren't even busy. This is a case of pure laziness. Very disappointing.

I am not kidding when I tell you, this place has the best doughnuts I have ever had! They are extremely fresh, soft, and moist. They have very good prices and a nice staff. If you need to stop for doughnuts before work this is your place....pick up a dozen and impress everyone at work!

This place has a very nice patio. That being said their service is not that great. I may have seen my server twice the whole time I was there. There was a huge fan right behind my wife and I that was very loud making it hard to carry on a conversation. Their salsa is way too hot for me (it is very fresh though). The food is okay at best. I probably won't go there again due to the service.

Great little Mexican place. The interior is very nice and updated. They have the best tortillas around and the prices are very good. If you haven't been here you should definitely check it out.

Maybe it's just me but this store is not up to par in my opinion. I always stop here to get money orders for rent on the way home from work and I almost always have to wait at the counter for 5 or more minutes while employees constantly yell "someone will be right with you" at me from all directions. The sandwich counter is good although it says sandwich in 3 minutes or its free and it always takes longer. (I never say anything because I don't care, I just don't see the point of the sign.) Their meat section is a joke lacking any real selection. The produce is almost always below my quality standards and is also lacking in selection. Last but most definitely not least they always have just one register open and no self checkout. Overall going there is a highly inconveniencing experience and I would not recommend going there for anything.

This is one of the cleanest most organized gas stations I have been to in a long time. The cashiers are fast and friendly. They have really good on the go style breakfast sandwiches. Definitely gonna stop there when I can.

Great bar! Great staff! Definitely my favorite place to get drinks with friends and play pool. Awesome happy hour prices and the bartenders are very good. The crispy chicken salad is to die for. They also have an Internet jukebox making it very easy to create your own environment with your own music.

This place is just ok. My wife and I went there and both got beef brisket sandwiches and they were not that good. The bread was hard and the meat was dry. I got Mac and cheese on the side and it was good but hardly any reason to go there. It was way overpriced for the food quality.

Just ate there today and I have say they have good food. I had the ham and Swiss sandwich and it was great. Friendly staff, and very clean inside. The only thing is the side of potato salad I got with my sandwich was about 2 bites, very tasty but I wish they would give more. All in all it was a good experience and I will definitely be back.

I have eaten here many times and they do not disappoint. Their breakfast burritos are very good and the sauce they give you is amazing. I have eaten over half the items on the menu and it is great every time. The staff is friendly and it is very clean. Definitely a food staple of the the area.

This store is far superior to frys. Their product quality is always on point and it is never crowded. The best thing about them is that they have the best pizza in maricopa...easily, and it is affordable. Say whatever you want about the slight price difference on some items, it's worth it to get quality. They have great staff that are always willing to help and are friendly.

This place is a go to for late night food. Always clean and the food is quality. I gave them four stars because the staff could seem a little happier. They are always in a bad mood and it almost makes you feel bad for going in to order food.

This is the worst walmart I've ever been in. The parking lot is full of trash, there are employees out front smoking, nothing is ever stocked, the lines are always super long (especially at customer service), employees never have answers to your questions, and it's just dirty in general inside. I could list off more but it would take forever. The only reason I would go there is to get something late night when nothing else is open, but now that they close at midnight I have no reason to go there. I would recommend staying away from this walmart entirely.

I love this place. I've eaten here 4 times now and it is very good every time. They have a huge selection of drinks and a crazy amount of things to put on hot dogs. I love the family feel in this place. Definitely the best place to stop for lunch for a hot dog.

Usually I love jimmy johns but this one has something just a bit off about it. The customer service is ok at best, the people that make the sandwiches are very slow (compared to other jimmy johns I've been to), and the sandwiches aren't as good as the sandwiches from other locations. I won't be going there anymore.
