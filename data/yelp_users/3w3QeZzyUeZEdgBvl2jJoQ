I am extremely pleased with Preventive Pest Control. Preston called me last week to set up day and time that works best with our busy schedule.  He was great with answering my questions and any concerns I had. We got the confirmation phone call day before scheduled day of service.  On day of scheduled service, Our tech Patrick called to advise ETA . He was Very informative and knowledgeable upon arrival. Did I mention his excellent customer service skills ?  He was Very Polite and personable.  He makes you feel like your the most important customer.  We really enjoyed talking with him.  He treated the pest problem and explained the time frame to expect results. Patrick was also very careful with spraying  around our cats and their food/water bowls also.  I highly Recommend Preventive Pest Control!

I'm only giving this review 1 Star because the system won't post without a star. Where do I begin?.. I switched to Homelife Protection home warranty last Sept 2012 since my other Warranty co price was going to increase sharply and previous service call experiences were unsatisfactory. Today I called Homelife to get service ASAP due to Water heater not working since Saturday. I even submitted a claim online. Never recieved an email reply showing recieved and being handled ASAP. Called Monday morning and was advised they would have someone call me shortly and explained it may cost me an additional $850.00 for replacement of water heater if has to be replaced. Now in the details of what is covered it states they cover up to $500. for water heaters. I had already priced water heaters at 2 different places and found them priced from aprox $218.00 and up.  The warranty co had advised the installation and additional parts needed are not included and i would also still need to pay the $45.00 service call. I advised I had read that they can opt to pay us the $ instead for the replacement. Now this is where it gets interesting. The warranty advisor checked our acct and stated there had been NO Payments since Oct 2012.  I advised that's impossible since I was set up on Auto draft since acct set up last Sept 2012. I looked at my checking acct on line all the way back to Oct and found yes indeed that was last payment they drafted. How I hadn't noticed ..not sure. I asked why they had stopped drafting my acct and they claimed there was a "general error code" and it effected not just me. I asked why didn't they contact me via phone and or email. They claimed they did try to call me. But somehow they had wrong phone # when I asked them to verify # they had been calling. I asked why they didn't email me then? They claimed "we don't do that" then why do they keep my email on file in the 1st place? Hmmmmm. But they  were prompt to state they could take 2 months payment over the phone right then to resolve the issue. I told them NO Thanks! You've already shown your Incompetence as a Company and I will No Longer be doing business with them!  Needless to say I got a Brand New Water heater for just $259.00 today from an appliance store and my husband installed it per instructions. So the moral of the story is: A Home Warranty is Worthless and will cost you more $$ in 99% of the cases!..Especially one like HomeLife.

I emailed Steve late Tuesday night requesting an oil change for our business truck. He promptly called me Wednesday morning and set us up for Wednesday afternoon. We had a customer quote scheduled at that same time he was scheduled to arrive, So we weren't going to be able to be there. But that's the Great thing about Onsite Mobile Oil Change. They come to You where ever you are. Who has time to wait 30-60 min in a Brick and Mortar Oil lube shop? We surely don't! Especially being business owners ourselves. Steve did an Awsome Job!!  He even changed out our worn out windshield wipers. I feel much more confident and safe with his service then if we had taken our vehicle to the dealership or any other facility where you are only a number not an important customer! Believe me, we've had plenty of bad experiences with those "other" Lube/oil change places. We Won't use Any Other Oil Change company now that we found Onsite Oil Change!!!!

We have a home that was built in 89 and starting to really see time taking its toll on the house with needed repairs and replacing appliances in general including the Garage Door. Wednesday Aug 21st, our garage door spring broke. We called Triple B Garage doors because we like to support local small business and have run into Rusty and his family shopping in a local neighborhood grocery store in the past and got to know him better. We felt from our coversations Rusty and Roderick to be down to earth and trustworthy people. Rusty and his son came to our home promptly Thursday morning Aug 22 and fixed our spring. He oiled our rollers and gave his recommendations for other areas of concern he found while fixing our spring. He didn't pressure us or try to have us pay for services we didn't need. We are Very impressed and Happy with Triple B Garage Doors service and expertise.  I am excited to Tell Everyone and Recommend this company!

My husband and I went to visit our daughter ( which I am sorry to say is far and few between due to our very hectic schedule) and grandbaby today at her apt. We parked in a guest parking spot and backed in. Unfortunately we didn't see sign at front entrance until leaving in our daughters vehicle much later due to our vehicle being towed. We were only parked maybe 2 1/2 hrs there before needing to leave. These signs the apt complex claim they have posted all over the apt complex are not very prominent and "visitors" would not even take in consideration that the signs applies to them. We called the tow company and advised we want our vehicle brought back Immediately. The driver  "Sam " rudely said no, and we can pick up tomorrow morning for $155.00. My daughter called them and asked if we can pick up tonight, they advised not until after 9pm because no one is there at the sight. Make Note that She called them at 6:35 pm. They advised it will be $20.00 cheaper tomorrow morning. They supposidely open from 10:00 am-4:00 pm...very odd hrs for a tow company. Our daughter looked at her lease agreement to see if it even advises backing in is not allowed and read the parking policies small paragraph to us.  And I quote " abandoned or unauthorized vehicles will be towed away at owners expense After a 24 hr notice is posted on vehicle. The 24 hr notice does not apply to vehicles parked in space assigned to another resident, parked in a tow away zone or parked to impede traffic. Vehicles so parked will be towed away Immediatly" interesting how our parked vehicle did not fit into this category but we didn't get the curtesy 24 hr notice. Therefor they violated the parking policy that they set . Also, note it DOES NOT state in the parking policy Anything about vehicles that are backed in.   We will be contacting our attorney and Any necessary media to get this resolved, make an example of their contradictory rules and show Mission Springs apts they will be Very Sorry for treating tenants and visitors so poorly. The Towing company will be regretting their actions as well especially if my vehicle is damaged in Any Way!!  Our daughter has had numerous problems living at this apt complex also.  Anyone looking to rent here...head our advise DO NOT RENT AN APT AT MISSION SPRINGS APTS!!!  I'm only giving 1 star because I have to just to get this review to post.

Our daughter finally moved out of this dump of an apartment at Mission Springs.  Since she had an extremely busy work schedule the week of moving, her father and I cleaned her apt so she would get her deposit back.  She scheduled her walk thru for a day and time and David took it upon himself to walk thru Before she arrived. He wrote her up /charged on several items that are totally bogus. Such as "painting ", full clean , carpet replacement, cabinet boxes needing re painting, pet damage to carpet.  He refused to let her in the apt to do walk thru with him and get pictures of what he is charging her for.  Luckily we took before and after pictures when we did the cleaning. She had lived in the apt 3.5 years. They Neglected her apt repair request thru out her lease. On 1 occasion they told her they were going to replace her carpet but David informs her that person no longer works there and they are charging for new carpet.  Her carpet wasn't new when she moved in 2010.  Apt carpet is supposed to be replaced at 5 year mark when tenant leaves.  Painting is part of the make ready process for every vacant apt. She never had an animal in her apt, so they better rethink that bogus lie about  pet stains. Just because there is mold stains on caulking of tub, doesn't constitute a full clean charge.  Go ahead and TRY to  charge her for these bogus charges. We will see you in Court Mission Springs apts!!  BTW MISSION SPRINGS...We've already consulted with an Attorney about this.  Not looking to promising for you guys.    TO ANYONE CONSIDERING MOVING INTO MISSION SPRINGS APTS....1311  W  Baseline rd. Tempe, Az. DON'T  move in. You Will regret it!!!!  They have very poor customer service, they don't take care of the apts or there tenants.

We called on 2u tire for a problem tire that goes flat frequently on our business trailer.  Graham was prompt and very professional at our home. He assessed all of our tires to make sure they were in good condition. He advised his findings on another tire needing immediate attention. We opted to replace both tires immediately. Graham's prices were very reasonable and his knowledge superior. We didn't feel like he was trying to switch and bait to make extra $$.  During our closing conversation, the subject came up that our personal vehicle tires are registering low air. Graham offered to look at the tires. He tested the tire pressure on all 4 tires including the spare and aired up the tires to the proper tire pressure. He didn't even charge us.  We Highly recommend 2uTire for All your tire needs. Graham can also balance and  rotate tires for you.  Don't waste half your day at a tire store. Have 2UTire come to You!!
