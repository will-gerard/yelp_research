I have been to many different pharmacies and decided to try Target a year ago! I am so HAPPY I made the switch! Not only are meds cheaper, but they also have a rewards program that after every 5th fill you get 5% off the whole day at target! The MAJOR reason I switched permanently was because the pharmacists are some of the friendliest I have ever encountered! They take their time always answer ANY questions and are super fast!

If you really want to have an amazing hair experience, then visit this Salon. My husband and I are both clients of Gigi, and it truly a one of a kind service. I have sent her many of my friends, because she had this uncanny ability to look at you and "just know" what will work for you. She is honest and caring, and you never have to worry about not looking amazing after you leave. I trust her completely with my hair, so much so that, I just go in sit down and don't even have to say what I want.  The Salon is so beautiful on the inside and the staff is so friendly. I came in and sat down and not 30 seconds later did someone ask if I wanted something to drink. This happened with every client that came in. The inside is very clean and has a great atmosphere about it. While you are waiting, you can look at all the merchandise they have, which ranges from hair care to clips and more! Seriously visit this SALON!

I have been going here for years, and I must say that the staff and Dr. Webb are some of the best I have ever encountered! They have always been nice and try to get me in even on short notice! I had a less than easy pregnancy and every one of them was so helpful! Dr. Webb always took his time and listened to my concerns and went over any questions I had, same goes for his nurse Amy! I won't trust anyone else with delivering my future children except for Dr. Webb and his team!

Super nice guys that worked there! Super patient with their customers! Usually you feel rushed and awkward, but the two guys working when I was there just now were awesome!

Backyard Dream Builders and Stewart are a dream come true for people that are looking to do heavy or light construction on their home. I am positive that everyone has worked with a contractor that you were less than happy with, but that could not be further from the truth when working with Stewart! We have had out fair share of people that were not on time, didn't show up, or took total advantage of us, and I will NEVER use anyone else again besides Steward and his crew. The work that we had done on our backyard was FANTASTIC and everyone else that sees it agrees! Stewart is not only at the site everyday, and works to get the job done to perfection, but he is always early and ALWAYS keeps everyone in the loop. We are using him for a couple other projects and can't wait to see how those turn out!

I have been calling Steve for almost two years now. My carpet was pretty old and needed constant upkeep! I would call Steve a couple times a year to clean it and it looked amazing!! We have two dogs and kids, so you can imagine the wear and tear it was getting! He got it looking as close to new as it could! He also cleaned my moms tile and carpet in her townhouse! He is super on time and very accommodating with his schedule!! Great job!!

I had my iPhone 6 screen replaced here, and I should have just driven to the Apple Store. It's more expensive than the Apple store (about $50) and also they did a horrible job. The screen is lifting from the phone now and you can see inside the housing. I am just waiting till the new phone comes off but you can clearly see the gap. When I dropped it off I also let them know to put on a glass protector, so good thing I double checked when I got my phone back because they charged me for it but had not put it on. When I mentioned something the guy seemed annoyed when I asked how long I would have to wait...
