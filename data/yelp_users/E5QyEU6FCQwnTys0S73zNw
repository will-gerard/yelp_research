i use to go by here every day of the week and never knew this place was open. the parking lot always empty. in fact i've had several people i trust tell me how great this place was..and i never realized..THIS was the place they were talking about. gasp.   so i came her with my BFF's family for fathers day. it was pretty damn good. after a very long wait and eventual long walk to the rear dining room we got seated. chips pretty tasty, sales pretty spicy. food was delish..i got carnitas and they were big porky chunks of awesomeness. they gave me large tortillas..which was ok cause i just tore off pieces to pick up meat. my one complaint...it reminded me of my highschool cafeteria. Jaguar Pride What!! anyways..the vast openess and still confined spacing of the restaurant. if there was a fire breakout..i don't think anyone would make it out alive tho. :(  carnitas were bombdigity yaheard!! get on it.   price is affordable, and the menu distinctly not, run of the mill "mexican food"

Hands down the best teryaki in the world.  i'm really not exagerating. this place is awesome. i have been going to blue fin off an on for the past 20 years. i remember as a child going to florance crittenden after getting a teriyaki bowl with half a salad. every chance i get i drop by this place.   the teriyaki bowls are serious. not skimping on portions at all. and if you seriously off a diet, they have double meat portions. :D    i like the dark meat chicken version. drop on a heavy sprinkling of the hot powder and some black sesame seeds. OMG!!! the best in the world.  the Panko chicken is my second favorite dish. the egg rolls are great.   the owners are always great, cheerful and ready to chat you up. i was so glad to hear this place was spared the wreaking ball. i would have chained myself to the door if it came to it. inside is cute and hasn't changed..in forever. i am serious. ever.  getting to it is tricky now. and parking is just as tricky. but its worth it. SOOOO WORTH IT

OMG NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!  like Grand Master Flash said about the white lines "Don't Do It" Rang dang diggedy dang di-dang  Diggedy dang di-dang diggedy dang di-dang  my Torta Burro had no flava-dang, i was sad panda mang  this business has been in operation too long and clearly the owners (i doubt the original owners) stopped giving a shit. if they did the average rating wouldn't be 2.5 stars. i remember this place as a kid, i don't remember ever eating here. so i really cannot comment on how great it was. but like Sing High, the downtown nostalgia restaurants are extremely scary. just avoid this...it's not good. my plate looked sad, just a naked burro with a side of hashbrowns that were hardly crispy anywhere. the salsa was tasty, but i would hardly add a star to it. the service was compitant, but i couldn't understand her. i couldn't blame my ADD on it. my friend liked the menudo, but i wouldn't make that a saving grace for this place. cool logo on the building. very retro..but do not be fooled by it.

Wow, this is exactly what the downtown area needs more of. considering our nightlife is catatonic. a live venue is the only spark of civilization during the week nights. the area can be sketch..but usually during the day. you are spiting distance from the sheriffs office so it kinda gives a sense of security.  the look and feel to the place is classic old. seating is available for the loungers. a couple round booths and some stand up tables. stage is big enough to hold antedote, living legends, and hiero...so basically figure it's a large stage.   beer selection is good. and they mix drinks too. I've had friends complain they are weak..but i usually roll with hardcore drunks...so go figure them being weak.  the acoustics are OK. some problems have occurred while i was there. but i am never phased by that. I've been to scrappy's and the Nile. so I'm kinda used to it.

this place is really huge. you get the idea its big from its above ground footprint...but the above ground is dwarfed by the underground halls.  it's massive.  i loved everything but the cactus sand sculpture that look more like butter then they do sand.

Seriously? seriously?  i find nothing appealing about this place.   themed restaurants are for the lamez of the world. they do have some bangin hot chicks working here. but nothing to get myself worked up about. next it will be McFarland's and it will become a lame comic themed bar. or worse. why do our local celebs blow?

oh alas my Athenian Express our relationship was cut short by your niche ours of operations. as you see my dear. i only live downtown. so our short lived affair can only be just that. short. your Gyro Picado was tasty and you carried the heat that i enjoy in my relationships. the 4lbs of french fries were lovely, crisp, but waaaay too many. i truly appreciate your abundant portions, but i do not feel a need to gorge myself on your bounty.  ok lame love poems aside. this place is a great little greekish noshery. the patty melt my friend got looked awesome, we can more or less confirm the pre-formed patty observed by another yelper. but it was still grilled to perfection, sporting American cheese as by friend likes it was also a gold star.  she works in spitting distance to this place. unfortunately i work in Tempe. i was off on PTO today so figured would get lunch together. oddly enough another good friend was having lunch there too...great minds think alike they say..i concur.  atmosphere is typical sit down with some Chicago sport memorabilia on the side. GO CUBBIES!!! i would certainly be here more...if not for the hours of operation.  this downtown area needs to pick up on the weekends so places like this will have a reason to be open on the weekenders. alas..i don't' think that will happen anytime soon. till then Athenian. i love your lunch.

i think the arizona science center is pretty cool.  i've only been here a few times...and unless something really really cool is going on..i will not make it a point to come back often. but it's cool factor is high enough to give it 4 stars instead of just give it 3.   this place is seriously allot better with a beer in your hand. trust me.

so two gringos walk into a mexican taco shop next to a mexican bus station....  badump bump.   OMG!! wtf have i been missing here. i got a carne asada burro and a soft chicken taco...  taco was awesome. the corn tortilla was soft, supple and tasted awesome. piled high with lettuce some sliced radish and i squeezed some lemon ontop. i murdered this taco. execution style. imagine finding a duffle bag full of heads in Juarez...well this taco belonged to one of those heads..understand?  the burro was very tasty. the meat seasoned well and only two bites did i find some grisly bits. the carne asada was rolled up with some diced tomatoes and a cup of pico on the side.   i kinda prefer my CA Burrito with a heap of Guacamole like how FilliB's makes them. but this was really tasty and i will order it again...after i check out the other items on the menu of course.   you will now find me here every saturday morning.  the tacos at Tacos De Juarez will soon refer to me as the Chalupacabre.

Hanny! this was my place. i was here like clockwork every other friday, and every other saturday. i would also stop in randomly on the other 6 days of the week.  i have history here, some good, some bad. i stopped in here last week on a whim, i saw some friends i hadn't seen in a while so i figured go in and have "1" drink. well after my 4th beer and a vodka shot with some fucking hot "bloody mary" shit in it. i was at least tipsy. i closed my eyes and walked from the end of the bar to the restroom. yep. can still do it.   i love this place. i wish i still lived in uptown i would still be here all the time. its alot cheaper then my roosevelt addiction. :\  Hanratty's has 3 pool tables, several pinball machines, and 3 dart boards, and 2 mechanical dart boards. deffinetly a great place to stop by for some 8ball.   the atmosphere here is fucking cool. it's been a valley bar for god knows how long. wood bar, wood support posts, wooden walls, wooden booths. its got more wood then a whole fleet of escalades. i think G-Unit is still jealous. put your hands on this grain my nig.....yea well you get the point.   the economy has hit this place a little rough..so if you see this review. check out the place. bars like this cannot go under. they need our support. go in and say "hi" to Frank. he's cool as hell. Sarah still cute as ever. Save Hannys!!!

quite possible the only starbucks in arizona that could be referred to as the gay starbucks and people would know what your talking about, (kinda like gay denny's), i wouldn't even relate that fame to the constant cast of characters outside "people watching" but for awhile, 90% of the employees were gay.  this starbucks is a great place to sit outside and chill and chat up the regulars. i miss alot of the former employees of this starbucks, they were all really cool people. some of them just randomly disappeared, whatever happened to that skinny guy who kinda looked like the devil, and that Blondie? what would you need to do to get fired?? being too cool for everyone? oh well.   i have been comped so many drinks here its no wonder the last two managers were fired. lol. but that's part of the things that made me love this bux. cool employees who knew how to make you come back. (maybe I'll get a free drink today....no? well maybe next time)  chain coffee shops are considered the antichrist to a lot of coffee shop superheros but lets face it. the coffee isn't so great..neither is the food, but it's the status symbol to have that green straw in your cup.

Great Dane has a good hot dog. nothing super fantastic but when your craving a hot dog and are in this neighborhood this is a good place to stop.  prices are a little meh, and the fries were so so. i got the reuben hotdog and it was tasty...except for the cheeze wiz in it. i don't remember that being in a Reuben sandwich. otherwise it was a good dog.  yelp.

disclaimer: everything you read on this review is completely true. and awesome.  about 6 or so years ago i was hauling my ass thru the 19th ave Peoria area in the middle of the night...having fun. yea!! so out of nowhere. whoop whoop. i get pulled over, long story short, i get a ticket and opt out with traffic school. so a couple weeks later.....i'm at this super huge church on the corner of Central and Glendale, you know the one. looks like a space age community college, well this was the location for traffic school. so traffic school starts early in the am, ho hum boring right. well it comes to lunch break, and this random lady stands up and announces to everyone that she is providing lunch and that she owns Luke's and will have her employees bring over Italian beef on the lunch break. i was like..cool...speeding does pay off after all. lol.  first time having Luke's was a little strange, it was delivered over and sorta mass produced. there was like 50 of us in traffic school, still really good. and i have this cool story to remember about the first time I've had Luke's. haha. I've been into the restaurant more then a hand full of occasions for normal encounters with Luke's..awesome Chicago dog.

i have vomited in the bathroom here at least a dozen times, not from the food. it's always good to have a greasy burger after a night of drinking. i usually throw up before i eat so i don't waste all the greasy goodness that is 5&Diner.  as far as diners go in phoenix, this is one of the better options. it's a real diner as opposed to Denny's or ugh, whats left..most of the others are all long closed.  5 stars for the sympathy for my vomit bursts, 3-4 for the food, 4 for the fun atmosphere after dark.  yay.     PS. i'm sorry cleaning staff. :(

so we bought a new 24 in LED display online and it arrived. everything great, waited a week or two for the new MacBookPro to arrive before we could fire it up. (mini DVI, duh whats that right? lol)  so boom it fires up for the first time and i see it. a black triangle of burned out LEDs WHOA!!! no fun. panic was released and calm restored. it's 2 weeks old, i'll take it to an Apple store for a replacement.  so Saturday morning i made an appointment at the Genius bar to have them look at it, and hopefully say, "We'll just replace it for you"....  well after an interesting turn of events on the light rail, i showed up late, only 15 minutes. but my reservation was already voided..my fault. no biggie.  i tell the guy at the genius bar check in what the deal is and he says, we can put you back in the queue and one of the genius can look at it.  i said "is there a way we can just get an exchange, i don't really want to hear that it would need to be shipped off to wherever to be fixed" he said sure, but they might have the parts there to fix it, and that the online stock and the in-store stock are different, so he might not be able to exchange but would go check into it....15 minutes later he walked out of the room behind the genius bar with another monitor. i walked over to the exclusive register since they switched over to the mobile point of sales set up. after a couple bar code scans i was walking out the store with a new monitor. a new monitor without burned out LEDs that is.   i was happy.  as far as the maddening POS system they have, i give it 3.5 stars  i get the concept and that it should speed up sales, but when your ignorant to who has one of the hand held devices or don't even know thats how you check out. you can be seriously put off by the whole process. but now that i know. i have no issues with it. who really needs a bag anyways.

i used to love this place when it was a Filibertos years ago. i was actually sitting at the drive thru window when this place was busted my immigration officers about 9 years ago..i was so upset afterwards...it went from a 24 hour food spot to a place that closed at 10pm :(  ohh memories. i haven't tried it since it changed to Federico's but lets face it. all these places are pretty much the same. cheap delicious food that is a gamble every single time.

First, i'm not a fish eating person. but i was meeting my friend for lunch yesterday and figured this would be a good place to start..we both commented on how cute its signage was and we remember it used to be over on Buckeye. but now it's firmly placed just off the 24th Street Light Rail exit on jefferson.  i was waiting around for my friend's train to arrive and the smell of Mandy's was intoxicating. i was getting hungry minute by minute. finally train arrives and we head over to the end of the light rail platform, jump over the rail gate and cross the street to Mandy's. yes..we could have done the right thing and walked all the way back to 24th street. but lets face it..why. its right there. RIGHT THERE~!!  anyways..so again..not being one to eat fishy creatures that once swam in water..i got the double cheese burger, some onion rings and a drink. friend got the Fish and chips combo. white fish..i think it was cod, they have the option to coat with corn meal, or London style. which im guessing is a beer batter. similar to how the onion rings were coated.  burger..cheesy, juicy, and very good. onion rings, cripsy-crunchy and full of onion flavor. fries..well..could be better..and i tried a small taste of the fish..it was good..for fish.   i highly recommend people check out Mandy's..i'm honestly shocked to be the first to review. SHOCKED..ok.  off the lightrail...just a couple minutes from the Priest train station.  not too far from Mill either. jump on this place.   OMG i almost forgot..they have Thrifty Brand Ice Cream. !!!!!!

Belch!!!  since everyone else is doing it..i'll add a review to Mi Amigos  the food is the bestist in the wholde worlde  they has a margarita with real taquila in it. not like those fancy places who serve bootlegged taquila..  the rice is perfectly expolded and fluffy just the way rice should be..and the beans...well don't get me started on the beans..i'm still powering a rocket booster as we speak. the best part is the chips..totally authentic. no bag taste here at all..in fact i think they personally make them in the back...twice a year.   yumm yummm.

the Sets is only good for 3 stars, but i'm bumping it to four because they have a pretty cool outside patio  bar area that i can smoke with a drink, and it's enclosed so i don't feel like i'm sitting in the parking lot.  i've seen a couple hip-hop shows here and as far as the sound is concerned it's pretty good.  my buddy was passed a joint on the patio once and security told him to put it out...as opposed to throwing us out. so cool creds go to them. one of the performers of the night passed it to him, so i guess if we got kicked out it would have been their loss too. haha.  waited here 3 hours for KRS-ONE...honestly thats my worse experience here...still annoys the shit out of me. otherwise i'll keep seeing shows here. its better then chasers.

Going into this place really teleports you to an east coast bar/pub  Unfortunetly the local customers are not what you expect to see in an east coast bar/pub  No obvious cops shooting the shit after a shift, frankly not a lot of people at all. Of the two bars that shared the McCaffrey name. this bar is by far the lesser of the two. From what I've heard Seamus doesn't even own this place anymore. Maybe that is part of the problem...  Police patches adorn the bar..so I'm surprised to not see any police.  There used to be a large collections of lepperchans, I didn't see them last time I went (pub crawl) but I did see a friend from another bar...that was cool. Other then that..i will continue to stay clear of Seamus McCaffery's.   Sorry Bud.  may ye luck be at anothee Baah

was looking for something different, and have seen this place..allot. I'm a native Phoenix resident after all.  first i checked yelp and saw 3-4 stars based on 6 reviews. i figured sketchy, but with such a glowing review from Pierre i figured it must be good. umm. no.  my cohort ordered the chow mien. she took one bite and said no. it was drenched in a chicken gravy Ala sick. i took a bite and agreed I've had better out of ChungKing's can. in fact i wouldn't be surprised if this slop came from a can. flavorless chicken, crisp from a can celery..like seriously machine cut from a factory and stuffed into a can.  i ordered the egg foo young, with barbecue pork. it was decent to average, nothing special. i was kinda surprised to not see gills or fins on my egg foo young patties...as they were swimming in a 1 inch deep puddle of a gravy. while the gravy tasted good, i kinda like the option to drown my own food. not have it delivered to me already floating.  Pierre can keep his nostalgic toilet bowl of Chinese fare. i respect almost all of your reviews. sing high. meh. for the 17 bucks we spent on two plates, i could have gotten 4 cans of ChungKing's chow mien.  I'm not really sure how this place has lasted 80 years. I'm sure somewhere in recent history this place is a front for heroin or something else elicit. restaurants like this cannot simply survive on this quality of food. they have 3 dinning rooms and while we visited about 10 customers.   The wait staff is mediocre, when the lady asked how we liked the food, my friend said she did not like the chow mien, she asked if my friend would like something else, while this could have been an option if she had come 15 minutes earlier after the first bite, but it was too late by now, and when the response was no, there was no attempt to make it better by removing the food from the bill. don't expect our return.   poor service, poor to mediocre food, poor atmosphere, 1 star. i would consider two if you took the chow mien off the bill. :P

went here on a break from Jury Duty once. it was ok. nothing memorable. i was just reminded of this place because i ate at Thai Elephant the other night and its right next door.  food, typical take out teriyaki, absolutly nothing special. nothing memorable, and will not miss this place much. holds nothing compared to Blue Fin, sorry Yasda Bento. needs improvement.   maybe a signiture dish...because just spicy versions of the norm isn't going to cut it.

i've lived in the downtown area for like 85% of my life and have only ventured into the heritage square area a few times for Heritage Squarish events...usually it's a walk thru to the Arizona Science Center or to a parking lot. but i was here two weekends back to back for the NBA All-Star game tip off party and the Matsuri Festival a week later..and wow. this place can have some awesome things happening.  the tip off party...75-80 bucks for a ticket..and full range to entertainment lots of food and drinks to sample...free of course. plus the museum and science center were open. live DJ music and access to Pizzeria Bianco and Rose and Crown. totally made my night. the Matsuri Festival was alot of fun, saw Jack play the drums, saw some kids dressed up as anime and manga characters. no free drinks that day. but still was alot of fun.  Heritage Square gets my 4 stars for being a cool place to have things to do. plus the old houses and stuff rock.

"YUMMMMMMM" - Nadia C.  calabria is awesome. the sandwiches are delishious i've tried 3-4 different sandwiches, each one was awesomeness. at under 8 bucks each, it's not as cheap as subway or other chain sandwich places but lets face it. fresh is way better. the italian sandwich is my fave, the mortadella here is f'n fantastic and the salami is pure meaty awesomeness. all the deli meat is available at the counter and is sliced when sandwiches are ordered.   i have not shopped here for groceries as i'm still content with safeway, fresh & easy, and sprouts. plus i'm not italian..so i do not desire all the little "special" ingrediants for italian foods. i'm a little miffed by the hours they are open. only 4pm on a saturday and closed on Sundays? this is a little neighborhood shop. i would actually go here more if they were opened more. but it's a family business..so i guess their family is more important then running a business.  oh well, i'll keep having wet dreams over the italian sandwich on sundays when i cannot have one. :(

mediocrity   according to Merriam-Webster is defined as:   Main Entry: mediocrity  Pronunciation: \m-d-ä-kr-t\  Function: noun  Inflected Form(s): plural mediocrities  Date: 1588  1 a: the quality or state of being mediocre b: moderate ability or value    i can't really add much to it. my last review described the place. i tried the food last night and it was adequate but nothing that would blow my socks off. my friend commented on the inept plating of her meal, she was quite disappointed. and i don't blame her. the appearance of prepacked salad is disappointing considering the price point.   the place is really handsome and i just wish the food complimented it. everything seemed prepackaged and uninspired.  i really do not want to see a vacant lot on the corner of the building i live in. so i hope this place is doing ok.

Piercing is serious business Jerry T. piercing guns are barbaric and hurt crazy bad compared to a needle. lol.  yes pin cushion needs an open mind that if you want to take the gun its your right. but also consider the fact you are going to a piercing place. i don't think a respectable piercer would use a gun, just on the basis its violent, and holy shit it hurts. to argue with him as why they dont almost begs for the elitist response you got. so take some responsibility for the exchange.   Megan D. I'm glad your a physician, but lets face it. 99% of the customers are not. and it's the stores policy. so regardless you lose.  on to the review.   OK...so I'm new to Yelping or this would have been done along time ago. Halo is the best place to get pierced, they are no nonsense and take the shit serious. they are professional. this is not a tattoo shop piercing.   95% of my piercings and stretching were done at Halo; both ears at 10g and the following stretchings till 7/16s when i stopped, the stretchings of my septum (8g) and lebret (10g), my tongue and the following stretchings of it (8g). always top notch service. ALWAYS. Glenn and Kelsey are the best. I'm not sure on the new staff its been awhile since i have been there for service. but the new staff have been adequate for my questions. I'm not a noob. so i don't need to be reminded to not lean on the glass. lol.  top notch jewelery. being sterile is super important, that's why they put the gloves on. when you buy jewelery its already sterile. it would be time consuming if they did it in the opposite order. waiting for the autoclave to sterilize your jewelery you just purchased. lol get real. that would suck.    Love ya!! thanks for always a great experiance.

Kelly...i love you.  i don't know how many other people really enjoy paper products. but as a part time book fabricator i truly enjoy this place. yes for the most part you can get you bulky copy paper. but i frequently purchase stacks of paper to fold, punch, glue, umm, adhese, my carefully selected papers into books. its alot of fun to just browse the aisles and pick up samples to see how they react to an already plentiful collection of papers.   the selection is out of this world. and the store is very clean. the staff is very helpful and make an effort to answer any questions. custom orders are available for odd sized paper requests. they usually have your custom cut papers back in 24 hours.  if your not like me and you just need some copy paper. it's a great business to get paper from. the uptown location is just before 15th ave on Indian School.

[Review for the Shop] [Hidden House review below]  I'm slightly bias as i have been going to "the Shop" for a few years now. Al Page kills it, KGB Kills IT, Soul man Kills It, Chris the Fist Kills IT!, every DJ i missed...well you sorta Kill it too. lol.  but the above mentioned can turn this place out.  now atmosphere. lets just say, house party. i think the maximum occupancy for Bruno Malli's is like 50 people. i have been nights where 300 people were there pumping there firsts.  i have also been there nights and it was so dead that there was 6 people until midnight rolled around, and then all of a sudden the jail doors ripped open and there was a hundred drunk fools dancing.  drinks, yeah they be cheep. bartenders, yeah sometimes you get skipped over. shit i know they names and I'm yelling at them and they still don't hear me. Stacey, Katy.. still love ya. always poor my drinks right..so I'm not talkin shit.  Cash Only...yea that hurt me because i hate having to be packin cash. 40 bucks and by the time you and your friends are in the door and got a drink in your hand you start to question. how cheep are these drinks again?  smoking outside sucks but at least your not alone, there are always like 30 people outside smoking. some people say there is no mingling inside. well everyone is outside mingling over their camels' and Marlboro Reds'  bathroom, umm ladies only on this side (yeah right) so guys have to walk over to the Hidden House side. i've seen cleaner bathrooms in beiruit. i quickly get in and get the fuck out. don't touch anything. sink is optional, but sometimes it looks worse then the toilet.  figure i'll spill some vodka on my hands and call them clean.  ok back to the beats. Al spins Oldschool, and neo-soul for the most part and his hand selected dj's follow suit. you can expect to hear anything from Hierogplyics, to the Jackson 5. shit is eclectic for sure. don't expect to hear any of the current club bangers or Crunk Juice music, and especially no Hyphy go dumb music. meh.  i did get KGB to play some e-40 once. lol. anyways.   come out and have some fun.   [Hidden House]  i don't know what hidden house is really. not a dive bar, too bright. not a sports bar, not enough tvs. not a restaurant, yes it has food.  its kinda  neighborhood spot. expect txhold'm tournements, pool huslting, network jukebox, large horseshoe bar, tables and booths, missing waitress.  for a bar i give it 3 stars, way too bright. but the booze is still cheap.  did someone say blue moon on tap? yeah. can't go wrong there. the service staff is nice.   i have been stinking drunk on this side more then a few times, and have puked outside the bathroom...yea i'm not ashamed. it happened. don't act like you've never puked somewhere in public. all in all i still return. not as often as before and i normally stick to the Shop side.

Mi Patio is one of those restuants i really do not like. and i cannot understand why people do. the food isn't very good, and the margaritas are just as bad. i've been to Mi Patio as a kid and i remember it being a bit better, but as a kid i don't think you truely understand the different between good and bad. it is what it is and you enjoy it because it's different. as an adult. i'm paying for this shit. and it's regretful. i will not lie, i'll eat here on someone elses dime. but i'll save my shillings for something a wee bit better...like macyo's lol.

i have never been to Thai Rama. i have always wanted to try it. but it wasn't really close or convenient to go to. i happened to be in the area so figured would check it out. food was less then spectacular. after 20 years...i am not really sure if it's just down graded from quality or bad suppliers. i don't know. the spring rolls. totally from a box, flash frozen. the insides were mushy and the flavors not distinct. also got the won tons. saving grace here. they were good. the pork nugget inside of it could stand to be a bit bigger. it is dwarfed by the won ton wrapper. still was really good.   i have chosen to make Pad Thai as my barometer for Thai restaurants I'm going to review on Yelp. if they cannot make this "signature" dish then the rest of the menu might as well be rat poison. the pad Thai was flavorful, the noodles were a tasty pile of mush. it had really long mung beans which i like. so it wasn't all bad. in fact it wasn't bad tasting. but honestly for 9+ bucks. i could have picked this up at Safeway from a box called "Taste of Thai" for 2.50 and cooked it myself.   atmosphere is ok. kinda old, cute menus with home made paper. with the menu items printed on a transparency. hmm. now that i think about it..it's kinda cheese. but whatever.   service was good. quick turn around. and my glass was only empty twice....but to think about it..they only filled it twice...so it was empty.....so that means...i was thirsty..and my drink was empty. hmmm ok thats kinda nit picky. it was fine. 3-4 stars if the food was umm fresher. or at least not supplied by sysco.   in conclusion. this place might have been around for 20 years. but when there are not better options. [Thai Basil, Thai Elephant, Wild Thaiger, even Thai Hut...] and your the only Thai restaurant in a 20 mile radius...you can last. but i shouldn't need to point out...that you have some serious competition in the area..and their prices are about the same.  i really wanted to make a funny review about this place. but lets face it. Thai food is seriez bizness, only deserving a serious review.

I'm slightly bias as i have been going to "the Shop" for a few years now. Al Page kills it, KGB Kills IT, Soul man Kills It, Chris the Fist Kills IT!, every DJ i missed...well you sorta Kill it too. lol.  but the above mentioned can turn this place out.  now atmosphere. lets just say, house party. i think the maximum occupancy for Bruno Malli's is like 50 people. i have been nights where 300 people were there pumping there firsts.  i have also been there nights and it was so dead that there was 6 people until midnight rolled around, and then all of a sudden the jail doors ripped open and there was a hundred drunk fools dancing.  drinks, yeah they be cheep. bartenders, yeah sometimes you get skipped over. shit i know they names and I'm yelling at them and they still don't hear me. Stacey, Katy.. still love ya. always poor my drinks right..so I'm not talkin shit.  Cash Only...yea that hurt me because i hate having to be packin cash. 40 bucks and by the time you and your friends are in the door and got a drink in your hand you start to question. how cheep are these drinks again?  smoking outside sucks but at least your not alone, there are always like 30 people outside smoking. some people say there is no mingling inside. well everyone is outside mingling over their camels' and Marlboro Reds'  bathroom, umm ladies only on this side (yeah right) so guys have to walk over to the Hidden House side. i've seen cleaner bathrooms in beiruit. i quickly get in and get the fuck out. don't touch anything. sink is optional, but sometimes it looks worse then the toilet.  figure i'll spill some vodka on my hands and call them clean.  ok back to the beats. Al spins Oldschool, and neo-soul for the most part and his hand selected dj's follow suit. you can expect to hear anything from Hierogplyics, to the Jackson 5. shit is eclectic for sure. don't expect to hear any of the current club bangers or Crunk Juice music, and especially no Hyphy go dumb music. meh.  i did get KGB to play some e-40 once. lol. anyways.   come out and have some fun.

ok..so i had a really good friend who took me here a few times...well not here..actually when it was on Indian School and 7th st. it looks so much more inviting now. i just need to bring myself to want to gorge nom nom nom on some fry bread. it's like a big pile of fried crack. you seriously get hooked on the decadent fried morsals. topped with hot and saveries these are just to kill for. maybe even worth dying for. a sweet one is excelent..nom nom nom. ok i think i need to end this post before i eat my keyboard.

ode to a Chilaquiles.  so i ate some Chilaquiles at Pepe's the other morning. not ever having Chilaquiles before i was not sure if my Chilaquiles was good or great, but the Chilaquiles was good to me. very tasty Chilaquiles that is. i had my Chilaquiles with hard fried eggs because i'm not a fan of runny yoke. my Chilaquiles egg was only 85% to my requested hard fried, resulting in a missing star. tho my Chilaquiles was very good. my Chilaquiles was made with a tomatoes salsa texture of sauce..watery in a way..but not knowing how Chilaquiles should look..i thought it was good. Chilaquiles.  the tortilla chips are also good. and i kinda liked the squeeze bottles. cause i just squeeze it onto a chip and put it in my mouth. tasty salsas..i squirted a bunch onto my Chilaquiles egg that wasn't fried enough..so i didn't notice the runny texture. Chilaquiles. Chilaquiles. the beans with my Chilaquiles had white cheese on them, alot of mexican restuarants use a handful of yellow cheese so i was impressed..it wasn't crumble queso-fresco..but it was still tasty with my Chilaquiles. Chilaquiles.   ok i think i have used Chilaquiles eighteen times now..umm ok nineteen times...so to finish off with an even twenty...Chilaquiles. yummm. ohh btw they take bank cards now.

i agree with tina n. hands down the best shop in Arizona. Ron tattood my forarms like 5 years ago and the edges are just as sharp as the day i got them. when people ask me where i got my tattoos i tell them with pride, "Immaculate, the best shop in the valley"   i know alot of random people who have sleeves from aaron and the detail and colors are just amazing. saving up some cash...i really want to go back asap. :)   from what i've heard Aaron commends a fairly good chunk of change, so i marked it as pricey, but i don't remember it being all that expensive when i went. plan ahead, i think there is a waiting list on Aaron 6+ months.

they has nice water.     i've only been here a couple times, but every time has been enjoyable.  but last night i just drank water and tried to hydrate up.   my most common experiance with Four Peaks is drinking their Hefe at the Roosevelt. I guess if i lived near Tempe, i could be convinced to drink here more often.

lets face it Phoenix metro area is in a serious drought of good venues when the marquee is a spot.  i've been here a couple dozen times and each time its pretty much the same, crowded, loud, and hard on teh feetz. drinks are decent, and i kinda like the beers on tap. but security is a little nazi'ish..i know nobody wants to see anyone else get stabbed up in the face..but lets face it. who usually goes to a show with a steel? um not many. who goes into a show with their glock? umm not many again. i understand the sneaking in booze...but i'm always smelling reef'r up in here.  so...what exactly is security doing? umm just slowing up the line. ease up. we are not getting on an air plane...i shouldn't have to unlace my 20eye grinders because i could have something in there considered contraband. it takes long enough to lace them up..the hassle of getting that knife/joint/gun/grenade/bazooka/harrier jet/or nuke i have hidden in there out is completely prohibitive.   like. um..ok.  otherwise i like this place. backstage is pretty cool too. :P

so today my coworker trace was looking for a place to get lunch, carne asada was on the request. i quickly jumped on Yelp did a search for Carne Asada in our work zip code and low and behold El Yaqui came up and it was pretty close and had a glowing review from Angelo C.   it was confirmed that this place is not on the street, but instead inside a market place.   the carne asada burrito is delicious, grilled and chopped meat, seasoned right, with grilled onions and beans. wrapped up in foil to keep it warm with a side of lime and pickled carrots and a salsa. from what i can tell from the beans in the burrito, they are awesome. lardy and smooth just the way they should be. 1 million calories later...   I'm in carne asada coma now.   if your in the area, or work around here. check this place out...

so Friday night was the first time i have ever tasted the pizza at Pizzeria Bianco..while they only had two types of pizza out for samples...a Margarita type pizza and a sausage and carmelized onion pizza..the lady said it had a name..i thought she was joking..and quickly forgot what it was... the sausage was full of fennel flavor and i thought it was awesome.   i was totally stoked to see that pizzeria bianco was open during the NBA All Star game Tip Off Party at Heritage Square.   now i gotta find time to actually have a sit down dinner here. i totally believe the hype.  i also heard that the Pizza oven at the AJ's on Camelback and Central was built by Bianco...true?

had a wonderful lunch today with two of my favorite ladies. Ms Cha Cha and the illustrious Tiphanie Brooke. it was a two part birthday lunching as it was Ms. Cha Cha's birthday last week and mine is upcoming. we agreed upon Durant's as its usually one of my favorite places for birth celebrations.  i got a burger, the BBQ Cheddar Bacon burger..it was a deliciously sloppy wonderfully sexy in a beefy way. okay. Tiphanie enjoyed the prime rib cut and it was perfectly rare and melted in ones mouth...yes it melted in mine..so i can judge that. Ms Cha Cha enjoyed the other delicious burger with bacon on it..Bacon Burger...no fancy naming..oh well.  5 stars? well as my previous review stated it can be awesome or so so. well today was awesome and i probably shouldn't have been so wishy washy about it before. i have always had a great time here..rarely has the food been subpar. so back to the top i take my rating. do i suggest this place to my friends and strangers alike? yea..it's a tradition.

Sunday brunch at Barrio is something i always look forward to. the atmosphere is cute as can be. the artwork is always interesting.  and the food is really something special. so today i am out with family to sunday brunch.   my favorite thing is the coffee, I'm a huge fan of french press, and the coffee is unbelievable. i ordered the huevos con chorizo. very tasty. the chorizo is semi spicy. accompanying the eggs and chorizo are the potatoes. very tasty. waxy potatoes steamed till tender and then i think pan cooked real quick with some seasoning. how ever they are cooked they are very good. we also ordered the guacamole. typically if you get dinner guacamole they prepare it at the table for you. brunch..they bring you a bowl of it prepared in the kitchen. no complaints here. i just like it anyway i get it. very very spicy with a hint of sweet from the cranberries they toss in. always satisfied when i leave barrio.  they open at 11:00am for sunday brunch and expect a line. at both entrances. show up after 11...expect a line.  either way its worth showing up for.  I've eaten dinner here a few times, which i will leave another review the next time i go. for now i think the brunch deserves 5 stars.

everytime i have been here it just appalls me this place is still in business.  "This place seems like a total dump," while it may be out of context to Jaime M's review. i will confirm this place is a dump. it's horrid. i have on more then 3 occasions seen roaches scurry across the ground. on one occasion witnessed a minor stirring beans in a large pot. never have i had a good experience here. some of my family members love this place and come and drink margaritas from noon till they decide to leave. so i have been here enough times to know this is not a one time occurrence bad review. margaritas are cheap. but that's because they are shit. in my opinion. i like tequila with my margarita mix. umm thanks.  the food. ugh. more then a few occasions i have had intestinal discomfort. the taste is good. but the second coming of Jesus 40 minutes later is not good. i hate to give this place such a bad review because my family will hate me. but I've voiced my review to them enough they should expect this.  stay away. there are MANY Mexican restaurants in Arizona. and if this is authentic Sonoran. holy crap. i prefer the non-authentic Sonoran i get from other restaurants. i would go to Manuel's over this place any day.

update, and a warning to you.  repeat visit 1: a nickel in the nachos, not a dime, a fucking nickel....last i check this is a major health violation.  repeat visit 2:  egg shells in my Chorizo Burrito.   on a positive note: i didn't see any insect diners on my table. but i didn't look underneath it in fear of seeing a swarm. remember that movie Candyman..remember the bee's in the toilet...yea that gives you a mental picture.  this place must have some serious pull to not have been shut down by now.

Delux, what did you do to yourself? you get all these awesome reviews and then you let you asshole fall out.   the first two times i ate here pretty close to just after you opened i had great food and good service. the grilled cheese was awesome and your burgers too..the fries were good, especially the sweet potato ones.   the last 3 times i visited your bosom, i was turned away by the uppity, unintelligent service staff and the lack luster food. did i miss something? do you just not care about your appearance anymore? have you been turned out so long you are a used up toothless whore now? i think so. sorry honey, I've found some new piece of ass.   keep on strolling.

i like gelato spot, if i'm in the area i'll stop in for something. i love how they have very unique flavors and let you sample them. i could stand there an sample every flavor they have just to avoid paying for some. but...i don't think every flavor would mix well. i'd probably get sick.   that would not be a good thing. it would then be a vomit spot. :\ thats no good.

my day job will on occasion get catering from Famous Dave's BBQ  we usually only get pulled pork, chicken, and brisket, the beans, and potato salad.   the Pork is pretty good. the brisket is smoky. but i don't normally order brisket anywhere so i cannot really compare it. the beans are pretty good...its got meat in it!!!. the potato salad is tasteless. meh.   the sauce is REALLY good. i prefer the Devil's Spit. i still have a packet of it on my desk. trying to figure what I'm going to put it on. my hand looks pretty tasty... ARRRGH!!!!   ok..I'll save the rest to put on real food.

had a great time at Cibo last night. couldn't have asked for more, great company, great food..the only thing holding it back from 5 stars...was that some jackass was incapable of using a urinal correctly and pissed all over the floor. i know this isn't really the restaurants fault, they cannot have a 24/7 bathroom nanny to make sure its spotless for my liking, but it did distract from me really really liking everything there.

i did the one thing you will never do. the one thing you would never imagine. and yes i did it.  i added bacon to the Fez Vegi-Burger. and it was delicious.  i know what you are thinking...omg that sounds friggin awesome...and you would be right. but you wouldn't be the first to taste it...nope. that would be me. so...you will just need to try it...and accept the fact you are second. third. tenth. or thousandth by now.     yes i know i'm genius.

i know the real secret to Matt's Wu-tang Style.   some people may think Matt's is over rated. but i know that to be false. Matt's is THE BEST BREAKFAST...period. there has not been a single time i was unhappy with the service, price, or wait.  i would wait an hour, heck two hours if need be.   the 5-spot is by far my favorite breakfast item. its like a full on taste cell orgy. with over 50 taste cells per taste bud and a human tongue containing several million taste buds you have to figure that is alot of ecstasy in your mouth.   if i could justify the time spent waiting as a business expense i would be there every morning.   Matt and Erenia have a great thing going here.

never in my life have i been so happy to dine and dash before. i won't give a time it happened, nor will i ever return, so i honestly don't fear retribution.  but after waiting 30 minutes between drinks, and then never saw the waitress again i was so fed up with this place i just walked the fuck out. if they don't care enough about the customers to at least make their rounds every 5-10 minutes to see if we are happy. then they certainly don't care about my money. which by the way i would have been happy to give them. the drinks were good. but i was sober before the next one arrived. unless they are freezing the ice cubes to order, there is no reason for a delay. I'm not going to cause a fuss and complain to the manager. I'm sure the wait on a manager would have been just as bad as the service. so kick rocks. I'm out.  from my experience, i really don't think this establishment deserves more then 1 star. i would give 0 if it was possible.

i have lived half a mile from Tammie Coe for about 2 years now and i have never been there. my friends birthday weekend is here, so we have been out and about checking out some new spots and testing others. i won't say i have never had Tammie Coe cakes before, because I've tasted about 4-5 cakes.   on occasion Lauren, from my favorite salon, the Root, [see my other reviews] will buy Tammie Coe cakes for the waiting area. I'm not a huge fan of the fondant topping. the flavor is good, but it's excessive and sweeeeeeeeeeeeeet. ahem. as i was saying. i have never been to the shop on Roosevelt. so we decide to head over there after checking out Mel's Diner. i got an Americano, and we picked up the cup cake trio, a peanut butter cookie, oatmeal cookie and the lime cookies.  i will try to break this one down by item.  lime cookies, the flavor makes your mouth water as if you were sucking on limes. it's that powerful. they are actually just plain awesomeness. our only complaint..they should be the size of the "other" cookies.  peanut butter cookie, very peanut-buttery and very thick. the consistency of the cookie is excellent. for such a huge cookie i was kinda expecting a hockey puck consistency. but it was buttery and crumbled into nice little bites.  oatmeal cookie, this cookie is very good. i like chocolate chip cookies. and i like oatmeal raisin cookies. this is like a blend of the two..minus the raisins. sweet and decadent.   the cupcake trio is the toffee one, I'm not sure why it's pink. the coconut one, and a chocolate one.  Chocolate one was my second favorite of the 3. creamy chocolate frosting caked ontop of a yummy banana-bread cupcake. this...is...awesome.  pink one..toffee something i guess. least favorite. the pink things are good, the cake is good too. but it's just not my taste.  coconut one. yup. that's the one. my favorite. i love coconut, plus the damned thing is frosted with cream cheese like frosting. which...my favorite cake is carrot cake..so this is right up that same fat inducing alley. thanks Tammie Coe for heroine of cup cakes.  Tammie Coe also serves Illy Coffee. so you know its good. my Americano was the figuratively speaking icing on the cake.

i would have rather had Tacos' De Juarez to be honest.  i was completely left unimpressed. i would rate this place lower if the food wasn't at least decent. i was going to rate it 3 stars but after reliving all my greivences in my head i need to put it down to two. i will come back for another try sometime..better luck then. on to my review...  i shared the rib eye tacos with my friend which tasted great, the meat was rare as requested, but what annoyed me is we were given a bowl of whole beans in a soup instead of mashed frijoles like another guest who ordered tacos. where is the consistency here? the molded rice tower was interesting for plating. the rice had good flavor and didn't seem as blown out as other mexican restaurant rices i have had.  i also tried the lobster quasadilla. i was tragicly disapointed. it was void of flavor, and the sauce on top was not very appealing when i tasted it on it's own. the inside was mushy...but not in a mushy melted cheese way. it was just mushy.  service was mediocre, guests who ordered drinks were left waiting 20 minutes without them. the place was dead last night so there is no excuse of being overwhelmed. i ordered a Dos XX's draft and it tasted flat, so my second drink i opted for a can of PBR. umm 3.50 for a can of PRB is hilarious. i can get a 12 pack at safeway for 5 something i think.  last on my gripe list...originally i ordered duck tacos..she took the order, and then came back to tell me they didn't have them. shouldn't the servers know this? the kitchen staff needs to let servers know what is out before they start taking orders. if when i ordered the duck tacos she said "i'm sorry we are actually out of duck tonight" i would have been ok.. and ordered something else or asked to be skipped till everyone else had ordered. instead i get to have her come back with menus and tell me "sorry we are out of duck tacos". (:-\) no bueno!    Padre's you want to play yourself off as semi upscale mexican restaurant charging 15$ for 3 small tacos. service and atmosphere isn't deserving of your priceing. at least put my PBR in a glass instead of serving it to me in a can.   in conclusion, i will give Padres another shot. but i am in no hurry to return.

No Mercy here. like Kreese said in the Karate Kid "We do not train to be merciful here. Mercy is for the weak"  this was the worse dining experience i have ever had the misfortune to be subjected to. I've had superior customer service at a McDonald's. this was a rolling charade of a farce of a bad joke told to you by your creepy uncle.  food was horrible, steamed bag servings "cooked" to order. i split a shrimp alfredo with another dinner guest, and the bowls were huge, the serving not so much, the shrimp, previously frozen, the pasta in the alfredo...angelhair. ummm. interesting. the risotto, frozen and reheated most likely in a boiling bag. water was never refilled, at one point the waitress just dropped off a pitcher of water..nice...but for a table of 12 it was too cumbersome to pass it around. we were forced to get up and refill our own glasses. fail.  finally we all had eaten our mediocre "Chow" and were ready to leave, half the party wanted to go Scottsdale clubbing and the other half wanted to go back to the valley ho...neither of our groupings were allowed to leave...held captive by the incompetent waitress and the bill. 30 minutes later, everyone is standing around the table wanting nothing more then to escape this prison. 30 minutes after cards given, she returns and hands us 2 pens. ARGH!!!!   yes i know it's not fast or easy to run 8 cards. but you were more concerned with running us with the built on gratuity for party's over 8 that you didn't ask if we wanted separate bills upfront. the service was soo bad that the forced gratuity for a large party was painful. what compounds the rage was after we took the time to collect all the credit cards from the guests and write down the amounts they wanted charged to the card, all considering tip, she still added the forced gratuity resulting in a double tip....a tip on service that was plain incompetence. it's outrageous. WE refilled our own glasses, WE collected and prepared a billing list for the waitress...otherwise she took a food order, and eventually brought it back to us. she was not a good host, not attentive, and was scarecly seen.  the atmosphere is OK, but nothing nice enough to compensate or remedy the rest of the service. i would re-eat vomit before i step foot in this establishment again.  food and atmosphere are not worth the trouble.

i adore the old style theatre. i wish there were more of them around. the carpet is all worn, the gentle slope of the seating area. yup. i'm in love. i'm a big fan of gentle slopes. ;)  if i wanted to climb a flight of stairs to watch a movie, i would put a stair master in front of my LCD TV.  the selection of movies at camelview is awesome. i love indy movies so its fun to see them in theatre as opposed...to..um. not.

this is by far my favorite Macy's the selection is by far better then the others, even fashion square seems to fall flat on my fancy. the fragrance selection is good, and they have my favorite brands of clothing and the clearance racks have always saved me some money.  Yelp.

one word, NACHOS,   yes. you heard me. Nachos' absolutly the best fucking nachos in the world.  pulled pork ontop of cheesy chippy goodness. i cried the first time i tried these. not because i cut my mouth on a chip. but because i was so full i couldn't finish them.  other notables are the grilled cheese, awesome, the hamburger, awesome. the hot wings, triple awesome. oh and the bar isnt' to shabby either. actually the bar is one of my favorite places to drink. but i'm not going to venture to sunnyslope area just to drink. but, if you like to venture to drink. put this place on your list. it is seriously one of the bests. the bartenders greet you and give you their name, and they will remember yours.  i've run into bartenders from here at several different places and they still remember me. but lets face it. if you have met me. you will remember me. i'm just that kind of person.   actually its the fact i put away maker's mark like nobody's business. but i'll leave that up to you on our next sitdown together.

by far i think this is my favorite bar in area.  in walking distance. good selection of beer. nice wait staff. comfortable seating. greate environment.  food is awesome. my favs are the grilled cheese and tomatoe soup, the giant pretzel and the bowl of roasted nuts.  great place to just chill with friends. also if your adverntures sit at the conversation table in the back room. great place to meet new people. if you feel like being private, check out the forward room.  prices are good. not exactly cheep. but the environment is worth it. slightly upscale in a good way. not too yuppie.  owner is Matt from Matt's Big Breakfast.

i still have nothing bad to say about the Roosevelt. i have been comfortable in every room of this building. my current favorite room is the forward room with the couch and arm chairs. very comfortable to just relax and put your feet up. the middle room is good for a group of friends who would like to chit chat and nosh on some food. the table set ups are high and the stool/chairs are of equal height. if you are in a large group, there is the back room which has a large table for group conversation and some sit down food and drinks. my least favorite room is the room off the front door..and only because it can be very drafty in there when the door doesn't want to stay closed. but it's still very comfortable just to sit and have a beer. i honestly have never sat at the bar...but i am usually here with friends or want to be left alone. so sitting at the bar doesn't really suit me.  the prices are decent, 4.5 on the low end, 6 on the high end for a draft and they have specialty large bottles for a bit more. the food is also really good. but like most places wax and waine depending on the day and staff. lol. pretzel still rocks my socks.  my only issue is as a smoker, i have to be corraled into a small nook off to the right of the outdoors kitchen, hidden behind a tree..."is arik over there?" " dunno all i see is a tree" ohh well. i'm a pariah for smoking anyways. i'm used to it.  overall i can confirm this is my favorite place to drink and relax.

i am so happy with Siu Wok. the food was yummy, got Pepper Steak, pork fried rice and tangerine beef.  the Pepper steak was seasoned right, mild spicyness and the sauce was exactly what i was looking for. vegies were still crisp and the meat was tender.  the tangerine beef was awesome. orangy but not overly orange. sweet in the best way, long red chili peppers soaking in the sauce. yum. the meat was fried crispy but  was still tender. just the way i like my tangerine beef.  the fried rice was great. nothing too fancy. just perfect.   the egg rolls were tasty and seemed fresh.  for the above it was around 23 bucks. very affordable.  the best part about the whole thing. they deliver. OMG!! chinese food delivered. Phoenix is a real city now. the delivery range is from 40th street to 40 ave, bethany home to broadway.   all in all a very good experiance and i will be ordering more from them. probably often.

i hate chasers, and it has nothing to do with being kicked out at a show and then having to drive all the way to flagstaff the night after to see the show i wanted to see. fuckers.  i have had to argue with bar staff about mixed drinks they made wrong.  i'm not a huge fan of whiskey sours. but look..they should be sour.  she tastes it, no thats right.. i say, no..it's not. she pours sour mix out of the bar gun thingy, hmmm. sour mix is out..its just pumping water.  no shit...  /rant  stage and sound are not really my thing, i kind of like the stage to be at least 4 feet above ground level.  but whatever. i'll leave the getting thrown out story to offline chat. lol.

this is by far one of the better bars in the roosevelt area. great selection of beer. atmosphere very hip. deffinelty a hipster bar, i think the bike rack outside says enough.  the price is average for a psudo speak easy.   if you have never been to lost leaf, think house party. the "bar" is basicly a converted kitchen. beer bottles crown the cabinetry and instead of a traditional fridge, there is a clear face beverage fridge. they also have below counter coolers as well.   accoustics are decent, but gets very very loud when they have a live jam band. great experiance.

what a wonderful gem the valley ho is.  built in the 50's this landmark was a work in progress for several years till it finally reopened in december '05. they say the remodel was 18 months, but i could have sworn this place was downtrodden for years before the remodel. but anyways, the place is hot now.  if the valley ho was in Phoenix i could see myself here often, but being in scottsdale and me being a proud cenpho spokesperson, i don't know how often i will be tempted by the awesome decor and styling of this retro redux boutique hotel.   i took the time to walk around the grounds and check out the architecture and groundskeeping. everything was beautiful. i didn't want to just write a review on an awesome saturday at the pool and gloss over the appearance of the hotel as a whole..this place is spectacular.   so the reason i was at the Valley Ho? well if was a friends birthday and she was throwing a big bash with her friend Luis. sort of a double birthday thing. a couple rooms had been acquired and two cabanas by the pool.  we stocked up one of the rooms with drinks and spent the whole day lounging by the pool. which was beautiful. people watching was fun, there was several scottsdale perverts with cameras on hand taking pictures of the younger women in bathing suits, and then there was the flock of women who had been "left" at the valley ho as their rich businessmen husbands were out traveling or doing business...  the cabana next to us had a lovely group of women out from Orange County for their friends bachelorette party. very happy group of people to be next to. and made great neighbors for the day  the pool staff was somewhat attentive, but competent and made sure the cabanas were serviced and people were happy. the pool bar was affordable and busy without too long of a delay on getting drinks.   the rooms of the hotel have a real modern retro feel from the large bathrooms with color changing frosted glass to the cabinetry and furniture. one of the rooms had a spectacular patio view of the pool and i was able to grab a picture of it lit up against the darkness of the night. i sat out on the patio for a good hour just enjoying the night sky and randomly viewable stars in the sky. great experience over all. definitely memorable and i doubt i will forget it any time soon.

i love sprouts and their bulk food bins. granola...yum.  sprouts also has a really good deli and sandwich counter when you can check off items from a tear pad and they will make your sandwich to order. plus a little nook to eat in.  the produce is always good, and the prices are better then larger chain stores. vitamin selection is huge, and i can always get a box of my favorite Emer'genC there.  the meat selection is good, and they have bomb shish-ka-bobs too. the sausage is really good too, hot turkey for ma spaghetti sauce. yup yum.  i honestly wish there was a sprouts closer to me. but i cant have everything. :(

i love Lenny's burgers. i used to live over on 15th ave and camelback when i was about twelvish. and at the time there was a Lenny's up the street. my mom would pick up burgers from there about twice a month...that location is long gone.  i was super stoked when this one opened up. i kept seeing the opening soon sign thinking, "this shit better open up soon, i got a craving" well it did open..but by the time it did i forgot all about lenny's.   a year or so after it opened i finally got my fix and it was amazing..all that i remember as a yut. ranch burger with cheese please. YES!!!  the decor is cool too..i just wish this damn place was open on the weekends and late at night. i would tear this shit up like a pack a wolves do campers.    ohh i'm the first vote for "No" on "Good for Kids" i honestly do not think children should be eating this much cholesterol but that is the only reason for the No. lol

honestly it does not deserve 4 stars...yet.  i've ridden this thing like 5 times total. and on each of the 5 rides i have seen the same asshole sitting in  a seat. must be fucking nice to sit on said train all day for the last 5 days its been running. how about you get your seat hogging ass off the fucking train and let someone else sit down.  still apparently on the honor system, i have yet to see one of these mystery security personnel checking for tickets or receipts. how long do you give before phoenix smartens the fuck up and puts up the chain link fences and guardrails so people must purchase a ticket before they can enter the platform area? umm..hello??  semi smooth ride, much better then standing on a city bus..where a bus driver can casually throw your standing ass all over the eisles while he guns the gas and then slams on the brakes. i didn't realize drifting a bus was possible. but i can swear to the fact it's possible.  i'll keep giving this thing a chance. i'm sure it's nice when it's not crowded.

Morning Ritual...get fair trade, smoke cig, wait for car pool.   i have been holding off reviewing fair trade for a very long time...where once i felt it was pretentious and kinda uppity with it's social politics...i have since embraced this jewel and really love the people who work here. every morning i get greeted and for the most part they know what i want and it simplifies everything.  first i don't get all picky with what i get, it's a large drip every morning. i usually steer for Medium Roast..but for the most part i like what i get..dark or medium..so i stopped specifying. it is just good so why complicate things with being picky.  Fair Trade also gives out discounts for RS residents, Gov. employees, students, and seniors. as a resident of the apartment "complex" fair trade is in. i get my resident discount..i think it's 10%. which is nice because it brings the cost down below 2 bucks for a large coffee..i then feel more justified with the 1 dollar tip i usually leave.   1 star for good coffee  1 star for great employees  1 star for location  1 star for prices  1 star for convenience  ahhh i feel better now.

Melrose Pharmacy is one of those really cute diamonds in the cenpho area. i stopped in here on the last melrose block party with some friends, one needed to get a percription filled and we saw this place and said "yup lets try it" it was soooo cool. lots of little wind up toys and books and other typical pharmacy type items stocked on what looked like 5ft book shelves. the pharmacist was really nice, chatty, and helpful to my friends needs. filled her script in 10 minutes while we milled around the store. they even accept a wide selection of insurances and everything was nothing more then a pleasant experience...i almost wish something was wrong with me so i could have a perscription to fill too. oh well. when i do i will be taking it here for sure. 5 stars for just awesomeness.

Wow was my first uttered breath as i reached the summit of a 37 floor elevator climb. now this isn't the tallest building i have been in..but it is the tallest here. i stepped out of the elevator and walked over to one of the windows that looks out over the city..holy shit..i can see my house from here. well i could. :)   how did i get here? well....  i was with a group of friends at the Heritage Square tip off party for the All Star game in phoenix. we just closed down the bars at the square and were walking past the chase building on our way back to cars and train stations...respectivly. as we walked past a group of nicely dressed individuals...one called out the name of a person in our group..turns out this individual was some muckity muck at city hall...we got handed some "passes"..we looked at each other..."fuck it" was quoted and we headed over to check in. next step...ontop of the world.   the accommodations are nice...the room was cleared of tables and it was basically a dance floor and some stand up tables. cash only bar..with HEAVY drinks..i ordered a Manhatten...the bar tender said.."i'm out of vermouth"...i said "umm ok" he said "i can make it with just bourbon and cherry juice" i said "umm ok"..so he poured a splash of cherry juice into a 12ounce glass put in a few ice cubes..and filled the glass with bourbon...wtf. let me say..it was good..for being straight bourbon with a splash of cherry juice. eleven bucks plus a heavy fade from free drinking at Heritage Square... i was good.   i got some pretty cool pictures of the city at night..i'll post them when i find time.   if you get a chance to come here..i suggest you do it. it's really something else.

this is my favorite big box theatre..it is in walking distance and is always empty. but when its not empty, its just as fun. i've seen cops drag people out of shows, and i've seen people fighting in the lobby.   i also love the crippled guy that works here, he's really nice if you talk to him. and he reminds me of my long dead uncle who grew up with polio..sad. but he seems happy so i'm happy.  i roll up to the Keosk grab my tickets and go. not even sure why they never seem to be getting any use. oh well. makes it easy for me.

i love the Root. one of the nicest salons in the uptown area. owner/operator is Lauren Hart. Lauren has been in the business for a long time and has a serious loyal following of clients. the shop is always beautiful, clean and bright. artwork hanging on the walls from local artist. artwork changes so i won't go into the artists.  pricing is in the upper range. this is not supercuts.   the hairstylists are all experienced and skilled at what they do. the staff always have big smiles. i'm sure Lauren is great to work for.

i figured it was about time i update my review of the root. i was just in the shop Saturday for my semi monthy do-do. Rox was nice enough to squeeze me in with a color job before her next client came in. i was super stoked because i was starting to show my true colors. no. not a jackass. my hair color. calm down already.   she gave me a quick scalp cleansing and trimmed up my shaggy fro before applying some rich golden chocolate brown color. then i was off to the dryer. cold chilling in one of those clear Louis arm chairs from DWR, i say cold chilling, even tho my scalp area was quite warm under the heaters. i caught up on my facebook from my phone. watched Roxanne color her next clients hair, then i was off to the super cozy wash basins for a rinsing. i'll stop boring you with a play by play of my hair experiance.   i just need to say that my experiance is always great and the lovely staff of the Root always takes care of me. it was Roxannes birthday and there was cake for the customers to enjoy.  cake + great service + hair skill = 5 stars.  make an appointment for yourself.

Just because i feel like doing something different. :P i'm just going to paste some song lyrics that i feel sum up Pei Wei on McDowell...  Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here I said the truth is here the truth is here  I want more Give me more We want more God damn it I'm back to demand we get more We want more I want more and more and more I want more We need more I want more God damn it I'm back to demand we get more Give me more I want more and more and more  [Verse 1:] I stand here naked as the day I was born Face to the dawn and my faith in the song Blood soaking the pages I painted em' on And none of ya'll will take my place when I'm gone I'm the pure raw uncut, who the fuck want what Here to show you sucker ass mutts what's the fucks what Brother Ali vow solemnly not to die while the music is still inside of me It's got to be allowed to breathe Got to let it out enough at least to let the monster flee I want more than what your offering me Songs that make me feel like I'm already free I'm a rebel in my own right Ya'll don't want to write or think or speak a rhyme standing next to me When the game need it I'm exactly what it need Put the soul in the speech, let it go, let it be  [Chorus: x2] I want more We need more I want, god damn it I'm back to demand we get more Give me more I want more and more and more  I said the truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is  [Verse 2:] Not nearly a single solitary soul Still put the kind of passion to the mic that I hold One day it'll have to be pried from my cold dead hand Until then the big man is gold Got one lone reason to go on breathing Climb into the zone of the evening, keep reaching Just to pull more out the core of the deamon The people need to see them pure human being Blood, sweat, love, hate, life, death, joy, pain Little child running wild striped to the raw veins Rugged junkyard dog off the chain, barefoot balls out marching in the rain Sacred war dance suspended in the moment We throw the fuck down like our lives depended on it Jaws of the streets with our heart on our sleeve Throwing shots at the law which is all I believe  [Chorus x2]  [Verse 3:] Our songs are supposed to be the voice of our soul Not bought and sold, not all controlled Bring a little fire when the world get cold Let me shed a few tears and to me you went gold People need more freedom Children need to hear more truth when ya'll teach em' Damn I want to hear a plan from the dude preaching Got new seeds with true needs and who's leading I truly believe every word I've ever uttered on a drum break Right or wrong, life go on but it wasn't nothing fake I demand you start listening to the crowd If not - we gon burn this bitch to the ground  [Chorus x2]  I said the truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is   the atmosphere is pretty hot here too..exposed brick always makes me Yelp!

Stopped in on the Yelp Office hours because it's fairly close to where i work. nice little coffee shop. i ordered an iced americano and the espresso didn't taste burnt or bitter.   also in attendance this day was blue belle ice cream. delish new flavor.   if your in the area, check it out.

i like Switch, the long European style bar is great for a large group of friends or making new friends. the food is pretty good. happy hour is awesome with the 2 for 1 Sangrias and glasses of wine.  plus they make a really good Caipirinha. which i believe to be a better version of the Mojito.  atmosphere is cute and friendly. inviting. staff is usually attentive. only had one bad experiance..but i just notch it up to how busy it was. no foul. i will keep coming back.

oK, first i broke my promise to myself and went here again, i figured by now things have got to be better. i ordered something that i wouldn't care if it was cold, French Toast. ok so the french toast is good. but it wasn't worth waiting 40 fucking minutes to get it. and on top of it. my friends food was cold again. one of them would rather eat glass then eat at this place so refused to order a cold meal, but since my other friend was paying she said fuck it i'll go.  well she ordered toast and some sausage as sides. and my other friend ordered the mish mash, his review of the place is more generious then mine, but he's only been there once and said it wasn't so bad. lol.  so anyways toast, soo cold the butter couldn't even melt. and cold sausage to boot. the friend with the mishmash, lol. i saw the bottom of the bowl and it was all a weird watery substance at the bottom. how hard is it to drain poached eggs before dumping them in a bowl?  i was going to give palatte 3 stars based on the french toast, but it was hardly warm. i so badly want to like this place cause it's close and Matt's is always packed.  can i please get a breakfast place in the roosevelt area that is large enough to seat more then 20 people and serves good breakfast?

i like the clubhouse, i've seen some really memorable shows here.   thankfully i remember the performance more then anything else about this venue. umm. the bathroom is usually pretty gross. but thats what happens when it's 1 toilet per sex for 600 people. duh!!  thankfully this place is close to a 7/11 so i can pick up a 40 and drink in the parking lot. and then go back into the show with a crotch full of 50ml shots of bacardi or something similar.  5 stars when the bathroom doesn't look like cambodia.

Mel's Diner.   i had to give it a try, a schoolmate once told me it was a good breakfast, and a teacher concurred. i never went. but for some reason i wanted to go. so myself and 2 friends gave it a shot.  i was quite shocked by what i saw, and i told my friends, who are now getting sketched out by the place, "remember, i heard it was good."  i didn't read a yelper's review of this place so i wasn't aware of the umm decor. holy crap what a sewer of a diner. the carpeting as described by others is horrid. i compare it to what you might expect of a homeless shelter. or at least a squatter house.  the attire of the waitresses was right on target with another yelper review. i couldn't imagine we went at the same day. so i guess it's the norm. think skanky truck stop hooker. and no not the child prostitute hookers. she was a lovely waitress, not nearly as bad as others have described. she was fairly cheerful and very helpful. i did not see the surly busser. but a sweet Hispanic lady was pouring coffee..i couldn't understand her, but only because she spoke very softly. love the misc. coffee mugs of random design.   i ordered an omelet with sausage, i asked what kind of sausage comes in it, and she asked what kind would i like. :D WOW. a choice? i chose patty sausage because i cannot stand sausage links chopped up into an omelet. i just hate it. this was great. i was entirely pleased with the omelet. i also got hash-browns and sourdough toast.  hash browns needed seasoning, just like all potatoes. i quickly aided my hash browns with the remedy. salt. toast was covered with margarine. eh. not a fan of that. but it was fine with grape jelly. :)  my two friends ordered 1 egg with bacon. the kicker and you would think this would annoy a waitress. one friend ordered food 15 minutes after my other friend and i ordered. we even already had the bill. lol. she took the bill and made the corrections without anything that was even remotely ill temper. not quite as described by other yelpers.  i give this place the 4 stars because the food is actually really good. and i enjoy the scum of the earth shit-hole restaurants. ONLY if the food is good. and to be honest. my omelet was better then any omelet i got at the Biltmore or the Princess. it wasn't super oily and it was simple and well executed. i will definitely be returning. maybe after a tetanus shot so I'm inoculated against fly :)  cost was cheap cheap. 3 people with moderate breakfast orders. under 20 bucks.

this place has a really nice bathroom. honestly that is all i remember. i was very very very drunk. i don't even think i meant to go in here. but they let me in after checking my ID. didn't mind i was stumbling all over the place. once i made it to the restroom, i pee'd all over the wall. stumbled back out and wondered where i was. Tempe Marketplace? how the hell did i get here???

the first time i stepped into this building was 20 years ago, i believe it was called Marven Gardens and it was a diner. i had grits. i was 8.   many years and many diners have come and gone. never a "real" restaurant in that time. so Thai Hut goes up and I've been told its delish.   everyone there is full of smiles and greet you when you enter the door with a hand sign of "how many people?", 2 fingers up, you nod, and your seated. simple. words are overrated anyways.   slide into a booth and within a few minutes you have very large cups of water and someone taking your drink order. our waitress had the cutest face, reminded me of Raven Simone from the Cosby show.   Pad Thai is pretty good, the Pad Cee Eww was good, a little light on the sauce. pepper steak was good. the ginger dish from the specialties is very good. sauce is thin. but the flavor is there.  all the vegetables in their dishes are crisp and very bright. no mushy vegetables.  everything I've had is good...except, the orange chicken. avoid at all costs. I'm used to a sauce made from orange or mandarin peals. this orange chicken is...flavored with a Hi-C reduction or Tang. its fucking sick. i got it for take out. almost killed me. i will never make that mistake again.     i will certainly keep going back.

as we move into the future there will be two things. Target and Wal-Mart.  everything else will cease to exist. even roaches will die off before these two megaliths. the biggest difference i first notice between the two..cleanliness Super Target is spotless. the produce area is sparkling and the refrigerated fruit bins are wood accented. like wtf. they look better then some craftsmen kitchens. the isles are wide and bright, and void of clutter. food prices are equal to walmart. I've read reports that confirm this comment. i think one of the reasons this place is so clean..all the disgusting dirty people are still at wal-mart.  i fear things will change when the overwhelming hordes of the poverty stricken realize that super target is the same price. but for now super target is the cleanest.  moving over to checkout, i noticed another difference between walmart and super target. i got in line and there wasn't a line. walmart. i expect to stand in line for 20 minutes. and do. that could be because all those people are still at walmart instead of super target...hmm. could be.  last comment regarding the difference between wal-mart and target. the employees. i think they have a heigene pre-qualifier at super target, and all teeth are required. next the obvious proper grooming before coming in to work. everyone looked like they had showered that month. i cannot say the same for walmart employees. i have been torn asunder in shock by some walmart employees. WTF is wrong with you people. don't fucking smile if your missing teeth. ok. sorry cyber-terrets syndrome here.

to be honest i'll preface this review to only be about one thing..ok well maybe two things. the Toddy Coffee and the Vegan Donuts   i love you.  i am absolutely in love with you.  typically i order an iced americano and then fill it up with stevia sweetener till my hearts content, and then enough organic half and half to change my coffees complexion to reflect halle berry. but the toddy i purchased at conspire was 1000% perfect just with ice.   merry me.

Bomberos, a Norwegian based group, playing what they like to call "obscene, disgusting punk", was formed in 2002......  ooops my bad, Bomberos are Fire Fighters in Chilie...incidently my second favorite south american country..  stopped here for Chrissy's surprise birthday party hosted by the fabuloso Amber and Teh "Cool Kids"...so what is my take on Bomberos? well i found it to be very comfortable, i feel kinda lame to write a review on a "Cafe & Wine Bar" if i didn't actually eat or drink anything. but the environment alone deserves 4 stars. it is truely an enchanting spot. everything they served looked awesome and there was nothing but Hmmmm's and "Yumm" and from the previous reviews i tend to believe that most of them are not over exagerated.  i look forward to returning sometime soon.  for what i consider to be outer limits of my bubble, it's certainly not off limits. i will let Bomberos put out my fire any time. as long as it's with a nice Chilean Lager.

7 dollar cover for this? hahahaha. it's really a shame.  parking, boo, decorations, boo, no cards at the bar??? seriously?? wtf., Booo. most of the black guys i saw here had their snowflakes. cute. it's like the human embodiment of a pimp cane. accessory for the oh so rich. or want to look rich. whatever. majority of the clientele was in their 50's, which since i am no where close to that age. its not my thing. some of the women strolling this place were by far older then the men, and in fact this one old bag purposefully bumped into me. or she was that drunk. either way i checked for my wallet afterwards. lol.  parking was horrible. the door man kinda gave me the creeps with his long leather jacket and insistence on shaking my hand..and the eagerness to shove a flyer in my hand as i was already halfway out the door. i kinda like jazz, groove and funk. but this place also served up a healthy dose of grope, gawk, and funk..not of the musical variety.  i can say i will not be returning here. it just didn't really offer any appeal to me. but at least i gave it a chance.   my expectations were already low since i knew this place used to be Fat Cats, and you could score some crack rock in the parking lot faster then you could catch yourself if you tripped. i suspect the same can still be obtained, but i think they had the dealers checked to stay in their car...because i did spot a couple sitting in their cutlass in the parking lot. sketch.  so to sum it up,   bring cash, and enough of it don't park, try to magically fly here.  bring your grandma, she'll have a blast. score some rock  yelp.

was craving Thai food and while my options are now abundant i figured i would check out Thai Elephant. heck it's not that far off the Dash line and the dash circles around my 'hood now so why not.  dinner for 2 reasonably priced and HOLY BASIL it was good. OK lame jokes aside. the food was very good. portions are enough to feed you twice and the flavors are off the charts. we split an order of Pad Z U, Pad (something i forgot) the Satay Chicken skewers and the vegetable rolls.  the tamarind dipping sauce for the satay...excellent. the Pad ZU excellent. slightly sweet and decently spicy (i got medium)  the dipping sauce for the vegetable rolls was a sweet peanut sauce. very tasty. the other pad dish was excellent as well. wish i could remember its name.  pricing is affordable. considering the portions it's perfect.  the dining area is quaint and very comfortable. but if you have more then 5 people it might be hard to get seating if the place is busy.  check it out, thumbs up.

running into Tommy tonight was awesome. after the first time here i wasn't sure if it was the place he opened, but now its confirmed it is. and i'm happy to support any establesment that Tommy is behind, because he is one good guy. from my converstaion i assertained that every bartender is Irish born, which from our conversation is unique to Tim FInnegans. hats off to that. if i could find a swedish bar with 100% swed born bartenders i would be into that. but lets face it, the sweds arent exactly known for their beer or whiskey. so it is what it is.  i wish Tommy the best with his place and hope nothing but the best for him. the Yelp party was a great success. i'll drop in more if i'm in the area.   i hope the Douchery doesn't infest this place as i previously predicted. Tommy assured me it wasn't the clientel he was looking for. so i'm crossing my fingers.

i'm kinda surprised i am writing this. i know i wrote this review before but it says "write a review" so i'm going on memory. the food was great, we sat outside, table of 4, it was a beautiful day. i ordered the plantain spring rolls and the main dish escapes me. but it was fantastic. i was super happy with my food. i raved about it to friends. which leaves me perplexed why i am sitting here now 3 months later writing this review. lol. desert is amazing..so is the coffee. i'm not even sure why i have not been back since my last visit. :-/ i need to get my shit together.

Thai Basil was a good addition to Park Central. this neglected mall is a ghost town at night. I'm sure Thai Basil can do  good business off the assorted Club Central crowd, as either a before or post happy hour eatery. Open till 9pm on Saturday is good for me too.   the Menu is typical Thai fare. the spring rolls i really enjoyed. they have yellow corn stuffed in side. i was quite surprised by it. I'm used to cabbage, clear rice noodles and various carrots, but CORN!! it was freaking delish. the dipping sauce was accompanied by a small salad.  i ordered Red Currey (Medium Spice) it was very flavorful..but..medium?. i didn't notice any heat. not like in a mild. but like a missing heat. next time I'm going hot. and i pray they deliver the goods. i want scorching. tongue tingling action here.  my homegirl got Garlic Vegetable with chicken, (Mild) we both figured go weak on this one cause she's not a hot person. and if it was weak. toss on some chili sauce. so..yea chili sauce was added.  the flavors were on point. garlicky and full of taste. not often do you see green beans in Asian food. i think the playful touches add allot.   like David S.B. noticed in his review. Thai Elephant was much hotter. if these two restaurants are indeed related. i wonder why the flavor variations??  the decor is also quite different. there was only one image on the wall. and it looked like a WW2 Era picture of a family member who was serving in the Thai Liberation army or something. (i just made that up) which is a juxtaposition of most Thai restaurants i have been to which have random Buddhist idols and what-nots. honestly i like the change up.  total on the bill for two entrees and an order of spring rolls was 36.Change which is pretty good.  if Thai Basil and Thai Elephant are related. i think they have little twists that make each place different. i look forward to returning.   there was a party of about 8-9 when we arrived, which at the time we got there. they were the only other people in the restaurant. so i think this place is good for groups...as of now. when this place picks up in popularity..i don't think it would be all that comfortable with a large group..inside. outside will be great. lots of ceiling fans to keep the area cool.

Why is it that the best places are a little hard to find? In a little bit of a sketched out area? Some people call them diamonds in the rough. I would just call them restaurants in phoenix.   Sunday I went to Pizza A Metro. I haven't been to this side of town in awhile. I'm CenPho and I hardly ever venture outside my hood. But I keep hearing how great this place is and was feelin some pizza.   First thing I noticed when I entered the door...I've seen larger hot dog carts. The atmosphere is super cozy, seating is comfortable and we didn't need to wait long. Already three good things right?   Looked over the menu and listened to the daily specials.  We opted for the soup of the day, a Caesar salad, some fried calamari and a small pizza.  We were not looking to gorge, but definitely wanted to try different things from the menu.  Soup of the day was OMG delicious. It was like a frittata in a bowl of soup. Scrambled eggs, spinach, in a chicken broth with sliced meatballs.  I almost cleaned the bowl. It was insanely good.  Caesar Salad was awesome. Crispy lettuce not overly dressed. A very good salad.  The fried calamari was excellent. Not overly fried, lightly battered and golden fried. Not too dark, not too crunchy. Dipping sauce was good, but found just some lemon and they were awesome.  We ordered a small pizza and it had artichoke, olives, cheese, ham and it was awesome.  After all the rest of the food I ate, just had a few small slices and took the rest home.   Everything was wonderful. I give this place 6 stars. But since 5 is the max...deal with it.

Yum Yum Yum. went out to dinner with my roomie and figured we would get some ice cream at Pink Spot on the way back downtown. the place is hyper-pink in a sugery to the eyes way.   we both got a scoop in a cup, because the cones looked large..and i wanted to try the ice cream..not make a meal of it. i got Chocolate Peanut-Butter....well because i love peanuts. whole, halved, mashed into butter, stuffed into cup, umm. or frozen with chocolate ice cream. yay! my roomie got PIstachio. she said it was good, and i tried it. wow she was right it was good. the pistachios were good. i don't know if Egyptian Pistachios are different then the ones you can get at sprouts. but it was damn good.  we sat outside and it was nice out. 2 cups of ice cream, 6 bucks. i don't feel robbed or disappointed. just satisfied.  i give it a thumbs up, and 4 stars.

I've been to the fresh and easy up on baseline once to pick up some wine before a dinner party. was a cute little California implant (no not plastic knockers) i was intrigued. so i saw they were building one in my stretch of land. i vowed to make an effort to head that far uptown. so today i did.   i really like F&E, the design is amazing, the store layout amazing. the package branding is awesome. i understand what many people are saying with the plastic packaging seems very wasteful for a "green"like company. but i think considering there is only self checkout, it is meant to speed up the shopping process. I'm not an idiot, but i too can become frustrated with the checkout process if i have a bag full of peaches and I'm trying to look it up on a screen via P for peaches, look for picture, click picture and hope the scale is accurate. agh!! lose my  mind. a plastic tray with peaches slide it over barcode reader. woot. Fresh...and Easy too. i respect this process. i think remove the snot nosed check out stand person, and you can save money, and lower your prices. I'm a fan.  now i see a fair number of reviews for the F&E branded food. i didn't do big shopping here. i bought 5lbs of chicken for 7 bucks total. legs and thighs for some home made dry rub BBQ chicken. i was very happy with the prices and the quality looks good. very clean chicken.  i will return to try more of the F&E branded items and re-review at a later date. peece.

i needed to update my review as i have been going to Fresh and Easy alot more.  the Fresh and Easy brand of products are pretty good. i've had some of the spagetti sauces, the bread, the potato chips, the juices, the chicken and meat.  everything has been awesome. i have no complaints about fresh and easy.  i think it's fantastic. one of my favorite deals is the Large bar of chocolate. 3.50 for like a 2 lb block. it's great for breaking off a little piece here and there. for the price comparison...what is that...10 hershys' bars in weight for 3.50 lol. its a good deal.

still lovin' it.  the frozen mini pizzas are pretty good. and 3 for 5 it's a pretty good deal.  i have never really been disappointed here. never. i guess i just don't care about the anti-union labor employees. they are super friendly. one offered to throw away my empty coffee cup, another offered to go get me a bag of ice, and another even bagged my haul. 3 different employees mind you. so i guess it's come a long way from there only being 1 employee in the whole store. so i hope some of you weirdos who complain about that come back.

yea i'm a fan of SAS, not because i sew, but because this is my favorite russian bride hang out. just kidding. but i think you have been shopping here for awhile you will get that joke.  i occasionally make books, so i always pick up fabrics from SAS, they are cheap as all get out, and the quality on some of it is pretty good.  it's like the Ross of fabric stores, the overhead is really low, and nothing is sorted..well...and the quality ranges from good to bad, with the occasional, wow. both good and bad. lots of little things like buttons and other neccesitys for that baptism dress, or the prom...or umm. a wedding. cool place..even with no AC.

to date, i have been to Sens twice now, oddly enough as a guest to two of the bartenders at the Turf. was drinking on a Saturday night when one of the bartenders who was off the clock was hanging out, asked if i wanted to head over to Sens and grab a bite to eat. i obviously said "Yes" so we walked across the hallway and up to the bar, it was 2:25 or so and the kitchen staff was cleaning up, she asked if the kitchen was closed or if they can still serve food, we got a nod of approval and quickly put in an order, two plates of the Duck+Mint+Ginger salad, an order of Soup Gyoza and Shu Mai. everything was excellent, the Duck salad is amazing 5 stars for sure. the dumplings were both excellent as well. the graciousness of bar waitress and the kitchen staff was amazing considering the time.   second time eating at Sens, was not quite harmonious. i was asked previously to my first visit if i wanted to try sens, and while neither myself or the bartender requesting my presence had been here yet, i agreed and we agreed upon a time and date where she would be off work around the same time i would get home from work.  we headed over to Sens, now at this point I've already had some experience with the menu and the food, plus I'm not a stranger to asian food. this time i ordered the Soup Gyoza, Fried Tofu and the Sugar Cane, my accompaniment tried the Miso with shrimp.  now this is where i cannot justify a 5th star....  i received all 3 of my dishes before they even started her Miso soup. :(  i held off eating while we both waited for her food, i offered some of my selections as it was enough to share and still be happy with it. but it still didn't put off the annoyance of not having your own dish in front of you. it was finally served a long 8 minutes later, roughly, and she liked it. only complaint beyond the delay was that the shrimp were a little overcooked.  all in all good experiences for trying something fairly new. I'll certainly return, price wasn't all that bad and the drinks are pretty good. but nothing i would go there for strictly. I'm not a huge fan of sake or vodka. they do have other things to pore, but the drink specialties are all sake or vodka. :\

Hanny's is two things..and neither at full potential.  1st, it is very chic and modern in a retro feel. as far the the interior style and potential i give it 5 stars. i was told the basement will be a full blown dance club in the future. but for now..this place is completely underused. there is a second bar upstairs, but on a friday night i counted more open tables then filled ones..so clearly the second bar is premature.  2nd, the pizza tastes good, the flavor i thought was there. but give me a fucking break, 17 bucks for a crispy saltine baked at 600 degrees with some toppings...  drinks were strong..saving grace on the menu side of this review. but i think the pricing is seriously out of wack for what you get.  no free birthday dessert...better and lesser places have no problem doing this. hell if i was a server..i would have compped it either way..it was a table of 10 people drinking and my tip alone was 40 bucks. not to mention the unrequested table bread....that was put on my bill..WHAT THE FUCK!!!   it will be awhile before i come back to Hanny's  like i said the potential for a 5 star awesome place is there. but seriously the clown menu needs some revisions..if you want to charge this much for dining, get a real menu deserving of it. hopefully the wait staff too. at one point in the night i saw 3 servers standing around by the main entrance. look busy asshole.    coolest thing would be the DJ nest over the dining area. also the bathrooms, which i believe used to be dressing rooms. i can totally see some awesome carnal experiances in these private bathrooms. but i think it's kinda weird the bathrooms are 20 feet from the upstairs bar..and in line of sight...  Hanny's i wish you the best..and hope you can grow up to be what you want to be. send me a kite when you do..i look forward to hearing from you.

when i was in high school a friend of mine worked here. one day while at work he was bored and put his boot in the fryer. lol. it melted his heel. i remember the food being decent at best and the location was pure scary. i also heard a urban myth about this place. Ed and Pete were close friends and they both had a fish an chip place, and they were partners. Pete wanted to expand, Ed didn't, Ed ended up dead. murdered under suspicious cercumstances...then Pete opened up a few other shops...now you see Pete all over the valley..and Ed just gets a crappy review from me.   i wonder how much of the above is true. i'm too lazy to look up police records to confirm it. but none the less. a great phoenix foodie urban myth.

if you know me from the talk threads then you will know i have been waiting on this place for a long time. so i broke my side bar cherry last night and walked over. got there around 11:30 and it was mildly busy, the bar was fully loaded with people and the lounge area was only occupied by one group of 8-9 in a corner. i was meeting Laura R and her sister for some fun and she asked me to get there ahead and get a table for 3. well...that wasn't a problem. i sat down relaxed a minute and the music was a nice volume..i could hear myself think right...well by the end of the night the music variety was all over the map, and the volume followed suit. there was time where i could not hear the person next to me, and it annoyed me.  the beer selection is good, lots of bottles, but they didn't really have the micro brew selection i was hoping for. it kinda seemed like they raided safeways beer selection, PBR, Miller, Coors, "Domestic Lager" section was large. not much local.  and i think the IPA and Wheat beer selection was too small, Wheat beer is very popular right now, 5 choices seemed odd  i've noticed a few reviews of pricing oddities...well here is mine. i got 1 beer. i wasn't really thinking of getting drunk, just wanted to check out the place with good company. it was 5 bucks, Laura and her sis had 2 each, and paid 10. lol. i seriously need to get a vagina. wtf is that. lol.  oh well pretty girls should be allowed to get away with that, so i'm not mad.   i will deffinetly go back here. it's a short 15 minute walk from my apartment and the weather is nice out.   atmosphere of the bar is really cute, Ikea'ish for sure. the lounge was all high back booths and small round coffee tables and some pseudo design within reach white modern chairs and bubble-gumdrop ambient light. the bar is well lit which is a nice contrast to the lounge, which is not lit. i used my cellphone to read the beer menu. its the perfect hook up bar.

i had a good time here Thursday, saw Evidence from Dilated Peoples, it was also his birthday celebration so the place was ape shit. drink prices were right, and door charge was 10 bucks. i would have paid more to see evidence, and have lol.  blunt club is something of a resident of Club Red and it's every thursday  night and is a hip-hop venue.  quoted from the myspace page "Over the span of a 6.75 years, The Blunt Club  has accomplished what all party organizers dream of: hordes of beautiful young people losing it on their dance floors, unparalleled street cred, a party circuit that now extends throughout Arizona & California, and resident DJs that are booked at countless club parties throughout United States. The path was not paved with diamonds, guns, big name international DJs and glossy towel-sized flyers, nor with a website or message board to call their own, but simply by enthusiastic word-of-mouth promotion among an ever growing, always receptive circle of friends and acquaintances... peers, if you will....... Thanks to everyone that helped me & the crew make this shit happen over the last five and a half years, and all of the thousands of groups that graced our stage and felt the vibe! Here's to the next 7! Dumperfoo "  i would highly encourage you to check out a show at the blunt club. i had alot of fun. 5 stars if they owned the building. lol.

i will not even pretend to know what west african food tastes like. i read a blurb about what countries west africa encompasses and how southern cooking has heritage from west african cooking.  next i'm not from the south so i will not pretend to know what good southern food is either. lastly from looking at what countries west africa is i can say on a positive note the chef/owner still has all his limbs and was more then likely NOT from Sierra Leon. that's only my speculation really..he might have been a lucky guy.  so again not knowing what good west african Cuisine i will not go into some sort of diatribe about how authentic it was or how it was shit because "i lived in west africa for a period". what i had i felt was a good meal. i left full and happy.   i was part of a large party of yelpers who in a way sprung ourselves upon the helpless gazelle that is Bantu Bistro like that hungry Lion which is Yelp. the party was about 15 people give or take a few and people started showing up around the designated 6:30 agreed upon meeting time. drinks orders were taken..albeit a bit shaky to start with, the gentlemen who served us seem way out of his comfort zone and was not aware of what beer or wine was available..and since there was no drink menu we all felt that we kinda just had to wing it on beverage requests.  after a while of getting all the drinks requested and everyone finally showing up. we all browsed the menu, asked whatever questions we could come up with and settled on our meals. the server took our orders and again..made the best of the situation.  about 30 minutes later everyone was chatting each other up and food started to come out. here and there of "who ordered the (insert dinner)" or "which meal did you have" "who had (insert side dish)" finally it seamed as everyone had food in front of them and people started to eat.   i ordered the curried Goat with a side of FuFu and Plantains.. now i'm not really sure what the hell FuFu is, but all i could think of was Cream of Wheat from a box i had as a child. it was good with my meal, but absolutely tasteless on its own. which i'm not sure how your supposed to eat it anyways. i liked the curried goat. it was basically a stew of goat meat and some vegetables in a curry sauce. not exactly a pantheon of flavors and it certainly was not spicy. but i found it to be comforting and made me feel good inside. plus it's not often i get to eat goat. so the new experience put a smile on my face.  i cannot in fairness rate my experience on the service. they were clearly overwhelmed with the size of our group and the business seems like they are still on training wheels. as the only people in the restaurant for the majority of our stay we did have full attention of the staff which was attentive. thank you.   thank you Dottsy for the UYE  it was nice to meet Bacon Robert M Heather C Terry T Maggie (husband Eric) Scott W Jason W David SB  it was nice to see again Julie P Matthew Ayesha Kevin (after dinner) and of course Dottsy   i honestly hope this place does well. this building has seen way too many tenants fail. i would like to see one success.  good luck Bantu.   Sincearly, Arik.  PS. the average meal price was $11. so really not that unreasonable. thumbs up.

this post office has been a favorite of mine for many a year. but since they started routing my undeliverable packages to the fucking Van Buren Post Office i have been pissed off. i do not know why i need to go so god damn far just to find out i got a new chotchkey from Camel that was too big to fit in my mail box. waste my time. i want a refund..maybe even a complimentary roll of stamps.  probably one of the cooler post offices to get a PO Box at..except you will have no access to your mail after 6pm.   i have to rate it 2 stars simply on the fact it USED to be better. now it's only Meh!

"It's not about where you've been...it's about where you're at." - Eric B & Rakim   Saturday night was the 4 year anniversary of "the Shop".   if you dont know what the shop is, well the Shop is basicly a pseudo club on the left side of the Hidden House. it is in the now extinct bruno mali restaurant. which from what i've been told went extinct after the shop was having success and the bars owners felt it was a better investment to just close the restaurant and just serve food to the Hidden House Patrons..i think it was a successful gamble.  the shop has been under the wing of DJ Al Page who has been hand picking DJ's to play classic Hip-Hop , Underground, Funk, Soul, R&B, Dancehall, Raggae, and Neo Soul. Al Page has managed to keep the party going Friday, Saturday  9pm till close. i hear stuff is usually poppin on Sunday and Monday nights too..   you can expect to hear music from Atmosphere, Beastie Boys, RUN DMC, Pharcyde, Black Sheep, Lifesavas, Lyrics Born, A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, Blackalicious, KRS-1, DJ Shadow, Pharoahe Monch, Common, The Roots, Jigmastas, Wu Tang, Dilated Peoples, Jurrasic 5, Aesop Rock, Del the Funky Homosapien, Moka Only, Brother Ali, Hieroglyphics, Brand Numian, Slum Village, Immortal Technique, Quannum Spectrum, Handsome Boy Modeling school, Diverse, RJD2, Eyedea & Abilities, Pigeon John, Black Michael Jackson, Dan the Automater, the Beatnuts, Buck 65, the Procussions, Public Enemy, Cunninlynguists, Outkast, Nextmen, Anti-Pop Consortium, Mos Def, Marvin Gaye, Prince Paul, Erykah Badu, Prince, Al Green, Bob Marley, Afu-Ra, Soul Position, DJ Numark, Portishead, Soul 2 Soul, ODB, Biz Markie, Malcolm Mclaren, Art of Noise, Digable Planets, Just Ice, Afrika Bambata & Soul Sonic Force, Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five, Mantronix, 3rd Bass, Whodini, Biggie Smalls, Jeru the Damaja, Craig Mack, Sugar Hill Gang, Stevie Wonder, Old LL Cool J, Funkadelic, Parliament....and similar shit.  cover charge is usually 5 bucks and it's a cash only bar on the Shop side. but seriously its worth it. the drinks are cheap and the beats are sick.  i took a break from the shop as a long time regular..but i figured i would come in and check out the 4 year anniversary party and the place was jumping from 9 till close. got smashed drunk on 20 bucks.

i'm giving turf 4 stars for now, i expect 5 stars will be on a follow up.  first time here and i have to say i already love the place, its within a 7 minute walk from my apartment and that is something i have been dreaming of since i first signed a lease. my only full bar options are Portlands (meh) and carley's (good god no!!) and the bikini (way too far to stumble home, and HIPSTER) and sidebar (close, but not really stumble home close). so here i am meeting my roomie for drinks after work, i walk in and wow. i expected allot worse from the reviews from John V and Pierre.   let me correct the misconceptions, its not in any way empty space, yes it's not overly crowded (yet) but i had a mental picture of the brickhouse empty. it is nothing like that. the floor plan is laid out with seating for sit down comfort..split with a bar and tall bar sit up tables. i was also expecting barren walls. but from what i can tell there wasn't a barren wall in the building.  as far as pierre, i havn't trusted a review of his since i read his review of Sing High (god awful) so his interpretation of a dive bar is completely off. after reading his review i expected to walk into an updated classy newsroom..but was surprised to find a complete opposite. just a nice bar with a really friendly staff.  the seating at the bar is attractive green tweed swivel stools. (tweed..what is more irish then that?) adjacent to the bar is a comfortable seating area with leather arm chairs and high back booths. the prices are far below what i expected. 8 bucks for a sandwich and fries. completely acceptable. this is certainly going to be my go to bar. i expect many years of being trashed and being sweeped out the front door at 2am.   turf thank you for opening, and thank you for the quaint patio for the smokers of the downtown area. much appreciated.  after i get my shit together, expect me here weekly, in fact i'll forward my calls to this place like Norm on cheers.    5 star review surely in the future. bless you.  oh and since i know you will read this, it was nice to meet you Melissa.  come on downtown yelpers, this WILL be the bar you are at on a regular.

2 visits and both times a really good dinner. the food is really good. i don't eat fish, it's a personal belief. but i enjoy the hot kitchen here.   the yaki soba is by the my favorite thing. i've ordered it with Steak and with Tofu and both times it was awesome. plus its like a 2 minute walk from my apartment. i'm surprised i don't eat here more. i promise next time to explore the menu more.

even with the GVJOR this park is really nice...right now. but i think considering how active the area is, this will not become a bum-park.   very nice place to just chill and have a picnic.   ohh yea, the artist for the GVJOR is Janet Echelman an artist from Boston, and this artwork cost aprox 2.5 million. but i think we got a nice park out of it either way.

"It's like a jungle sometimes,  It makes me wonder,  How I keep from going under..."  hopefully Gallo Blanco doesn't go under anytime soon..this spot has been the home of many failstraunts, you know..the places that just can't hang. i really hope more for wee lil' Gallo Blanco.  the menu is straight forward, not overly complicated with too many items to choose from. really easy to fall in love with the simplicity. the 2.00 tacos are really good. and if i ate fish, i could try to settle the long lasting debate on if PHX really has Culture or not...fated by Fish Tacos  but alas, that question still lingers. i can say tho..that if culture was fated on Pork or Beef tacos then i could confidently say that PHX has mad culture. cause the tacos here are awesome. 2 bucks for 3 bites of a fully loaded soft corn tortilla. totally money well spent.  the corn on the cob is freaking amazing. i don't typically order corn on the cob in restaurants because i don't want to be picking corn out of my teeth while having dinner conversation...but these...these right here..these right here are totally worth it. get all that corn up in your chompers and enjoy.  4 stars for great food, comfortable atmosphere.  i took a star from the bland horchata and semi remote location.

4 stars for now because it's not palette and because my food was still hot. 2 huge things that make local breeze pretty damn good.   Mimosas are strong so I'm buzzed. I orders a BBQ burger with a side of 2 fried eggs and crafted my own egg burger. Fucking bomb. Should be on the menu.  i will continue to give Local Breeze my patronage, but i will say...the first cold plate of food i get, i'm outta there.

"All we need is because, come and party with us "  just had a belated birthday dinner party with what i consider my family. figured parlor was the spot to try, yes there are other places i want to try. but this jumped my bookmarks. rolled in bout 6:30 parking was scarce. wait was 45 mins. the waiting patio is cute. herb garden, outside fireplace *off* and the most awesome door i have seen on an eating establishment yet. wood. yup i got hard. 45 minutes later seated. party of 4 nice table sans-booth on this roll up. hostess was nice, introduced herself and asked if it was our first time. i blushed..how did she know i was virgin...bitch. why you gotta call a man out like that? oh well. waitress was nice, did a good job,..could be better..yea. but could have been way way way way worse. i aint gonna rip on someone doing their job unless they just miscarried in my food. that i cannot put up with. that thankfully didn't happen here so i got no beef. i did get some pork. yup sapriccio pizza, (sausage and yum moo!zarella) on a 8". also grubbed on the pesto on a eight inch platter, on deck was the pepperoni. all 3 pizzas was spectacular. gooey ooey and crisp, center of the bottom crust was firm and crisp, unlike bianco and metro which can have some cooking codensation. none here. just pure crisp, like a kit kat. ya know. 7 buck pitchers of PBR. the beer selection was really good. but i was bout the ribbon tonight. grabbed some bruchetta.. some coal charred bits of awesome covered in some sweet and savory toppins. pine nuts, red sweet peppers, some great spreaded cheese topping to hold in all on board. made a great start. pizza was bomb. i'm talking manhatten project bomb. i was blown away like a 1940's japanese soldier. flavors are well put together for signature pizzas. plus you can build you own.. gonna be here a lot more. price isn't bad. actually affordable. i really wanted to snatch a menu because they do not have one posted on the website. worth a trip. hell well worth the 45 minutes wait. i saw plenty of daters coming in and then walking away. come on clown. it's only time.   any ways...i think it's a great addition to the cenpho area. viva non-chain revolucion ya heard!

Hmmm Guacamole 6$ burger.   food - tasty burgers, as far as fast food goes, i think they have a tasty, Caloricly suicidal, burger...next to Burger King..i think it is the most flavorful and good (not saying good for you tho). also, i think they got new fries..because they were pretty damn good. location - ummm could be worse. needs a refresher, remodel.  employees - very nice. not bitter fast food workers. brought food to my table and i didn't need to leave a tip.  corner of Washington and 24th street.

i liked the location more then the original. but i liked the people at the original more. it's not like there is anything wrong with the people at the new location. i just was like super regular at the original location..so i didn't feel like a nobody. :-/   ohh wells. :)

i'm a fan. the Hurricanes did a good job of putting a smile on my face, and during happy hour, 4 hurricanes and the shrimp spring roll was only 25$  so happy hour yes. dinner probably not.   i have loved this building since i was a child. so i'm happy it's still around and not returned to the ground, in rubble.

not a review for the opened air market, but for the storefront.  a little expensive, but the quality is good. i purchased two potatoes to make home made hashbrowns and spent 3 bucks. 6 bucks for a pint of sweet republic ice cream, and a milk stout beer. total 12 bucks. 3 items.  at the same time, if i was at AJ's i'm sure it would have come about to the same price..and i never balked at spending there. i look forward to trying a sandwich there. looks good.

ok..got my first sandwich. meatitarian, with sausage, since saturday is sausage day.  here is an outtake from my facebook update. lol  downtown public market makes bomb ass sandwiches. omg. like really..bomb. like...3 iraqi insurgents went into the place and put a IED in my sandwich. plus that royal coffee place is the ish too...toddy coffee..yes please.  i'll take a moment to expand on that view. after i got home and ate the sandwich was i stoked.   bread is soft, meat delish, peppers sweat and roasted, cheese..melty. sandwich bliss. i'm all over this one from now on. saturday...cometh.

the toddy here is exceptional. i asked for a iced americano and the barista suggested i give the iced coffee a try, so i obliged and it was exceptional. just the look for it made me inquire. "how do you make the iced coffee here?" she started to explain, and i was like.. "ahh so it's a toddy".   i'm all over this place now. 2.20 for a 20oz iced coffee..what?? yea..

Great lil spot for a breakfast burrito. Nothing over the top or fancy. Sturdy furniture and some TVs. Oh they have a cool orange juicer thingy.  ::Disclaimer:: i started this review on the iPhone app. :)  now that i'm home to "finish" my review..i just want to point out..this place is kinda like a very chill taquiria but super clean...i think you know what i mean.  get on it..

Really awesome tacos here. I ordered the black mole and the conchinita pibil tacos. One of each and a steak queso. I didn't expect everything to be so big so I really over did myself. The queso I figured was like a quesadilla but it really isn't anything like that. Closest description is a calzone sized gordita. And not the taco bell version. The cheese was gooey and the undercooked parts of the masa were delicious. It was awesome. I broke out the plastic utensils and went to town. Daunting none the less. But I managed to put down half of it before the coma kicked in   The mole taco was delicious. The chicken was sliced and covered in red onion. The sauce was spicy and not sweet at all. And the whole thing melted in my mouth. The corn taco shells are soft and made to order. The conchinita pibil taco was full of flavor and dripped juices all over the basket. Delicious.   The horchata is unbelievable. Full of fruit and pecans as well as cinnimon and nutmeg.  the salsa bar is epic. there was at least 12 different salsas to try. the cilantro was really good. and i normally hate raw cilantro because i burp it. but this was excellent and really brought out the flavor of my food. also the strawberry salsa was hot with a hint of sweet and freshness. and the salsa peanut was very tasty. very. very.  I'm buying a bike just to ride here.  A lowerider bike with two 20's in a trailer. So I can rock all the way there.  for now condesa....you are in my top 10.

My friend and his fiance had a baby here yesterday. so i went out to visit him and the new addition. the map is wrong. it shows it close to Ray rd and Higley. way way wrong. it's off the US  60 and Higley  Banner Gateway Medical Center Higley Road and US 60 1900 N. Higley Road Gilbert, Arizona 85234  i'm too lazy to suggest it updated...probably wrong zip code or something.  anyways...the hospital is beautiful. rooms were nice, with flat screen tvs in the maternity ward. nice flop couch for visitors to sack out. my friend was telling me the 'chef' in the cafeteria makes food to order. thats cool. it was pretty late when i was there...so i didn't really get to see that much. as hospitals go..i give it a thumbs up. i didn't come out sick...thats a good sign.
