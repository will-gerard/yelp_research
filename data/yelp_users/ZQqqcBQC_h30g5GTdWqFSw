I have been coming here for years. Mo the owner is top notch and only brings in the freshest fish and ingredients! Some of these other negative 1 and 2 star reviews are cracking me, up I'm not buying them. Yeah the decor in the sun room patio may not be "Japanese" enough for you but the rolls, service and up most the sashimi (how you should really rate a sushi place) is excellent and I would even go as far as the best in the valley. A++ give it a try and you won't be disappointed!

Amazing amazing amazing. If you want great Italian food this is a must try spot. The pizza is great too! I order the calamari and shrimp salad for lunch in the summer its light and refreshing. The tortellini DeAngelo is a WOW soooo good! Don't hesitate if you want Italian just go you won't be disappointed.

I was skeptical about this place but I gave it a try one night my girlfriend was out of town. I sat at the sushi bar and was very impressed with the atmosphere (casual and relaxed). The sushi chef and waitress were very pleasant. I ordered some sashimi and a salmon Kama, I eat a lot of sushi and this is a great spot to go for good sushi and a relaxed atmosphere. That's how I like it when I decide on a sushi spot, all the glitz and glam places are for the birds just give me some good fresh fish and let me enjoy that! I will eat here again and again.

This is a great health lunch spot! Also there is a mini Greek market inside so if you need any groceries you can kill two birds with one stone. The chicken kabob, Greek salad and the falafel are my go to. The gyros are great as well but a little too heavy for lunch for me.  If you want a great Greek salad with chicken have them put chicken kabob meat on a Greek salad. Amazing!!

I am so disappointed in my dining in experience tonight. I love the Jalape√±os on Pinnacle Peak but this location was such a disappointment. Terrible all around service and food. Nothing like the Pinnacle Peak location.

It's really good but not 5 starts "the best" for a steak restaurant, there are a few other places nearby that have better steaks if that's what you're looking for. The Preston's burger is amazing, that's what I go here for! Also there are these Pig wings on the menu for appetizers and they are great! Cocktails and happy hour menu are good for a higher end steak restaurant so I do like that. Overall great place to eat, good food, good drinks, but if I'm looking to spend $50+ on a steak I'm going across the street
