This place is really nice and is tucked away in a plaza that is not really noticeable , this places mixes Italian with Japanese and Thai, I love their pad Thai, didn't really like their sushi though, they get realllly busy at nights especially Saturdays and during lunch time, their prices are not expensive and it is definitely a go to spot , I love it but that's if I can get a table!

Had the best facial done by Elina, she's amazing and I regret I haven't gone to her sooner!!! Came out of there feeling so refreshed with my face radiating! Never had an aesthetician add a neck and shoulder massage to the service, she definitely goes above and beyond to satisfy her clients! excellent service, can't wait to go back!

Definitely hard to find a decent Chinese take out place in AZ when you're from NY, but I must say this place is pretty good, we ordered a few times and it always tastes good, chicken n broccoli was good, pad Thai was good as well, although a lot of people love their hot n sour soup I must say I have tried it and it is good soup but its definitely not Hot or Sour, they put shrimps and chicken in which is a nice addition but it costs as much as a large meal would, I like to get a small h&s soup as an appetizer but I can't do that here because its only 1 size and costs about $8 which I think is too much for a take out place! Other than that I really can't complain, I've never been inside, but when my husband picked up the food he said it looks very clean and nice so it's definitely not one of those places where u question if that chicken and broccoli actually has chicken inside! ; )

The best sushi I have tasted in AZ, and I have tried my fair of sushi here.... a very big selection of sushi rolls, some favorites are climax roll, guilty pleasure and first love, love the screaming fever albacore salad. I have to say sushi in AZ is pricey everywhere so its standard there. 2 people usually runs about $60-$80 .... but its worth it, its delicious and very fresh!!!!

I like this spot, tastes good compared to other pizzerias I tried in AZ, bread is not rubbery, their regular slices are good, but I really didn't like their vege pizza which mostly had onions and bell peppers, no broccoli no mushrooms, but I would still recommend it!

Love everything about this spot!!! They have that village in the city like feel, that you just don't typically come across in Phoenix. They are opened LATEEEE, another thing you don't come across in Arizona!!  they have free wifi, plenty of seats ( inside and out) and a great menu from fresh squeezed juices to a long list of caffeine filled delicacies!!!! Only problem is finding this hidden gem !

Im surprised this place doesn't have a 5 star average rating. Food is by far the best chinese food in arizona, very cozy feel inside, the prices are unbelievabely reasonable for the type of food and service they provide. Owner is Leon that came up to our table a few times to check up on us and offer us a few shots of his tequila collection. He is very friendly and warm personality. We lovvvvve this place, everything is delicous!!!!!

The worst food ever, not your typical scottsdale high end place, besides the ambience everything else is horrible. Food was awful, group of 16 and none of us were please, everything was either cold or tasteless, I almost believe it was from the awl-mart frozen section! live music was nice, i would only go there for drinks! Should have been obvious when there was just another couple besides our group on a "busy" saturday night! Will NOT recommend this place to anyone!

The closest resemblance to ny pizza, service is not that great and usually some kids work there who really don't care about customer service or even smiling when talking to customers but that wouldn't stop me from going there for a good slice, their Tuscan chicken pizza is also one of the best, however this place is not cheap , 1 slice is over $3, which I think is overpriced but maybe that's what they go for these days, when I lived in ny, which is about 5 years ago , a slice was less than $2, so I don't know, but I don't eat it that often, usually get it for my son when we visit dessert ridge. p.s: they have snapple

If there was a choice to put 10 stars, id so rate it a perfect 10!!!! Loved the food, everything was as fresh as it gets, service was awesome, by far the best place we've dined at in arizona, the setting is lovely!!! Everything was perfect, eventhough its pricey, but definitely worth every penny!!!!

The 1star is for the carpaccio, other than that experience was horrible. 4 of us get there at 7:10, 8:30 comes and I'm still waiting for a simple hand roll . I tell them to just cancel the rest of the order because we had a show to catch at 8:10 that we were late for, they say they made the handroll but they can cancel the other 2 rolls that they haven't even started with. I am irritated because 1. There aren't that many people there, why is it taking that long to make an albacore handroll 2. Quality Customer service doesn't exist anymore, they could have done something to compensate for their horrible service but didn't seem to care much! Will NOT go back, and their sushi isn't even all that, plenty of amazing sushi places here where service is impeccable , they should take notes.

Been here twice, once for dinner and once for Sunday brunch , both times I loved it, had the salmon over egg baked in the oven, forgot the exact name and it was delicious, their fresh squeezed oj is actually freshly squeezed!!!! Dinner was really good, we went with friends and ordered almost all the different entrees on the menu, everything was very tasty and definitely unique and healthy, love this place, looks very nice too, highly recommend it, oh and their fresh baked bread is to die for !!

These guys are awesome, they definitely know what their doing, great service, been going there for 8 years and I am so lucky I found such an honest company who doesn't beat around the bush or throw in extras that "need to be fixed" like the other place i tried. very straight to the point, job gets done everytime!

Very cold environment.. looks like a takeout chinese place rather than a sushi restaurant... albacore was not fresh, portions are decent, overall quality is poor and I have have much better sushi for that $ here

Ok so although Im tempted to give this place a 1 star, I will be fair and give them 2 because their sushi is always fresh, that is if you have a few hours to wait for it to arrive, with that being said, that is my biggest complaint. I moved to phoenix 5 years ago, this was the 1st place my husband took me to, and I loved it, the sushi was amazing (although their menu is very limited and boring) and their mussels are the best in the valley, they dont stuff it with crab meat, like the other places we went to. However within the past few years, their service has declined tremendously, their host  looks like a kid who does not know much about greeting customers, most of the time looks confused, I havent seen more than 2 servers working on their busiest nights, which ofcourse is a very big problem. We used to like this place also because its pretty close and we thought it would be a convenient location for a quick stop, well that is absolutely not the case, we went there a few days ago, which is definitely our last time, my husband and I had to wait 45 minutes just to get edemame (soybeans), then 30 min later we received our appetizer, now maybe some people dont mind, but I have 2 kids at home and I dont have all the time in the world on a weekday to sit at a sushi spot for 3 hours just to eat dinner. I was so irritated, the server kept apologizing, and ofcourse i know its not his fault, he was waiting for the chefs to prepare our sushi, but they looked like they were in no rush, taking their time chatting away with people sitting in the bar area. The waiter then told me that if we sat at the bar, we would be served sooner, which is complete bullshit, I go to dinner with my husband to enjoy dinner and talk with my husband and not sit at the bar watching them make my sushi, i like my privacy once in a while considering I have 2 little kids at home!!! So 2 hours into dinner we asked for the check before they could finish our 2 last rolls, my husband paid and we left, what a horrible experience, I dont think i was ever that irritated in a restaurant.

This place deserves 10 stars, by far my favorite restaurant ever, absolutely love it. Every time we go to visit, this is definitely where we go for dinner, it's not cheap but well worth every penny, everything is always so fresh and delicious, and I mean everything, we always try new things along with some of our favorites and we just love this place more and more each time. The service is impeccable, the servers are very professional and very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks, if you are not sure what to get , just let them how much you are willing to spend and they will create a tasting menu for you, believe you will not be disappointed!!!! Their sea bass skewers and Peruvian corn is a must have! I mean everything is amazing there, hope everyone gets a chance to try this place!

The only thing that was less than perfect in the sushi is their choice of chopsticks which are little bit on the cheaper side,  other than that the service is outstanding the food is amazing, flawless. Their sushi is one of the freshest to sushi's I have tried in Arizona and you can say we have been around the block when it comes to sushi. We went as a group of eight and we were all very impressed with their drinks were great I personally love the lychee martini my husband Loved the mai tai. Very nice ambience and live there the core especially the red sofa!

Love their bread, always baked fresh , has quit a variety, family owned business, very nice people, all of their breads are very good, I usually also get the spinach and cheese pastry there that they sell as well, it's amazing! Tip: they are closed on Mondays and if you go later in the afternoon it's always good to call ahead and make sure they still have specific bread available because they sell out quick

Horrible service, came in on a Sunday with my husband and two kids. Ordered one she's fine and waited for 30 minutes, my kids are so impatient we came up to az and they didn't even put the pizza in the oven while there was only three other people sitting in the pizzeria. Clearly they're not ready to cater to the public. We were so irritated at that point that we did not want to stay there, we asked for a refund and left. Apparently were not the first family of the day to ask for refund Because of their poor service. Definitely never going back there again

This place is simply the best decision you can make as a parent. I was a stay at home mom until I needed to go to school, then I decided to give my child to a daycare, I tried to places before I found this one. Let's just say this is the first place where my child was looking forward to go to!!! It's a very peaceful safe environment,  they have home-cooked meals every day, hot breakfasts and my kids are always clean and happy, what else can a parent possibly expect from a daycare! Both of my kids while I'm there,  I highly recommend people to go check it out!!!!

The 1 star goes to the waiters that were very sweet and the view was breathtaking, other than that everything was horrible, my husband & I along with another couple decided to go there for Valentines Dinner, what a huge mistake that was, there was a fixed 5 course meal with absolutely no options or substitutes, usually fixed menus at least gives an option to choose between 2 or 3, but not this place. There was alot of dairy and pork on the menu, where my husband could not eat, so they tried to bring something else, but it was awful, we asked for bread, it was soft but they were simple dinner rolls, nothing special, in other words we just kept ordering more bread because the food was just plain nasty, i mean come on, one of the courses was a pear with mascarpone cheese inside, maybe there are a few people who may like that, but I know that majority would never order that, how can they add that to a fixed menu, its beyond me!!!! The main course was a steak, which was burnt but raw inside, i mean it was so chewy where my jaw started to hurt me, at that point I couldn't stay quiet anymore so I complained to the server and he seemed to sympathize with me, and gave me a look like I was not the 1st one to complain that night, another server said that their menu is so much better on a regular night, but that didnt matter to us because we were already there, they did try to compensate and brought out a few extra pieces of lobster but the worst part was ofcourse the bill, we paid wayyyyyy too much and I felt horrible because I made the reservations. Safe to say I will NOT be returning to that place, and I was veryyyy disappointed, probably would have had a better meal at McDonalds or something.

Moving from NY 2 years ago was a big change, didn't realize how big untill I tried the pizza and chinese here. This is the first place that actually knows what duck sauce is.... must be honest what got my attention at first was the name of the place.... food is really good for a take out chinese food... delivery is quick... prices are decent... overall good place to try!!!

We are frequent visitors of Vegas and like to try new places, well what a disappointment this was, the place when you walk in looks very nice, ambience is great, definitely looks like a high end place, until you see that all servers are wearing plaid shirts, jeans, shorts, etc... Basically they have no dress code which was a total shocker. We sat down, looked at the menu, ordered a few different things , 1 was the tartar, which came with a raw quail egg and it was blahhhhh... I had to return it, mind u there was a new person coming up each time, so we didn't know who exactly we were looking for when we needed something, the sushi definitely was not impressive and we left disappointed and hungry, and paid over $200, for a price like that I expect much more. Definitely will not return there again!

I love love love this place, it's definitely worth the 1/2 hour road trip for me, their crepes are to die for and best of all are their coffee drinks, the ambience is great, staff is super friendly, marina is the sweetest person ever, very humble and down to earth, had no idea she was the owner.... Have not had any crepes that come close to these, texture and flavor is just perfect, we love the Nutella strawberry banana crepe, but we always try something else on the menu!

The worst and most unrelaxing spa experience ever. My husband and I travel to las vegas pretty often for a quick getaway, and we love spas, since we stayed at Treaure Island we decided to try out the spa there. Boy were we in for a surprise, the front desk with the big hair and fake eye lashes was sooooo mean and rude, we felt like she was doing us a favor by setting us up. I felt very uncomfortable, she had an atitude when I asked her about one of the services, and at the end they ended up over charging us for a service that they provided a courtesy because they didnt have someone to perform one of the other services that my husband had initially requested. I was shocked and appalled at her atitude and bhavior, I swore I'd never go there again, however the masseuses were really nice and proffessional. For the money we spent there over $400 I expected better service and a warmer greeting.

Loved the place, ambience was amazing, very intimate. We went there for a small bday celebration, the place was fully booked so we sat by the bar, which had tables and everything, so we still had privacy! I really liked their drink menu, service is awesome the only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because of their very limited menu, the appetizers were mouth watering, we ordered the albacore, yellowtail, ahi and the grilled bread (must have for bread lovers ), but when we were looking at the main courses every meat dish was made with pork, the only other option was the market fish! I didn't mind , I always get fish but my husband is a meat lover and we don't eat pork, so he had to get the fish! For dessert their chocolate mousse was amazing!

Dr. Ackerman is the nicest little man with so much knowledge and experience, I am so glad to have found a great eye doctor in phoenix. He is located in the same plaza as my kids pediatrician, so i thought it wouldnt hurt to stop by, boy was I glad i did. The staff were so kind and courteous, one of them i think her name is spelled Ina (black curly hair) was kind enough to call my insurance company and stay on the phone with them for over 45 min to see if it covered one of the procedures I needed. The glasses are a bit pricey but im sure its standard pricing, other than that I have no complaints!!!!

Love this place, my husband and son get their cuts by Lenny, he's the nicest guy ever and great with kids. Atmosphere is great, his cuts are awesome and he's the only one that can have my son sitting still for 15 min ; ). They have ipads and games, drinks, not something we are used to seeing at regular barbershops.

Let me start off by saying that I have been craving some real authentic Shawarma for the longest time in AZ, and finally my friend told me that this place has it so I knew I had to try it, I will not mind the food is pretty amazing and definitely has the authentic flavor but they really need to brush up on their customer service skills... Based on the reviews I read I noticed that this is a pattern with this place, not very friendly and don't really care for you when you come in! Their chicken shawarma is delicious, the hummus is tasteless and over priced, and the frozen French fries should be substituted with real potato fries! But despite the poor service, we will most likely be back, food is good!

The best sushi spot in AZ, this hidden hole in the wall gem is absolutely delicious, with the freshest fish and best customer service....

Must try for those that like original spots

Found out about Dino's from a neighborhood post, went with my family for dinner, was not disappointed, food was delicious, had a Caesar salad and a 16 inch pizza , the crust was amazinggggg, so crispy , not something I come across too often living in AZ.. The staff is super friendly, the only thing I will mention is that they are clearly still putting the finishing touches together on the look and presentation, and are not quite all set up, but they are only open for 3 weeks and they haven't had their official grand opening, but I will definitely be back and recommend it to everyone! I mean at the end of the day its the food and service that matters to me and they are a 10 in both!!!

Love Pho, so definitely had to stop by the new neighborhood Vietnamese place! The soup is delicious, doesn't have that weird after taste and smell that other Places have, so can't complain, hope they stick around!  Prices are ok, wouldn't say they are cheap. Their menu is very limited which I don't really care about since the only thing I come here for is Pho anyway, will definitely recommend!
