*drool* I don't typically eat Italian but I was invited to go here. The owner is incredibly cordial and hospitable and the food was incredibly delicious. Best salmon and veggies ever!

I felt like I should have been in France. It is beautifully decorated. I came here for brunch and had a french press coffee with (whatever they call it in France)... basically a fancy scrambled eggs with salmon and toasted baguettes. It was amazing! I also tried the pesto chicken and it did not disappoint. I will be here again...

LOVE this place. The customer service is superb, the atmosphere is practically spottless and they offer a complimentary adult beverage. Only downside, a bit pricey. But worth it. Literally the best pedicure I ever had! I highly recommend!

Holy smokes heed the warnings. I will never order from here again. Not only is the pizza unimpressive but 2 hours after ordering, it was delivered... Cold. Not the first time experiencing this either.

Ugh my gawd. I'm so upset I don't live on this side of town anymore! My dentist (I won't go to anyone else) is over here. And who doesn't mix coffee and going to the dentist together?! Apparently I'm one of very few. I'd always wanted to try this place out  and now was my opportunity! I got one of their fancy lattes- and now no other coffee will compare (Sorry Dutch Bros.). Their assortment of goodies, all I could do was drool because I'm only allowed to eat veggies and fruit at the moment. I did get a cookie for my son who gobbled it up- but he's a cookie monster. REGARDLESS, I could tell it was a chewy (I hate the word moist and refuse to say moist- your welcome all you "moist" word haters) and delectable M&M cookie. I wish it was bulking season *sigh*...

I loved this place. New to the area and decided to try it out. As a female, I was a bit nervous about going to a barber HOWEVER, I just have to try out the new trend of girl cuts with designs. My guy was awesome enough to master it. Also had my son's hair done. He's 4 and fidgety but he was still able to master it!

I came here on a Sunday morning while being a hot mess from Saturday nights festivities in hopes for a cure. A cure from a tequila overdose. Oh geeze... bagels galore! So fresh... so soft and chewy. So many choices. It reminds me I am a fat kid at heart. Wish it was closer to me... then I'd really be a fat kid. I swear it cured my hangover.

It's pretty good. I would go if a majority rule decides to go here, otherwise I have other places in mind. They do have an amazing ramen however.

Gawd I love this place. I always have such good service and enjoy the seasonal menus they put out. The atmosphere is beautiful and comfortable. I take health conscious doctors (since some don't care about their health) and speakers out to this place and it's always been well received. I don't do grains so when I requested their teriyaki bowl to be made with spaghetti squash, they were happy to accommodate. As much as I wanted dessert, I had to pass... but next time, it's on!

I use this place for deliveey. For a place that delivers, I gave it 4 stars. Very tasty considering how reasonably priced it is. It amazes me the low stars some people leave- if they want incredible,  they're going to have to pay a bit more. Thanks to this place, I don't have to resort to eating taco bell on the nights I'm too tired to cook.

This place made me happy. As my first time there, they comp-ed one of my rolls. The server was amazing too, very attentive and sweet. I ordered a few rolls, some sake and a "side order" of chicken chow mein for my kiddo. The side dish was enough to feed 2 kids and the rolls were very tasty. They get an A+ for presentation. One of the rolls that came out was beautifully lined on a bowl and the center was lit on fire right before our eyes. To top it off, they are so incredibly reasonable. Would be a shame NOT to come here with all these goodies. I will definitely be coming back.

I am SO disappointed!!! Whats with the good reviews? I came here once before and was ok with it. The second time convinced me not to come back. Very unevenly done gel and polish job is subpar. Then... They charged $55... For a gel fill! That's high even for a full set. Needless to say, I will nit ve back. At least the high dollar places I've gone, offer a complimentary beverage and they do a good job.

I just came for drinks but it was an overall good experience. The bartenders are super attentive and friendly. They made a great Cosmo. I will tell yall that it's an older crowd that comes here. I'd come back again though.

It is so hard to write this review because the food is SO good... but the service is TERRIBLE. While the staff is polite, they can probably learn how to be a tad more attentive. Waited around 10 minutes at the bar before someone finally stepped up to get our order. Then waited a while before getting our drinks. Then our food was served without silverware... and waited for someone to return to get silverware. It's so unfortunate.

When I come here,  I feel like I'm in my living room! I love it! This place gets crazy busy most weekends.  There's comfy couches and lounge chairs.  Has a nice patio that you can enjoy while drinking wine.  I've had the food here too.  Fairly typical of a wine bar... bruchetta, pizzas, salads, sandwiches... but it's all good stuff. If you're into djs, they have that on Saturday.  This is my wine bar of choice.

I have ordered from this place several times with co-workers for delivery. I'm sure the food is usually great but by the time the food gets to us, it's cold. If they run out of an item you ordered, they don't call you back but replace it with something else without asking. They have also forgotten to deliver items as well. It seemed so promising but after our 3rd time ordering and being unhappy, we won't be ordering again. Which is a shame because they could have gotten a lot of business from our large medical group.

I enjoy this place. I LOVE the atmosphere. Lovely trees and outdoor seating. They have massive umbrellas to assure the sun doesn't hit your eyes. I liken it to OHSO but smaller, a little dressier, and more romantic. I came on a Sunday where I had unlimited mimosas. Our server was fabulous too. Very attentive. They had a good menu as well. Huge fan of brunch- theirs ranges from traditional bacon and eggs, to captain crunch waffles. I'll come back for sure. I'm confident we can make this place popular!

Here's the deal. When I go to a wine bar- it's for a good time without being crazy. Let's separate this place out. The bar= a good time. They have some great bartenders (what do you call ones who serve only wine???)... They're friendly, hospitable, and ready to go.  The actual seating- and the server I've had twice in the past... not so fun. It felt like a burden taking our order. Don't people know what makes a good tip??? Get us jolly on some wine and most people become very giving. Don't kill that vibe!  Let's chat about the self serve wine... not a fan. I don't like standing awkwardly at spigots of wine as if it's a soda fountain. Unique idea but it's not winning me over. I'm happy that it's an option.   So here you have it- I will sit nicely at the bar, with the ever so friendly bartenders serving my wine for me. Have I mentioned they have a good happy hour special? Chea!!!!

One of my favorite, low key wine bars. I come back fairly often and witness how involved the owners are. I LOVE the wine flights they offer and they have some tasty little appetizers to boot. To top it off, it is a great place for a party of 12 or so. They have games you can play (ahem... cards against humanity. Who doesn't love that???) and they have live music.

Ughhhh... ick! Check PUH-LEASE! This place is empty, which merits suspish in the first place.  The atmosphere just feels dirty and dusty.  It's dark and dingy and that does not do well for bacteria. The staff wasn't too helpful either. The food. Disappointing. It just wasn't good and I can't put my finger on why. Far from fresh it felt. So yeah. It's all i can say about this place.

Love this place. I've tried other places and always come back here. If you are a stickler for clean and sanitary, you won't find better. They have all sorts of colors and do designs too. Pretty much everyone rocks here too. But I typically see Jack or Hannah. They few people who left bad reviews must have had a bad day. I've been coming here for over a year, every couple of weeks.
