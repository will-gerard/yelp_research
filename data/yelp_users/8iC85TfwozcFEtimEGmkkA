This place is awesome with great food and reasonable pricing. Edgar, the owner is a really nice guy and makes sure you like what you eat. I have been a regular since a year now, and I always have the gyro plate with spicy hummus, and it's great. But recently, I tried the lamb kabobs, and trust me, they are to die for. The meat is so juicy, well marinated and well grilled, you will close your eyes every time to dig into a kabob. Though the lamb kabob is a little pricey ( yes, lamb is pricey in America), it is totally worth the bucks!   Go try this place if you haven't already, and you won't be disappointed.

2 words -RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE!!   I just had to get a light bulb replaced and they quoted 60$ just for labor, as they thought it might take an hour to fix it. Apparently he was cribbing about the fact that he had to remove the carpet in the trunk to get to the light -what else was he expecting, to get to light with a mere stretch of an hand. Wouldn't I do it myself if it was that easy and didn't need any tools! I got it replaced at pep boys for a mere 10$. The guy there did it in under 10 mins.   Not even sure why people would even go there. If you have that kind of 'super' excess money, might as well go to the dealer!

The Barber shop with the classic feel. Old school, clean place and friendly staff. I went there for the first time and Stan did my haircut. He understood exactly what I wanted and did much better than expected- a 5 star haircut!
