Best Buy offers insurance on their items... we have used that insurance twice and can proclaim that it was PAINLESS! We first used the warranty on our PS3 that died 2 months before our warranty was up. No Hassles, No trying to haggle out of their end of the contract.   Our daughter got a Droid X 2 months ago and when she was playing basketball outside the DroidX fell on the ground and shattered... it was still functional, but the glass was destroyed. Best Buy did not even blink... just said 'Oh, we see a lot of this.' 3 days later we had an entirely new phone!   I have been impressed!

Top Notch Cardiovascular Care Here! A wonderful aspect of BBHH is the comfortable and spacious visitor waiting areas with coffee, TV and helpful volunteers. The gift shop on the main level is well stocked and if you are lucky, one of the volunteers will be playing the baby grand piano in the lobby! The cafe here is not that great, but for a short walk, you can enjoy the amazing cafeteria at BBMC which is adjacent to BBHH. Also, Dairy Queen and Starbuck's are across the street.

For visitors and employees alike, the gift shop and cafeteria are hands down the best offered in any medical facility in the valley. I have had the opportunity to work or visit many valley hospitals and can attest that Banner Baywood's gift shop and cafeteria are superior.      The Gift shop is a great place to get unique jewelry that is NOT clunky-junky. They have really cute selections that vary from week to week; I have even purchased shoes in the gift shop!      The cafeteria is very well organized and offers amazing selections of fresh fruits/veggies and home made soups. Each day you have a selection of grill items, specialty items, and the stand-by home made chili that is so good you may just become addicted to it. (Consider yourself warned!)      The cafeteria has ample seating and is well maintained. There is also an atrium where you can dine in an 'outdoor' type setting. Enjoy the jukebox while you dine... and maybe pop over to the Java Cafe for some Starbuck's Coffee or teas along with decadent pastries.

From my first call, to the lasting impression of seeing my beautiful carpets Brimley's met our high standards. The phone receptionist was kind and very accommodating. When I met Rob at the door, he had his towel down on the ground to ensure that there would be no tracking extra dirt/leaves into our home.   Rob is a consummate professional, he listened to my list of 'needs' and did not laugh at my obvious OCD. Even though I am very particular and tend to hold the bar exceedingly high for those I am paying to provide a service; I could not find ONE thing I wish had been done differently!  I also RARELY refer a company to friends because I do not want to be disappointed. I will not hesitate to give a glowing recommendation to any who need carpet/tile/upholstery cleaning done.   Trust this business, you will NOT be disappointed.

On Sunday, I took my 16 year old daughter for her first lip piercing. I also wanted to repierce my upper/outer ear cartilege as my old piercing had closed up.   As an RN, I am very cautious about aseptic technique and was immediately impressed by the cleanliness of the entire shop. HTC in Tempe is well lit and CLEAN.   Kat was our piercing artist and she was incredibly knowlegeable and proficient. Even though my daughter and I both have high pain tolerances, we were expecting a moderate amount of pain. In the past our piercings were with the 'gun' and those were painful.   Kat was talking my daughter through her procedure as I snapped photos (hey, I am a momma!) I was watching my daughter's face for any evidence that this was too much for her. She did not even grimace or furrow her brow. I was duly impressed!   Kat thoroughly cleaned the table/tray area before starting my piercing. As Kat was preparing my ear, my daughter commented that she was light headed and nauseated. Kat calmly told her that this sometimes happens and had her lay down. They gave her some apple juice and a nice ice pack for her neck. In a very short amount of time she was all better.   Now, it was my turn... I laid down on the table and Kat prepared me for the piercing. She told me to take a deep breath and blow it out... but, I seriously did NOT feel a thing!! I was incredulous... how on earth could a cartilege piercing not hurt at all?   I have already planned out my next 4 piercings and Kat will be my girl!! It has been 2 days now and our piercings are doing very well and very minimal swelling to my daughter's lip. Phenemonal after care teaching ensures that your piercings will be able to heal without infection or pain.   I will be in again and again for Kat;s piercings!

The Commons makes amazing coffees, teas, and fruit smoothies that are not full of HFCS! The staff is personable and the prices are just right. They also have sandwiches and cookies. Great atmosphere to just hang out between services and fellowship with friends!

Word of mouth brought me to Skinovative. The professional staff and thorough interview to identify my needs convinced me that this was the place for me. I have been to other 'day spas', and a certain skin care franchise that left me dissatisfied. From the welcoming reception area, to the friendly staff and professional care... Skinovative impresses!  Other businesses will rush you out the door to herd the next client in... not here, you are given time to ensure your questions are answered, your after care instructions are verbalized and you are given time to ensure you understand... instead of a hastily grabbed sheet of paper shoved at you as you are herded out.   No more franchise skin care for me! Dr. Fulton's Skinovative office is my choice from now on!  You will not be disappointed.!

The only thing preventing this Famous Dave's from getting 5 stars is the acoustics. Like all Famous Dave's that we have gone to, the music is very loud... but, for some reason this particular site seems to have an extra 'tinny' din that makes casual conversation nearly impossible. I felt sorry for 'Famous Anthony' because I could tell he was struggling to understand our orders. If you have a chance to sit in Anthony's section, you will be delighted! He was attentive, humorous without being annoying, and made our large family gathering feel like it was 'no problem'. Inlaws, 5 children and my husband and I... 9 folks to keep satisfied, and he performed amazingly!

I tried the french vanilla cappuccino. I was amazed that it is better than starbucks! I paid a dollar 50 for what would cost me 3 dollars at starbucks. I found a new morning coffee joint.

A church that preaches an unadulterated Gospel... meaning that the message that was good enough for the disciples of Christ are good enough for Redemption Church!   The worship music varies from a more subdued Adult Contemporary in the chapel at 8am, to a more upbeat Adult Contemporary in the chapel and conference center (video feed for the teaching) at 10am, the 4pm and 6pm.  The Commons bookstore and coffee shop are an excellent place for fellowship.

Darren is a first rate professional. He not only showed up on time but called later to see that everything was to our satisfaction. We purchased a short sale home and the lawn was so horrible we considered getting sod  Darren assured us he could get our lawn looking great by May... it is now mid-April and he was right. We no longer have a weed and brown patch ridden lawn. Also, when we had an irrigation issue, he referred me to a wonderful company. I even got a fantastic house cleaning company when he heard me comment on how our other company flaked out on us. Once again his recommendation was bang on. We will be loyal customers from now on. As for the reviews of no call/ no show... I think they have the wrong company.

I suffer from severe PTSD from a horrendous root canal at age 12. I have panic attacks for routine cleanings and spending time in the dentist's chair for 'work' causes me sleepless nights before hand and even canceled appointments out of fear.   When I explained my issue to Dr. Ramsey, he was very understanding and took time to ensure that I was 'comfortably numb' from the anesthetic before doing anything. He even paused frequently when he could tell that I was getting a 'panic attack'... I was able to deep breathe and calm myself down.   I had absolutely NO pain in the 3 hours I spent in the chair today.   Do yourself a favor, make the drive to his office. We live over 20 miles away and I will always go here.

New ownership has really made this dealership shine. Ask for Big O if you are interested in a new vehicle without the song and dance of other dealerships. He put NO pressure on us to make a decision.  For Service I trust Chris P. You can count on integrity and competence with him.

Unfortunately, the sparkle of new ownership faded far too rapidly. When returning to purchase a used vehicle for our daughter, I was pre-approved for a loan through our credit union at 3%. (We have credit scores over 750.) Pulling into the parking lot, it was evident that this was a vastly different place than we came to less than 3 years ago. The parking lot is DANGEROUS to maneuver in, we were nearly T-boned by an employee trying to park a car in the jammed up lot. I noticed customer vehicles parked along the side of the parking lot where they could easily be hit by customers or employees attempting to maneuver through the lot. I noticed they added on to the shop area, but it seems they underestimated how that addition would impact parking for the cars they are fixing.        Once we managed to navigate to the sales floor, I explained that we had a pre-approved loan for $15,000. Our daughter drove a used Dart and thought it would serve her purposes well. When the time for number crunching came, I was repeatedly asked 'What price do you want per month?'. I explained several times that we were pre-approved. The salesman brought us paperwork that showed a 9% interest rate. When I once again stated we were pre-approved for a loan with a MUCH lower rate, they THEN said 'We will match their interest rate.'. Umm, no thank you. We headed to Scottsdale and bought her a used Lexus which she LOVES.        It is sad to see a business go so far from their progress when Big Al bought acquired the dealership 3 years ago. Maybe the 'new puppy syndrome' happened with the dealership. The first few months it is adored and doted on, then after a year or so, it is simply another chore for them.

Disorganization with office staff and inability to respond to emails started my red flags waving. When I called the office and Scott seemed to not want to talk to me and implied we never emailed, I asked him if I should forward my prior email. He then told me he would have Julie call me back. Julie did call me and I was not impressed with her communication style at all. I am a professional and understand that we all have bad days, but she could not find our email, then said 'Oh, that one...' Then, when I mentioned needing the lawn winterized she said 'What do you mean, winterized?'... Umm, nevermind... NEXT company on my list will get a call.
