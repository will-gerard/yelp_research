Always great friendly service when dining in or taking out. They specialize in thin crust pizzas and The Get Meaty is my favorite. The menu is extensive and you can do half and half specialty pies to keep things interesting. I really enjoy the family owned vibe. Highly recommend and I would eat here again!

I went to Carnegie for breakfast and I ordered the Pastrami and Egg sandwich on rye for $11 and to my surprise it was all egg with tiny bits of pastrami. I also sampled the hamburger which was okay and the mushroom omelet which was good, but not great.  Carnegie Delicatessen & Restaurant is decent, and the pictures on Yelp make it look worth trying, but be warned that the huge sandwiches you see start at $20+ and I don't believe it's worth it for the money. 3 people ate for $50 pre-tip. Service is friendly, but slow. I would not eat here again.    Tip: Open 24 Hours day. Breakfast items come with toast and French fries, but the sandwiches don't come with any sides so you have order it a la carte. I tried the potato salad which was fairly good.

The food here is decent at best. Most recently I tried the Filet Mignon with eggs and spinach Breakfast Sliders and although nice looking, it didn't taste very good for a $20 item. I sampled the Build your Own Omelet (ham, tomatoes, and mushrooms) and New York Steak and Eggs and both were just okay.  Service was also only okay. We were seated right away, but our server never refilled my juice. Studio Cafe has a variety of food choices, gives you the entire pot of coffee in a thermos and is opened 24 hours a day. However, given the many other choices at the MGM Grand, I would not eat here again.

Definitely wait to come here after 11:30 a.m. If you arrive early like I did at 10:45 a.m. everything they're serving isn't fresh. The first 3-4 dishes we ate were cold and disappointing. But once they start pushing around the fresh dim sum carts, the food is pretty decent. Just keep your expectations low and do not order the Wonton Noodle Soup (it's not worth the $7). I wouldn't eat here again if I could help it, supposedly there are better dim sum places in Vegas.

If you're staying at the MGM Grand, I recommend trying Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill. I ate there for lunch and dinner and shared a total of 6 dishes. I suggest the Corned Beef Reuben with Sauerkraut and Swiss on Rye with Potato Salad for $15 if you want a good deli style sandwich. The Fish of the Day (Halibut) with Wild Mushrooms and Pearl Onions, Creamy Corn Puree and Tomato Fondue for $31 was also very good. For salads, I thought the Chopped Vegetable Salad with Feta Cheese, Garlic Croutons and Creamy Greek Dressing was very good and can easily be shared with people as an appetizer.  The portions vary between the dishes. I thought the Ricotta Gnocchi with Sweet Fennel-Sausage Bolognese for $23 was a little on the small side compared to the Sweet Pea and Goat Cheese Filled Tortellini with Wild Mushrooms and Parmesan Reggiano for $25. You also can't go wrong with the Grilled Prime Burger with Vermont Cheddar and Smoked Onion Marmalade for $18.   The Crab cakes were delicious, $17 for 4 crab cakes. When comparing Wolfgang Puck's prices to other MGM restaurants, this place is very reasonable and the servers provided excellent service both times I dined. Nice atmosphere too. I would go eat here again.

Pho Avina excels in beef pho with its very sweet and not too oily broth. Their chicken pho has more of a Chinese wonton soup broth, but it's still very good if you're feeling a cold coming on. They also do a great job with rice dishes, my favorite is #58. The rest of other dishes they offer like spring rolls and Vietnamese sandwiches are good, but nothing to rave about. Although, they do offer very good boba drinks. It's arguably better than Viet Kitchen and Pho Thanh. I go here all the time for the past two years and highly recommend.

Delicious ramen and udon with high customizable options for whatever you're feeling. Spacious and hip/casual atmosphere with $5 large kirin bottles during happy hour. Perfect for meat lovers and vegetarians alike. I would eat here again.

Tasty salty beef broth with good portion and price. Unique ambience, might be the first pho bar restaurants with live music I've been to in my life. If you love pho, give this place a shot. I would eat here again.

I've been here a handful of times, and it's become my safety sushi spot. It's always filled with people, but I've never waited to be seated. Everything tastes good, most items are $2 a plate, and there's a lot of interesting rolls. In short, it's good sushi at reasonable prices with fast service. Compared to Teharu Sushi (another revolving sushi joint), this place has more variety...albeit you'll feel it ever so slightly in your wallet. Expect to pay about $20 after tip with no alcohol, but you'll be full and satisfied. I would eat here again.

Hands down eggplant Parmesan and Nana's pizza are  the best two options in my opinion. At 2 slices with a soda for $6.50, it's hard to find a better bang for your buck. I'm talking authentic New York style pizza with fast and friendly service. They change their pizza by the slice daily, but you're bound to find something that suits you. Isa's Pizza has made it into my regular lunch rotations and I highly recommend.

A friend and I were the only ones in the restaurant at 11:20 AM on a Saturday -- I guess sushi isn't a brunch thing. The low prices of sushi plates drew me in, and two tall Asahi beers later, it started getting busy around noon. I tried almost everything that was on the conveyer belt, and my favorites here were the Hawaiian roll and Crunchy roll (they put delicious little fried onions on top). The nigiri salmon is priced at $1 a plate, which is a steal. The yellow tail, albacore nigiri, and gyoza also tasted good. Teharu is definitely a value priced sushi joint that has a lot to offer if you're a fan of nibbling on a variety sushi while dining. But die-hard sushi connoisseurs will probably not be impressed. I would eat here again.
