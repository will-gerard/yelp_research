They did a great job. I went in for the first time and got the ultra wash. They were fast and efficient without skipping steps and being sloppy. I'll be back for another one soon. I have to keep my beauty clean. :)

Everything was pretty tasty! But I loved our waiter Allan! He was very nice, polite, and attentive. He made the experience wonderful.

How can I not give Great Wall 5 stars for its DimSum?! Yummy!! We came in on a Saturday morning and were seated quickly. The carts came by fast and when we couldn't find what we wanted they brought what we wanted right away. Service was awesome and they were nice. Yeah, it isn't harbour in Seattle but we are in Phoenix! My 5 stars is for the area as well, there isn't a plethora of DimSum to choose from so for Phoenix area this is a 5 star.This place is way closer to our house as opposed to Phoenix palace and i like great walls food  better. This is my new DimSum spot.

It was awesome! I see why it had such high reviews. Our waitress Danny was very attentive, knowledgable, and nice. We ordered the peach ale and my fiancé ordered the kilt lifter, 8th street, and the raj he liked them all. The food was delicious I highly recommend the shrimp bruschetta and the pub fish and chips. We also got the spicy garlic fries. It was all so delicious. We look forward to going  back.

The best thing about this experience was our server Greg. He was a tall Older gentlemen with a surfer type accent. Very cool. Once we were seated no one came up to our table for a little while, I am not a complainer but when I have to bring up the wait time for anything to my husband you know it is not good. Thankfully, Greg noticed us and took us on as one of his tables. My husband ordered the shrimp and steak fajitas which were about 16 dollars and I ordered the shrimp ones which were close to the same price. It was pretty bland and your typical franchise tex-mex place. We usually go to Rio cafe by our house and we will be sticking to it because at least there the taste is authentic the portions are bigger and so are the shrimp. For the price we paid at on the border it was a rip off. We won't be back but if you are in the mood for an overpriced unauthentic Mexican style cuisine then go here and make sure to ask for Greg!

It was so good! My family and I made reservation for 7:15 on a Saturday night. We arrived a few minutes early but we were seated right away. We ordered a couple of the liter beers and an appetizer to start, the stuffed mushrooms which were on point! Especially with the cream sauce( ask for extra) my Fiancé and I ordered the Jagersnitzschel plus added spatzle, potato dumpling, and sauerkraut. Make sure to get extra sauce for everything. Everything was delicious except for the spatzle which could have used a thicker gravy sauce as well as the potato dumpling. I was stationed in Germany awhile back so I think I might know a thing or two... Everything was pretty authentic but I think they need to make the gravy thicker and with a little more flavor. Other than that it was delicious and we will be back to try other things. The Sauer kraut was some of the best we have ever had. Our server was very nice and attentive her name was Angela. The ambiance was great too, we really liked the live music.

Tried kabuki because of yelp reviews and also because we just moved here from California. The first place we tried (fresh wasabi) was awful and had bite sized rolls. My bf and I decided to try kabuki in Peoria and boy were we pleasantly surprised. One of the owners was our sushi chef and he was very friendly and made everything so delicious!! The seared albacore roll is my fav! This is definitely my new sushi spot. No more searching. Our waitress was awesome too. FYI the portion and size of the rolls is excellent. We'll be back soon! :)

A lot better than Panda Express. Ordered the regular size dark meat chicken rice bowl and it was so good. I love the teriyaki suace and made sure to ask for extra! The regular size is a perfect portion to fill you up and they aren't skimpy on food. It's nice to find a clean, fast, and delicious teriyaki joint. We will be back.

My family and I came here for brunch and it was delicious. The wait wasn't too bad for a Saturday at 1130. 3 of us ordered the California eggs Benedict which was amazing!!! Heaven in your mouth. We also got a side of biscuits and gravy which was also homemade and delicious. The staff was very nice and friendly. I liked the variety they had on the kids menu for my daughter. You will not leave here hungry.

I'm going to give this place five stars because it is in surprise. So far the best Mexican food I've tried here which isn't saying much considering I've been to Macayos and that place is awful. Any other place like southern Cali I'd still give it a 4. Ordered the rio Rico burrito( I think that's what it's called) with shrimp for 16.50 and oh my yum was it delicious!! Every bite had big juicy shrimp, mushrooms, peppers, onions, and the sauce was amazing. It came with refried beans and rice which were good as well. The chips and salsa were delicious too. All in all everything was delicious and we will be back again. It's better than a-ok.  Service- great and attentive. Cleanliness- good.  I know good Mexican food and what I had tonight was it.

I don't know if it is because my family and I went early or what but service shouldn't take 20 minutes to get a roll. Not only were we not greeted right away it took forever to get our sushi. The sushi rolls were okay but not worth the wait or the money especially since they were slow. Plus it sounded more like we were in a Mexican restaurant than a Japanese restaurant. I am all for speaking a different language but not so loud you make your customers uncomfortable. All in all we will not be coming back.

I heard from my cousin that the fish here is the freshest around. She was right! It was delicious and Fresh.   My boyfriend and I came on a Wednesday afternoon for the 4-6 happy hour. I was pleasantly surprised at their large happy hour selection of sushi and appetizers. However the rolls I ordered were not on the happy hour menu but the beer was. I order the Baja and the butter me up roll, both without cucumber because I for some reason despise cucumber with a passion of a thousand burning suns. My boyfriend ordered the Rainbow Roll with spicy mayo and the Hollywood roll. presentation was excellent and so was the taste for all 4 rolls. The service was friendly but the sushi took a little while but it was well worth the wait. I will definitely be back here again soon. I know it gets crazy busy on the weekends so I will let you know if the service or quality lacks when and if I come during that time. I took pictures of all four rolls we ordered since there are not a lot on yelp for this place.

Everything was delicious! The service was fast and friendly. We had dinner and decided the teppanyaki show would be fun for the family. The chef was very friendly and fun, he cooked everything great. His name was Gary. Definitely coming back again.

Okay... So I am the duchess of ah so out here in Goodyear az but I am changing my review because for some reason the service has been sucking the past few times I have been in!! We go for the teppanyaki experience and I don't care what they say, if you sit at a table and order the same thing it does NOT taste like the teppanyaki from the grill... Just because it is only my husband and I doesn't mean we aren't worth the show or at least proper portions... They have overcooked our steak the past few times as well which is ridiculous!!! How do you ask for rare and give my husband well done?! Bullshit! If I'm paying 26-30 dollars for my meal it better be freaking right! For some reason after Gary left this place has gone to crap! We haven't been in a few weeks because of our last awful experience but decided to give them one more chance... Walked in was seated at the teppanyaki grill side... Then we waited, waited, and waited... After 7 minutes I got up and asked if they were going to take our drink order... We were then greeted by the bar tender apologizing to us because there were only two chefs that night and the other two tables were full and just ordered... We were seated because it was the new girls first day... And the wait would be 20-25 minutes... F that!!! We left and are now at Texas Roadhouse... Someone will be taking my crown because we will never go back to this ah so again. **we tip really well too**

They have really good fish tacos. They don't skimp u on the fish like some places do. I can't complain about decent fast Mexican food. I'll be back again.

It's not a bad place to get some good wings and some beers. Especially when you compare them to other wing places in the area. BWW has some of the best flavors to choose from including sauces that are actually hot not ones that claim to be hot. If you name a sauce suicide or diablo it better be eye watering, mouth burning, poop on fire the next day hot! Blazin and mango habanero do that for me. The service is pretty good and usually fast. Plenty of tv's to watch your sports games, air conditioned, and a decent amount of beers on tap. The wings here are the biggest I have seen around... Can't complain.

Every time my family and I have ordered from here it has been delivered fast and hot. We usually always order the teriyaki chicken pizza because it is our favorite, we love the sauce. The crust is fluffy and delicious. We have not been disappointed yet. This is our go to pizza place especially because of the price and flavor, you can't beat it.

First time here, I liked the ambience and the plethora of tv's. Beer selection was good. The slider sampler was delicious! Can't wait to come to this place at night when not as many kids are present. I don't like it when parents let there kids climb all over other tables and touch everything, that is my only complaint.

The flavor is there but the rolls are ridiculously small... Even with the yelp coupon it was a rip off... I have never been to any sushi restaurant and had rolls that's small. I won't ever come here again.

It was pretty damn good. I had the sage chicken and egg Benedict (MvF) and it was delicious! The portion size was huge! We waited for a table for about 35 minutes but once we were seated our orders were taken quickly and the food arrived fast. I suggest ordering one of their bloody Mary's while you wait because they are quite tasty and help with hangovers... Especially the one I had. Haha.

I love the new owners! They are really nice. The first couple times we came in it was a little rocky but that was because they had a whole bunch of brand new employees. We even had our waiter walk out on our table half way through dinner...the main reason we can back was because the owners were so nice and the food was still delicious. We have been back three times now and it gets better and better! We even have a favorite hibachi chef his name is Jessie. He cooks everything on point and to your liking plus he delivers a great show. My husband and I recently tried one of the sushi rolls *time square roll* and it was amazing. I am very happy to have found a hibachi restaurant close to my house.

I'm going to give this place 5 stars because it is the best buffet I have been to. I have been to a handful of asian buffets and the dinner buffet here surpasses them all with there wide variety of seafood, Chinese food, and sushi. I kid you not that this sushi is a step above most buffet sushi. They bring out the crab legs all the time unlike most places as well as the salt and pepper crabs which are delectable. I am a big seafood lover and this place scratches my itch for a low price.

It was delicious and the service was great! My boyfriend and I started with the shrimp and pork spring rolls which had an amazing peanut dipping sauce. We also had crispy shrimp egg rolls which were very tasty as well. We ordered one of the specials which was the shaken beef with shrimp and garlic noodles. The seasoning was tasty and the meat was cooked perfectly, so was the shrimp. Everything was delicious. We will be coming back again.

I give this place two stars and on a busy weekend 3. My family and i come here every once in awhile when we want a chinese buffet, it is the closest to where we live. The food is okay but it isn't always the freshest especially when they are slow. A lot of lukewarm food and sometimes the meat sits and gets tough. Plus they rarely restock the crab legs and when they do it isn't much. The service is great though.

My boyfriend and I stop in at 1:40pm on a Sunday to grab a quick bite to go. Get up to the register to order and the wait time is an hour?!!!! Are you effing kidding me? No food place should be an hour wait especially when the food isn't anything hard to cook. Get it together Jims burgers and eggs, maybe hire more help because with that wait time you will lose customers. Maybe we will be back on a weekday to try the food.

Came here for my cousins baby shower and got the Sunday brunch. It was very good! Especially with the bottomless mimosas! Everything was hot and flavorful! Loved the eggs Benedict and crab legs!! The scrambler was full of flavor, I added mushrooms and ham. The waffles were fluffy and yummy as well. I will be taking my family here in a couple weeks. If you do not have a big appetite do not go because unless you can eat a lot you won't get your 22 dollars worth... For a not so big girl... I can eat! ;)

The wait time is a little long but I guess that is expected from a made to order place. Other than that everything was delicious. I ordered the Bacon Burger with mayo, grilled mushrooms, and grilled onions. It was one of the best burgers I have had that wasn't from a steakhouse. I also loved their fries, the seasoning is on point.

The staff seemed to be really nice. It was my daughters first visit and they made her feel very comfortable ( she's 3 and a half) they have a cool play room in the waiting room and a TV for them to watch when they are laying back in the dentist chair. After her teeth were checked and cleaned some she received a disney tooth brush, a small treasure box toy, a sticker, and a balloon. All in all it was a pleasant experience for us and we will be back in 6 months.

I ordered the drunken noodles with shrimp at a 5 for spice level. I love hot and spicy food so next time I will most likely try a spice level of 6 or 7. It was very good especially for the lunch portion. The service was pretty fast and the employees were very nice and attentive. It is a small family owned place so I suggest ordering take out since there aren't many places to sit. Very good Thai food and I will be back again. The spice level is pretty on point compared to other Thai places I have tried. The shrimp we big a plump, not jenky like some other places might be and you also get plenty of noodles. Yelp was down when I went so my check in didn't go through.

I ordered delivery and my food arrived pretty fast. I ordered the beef pad Thai which was the best pad Thai I have had in a long time. The spice level was hot and got me sniffling a little bit but I love spice so I was just testing the waters, next time I will try Thai hot. My stepson ordered the chicken chow mein mild which he said was ok but I don't always trust the palette of a 14 year old. We shared an order of spring rolls which were pretty good. I'd definitely recommend eating here, I'll update you the next time I go.

I don't see how this place has 2 stars... My family and I went to watch Godzilla in IMAX and 3D and it was awesome. Popcorn was good and so was my icee. Maybe it isn't as fancy as other theaters but it was fine. We will be back.

My bf and I were a little skeptical based on the 3 starts but decided to try it out anyways. The decor is awesome and definitely western. It is very clean including the bathrooms. When we first sat down we received our drinks fast but after that the service definitely slacked. My boyfriend finally said something to one of the managers and after that it was smooth sailing. Jennifer who is the kitchen manager took over for whoever was supposed to be out server. She was outstanding and even gave us a complimentary starter because of our issue. The Texas tanion (sp?) was outstanding. My boyfriend ordered the outlaw rib eye which he said was the best tasting steak he has had in ten years. I ordered the primetime burger which was one of the best burgers I have ever had, it was so juicy. We will definitely be back again. Started off shaky but ended amazing.

Alright, I came back again and I feel a little better about the place... My fried egg still wasn't runny even after I told her to make sure it was... I'm thinking it just cooked more on my drive home so I won't totally blame it on them. It was piping hot and delicious! I added extra bacon and opted for sautéed onions instead of regular ones. I got the fried zucchini this time which was on point and delicious. Next time I think I'll get pulled pork added to it instead of the fried egg. If you want a good burger go here it really is good.

I have been on a steak kick lately and Texas road house did a great job at fixing that and more. I love the ambiance of the place and once you are seated the service is pretty fast. We made sure to make reservations for Saturday night because this place gets packed! The food was delicious! The steak was overcooked but the manager fixed that right away with a new steak for my husband and I. We will be coming back for sure!

My husband and I went to try Osaka for our weekly date night. Based on a fellow yelpers pictures and review. We love sushi and have gotten tired of our other sushi place. We sat at the sushi bar and ordered two of the playboy rolls I asked for them both to be extra spicy, it was delicious! My husband then ordered the citrus roll and I ordered the tequila roll. The tequila tasted similar to the playboy so next time I will try a different roll. Still good though! The citrus was very good as well. The chef made us something special which was sliced peppered ahi ( on the house) oh my yum it was good! We also ordered octopus, white tuna, and albacore nigiri and again we were not disappointed. The fish was all very fresh and dressed perfectly! Presentation was beautiful. We loved our server which was a tall white gentlemen, wish I got his name. Beer was served in a chilled glass ( which I love). We tried the shumai appetizer which were good but could have been bigger dumplings, for 5 bucks I can't complain too much. I wouldn't mind trying the teppanyaki side but I don't want to be disappointed with my choice since the sushi was delicious. All in all it was a great experience we will be back soon.

Went through the drive thru and the service was amazing. The girl that took my order at the window was awesome! Plus I got my iced white mocha fairly fast! It was my first time trying Dutch brothers and it was so good. I like that they use chocolate milk instead of regular milk... Not for anyone counting calories lol.
