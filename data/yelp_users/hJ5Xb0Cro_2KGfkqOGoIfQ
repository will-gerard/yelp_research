Came in on a Monday night and wanted to order a soup to take out. There was about maybe 7 customers inside and there was a lot of empty seats. Walk in the door and an older guy smiled and I said I wanted to order something to go, right away he said they cannot accept take outs for they are busy (which it doesn't look like they are busy at all). Hate to give a bad review but I am disappointed :(

My go to place whenever I miss home cooked meals. They have the most friendliest workers. They greet you right away with happiest face whenever you come in. I have to say my favorite is the paksiw na tilapia with bittermelon and eggplant. Superb service all the time!
