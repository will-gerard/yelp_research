the folks at my work would order this food quite often.  This doesn't say much  considering my coworkers love for strange underwhelming establishments.  You could fry a roach, call it Orange Chicken, and my coworkers will back weekly!(see Ben V.'s review)  I ordered delivery one time and was grossed out enough that I ended up throwing everything away after the first bite.  I eventually implemented a rule that we would no longer provide business to this restaurant after a terrible call we received from them.  Our company would order delivery almost weekly and would always throw quite a bit of money at this business.. Furthermore the tip would always be VERY generous.  Until one day we left a tip of... (please play dramatic countdown piano riff in your head here) 10 DOLLARS!  AHHHHHH!!! With the next order that was placed, the business contacted us to complain of the size of our tip, stating they weren't sure if they could deliver our current order if we are only going to tip blah blah blah.  Thats right, they complained about only getting a 10 dollar tip for the delivery. (the bill was only about 40-50 dollars) .  You are far better off sticking to local joints that are not only delicious but are grateful for your business. (TOTT's, dragon express, etc....)

Lgo..lgo..l...g..ooooooooo!! This place is always amazing. The pizza is always great...amazing burgers and salads as well.  the grocery store is attached next door and is a great place to pick up your favorite drink, Tammie coe cupcake, or small gift. Also a great breakfast! One of the easiest 5 star reviews.

Went to this place after purchasing a living social deal. I was impressed with their happy hour as well as the sushi belt that tempts you the entire meal. Flat out amazing oysters. Average sushi. Amazing oysters.

Wow, where to start where to start.  after completing culinary school I realize the challenge in cooking vegan, its very easy to over season or under season items.  The owner seems to have vegan cooking down pat.  I have stopped by twice in the past week spending way more than I planned on spending simply because I was tempted into testing out the flavors offered.  As an example...... Her bacon..... She first makes Tofu from scratch, then cuts thin slices, bakes those slices, then finishes on a grill with some seasoning, it doesn't necessarily taste like bacon, but the taste is intense and delicious.  The juice bar is also very extensive (some items are not even on the menu like my favorite... the Grinia Colada....) The Grinia Colada has got a handful of greens juiced alongside a few fruits coconut milk and lime.  Mindblowing!  If you are looking for a spot to fill up without the guilty, "I should run a 5k after this meal," feeling, stop by 24 carrots.

I had a hankering for a good noodle dish last week and happened upon this gem of a thai joint.  Over the past year I have stopped in regularly for both the pad see ew as well as the pad thai.  They have also added thai sandwiches for 3.99 lately! This is a great spot for soups, dessert's, noodle dishes, and curries.  If you are in the chandler fashion square area do yourself a favor and swing by the Thai cafe!

If you have never been before you should really try harder... Your mother taught you better than that. Go and buy a smoked pecan paleta.

This place is a nice little spot in downtown Chandler they have an awesome selection of local brews as well as a great wine selection. Unfortunately, the food was impressively mediocre. The salad and fries were obviously thrown together in a few seconds .fries appeared to be store bought thick steak fries... The meat was high quality and so was the service. Beyond my overall impression was blahh.

This place is a great alternative to the usual options in downtown scottsdale.  There is a very extensive menu with some pretty bold options.  The actual meal was very delicious, and the decor was amazing.  With that being said I will deduct a star for mediocre service.  I couldn't help but feel was though our waiter was in a hurry to serve, no smiles were given.  The beautiful people of scottsdale all were packed in, so its a cool place if you are looking to people watch,(my father would love it.)

So we come to Sushi Room often and have always enjoyed ourselves.  I definitely echo the majority of the reviews stating that prices are high  and service is slow.  This has never been a huge concern as my gf and I time our visits around their specials(which are awesome).  Monday nights are half price roll nights and I would highly recommend visiting on Mondays. The truffled steak roll, as well as the Primo are worth the money. The reason for my review, and for the two stars is due to a rather unremarkable experience  tonight.   So my gf and I planned our trip tonight to get the half priced rolls special.  We also had a groupon for $30.  We understood that we would not be able to spend this 30 dollars on specials or happy hour.. as is the case with most groupons. So prior to placing our order we explained to the server that the 30 dollar groupon can be applied to the $40 dollars worth of normally priced items on our order and the other $30 dollars in rolls will be at half price.  The server was befuddled and explained that they can't do that, I asked to speak to the manager who was equally befuddled.  I explained that we have followed the directions on the groupon, and we're now entitled to the same specials as all the other patrons were.  He broke down the expense of providing groupon deals, and implied I can't get that kind of a deal and also get half priced rolls.  I asked him if we could get half priced rolls if we paid for our first order with our groupon, paid our check, then left, came back through the front door and started a new order for half priced rolls, HE SAID NO!  I begged him to accept my business, to which he said it was too expensive. It was one of the strangest experiences I have ever had in a restaurant.

this is a great little hidden spot, I took a client there over the weekend and we both ate a great breakfast for under 10 dollars.  Their prima breakfast sandwich will inspire your breakfasts at home.  (I just purchased all the ingredients to recreate at home.)  If you are in the area you really should give this place a shot

My family went to Dottie's after our first trip to San Francisco, we did not stop by the San Fran location, so I am unable to compare the two.  However, The fact that people speak so highly of dotties in San Fran says plenty given San Fran's amazing restaurant picks.  Overall the service was fairly slow and not necessarily the best I have ever had. However, the food, the bacon, the sausage, the pancakes, were all delicious.  One of my favorite spots in the valley for breakfast is Matt's Big Breakfast, and this breakfast as far as taste is concerned was comparable.  You won't have to wait nearly as long either!  Now while I can't promise amazing service or no wait, I can tell you your food will be worth both.

I dont usually care much for bbq spots. I find them to be usually overpriced and uninspired.  This place just seems to have bbq down to a science.  Furthermore my girlfriend and I filled up for 15 bucks! A definite must see for bbq lovers as well as foodies

First visit today, and I was thoroughly impressed!  I have an awful dentist phobia, nonsensical, but awful nonetheless. Anyways, I had walked by this business a number of times (neighbors of whole foods as well as fired pie!) And decided to give them a try. Every person I dealt with was professional and fun to be around, which worked wonders on my anxiety.  Their office was definitely modern, with flat panels everywhere as well as cool instruments I had never seen at my prior dentist's office.  Furthermore, they offered an awesome deal to new customers!If you are in the market for a new dentist/orthodontist check this place out!

Wow! What a great place!  To be brutally honest, I was expecting a mediocre pizza, produced with a very interesting business idea, being that I could build it myself. I couldn't have been more wrong.  The quality of everything they offered was top notch.  Furthermore, the staff was very helpful and friendly.  I will be going back ASAP.

Food is solid. Better than our cities other thai options for sure! Veggie fried rice is great, not greasy, and properly cooked. The spicy tofu with cashew is Damn delicious. I'll return often for that dish alone. Incredibly friendly staff as well!
