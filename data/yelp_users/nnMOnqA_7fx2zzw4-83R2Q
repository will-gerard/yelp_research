Went to Phoenix today visiting our son.  One of our favorite things to do is to find new Ethnic Restaurants.  We had some chores to do in and around Scottsdale and were craving some good Indian lunch Buffet.  We had heard about this place being a tasty and reasonable place to eat.  Funny, we got there fairly early even before noon on a Friday and the parking lot was full.  A good sign.  We walked into a beautifully appointed clean place with white table cloths, red napkins and that was another pleasant surprise The price for the buffet is $8.95 per person and well worth that. They were constantly filling up the trays.    The salad was crispy lettuce, tomatoes with an assortment of Indian dressings, a chutney, and some other wonderful dressing.  The chick pea salad was so good that I devoured 2 plates of that.  They also had a large bowl of what looked to be taco chips.  However, they were homemade and so crunchy with Indian flavoring.  I could have just eaten that alone.  I was pretty stuffed at this point.  The main dishes were Tandoori chicken, Curry chicken with a great sauce.  Another curry dish with potatoes and onions.   Of course rice and paneer which was also yummy.  A couple of simosa fritters which were a little tough but was still tasty.  Three different deserts.  Rice pudding was great to take the bite out of some of the moderately spicy  dishes.  Also a carrot pudding which if your'e Jewish reminded me of Tsimis. Not sure how to spell it.    There was also like a sponge cake ball fried crispy.  I just threw that into the rice pudding to end the meal.  The place was packed by the time we left about 1.30PM or so.  Lots of business people enjoying some heavenly treats.  Good price, good service.  What more can one ask for. No dinner for me tonight.

If you want to find a "real authentic" restaurant that's been in Arizona since 1968 then Carolina's is where you want to be. The neighborhood is  run down and you might not want to walk around there at night.  Saturday afternoon for lunch is pretty cool..  If you don't mind the bullet holes in the windows.   If you like the ambiance of a mess hall with grungy concrete floors.   No pictures of anything on the walls.   And you don't get turned off by this.   If you want  to take a date here, don't.     Personally, we love to try places in the heart of a Mexican neighborhood because you get the real deal.  The real folks who come to this Phoenix institution, however there are quite a few gringos like us.     As soon as you get your order you will find the food is oh so good.  You know you are in the right place.  You order at a counter and can see into the kitchen.  There must have been 20 ladies making homemade chips and tortillas.  The prices are really great and they have a rather basic menu.  I had the chicken enchilladas which were wonderful.  Usually, I get the green sauce but I forgot to mention that and so it was the red sauce which was incredibly good.  Hubby had the enchilladas with beef and it was equally as good.  Going to Carolina's is not just for the food.  It is the whole experience which you get upon entering it.  I took home some home made tortillas.  They are without a doubt the best ones I've had.  You can get lots of food by the dozen, but being I live in Tucson it is too far to have them make the trip back home.  Besides I would have nibbled on them going home.  So all in all, if you can deal with the ambiance of the place and just want some "down home" Mexican cooking, by all means give Carolina's a try.

Definitely a must if you are near South Mountain Park in Phoenix which we were.  Quant  atmosphere and decorated totally Mexican style.  Not the best neighborhood but that's what adds to the ambience of the place.  Very inexpensive and huge portions.  I ordered the  Chicken Relleno which you rarely see on a Mexican menu.  It was $5.50.  Filled up the whole plate with a delicious serving of moist white meat chicken in a  chile relleno topped with a yummy sauce loaded with sauteed onions, mild chilles and of course cheese poured all over with a small salad.  Hubby ordered a combo of tamales, chicken enchillada, chile rellenos.  Had to bring half home.  Equally yummy.  Our son had the chicken enchilldas and scarfed down his meal in seconds.  It will be one of our favorites when traveling up to Phoenix.

Love this place.  Every time we make the trip from Tucson to Phoenix I get this craving for Poncho's.  The building must have been an old house from the 1930's and converted into a restaurant.  There are so many nooks and crannys to get lost in.  But when you make your way in you are greeted by this lovely older lady who is full of piss and vinegar with a great sense of humor who leads you to your table.  We were there Sat. at about 2.00PM.  The place was packed with large families who seem to know the wait staff pretty well.  Everyone is so friendly and efficient which is a plus. Now to the real test.  The food is wonderful, rich in flavor and beautifully  presented.  Unfortunately, I am a wuss and order the same gringo dish (Chicken Enchilladas with green sauce)  Hubby orders Chile Relleno, tamale, combo plate.  The thing is those onions which are sauteed to perfection slathered all over the dish including the rice. This makes me real happy.  If you love onions this is surely the place.  It's a "must go" when heading up to Phoenix.

I'm originally an  east coast patron of Chinese Food and after living in Arizona for 18 years I have mostly been disappointed in the caliber of Chinese Food.  Not much compares to N.Y. Cantonese.  A lot of restaurants are more sophisticated these days and call themselves Asian Fusion food.  Love that, but sometimes I'm looking for some solid Cantonese for the purist in me.  When visiting in Phoenix we came across a family owned "gem" of a place.  It's located in a small shopping plaza that has been affected by the downturn in the economy.  Lots of the stores have closed.  There is a big Ace Hardware at one end of the center.  That is a solid business.  The owners are really so pleasant, the restaurant is spotless as well.  They have wonderful lunch specials with great prices.  The size of the lunch plate is enormous.  Besides that the dishes are delicious and come out piping hot.  This is the only place to go when we go up to Phoenix to visit our son.  Love it.

Haven't been here in awhile being we do live in Tucson.  We get up to this area when visiting our son.  So when not hitting the gamut of Mexican restaurants we went to our favorite Chinese restaurant in the Phoenix area.  You can't beat the lunch specials.  Three of ate for $22 bucks.  Best thing is lunch is served daily until 4 PM.  It's a very welcoming place.  The owners are so nice and friendly.  The place is so clean.  It might be the white tablecloths that adorn the tables.  The menu is typically Cantonese with the usual dishes.  Everything is very tasty.  We shared the lo mein, mongolian beef and empress chicken.  The serving sizes are humungous.  So needless the say we had no dinner later.

We visit our son in Phoenix fairly often and when we go up there, we enjoy trying new places to add to our repertoire of ethnic delicacies. Whether, Chinese, Mexican, Greek.  We are open for anything.   I checked out this place on Yelp for reviews and all of them were great.   I was looking forward to finding a "gem" of a Mexican restaurant.  We all agreed that the dishes were mediocre.  It wasn't the cleanest place either.  I ordered my usual chicken enchilladas  with green sauce.  Very tasty and a little different.  They marinate the chicken, pork, and beef which makes the chicken, pork and beef a little bit mushy.  The rice was tasty though.  My other half ordered the chille relleno which was also a little bit different from what we are used to.  It was served in a brown sauce with cheese, onions, and diced potatoes.  Pretty tasty. He also had a lengua (tongue) taco. Small but also very tasty. There is no waiter service.  You go up to the counter and order.  I'm not crazy about the plastic plates, but no tipping is a good plus.  We went for lunch about 2.00PM and the place was crowded.  So obviously lots of people enjoy this place.  The menu was plentiful with lots of choices.   I understand the place was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins-and Dives.  I guess you could label this place in the Dive category.  Prices were quite reasonable.  All and all, if you like Mexican Street food, Los Taquitos might fit the bill. I'm not sure if we will return or not.  We will still try other places to finally find Mexican Food Heaven.  Even if nothing is perfect, the journey to get to it is the best part.

We were going up to Phoenix and decided to have a late breakfast about 11.00 AM.  After debating where to go perusing mentally  through the usual chain restaurants, Denny's, IHOP etc. we decided to give Cracker Barrel a shot.  The place was very crowded and had to wait 15min.  Not too bad.  We figured it would be slow service once we got seated.  No problem.  A waitress came right over to us and took our order.  They have huge selections of interesting breakfast combos as well as lunch choices even before noon.   I got the 2 scrambled eggs with 3 dry crispy slices of bacon, it came with a wonderful light yogurt parfait with nuts, raisins, fresh fruit.  I had some of my husband's pancakes which I believe it was about 4 huge ones with his order of 2 eggs, bacon and it came with the pancakes.  Very reasonably priced.  Food came in about 10 minutes.  Nice and hot and really very very good. The little country store is adorable and fun to walk through it.

Unlike some of the flea markets I've been to this one stands out at being one of the best albeit for one I went to in Pasadena Calif. many years ago.   First of all, there is no fee for parking or an entrance fee.  So this is a big plus for me.  It was jammed packed with cars but with patience you get a parking spot pretty quickly.  Apparently they added another day to it.  Now it includes Fridays as well.  So it goes on all year from Friday to Sunday.  A really great way to spend a couple of hours browsing through the covered tents.   It looks to be around 1/2 mile long with about 4 aisles packed with "stuff".  It's basically the usual stuff you get almost everywhere. Tee's, Sweatshirts, leather goods, shoes, tools, jewelry cleaners, jewelry,  loads of foods vendors and a great big food court.  Not my cup of tea, but it is available.  I'm not a golfer, but lots of booth with  clubs etc.  Chatchkas (Yiddish) word for a lot of "things"some useful and some not.  It's great if you want to get some exercise and walk for a couple of hours and have some fun wandering about.  They even had some cheese made in Arizona like the Wisconsin cheddar.  Something a friend of mine from Wisconsin used to bring back for me. They are small pieces that just melt in your mouth.   Didn't have a cooler so didn't pick it up.  Overall a good place to pass some time and get off your butt.

Have not been here in quite awhile.  Mistake, When in Phoenix we are always trying out new places to keep up with my "Yelp" searches.   So unfortunately, being this is a chain restaurant which I do not ascribe to,  I put Abuelo's on the back burner.  Starting  with the chips and salsa was a real treat.  The chips are very thin, crispy and no grease.  Less calories.  Gotta start somewhere with calorie counting when it comes to Mexican food.  The salsas were awesome.  The green one is the best I ever had.  I could just munch on chips and the green salsa and forget the food.  I asked the server what it comprised of.  To my surprise, it was mixed with fresh pineapple and cilantro. We all ordered an assortment of the usual Mexican fare, enchilladas, chille rellanos, The rice was very tasty as well as mashed potatoes Mexican style which was awesome.  It is called Papas.  Huge portions.  The restaurant itself is a nice setting,  like you are sitting in an outdoor plaza.  I do wish they would come to the Tucson area.

My son told us about this place and what a wonderful treat this was.  We live in Tucson but go to Phoenix quite frequently because our son lives there so we try new restaurants there as well.  This place has an unusual twist as it is certainly Mexican but with the Greek influence.  My first impression when we walked in was it seemed clean, warm and extremely friendly.  The service was super.  Three people and three bowls of chips and yummy salsa for each of us.  The chips were warm and obviously home made.  The menu is outstanding and interesting choices.  I had the carne asada which had  a hint of lemon and gave it the flavor of a gyro.  My hubby ordered Eggplant enchilladas and he loved it.  Good prices, great service, and best of all cheap Margaritas.  $1.75 all day any time. A little weak but that was OK.  I'll certainly return to try more of the offerings.

A little background on the Mexican state of Hidalgo where this style of food emanates from.  It's located somewhere between Vera Cruz and Mexico City.  It's rich in history dating back to the Aztecs.  Lots of indigenous people that make up much of the population.  Mainly a Catholic country but a fairly large Jewish population dating back to the Spanish Inquisition where some Jews settled in Hidalgo to escape a doomed fate.  The restaurant is located in the Hispanic section of Tempe on University Blvd. It's in a small strip shopping center.  Not fancy by any means, but if your yearn for authentic Hidalgo/Mexico City style food then you are truly in for a treat.  If you are like some Gringos who always ask " Is the dish spicy"? You might not want to come here.  Some dishes are meant to be spicy and that's just how it is prepared.  You can find dishes with less of a kick though.  The menu is quite large and you have some very different recipes you don't find everywhere.   One side of the menu is written in Spanish and the other side is English.  Lots of street tacos to chose from.  Example Longaniza Con Nopoles (mild sausage and cactus).  Hubby ordered it and I tasted.  It was so delicious. The street tacos are cheap.  $1.75.  It was a pretty good size.  Main dish he ordered was Beef Tongue (Lingua) in a Burrito.  It was a huge burrito stuffed to the gills with of course rice and beans.  Lots of Combination plates, sea food, soups, Tortas, Specials on the weekends of BBQ lamb dishes.  The young lady who waited on us was so sweet.  She is the niece of the owner.  So you get that family feeling here.  If your looking for a trendy beautiful place then you better turn around. If you are looking for something very special this is the place.  I had the Chicken Enchiladas with green sauce.  Very yummy with a definite different take on it.  It has a hint of lime in the flavor.  When your food is served it is brought over with a bowl of chopped onions (incredibly sweet) a bowl of chopped cilantro, and a bowl of lemons. Like a salsa bar brought to your table.  The chips and salsa was another story.  The chips were meaty and dry which we like.  The red salsa is really hot, the avocado creme salsa was wonderful.  First bite was very hot and then either you get used to it or get addicted to it.  My the second bowl of it I was scared I would have heartburn from it.  Absolutely didn't happen.  One of the owners came over to us to see if we enjoyed our meal.  Very sweet lady.  Let me add this comment.  On all of our plates was not a sign of any oil used in cooking it.  I hate when a dish is sitting in a puddle of oil.  Will be back here again.

We've been here before so this is just to remind you to enjoy the experience of a restaurant aka market, butcher, deli and middle eastern bakery all under one roof. =. When you are in the Tempe area it is a real treat.  They make their own pita bread sold fresh and warm so you can pick up a package before you leave.  Wonderful assortment of baklava as well.   The owner is a delightful friendly man from Tunisia.  He makes you feel very comfortable and eager to please his customers.   We ordered an assortment of wonderfully prepared Middle Eastern dishes.  The servings are enormous.  I had the gyro sandwich which was so packed with the beef and lamb gyro meat. It was a challenge to eat.   We also ordered the chicken patty dish which was seasoned just right.  The rice was wonderful with a side dish of a garlicky sauce.  The hummus is absolutely the best especially if you are a garlic lover.   The server hailed from Morocco and happy to tell about his life spent there.  I can't say enough good things about this wonderful Cafe.  P.S. If you go on a Saturday the meters are running so make sure you put in your money.  You can easily get a ticket.  Only free parking on Sunday otherwise you must put your change in the meters.  It is different in Downtown Phoenix where Sat. and Sun. are free.  Same as Tucson, so beware before you park outside.

You've got to try this one out.  Wish it were here in Tucson.  , but we do travel to Phoenix many times during the year.   It's always a treat to search out different restaurants and hope we find some winners along the way.  This one just hit the spot. Love family restaurants that have these enduring recipes that date back years and years.  Mama cooking at the stove feeding several kidlets some ethnic family dishes.  Then maybe one day some tells Mama to open up a restaurant and serve everyone, gringos, Mexicans, other ethnicities some of their best dishes.  I believe this is the place where it formed.  Not sure, but it makes a nice story.  Anyhow, it was tucked away in an area around downtown Phoenix.  On the outskirts.  Not a great neighborhood but that makes it even better.  I ordered the Chicken Chimichanga topped with lots of chunky guacamole, sour cream and cheese on top. On the side came the green Enchillada sauce.  It was the best I ever had.  Big chunks of very soft mild chillies were floating in the sauce.  Husband had the Chili  Relleno.  It was delectable and the batter was light and fluffy. Son had the grilled fish enchiladas which was also so good.  Our very lovely server was Brianna.  Not only was she efficient, she was adorable and had a super sense of humor.  We went about 1:30 PM on Saturday.  The place was packed.  P.S. the chips were great as well and the salsa.  Mild with huge chunks of tomatoes.  Will be back again when in Phoenix.

I really didn't want to put just one star so I relented and gave it 2 stars.  We were in Phoenix getting together with some friends who were there on a business trip..  So somehow we wound up at My Big Fat Greek Restaurant downtown Phoenix.  We live in Tucson and I heard that this chain in just fair.  But majority ruled.  There was a reason I didn't want to go, it was pretty bad.  I had the gyro.  Hard to mess that up, but they sure knew how.  Tasteless and dry.  Hubby had the mousakka  and some very spicy potatoes.  Save your money and skip this one.  I guess a lot of people may not know what good Greek food is like.  Best to try a non chain place.   When we come up to Phoenix we usually go to Phoencia in Tempe.  Now that's good. Sorry guys, I don't like to nix restaurants, but just want to let you know all the facts.

Almost a five.  I do have to be discrete with my stars.  Had lunch here very recently and everything we ordered was yummy. Been here before and feel it meets my pretty high standards for Mediterranean Food.  I believe the owners really try to make you happy with the food they serve.  It's great because of the casualness of the place.  Pretty clean as well.  You order up front and they bring you your dish.  I ordered the Gyro Sandwich and it was so huge.  I almost had trouble finishing it.  Don't believe that for a sec.  The meat was moist, tasty, tender with red onions on a slightly grilled pita bread.  Also got an order of the yellow rice.  Fluffy and light.  Hubby had the falafel.  He enjoyed it but it didn't look to good to me.  Dark brown and crispy.  He liked it though.  Another order of the chicken shawarma which tasted well spiced to perfection.  The salad that came with the falafel was chock full of cucumbers, peppers, onions, in a delicious dressing.  It was all cut into very small cubes.  Really tasty.  Would definitely come back for a reasonable prices meal , good prompt service.

On our monthly visits to our son up in Phoenix we always like to find fun things to explore that are a little bit funky.  We certainly came across the right place for this.  Spent a good 2 hours enjoying all the stylish, "out of the box" fun stuff.  That's what it is.  Just STUFF coming out of the woodworks.  The prices are so reasonable.  That makes this place even more of a Ganga.  From vintage clothing to every possible item you can image.  I surely will go back to see if I can find that special something I can't live without.  I've been trying to live a more minimalist life but it's so much fun to see what really hits your fancy.

First time here mostly because I live in Tucson.  When visiting family we like to try out some new places to add them to my list of favorite places to go.  The weather has been getting a bit cooler and that changes my inclinations for types of food.  So a recommended Indian Lunch Buffet caught  my radar today.  Very nice atmospheric place which gets me in the mood to feel like I am in India.   This is southern Indian food at its best.  They have the usual dishes set out like tandoori chicken loaded with sautéed onions which was very tasty.  Lamb curry was tasty though it seemed to be swimming in oil.  After draining out the oil albeit the lamb was soft and yummy. The Paneer was cooked in a wonderful sauce.  Chicken masala was great with very tender chicken pieces.  Many vegetable dishes that were quite tasty.  Also a great salad bar with raita dressing.  Basmati rice pudding with almonds and pistachios plus a mango creamy pudding.  Both wonderful.   Included was unlimited mango milk shakes from an unlimited urn.  The nam bread came around several times and it was really good. All in all it's a great place for lunch at just under 9 bucks.  It solved my problem for eating another meal that day.  Two huge plates was enough fuel for this day.  The staff was pleasant.  Kind of business like.  They start cleaning up at exactly 2.30 when the buffet ends.  The buffet is from 11.00 am to 2.30pm on the dot.  They close until dinner from 5.00pm to l0.00 pm.
