The Thai food here is relatively Americanized, but hey, it tastes great regardless. The portions are large and they offer a wide variety of dishes. One unique feature to Wild Thaiger is that in addition to being a Thai restaurant, it's a Thai bar as well. They offer many Asian beers and Indochina-themed cocktails. They have seating indoors and out with a patio view of Central Avenue. The restaurant can be a bit easy to miss, especially for those used to Phoenix' usual parking-in-front cityscape, as it is in an older part of the city with the parking lot through an alley, behind the building. The food is delicious and the drinks are really good.

This place has so much going for it. When you enter from the north, you would expect a grand stage, as the entry is through a gateway in the Phoenix Art Museum, well-lit with colorful LEDs. Before the show, there's a courtyard with sculptures you can look at while you wait, and there's a bistro across from the theater where you can have dinner or a glass of wine before a show. Inside, however, the theater is quite small. The downside is that it means some shows can sell out quickly, but it also means you're pretty much guaranteed a good seat. Seating is "cozy" and intimate, which is mostly good for shows, but it's also my only real complaint. The chairs aren't very comfortable and they're packed in like those on an airplane.  I typically go to see the Nearly Naked shows (no, not always in the nude) as they never disappoint. The shows are really good. Too good, sometimes, for a theater with limited seating. Oftentimes the shows sell out, so they can take some advance planning. They have seat cushions to make the chairs more comfortable, but I'm not sure if they belong to Nearly Naked only or for all companies performing there, as I haven't seen performances by any other company.  Part of me wants to get opera glasses, but they are unnecessary at this theater. It would've looked funny to use those for "Debbie Does Dallas: The Musical" though. Still, I've seen "Rent", "The Rocky Horror Show", "Evil Dead: The Musical", "Blood Brothers", "Killer Joe", "Times Square Angel", "The History of the Devil", "Valhalla" and many others in this theater, and compared to others I've been to, you get a much better experience with top-quality productions in this smaller setting.

I have to give this place 5-stars. The cheese plates are small and everything is a bit pricey, but I feel it's well worth it. Windows surround the building to the east and north. You can gaze out on Central Avenue and watch passers-by, cars and the light rail. The area suggests Phoenix is coming of age into a more distinctive urban area, rather than its notorious sprawling suburban-esque cityscape. It's in a gentrifying neighborhood that's quickly becoming a more artistic, upscale part of town. They have a lengthy wine and cheese list, the latter offering suggested wine pairings (if you're embarrassed to ask the server.) However, some pairings not suggested may surprise you. The last time I went I was a bit disappointed that my favorite wine they sell (Duck Pond) is only available by the bottle. The cheeses are good, though I've learned from experience to try a small taste of some before taking a larger bite, and I haven't heard of most of them before going here. I enjoy the Nearly Naked Theatre company, which performs at the neighboring Phoenix Art Museum, and always stop in here for a bit of wine and cheese prior to showtime.

Although a bit expensive, Alice Cooperstown is worth a visit. It's built into an old warehouse. The wait staff wears Alice Cooper-esque eyeliner. I'm not a big sports fan, but this is a must-see place for those who are, as there are gigantic televisions that broadcast sports. You'll see several different sporting events at any given time. It's a great spot for carnivores, but they also have some delicious vegetarian options as well. The pasta pomodoro is excellent. They sometimes hold intimate concerts in the outdoor area.

Really good Indian cuisine. Beautiful interior and great food. They'll give you the option of how spicy you want your food on a 1-10 scale. They appear to have a buffet option, though I haven't had the chance to try that yet, as it's for the lunch crowd only.

This place is a relic from the 70s. The seats are uncomfortable, but the circular shape allows for great seats no matter where you sit. I saw George Carlin, Dave Attell and Lisa Lampanelli here and all were great shows on account of the intimate arena-seating configuration. The circular design feels friendlier than the traditional "square" set up, making it feel like the performer is amongst the crowd, rather than before it. It also has convenient smoking areas and places to buy cocktails and refreshments.

This is a comfortable apartment complex in East Phoenix. Close to Loop 202 and SR-143, the Peaks are in a convenient location to the downtown areas in Tempe, Scottsdale and Phoenix. The complex is massive and it can be a bit confusing to navigate. Papago Park is easily accessible from the complex, as there is a gated fence on the east side leading into the park. The complex is clean, modern and safe, has lush landscaping and multiple amenities. The Peaks is home to several swimming pools, volleyball courts, a car wash, gym, grills, racquetball courts, a convenience store and more. The rent is quite reasonable as well. On the downside, it does tend to attract some of the ASU crowd and for that reason can get noisy during the Fall or Spring semesters. Although it's in a pretty convenient location, it isn't in a walkable neighborhood, as you will still need to drive to get to the nearest grocery store, pharmacy, restaurant or entertainment facilities. The light rail line is nearby, but the nearest stop is roughly a 20-minute walk to 44th Street and Washington.   In sum, I would recommend living here as it is very cozy, set in a convenient location and many of the complaints I've read about these apartments seem rather antiquated. I've had no problems with the leasing office and no problems with the actual apartment.

This place is essentially a strip mall, but offers more than the usual strip mall options. The biggest attraction is its architecture, as its designed with  traditional Chinese architecture. The top floors hold office space, the bottom retail and restaurant space. Facing 44th Street is a beautiful garden. There's a large goldfish pond on the south side,with small bridges and walkways over and around it. There are numerous statues and pagodas along the south and east side of the building. It's a beautiful and relaxing addition to the city. There is a large store that sells Asian goods, namely furniture and decorative items. The owners are very nice and friendly. There is also a bridal gown shop and Asian video store next to it. Ranch Market owns a large grocery store that sells Asian foods, though in my opinion LeeLee Market in Chandler has a better selection. There are several restaurants and a coffee shop as well. The Golden Buddha is excellent and the wait staff moves fast. During the day, you can order dim sum from carts the wait staff pushes around the dining floor. The food is excellent and you may be able to get a seat overlooking the aforementioned goldfish pond. It's definitely worth a trip.

This is a nice little boutique offering decorative idols, gemstones, tarot cards, incense, candles, spell books, clothes and more. It has a large New Age, pagan and Wiccan clientele and it's a great place to get goods either for decoration or for use. They always get something new in stock whenever I go. The staff is friendly and very helpful. They offer psychic readings and classes in spirituality.   Admittedly, I'm an atheist and wouldn't buy anything for "spells" or "rituals" but they offer beautiful and interesting items for decoration.

This is definitely one of the better airports in the country. It's clean, easy to navigate and offers a large variety of shops and restaurants. However, the majority of Sky Harbor's pluses are in Terminal 4, home to Southwest, US Airways, British Airways, Hawaiian and a few others. Terminal 2  is rather antiquated and Terminal 3  is "in between." The roads seem to be confusing for a lot of motorists, lanes merge, add and split every which way, and passenger pick-up/drop-off areas often have cars suddenly merging into traffic, all of which can make for a scary drive through the airport. Luckily, there is a light rail connection via complimentary airport connection shuttle. An "air train" is under construction, but it will be a few years before it's operational and terminal transfers can be a bit difficult as there are no walkways between Terminal 4 and the other two, though there is a walkway between 2 and 4. The airport is close to downtown Phoenix and Tempe, which also restricts a lot of building heights in the area. Also, being surrounded by the city puts some restrictions on the airport. It's very compact and handles a lot of passenger traffic, meaning the airport is frequently busy and congested. However, if you have a long layover or extra time to kill before the flight in Terminal 4 you will find plenty of dining/shopping facilities at the usual airport prices.

This is one of Phoenix' most notable geologic features, and is also the world's largest municipal park. You can hike, bike, go horseback riding and more, or just drive up to the top. The city looks peaceful from atop the peak and you may see the Valley's beauty and vast size from that vantage point. After a long, winding, dizzying drive to the top you'll find a rugged parking area and the spectacular view can't be missed. As a warning, the drive to the top can be a bit intimidating and unnerving, considering the blind turns and steep drops. However the splendor at the top is worth the trip. If you're comfortable driving down in the dark, you can watch the city transform from daylight to darkness, all while watching a famed Arizona sunset from the mountain peak, seeing spectacular, fiery colors color the sky to the west, while cooler dark hues slowly creep over the city from east-to-west.

This is a quaint little hamlet east of Phoenix, giving a nod to the bygone days of the Old West. Goldfield sits a short distance from the Superstition Mountains and is full of pioneer charm. It's mostly a tourist trap, but can be a fun trip for families or people wishing to explore the region. Maybe I just have timing, as the following activities never appear to be available when I go, but Goldfield offers tours of the old gold mine, desert tours by jeep, gold-panning, horseback riding and a train ride. Old mining equipment is scattered about the site's grounds, and usual (even clichéd) touristy activities are available. There are shops selling "quintessential" Arizona kitsch, such as baby cacti, sandstone magnets, postcards, etc., old-fashioned candy and popcorn stores, a saloon, restaurant, old-style photographs, reptile museum and more. Goldfield isn't a place you can spend all day though, so while in the area I would recommend visiting the Superstition Mountains and/or taking in the beautiful scenery on the Apache Trail (Highway 88) on the way to Canyon Lake.

This is an excellent store and a great addition to the Phoenix area. It is rather big, roughly the size a larger grocery store. The parking lot is a bit on the scary side and the store is often crowded, but the latter should be a good indication of what to expect inside.  Lee Lee has a nice produce section, full of staple fruits, vegetables, tubers and so forth like carrots, apples and potatoes, but it also has a wide array of specialty foods like Indian eggplant, bok choy, lemon grass and dare you try it, durian. As a vegetarian I can't fairly describe the seafood and butcher section, but I can it's large and inclusive, from catfish to pig uterus. Beyond that there are aisles dedicated to Korea, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Brazil/Caribbean, India, the Middle East, ramen noodles, dried noodles, imported liquor, hefty bags of rice and more.   Lee Lee can be a fun place, but it's largely practical. I find that I can get about two weeks' worth of groceries on one trip. However, I always have to go to my local grocer to get some odds and ends Lee Lee doesn't carry, like bagels, cheese and a few other minor things. Other than that I come out with a large amount of groceries for a reasonable price. Don't let the cultural barrier dissuade you. It's a great place to get nori maki arare, Japanese candies, Thai chilies, chicory coffee, tahini, instant Indian meals, crates of ramen, frozen samosas, chutneys, wasabi, incense, and much, much more, right down to bizarre eats: sake in juice boxes, cheese and corn ice cream, grass jelly, silkworm pupae, canned crickets and unnameable horrors from all corners of the globe.  With that in mind, remember the HSBC marketing campaign of cultural perspectives: delicious in one, disgusting in the other, etc. Give it a shot, try something new while also finding old favorites.

I wanted so much to like Pei Wei. I did. I went twice, getting different dishes both times. My mom raved about it, so I gave it a shot... and while I can't remember what I ate, I do recall bad stomach pains and not being able to get the taste out of my mouth for some time. And by some time, I mean I went here for dinner both times, didn't feel so hot after dinner... then felt awful the entire next day. I have to do my stomach a favor and not touch this food again.

People who live in suburbs understand the necessity of having a car. Because metropolitan Phoenix is a super-sized suburb, all residents understand the value of having a car. In fact, a lot of people have to drive to park-and-rides to use what little public transit there is here. Unfortunately, cars take a beating, go through wear and tear, break down and in sum can just be a real headache. One night I noticed my car needed well over a hundred feet to brake. The Car Shop fixed my car and said I had one broken brake line and the other was swollen. They were fast, professional and the staff was quite likable. It was a very reasonable price to fix both brake lines and they did a little extra work on it at no charge. Next time (and there will be a next time) my car has problems, I'm taking it here.

This shop teaches two lessons when you really need a costume:  1) You never know what you'll find here 2) When in doubt, go to Easley's  I pieced together my costumes the past two Halloweens from several different stores, as the majority of what I needed were regular clothes, but of course there was that one thing I couldn't find anywhere else. So, I went to Easley's. Weird hats, weird masks, weird costumes, accessories, wigs and that other thing you never knew you needed, or realized on the spot would make your costume shine are in this store. Need fake wounds, a rainbow wig or perky foam boobs? If you want to go as a nun, Amy Winehouse, Peggy Bundy, Cleopatra, a ghoul, a vampire penguin, all three Stooges or whatever idea you can conjure up you'll find what you need here. They have rentals and items for purchase for costume parties, holidays, whatever and party favors for kids and adults too.  Two complaints, but they only apply to the month of October: parking is limited and really hard to do when it's busy (meaning it may be easier to park on a side street than in the lot) and consequently, there's so much stuff in here it's a bit tight when it's slow, but Halloween shoppers make it feel really congested.

Most malls in Phoenix are monstrous, indoor facilities. Biltmore Fashion Park is an inside-out alternative full of upscale shops and designer outlets. All stores are in buildings facing outside rather than a series of hallways, allowing shoppers to be out in the open air rather than an air-conditioned labyrinth in a massive building. There isn't a "food court" or cheap eats as is usually a staple of malls, but rather upscale restaurants. Be prepared to expand your shopping budget for this place, as price tags are generally higher. Even if you don't care to go shopping, it's great for people-watching and sunning in the courtyard area, which is full of grass and other greenery. An underground walkway on the south end of the complex connects you to a virtual annex on the opposite side of Camelback, which houses more bars, restaurants, some shops and a movie theater amidst the Ritz Carlton and office buildings. I'm sure I'd drop a bit more money here if I were in a far more comfortable financial situation. One complaint I'd have is that the exits to Camelback or 24th Street can get tricky.

I remember an episode of "Seinfeld" in which Jerry tells the joke: "What's the difference between a dentist and a sadist? Newer magazines!" I think that's funny... but had I never been to any other dentist besides Open Wide Dental, I probably wouldn't have gotten the joke.  I walked in and the staff was courteous and friendly. She offered me a bottle of water to have while I filled out the paperwork and waited for my appointment. Now... next time I go, I'm going to show up extra early, because they have massage chairs. So I was trying to fill out paperwork while getting a shiatsu. Even the decor was a nice change, as it was very calming, modern and chic... as opposed to that typically clinical look most offices have.  I went to get my X-rays, and the assistant was very gentle. I have a horrible gag reflex... so bad that the roof of my mouth, back half of my tongue, anything under my tongue and anything beyond the first set of molars is off limits, but she worked around it and I did fine. Next I did the cleaning... and they actually gave me this sunglasses/visor thing to block out the overhead light. That was great, because seeing that light in combination with prodding and stabbing around in my mouth is reminiscent of near death experience stories. In any case, the assistant was pretty gentle and thorough.   In the end, the entire staff was very nice, gentle and helpful. They are quite accommodating and I think they do a great job of eliminating terror from the dentist experience.

A colossal bar at the end of the Melrose District, perhaps overgrown. It's dark and usually crowded inside. It has a main bar near the entrance, but satellite bars in other parts of the establishment as well. There's a stage for dancing and drag shows and an outdoor area for smoking or fresh air. It's one of Phoenix' landmark gay bars, usually offers drink specials, offers after hours and has a massive amount of space to accommodate more people.   However, much like Amsterdam it's notorious for the clique culture, though drinks are cheaper. And like Amsterdam I would recommend seeing it at least once, but if you aren't going with a group of people, it isn't that special. It's difficult to talk to people and there are virtual designated cruising areas. There are a fair amount of creepers at this bar. It isn't totally sleazy, but the best image I can conjure to depict it is the Disneyland Country Bear Jamboree + medieval dungeon + every gay stereotype. If crowds are your thing, you don't care to hear what your friends are saying and you enjoy several hours of inconsistent music (think alternating Generic Gay Bar Mix and Grand Ole Opry's Greatest Hits) then you might enjoy it.

I'm not an expert on marine pets, nor do I feel I would jump into that hobby feet first. However, enough time spent in the Ocean Floor might make me reconsider. They have aquariums of all sizes and designs, some small enough to house small schools of fish, one large enough to hold a small shark. They have the usual aquatic decor, including rocks, plants, sand, divers, shells and castles, but furthermore have a wide array of different types and designs, allowing fish aficionados to design tanks in unique styles. For beginners, they have a decent library of different types of fish and aquarium care. They have a virtual supermarket for all sorts of marine life. And as for marine life: the store offers a respectable amount of aquatic creatures. They sell fresh- and salt water fish, crabs, shellfish, mollusks, anemones, seahorses and many more sea creatures from all over Poseidon's kingdom. If you're interested in getting starting a tank, I would highly recommend visiting this store.

This is a great place in an extremity of the Valley. They serve both Korean and Japanese food. They are quick and attentive. Having lived in South Korea for two years, I can honestly admit that this is some of the most authentic Korean cuisine I've had in Phoenix. I typically ate bibimbap once a week minimum over there and I can't really tell the difference between Takamatsu's version and the stuff I had on the other side of the Pacific. I noticed they offer a list of other, more obscure foods I learned to love over there, including naengmyeon (cold, spicy noodles), japchae (stir-fried glass noodles), and several other dishes. They also follow tradition and bring you several side dishes. Love it or hate it, kimchi accompanies every meal, as do spicy bean sprouts, a tangy spinach dish and a few other random sides. It's a little bit more expensive than average restaurant prices in the Valley, but definitely worth it when you consider the sides that come with it, and a complimentary spiced tea for "dessert."

I love this vet clinic. The staff is always friendly and helpful, they are open decent and accommodating hours, the clinic is clean and modern, and the doctors never keep you waiting long. It helps that they know what pet-owners want: people to fawn over their animals. From a purely egotistical standpoint, it makes me very happy when people gush over my Bugg (Boston terrier/pug mix) and the vet techs and doctors show him a lot of love and affection. He can be a handful as he gets hyper around people, and poking and prodding at him usually provokes him to play, so checking his mouth, ears, eyes, taking his temperature and all that fun stuff vets must do will always make him squirm. The staff never loses patience with him, but work around his behavior and get their job done. They always give good advice on how to care for him and have really proven their professional approach to pet care. I will continue to use their services to care for little Peanut and any future pets I may get.

Don't be intimidated by this cuisine, it's excellent. Word of advice: go when you feel you're on the verge of dying from starvation. It's extremely filling and the portions are rather large. It's a great vegetarian option, as the veggie side of the menu eclipses the meat section. Some foods are mildly spiced, though the dishes are largely savory. Unfortunately, I can't remember the names of any of the dishes, minus the bread, injera, and the generic name for the dishes, wat. Injera is spongy in texture and the taste is reminiscent of sourdough, the wat dishes are essentially really thick stews that don't require a bowl. My personal favorite dish is the cabbage/carrot mixture. Don't worry that you don't see dinnerware, the server didn't forget. Instead, you tear off pieces of injera and pinch pieces of wat. On top of the basket of injera you'll get on the side, your food will be served on a large piece of it. This place is definitely a destination restaurant on Tempe's "restaurant row" between Priest and McClintock on University.

This place offers excellent Thai cuisine. They offer every dish in multiple levels (or degrees) of heat. I always get Thai hot, as I love spicy food, and they never disappoint. I've had terrible or mediocre experiences with some Thai restaurants in other cities, but this place is excellent. I recommend the signature dish, Thai Basil, as well as their Pad Thai and Red Curry. There are multiple locations, including Central Phoenix and Ahwatukee. If I have anything bad to say about the restaurant, it would be that the University location is pretty small and when the Fall or Spring semesters at ASU are in session it can get packed quickly.

I will say that I do go here, though very sporadically. I gave it two stars, but it's because of my tastes, which I will explain in detail.  When I do go, it's always early in the evening. I don't like going to this bar when it's crowded, as it's excessively crowded. It's worth a trip if you're into the scene or are visiting Phoenix and want to experience the scene. This is definitely one of the Valley's landmark bars. If you're going alone and don't mind spending the evening by yourself (i.e. people-watching) it really isn't that bad. If you want to mingle with people, this bar isn't a great atmosphere for that. People generally go in cliques and you'll notice that the bar is full of clique-clusters. It definitely is not one of the friendlier bars in the Valley. It also seems to have an "instant snob" effect on people.   Now, for pluses... Amsterdam does have a beautiful outdoor area, which is suitable for smokers. You can not only take your drinks out there, but there is an outdoor bar at which you can get drinks. It's a nice area to have drinks in the spring, fall and early/late summer. Most of the summer it can still top 100 degrees even late at night and winter nights do get chilly. Amsterdam does have a nice interior as well. They also have an extensive, unique drink menu.  Amsterdam does have a different crowd earlier in the evening than it does late nights. If I were to focus solely on the evening atmosphere and if that were my only experience, I could honestly give Amsterdam more stars. The dense crowds aside, the "pretentious" environment and "go to be seen" atmosphere make it harder to enjoy. I've largely gone to bars based on the general environment and comfort, which is why it's harder for me to make Amsterdam a focus-point on a night out. If I'm in the area and feel like a drink, and it's early in the evening, I might be more inclined to stop in.

This is Phoenix' sacred mountain; a prestigious namesake for numerous surrounding areas and businesses. This is perhaps one of the greatest landmarks in the city and is, in a sense, a geological addition to the skyline. It's noticeable from the air upon arrival or departure into Sky Harbor, sitting north of the flight path. Whether or not you hike it, you will notice it as it is visible from most parts of the Valley. You may also notice it change colors throughout the day. It's a simultaneous "must-see" and "can't-help-but-see" attraction in Phoenix.

This is a beautiful, modern library. It lets in a lot of natural light for reading. It was built to reflect Arizona's geology (sun, canyon formations, etc.) and you will notice the "canyon walls" feel in the atrium. The outside resembles a mesa from the side. There is a large collection of books (though you will find a more scholarly/academic selection at Hayden Library at ASU Main) and plenty of space for reading. Floor-to-roof windows cover the north and south ends of the building and whether or not you wish to do any reading you will get great views of Downtown and Midtown Phoenix from the top floor.

This is a nice coffee shop in an area that is seemingly transforming (if not already) into Phoenix' gayborhood main commercial strip. The pastries are okay, but the drinks are really good. It's a bit quieter than corporate coffee chains and it's significantly more neighborly feeling. It is a converted, retro gas station, complete with a garage door. On nice days they open the door to let in fresh air and breezes.

You really can't go wrong with anything you order here. Food is cheap and the restaurant is near ASU. Unfortunately, many students have discovered it's quality and price, making it a bit crowded during the semesters. Lunch can be exceptionally busy. I'm a vegetarian and can't vouch for the meat dishes, but the couscous with red sauce is wonderful as are the other vegetarian options. If you can't decide, go with the vegetarian platter: baba ganoush (though it is a bit garlic-heavy) hummus, falafel, grape leaves, tahini and tabouleh, with pita on the side. There's a Middle Eastern shop next door with imported goods. The restaurant's easy to find, as it's just south of the mosque, which has the traditional dome and minarets.

This place looks nicer from the outside than it is. It's full of mainly low-end retail stores in the main building, as well as chain restaurants flanking it. For the frugal, this might be a treasure trove, as there are many outlets for cheap buys. It's hardly a destination and it's frequently a zoo. The strangest aspect of it is that it's just a stone's throw away from the 180 Biltmore Center. If you need clothes, you're on a tight budget and don't mind stores that are virtually torn apart from rabid shoppers, this is a destination. For tourists or people who want to enjoy a day out on Camelback Road, this is bypass shopping center.

My cousin was in Phoenix on business and we made dinner plans. He was up for Italian, so we went here. And it was yummy in the tummy. But a more detailed explanation...  For a Wednesday night, it was a tad busy. By a tad I mean there was a 20-minute wait. The waitress took our order, but the kitchen was slammed and it took awhile to get our food. I think that's just a testament to its popularity, plus we had some catching up to do so I wasn't in a hurry. Plus, they brought plenty of garlic bread and the attendant was so attentive he kept our water full. They had a decent wine list, but I couldn't have any due to an early interview the next morning. My cousin had a ravioli dish that looked really good, but I opted for the broccoli/garlic/basil/tomato stromboli, and I was happy with my decision. It was actually too big for me to finish, so I took home some leftovers. It had a good mix of flavor layers and blending. The dessert menu looked good too, but I was entirely too full to have any. The decor was cozy and romantic, and our waitress was very nice. The only downside was the interview the next morning, which meant I couldn't have a glass of wine. As I'm sure there will be one, there's always next time.

In one word: overrated. In many words...  It's a tourist trap. It's a plastic version of the Old West. It is one of the few places in the Valley in which you can go bar-hopping... but like anywhere else in this swollen suburb you still have to drive to get there. And on that note, don't bet on light rail service reaching this area anytime soon. The mayor argued a light rail line running through Old Town would ruin the look of the area. Forget the fact that two streets-- one to the east and one to the west-- branch off from Scottsdale Road, run alongside Old Town, then merge back to the main drag, they say it will spoil the look. I guess asphalt roads, traffic lights and a parking garage in the middle of the city were staples in late-19th Century Western towns though. But, I digress. It has amenities and street life Downtown Phoenix can't seem to attract, but most cater to tourists. Like pretty much everywhere else in the Valley, you'll be hard-pressed to find unique street life and quirky, bohemian elements of it. Scottsdale Fashion Square is nearby, as it wouldn't flourish anywhere else in the Valley without out-of-town money flowing in, thanks to an abundance of low-paying jobs in the Phoenix area.   A favorite haunt of 20K-millionaires and tourists, Old Town is a hilariously false representation of metro Phoenix. About as authentic to the Old West as Howdy Doody, if you're out for a pioneer-days pastiche you'll find it here.

I mentioned in a review of Southwest my outlook and understanding of the airline industry, which I will not repeat now. But to recap, there are generic problems with air travel, the airport process and the airline industry in general that is unfair to an airline to use as a standard, including lines, security, crowds, delays, etc.  As for US Airways, I can't say I have many complaints from the consumer perspective. For non-stop options out of Phoenix, your best bets are Southwest and US Airways, unless your destination is a hub of another airline, i.e. Dallas and Chicago for American; Denver, San Francisco, Washington and Chicago for United; Salt Lake City, Atlanta, JFK and Cincinnati on Delta, etc. With Phoenix as a hub for US Airways and Southwest (though the latter insists it's a "focus city") the former offers a large number of non-stop options from Sky Harbor.   The seats are about average for American carriers, they have rescinded charges for in-flight beverages and they are great about getting out on time. Last time I flew with them I went to San Francisco. The flight into Phoenix was running late, which would have put me in the City by the Bay an hour later than I was scheduled. Anyone who has tried to change an itinerary before knows that most airlines charge hefty penalties to do so. However, the check-in agent let me switch to Oakland at no charge, getting me in earlier than I expected.   Yes, US Airways has its downsides as well, but I must admit they're mostly on the back-end of things. It would be nice if they would expand international service out of Phoenix, giving us non-stop options into Europe, Asia, South America, maybe even Australia, as Phoenix is easily within a large aircraft's range of all three continents. From a local perspective, it's bad they instead focus more on their Eastern hubs of Charlotte and Philadelphia, as they will expand to Brazil and China within the next year, though only those two cities will benefit. From a civic standpoint, it could benefit the city and area to expand Phoenix' options, especially considering that many cities smaller than Phoenix offer more international destinations including Portland, Salt Lake City and Charlotte.   I'll admit Sky Harbor will be lacking for some time until this recession relents to a bull market... maybe. But in sum, US Airways' tickets are pretty reasonable, often cheaper than other carriers. Out of Sky Harbor, Southwest is its biggest competition and I would gladly pay a little more to fly US Airways domestically than I would Southwest.

This paper is awful and its internet version azcentral.com is even worse. I will glimpse through the web-version solely for the purpose of reading local news and might pick up a physical copy for the crossword. It does, however, defy two stereotypes associated with a major newspaper. Firstly, it seemingly has a policy against ground-breaking journalism and discourages its reporters from "getting the scoop." Secondly, that whole "liberal media" characteristic does not apply to this paper at all. Every election it endorses campaigning politicians, though almost always backs the conservative. Letters to the editor are largely conservative and are little more than toned-down hate speech. However, simply visit their website, which is available to the public with a thread format, and you will see the unbridled hate speech, borderline clinically-insane comments faithful readers leave, that this media outlet does not monitor.   Politics aside, the paper is full of spelling and grammatical errors, lags behind other Valley print media sources in content and could stand a massive restructuring from within, as in the business and policy side of this organization needs to be completely gutted and rebuilt properly.

The Valley's light rail caused a lot of controversy when it was voted into effect (by a landslide), while it was being constructed (with a movement to stop the light rail, even while streets were torn up to install it) and now that it's being used and beating expectations (being called a waste of money).  Truth be told, it's public transportation and like all forms of transportation it's just another option for getting around. If you want to spend a day around Central Phoenix you can purchase an all-day pass while saving gas. If you want to go to one place in particular and want to get there in a hurry, you may want to use a car. If you want to get to one place in particular and don't want to pay more money for parking and/or anticipate heavy traffic congestion afterward, the light rail is a great option.  No, it isn't a subway system, but one opposing argument to the rail is its expense. Given Phoenix' granite and caliche base, plus it's sprawl, a subway would've cost significantly more and would've taken significantly longer to build. Yes, it has limited access. A by-product of this age of instant gratification is impatience, and unfortunately, building the damn thing takes A LOT of time. We won't wake up and have an extensive system, ever. The line is exactly as Valley Metro calls it: a STARTER line. More lines are scheduled to be built and it will take time until other lines feed into it and give more of the Valley light rail access. Every city with rail transportation had to start with one line at one time or another.  Most complaints about the system are more or less people complaining just to complain. It's modern, comfortable, doesn't have that "rat in a tunnel" feel subways do, and gives people other options of getting around.

This is probably the most aptly named gay bar in Phoenix. Link "the Rock" to Alcatraz and voila, you have this nasty little place. I don't mean this in the prison sense, as you have the liberty to go (or leave) at your whim, but I mean it in the dirty/dank sense. Never have I been to a bar at which they ridicule regulars. Most bars would consider regulars to be familiar faces; loyal sources of income. However, I've heard staff use "alkie" spitefully in reference to regulars. This gross little hell hole is a must-skip spot in the Valley GLBT scene.

The City of Phoenix is overall run well, though as with any city comes with its glitches and negative aspects. As of now it is the nation's fifth largest city (and appears to be nestled in this statistical spot for some time to come) and the metro area ranks 12th... for now. It is likely to jump to 10th by the Arizona Centennial.   It is the largest city in the region at over 1.5 million residents and over 500 square miles. Founded in 1881 it's relatively young even by standards in the Americas. Outside of downtown, especially to the north, neighborhoods clearly transition in age and it is possible to watch decades go by as you move away from downtown. Phoenix is also the cultural and financial heart of the state, with multiple layers of government powers roosting here: city, county, state and federal.  On the bad side, City of Phoenix leaders tend to string major developments along, which leads to a lot of failed projects, i.e. the Trump Hotel, Metro Lofts, Copper Pointe and many, many more. Had civic leaders allowed for more projects to come to fruition, the city would have a much more Manhattanized appearance in its central core. The city is somewhat bad about historic preservation. Photos from Central Phoenix in 1940 present almost unrecognizable images. At the beginning of Hitchcock's "Psycho", you will see Central Phoenix circa 1960, and sadly, very few of those buildings remain. Regardless, the city has made an effort to NOT bulldoze  the old neighborhoods around downtown. However, many of the buildings seen in Central Phoenix were built during/after the mid-60s.   Regardless, some dedicated leaders have striven to catapult the city to its greatest potential and beyond. You can almost see it happening before your eyes, though urban progress is a slow feat. The city has had to compete with other prestigious Valley cities and at times has to work around State of Arizona and Maricopa Country legislation, which may hinder its progress, for example, in 2009 the state hurt bio-tech industries and "green" energy resources through crippling legislation, though Phoenix worked to maintain its existing bio-tech companies and land a new high-capacity solar plant.   In the end the city is more progressive than many of its suburban counterparts and offers plenty of amenities for locals. Many locals who have transplanted themselves here from elsewhere have not invested, do not invest and will not invest themselves in the city to explore and understand it further. As it works to become more established, more neighborhoods take on a demographic quality and niche, as black, Latino, gay, artistic, family, singles, blue, red, etc. neighborhoods have emerged into distinct parts of town.   Local or visitor, take some time out to immerse yourself in places outside your neck of the woods, explore, see what more Phoenix has to offer you never knew of before.  *Addendum: To clarify, my rating system on this is meant to reflect how I feel the city is run/operates.

As someone who has had working experience in the airline industry on the scheduling and pricing end, I feel I can't gripe about the usual boohoos everyone else has about the airline industry. To clear up a few things to express my point:   -Long lines: this is a part of going to the airport. Get over it or deal with the several-times-longer method of surface transit -Delays: this is another part of the airport experience. So what if it's sunny and gorgeous outside. Your flight began in Atlanta, where there are thunderstorms and tornadoes.  -Cranky people: air travel may not be as easy as you think. In the year 2009, the questions people still ask surprise me. *Fun Fact: Did you know an E-ticket is exactly that? An ELECTRONIC ticket. Yeah, you can book travel and go to the airport with nothing but your government-issued ID and you'll get a boarding pass. You REALLY don't need anything else. Little kinks in the grand system and little things happening in people's lives can make them a bit cranky -Uncomfortable seats: airplanes are metal tubes run by people who want to cram as many people in as possible in order to make a profit. This is a capitalist society and that's just part of it. Lower-quality seats are cheaper to purchase than plush velvet.  That and more make up the curse of air travel. Now, I will focus specifically on Southwest. They are a "closet hub-and-spoke" airline, as in they consider themselves point-to-point. I will admit that they do offer a fair selection of some point-to-point routes. However like all airlines they have hubs and focus cities, Phoenix being one of their hubs. This means that it is likely that if you live here, or visit here frequently, you will use it for a domestic flight. They are decent for Vegas or Southern California cities, but aren't a great option for many large cities east of Arizona, especially those with two or more commercial airports, as they typically service the most inconvenient ones for vacations, such as BWI, Dallas Love, Chicago Midway or MacArthur Islip on Long Island.   Their flight attendants remind me of preschool teachers and it seems they get end-of-the-year bonuses for acting like clowns. They're nice and friendly, but a bit overly perky and bubbly. The unassigned seating is a fiasco and this airline more than any other American carrier seems to be the de facto family carrier. I haven't been on any other carrier that attracts as many children, and I've been on a long list from American to Continental, from Cathay Pacific to Thai, from Asiana to AirFrance. Southwest  does offer competitive rates, but you will get what you pay for, including a flying day care and mystery seat. The whole A,B,C boarding process is ridiculous, as you really have no say in where you sit. For a weekend trip to Vegas or Southern California, from Phoenix, your options are US Airways, Southwest or United Express (LAX only) and in my opinion, unless Southwest offered an unbeatable deal, I would pay a little more to take either of the other two.  I could prattle on about specific experiences, though those could happen on any airline. In short, the structure and policies of Southwest are its weakest points. I will say that it isn't the worst airline I've ever been on (Aeroflot is the absolute worst and most likely will always be the absolute worst) but I would definitely look at other options, even choosing a layover on a different carrier though Southwest might offer a non-stop option. As I said before, I would fly it again, but only if the difference in fare between it and its competition was significantly lower.

I lived in Korea for two years and of course, did get sick a few times during that course. I was surprised to see a blend of Western and Eastern medical practitioners. My first inclination was to go with Western medicine. Why? Because it was what I was used to. Then that one time I was given Eastern medicine, I was hesitant, but took it anyway. I'm not sure how it works, but it does. After that, I'll gladly give Eastern medicine a shot and for some ailments, will actually choose it over chalky Western chemicals.  Now, I'm not sure if it was the change in weather, catching a cold or a sinus infection... but I recently had dizziness, weird pressure in my right ear, stuffiness and a bit of nausea. Rather than going to a one-on-every-corner CVS or Walgreen's we see in Phoenix, I went to Healthy Chinese Herbs. It's pretty easy to find: just go to the Chinese Cultural Center and it's between two restaurants near the corner on the east side. The smell in the store brought back memories. It doesn't have that stale smell most medical facilities have, but rather a sweet and savory scent. I told the lady behind the counter my symptoms, she thought for a minute and gave me Pe Min Kan Wan and Chinese Vitamin C. I took a dose after lunch, one after dinner, then went to bed... and woke up feeling clear, energetic and healthy.   I really recommend this place, even if it means stepping out of your comfort zone for medical treatment. I do believe I'll go back and stock up on stuff before the cold season really hits in full swing.

First, I must state that boom towns such as Phoenix never had the opportunity to gradually develop multiple facets common in all American cities as the population swelled over the years, and since the 1990s efforts to expand its dining scene, nightlife, business presence and more have begun sprouting new names across the Valley of the Sun. Regarding cultural amenities, Nearly Naked Theatre is a gem in a still-under-development city.   Nearly Naked is an excellent theater group which has been around for just over a decade. Though its name insinuates nudity on stage, most plays they perform are fully clothed. However, never say never, as some actors/actresses will be on stage fully nude. That being said, they don't alter the text of plays, don't censor and don't allow business sponsors to make any suggestions. They put on an excellent "Rocky Horror Show" last year, do an annual Christmas show entitled "Times Square Angel", a dark comedy "Killer Joe" and the final show of this 2008/2009 season "Blood Brothers." The actors really get into their roles and do a great job on stage. Every show I've seen runs smoothly without a malfunction, forgotten line or otherwise. They have a Wonderful 100 program which comes with added benefits. If your primary concern is finances, then the Wonderful 100 is not an economical option. However, if you enjoy going to the theater and wish to support this group (as I do) then it is a great option, as it is extra revenue for them to keep shows coming and ensure Phoenix has another option in its cultural life. In addition to preserving this troupe, Wonderful 100 members are given advance notice of upcoming shows and are given exclusive privileges the general audience is not. They have recently acquired a beer and wine license, and now serve light drinks before, during and after the show. If you are pleased with performances, cast and crew members meet outside for a "meet and greet" with the audience. The shows are predominantly at the Little Theater of the Phoenix Theater complex on the east wing of the Phoenix Art Museum and tickets are available through their website or by calling the Box Office at the museum. As of now, June 2009, the group is finalizing its cuttent season and will begin the next season in August. The 2009/2010 season offers "Rent", "Little Dog Laughed", "Phaedra", "Times Square Angel" and "Evil Dead: The Musical" amongst others.   On a personal note, I would love to see them put on "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" and the entirety of  "Angels in America" one season, though the latter is typically broken up into two running shows per season as it runs over seven hours. However, I cannot write any real complaints about the production, cast or any aspect of Nearly Naked, as I try to go for every show per season and always leave happy.

Papago Park is a great urban oasis nestled between Phoenix, Tempe and Scottsdale. It's a great way to discover the Sonoran xeriscape without leaving the Valley of the Sun. The enormous red rocks stand as a beautiful centerpiece of the park and offer great vantage points that provide you with beautiful 360-degree vistas of the city. Rock-climbing, hiking, mountain biking, picnicking and other activities make this one of the country's finest and most naturally beautiful parks.

This bar is pretty fun and more laid back than some others in the Valley. It's a little hard to find, tucked behind some restaurants in Park Central Mall. All in all it's a little small, but it's cozy. They have a nice shaded patio with ample seating, so smokers can take their drinks outside. They do serve free popcorn as so many others have noted. Personally, I think it's a great place to go for lazy day drinking on a Saturday afternoon. It's populated, but not packed during the day. All in all it's clean, light rail accessible, laid back and has nice decor. The drinks aren't overly priced and they offer entertainment on some nights.

It's an outdoor mall like the Biltmore, but nowhere near as upscale or charming. It likewise attracts a different customer-base, typically a college crowd, high school teenyboppers who can't wait to be the next sorority slut and families with unbridled children running amok. It's one of the newest additions to the shifting mall structure in the Valley, combining that consumerist cluster in the center encircled with an archipelago of boxy stores. The parking lot is a fiasco and confusing in some places. I can't say I really like most of the stores there and the ones I do like have chain stores nearer to my apartment than the Tempe Marketplace. On top of that, I can't stand children and one trip to this shopping spot will make you wonder how the eight-year-old kids of today will run this country in the future. Whining and throwing tantrums to get their way? They seem to have figured out that works on their parents. On the plus side it's clean and modern... and I can't really think of any other pluses.

This bar... well, it's location, epitomizes reincarnation. I first went here when it was Nasty Habits in the early 2000s... then it became TNT, then the Locker Room and now Ice Pics. It isn't a landmark like Amsterdam or Charlie's, but it does draw a crowd. It's cozy and intimate, though it is pretty dark inside. It's much more conducive to meeting people than those aforementioned bars. I have to really give them credit for allowing the philanthropic Grand Canyon Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence to do frequent fundraisers on bingo nights. The bingo nights change themes frequently. I like it for its comfort and relaxed atmosphere.

If you're new in town or just visiting, you'll probably hear of "Filly B's" and, unless you're oblivious or don't actually get out on the town, you're bound to see at least one... no, two... er, three... well, let's just say with Valley-wide locations and knock-off variations of this restaurant you're prone to encounter it. Pretty much every Valley resident is familiar enough with this local chain that speaking its name conjures familiarity, it can be part of a joke locals understand and is a guilty pleasure for people with even the most refined tastes. It's more expensive than Taco Bell, but the quality and portions are bigger. Watch out after last call as the drive-through lines tend to back up. Most locations are open 24 hours and it's a great place to stop for cheap eats: more than likely there's one on the way home.

I absolutely HATE that I can say this... but, I remember the days when Mill Avenue had a different feel to it. There used to be fewer chains and the vibe was much more bohemian, making it more or less the only part of the Valley with any personality. Several years later, visitors to Mill Avenue really just go to a simulacrum; a soulless husk of an Old West-ish main drag. Don't be fooled by the "historical buildings" on the street, as a number of them are over a century old, but quite a few were built architecturally designed to look old. I can appreciate the aesthetic value of it, just as I can appreciate the attempt to make a walkable neighborhood. Unfortunately, only this synecdoche of Tempe is walkable: the majority of visitors have to drive to get here (not good for a bar-hopping/drinking-and-driving destination) and the lack of amenities would still make it difficult to live and work here without a car, unless they shop for groceries at the corner CVS. Its proximity to ASU is likely to keep it a popular destination, as is Downtown Phoenix' laziness and willingness to let Tempe take prominent events (i.e. Oktoberfest, New Year's Eve,) but all in all it's worth avoiding.

Phoenix Pride has swollen in size and gets bigger every year. I first went in 2002, and most recently went in 2009. Typically most cities host Pride in June, though for obvious reasons Phoenix rings in the Pride season in early April. The selection in vendors and dining, and the volume of people attending grows every year. I got to Pride over an hour late (from the parade start time) and got to 3rd Street to see a significant number of floats still on the parade route, meaning the opening parade is over an hour long. One downside is the entrance line. I would recommend purchasing tickets in advance, as you will avoid waiting behind all the other procrastinators to buy tickets, and waiting again to get into the main festival. The whole event used to be only on a Saturday, but has since expanded to the whole weekend. A good majority of Steele Indian Park is filled with party-goers. I look forward to seeing it grow and develop more in the future, as Phoenix' gay population, who like most everyone else here is a transplant from elsewhere, forms stronger bonds and a stronger sense of "community," helping the city to coalesce into shared living space and culture.

I do enjoy this coffee shop, though admittedly it has largely subscribed to bohemian bloodletting since emerging from the former Willo House. They still present photographs, paintings, sculptures and more throughout the cafe, most, if not all, for sale. The clientele has changed, as has the interior. Regardless, it's still a nice place for coffee. For those who haven't been, it's set in an old house on the southeast corner of 3rd Avenue and McDowell. Personally, one of my favorite activities is to start here for coffee and take a walking tour in the area. It's one of the few neighborhoods in Phoenix with historic homes from the 1920s, which seem to be untouched by the authoritarian overlords of homeowner's associations so popular in suburbs. I could be wrong, as I don't live in the area. But, to stay on topic, the menu is a bit pricey but Hob Nob's has retained the Willo House's cozy, neighborly feel, though yes, over a few short years it transitioned from hippie to yuppie.

I left Phoenix for Oklahoma City in 2011 because of the economic crisis, and returned to visit in November of 2014. Before going, I knew I was going to have to make time for the Apache Trail. In Oklahoma I'd been so used to the sweeping vistas of... horizon. So yeah, I needed to escape from civilization and engage in something profound, philosophical and spiritual. There's something about the elegant mix of a winding, rough road weaving around hills and mountains amidst steep valleys and desert forest that really sticks to your soul. I usually feel I'm one to rush through life, but this place is quite humbling to me, hearing nothing but Sonoran winds and seeing a different scene at every bend; it stops me from being somewhere and makes me just be. The drive can be a bit tense in parts, but it's otherwise a majestic example of the pageantry of nature, and is well worth the time and low speed limits. There are few places I've been that I find utterly serene, but this is one of them, and there are fortunately plenty of spots to pull over to take in the view and take your time to enjoy this experience.

People seem to have fallen in love with this controversial park. It's another addition to downtown, as Phoenix works to improve the central city and revitalize the area. The most prominent feature is the massive sculpture that hangs over the park. Supposedly a "cactus flower" I've heard it likened to everything from jellyfish to tornado to vagina. It's interesting to see in the day, albeit a bit of an eyesore, but the park's real potential comes out at night when the LED pillars and sculpture are lit. Darkness hides the support system and the sculpture appears to float over the city. You will notice the various colors on it by day, but the night lights make them glow and contrast each other. It is definitely a unique addition to downtown Phoenix.

If anything, this is a fun place to look around. It's like looking through your drag mother's attic. Boom Boom La Rue's is situated in its own pavillion in the Antiques Marketplace. It isn't a drag superstore; it's just a small little annex in the main building. They have a lot of women's clothes that are obviously not for women and gaudy accessories are plentiful. The clothes are really just hyperbolic interpretations of what women wear. One can find a vast selection of shoes, women's sizes 10 and up. As one who does drag only for Halloween, I must say this cozy little place offers larger shoes I need (size 12 in women's) and offers also a fun little stop if I'm in the building.

I enjoy this "Phoenix Pride 2" annual event. It doesn't cover as much space and isn't quite as grand as Pride in April does. However, that's the point of this venue. It is designed to be a toned-down version of Phoenix Pride, doesn't have a parade and has more of a Main Street USA feeling. It's a street fair that fills Heritage Square the first weekend of October, making it a second injection of gay events after the summer heat passes. Pride takes place at Steele Indian Park and has more of a sequestered feeling, but the Rainbows Festival has a more street-fair-feeling as it is surrounded by Downtown Phoenix rather than grassy knolls and plains. It feels more inviting as there are entrances to the fair on multiple sides. Because it's in a part of Downtown Phoenix in which historic relics survived demolition, it has more of a small town atmosphere, which relays more of a community feeling amongst queer folk than anonymity and parties. This allows the Rainbows Festival to convey a consensual feeling of commonality and unity, providing people with a shared culture and civic space. Go to the fair expecting it to be more intimate, but do not go with the mindset that it will be at Pride's scale.

Before I begin, I confess that I haven't lived in New York or California as some of the other writers have, thus am not used to the variety of Korean food in those cities. I did, however, live in Seoul and Incheon for quite awhile, so alas that's the closest I can come to gauging how authentic Korean food is. And as I ate Korean food almost daily for a few years, based on my limited experience, I have to say that Red Kimchi is very good.  First, the staff was very nice and attentive, and they were quick about service. I kind of wish I went with more people because there was too much food for me to eat, and they have tteokbokki as an appetizer, which I wanted to order but wasn't hungry enough to eat in addition to my main meal. The bibimbap was delicious and they brought a big bottle of Korean ketchup (or chili sauce) so I could glop on as much as I wanted. I was tempted to get dolsot bibimbap instead, but that will be for next time. Anyway, they put in a generous amount of vegetables and brought six dishes of banchan. I ate as much as I could, but filled up fast. I regret having such a late lunch in retrospect.   Most Korean restaurants in the Valley seem to be in remote areas, and I didn't really want to deal with a 30-minute drive to get to one. The convenience of this place drew me in, and everything else about it will draw me back.

This location opened up not too long ago and after a few months of procrastination I finally went. I love wine- well, a lot of it anyway- so I knew I was going to love it. It didn't disappoint either. They have sections sorted by variety and geography. The usual wine-growing regions are represented here: Napa Valley, France, Spain, Italy, Chile... and unfortunately Australia (horrendous wine in my opinion.) They even have selections from more unorthodox, less traditional regions. Seeing a Southwest section, I picked up a bottle of Kokopelli Cabernet Sauvignon, which was surprisingly tasty.   Total Wine specializes in wine, but they have an impressive section of beers and spirits as well, plus an annex for cigars. I went too late to attend the wine tasting, which ended at five. Then again, I don't believe I'd fancy joining a group of people to swish wine and spit it out in a bucket. They have a classroom for wine classes, though I only saw desks, chairs, a whiteboard and maps of traditional wine-growing regions on the wall. Tuition is $25 for one class, $100 for five.   The only thing I wish they had was a cremerie/fromagerie, with more upscale cheeses. All in all, I really enjoyed the trip and intend to go back.

This was the last place I lived in Phoenix. And by last I mean both "most recent" and also "final." I finally made it out and will never live in that sweaty armpit, dead-end town again. However, if you're one of the sun junkies who only needs to see that big ball glowing in the sky to be happy in life, and therefore like calling Phoenix home, I would recommend these apartments. There are two main buildings: townhouses on the west end and apartments on the east. The apartments have underground parking, which helps to not step into nauseating heat in your car, and the townhouses have garages. The complex has a lot of amenities, including courtyards, grills, a pool and jacuzzi, elevators, a gym, a pet run, a community room and a meeting room. I thought the people in the front office were a pleasure to deal with when I needed to discuss something. A huge plus was the noise: my downstairs neighbor had a party one night, which I could only hear because I went out onto my balcony, and my next door neighbor had his TV up loud, which I could only hear in the hall. I was amazed at how well the walls block out sound. It's in a convenient location to Downtown- Phoenix, -Tempe and -Scottsdale, and it's also near Sky Harbor and Loop 202. There's a light rail station that doesn't seem too far away until you actually walk it. Arizona loves that Soviet-style city planning, so if you wish to walk to the station you'll need to trek across great parking lots (i.e. open paved spaces) and a wide road and it will take about 20 minutes. Some downsides: unassigned parking is a bitch and fills up extremely fast, apartments on the southwest corner get way too much sun and will make your electric bill in the hot season (as opposed to Phoenix' only other, and much shorter season: warm) pretty high even if you try to conserve power.

After being banished 3 1/2 years ago to Oklahoma, I made a return trip to Phoenix recently and had to go here. As you can imagine, the Southwestern/Mexican food anywhere in Oklahoma is... how do I put it? Best not eaten. So I gorged myself on Mexican while in town. I stopped in at Los Dos Molinos for lunch and the atmosphere alone made me feel more comfortable. They brought me the staple tortilla chips and salsa. I don't know that I can actually call it salsa though... it was more like an art: a palatable aesthetic. I had a problem here, in that I had so many restaurants to hit up while in town and only so much room in my stomach. Sadly, that meant I needed something to satiate my appetite and craving, so I opted for a simple bean burrito. It had a good blend of seasoning, plus a nice mix of refried and whole pinto beans. I ended up using all the salsa by dousing my burrito with it. The only downside to the place is the tight parking behind the restaurant, but all in all it was a great experience.

As I write this review, my eyes keep shifting to the pictures of the food and I'm tempted to go to Gojo right now. I noticed several newer Ethiopian restaurants have somewhat recently opened and I want to work my way through them all. This one is really good. If psychedelic has a flavor, this is it. The sample platters let you work your way through different combinations of layers of taste and textures, and the seasoning is robust and all around perfect. I went for the 7-veggie option because I wanted to sample everything. Looking back... I'd order the same thing again. I was too indecisive with what I had to narrow it down to larger portions of 4 items.  Portions are massive, so you have to bring your appetite. Even then, I had to take home leftovers because it was too much food for me to eat. I tried though, I just don't have enough room in my stomach to finish it in one sitting. The bonus to that is that I can have it again for lunch the next day.

Going to get my complaint out of the way early: this place needs to open new locations. It's in North Phoenix, and unfortunately that isn't the most convenient place for me. Fortunately I had an errand near-ish to it, so I made it a point to go here.  The prices are very reasonable. At least for the consumer. The quality exceeded what I paid for it. I was a little worried it was going to be small, but it was pretty much a foot-long banh mi. The combination/ratio of all the ingredients was absolutely perfect, and the flavor was so good I wanted to get another. By another, I mean something like a 10-foot banh mi for an office party.   The bread was excellent, but I love Vietnamese bread. It's extra crisp on the outside, and airy-soft in the middle. The flavors are layered, so you get an explosive burst in your mouth, yet it all comes together harmoniously. I really wanted to try something from the shaved ice menu, but that will be for next time. I think I'm going to have to come up with an excuse to go to North Phoenix again. And soon.
