I have been going here for years to see Rob. When I first showed up as a referral, my hair was stick-like and dry, as a result of years of bad bleach jobs. I had a line across the back of my head from my last bleach job! Rob was, to say the least, amazing. He worked with me and within a few short weeks my hair was shiny and soft and gorgeous. Since then I've gone blonde to dark brown to bright red, and Rob always hits the mark. He is great at knowing the right colors and the right cuts to flatter, and is always professional. I highly recommend him to everyone!

One word: amazing.  Was here for restaurant week, started with the Gazpacho, then had the Scallops, and finished it off with the bread pudding.   Great cocktails, amazing service, and outstanding food. They are awesome.

I've been here twice - the first time, almost all of the local brews on tap were out. I tried to order more than 4 local brews, and they were completely tapped out. They only had the worst beers available.   The second time I was there, I wanted to eat. They said that they were a "tapas restaurant" and only had small offerings. I got their baked shrimp for $12, and it was disgusting and small. I also ordered a diet coke, and it was completely flat when I got it. It was incredibly frustrating, and the service was terrible. I love City Scape, but if you're in the mood for a great place with good beers and drinks, either go to Tilted Kilt or Arrogant Butcher...this place won't last.

Go to any other Native. This one is TERRIBLE!  The girls on the phone are beyond rude. I spent 5 minutes explaining to one of them that balsamic dressing comes on the wedge salad and I didn't want any on mine. She still didnt get it. That was right before she hung up on me without giving me a pick up time.   Oh and when you do get a time? Buyer beware. If they tell you 25 min, it's more like 40. They won't toss your wings in sauce until you get there, and even when you do get there you're in line behind all the dine in and other take out customers. Even if you tell them to toss it beforehand, they don't. The manager will give you a $5 off coupon if you complain about the wait, but why do that when its so bad in the first place?  And let's talk about how the waitresses are all friends and hang out. If you dine in? Good luck on getting food within 40-45 min and forget drink refills. Hope you ordered the biggest beer and only wanted one. They're too busy with their friends to do their job.  Skip it - there's a great location off of Estrella Parkway not too far away where the waitresses aren't there to hang out with their friends, the food comes out like it should, and they're friendly.
