This a great little italian place. The decor is stylish and the ambience is romantic. The food is excellent and house chianti is very tasty and reasonably priced.

Worst bbq i have ever eaten. Dry cheap meat. Overcooked veggies and pinto beans with a splash of bbq sauce. Total hood bbq! H O R R I B L E!!!

Very relaxed atmosphere.  Music is low and perfect for table conversations. Great wine and food selections. Prices are reasonable but not cheap. Happy hour is perfect on the patio.
