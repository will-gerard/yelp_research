I recently went here since I always past by it everyday. Well I was glad that I did. I was greeted with a huge smile as I walked in the door. I went in the morning and surprisingly it was not packed. I sat at the counter and was again greeted by this time my waitress. Breakfast was outstanding and service was great. I defiantly will be back.

Really wasn't to sure about this place when I first heard of it, however I gave it a try. This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant. Very big space for large groups, big screen on the wall with sports playing. Now lets get to the food, it's a mixture of Asian an Mexican. I always end up getting the same thing jade chicken black beans an jerk chicken rice. Maybe one day I will venture out an try other things, then again maybe not.

3 strikes ur out Joe. Took some shirts here to get cleaned an still didnt get them  cleaned right .. This is the 3rd time that ive had to speak with the owner about the service here. The first time I took a coat to be cleaned they tell me it will be done after 5 the same day only to be handed a soggy coat that wasn't done. Joe called an had me bring it back to be done over. Next problem was with a worker in the store just overlooking me after waiting 30 mins to get service. Called up Joe again an he said that he would get on the person an gave me credit to come back an try them again. So that's what i did. I brought in 4 shirts one had a juice stain on it so i told the employee to make sure that it was treated before cleaned. Man i get the stirt back not only is the stain still there but its still dirty only thing that was done was it was pressed. At this point I'm pissed so again call Joe he tells me to bring it up an he would take care of it himself. So back to the store i go only to have him tell me i wont get it back today but sometime later this week .. uhhh wtf ??? Then this a hole says this is a nice shirt what do you do for a living . I replied who cares I don't clean shirts an if i did they would be done right .. man that place is a real piece of work .  I will never go there again FUCK JOE AN HIS CREDITS

Pretty nice place, just over this past weekend. The units are nicely furnished, full sized appliances and a huuuuuge tub in the bathroom. I brought along our Xbox for downtime while waiting to get your party on in Vegas. iPod docking station helps you with that also. Nice balcony fits about 6 comfortably which is fine for smoke breaks.  But what you really can't beat is how close you are to the strip. An if u need it there are shuttles that can take you to the strip. We just walked an smoked swishers which was fine with me. Defiantly will be staying here again

Pretty laid back chill spot. Ipads an video games for customers in a lounge area overlooking a view of a litte lake. But i forgot to talk about the best part, the yogurt. Soooo many flavors and twice as many toppings. I went with the strawberry mixed with red velvet an new york cheesecake. Toss on some fresh strawberries an kiwi. Toss on some walnuts an almonds an your good to go. I'll definitely be back.

This was my 2nd time coming back here  so i wanted to see what some other wings tasted like from here. I went with the Cajun hot an sweet potato fries. These were on point competing with long wongs which is right down the street.

Temporary fix for a Midwest staple. I've been here in Arizona for a little over 5 years . Moving from Detroit I stayed eating at a Coney Island at least one meal of the day. So when I heard of the Detroit coney grill I was very excited, an to find out that they were getting their chilli from one of the best if not oldest coneys in Detroit, made it Mir appealing. When I told my wife that there was a coney in the valley we decided to check it out. When we made if to the location I knew I was in the right place. Several people leaving the place with their Detroit tigers fitted I felt at home for a quick second. The vibe inside was nice, some photos on the wall of certain Michigan team an a few other things Detroit. So now we get to the food which is really the reason that we came. Unlike most of the other people who have given reviews I was somewhat unimpressed by the menu as well as pricing an hours. Understand this, I am Detroit in every way shape an form. I've said on many occasions that if there were a coney out here that was exactly how we have them back home you would have a winner. Although the food is nice here, it's menu is missing so much that would make this a great place to go. I don't want to just go to a spot because its reminds me somewhat of home. And I think that this is what's happening with this place. So many people from Michigan have moved out here to the valley that anytime that you hear of anything from home you want to check it out. Coneys are a 24/7 grill with sooooo much to choose from on the menu you sometimes stand at the counter trying hard to make a decision on what to get. Burgers an coney fries are nice however just a scratch of the surface. And 2 bucks for a faygo is highway robbery, especially when you can go to certain qts or circle k's an get a 20 oz for 1 buck. The guy told us that they charge that much because it cost so much to send them out here. I know some may see this as a raggin rant, however it's not. In order to stand the test of time with a business you have to look at everything your patrons are saying an try to make adjustments. If not that same thing can turn around and bite you. Hopefully this is just a start to a great establishment in the valley. I'll be back to see if anything has changed. #whatupdoe
