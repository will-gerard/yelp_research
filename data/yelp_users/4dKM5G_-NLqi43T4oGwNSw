I have been going to Atmosphere for many years. I originally went to the salon at their old location at Thomas and followed them to their gorgeous upgraded location near Camelback. Everyone is so friendly, nice and beautiful in the salon. Afton is my hair stylist and I trust her completely with my hair. I always take her direction when it comes to a new cut or style. She is great, friendly, and I always love me hair when I leave.  I also love the nail services in the salon. Vera will make you feel like a million bucks and you will leave with perfect perfect perfect nails. She also has available quick dry nail polish which is vegan and free of scary chemicals. The polish dries super fast and I have no chips for two weeks. I love this place and would highly recommend it to anyone!

Terrible dining experience. It took almost three hours to get our food and it came out cold and coagulated. First the appetizer was very late "because it was burned" and needed to be remade. We watched numerous tables come and go, with our food never arriving. It was so hot upstairs, we sweat through our clothes. Nothing was done to cool the section off.  When the manager arrived, they tried to make things right, but the screwed up remaking our order, gave us the wrong to go dessert, and two people in our group went home with some other table's half eaten left overs! Disgusting.   I used to think highly of Maggianos, but their service and quality have fallen apart. Never going back.

Just finished breakfast here. There are 4 customers here and our food took over 30 minutes to arrive. My order was wrong, they put the wrong veggies in my omelette. Hash browns are dry, generally uninspired breakfast. Save your money and eat at home.

I try to attend Skullpt two to three times a week. I have yet to wake up the morning after a class an not be sore head to toe! They really work you out and I saw results very quickly. Not to mention, this is the best I have felt in my life. I have done several yoga classes as well, and as a beginner, I have learned a lot and have very much enjoyed every class. I really like the instructors and staff at Sutra. I feel comfortable working at my own pace, but feel motivated to push myself every time I am there and try something new. The studio is a great space, the raw juice bar is fantastic. I really can't say enough good things. It is worth every penny because I am improving my health and confidence day by day.

Rev. Amy performed an offsite wedding for us and it turned out beautifully. I think people forget the most important part of the wedding is really the ceremony and those words that are exchanged between the bride and groom. It was the most memorable part of the day for us. Rev. Amy was wonderful and flexible with the unique needs of our ceremony. It was perfect and everything we could hope for. Thank you Rev. Amy!!

Had dinner on 7/19. We were promptly greeted and sat at a long bar table inside. I really liked the atmosphere, very clean and modern, but still warm with the wooden tables. We ordered the specialty brat by Chef Beckett with pickled onions as well as the kosher brat with kraut. All of their ingredients are homemade I as I was informed by our waitress. I really liked the Dijon mustard and thought the kraut was fresh, not too salty. We also ordered fries with dipping sauces. I assume the fries are twice fried, so if you like them crunchy, order them up. The truffle aioli and bleu cheese bacon dipping sauces were best. Sriracha dipping sauce is a good concept, but wasn't particularly flavorful.   The beer selection is great! Green Flash Palate Wrecker was priced very well, as was the Rasputin we ordered. A nice selection of a variety of beers, which I thought were fairly priced. (Sorry to Bud and Coors fans, get your cheap beer-water fix elsewhere).

Just had great food, great beer and excellent service from Nathan. The milk shakes were delicious and well priced at $4. We enjoyed a burger salad and recommend the bison burger. Also had the split fries and onion straws, also good.
