Dr Gibb is fantastic! He is a knowledgeable, gentle, and caring doctor.  I would recommend him and the clinic to anyone.

This location rocks! The staff is friendly and happy to be at work.  I have probably eaten at 45 times and have never had a bad experience. The food is great as is the value!

Thus is a very cool little pharmacy! The staff is knowledgable, friendly and professional. They stock a lot of specialty medications and the pharmacist is the owner.

I had sushi and a couple of drinks here last night, Valentine's Day and the ladies working behind the bar were amazing. Fast friendly service.

I recently visited this HI Health store as I was looking for meal replacement shakes and some vitamins. The gal that was working seemed to be knowledgeable and was very nice.

The restaurant has a nice upscale atmosphere.  We are at the bar, sampled the Moscow Mule and Martini's. I would recommend the Hot and Messy along with the I love shrimp. The Dynamite is pretty good too.

The quality of service and car wash has become absolutely horrible at this location. Plus they have the highest gas prices in the area.

This is my first my time eating here Zookz. An Interesting and tasty twist to the typical sandwich. The potato salad was tasty too.

Excellent enchiladas!  The place is a bit noisy but the food is good. A unique concept.

I have sat at the bar hear numerous times and have gotten great service. Twice I have been seated at arable and have had terrible service and once told I needed to have at least three in my party to sit at a table. The same man and women have provided poor service and were unprofessional both times.

The Guild has a very cool vibe. I started lunch with a big bowl of chips and an assortment of four different salsas. Awesome! My duck and snapper tacos were also delicious. You have got to try their Guacamole!

My mom and I had dinner here last night. We came into the restaurant and then remembered that the sweet 16 playoffs were on tv so we weren't sure about even getting a table as the place was packed.  We were seated in 5 minutes. Sadie (sp) our waitress came by to get us drinks very quickly. Sadie was awesome!!! She was knowledgable, helpful, very attentive and friendly. The employees all seemed to work really well together which made things work well.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and my mom had the Rueben, both with sweet potato fry's. Both sandwiches were awesome. Great food and great service!
