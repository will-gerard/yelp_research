Manager told me he was "Seeing a pattern" in my ordering pizzas because they have forgotten cheese sauce when delivering pizzas. Once because I ordered a thin crust and they don't sent sauces with thin crust and again when I ordered pizza for myself and three others and they heard me ask for one garlic sauce and two cheese sauces.  I worked for papa johns. This is the GENERAL MANAGER talking me a former employee and customer like this! Never ordering from this store again. I will drive to Val Vista and elliot to pick up my pizzas. I highly suggest others do the same.

Great food. Terrible service. Waited over 30 minutes for our food. People that came in after us got their food before us and when we called the manager he never even called us back about our experience. I love firehouse. NOT this location.

This company ruined hundreds of dollars of my girlfriends clothes and the owner refused to reimburse her the lost money. Shame on him. The clothes were clearly damaged by them. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. They have 4 locations don't risk your clothes getting damaged.
