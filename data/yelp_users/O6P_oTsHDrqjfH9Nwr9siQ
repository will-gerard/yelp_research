I moved to the valley a few years back and I looked up seafood online.  Well it took me about 2 years to get here, but it was well worth the trip.  I now make excuses to get near this place.  I have been more than a half dozen times with different people and we always leave satisfied.  I probably shouldn't give them 5 stars as I don't want the parking lot to be completely full when I get there.

I am currently waiting on 1 cabinet.  Everything was a go until we paid.  After that it went downhill.  The Greencraft rep, Korah has fumbled a few times. She is less than professional.  The first day their phone systems did not work so so I wasted an hour and a half trying to contact her.  From there it typically takes 2+ days to respond to an email.  And she actually called laughing after 4 pm on a Friday to tell us our appt would be cancelled on Monday, the 7am appt. This was sprung on us after no contact for about a week.  Had already taken the day off so it was a day wasted. Oh, and the installers DID show up at my home because she did not alert them.    The re-order should have taken place on the 14th after the inspection.  But that did not occur until the 16th. Supposedly it was a rush, BUT I was alerted that the one, STOCK item, not special order would be ready the 9th of October...That is almost 4 weeks when I was told 1-2 weeks. We started the process August 16th.  So IF they are able get the cabinets on the 9th of Oct we still have at least 2.5 weeks to wait for install.  Acceptable???     We needed the cabinets in prior to the 3rd of October due to our own needs and restrictions.  We had explained this to everyone involved.... my wife is pregnant so we cannot make install dates within say a 1-2 week window around the due date.   If you are debating a purchase...think it through.  If something bad can happen... IT WILL!!     I am currently checking on the cancellation process.  Buyer beware!!!    I would like to add, the managers Dawn and Mary have been helpful, but their hands are tied as we are all waiting on a 3rd party.

This is a cozy little place in a strip that you would not notice unless someone told you to meet them there.  I am lucky as I happen to live around the corner.  Great service and food.  The chef or cook or manager is very attentive.    I guess I am not sure as he has the chef's hat on and also comes around to make sure everyone enjoys their food. And the rest of the staff is very nice.  The rosemary potatoes are nice change to basic hashbrowns (of which I am always a fan).  Oh and you can get lattes and caps, as well as, regular coffee and tea.  I recommned it.  And during the week there is never a wait.

Not a fan!!  I just left there for lunch.  I had read a comment about them not having an identity (Ryan J.).  I agree they are going in different directions.  I tried the brisket.  Eh!  I am a smoker of meats and a bit of a traditionalist, so I thought it was odd to have it served to me in a pot of juice and water.  Was this really smoked or slow cooked?  It did not have smokey flavor I was craving.  AND for a  "smoke house," I smelled no smoke...that should have been the only sign I needed.

Good concept....poor performance. I love me some BBQ....especially while waiting for my car.  However theirs was dry.  I was excited to try the pulled pork omelet with mozzarella.   People must be deprived of good bbq in NorSco because this was weak.  Now I will try again because I have to have some brisket.  But never again with the pork or eggs.  BOO.

Good Food...Terrible Service.  I wish I had something witty to say.  However, I have been here several times and only once did I get food in a timely fashion.  I have waited in line for a smoothie/shake/drink long enough that people who ordered after me got their food and ate it.  Today I called and got their answering machine not once but 3 times after 9 am.  I believe they open at 7.  I then called back and was put on hold for more than 5 minutes.  I have never waited that long on the phone before unless it was for a mortgage or the IRS....still waiting on my liver cleanse....

I am a smoked meat aficionado. I was very happy with my brisket so my wife and I went again. The 2nd time my meat was very fatty, much to my surprise.  HOWEVER, our waitress took back my plate and brought me a whole new meal.  I was VERY happy with the service and the food.  ONE SUGGESTION, make peach cobbler without blueberries.... please.  If you have a chance try the apple pie moonshine too.  You will not be disappointed.
