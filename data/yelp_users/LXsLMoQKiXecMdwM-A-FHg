I love this place, it is a bit gritty but wonderful. I am not Asian but lived with first generation Chinese for many years. This is how we ate at home. I order off the menu items all the time. They are very accommodating. This is not fancy and if your looking for great service this is not it.  It is however a great place to eat and enjoy a great meal. It reminds me of being at a family's house. It is warm and full of life. I have eaten everything here and do recommend all the food, try something new.

This is one of the most frustrating and inept (using the same term as the previous review) title companies I have ever had the displeasure to work with. Yes they are nice but I wish I had read the reviews before. I would never had made the assumptions that they would read the contract (their escrow instructions) or work to close the transaction in a timely manner. 2 days to produce a preliminary HUD is just crazy and poor business. I am shocked that this is the title company that Fannie Mae would want to handle their transactions. I will be writing to Fannie Mae and their representatives as well. Just a bad experience. I hope you read these reviews before you begin the process instead of when you can not get a return call or email and your closing is already late.
