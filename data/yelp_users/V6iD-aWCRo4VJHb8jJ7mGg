Had used them in the past, they were fine.Then I dealt with John I ask for templates made for 2 tops on computer tables  in my den made of smoked glass.  John said they were going to be ready. My Husband went down to get them, and they had some excuse no glass tops.  Weeks and weeks went by so many excuses they were't ready.Turned into almost 2 months, they never made them. Left message for owner, never heard from him. Great way to run a business. They did me a favor, had  Glass Splash make me gorgeous perfect tops.

Just came from there, Owner's son had a  attitude with me, just having fun , I'm from Boston. Ordered a salad with Calamari , little extra marina. They don't allow it. No nobody  in Italy would let you have extra   Maraina  sauce bullshit! We're Italian American's belong to the Italian American Club, & we go to Italy & Sicily every year! First time & last! Calamari was so salty! Give me a break!

This is the 2nd time I used Glick's Mobile service. What a sharp guy Dave is. A real professional, very courtesy. Did a fabulous job showing me how not to mess up my new I Mac computer, that he did remotely.Then my wireless printer was messed up and he came over, Dave really knows his stuff! Also went above and beyond showing me how to navigate my new I Mac. Very reasonable pricing. Thanx again Dave!

I was recommended to go to Hayla over 2/12 months ago. I had two pillows a lg one and a king pillow for my dogs, plus a ramp I built for the doggies. A cushion for my desk and also a cover for the back of my computer chair, and the seat. I kept nagging her when is it going to be done? If she couldn't do it, she should of told me she is too busy. then Hayla told me that  week the stuff was going to be done she only excepts cash, never said a word. then Hayla tells me I owe her 375.00!!! I told her she was nuts. I gave her 300.00. I got home everything was baggy. the computer chair seat was too small and the back had darts in it and didn't fit right.  The original pattern didn't have darts. I have to  buy different material and have it made all over again.I brought her the material, the lining and the patterns. What a nightmare!!!!!                                                                                     Barbra Gradozzi

I went to Hayla 2/12 months ago i was recommended by a friend. If i had known now what a nightmare it was going to be I wouldn't of gone. It took her 2 1/2 months to do a big pillow for my dogs, a king pillow and a ramp I designed. Also a sm desk cushion. And a computer chair back and seat. Finally last week everything was done. Then she informed me she just takes cash! Then i got sticker shock 375.00. I told her Im giving you 300.00. I brought the stuff home 5 pieces were baggy and  the back of the computer chair had darts in it. Horrible! My pattern didn't have that in it. I have to find new material and start all over. I gave her all the material, lining & patterns, what a nightmare.                                 Barbra Gradozzi

I had the distinct pleasure of meeting Irina of Golden Thread Alterations, boy do I love her!  Irina can sew anything! Not only tailoring but making patterns for me for all my projects in the house. Irina never says no to anything! Can't thank you enough.                                                                                            Barbra Gradozzi

Since our remodel 8 years ago  I have had to pay a fortune, deal with incompetent home theater companies. Yesterday I got to meet Justin owner of Wright AV, right away I knew I was in good hands. Justin was very thorough,  professional, and  went above and beyond to do a superb job getting all my equipment to work properly. He prices for services render were so fabulous!!!! I couldn't believe it. I'm using him again next week, and I've been on the phone to all my friends to use Wright AV, they won't be disappointed.    Thank you Justin                                                            Barbra Gradozzi
