I read the reviews and decided to take a chance. Unfortunately the not so favorable reviews were the correct ones! The guy who did my mani/pedi...seemed bothered to be doing the work. Added cost which was never vocalized. And the front desk lady...I assume the owner...didn't seem to care that I was upset to pay $45 for mani/pedi!! NOT happy at all and will NEVER go back!!

Fastest Urgent Care I have ever been to. Checked in online and only 3 people there. I will go here again!
