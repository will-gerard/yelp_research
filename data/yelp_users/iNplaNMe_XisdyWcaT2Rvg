Having grown up in Hawaii, I have been around the freshest of the freshest seafood and am very picky when it comes to good sushi.  Having the freshest seafood is what makes great sushi and the Ritz Carlton's Bistro 24 has it.  I have tried other so called sushi places around Phoenix with terrible results.  However, on the bright side, I am thinking that maybe the Ritz isn't the only place that gets dibs on the freshest fish.  I am sure the Phoenician does, as well as all of the other top tier Resorts.  Then it gets trickled down to all of the other establishments in the Valley from highest to lowest...catch my drift?  Just a reminder, if you see a sushi place where there are Asians preparing it, jump on it.  I don't mean to put race into the mix by any means, nor do I think only Asians can create good sushi (the chef at the Ritz was Caucasian), but when it comes to sushi, it is really an art form, and unless it was passed down from generations before you or you went to the Culinary Institute of America....well, you know what I'm saying...

Loved being greeted by a Maitre' D Loved having the table of the booth pulled out for me Loved the comfy booths Loved the verbal menu Loved the attentive service Loved the Captain/Waiter team thing they got going on Loved how our Captain was such a pro at what he was doing Loved the bread even though it was such a mess Loved my filled to the rim Martini Loved my husbands reasonably priced $6 Sam Adams  Loved the Chopped Salad Loved the fact that the manager came by to ask how everything was Loved the end of the dinner chit-chat with Michael our Waiter... ...so, I'll try to disregard... the OK Lobster Bisque the OK Lyonnaise Potatoes the OK Chicago style bone-in Porterhouse the OK Filet with Bearnaise the OK Creamed Spinach... ...but unfortunately, I won't be able to forget... the 2 $5.95 each small bottled waters the  2 $13 each Grey Goose martinis  the very bad, under cooked souffle and walking out with a $250 tab... ...for two

Of all of the Panda Express chains I have ever tried (from Kihei, Maui, to Las Vegas, NV and now here in the Phoenix area), this one tops them all.  Staff is always nice (which is an added bonus when you get that in any of these types of non tipping establishments) and the food is always good.  They seemed to have beefed up their beef in the their beef and broccoli (but that could just be a coincidence/luck of the draw, whatever...you know what i mean).  Did you ever notice it isn't actually called beef and broccoli, but rather broccoli beef?  haha.  Anyway, if you like Panda's, and you live in the Glendale/Peoria area, it is worth it to go to this one rather than one that may be closer to you.

What can I say???  I love this place!  I go here as often as my checking account lets me, which seems to be more and more...oops!  No wait, I mean less and less...?  Oh yeah, now I remember!...I go here as often as my CREDIT CARD  allows me which seems to be more and more...(haha) anyway---the price of their produce surprisingly not as expensive as you might think.  A lot of it is right in line with Safeway's non sale produce.  AJ's does have weekly sales, so keep your eyes out for their fliers, or just go on line and check them out.  Their meat is awesome...all of it...any of it.  Some of the freshest seafood you can buy, but quite pricey.  If you're not the best BBQ-er or the best chef, buying this quality of meat is a must if you want good steak.  However, if your culinary skills are above average (like mine, toot-toot), then you can get away with Fry's Market aged beef.  This quaint store even offers kitchen gadgets and colorful kitchenware, candles, cards, wrapping paper, gift bags, etc!!!  Not to mention their great wine selection and don't forget their specialty aisles and hard to come by sauces and marinades (try the soy vay line).  Last but a must (guys take note), their floral section is by far the best of all the food chains.  They have unbelievable plants, but expect to pay a pretty penny for them.  You can get little floral bundles at a reasonable price and they are more personal than the bigger grocery chains.  I've heard many good things about their Thanksgiving meals and their catering.  You know---got the in-laws coming to town?  Buy it from AJ's and say you've been slaving all day, they'll be impressed.  I refuse to try the sushi here or anywhere else for that matter unless I'm eating it at a top Resort (see Ritz Carlton review) so I can't comment on that, other than their little sushi/bar (you can drink beer and sake!!!) area is tidy and cozy.  If I ever become a millionaire someday I will shop here 365 days out of the year for my groceries and everything else in between...until then, I'll just be a once a week gal.

****Take this review in stride****  After reading the previous review and  in addition to two acquaintances not liking this place, I am totally surprised that  both my lovable puppy Lexie and I like it so much.  Usually it's the other way around.  But after two unbelievably horrific experiences at Pet Smart that left my dog traumatized for two days after each visit (I took her back a second time only because I thought her first experience was just that, her first experience), we desperately needed to make a change and decide to try Bow Wows... it was close by and seriously, what did we have to lose...?, nothing could be worse than our time with Pet Smart.  Granted, this place leaves a lot to be desired when you walk in (smells bad, very bare bones, no frills), but the groomer did such an awesome job and my dog was not shaking in her skin when I picked her up, I could care less what the place looked like.  No more traumatized Lexie, no more whimpering for two days, no more needing to hold her constantly.  On top of it, the cut was fantastic, she smelled good and was so clean...who could ask for more?   This groomer was able to take my dog, who had not the best grooming experiences and in one visit completely change her outlook.  I think this is totally deserving of at least 4 stars and a try by others who might be experiencing 'puppy-hell-grooming'.    Good luck!

Best fried chicken of all of the supermarket chicken deli's.  Even better than Safeway.  And cheap.  8 pieces for $7.99 normally, and sometimes, when you're lucky, you can get it as low as $4.99 when it's on sale.

I went to this restaurant a couple of years back and had a much better experience with both the service and food.  This time it was quite a disappointment.  Much smaller portions and everything tasted the same.  Food was not presented in an appealing manner (kind of slopped on the plate...what's up with that?!) and as usual, martinis waaay over priced.  I don't mind paying for expensive alcohol, but the food better be up to par or the waiter/ress better be over par.  It seems the quality over all with this particular CF has gone down over the years.

bad food (i actually got indigestion later that night and it didn't even TASTE good, if i'm getting a sour stomach, i at least want it to be well worth it)  bad prices ($150.00, one mid-range wine you could buy for 20$ at Bevmo, 6 beers and 2 vodka martinis) bad bartenders (we had to practically grovel to get any kind of service and her male sidekick wasn't any better)  bad waiter (too busy to talk and chat, and the room was EMPTY)  what more can i say???

This is an in-between 3 star and 4 star rating so I'll tell you...  Why 4? Location, location, location.  I could be in a little hut anywhere near Camelback Mountain and feel relaxed and peaceful!  Rooms were impeccable, bedding some of the best I have seen and felt, great downturn service (bedroom slippers, chocolates, soft light, soft music playing and of course the bed down turned).  The whole place is constructed with that great solid brick, therefore you don't hear your neighbors.  Lobby was very warm and inviting (very impressive considering they are going through renovations and had to relocate lobby...can't wait to see what the permanent one is going to be like).  Frozen grapes served by pool concierge while laying out... really hit the spot.  Filtered H20 with fresh lemon slices at your disposal.  AND...they allow you to take your drink into the pool with you, very cool.  Why 3? When you are really looking forward to eggs benedict in the morning (especially after a night out on the town), and you get them and the yolk is completely SOLID in the center, well...let's just say the great music that was playing in the background of my brain since I arrived  came to a screeching halt, like a needle over an LP (ok, ok, I'm showing my age...).  My husband's Marriott burger was good though and the food was served fairly fast considering it was room service.  Also, the pool is very small and they don't have enough floaters for everyone.  Kind of a first come first serve thing.    I am anxious to see what is done after their renovations and can't wait to go back which is why I'm giving it a 4 star rating even though there were some disappointments.  ps.. there is no lazy river here at this hotel...never had, never will...other reviewer must be talking about JW DESERT RIDGE...hello..

Encountered the rudest and most unprofessional employee here at this venue EVER...what tha f*** ???  Not even the nice ones could make up for it.  We had great seats, right behind Home team Dugout.  Even the fellow fans in the seats around us were great....but this one employee was so completely off the chart lame, I'm going to fault this whole establishment for her suckiness.

This is one heckuva grand Resort, that's for sure.  When you walk into the "lobby" (if you can call it that, grand entrance is more like it), it kind of made me feel a bit small, like i was lost in some sort of Neverland or something...(I'm pretty sure I wasn't on any type of MAD)...anyway, don't expect warm and cozy.  But since I am one for grandness at times, I soaked it up and amazingly found my way to the check-in desk where I was greeted by very austere check-in person.  Friendly she was not, but professional and competent she was!  (And believe me, with some of the IQs running around out there, I will take competent over ANYTHING else, knowhutimean?).  Rooms were nice, clean, the usual of what one would expect from a top tier Resort.  Really, do we notice how nice it is, or is it only when something is askew (unmade bed, water leaking onto the carpet, dirty bathtub, etc) that our attention is directed?  I don't mean to say it was not enchanting or an of the other million adjectives I'm sure this establishment would like me to use, but after one has stayed at many 5 star/diamond/platinum/one-of-a-kind establishments, they all kind of start looking the same....     They have a huge pool and a nice little lazy river off to the side.  I think my girlfriend's and I were too much action for this area (especially after a few cocktails) as the lifeguard kept following us AROUND the lazy river shaking his head.  There was a creepy pool attendant who kept hitting on me which was annoying, but honestly, there were 5 of us ladies, all fairly decent looking, whooping it up, in bathing suits drinking alcohol...you get the picture.  What they are calling as the lobby bar (it is actually down a flight of stairs) was excellent, nice staff, not too stuffy.  And they had live music too.  I don't know if this is a seasonal thing, or what so as far as the music goes, check before going.  After a night of partying celebrating my friend's birthday, let me tell you, the Starbucks just further down the lobby was a godsend, ahhhhhh.  All in all a great over niter with the girls, I would definitely stay here again!

OK guys (and gals too), I know size isn't everything, but OMG, this place has crazy size portions and I loooove it!  We ordered the calamari and the stuffed mushrooms (1/2 orders) and STILL, the servings were huge.  Six big stuffed mushrooms sitting on what seemed to me to be the biggest plate I have ever seen serving an appetizer.  They were great and tasty, but cooled down too quickly and who can do anything about that?  The calamari was decent, could have been spiced up a bit or served with something more than marinara sauce, but for those who don't like a lot of fan fare with their food, this would be perfect; classic calamari with classic sauce.  We loved the Stella Artois draft beer and martinis came out big and filled to the brim, just how I like them.  For our entrees we ordered the Baked Ziti and Sausage and the Rigatoni "D".  Both of them were absolutely fantastic...yumm.  And both were HUGE.  The baked ziti stayed warm right up until we packed the rest to take home because they actually bake it right in the ceramic type dish that they serve it in, very smart.  For those with little ones, the kids menu is awesome and probably the healthiest meal a kid is going to get anywhere.  Nothing at this place is pre packaged or pre made and that goes for the kids meals as well.  Their chicken fingers are home made (the pickiest of adults would eat these things!), no french fries; home made mashed potatoes and broccoli florets.  This is the KIDS menu!  Our waiter needed to be coaxed out of his shell, but he was still warm in that great way that the good ones know how to do without intruding.  Great leather booths, linen napkins, white table cloths with a white and red checkered one thrown on top for added warmth, elegant, but not stuffy.  Guys could go in with t-shirts and dress shorts and fit right in and for the ladies who like to dress up, you can as well with out feeling overly so.  I am definitely going here again, what a find!

A jumbo size Hebrew National hotdog with soda for $1.50???  Who can beat that?  Plus, like other fellow yelpers have said, their pizzas are HUGE.  For $9.99.    This particular Costco's staff has come along way since 4 years ago, but don't expect Neiman Marcus type customer service.  What am I saying??  Don't even expect Target like service!  They are smiling more though...maybe they've gotten enough raises...?  You've gotta be a member and remember, they don't accept the V or MC.

I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately it appears as though the high end stores have decided to fore go their zip code on this one.  On the plus side, it does have a two huge arenas in its corner, so at least you have something to do while waiting for your event to start.  I would have liked to have seen more Kierland type stores in here.  It's a bummer since this place had so much potential.

Of all the Bebe store's in the Valley, this is the one that I have found to have the best customer service.  True, they don't have a huge sale inventory (for that go to the one at Biltmore), however they will go above and beyond in the areas of phone "orders" and have no problem looking for certain items that you may have found on bebe.com, but wish to purchase locally.  I had my husband pick up a dress for me and they knew I was going to be wearing it that evening, (like as soon as he walked in the door we were going right back out for this party), and they PRESSED it for me free of charge!  My husband didn't even ask, they just did it.  Above and beyond, that's what I'm talkin' about...

Miracle Mile???    A Half An Inch is more like it.  Heard good things about this place.  Someone said their pastrami sandwiches were awesome.  So, in all fairness I didn't try their pastrami, but the BLT.  The thing came out on white wonder bread (not toasted so at least some of its 'flavor' could have been burned off) with a glob of mayo in the center of the bread with exactly 3 slices of bacon (not the thick kind) and one measly ice burg lettuce...you get more lettuce than that on a McDonald's burger. Speaking of Mickey D's, my BLT came with as many fries as their small kids Happy Meal, which is actually less than a small on their regular menu.  On top of it, the sucker cost $7 bucks... holy crap, i think i died and went to hell.
