Dive bar heaven! Loved this little gem. Their is a jukebox so you can play your own tunes. The drinks are cheap. The patrons are hilarious. The vibe is awesome and reminds me of little beer joints back east. Go. Drink. Be merry!

Disappointed in the food. The items we ordered were flavorless. Our orders were brought out wrong. Our server was seriously super slow. On the flip side the place is rather nice with a huge outdoor patio. Unfortunately, I do not foresee myself returning here.

I thought my sister was kidding when she told me there was a drive thru liquor place. Wow. This is so convenient and it's located in a plaza that's easy to maneuver around.   I had to pick up a bottle of tequila. Since I don't know much about tequila, the gentleman who is working there gave me a crash course on the different tastes of this one brand of tequila (the one pushed by George Clooney). I never knew there were so many different tastes of this one particular spirit and it was nice that the proprietor took that much time with me regardless of another car getting in line behind me.   They have specials often and their prices (from the ones I could see while being in line) rival the costs of grocery stores.

Closest thing to NYC bagels out here. Makes me feel less homesick! Bagels aren't skimpy small like the ones at Chompies.   Friendly staff. Great bagel selections. Wish they had more cream cheese selections. They have yummy cold cuts as well! They don't place a lot of cheese on their sandwiches so ask for a double of cheese.   Love this place!

I'm a New Yorker and it's been hard finding a pizza place that is like home. While it isn't completely NY style pizza it's pretty close.  **update 7/23/16** don't bother ordering online from them... They say order online and save 20% but they don't honor that when you pickup the food. Lame.

This is our spot for sport watching in the hood. The downside, if you sit outside during the day, you can't see what's on TV. They need to upgrade their outdoor televisions.   The food is good. The beers are cold. The staff is friendly. The atmosphere is jovial. The people watching is the best since the location is right off Camelback.

Never returning again. The service was slow, the food wasn't hot, the drinks seemed watered down. Their food wasn't at all tasty. It seemed as though they didn't marinate their flavors together when it came to food. The place is cute, but the lack of attention from their staff, the subpar drinks and the tasteless food will not make me a regular. I put full bar as an option when prompted but they really don't have a full bar since they only have a few top shelf choices.

Avoid this location at all costs. I'm serious. Do. Not. Go. Here.  My friend and I wanted some noshing and some pasta dishes so we decided to check this place out since it's close to work.  We were the first patrons to sit down since we arrived just when it opened. Our server was courteous but his appearance was disheveled. Come on. You're the face of the restaurant. Put on a clean and unwrinkled shirt! We sat down and our table wasn't even clean. There was salt all over it and crumbs.  Still, we stayed. I don't know why.  We ordered the mussels portofino to start. What. A. Disappointment. The broth, which should be labeled water down, was flavorless and very thin. The mussels tasted old as well.  We opted to leave early and the only reason why I'm giving this place two stars instead of one is because the waiter comped our food.  If you're looking for seafood or great food in the old town area, forget this place. Go to Tommy V's. That's what we should have done.

It's such a change to go back to your "go to" place of years prior and then experience a change in foods. My group of close friends used to always frequent here...   Now? The food isn't the same... It's all about the BREAD to start. The bread now? Great. Not NYC/PA great but it's good.   I will say that I loved the wings. YummmMEEEEE!   Another positive note, the staff was friendly and attentive. That to me is so important. Super. Really really super!   But still... Change I know is good. I just miss my place from days of old.

Martini. Martini. Martini! This place... Oh how I love this place. I've been coming here for years. The food is great. The staff is great. And the martinis are huge! It's also impressive that the waitstaff can deliver your gigantic martini without spilling one drop. Now that the weather is getting nicer, sit on their patio! There is a music festival on Sunday afternoons and you can sit on the patio and listen...while having a martini of course!

I like this place. I love the bartenders. I love their knowledge of beers. While I love love love Mac-n-Cheese, I can say with an authoritative voice that "I will pass on ordering it again." It was pushed on me by the staff when I had a moment most patrons have where you ask "What do I want to eat?" In a valley with Mac-n-cheese competition, I'll stick to my number 1 choice for this comfort food. The Yard, so so for food thus far (and I've sampled a good variety). But the beer? The beer!!! Superb!  Definitely worth visiting again and again just for the great beer, but next time I'll eat before.

So many choices! Now I'm not saying their pizza is east coast fabulous, but it's pretty darn tasty. They also have a good amount of salads to choose from. My all time favorite is the chicken, spinach, walnut. YummmmEeee! The dressing isn't too heavy. The spinach is always fresh and the chicken succulent. It's also a great place to bring kids. I take my nieces here all the time. They have a kid menu and even a beer and wine menu for the over 21 crowd. I've never had to wait too long for service. The staff is awesome. And again, it warrants mentioning again... Great place to bring the kiddos!!!

Yummmmmeeeeeeee! I'm a huge fan of gelato. Huge! It's been hard finding a great spot since I moved out here but I fret no more! Found it! They have so many flavors. They are ALL yummy. They even make their own macaroons! Did I mention it's all Yummy? My favorite gelatos are the raspberry, rum raisin, bacio, and pistachio. I tried the NY Cheesecake. Wasn't too impressed. But the other flavors are quite creamy and delicious.

Seriously in love with this location. Everyone here is super friendly. The food is fresh and delicious. The drive thru is convenient.  Their green tea is so refreshing. The Turkey Club is one of my all time favorites but their bowls are also worth tasting. I haven't tried their burgers but I will one day. The breakfast menu options are also worth trying. I opt for the frittatas or az burro. The oatmeal isn't all that bad but the other items are sooooo much better.

If I wasn't so happy with my neighborhood I would want to move so I am closer to this location. Oh. My. God... This place is huge. They have everything, but my favorites are the wine bar, sushi station and candy apple station. Fall is approaching and if you haven't tried one of their candy apples then you are missing out!!!

So many things that are yummy here! I'm a huge fan of their chicken pho. I've sampled other items on their menu like the delicious ginger drink (totally forget the name but it's so worth drinking). Their noodle dishes are flavorful and filling. But trust me, the Pho is amazing. It's a huge order as well for the money. You can easily share it with another person. The decor isn't anything fancy but the staff is super sweet and have offered me so many different tastes to try. Never been disappointed!

I always forget about this tucked away little lunch spot in Kierland. Today I bought the tuna melt which comes on their cranberry and walnut bread. Oh my. What a treat that was! I love tuna but I'm not often a fan of fancy bread. Consider me amazed. I also had to treat myself and get a lemon bar. Shame on me... But it tastes so good!

As a New Yorker who's now living in the desert... It's been hard finding a great pizza place. I'm giving this location 4 stars instead of 3 because their sauce was very tasty and their staff was friendly and courteous.   Their pizza dough? Not great. Which is sad. I was completely excited when I saw this location and couldn't wait to try it. The dough was too stiff to be even compared to NY dough.   I'll definitely go back and try other dishes. Alas, I won't be consuming the pizza again.

Seriously annoying that they never have enough employees working at this location. I've been in three times to make an appointment on separate occasions and the wait time is completely ridiculous.   While this location is easy to get to, it's not easy to deal with.

Not only is this place close to my house, but it's open 24/7. You didn't misread that... Isn't that awesome? Coming from NYC, it's a rarity to find the conveniences of home from places open that late and often.   Almost everything on their menu is homemade. Their scones and muffins are flavorful and are a decent size. Their coffee is so good. Their omelets and burritos are the bomb. I love their chorizo ones best. The burritos come with homemade salsa.   They also have dinner and lunch options and I haven't tried them yet but I will be as soon as possible. The menu is extensive and they also offer up Mimosas and Bloody Mary's on the weekend (obviously these are only dine-in options).

One of my favorite Sunday sports places. Have been here a few football Sunday's. They have a Bloody Mary and Mimosa special during select hours. The food is delicious. I have sampled many things on their menu over the last year. Haven't had a disappointing meal. My only gripe is the staff. They don't have enough bartenders working during busy sports days. The waitstaff is pleasant but they are slow.

I'm all for the indulgences of fried food every now and again, but I tend to get the Strawberry Fields salad (and every time I sing the line from the famous song).   I can't believe I haven't written a review yet. I've been eating at this location for over two years now. Sooo pleased.   There's a new face, at least to me. His name is Sean and he was what I love about people who work in the restaurant business. Personable. Happy. Helpful. I could go on.   As a whole, I really enjoy coming here on Sunday Fundays or to watch the game or to get this seriously flipping fantastic salad!

I kept hearing about this place. People told me their burgers were better than Five Guys. Alas, I do not hold the same regard. I found Smashburger's burgers greasy. Maybe some people enjoy this. I did not. Also, their burgers didn't have a great flavor. Their buns were quite soggy as well. The fries (and I sampled all 3 varieties) were mediocre at best. I'll stick to other burger places from now on.

Obsessed with their chai latte. It's the bomb. The ambiance is fantastic. You can sit for a while, work on your laptop with their complimentary wifi. The only down side is if they are busy they get a little backed up. But their products are worth the wait!!

***update: Even though Ann doesn't have someone taking appointments for her, anytime I need her or need an appointment I just text her and she gets back to me within a day.   I had searched and searched for an eyebrow expert. Finally!! I found Ann. She fixed my arch and design and I couldn't be happier. Her prices are super reasonable and her waxing room is relaxing. She also carries the Blinc eye line products. Obsessed with their liquid liner, amplified mascara and eyeliner pencil!! (Sorry, Ann! I posted this on Jennifer's salon site by accident at first!)

4.5 Stars  Tried a few food items:  *The tortillas and salsa - surprised the salsa wasn't spicier. The bean dip they also place on the table was tasted but it lacked any flavor so after one taste, I didn't go back for another.  *Guacamole Sol - bursts of flavors and I wish we ordered two! *Chorizo and Mushroom Queso - by far a favorite thing we tried but eat it while it's hot. When it gets cold it's not the same and it's not as tasty.  *Grilled Sweet Corn - flavorful and just enough grill taste.  *Street Tacos - we ordered the shrimp and steak. The steak was okay but the shrimp with the mango salsa was bursting with flavor.  *Peel and Eat Shrimp - our second favorite of the dishes we tasted. The shrimps are a great size, the seasoning is lick-your-fingers delicious.   All of the dishes were amazing. We also tried their Cucumber Jalapeño Margarita. Yummy. The only down side to our experience was our server. He wasn't very attentive and we had to ask other servers passing by for additional items.

I love this place!!! My life would be missing something if I never found HYU. Each and every instructor there is amazing, but of course I still have my favorites. And now that they offer Iron Yasa (that's hot yoga with weights), I'm in complete heaven. I'm a lifer, that's for sure.

There has been some new additions to the studio. New teachers. New clothing lines. New weight loss products. And new classes!  Haven't been? Here's what they offer for classes:  H-27: it's an abbreviated version of the 90 minute traditional Bikram class only you're doing the poses once and the class is only 60 minutes.   Flow: my favorite of the classes... Music. Music! Music and flow yoga! It's awesome and you sweat so much more. 60 minutes.   IY: Iron Yasa... Basically the flow class in abbreviated form with the addition of weights. If you haven't taken it yet then please use the lighter weights. Trust me, your arms will thank you. 45 minutes.   Nidra: a deep meditation class. A 45 minute class that equates to 3-4 hours of sleep.   Come in!!!

I wish Yelp had a "love" button instead of just stars. After living in NYC for so many years, I was fearful about finding a stylist and hair extension expert in my new home town. Katy's new salon space has a personal and cozy feel. I felt so comfortable there and will definitely be returning. Since I've dealt with hair extensions before, I was amazed and thrilled at how fabulous and natural the hair felt and how quickly Katy got me out of to salon chair. We all have things in our life we can't live without. Fabulous hair is one of them. Katy spent the time going over all the different color blends her salon offers. She has both wavy and straight hair, and I found myself debating which I loved more. Katy took the time to go over and show me how to style my hair so it could look as if I stepped out of a salon each and every day. Thank you, Katy!! You have made me so happy :)

Even though their juices are on the expensive side, I have become a believer in their concoctions. I recently drank the Flu Shot. I never would have known about it if I wasn't following them on FB. For a limited time the shop was giving away free drinks of this with another purchase. I haven't tried the Grapefruit one yet because every single time I go there they are sold out of it. That is a drawback of this place, they don't seem to be able to keep up with customer demands. I wish they would have more juices in stock because I hate not getting the drinks I want. But the ones I have tried... I love!

I LOVE this juice bar. If I'm feeling lethargic or the beginnings of a cold or if I just want a yummy juice, I head straight in! Love the girls who work here too. My personal favorites are the River, Dusti Beet and the Flu Shot. They also have this one that tastes like coffee... Yummmm-meeee!

Our server, Ashlii... Awesome! I have always loved the food but have never wanted to rave about the service since the bartenders here are usually rude and inattentive. Ashlii was on point with everything without being overbearing or in your face every two seconds. So happy the staff has made some changes here!!! Now if only they could work on their bartenders' customer service...

Miguel's tacos are so yummy. The food is fresh. The pico is awesome with a little bite of spice. They now have flour tacos! The price is super reasonable. Try the homemade Horchata!  There's street tacos and then there's the ones from this location. I seriously need them each week. That's not a joke. I wish Miguel made his pico for sale because I would use it at home. Yes. It's that good.  The chicken and steak tacos are some of the best I have had in the valley. Gabriella (one of the awesome people who work there) told me that they marinate the meat to make sure it's as tasty as possible.  When you drive by them, no matter the time of day, there are always people in line. That says a lot when you look around and see who their neighbors are in the area who also have tacos on their menus.

Loved the beer selections... But disappointed in their menu. We had an appetizer, definitely would get it again (turkey chili fritos). But my entree, the chicken breasts, left me with nothing to remember. The dish was bland and lacking. A friend ordered the Rueben and was also disappointed.   On a different note... The staff is super friendly, the service is quick and they have a ton of TVs. I'll be back for college football games and beers as long as they air the Irish. And the veggie chips! Those things were amazing! Definitely order them with the Turkey Chili Fritos!!

I will admit... Before my first drip I was wondering "will this work for me?"   Adios skepticism.  I love the drips. I haven't tried them all because I haven't needed some (like the hangover one, don't know if I should binge drink for the sole purpose of trying the hangover drip--haha).  My family and I all go here. We keep going back for two reasons... One: the drips WORK! Two: the staff is awesome (love you guys!).  The vitamin b12 shots, you can add more to them if you want... that was something I had no idea was even an option. I've also had the drips when I was sick. For me, I can't take prescription medicine (medical allergies). This place is a godsend for those in my situation.  And the atmosphere in there is cool. I kind of want to steal their light fixtures for my house.

I've worked in the restaurant and bar business for over a decade and I just don't get the concept of INT'L. They claim to be a champagne bar and yet I have not once seen anyone with champagne in hand nor does the decor go hand-in-hand with the classic bubbly theme, nor any modern bubbly one. And Ultra Lounge!? Where? Where is this Lounge area? If they are referring to the tabled off sections or the ill-placed "lounge" smack dab in the middle of the dance floor then, I guess that's their idea of a lounge. I hear the word Lounge and I think of the old Pearl that used to be in this area. That was comfy lounge-like.   If this club was in New Jersey, it would thrive beyond belief. Sorry, but that's not a compliment. The club owner should have consulted another designer before going with this outdated and lackluster looking interior.   My friends and I have gone here a few times, but those times are always when we have east coast friends in town (see what I mean about NJ?).   I secured a table here on three separate occasions, obviously not learning from the first mistake. We had to serve ourselves all night. We rarely saw our cocktail waitresses (this occurrence happened each time we had tables).   For the hype of what they advertise (and Yeesh do they need to tone it down with the gawdy Jersey Shore looking ads... My head hurts every time I see one on Instagram), this club falls way short. With new hip and cool clubs and bars going up around them or ones giving themselves a fresh look (like El Hefe), INT'L needs to do something before they succumb to the same fate as their across the street and no longer in business neighbor Derby (now Bevvy).   You have such a great location, INT'L! I want to see more from you because as patrons we expect more. Time for a face lift!

I've sampled a few things from their menu a few times. The cheeseboard is kind of skimpy. The crab cake is pretty good. The lamb pops are way way way too salty. They have a pretty nice wine and beer menu so that's at least one plus. Another plus is their shrimp Mac-n-cheese. YummmmmEeeee!   Love the decor. It doesn't feel like you're in a strip mall type place. The service is fast, the staff is friendly. The chef has some pretty awesome creations that I still want to try so even though some things weren't to my liking, I'll still plan on sampling more from the menu.   Side Note: Okay okay. I know I don't normally comment on the look of the staff at eateries but this place? Whoooo Weeeeee!! The bartenders (both male and female) are so cute! And the waitstaff (only male on the nights I've been ... Yay for me) is really handsome.

They have soooooo many drinks to choose from here. The food was so-so and I probably won't eat here again but the drinks!!! The drinks are worthy for coming back again and again. There's a drink that even comes with its own back scratcher! Crazy! The staff is pretty amazing but service is a little slow so either be patient or don't come here if you're in a hurry to go go go go go. It's a great happy hour spot as well. Came here with a few friends a couple of times.

I LOVE this location. I love the staff. I love the food. I LOVE LOVE the food. Coming from the east coast, we had great Greek places around every corner. Out here, not so much.   They have so many dishes and platters to choose from. I love their chicken ones best. I haven't tried the lamb yet but it's on my list to taste next.   Their hummus and their sauces are amazing. I can't stand when Greek places have watery sauces. Not here! The owners son who's in high school works here when he isn't in school, obviously. He has suggested something for me to try every time I have been in. Haven't been steered wrong yet!   It's tucked in the back in the plaza which is why for so long I didn't even notice its existence. But now? I won't go anywhere else for Greek.

What we ordered:  House Potato Chips with herb and truffle oil: these were really flavorful and there's always a scare that places will use too much oil... Not the case here! Will definitely order again.   Prime Rib Sandwiches with a side salad: The beef was juicy and flavorful. The au jus was okay. The horseradish spread was pretty flipping amazing. The bread was the less satisfying part of the dish. The side salad came with a light cucumber ranch dressing --- Yum!   Fish Tacos with a side salad: Flavorful and not at all small like that picture another Yelper added to the restaurant's photos.     The prices seem reasonable but not for the seafood dishes. I get it, we're in the desert... But a lobster roll or lobster wedge (not ordered because we saw how skimpy it looked) in a Long Island themed restaurant shouldn't look like a lobster roll/wedge in a Scottsdale restaurant if that's the price tag. Lobster roll was $19! I'll stick to Cousins Maine Lobster Truck for my lobster fixes when they are in town (how an authentic east coast lobster roll should look).  The bar staff was great. Our group ordered some beers, some vodka drinks. They have fresh pressed juice here so my friend and I ordered Salty Dogs. Refreshing.   Between 3 of us, with some alcohol ordered, our bill total was a little over $100. Not bad in my opinion.   The decor reminded me of a nod to the old town Devil's Martini from back in the day. Very clean, crisp, white and inviting... Only one thing I didn't get about the decor was the out of place Arizona decor area mixed with the attempt to feel like a restaurant on Long Island (to those who may question me... I would know what those feel like since I lived in NYC area over 20 years & frequented LI/Montauk every summer).

Horrible. Don't go here! The upside is the friendly staff. The downside (and it's an important one) the food is terrible.   We went here for lunch today. There were three of us so we ordered a few items. The calamari was overly breaded and not very tasty. The corn chowder had a distinct and weird aftertaste. The crab cakes (which DID NOT have lump crab meat) were mushy and watery. The fish and chips... I can't even think of how to describe them... Gross. The Asian Slaw was the only tasty thing we had.   If I could give zero stars I would. This place is a step down from Red Lobster.   Not worth the money. Not worth getting frustrated over. Just heed my warning and stay far far away.

Huge fan. Huge. I'll edit my post with a link to my restaurant review once it's finished.   So many amazing things to mention.   The staff first: it all starts with who you have pushing your brand. Kudos to Craft 64 in who they employed. Knowledgable staff. I threw as many curve ball questions at our server and he was quick to explain things.   I love how they converted an old 1937 house into such an inviting space. Not taking away from the integrity of the space, they moved the bathrooms to what used to be the carriage house out back. Don't worry. They have renovated the space perfectly.   Now to the important part... THE BEER!  Oh my gosh. They gave 36 beers on tap. Of those 36 (and I lost count on how many) you can get various brews in Growler size! So not only can you experience yummy craft beers in their inviting indoor space or outdoor cozy space, you can bring home any of the LOCALLY selected brews.  Sigh... They had me at growler.   The prices are reasonable and their happy hour is everyday, yes everyday, from 4-7pm!   Hidden little happy gem in old town. Can't believe for over a year I haven't known they exist.

No secret. I love local spots and I love giving them props. Thumbs up to this little hidden gem. Hands down the best donuts I have had since moving to the valley. We've tried the prickly pear cactus and key lime donuts. I'll be back to try the maple and glazed ones. They are super filling and that's the only thing I disliked because I wanted to eat more! The staff is friendly and the place is decorated in the minimal which works. It's easy to drive right by them and not even know they're in this plaza so be on the look out next time you're driving on Hayden!
