The food was outstanding! I have the Honey Chipotle wings and the Habanero Mango. You'll love them both. The Habanero Mango came with more sauce on the wings. Regrettably, two of them were dried out. The Honey Chipotle were good also.  Great experience.  Check them out.

The place is simple.  Don't expect anything fancy.  However, expect to get a great burger.  A bunch of friends and I came here after a game.  I initially thought it would be a mistake to go in.  I was pleasantly surprise.  Try them out. You'll enjoy it.

The decor is beautiful. The waitress was one of the best! I had the McCormick's Seafood Trio. You'll only get three small grilled shrimps and three small stuff shrimp. They were tasty but...  The salmon was about 1/6 of normal cut. It was seasoned well.  The coffee must be a house blend. It was unspectacular.  In sum, I haven't been impressed with M&C. I went to the one at the National Harbor (MD) also. On both occasions I received some good food but nothing worth the price. You will not be disappointed but you won't walk away saying, "This is the best meal ever."  We had debated about going Lawry's or M&C. I can't say it was a bad decision to come to M&C since the food was pretty decent.

The best coffee place around. I wish I had gotten the barista's name. He was great!  Go here. The rest of the coffee places will just be a disappointment.

A must go to! We had the mini brat slider and the BBQ chicken slider. They were ok. I had beer-braised Sirloin Tips. It was fantastic. It was the best meal I've had in LV. I loved every bite.  My wife had the Gorgonzola Pear salad. Hmmm. The dressing was watered down. It wasn't appealing nor did it taste that great.  The waitress was awesome. The service was great. Don't miss your chance to go to this place!

$4 for coffee water!  We walked all over the Strip to find a good cup of coffee. McDonald's coffee is far superior. That should give you an idea had bad this coffee tasted.  Sorry McDonald's, I should not have compared you to such horrible coffee.  Side note. The service was really good.

I visited here last Saturday.  Great customer service. I had the BBQ platter. I wished they would've given me more sauce.  However, the food was great.
