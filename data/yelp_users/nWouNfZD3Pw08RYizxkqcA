It's usually a ghost town at the downtown Phoenix bars, but when a game and/or concert is happening, suddenly the bars are bustling. Such was the case last night at Majerle's, former Phoenix Suns player Dan Marjerle's sports bar. With the Beyonce concert across the street at the arena AND a D-backs game at the ball park, Phoenix was a hoppin'.  My friend and I stopped into Majerle's, which I've been to a few times before, for dinner and drinks before going to see Beyonce. I had a cheeseburger and Cesar Salad. While I realize it's hard to mess up a Cesar Salad, my salad was seriously the best Cesar I've ever had. And my burger was packed with flavor. No wonder AOL  named them Best Burgers two years in a row. We also had a wonderful chocolate martini (with Vanilla Vodka, not creme based) here. And on Fridays if you're in the mood to really start the night, the bar offers a Corona or Pacifico with a shot of tequila for $7 as part of their Sizzlin' Friday special.  My only complaint was that our waitress suddenly went M.I.A for about 15 minutes when we were trying to close our tab so we could go to the show.  But I'm still going to cut them some slack because this is one of a few fun places to drink in the downtown area.  HOT TIP: A second Majerle's will be opening in Chandler in the fall.

Hotel San Carlos is known for its hauntings. Twenty-two year-old Leone Jensen jumped off the hotel's rooftop in 1928 and rumor has it that she's one of many spirits that haunt the historic downtown Phoenix hotel. Guests often say that she can be spotted around the hotel in a white evening gown.   According to the staff, Jensen is one of many ghosts who haunt the hotel. Guests have also reported hearing children's laughter late at night and phones often wake people up in the middle of the night and no one is on the line.  Want to decide for yourself if the hotel is truly haunted? Check in if you dare and look for one of the late night security guards. If you ask nicely, they'll give you a tour of the hotel and its allegedly haunted basement. Just be sure to tip them for their time.  And if you're looking for something more G-rated, the hotel usually has ghost tours around Halloween.

Hard Rock Cafe is a cool place to go if you're in the area and want to kill time before a concert or a game, but destination bar it's not. The food is average and the drinks aren't anything out of the ordinary. Infact, there's nothing really unique about the Hard Rock aside from the fact that they jacked up the prices because you're dining and/or drinking at the HARD ROCK CAFE.   I'm disappointed that it doesn't compare to others around the world and seems out of place in Phoenix. A Hard Rock Scottsdale would be way cooler.

A concert venue without booze? How can it be? Those were my thoughts when I went to a local music showcase here a month ago and realized I was going to have to watch a show without my trusty beer in my hand. The horror!  Since they don't have a bar, the venue attracts that all-ages crowd, which translates to under 21. I'm not a fan of being packed in with the mini Pete Wentz and Avril Lavigne's of this world so I was miserable in this small spot.  If you're underage, you'll probably dig it here. It is a great place to see the up-and-coming indie rock bands. If you're 21-or-over, just be prepared to do this without a drink in hand.      It's usually packed with a very young crowd and the small venue doesn't serve any alcohol. A concert veny

Welcome to one of Phoenix's classiest bars. With its dim lights, sleek designs and sexy lounge atmosphere, the Merc Bar would easily be at home in Scottsdale. However, it doesn't have the snooty vibe that clubs like Six and Dirty Pretty Rockbar give off.    The drinks are pricey, the bartenders pour strong to give you more bang for your buck. And you may even see a celebrity or two here. A few years ago I spotted R&B singer Brandy.  You'll feel like you've been transported into an episode of "Sex & The City" here. There's no doubt that Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte would give Merc Bar two thumbs up.

While the hamburgers are delicious here, I can't get enough of the grilled cheese. A perfect lunch -- when I'm not counting calories -- is a grilled cheese and hashbrowns, my favorite combination at this East Mesa strip mall gem. And if you have room, be sure to wash it down with a thick Chocolate shake. Lunch definitely won't set you back. Everything is extremely cheap and the eats will put you in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon.

The cheese and the pepperoni on my mini pizza glisten, taunting me to dive in. I scarf down my pizza in a matter of minutes and rub my belly, thinking, 'I'll have to do a few more crunches tonight but it was well worth it.'  This is the usual battle I have when I go to Chandler's Floridino's for lunch with the gang where it's always a struggle to avoid the calzone, which is seriously the best calzone I've ever had in my life.    Floridino's is one of my favorite lunchtime destinations because the service is good and the pizza is dyn-O-mite. And you can get a  mini pizza and a drink for under $5 during lunch time. Lunch doesn't get any better than this.

While the Tempe Pita Jungle will always be my favorite, I can't help but appreciate the different atmosphere of its sister location in Chandler. The restaurant is large AND offers a bar. During the day, it attracts more of a family atmosphere along with young professionals on their lunch break.  It's more of a hot date spot at night. It does overlook a lake, which makes it a bit romantical.  You'll find all the usual suspects on the menu. Be sure to try the Roasted Pepper Hummus, the Pesto Pizza or the Pita Pizza for some deliciousness.  BIG NEWS: There's a new Pita Jungle opening in Mesa, across from Mesa Community College, in December.

Hey guys if you're looking for a cougar (read: a sexy older sugar mama), Devil's Martini is your den. The place is filled with older women in their late 30s to late 40s on most weekend nights who are on the prowl. The music is loud, but the crowd doesn't seem to care. And while the word 'martini' is in the bar's name, you're still going to see a lot of people drinking beer. Personally I find this bar cheesy. And parking is riddiculous on the weekend. If you're looking for a fun dance club, try the Devil's in downtown Scottsdale.

I went to see the 5 p.m. showing of "Evan Almighty" recently and had a fun experience. The theatre is unlike any movie theatre I've ever been to and I love that you can order dinner and cocktails during the screening. The menu is large and diverse and there's even a children's menu. This is a good place for families and couples. It's not ideal for a night out with the girls.

Dilly's Deli is one of my favorite lunchtime destinations. They use Boar's Head meat and the bread is crisp and fresh. The deli offers a plethora of sandwich combos. I recommend the Honey Do (turkey, tomato and cheddar cheese with alfalfa sprouts and honey mustard). I've never had anything I didn't like at Dilly's. Their salads are hearty. Be sure to try the Greek salad. They're cookies are delightful and I love the large, zesty pickles. They also serve delicious bread bowls, which are huge. My favorite is the Wisonsin Cheese.   Dilly's is a no-frills lunch and dinner hangout. It's usually filled with college students and young professionals. I recommend getting there at 1 p.m. if you go for lunch because there's usually a line out the door after Noon.

When Arizona Mills first opened, I was a fan of this massive one-story mall. But over the years, it's lost the appeal. While I still love some of the shops such as Shoe Pavilion, Bebe and the Saks Fifth Avenue outlet, it's very rare that I'll head to Arizona Mills unless it's a week day when it's a little more quiet.  Weekends are  a nightmare here. It's g-h-e-t-t-o. The mall has become quite the high school hangout and it's a favorite with parents who flood the mall with their strollers and walk at an extremely slow pace.  While it's great to have such a big mall near my pad, I'd rather make the drive to Fashion Square on the weekends.

Byblos has some of the best Middle Eastern food I've ever tasted. Their falafels and Tzatziki are delicious. And the restaurant serves up an amazing tomato cream soup which will have you lapping up every last bite. This is a great lunchtime destination.

I used to be a fan of Jiffy Lube because the service is usually quick and affordable. Plus, they also fill up your tires. But lately, it's turned into a long process where they usually try to sell me on something after I've been waiting for an hour. I always say no and just stick to the oil change. It seems like more often than not, they find stuff that doesn't need to be changed or taken care of right away. I'll leave the more expensive stuff to my ever so trustworthy mechanic.

The Dodge Theatre is one of my favorite places to see a show because you can sit almost anywhere and still have a great view of the stage. The Black Eyed Peas, comedian Kathy Griffin and Snow Patrol are a few of the acts who have performed at this cool venue. There's usually a lot of parking. And the Dodge has some awesome upcoming shows -- Poision headlines this week and Gwen Stefani will perform two intimate shows in November (Nov. 8-9).

The colorful, quirky building seems out of place in a quiet city like Mesa. Located off of First Avenue and Country Club, the arts center is a fun place to see a mellow and intimate show. Mesa-turned-national act Jimmy Eat World recently performed to a sold-out crowd in the arts center and Valley medium Allison DuBois (from NBC's "Medium") packed them in last year when she hosted a book discussion and signing. The arts center has a lot of potential. They just need to bring in bigger people and bands to garner some attention.

Whatever you do, don't talk smack about Chicago or the beloved Cubs at this Mesa sports bar, which is a haven for Cubby fans.  Here's a bit of history for you -- its original owners were none other than legendary sports announcer Harry Caray and former Major League pitcher/current Cubs announcer Steve Stone.  Sports memorabilia decorates the walls. There's games a plenty to watch and a jukebox. Sluggo's is a big destination for people wanting to watch the game or just hang out before or after a spring training game. They offer the usual bar food and the drinks are pretty cheap.

This is a prime place to drink and dine. You'll usually encounter a line out the door on weekend nights, but the greasy pizza is well worth the wait. I love the chicken parmigiana, which comes with big cubes of tender chicken and oozes with cheese. Slices range from $2.50-$3 and whole pizzas are $15-$19. Slices also has a sister location on Mill Avenue in Tempe.

The Crown Room is a destination bar. Chances are, you won't run across it during a night of club hoppin' in downtown Scottsdale. But that's OK. It's worth the search. Located next to NV Lounge and across the street from a bank, The Crown Room is an upscale lounge with a large martini menu. The drinks can sometimes be a little pricey, but try heading out on Thursdays when the bar hosts its ladies night. There's complimentary champagne and half-price martinis for the ladies. Be sure to try the mouth watering cookie dough martini if you're looking for something scrumptious.

Dos is my favorite Scottsdale bar because of the relaxed atmosphere. Thankfully you don't get as much of the fake crowd here, you know the one whose crazy photos end up on DirtyScottsdale.com the next day. There's two floors and the bar offers a nice selection of brews. SoCo Lime is the big shot here and you'll usually see people sipping Corona's with lime. You may even see the occasional body shot. While this is certainly a great destination for a night out, it's also a great place to do some day drinking when the weather isn't so hot.

Coke and grease! Coke and grease! Coke and grease!  These are the words my friends and I usually chant when we're looking for a place to sober up after a night on the town. Hallelujah for Mickey's Hangover. The relaxed patio bar, which is open until 4 a.m. on the weekends, is our savior on these drunken nights when we need a little coke and grease to sober up.  Don't count the calories, just order the cheese fries. After all, you already spent the night throwing back shots and beer like there's no tomorrow. The cheese fries are piled high and ooze with cheese and make for a wonderful treat in the late night hours.  Bring some cash before you head to this late night haunt. They usually charge a $3 cover for after hours.

You'll find that perfect little black satin number to surprise you're boyfriend with at this Scottsdale Fashion Square lingerie store along with hot bras, saucy panties and comfortable sleep wear like the popular PINK collection.   Like Shannon said, the prices aren't exactly cheap so be prepared to dish out a little more money for that gem studded-bra. And look out for the massive semi-annual sale where people raid the drawers and racks.  In addition to an ample selection of lingerie , the store offers make up and fragrances. I'm hooked on the Love Spell perfume and the cup cake lip gloss. Two must haves in the beauty department!

Sugar Bowl Sundays was a tradition my best friend and I implemented after we both went through bad break ups last year. We spent Sundays at the retro downtown Scottsdale ice cream parlor where we drowned our sorrows in hot fudge sundaes or chocolate malts for a month. It was a good way to forget our sadness, have fun and lose ourselves in this weekly tradition where we would catch up on the week's events.  Plus, it was better than doing a a few Jaeger Bombs and ultimately crying and/or making out with a random stranger later.  While we don't need the therapy of Sugar Bowl Sundays any longer, it's still fun to pop in from time to time and splurge. I think everyone should treat themselves to a Sugar Bowl Sunday every now and then.       Details: 4005 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale (480) 946-0051.

Talk about great date spot! The Roaring Fork screams cute and cozy and is located off the beaten path of the typical array of downtown Scottsdale restaurants.  Be sure to try the scene-stealing green-chili macaroni and cheese. It's out of this world. And wash it down with a fruity Huckleberry Margarita, their signature cocktail.

Can't afford to to head to the South Pacific? Head to Drift!  It's certainly not as pricey and you don't have to hop on a plane.   Downtown Scottsdale's Polynesian restaurant & bar is a hot spot for happy hour -- they offer a discounted menu on appetizers and selected cocktails. You'll undoubtebly get lost in the tropical atmosphere with the fiery torches and giant Tiki God statue. The drinks have fun names like the Evil Bastard, the Big Chief and the Day Tripper and our served in funky glasses. The food is also tasty.   There's more of a club scene here on weekend nights with pulsating beats so if that's not your bag, stick to the happy hour. Check out driftlounge.com for more info on the bar.

When I think of Martini Ranch, the word Metalhead comes to mind. This is the place to be on Sundays when the 80s hair metal tribute bands take the stage every week for three sets of music. You'll hear covers from Bon Jovi, Poison, Motley Crue and Guns 'N Roses. The bar is always packed on Sundays and the crowd is a fun one. Martini Ranch also features live bands, usually cover bands, but the occasional touring one comes through along with DJs upstairs in the Shaker Room and inexpensive drinks.

As far as dive bars go, the Rogue rocks. It's dingy, small, dark and PBR flows like water at this south Scottsdale haven, which is popular with punk rockers and indie rock types.   The hipster bar used to be slammed on Mondays when they hosted their 50-cent PBR night. Now Saturdays are the night to see-and-be-seen. DJ/promoter William Reed brings Shake!, a popular weekly rock 'n' roll dance party, to the bar every week with notable guests DJs such as Belle & Sebastian or the Hot Hot Heat.   You'll find faux-hawked haired people dancing on the small dance floor along with the tattooed-and-the-pierced on Saturdays. And believe me, it IS a scene.  Mike Joyce of The Smiths will be taking over the wheels of steel for a special guest DJ set on Saturday, Sept. 29. Check out williamreedpresents.com for a calendar of who's going to be spinning  during Shake!.

Molly Maids is pretty hit or miss for a cleaning service. We used them awhile back and they did a pretty good job aside from missing some little things, then we used them a few months ago and they missed some big things such as DUSTING. Considering they send two housekeepers out to the house, I was pretty disappointed.  And they charged us for 2.5 hours for cleaning a small townhome. Seems a little long to me for such a small place.

Tempe's Four Peaks is big with Valley hipsters, college students and local musicians. The food is delicious. The bar offers an abundance of brews and they even give brewery tours so people can learn about the crafting process through something I like to call Beer 101. I'm a big fan of the bar's large patio, which overlooks 8th St. It's a great place to socialize and kick back with a cold glass of Framboise (try it if you're in the mood for something fruity!) and people watch. Be forewarned, parking is a pain here since the lot is small, but there's usually a decent amount of street parking and they even offer valet service.

When I was an ASU student, I lost track of time when I was in Hoodlums. This music store rocks!!! Located in the Memorial Union, the store is like a smaller version of Zia. The staff knows their music so be sure to hit them up with any questions you may have or even throw some music trivia there way. They love to be challenged! The store typically hosts live concerts and autograph signings a few times a semester so keep your ears open.

This mega-chain brewery is nothing to call home about. If you want a cool brewery head to Four Peaks -- that's where it's at! Gordon Biersch is stuffy, over-priced and the servers have attitude. The food is mediocre considering the prices and the bar is ho-hum. The highlight? The second floor balcony, which is fun for people watching.

The Tempe Pita Jungle is basically a who's who of the local music scene. When I was dining on my lunch break this afternoon, I counted 10 musicians in the restaurant from Valley bands. It's also the Casey Moore's of restaurants -- meaning you'll probably run into someone you know there 9 times out of 10. And the food is amazing. The hummus is delicious and the Pita Pizza, which is topped with lettuce, hearty tomatoes and feta cheese over a pita, is out of this world. The service can be spotty but it's worth it for the food.

The Tempe comedy club, which has been featured on NBC's "Last Comic Standing" twice, draws some of the biggest comedy headliners from around the U.S. Jerry Seinfeld, David Spade, Jay Mohr and Kathy Griffin have all taken the stage at this hot comedy room. Former "Saturday Night Live" comedian sold out all of his performances at the club last weekend! And the Improv recently debuted the Cabaret, an intimate 95-person showroom attached to the club. The room will serve as a stage for up-and-coming comedians, local comedians and one-man shows. Todd Glass from the second season of  "Last Comic Standing" sold out the room a few weeks ago.

I spent most of my first year being legal drinking age at this wild, college bar. It was fun then, but I got older, it wore on me. It's a big ASU bar and there's no escaping the drunk college kids. The guys can usually be found on the patio barking lame pick up lines at the female passerbys and the ladies are usually grinding it up on the small dance floor on the weekend nights.  With the summer heat, Fat Tuesdays frozen drinks are appreciated. But if you don't want to drink them with the college crowd, hit the bar during the day or early evenings.

Top's has the largest array of spirits that I've ever seen in a liquor store. It's like the Disneyland of liquor stores. You'll find everything from the hard-to-find Agwa (an herbal liqueur) to 30 kinds of vodka and tequila.  And their beer selection is crazy! The staff is extremely knowledgable about the products they carry and will be able to help you find whatever you need.

Although patio bars are a dime of dozen in the Valley,  there isn't one that stands out quite like Casey Moore's. People come out in droves to this charming century-old-house-turned neighborhood-bar, which is rumored to be haunted.  Guinness flows like water. The bartenders know nearly everyone by name. And the patio is a favorite among Valley hipsters, hippies and musicians, garnering a who's who in the Valley nightlife scene. Jimmy Eat World frontman Jim Adkins even named-dropped the Ninth and Ash haunt on the band's track "If You Don't, Don't."

Tott's is one of my favorite lunchtime destinations and offers a medley of Asian flavors. The dishes are large so they're perfect to split if you come with a group and I recommend that you do just that.   The service is fast. The food is delicious and the owner is extremely sweet. We've been coming there for years so on occasion, he'll bring us an extra dish to sample like the amazing Walnut Shrimp.  Some of my favorites are the Kung Pao and Orange Chicken. I also recently had the Bourbon Chicken, which is out of sight. If you haven't been here, check it out. Support this mom-and-pop establishment opposed to a chain like Pei Wei.

If you drive anything less then a Lexus, I don't recommend valeting it at this uber pretentious spot where people love to show off their flashy wheels -- the parking lot seriously looks like a car show with Mercedes, BMWs, Hummers, Corvettes and lamborghinis  which line the valet area -- and Prada attire.   This is where the north Scottsdale twenty to fortysomething crowd goes to see-and-be-seen.   I recommend hitting the bar during happy hour if you want to have some drinking money left over for the weekend. The bar offers a discounted menu and the sushi is pretty good. And it's always packed during happy hour.  People don't come to Sapporo for the food though. They come to meet their Mr. or Ms. Right Now. But it's all about image here so be conscious of that or you're in for one heck of a surprise.

What do singer Nick Lachey, Cardinals quarterback Matt Leinart and Phoenix Suns point guard Steve Nash have in common? They were hanging poolside together a few months ago for Leinart's birthday celebration at the see-and-be-seen Mondrian pool.   My friends and I couldn't believe our eyes when we spotted the trio along with the majority of the Suns and Cards in the pool during a  girls' weekend at the posh downtown Scottsdale hotel. Nick Lachey was touching distance and Matt Leinart nearly ran me over with his drunken breast stroke.  The pool is where the party is on the weekends. It's filled with the beautiful crowd, many who live in the Valley.  I recommend getting a group of friend's together and splitting the $100 local rate between four people so you can enjoy the fun pool scene -- you can't use the pool unless you're staying there or you're with a guest who's staying there. Plus you never know, Matt Leinart may very well run you over next!

Although I stopped buying CDs a long time ago thanks to iTunes, I will always think of Zia in a fond way. I spent most of my college years purusing the aisles after class looking for hard-to-find classic records, box sets and new albums that I simply must have. I love the variety of the store and I'm always amazed at how knowledgable the staff is. They will talk to you for hours on end about  music. And the store is great for selling your old CDs when you want to make some extra money for that next road trip or for books for next semester or for some drinking money for the weekend even!

Bungalow doesn't serve up just simply bar food (wings, burgers, etc.). The quaint downtown Scottsdale restaurant and bar, which is more of a bar scene after 8 p.m., features a large menu with offerings like the cajun seared ahi, filet steak salad and turkey, bacon and guacamole wrap (which I highly recommend).  The bar makes a mean martini and boasts a sweet patio that overlooks Scottsdale Road. It's a good place to kick off a night on the town.

If you're looking for something a little more sophisticated than the Olive Garden (or O.G. as my best friend and I like to call it!), head out to Cafe Boa for the best Italian food Arizona has to offer. The cafe and wine bar has a variety of delcious pastas on the menu ( I love the Tortellini Brigantino). They also offer a variety of martinis (my favorite is the pomegranate martini). And their illuminated patio makes for a romantic setting for those date nights.

Who says there aren't any see-and-be-seen places in Phoenix? Fez is trendy, chic and offers a delicious menu.  The burgers are hearty and packed with flavor and the martinis are mouthwatering. Be sure to try  the Pomegranitini.   The only downside is that with the lightrail construction, it can be somewhat of an obstacle course to get into this place so be sure to check fezoncentral.com for directions.

Thank goodness there's no shortage of Irish pubs in Phoenix. Rosie's is certainly one of the best in the Valley. The bar is warm and inviting.  The staff is friendly. And there's a lot of return customers, giving the bar that "Cheers"-like vibe.  Stella, Smithwick's, Guinness -- you'll find all of the old faves here. So the next time you're looking to get in touch with your Irish side, stop in and say hi. Chances are, you'll see Miss Rosie behind the bar.

I have mixed feelings when it comes to this brewery and restaurant, which has a prime location at Scottsdale Fashion Square. The food is good. I recommend the delicious baked macaroni and cheese and the martinis are excellent. However, the service at the bar is lacking. I've been to Yard House a few times over the last couple of months (I'm usually dragged here because my friends love the place and I  cave in because I don't want to be difficult) and the bartenders -- one guy in particular -- are extremely snooty. The last thing I want when I go into a bar is getting the holier than thou attitude from my bartender and that's all I get when we sit at the bar here. If you want good food and drinks, this is a good place to go, just be sure to sit far, far away from the bar. The wait staff is much more pleasant.

People don't usually come to this downtown Scottsdale night spot to eat. The food isn't anything to call home about and the margaritas aren't spectacular. Infact, the bartenders tend to pour them weak.  However, you will find the party people at the PT. They come to see-and-be-seen. And the bar is SLAMMED with them on Tuesday nights when promoter Brian Durkee hosts Twisted Tuesdays. You'll find guys with popped collars wearing sunglasses at night and peroxide blondes with stiletto heels and cleavage-baring tops. If you're into a scene, this is probably the place for you.

Red Owl, on the southeast corner of Price Road and University Drive, offers two rooms -- the second room is known as Club Red -- where music fans can catch up-and-coming Valley bands as well as national and regional talent.   Local talent such as Shelby James and Violet Wild have performed at the bar along with a local Bon Jovi tribute band who recently packed the place.  The Club Red side is more of a lounge with a sofa, comfy chairs, a pool table and candlelit tables along with a stage. Think Peach Pit After Dark. The Red Owl side is more of a dive bar with cracked peanut shells littering the floor and a small stage for live music.  The bar will probably see it's biggest crowd on Wednesday, Aug. 15 when C.C. DeVille of Poison hosts a Poison afterpary at the venue following the band's show at the Dodge Theatre.

For those wanting to avoid the Starbucks and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf joints of The AZ, head to this locally-owned Tempe find. It's a low-key place to study for your Bio exam or kick back with a good book. And there's a big living room area where throngs of people often congregate for study sessions and lively debates. The iced coffee drinks are delicious and although I haven't tried any of the food options, I've noticed they have a nice breakfast menu.

With thick pieces of feta, a combination of small and large black olives and hearty slices of tomato, the Greek salad at Wildfish was everything I had hoped for and more. It's easy to fill up on the salad alone, but don't.   Bring a small group of friends so you can try a medlee of flavors. I recommend the oysters and the delicious crab cakes. And the sorbet was refreshing, considering we popped in on a hot Wednesday evening. It was the perfect way to top off the meal.

This is my favorite barbecue joint in the Valley. I'm not much of a meat eater, but I can't resist the BBQ at Joe's. I love the pulled pork sandwich. The barbecue sauce is phenomenal and will have you lapping up every last bite. The mac 'n' cheese, which comes with a crusted topping, is to-die-for and makes a wonderful side. The desserts here are also awesome. Be sure to try the rootbeer or the lemon cake.

Sand in a bar in the AZ? While I thought this was too good to be true when the north Scottsdale bar first opened a few years back, I soon found out it wasn't and Sandbar has become one of my favorite Scottsdale bars.   The beach bar features a sand-covered patio, private patio cabanas, an ample margarita menu, delicious Mexican eats and a small pool. The restaurant and bar is decorated with bright decor and the dance floor is a hot spot on the weekends.  Now if only they would add an ocean!

Mardi Gras made the switch from comedy club to full-fledged live music venue last year and has attracted a new crowd with its revamped atmosphere. The dive rock 'n' roll bar, which features a jukebox and attached restaurant (the Voodoo Lounge) is a great place to see live music. The sound system is awesome.   The club is lacking a big following however since they tend to book anyone with a guitar. Some of the bigger shows included national alt-country act Shurman, Scotty Johnson of the Gin Blossoms and Steve Larson of Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers. Sadly there's more bands you probably haven't heard of that play here than well-established acts (like the above mentioned) with a following. Hopefully Mardi Gras will get a clue soon and start booking some better talent.

You're sure to see the hungover Scottsdale crowd that you ran into the night before at US Egg on most weekend days. The restaurant is usually PACKED from 9 a.m. to Noon, but the food is worth the wait. I love the Chalet French Toast and Protein Pancakes. The staff is friendly. And since they give you small glasses filled with soft drinks, they'll usually give you a pitcher so you can refill your own drinks. The Egg, as I like to call it, is also a celebrity hot spot. Barry Bonds, Ice Cube and his wife Coco and Joe Rogan have all stopped in for breakfast at this yummy eatery.

Head to DJs when you want to escape the Scottsdale scene. This non-Scottsdale bar in Scottsdale is waaaay laid back and sits between Mulligan's (formerly Maloney's) and Drinx in the downtown area.   I wouldn't call it a dive bar as Emily pointed out (try The Rogue or Mardi Gras for dives!), but it's certainly a no-frills kind of joint.   Drinks are cheap and the bartenders will even give your FROSTY mugs to enjoy your beer in, which is awesome on the hot summer nights. And even though you're not in a hoppin' club in downtown, you're still sure to see hot guys and gals hanging out here.

Want to see that indie film that's not in the big theatres? Chances are, it'll be screened sooner or later at Harkins Valley Art Theatre. The movie theatre is historic and has been on Mill Avenue for years. I love the funky marquee outside and the old-box office feel. You'll feel like you've been transported into another era.

I love this mini Starbucks! It's right near my pad and it has a drive through that moves fast -- thankfully. And the people who work at this location are characters. Sometimes the baristas will sing to you before they take your order or they'll tell you a joke. This is seriously the wackiest group of people I've ever encountered at a Stabucks, but I love it. And the store manager happens to be the talented singer and keyboardist from hot up-and-coming AZ pop-rock act The Loveblisters.  I highly recommend the White Chocolate Frappachino if you need a jump start in the mornings. The Orange Creme Frap is nice in the afternoons when you need something refreshing in this triple-digit summer heat. And if you're hungry, the lemon loaf is out of this world.

This is a great hotel to stay in if you want to enjoy an intown vaca and basically use the killer pool. It has a funky vibe with retro decor and the rooms are pretty spacious. Plus you're walking distance or a very cheap cab ride away from some of Scottsdale's hottest clubs.  We spent a recent Saturday night here just to spend a leisurely weekend afternoon lying by the pool. Young and beautiful people were kicking back with frozen cocktails and enjoying the outside digs. There's also several cabanas you can rent if you want to throw down some extra money and have a shaded area. You'll be surprised by how many people stay here just to use the pool!

Monkey Pants is a bar that doesn't take itself seriously -- as if its name didn't give that away. The bar hosts live music from local bands, goldfish racing and a 1 a.m. topless shot (free shots for anyone who ditches their shirts!) deal. Sadly for the guys, not a lot of women are eager to part with their clothes and the guys are usually the ones who end up topless by night's end. This wacky spot is fun for a couple drinks, but I couldn't imagine spending an entire evening here. It's usually pretty quiet and uneventful.

It's no wonder that the line is out the door at this Mesa Chipotle every day. The meu is pretty simple: Tacos, Burritos, Burrito Bowl and chips. BUT everything is delicious -- even the quesadilla which you they will make but isn't on the menu.  My favorite is the Burrito Bowl with chicken, rice, pico, medium salsa, sour cream and cheese. The bow is the way to go for the ladies -- those burritos are huge! And the salty tortilla chips here are some of the best I've ever had.

I love this cute, quaint restaurant. You can even catch belly dancing here on the early weekend nights! The food is amazing. Be sure to try the thick hummus and the Shawarma.   Even the drinks are unique. I had one of the best glasses of lemonade (it was extremely fresh tasting and it had a pleasant aroma) and was unlike anything other lemonade I've ever sipped.  There's also a market inside the restaurant where you can pick up a pound of Feta.

I remember a couple years ago when there were four Philly cheesesteak places on Mill Ave. Corleone's drove them all out of business. You can't compete with these guys. And hailing from the city of brotherly love, I like to think I know a thing or two when it comes to the perfect cheesesteak.   I usually order a cheesesteak with mushrooms and whiz (Cheese Whiz). Corleone's packs their cheesesteaks with savory meat and drizzles the steaks with the Whiz, which glistens on the sandwich. For you Philly peeps who like Pat or Geno's, you're sure to like Corleone's.  You can even order a Tasty Kake for dessert.  If you live in the Mill Ave. area, the restaurant delivers.

I'm a big mani/pedi girl and absolutely adore NY Nails. It's reasonably priced (about $28 for a manicure and pedicure) and the staff is friendly. The best part is the massage. Unlike most places, you'll get a good 10 minute massage when you get a pedicure and if you're a working girl -- or even guy who likes to keep his feet clean and isn't afraid of a little touch up from time to time! -- you're sure to enjoy it here.

I've been to the Elephant bar twice and have never had a good experience. While I love the safari ambiance, which reminds me of the Rainforest Cafe in Arizona Mills, the food was lackluster. The restaurant's Web site (elephantbar.com) advertises that 'The menu is unforgettable' but this is far from the truth. My burger was too well done here and on my second trip the Fire Grilled Mahi-Mahi Sandwich didn't sizzle with flavor like I anticipated.  Take the Elephant Bar for what it is -- a fun place to relax with a drink in a unique ambiance. Just skip the food.

The new Harkins Cine Capri, one of the first things to open in Tempe Marketplace, boasts 16 theatres and offers more than the norm when it comes to movie snacks. Moviegoers can order brownie bites, mozzarella sticks and pizza.  The theatre is super spacious and the seats are plush and comfy. And the screen is huge. This is my new favorite movie theatre.

I'm a huge Mexican food fan and Mango's is tops with me! The enchilladas are delicious and the restaurant seriously has the best chips and salsa in the Valley. I'm also a fan of the agua frescas. I recommend the watermelon or mango.

My friends make fun of me for going to this mall, but I loooove it because it's usually dead. Unlike Arizona Mill or the overcrowded Chandler Fashion Center and Scottsdale Fashion Square, I can actually breathe and not have to fight the crowds as I shop. And parking is stress-free since the mall is rarely crowded. It's also filled with fun stores like Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works, Charlotte Russe, Shoelicious and a yummy gelatto stand.

This is one of my favorite stores to hit when I have money burning a hole in my wallet. You'll find brand name items -- many that haven't even been worn and still have the tags -- at this new and used clothing store. I've found some of my best finds here such as a $50 pair of never been work Rock 'N Republic jeans, $65 brand new True Religion jeans and a Juicy Couture studded-denim skirt for $20.

The all-ages music venue is a great place to see a concert in an intimate venue. You can even mingle with the bands! I did shots with the guys from Bowling for Soup last year before their show, next door at the neighboring Horse & Hound. The bad part about the venue is that if you want to drink, you have to stay by the bar to watch the show, and there's not usually a good view. I had to fight to get close last October for the sold-out Jimmy Eat World show.

Last Exit is a great place to see some of Arizona's finest local talent perform. You'll find bands like Violet Wild, Let Go, Source Victoria, Authority Zero and Ghetto Cowgirl rocking out at this super intimate live music venue, which features a small patio with misters. Up-and-coming national acts also grace the stage and you'll see the local music celebrity from time to time such as Robin Wilson of the Gin Blossoms or Roger Clyne of Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers. The beer is very cheap here and the bartenders are awesome.

While there are many Irish pubs in the Valley, Fibber Magee's is by far the best. With its warm wooden walls, cozy booths and friendly staff, I can't help but feel relaxed when I'm sipping on a Black Velvet at my favorite Chandler bar. The bar attracts a lot of regulars. The drinks won't set your wallet back and the food is great! Be sure to try the Bangers 'N' Mash.

When I first started going to Yucca, I was scared by the crowd -- the dive bar attracts a lot of rough locals. However it also attracts a lot of cool music lovin' folks so give it a chance. The bartenders are some of the nicest people I've ever encountered. And I now count the owner Rodney as a friend. The beer is also extremely cheap and the live music kicks ass. I recommend heading out on a Thursday when the bar hosts Rock Karaoke. People are invited to sing along with a backing band (the Valley's Zen Lunatics). You'll hear everyone covering The Doors to The Rolling Stones to The Go Gos. And more often than not, this turns into a show of local musicians performing covers. Watch out for Nate Ruess, the lead singer of Valley pop-rockers The Format. His Beatles covers are killer.

My recent lunch at Del Piero was pretty lackluster. The restaurant, a small eatery inside the Queen Creek Olive Mill, the Valley's first working olive farm and mill, attracted an older crowd (people in their 40s to 60s).We even saw someone wearing  a colorful muumuu,  which served as a loud reminder that we were in the Q.C. and not the O.C.  The options at del Piero are slim -- paninis, sandwiches and salads. There's no soda fountain, but the eatery serves up iced tea, lemonade and the hard-to-find Jones flavored sodas. My panini was blah and didn't wow, but I enjoyed sampling the olive bar. Be sure to try the large olives stuffed with Feta. I could have filled up on these alone! If you're up for a road trip (it took us nearly 40 minutes to get there from Tempe!), Del Piero is open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays. It's  $5-$9 sandwiches, paninis and salads

Hazelwood's boasts 15 flat screen TVs to showcase everything from baseball to extreme fighting to NASCAR to football. The bar is laid back and cozy and offers a nice-sized patio. They have live music and attacts a 20 to 60-something crowd.  This is definitely a neighborhood bar, attracting a friendly crowd. And there's an abundance of beers on tap.

If you're looking for an inexpensive place to get your jeans hemmed, look no further than A.J.'s. I love this place! It's cheap (usually about $12 to alter a hem) and the service is fast. And the people who work there are extremely nice. They've helped me save a handful of expensive jeans that I found in the vintage stores and alter them for my body.

I love, love, love this quaint, bustling sandwich shop, which is located in the strip mall with the Starbucks off Hardy and University. The sandwiches have artsy names such as the Mona, Jazz , Picasso, Van Gogh or Art Deco.   I've tried several of the sandwiches but the best is the Sack's Symphony (Turkey breast, bacon, avocado, tomato, alfalfa  sprouts, cream cheese and mayo on 12 grain bread). Every sandwich comes in a cute, boxed lunch with a cookie.

There's really something for everyone at this Tempe kosher-style deli, which attracts a lot of ASU students and families due to its close proximity to campus You can get crepes, lox and cream cheese and herring along with pancakes, grilled cheese, a BLT or meatloaf. The choices seem endless and the menu is almost intimidating. And the prices? Cheap!

Hair products, makeup and fragrances, oh my! As a woman, it's hard not to get caught up in the beauty-licious fun that is Ulta. It's a one-stop shop for women and is my favorite place to get the bigger name hair products at a discounted price (compared to the salons!).    Redken, Bed Head, Frederic Fekkai -- practically all the names are here. And there's also a salon if you want to stop in for some new highlights and/or a trim.   The store also offers an Ulta card where if you shop as much as I do, you can earn rewards and save money on future visits.

Gilbert's Brunswick Zone XL bowling center is unlike any bowling alley in Arizona and is too cool for G-Town. The new 58,000-square-foot venue features 44 bowling lanes -- one side, with chairs and tables, for league bowlers and the other, with plush couches, for open bowlers -- along with an interactive game room and a lounge and restaurant. The wait staff will even bring cocktails to your lane!  There's also a Gameworks-style arcade with 88 interactive video games such as Deal or No Deal, air hockey, Skee-Ball and Doc's Interactive Shootout. And the cafe offers a variety of food from three kids of soup to pastas to even a Philly cheesesteak.

Ladies if you're looking for a sugar daddy, you're bound to find him at this Scottsdale steakhouse. While there's no denying that the steaks are tops. I'm more of a fan of the bar atmosphere.   My friend and I cruised into the see-and-be-seen restaurant for a drink recently and within in a matter of minutes, we were approached by a group of  sharply-dressed guys in their late 40s. We politely declined their invitation for dinner and drinks, but their next target group -- three buxom blondes who appeared to be in their early 20s -- took them up on the offer.   If you're planning to come for simply cocktails, be sure to bring some extra cash because drinks are pricey. And if you order a martini, try the fruity flirtini, it's my favorite.

Long day at work? Family coming to town? Need some drinks to put a break up out of your mind? Head to Z Tejas and order a Chambord margarita stat!!! The refreshing, frozen treats are so potent that the restaurant and bar will limit you to three. And while you may think you're not feeling more than a case of brain freeze after your first one, you're sure to feel the effect soon enough.   If you're with a big group be sure to grab a booth or a patio seat at this cool Scottsdale Fashion Square nightspot. The patio is a fun place to people watch and take in the fancy rides that people valet. If you're inside with a couple of friends, grab a seat at the bar and say hello to Jerrod Sands. He's one of the best bartenders in Scottsdale. But don't hate on him when he cuts you off after that third Chambord margarita. You're probably slurring by now and he has your best interest in mind after all.
