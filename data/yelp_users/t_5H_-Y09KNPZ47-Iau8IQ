I've been eating here since I first moved to the area in 1996. I absolutely LOVE this place. The roasted duck, Hong Kong style chow mein, the salty pepper pork and salty pepper squid. It just doesn't get any better. They give you a very authentic and home-made feeling with their culinary creations. High recommend.

I brought my mother here for Mother's Day. The place was packed! They didn't look like it, but the staff was prepared. We were seated within a few minutes. The service was great and the food was excellent. My mother had the breakfast burrito, massive. My brother the crab cakes Benedict, looked outstanding. And I the country fried steak biscuit & gravy, I ate nothing else the rest of the day. Fantastic restaurant, large meals around $10, definitely recommend.

Wow. I absolutely love this place. My dad and I have been eating here longer than I can remember. The service is as great as the cuisine. My 2 personal favorites are the charbroiled lemon grass curry chicken, and the beef ball and brisket soup. But the shareable classics for us will always be the house special chicken, the salty pepper squid, and an order of egg fried rice.

Came here on my lunch break for a simple $5 meal. I waited in the drive thru for no less than 20 minutes. The last five minutes of waiting took place AFTER I had finally paid. TOO SLOW!!! You would think in all that time I would get my meal the way I asked, without lettuce. But they actually went and put extra lettuce. So rediculous. Never had problems at this Fili B's before until today. Not going back.

Good food, the best eats! Get the chicken tenders!!! Their brews a nothing short of amazing, and the service is excellent. Very clean restaurant area. Parking's a pain, but once you're in, you're gold!

The food takes SUPER long to be served. Kinda disappointing and makes me wonder if they do it on purpose to fulfill the waitress's $3/hour.  On the other hand, their service is pretty good.  I'm pretty hungry, still waiting for my food.

This place is as good as it gets. Authentic Hong Kong style cuisine. Friendly and caring service, and a nice, quiet atmosphere that let's you know you've just left the desert behind for something amazing. Been eating here since 1998, and never gonna stop!

I'm a straight guy so you can imagine I don't get my nails done too often. But I had some guests at the hotel that wanted to go. Reservations recommended Mirage. I drove them there and they said I HAD to join them and get a pedicure. They said they would even pay for it. I was skeptical, and also on the clock. But I took a risk and laid down. Best bad decision I ever made. The massage was on point. Each chair had a little foot bath with warm water. The whole joint is decorated with water and dolphins. 2 huge flat screens. This place was COMFORTABLE! I even warned them about my in-grown toe nail. Not only did my nail tech take care with my painful spot, she completely removed the in-grown! I didn't know they could do that! I can walk normal again! This place is awesome. Definite recommendation. 10/10 stars, class A rating, friendly personal staff with a cool atmosphere!

A year ago I posted a nasty review of this place. The general consensus for my friends and I was that it was a place with amazing food and horrible service. But things have surely changed. Asian cafe has provided outstanding service and hasn't changed their dining at all. This place deserves 5 stars. I highly recommend to anyone and everyone.  EAT AT A.C.E.!

Authentic Chinese cuisine AND atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and honest. They took great care of us! The food was not only delicious, it was presentable. The egg rolls were sliced and fashioned criss-cross, the general tso's shrimp laid above a bed of broccoli, and the wonton soup was filled so high we couldn't finish it. This place is 6/5 stars.

This place is absolutely fantastic. The food is amazing, and the customer service is just as great. Good music, very nice dining room. And they have ice cream! It really doesn't get better than this because the crew at Mike's Burgers and Cheesesteaks knows what they're doing. I got the Cheesesteak with mushrooms and jalape√±os, I highly recommend it. Also, burgers are Buy One Get One free on Tuesday. Come check this place out.

Very few times have I taken my car to a shop to get exactly the repairs needed to keep it running strong. These guys are awesome and have taken great care of my 240SX and Prelude over the past couple years. Very friendly and caring, and excellent on pricing. They even offer a discount if your car is an import! I recommend this place to everyone for car care. From simple repairs to extraneous labor, they will definitely have you covered.

The restaurant was nice looking and very clean. The cashier was quite polite. When she brought me the mail that I ordered, I opened it just to make sure that it was correct. I ordered the Grapow which is a stirfried ground pork in mixed chopped chilies. Very spicy, the way I like it. But I called on the phone just to make sure that it was only the chopped chilies and nothing else, And they said that the Grapow also comes with onions and other vegetables. When I checked the food to see if it was just ground pork and chopped chilies, I had to have them remake it. When I finally got it again it was made correctly, but there was maybe 3 ounces of ground pork in this big square to go box. I don't know if you guys know how much 3 ounces of ground pork looks like, but just imagine maybe to gulps of water and you're done. I paid $10 for this. I don't recommend this place to anyone. Great atmosphere, great service, pathetic food. Two stars.

Second time here and I've gotta say... Scottsdale can't be beat. This Gilbert customer service was NOT on point. The counter people weren't friendly, and our host was trying to act smart with me. I made eye contact, smiled, and nodded to maybe 3 or 4 different hosts that didn't acknowledge me back. Then the security guard came and bothered us when we weren't even doing anything wrong. I didn't come here with my 14 year old brother and disabled father to be harassed by some rent a cop. I think he yelled at us because we were the only people there that weren't white.   The food was ok.

I'm not big on nightlife, but I had an awesome time at Urbane Manner. Came through here with Scottsdale Nights. What a total blast! DJ NIGHTMARE was off the hook. I love the spacious design and how the A/C is non-stop blasting. I brought a sweat rag and only used it once at the end of the night. The best part of my experience though was Alicia. She always made sure I was smiling and that I had a drink in my hand. I'm certified in customer satisfaction and Alicia has VERY excellent customer service in my book, big thank you to her. Big thanks to Scottsdale Nights for bringing us all out here. This place is great and on a roll, 5 Stars.
