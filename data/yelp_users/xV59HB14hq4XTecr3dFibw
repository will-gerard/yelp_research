I'm partial to the Sweet Tomatoes / Souplantation franchise having been an employee for Garden Fresh throughout high school. However, I have remained a loyal patron over the years because unlike other buffets, the options are always fresh and plentiful.  I understand why Sweet Tomatoes gets some negative reviews. Its prepared salads and pastas are generally just OK. But, what I personally love about this place is that you get the chance to be creative with what you eat.  If you're like me and you enjoy piling your plate with dozens of types of fresh veggies to make that perfect-tasting salad, you'll love this place. Doctor up the rosemary potato soup with some jalapenos or red peppers and you have a complete meal.  Its all about the salad bar -- you wont find a better one anywhere in Phoenix, at least I haven't. Whole Foods is about the only one that compares even in the slightest, in my opinion.  Not all the prepared dishes are mediocre... in fact, a few have me rushing for Sweet Tomatoes whenever I hear they'll be served. Try the tuna tarragon, lemon cream pasta with capers and the vegetarian black bean chili. Mmm Mmm Mmm...

I first found E's Urban Hair, and Pablo, in 2008 when I chopped all my hair off. I loved it.  I had been getting my hair cut there on and off until Pablo moved and I was at a loss. Conveniently, I was also ready for a trim and color. They paired me with their new stylist, and veteran colorist, Shawn.  I have never been dissatisfied. Contrary, Shawn works magic with hair dye. I've tried to box dye my hair several times and could never get the color to look quite right or to keep its vibrancy for long.  The only downside is that each trip puts a huge dent in my wallet. But, it's completely worth the price--Shawn does it right too so I only have to go back for touch ups every 3 months or so. And, he trims my bangs for free.  I don't really know what else you could want in a salon. Friendly, energetic ARTISTS and a fun, funky space... getting pampered there is truly an experience, a treat.

A few things have stopped me from going vegan in my life and dining out options is one of them. Another is parting with food items I'd miss dearly. I don't eat meat and I hadn't really found any vegetarian restaurant that did fake meat well, until I went to The Loving Hut.  It seems like every time we go there our eyes widen and we're asking, "how the hell did they do that?"  Last night, they made yams taste like shrimp--not just taste like it, but have the same texture. WTF!?  Though this restaurant isn't quite as good as Green, (I'm biased toward American-style food anyway), its food is unique, tasty, and inexpensive.  If you're not a vegan, you may feel bombarded with propaganda upon entrance; fair warning.

I had never been to this salon before but was going to be shopping last Saturday and decided to give it a try. I wanted to get about 8-10 inches of hair cut off and a color, so I called ahead and set up an appointment. When I called, I was told my haircut would be between $25-35 and the color would start at $65.   I was paired with a stylist named Mark. He seemed nice enough at first but quickly, as I tried to engage in conversation about what I wanted done to my hair, I felt he was becoming less and less engaged. He shampooed me first and did the cut. It was a little too blunt for my liking but before I had a chance to talk to him about it, he said he'd "be right back" as he had to finish up another client.  I sat there for 30 minutes with wet hair drying in odd directions and wondered when he'd be doing my color. He finally returned and said he didn't think I really needed color because I still had some on my hair from a few months ago when I had colored it. I explained to him I wanted to go lighter and wasn't happy with the current color, which had grown out pretty significantly.  So he took me to another chair where he began blow-drying my hair. When he finished I couldn't believe it. I had asked for a short, choppy cut with bangs and he instead made my hair look like a 50's housewife with a flip. It really wasn't me but I decided not to make a big deal about it and that I could fix the cut and style by myself at home. I was wondering when he was going to do the color but he just said "done!"  I looked at him confused and he said-- "you don't feel cheated I didn't do color on you, do you?"  I was a little flabbergasted. I had asked repeatedly and even made an appointment to get highlights. By this time though, I was just annoyed and wanted to get home so I could fix my hair. So I just said "well, I would like it lighter, but oh well."  To top it all off, Mark charged me $48 for the cut, which was $13 over the highest price I was quoted on the phone for just a cut. He was shaking when completing my transaction, and was about to lose it. I don't really know why, I hadn't overreacted or been rude in any way, just expressed disappointment. Then, to my surprise, he unexpectedly yelled out behind him, "CAN SOMEONE HELP ME OUT OVER HERE? I'M HAVING A MENTAL BREAKDOWN!"  I think it's safe to say I won't be returning to Regis salon. I'm sure some of the other stylists there are receptive and treat their customers with respect, but the experience I had was sad and disappointing, especially for making such a drastic change to my appearance.  Maybe Mark was having a bad day. Either way, I wish him well in the future and hope that my kindness in giving him a decent tip shows that I have respect, even if he doesn't.

I feel like the biggest hipster ever for writing this review but I don't really care right now. Bikini is one of my favorite bars in downtown... When I'm poor, I know I can run in and get a $5 mini pitcher of Pabst and be happy.  I'm not sure what is up with the pool table and sometimes I wish they'd just remove it during peak hours on Friday and Saturday nights. Pants off dance off is SO much more fun, anyway :]  Oh, and the bathrooms kinda suck, but I forgive you, Bikini. You are a dive, after all.

Thai skeptics and Thai lovers unite! Malee's hits the mark with classic Thai flavors punched up in artful, unique dishes. It is consistently one of my favorite restaurants in the Old Town area, and is reasonably priced for the quality to boot!   I love spice, and the Thai Fai Fire Wraps (crispy chicken lettuce wraps spiced to your request) are as satisfying as they are fun to eat. As another appetizer, you can't go wrong with a pot of Tom Yum, the perfect blend of tangy and hot soup with generous helpings of mushroom and chicken.  For an entree, I almost always order the Arizona Heatwave which is a vegetarian red curry delight with veggies cooked to perfection in a savory, creamy sauce. The Pad Thai noodles are another favorite -- and I appreciate that the crushed peanut sauce comes on the side, so you can add as much as you want.  Whatever you do, GET THE FRIED RICE!!! (more specifically, Deirdre's Favorite Jalapeno Fried Rice). Quite possibly one of the most simple, yet delicious things I have ever tasted. The dish includes flavorful fried rice mixed with crisp jalapenos and Chinese sausage which is to-die-for.  No bad words about Malee's. I go home happy every time.

I love spicy foods but they are not kidding when they write CAUTION all over the menu next to the habanero burger. It is absolutely ridiculous. My boyfriend has a really high tolerance for spice and he could even eat the whole thing... but a day later he called me and said he wouldn't be ordering it again because digesting it was painful.... hahaha. I could only eat half of the habanero burger the first time I went so the second time, I just got a regular burger with bleu cheese. Was delicious though... can't wait to go back and try some other things on the menu.  Happy hour prices are great!

Don't be an hour late on your payment, they will drop you from the class. When you call to get back into classes, it's a lengthy process, one that can cause you to miss assignments and fall behind.  I have never had a good experience with Rio Salado. If you're going to offer mostly online classes, you better be pretty damn available to the students if something goes haywire.  I really only took classes here to transfer them to ASU. I keep hearing horror stories about Rio Salado losing people's transcripts and it doesn't surprise me in the slightest.  Each department seems to be disconnected from the others. If you do have a problem, prepare to spend at least an hour on the phone between waiting on hold and being transferred (all to, usually, leave a message).  If you can, pick another place to get your education.

This is my first stop when I need to buy some new jeans or want a cute outfit to go out in... I never know what I'm going to come across on the racks. I always find myself entering the dressing room with more than the allowed amount of items.  I'm a bargain hunter and a vintage clothing lover, so naturally, I enjoy shopping at used clothing stores. Buffalo is way better than a thrift store though (for buyers). They only accept items from sellers that are in good condition and in style.  That being said, it's not a great place to sell your clothes. I've taken in two trash bags full of nice, gently-worn name-brand clothing only to have a few items taken.  The prices vary. Usually, I can find some amazing deals. I got this awesome black military-style vest for $8 the other day that was a super-steal. Other times, I'm like.... "I'm not paying $20 for that used t-shirt."  I was also looking for a cute jean vest FOREVER... and finally realized the mannequin in the window was wearing one that was exactly the style I wanted. They took it off her and sold it to me right there for $10.  Some of my other favorite finds were a vintage jean jacket for $12, leather mini skirt for $14, skinny black jeans that fit perfect for $15, and wooden lion-shaped earrings for $4.

This place is a gem hidden among the crappy, overcrowded bars on Mill. Though there is a small cover to get in, you usually get in free if you are a student. They have other specials that go on as well.  I love the music. I'm a huge oldies fan and the mix of 70s-90s the talented Big Bang band plays just really gets me in a great mood. My boyfriend took me on a date here this past weekend after I had a crummy week and my spirits were lifted by the time we left. I couldn't stop singing along the entire night.  The only two things that have bothered me when I've stumbled down into this piano bar are:  1) Do they really play your requests? I, for one, have never had my request played, even if I've tipped. I am wondering if the band just plays only a few of the requested songs and the rest, songs they already know. 2) Drinks are a little pricey, but what isn't on Mill?  Love Big Bang and I'll be going here for years to come. Also, I can' t wait to take my parents! They'd have a blast.

Okay, okay this review was coming. This is my coffee shop.  Yeah, I'm that girl, you know, "medium iced coffee with soy?"  They've got some new people on staff, but so far they all seem awesome. This is my favorite neighborhood coffee shop. It has everything you could want from a local cafe without the self-righteous hipster attitude. (cough, Cartel, cough). Besides the quality of the drinks and food, the atmosphere is nice. They have free WiFi.  What I love most about Fair Trade is supporting the business. I have (newly-formed) friends who work there and love it. The management truly treats its staff great and really wants to cater to the downtown Phoenix community. The prices are good and comparable to any Starbucks, but the coffee is traded ethically and bought for a fair price, which makes me happy.  Psst... they also have poetry readings and open-mic nights.  The only thing I dislike is that Fair Trade started closing earlier :( I can't go there anymore when I need to pull an all-nighter.  Try it and love it.

Their prices are incredible. My boyfriend and I shared the chicken wings and Greek salad... both were delicious. I got a glass of wine as well and our total bill was about $20. The wings are grilled after they're tossed so they're less messy but the flavor has soaked in. So good.   This place was packed on a Friday night but we were able to get a table right away. If you go at peak hours you may expect to wait a little bit for a seat, and don't be in a hurry to get your food. They had one server for the whole place when I was there. But, I knew this going in and wasn't in a hurry, so it really didn't bug me that much.  I've heard they have live music here too. I'm new to the neighborhood so I'll definitely be back!

I've lived here for a year and I'm staying in the complex because it beats all my other options.  Roosevelt Square definitely has its downsides--utilities were a lot more than I expected, especially in the summer. Be careful when choosing an apartment, especially if there are a lot of floor to ceiling windows. It's also a little pricier than other apartment complexes in the area, but time is money; with a gym, Pita Jungle, two local coffee shops, and the light rail within a hop, skip, and a jump away, it's completely worth it. I was disappointed with the pool--it's always cold and there is no jacuzzi. I never use it.  Those things being said, it's easy to feel unsafe in downtown. Roosevelt Square is one of the few apartments that I can say I have always felt safe in. There is a decent amount of security and the Phoenix police have a station in one of the buildings. The condos, church, and surrounding area make it nice and secure-feeling, and hey, it's all about confidence right?  Any time something has broken, the management has been pretty good about getting someone up to fix it within a couple of days. Not many complaints there.  I live in the "B" building which is definitely the quietest from what I've heard. I'm a college student but I heard most of them live in the "C" wing, while the "A" wing is near the light rail and public parking (popular among downtown Phoenix bar-goers).  The location is AMAZING. I can't imagine picking a better one. I live close to school and close to all my favorite local hot spots. I can bike, walk, or light rail virtually anywhere I want to go. I love that, and like I said, time is money.

Maybe it's my fault for not doing my research before choosing a place to spend New Year's, but my experience last night has guaranteed that American Junkie will not get any more of my business.   Like almost everyone else who showed up early, I assumed their flyer advertising free cover before 11 and a free champagne toast at midnight was legitimate. What I found instead, was that the management lied, (they even admitted it to our faces), and guys were now $20 to get in. (girls would be $10 after 10)  Half our group (mainly the girls) had already gone inside when we discovered that the guys we were with had to go hunt down ATMs, coming back to a line that was poorly-managed and about 2 hours long.   Am I stupid for planning around a NYE flyer? Maybe. I'm new to Scottsdale and apparently not savvy enough to realize that some clubs in Old Town will just flat out lie to their patrons. They know they'll get hordes of rude douchebags knocking down their doors to come inside anyway. WHY?? Why was I even there and why did I give them my business? Never again.  Oh, and the inside was packed like sardines. They let in so many people that fights were breaking out left and right, getting a drink was hopeless, and bathroom lines were a half hour long. People were hopping the fence to get in, sick and tired of the line outside. But those in our party who had to wait so long to get in were disappointed anyway.  We stayed till midnight, thinking JUST MAYBE the bar would keep one promise they'd advertised all over their website, and pass out flutes of champagne. Nope.  This would have never happened in Downtown Phoenix. I know it's just a bar, but honestly people, we need to hold places accountable for deception. My friends and I planned a night out that got ruined... and half our party left, fed up with the situation.  Don't go to American Junkie... it is just that, junk.

This is my favorite neighborhood spot after moving into the midtown area of Phoenix just a couple months ago. It's quickly becoming a weekly hangout, especially since Monday boasts $2.50 drafts all night. The rotating tap currently is the Peach Ale from Four Peaks which is a personal favorite, so I've found myself walking on over to Main Ingredient more often.  Everything on the menu I have tried has been scrumptious including, but not limited to their award-winning and decked-out hot dog, Jive Turkey sandwich and Baby Bleu salad, which goes amazing with the Peach Ale, just sayin'. Also, the turkey used here is roasted in-house.  The other amazing thing about Main Ingredient is that they are pet-friendly. Bring your pups along and the friendly staff will put out a water bowl and make sure they're happy. My roommate's little Ruby Rue loves to lounge in the evening warmth as we throw back a couple beers, especially since she gets lots of love from friendly neighbors and staff.

I love Urban Outfitters, but this is probably the worst one I've been to.  I get that it's new and that there isn't a lot of business, but for the love of God... there needs to be a sales section.  Urban, for me, has always been the place where I go to buy nice clothing for special occasions, or to hit the sales racks when I am feeling like some new tops or dresses. I rarely ever will pay full price for anything there.  Honestly, most of their clothing is cute, but all of it is overpriced at full retail. And considering the City Scape's location has nearly nothing discounted, I have ceased to shop there.  Downtown Phoenix is growing, and that's awesome--but they wonder why the higher-end businesses don't do as well. The business and arts district are filled with students and young professionals who don't have a ton of money to spend on clothes.  Also, the staff kind of just gave you blank stares as you walked in. Not the friendliest of shops I've been to.

I was excited when Rice Paper opened in my neighborhood, notably because my boyfriend and I are huge Pho fans. This quaint little eatery did not disappoint on its most-popular dish. The beef broth was flavorful, the side veggies crisp and the thin slices of beef melt in your mouth.  The Pho here is a bit more pricey than other Vietnamese places I've been to in Tempe or throughout the Valley, however, the quality makes it worth it. A couple could easily share one order of Pho and some spring rolls and be satisfied.  Where my disappointment set in was with the curry tofu dish. I realize the Vietnamese aren't known for curry, but I was expecting a bit more based on the delicious-tasting spring roll I had just enjoyed. The tofu was dry and the curry lacked depth, overpowered by spices.  Service gets an A-. Waiter was great, but a bit pushy on menu items.

Any restaurant that offers gluten-free options automatically gets a boost in my book...and their GF pancakes are delicious! They taste very similar to buttermilk pancakes. I had been craving pancakes for so long but am allergic to wheat, so when my friend told me about this place, I was so excited.  Haven't tried the gluten-free Belgian waffles yet but that's next on my list.  When the weather is nice, it can be a 45 minute wait for first-available seating on Sundays (that's when my boyfriend and I go), but they do offer a coffee and juice bar while you wait.   I just wish they transformed more of their options to gluten-free.. I've been dying for some Eggs Benedict... Butters, please get some gluten-free English muffins so I can order some! :D

I cannot speak for the food, (though the menu looked unique and tantalizing), but the beer selection was great, as was service. We arrived on Saturday night, the first weekend Angels Trumpet was open, around 10 p.m. for drinks. There was a large group of us, 9 people... though there weren't any tables to accomodate our party we were able to stand/be seated comfortably around one of the high-tops.  This place is great for smaller parties who enjoy a good beer. The selection cannot be beat in downtown Phoenix -- 31 craft brews on tap of every taste and style... and they're always rotating. I had the Biere Blonde & White... 4.5% alcohol, light, sunny taste. Reminded me of Four Peak's SunBrew.  The selection ranges from hoppy IPAs at 10% alcohol/volume to the lighter, summer brews and everything in between. There is literally something for everyone, even a few wines on tap for the non-beer drinkers.  Our server was very nice and accommodating.. and though the place was packed she got us our drinks pretty quickly.  A couple reasons I didn't give Angels Trumpet the perfect '5' star rating:  Disorganization-- Seating was sort of a nightmare... and we kind of waited around for one of the high-tops to open up and just snagged it. Ambience-- I enjoyed the nice, open floor plan but the restaurant-style and dozens of tables/chairs was a bit puzzling considering the kitchen was closed when we arrived. I couldn't hear any music above the conversations in the room and the huge, 60" TV screens weren't turned on. It'd be nice for weekend nights to boast something a little more special. If you're going to close the kitchen, allow people to walk around and mingle more.  Overall, if you're looking for a nice place to kick back with a small group of friends and try some awesome, unique beers on tap, Angels Trumpet is it. Their prices are reasonable for the quality offered. Haven't tried the food, but the menu is pretty diverse offering a spin on traditional bar food like flatbread pizzas and sandwiches.
