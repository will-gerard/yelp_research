Really bad experience today. I ordered this chocolate coated strawberries 45 count and I end up getting this 32 tiny strawberries and 13 bigger strawberries costing me $ 2.49 each. They never displayed the strawberries upon delivery and I feel cheated and frustrated.

Thanks to my friend Damian Motlo who introduced me to this wonderful cross fit strength family . The staff and the owner Gayle personally take care of member to member interaction and not let newbie like me get intimidated by cross fit workout . All the coaches are wonderful and patient with beginners and focus more on technique and posture which is very helpful for beginners. I am just two week old and looking forward to be full time member and part of this wonderful fitness family !!

It's one of my favorite place to chill either for drinks or food. Big fan of Jackson and Kevin. Very down to earth and friendly . All the staff and management is very accommodating and friendly. I am always planning my friends get together either for drinks , brunch or dinner. You can never go wrong with food. 4 street tacos and mac and cheese balls my favorite.

As much I want to rate this place with 5 stars , I have to rate 2 as this Sunday ( feb 15) I went with my friend for his bday lunch and was very disappointed with service of lunch buffet at 1 pm . Pretty much every tray of food was empty , masala dosa was replaced by not well prepared uthapam , gulab jamuns were extremely soggy and mashed in syrup , payasam was burn and coconut chutney was way diluted ( as if they were running out of it ) . Overall it was really bad. Still giving 2 star as I have some wonderful experience with buffet here and also dinner. Some of the preparations were good but the vada were very tough and idly"s were not sour enough, overall it was very bad buffet  for $13 and I drove all the way from central phoenix to enjoy this food. Disappointment !!!

So I have been trying to write review for a long time as been fez fan since 2010 till 2014 last year !! This year jan 2 nd had this horrible dinner experience and on top of that an ugly online facebook  drama  triggered by the owner "Tom Jetland " in response to one yelp review which he was bashing on Facebook. Anyway I love the staff there but that night experience and his attitude and his blame game on customer was all time low !! Never ever going there again. Boycotting all his restaurants !! Food is definitely good there and so are drinks but this experience will be all time ugly experience for us .

Very good place for sea food in phoenix. This city has been lacking on sea food front and this place did good job with selection of menu along with quality of food and service. Though we had a waiting of 30 minutes , staff was attentive and very endearing with their attitude !! Definitely coming back for good time with friends
