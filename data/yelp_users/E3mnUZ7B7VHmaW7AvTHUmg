Excellent quality at a very reasonable price. Freshest salmon I've had in a long time. Will definitely be coming back and would happily be a regular if I lived closer.

(June 2010) Going downhill. I used to give this place 4 stars, maybe 4.5, but my past two experiences have NOT been up to par and I really feel that Ebisu may be going downhill. They no longer serve the honey mustard with the coconut shrimp, which is 50% of the reason why I ordered the shrimp! It was sooo good! The waitress who has been there "2 years" tried to tell me it is "because of the customers." What does that mean anyway? You are trying to displease the customers or the customers don't like it? I certainly can not imagine the latter. Furthermore, three of the beers on their happy hour menu were either no longer being carried or were out of stock. The waitress tried offering my friend and "IBA" from Flagstaff. :-/  I found the waitress's attitude off-putting. She never apologized for not having about 1/2 of the items we ordered and just took this unapologetic "we are doing it for the customers" approach ---- forgive my ignorance, but am I NOT a customer?  Finally, during my past 2-3 visits, the fish has not been of the best standard... Not as fresh as it should be/has been. In fact, my salmon was getting this darker, rubbery-ish edge from too much air exposure... :-/ Overall, this place used to rock my socks - I was glad to have discovered them, having just been taken over by new management... I thought all the "changes" would have occurred by now, but I guess I was wrong.... Ebisu, step up to the plate and start giving your customers (you know, the people who pay your wages??) what we WANT.

The pizza dough is made by scratch and is local, thanks to MJ Bakery. It has the perfect crunch/doughy ratio and is light yet flavorful.   The Meatball pizza is delicious and definitely one that I can't seem to stop ordering. The meatballs are sliced thinly and are reminiscent of meatloaf -- rich, hearty and well seasoned. I personally like to add ricotta, just my thing. Though beware, it tends to make the crust slightly soggy (I don't mind).  If you're in the mood to make a mess, order the grilled artichoke, I swear it's worth the price.  So happy that I can walk here from my house.  The servers are super friendly and not too pretentiously hipster.  I do with they served cocktails...
