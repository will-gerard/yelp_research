I love thai basil. esepcially this location.  Great for lunch, service is great, its always packed so maybe avoid the lunch rush?  Lunch special comes w. soup, spring roll, fruit desert and the meal. Great price and food is always fresh.  Also their purple rice and mango desert is awesome!

Sooo, I made reservation this monday at Nobu, with high expectation and hope... I was expecting excellent quality fish from the price they were charging.  I went to Vegas to eat here... I was expecting to spend alot of money too.   However... when i walked in, the resturant looks nice and hipp, was pretty busy for a monday night. We made reservation but they tried to sit us in same booth right next to another customer so we decided to sit at sushi bar.   Server was super friendly, knew his menu well, sushi chiefs were all Japanese and friendly/helpful as well.  I ordered one of recommendation from the server, and Toro Tara to start with, still excited!  I got bit suspicious when toro tartar came from kitchen, instead of sushi bar, it looked amazing with ice, caviar, lil bamboo shoot garnish and side of Yama-momo japanese plum.  When I see the actual Toro... I was more suspicious because of the color of the fish... it just didn't look like toro to me at all... I took a bite hoping to hop with joy, instead i had to look at my dish again... to make sure it was BLUE FIN TORO TARTAR.... I swear, its a scam, i had blue fin toro and good toro many times in my life time, but it is not a blue fin toro! It tasted like regular crappy tuna grinded up like a baby food.  argh... you don't understand the disappointment... coming all the way from phx to eat at THE NOBU... and this is what i get. =/   I had Uni sashimi, which was not that fresh, not so bad but for the price they charge, it should been better, Negi-toro was decent, it was real toro at least, not Tartar baby food crap.  King crab ceviche was just too sour... killed the flavor... after that, i didn't want to try anything else, but i had kabocha desert... which just tasted like normal pumpkin cake instead of japanese kabocha...   presentation was well done, its really beautiful, sushi chiefts are nice, and so are staff there but  food...   just dose not match the price of reputation. come on NOBU-san, you can do little bit better than that =/  I wish i ate at yellowtail or Shibuya instead, I will NOT be going back here again...   but plz ppl, don't try the toro tartar its really a scam =/

I love crepe, both real traditional french style and french-wanna-be-japanese style.   Their desert crepe with nutella reminded me of the times i traveled in europe =D  Their regular lunch menu is more americanize? I think   Their crepe is kind of thicker than I'd normally like, but still good.  Still I am soo happy to have a crepe place in az that actually tastes good.   They have good coffee as well, portion is real European style, pretty big. haha, but good quality .  I love this place for lunch.

I am sorry to say, but I went here hoping for REAL english tea house, it truely is not.   Inside is nice, decor, and the cups and plates are kind of fancy, got me really excited.  Waitress was really nice, but she kind of roughly places the tea and dishes which realllly take away from experience.   Food.. I had one of the crepe course, my mother had the most expensive one, my chicken crepe was pretty good, but rest was.....  lets just say, it was my fault for expecting a real tea house in AZ.   their pastires tasted and looked like samples from fry's groceory stores,  they try with their sandwich and stuff, but really it looked so crappy and tasted like regular teenage-made sandwich, nothing as fancy as their menu make it sound.   For the price they charge, i think they have to try little bit harder... but i think they do good with older customers who lived in az all their life, but can't fool ppl that actually traveled across the country =/

Simply Japan and Good(^w^)  When I walked in, I was instantly happy because how much it reminded me of small Japanese ramen shop in Osaka.   They play Japanese music from 70's to present, which adds good touch to the resutrant.  I ordered tonkotsu ramen, their broth is excellent, rich creamy and yummy =D Their noodle is straight skinny type, which is good match for tonkotsu broth.   I had their Gyoza, witch is homemade and delicious.   Their chashu tastes like real chashu you can get in Japan (^w^) mmmMM I would definitely go back their when i goto Vegas next time =D

I always wanted to try Nobuo's, and I finallly had the chance to check it out.  The place is sooo cute, the teeter house really gives you comfortable feeling as soon as you walk inside, you can really relax... great place to grub drinks all night and hang out with your date =D  I had their Tako Age, which reminded me of TAKOYAKI, japanese octupus ball treat deep fried, which was quit interesting, the yuzu mayo sauce went really well with it.   Their Oyster/Uni dish is amaaazing. I never thought tomatoe would match so well with uni!! it was also one of the  freshest I had in town =D   Their okonomiyaki really made me home sick , it really dose taste like a real thing in osaka =D  waitress was friendly, and she knew her menu,  olong tea i had was yummy too, and they have great selection of wine and sake.   Food is small portion,and it dose take a lil time to come out, but i can taste the delicate art in each dish, which to me is totally worth it. If you love food and respect art of food, you have to try this place =D  I am going back next time for his Omakase... mMmmmm Over all, I'm glad phx has at least one place thats not like other resutrants, I love this place
