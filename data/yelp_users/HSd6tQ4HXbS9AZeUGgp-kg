Five stars for the Employees one star for the owner. I'm not a regular but I have been going there occasionally since 1996 when it was the Lazy Q. The beer selection is great but I would steer clear if you enjoy music that would be considered extreme. The jukebox had tons of "clean" music on it and had many bands excluded from the data base. Really? I applaud the owner for editing music he doesn't like. His excuse was people left the pool hall because patrons would play "Death metal or Gansta Rap " incessantly. It's a bar, not a family resturant. It's too bad the owner is regulating morality like our Government. I vote with my dollars. I'll be going elsewhere for some beers after work. It's too bad because his great employees are losing tips and the owner looses the cut he gets on the jukebox.

I went on a Saturday night. It was packed and not looking like a good time was to be had. The only reason I even went was for a Birthday party. I am a biker with no club affiliation and had on carpenter jeans , boots and a motorcycle t shirt. I was told by the little bitch bouncer/fluffer at the door my pants where too baggy??? Really??? I'm actually happy I didn't get in to an over priced dive bar in a high rent zip code. Do yourselves a favor and stay away. Unless you want to hang out with a bunch of suckers that think Scottsdale is so cool.
