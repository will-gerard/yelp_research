I came here to get a PO box. I admit I was a little scared after reading the reviews, but thought I'd at least give it a try since it is in the most convenient location for me. I was pleasantly surprised with fantastic customer service.   I mentioned the bad reviews and was told the person responsible for those awful reviews no longer works there. I hope this location can get their stars back up because they deserve more than 2 for sure!!

My husband and I have ordered take out from this place several times and everything we got was amazing!!!! I especially recommend their breakfast (only until 11:30 on weekdays, sadly), and the chicken with apricot glaze! I don't know how they get the chicken so tender, it might be the best I've ever had.

Lovely outdoor mall. There are water misters all over the place, keeping shoppers cool. Lots of fancy stores and nice restaurants with beautiful and delicious smelling foods that I can't eat. I really enjoyed walking around and looking at the pretty things.

I was very excited today when I walked into this lululemon and found WHITE pants. Apparently this is what they do in the Summer. I'm usually only looking for pants in the Winter, so I had never seen this before. YAY WHITE!  This is the only lululemon I have ever been to that has its own restroom. The restroom was nice, and the sign on the door is hilarious, but the smell inside was seriously overpowering. I think an air freshener factory exploded inside. My lungs felt compromised. *cough*  The staff were friendly and helpful and the store was very clean and tidy.

If you want your dishes washed by this company, you have to specifically request it in advance in addition to ordering a basic cleaning. Dish washing is not an automatic service, which is extremely odd since this has been an automatic service with every other cleaning company I have ever used. When the cleaning professional left today without washing our dishes, I was baffled. How do you clean a kitchen and leave dirty dishes in the sink?? If you are going to exclude a service that every other company offers automatically, you should probably make sure the customer understands this. Like really make sure! Mention it on the phone! Put it on your new client form! Seriously guys! Fail!

They did a great job and were very pleasant and friendly. They were able to take me right away, and the price was very reasonable. Best waxing spot ever!  The restroom is fantastic.

Green is vegan junk food. Very fun and delicious, but not incredibly healthy. If you are more health conscious, you can get a bowl of steamed veggies in various sauces from the bowls section of their menu. They do offer an organic tofu option if you are concerned about GMOs. Just ask for the "fresh" tofu. If you are not worried about health, everything here is delicious. The chicken wings are great. Not very chicken-wing-like; more like like little soy nuggets drowning in spicy sauce with a side of ranch. Super yummy. The artichoke gratine is amazing, also spicy. The chili fries are just ok IMO; their ranch is amazing though. Next time I would just get the fries with ranch to dip them in. Seriously the best vegan ranch I've ever tasted. I could go on and on because I ate practically everything while I was here. It's all good, you guys. I love that their water is room temperature. The people who work here are super friendly and helpful. The restrooms are great. You may be tempted to sit on the front or back patio in the evening because the weather is nice and they keep it pretty cold inside, but being eaten alive by mosquitoes is not worth it. Bring a sweater and brave the A/C.

Not bad. Clean, lots of equipment, not too many people on a Sunday afternoon. The restroom and locker room were nice enough. The restroom smelled like bleach, which I found offensive, but it wasn't too bad. I would definitely go here again.

I drove quite a ways out of my way to come here because it shows on yelp that they are open. Guess what.. They are not open. I will have to drive all the way back to where I already was to get juice at whole foods now. That sucks. I really wanted to check this place out.

Yes yes yes yes yes!!!! I LOVE this place! Crazy delicious food, amazingly friendly service, and their ingredients are pretty good, (some local, etc.) I wish they were open all day because it can be difficult to get out of bed early enough to come here, but it's totally worth it when I do!

I just drove all the way here, hungry and excited, because yelp says this place closes at 10pm. Apparently they are currently on their "summer hours" and close at 4pm. I do not understand this summer hours concept and I REALLY don't understand why you wouldn't update your yelp page to reflect this.

Two of the meals I've had here were easily two of the most delicious meals I have ever had. Service is super friendly. They have multiple kinds of hollandaise.  The wait can be kinda long on weekends. We have waited 45 minutes a couple of times. It was worth the wait though.  Restroom is good.

I love this place so much. Possibly the best waxing place ever. The wax they use doesn't hurt nearly as much as other waxes I've experienced. There is always someone in the lobby to greet me when I walk in. There is always someone to answer the phone when I call. There is often an appointment available right away, which is great for me because I have trouble scheduling anything in advance. Very professional feeling, clean facilities. Super friendly, professional staff. I've been to another location in Los Angeles too and it was just as great.  The restroom is nice.

This is seriously the best restaurant in all of Maricopa County. Organic, delicious ingredients, and they have options for just about everyone - vegan, paleo, nut-free etc. I wish I lived much closer!! Service was awesome. They were extremely helpful going over the menu with me to make sure I got exactly what I wanted. LOVE!
