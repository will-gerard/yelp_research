My friend raved about going to cracker barrel so we stopped by.  First time coming here from visiting family and i was not impressed.  The staff was friendly enough and the gift shop was the best part of the whole place. ..With lots of trinkets to look at and gifts to purchase for whomever.   But I'm sorry to say that I was not wowed by the food quality.  My mac and cheese was pretty tasty and the chicken fried steak had a good crunch and the gravy was tasty but seemed like it had a little too much flour in it.  My sides were luke warm of green beans and hashbrown casserole was mediocre.  The green beans tasted like they were out of a can.   Nothing about my meal seemed fresh.  The only reason I would come back is for the Mac and cheese and to browse the gift shop.

Came here for a late night snack and drink, there was no line and decided to sit at the bar since we didn't want a full meal.  The place wasn't that busy, but it was a Sunday night.  The restaurant was a little dark and had a hard time reading the mini menu so i had to hold it by the candlelight to read it.  The bartender was prompt in greeting us and took our drink orders right away and gave us full menus in case we wanted a full meal.    I had the seafood stuffed mushrooms and crabcakes.  The food came out in no time at all and was piping hot and the waitress made sure we knew that.  The mushrooms came with a dinner roll and served in an escargot dish.  They were smothered in cheese and very tasty, the bread came in handy to each with the cheese.  The crabcakes were on the small side, thought they would be bigger for the price.  They were also nice and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, served with a nice caper mayo with a hint of spicy.  The squirt of lemon added the right touch.    Nice restaurant, a bit pricey but a good place for a romantic dinner.  The decor needs some work since the paintings/wall art had pictures of women's legs and people talking intimately.  Not sure what theme they were going for.

So my friends and i stayed here for a night and it was a delight.  My friend signed up for the Marriot rewards program and got a free upgrade to a larger room and two free snacks from their little snack bar/stand thing.  Not to say they upgraded us because of the rewards program but i think the hotel was really full.    The room was large and i think it was a disabled room because the bathroom was huge and the bathtub had grab bars and a shower seat the could be folded up and slid across the tub.  This room came with a couch, desk,mini fridge, microwave, coffee pot with coffee, iron board, hair dryer, two queen beds and a couch.  Oh! and there was a sink in the little kitchenette area.    The beds were comfortable and my back didn't hurt when i woke up the next morning.  The best thing is the hot breakfast with a variety of muffins, bagels, toast, make your own waffle station, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, hot oatmeal, cereal, yogurt, toppings for the yogurt, eggs, cereal and waffles.  They also had apple and orange juice as well as coffee.  The best thing is that it was all FREE!!!  The only thing i didn't like was that the internet connection wasn't powerful enough for my laptop.  I would definitely stay here again.

This is a great hike to do for beginners and nice to go to in the morning. The 60 Degree weather keeps you cool.  There is a trail that goes around to the back so you don't have to rock climb up the face of the rock.    Looks like a lot of people bike through here and lots of picnic tables to eat lunch.  Seems like it can be crowded at times and the parking can fill up fast. We came in the morning around 9am and was able to find parking right by the rock. There are other parking lots nearby and not a far walk.   The view from the top is great for pictures.  I'm sure it would be great at sunset or sunrise.
