Fresh, coffee some of the cheapest in Scottsdale. Don't be fooled by cheap price though very high quality and hot or iced hits the spot everytime.Staff is always nice and professional some times a line early morning but, they get through it fast.

I have been here a handful of times now and usually order the chicken brisket or ribs, all that are delightful.I was here about a yr. ago and ordered the squash sandwich and was very impressed so, that paired with the fact that I am trying to eat better inspired my menu choices for this evening. They we're the tomato sandwich  Romaine fries & watermelon dressed with honey.It was spectacular ! I had doubts that ordering vegetarian at a barbecue joint could backfire on me But, it did not.If I could give the tomato sandwich 10 stars I would.Strips of romaine lettuce topped with an Italian dressing and lemon-superb.Watermelon was refreshing and sweet.Kuttos Bryan's for adding theses healthier options and making them very tasty too!

Meh.Eh.Just okay, I had not been here in yrs decided to give it another try.Latte was lackluster, no worth the $4.25 price tag for sure no flavor nothing special at all.Barista was " so tired" don't you know she has to wake up @4 in the morning ? I do because she said this to customer in from of me.No " hi," to us order was actually taken by another guy behind the counter who was the only one to say " thank you " to us.Barasta was a brunette who needs a nap and a lesson is customer service.

I first started seeing Dr manning when he was at gateway smiles as well,he has seen myself and my daughters.He is a great dentist,that puts you at ease from day one.I have since moved to north Scottsdale and tried another dentist office that I left almost in tears,I have periodontal disease,and am on a budget.Some dentists just make me feel like scrum for not having proper dental care my whole life.Not Dr Manning,not ever.I have had abscessed teeth extracted by him ,no judgement at this office they are kind and.welcoming and I truly believe concerned about their patients.

We have been here before and had a good experience.It seemed as if mgmt. has changed we have had Nick cut our hair (mine and my daughters ) and he was great.The reason I give a two star and not a one is because of that.I recently went here and the wait was long,ok I had time to wait and look through some style books,walk to walmart etc.However,when I am waiting the lady cutting hair takes a call on her CELL PHONE from someone I think is her daughter/employee she starts yelling "You sure don't listen do you?,Call me on my work phone." She then proceeds to read her a schedule so,Im not sure if this was daughter/employee or daughter.Irregardless,completely unprofessional.I left and went and had my hair cut at wal-mart.

I had Erica give me a mani \ pedi.She did a very good job. She was very knowledgeable and helped me pick a color ( a fabulous soft orange ) that really worked well with my skin tone. I am trying to kick my nail biting habit and she had great tips and made my small nails look fabulous . The whole staff there was welcoming & happily took my spafinder gift card . I was greeted with a smile and offered a sparking water. Salon is quaint and absolutely sparking clean . I will be back.

Very good fresh tacos $1.10 each.Wish we were here on Wends. When they are .75 I had the chicken - a bit spicy, definitely had a " kick ". Street taco size was perfect . Daughter. & Bf had carne asada, said it was " good and fresh " We ordered a horchata to go with perfect to cut some of the spice.Small place but staff was friendly & fast.

Atmosphere was very nice, store was clean and the young girl who waited on us was very nice and gave us suggestions.Unfortunately, it all went down hill from there servings are very small and about $4/each and not the most flavorful or best tasting gelatio. I think maybe freezer burn or something else was amiss.I was hoping this would be better the allure is there but the products just did not deliver :(.

Henry Did my Mani / Pedi.he was great.Very professional and no side talk.I'm a nail biter and not one time did he mention it.Only when I brought up how short my nails are did he suggest that getting my nails done may help.Very nice pedi.Great price salon is clean.Receptionist. was very helpful.

Hands down wonderful coffee.We will be returning to try some of the food & expand our coffee horizons.We had the Lattee ( Almond and Vanilla) we were going to just get one because we have gotten too expensive , not good coffee too many times before.I went back and ordered my own after I tried his.My daughter had a hot chocolate she was very pleased with as well.The staff was nice and professional.We will be back.
