This is probably THE WORST Hyatt I've ever stayed! If it wasn't because I was here attending a conference and my room was paid for, I would have never chosen to stay here. The hotel is so outdated and is not well maintained at all. The carpet is dirty and has huge stains. My room is on the 20th floor and the whole floor smells like greasy fried chicken from 20 years ago. Even the ceiling in my room is dirty. The shower in my room is clogged, water just stays there when i take a shower. Gross! The only good thing is that the staff is nice. Basically this hotel is way over priced. I wouldn't even pay $50 a night for it. It is so sad for the Hyatt brand. Horrible hotel, will NEVER return!

Top notch customer service!   I am a Hilton Honors member so I try to take advantage of the rewards program whenever I travel. I paid for a nonrefundable reservation and ended up having to change it to a different day. I was not able to change my reservation with Hilton Honors customer service so I called the hotel instead. The hotel manager chuck was very accommodating and made the change for me right away without asking any questions!   Then my car broke down on I-10 in the middle of nowhere in Benson AZ on a Saturday. I had to tow my car to Tucson to get it fixed. Under such a stressful circumstance, I didn't even know if I could make it to Phoenix on the same day or not. So I called the hotel again to inform them that I might not be able to stay that night. Seth was the one who picked up the phone. He told me I could call back anytime to cancel my reservation. He even called me later to touch base with me to see if my car was fixed.   Finally I made it to the hotel around 10pm. Seth was there to greet me, "Ms. Wang, I spoke with you on the phone. I'm so glad you've made it!" Suddenly I felt right at home. My hotel stay was short but wonderful. My room was clean and the breakfast was delicious. When I requested a late check out at 1pm, Seth gladly accommodated my request without a charge.   The customer is indeed God at this Hampton Inn. From several days prior to my arrival to the day I depart, this hotel was there every step of the way to provide me the best customer service possible. They went above and beyond to ensure I have a wonderful stay which I certainly did. I'd like to thank Seth and Chuck. 5 star all the way!

I will just start by saying I love Nobuo at Teeter House! I mean this restaurant is A-MAZING! I was in Phoenix for a conference for a few days, I am SO glad that I checked out this establishment.   It was a Friday night around 9:20pm. I came with two friends after shopping in Scottsdale. There weren't too many people as it was near their closing time. We were seated quickly. I looked around for a bit, the restaurant certainty lives up to its name: it is in a house! I really like this unique setup and the ambience is pretty upscale. Our server seemed very nice and was knowledgeable about the items on the menu. I wanted to order the pork belly with steamed buns but was told the steamer left for the day and it was for lunch only. So I ordered the pork belly wrapped in banana leaves and the Japanese kimchi. My two friends ordered a shrimp and a fish dish.   I have to say that I loved the pork belly. It came in a very nice presentation wrapped in banana leaves. The pork was very tender and juicy. The rice that came with the pork was very tasty too. Oh, let me comment on the Japanese kimchi please. It is out of this world good. Like what our server told us, the Japanese kimchi is fresh so it is very different and a million times better than the Korean version. I let my friends have some of my pork belly. Both of them raved about it. My friend's fried shrimp came with some veggie in the middle. He shared some with us, it was very good I must say. The other friend liked her yellowtail too but the portion seemed a little small to me.  We left the restaurant very satisfied. The food was so good that i was still thinking about it the next day. Man, I wish I had more time in Phoenix so I could go there again. The restaurant is a little on the pricy side but I think it is definitely worth it for the quality of food and atmosphere. BTW they can validate parking but not for valet parking though which we paid $10.   Overall, it is one of the best Japanese restaurants I've visited across the country. Actually scratch the Japanese, it is one of the best restaurants i've visited by far. I'd come here everyday if I could. It is THAT good!!!
