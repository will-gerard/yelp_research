Nice airport. Had to take 3 people mover walker things from "B" to "A".  It seemed like miles before I got to the A concourse. Fox Sports Club was crazy busy, but the waitress was nice. Took off on time (hell it was midnight, we sure as hell better take off on time) and landed in PHL on time!

What's there to say? PHX is a nice airport, food choices decent, bathrooms clean. Need more seats in certain boarding areas, and the free wifi wasn't working properly...ah well.  Beggers can't be choosers, right?

Parked in their parking garage, didn't think our SUV was going to fit, but magically it did.  Went up to the top, come to find out that the elevator doesn't go to the top.  Parked the vehicle, go down to the street level, and find the validation machine so we can walk around the "Freemont Experience" for a couple of hours. Casino is old, stale, and just...weird.  I appreciate the 3 free hours, but sheesh, the casino needs a makeover ASAP.

The men wanted to see the slot machine that hadn't hit in like 20 years, or something like that.  Fine, whatever you guys want to do, the ladies are going to go shopping.  Parking is crazy, huge parking structure.  Take a picture of where you park, it's just so much easier that way.  We started out downstairs, where some of the restaurants and clubs are.  Very nice area, super clean.  Oh and there's a Fat Tuesday there, which the men were super happy about.  We come up into the lobby and HOLY CRAP...the line to check in was insane!  This was on Monday--- Memorial Day!  The line snaked around the huge gold lion in the middle of the huge lobby. Crazy.  So we left the guys at some video poker, and we went and did some window shopping.  There are some cute stores, with an assortment of goodies to purchase.    The Wedding Chapel was pretty, if you're into that kind of thing.  There's a Starbucks down where the candy store is, and it was pretty good.  Didn't have raspberry syrup though, not that that's a deal breaker.  On the way out (a couple of hours later) we passed through the lobby again, and the check in line was all the way out to the lobby doors.  WOW!  Didn't get a chance to see the rooms or anything, but what we did see was pretty nice!

Pretty cool aquarium, situated inside of Mandalay Bay.  Sharks, jellyfish, a petting pool of sting rays and horseshoe crabs, and lots of cool viewing areas.  ~$40 for two adults during prime time  They have a season pass that offers a discount and other goodies if you're interested. And a cool gift shop full of plenty of items for the kids.

The ladies working at this particular Starbucks were pretty damn peppy working late at night (red eye) and mid-AM.  A line with about 15 people in it, grumpy about their flights or having to pay for outrageously priced food (I fly first class, so this doesn't necessarily pertain to me) or their screaming child, these Starbucks workers had a smile.  The drink could have been a little stronger, but I know now to ask for another shot next time.

Weird place. Random shops selling random stuff. Homeless people holding buckets for money. Places selling $1 frozen margaritas.  There is a Starbucks in there, and I feel like it could be a cool place to go if/when it becomes more modern.

Fries are good, that's about it. Place is ALWAYS mobbed because it's the only eatery open in a concourse where two (!!!) red eye flights to PHL and Charlotte take off.  Fries and a Starbucks.  Yum.

It all depends on when you go. We went over the Memorial Day weekend holiday, and there was an awesome selection PLUS an additional 50% your purchase.  Found a new purse, wallet, and scarf, all for less than $200.  And we're talking about a big bag.  My friend got a purse, and wristlet for about $200.

Wow. We had an amazing meal here over the weekend (Sunday evening at 6:00pm), and if I could afford to eat here every weekend, I totally would!    Jonathan at the desk seated us, plus recommended wine and cocktails to start our dining adventure.  He chatted with us, before leaving us to peruse the menu.  Then our waiter Roberto came over.  What an awesome waiter he was!  He took the time to tell us the specials, and when I asked him what his favorite things on the menu were, he didn't disappoint.  We started with the caprese salad (the man), and beef carpaccio (me).  Wow, wow, wow.  My beef was incredible.    For entrees we had the 10oz filet (the man), and the agnoletti (me).  Roberto said his favorite was the agnoletti, and that choice was perfect.  Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, perfect pairing between the buffalo mozzerella, pasta and sauce.  Gosh.    Finally for dessert we had the seasonal crostini, and the lollipops.  Both were so good!  Excellent meal, we will definitely be back!

What is with the Dunkin Donuts in Las Vegas? Poor customer service, the registers don't work (both times, months apart!), and I'm left wondering what I'm charged is even remotely close to the correct amount.  Been here twice, both times the registers aren't working for whatever reason.  We order a couple of things, then I'm charged some random amount.  Never get a receipt because the registers aren't working.  The worker making the drinks had to ask the person taking the orders what my order was several times.  What's so hard about a large iced tea with raspberry?  Come on Dunkin Donuts, work on the customer service!

I heart me some DD. Being from the East Coast, living in CA, I miss my Dunkin Donuts like crazy, but LV made me happy by having a Dunkin Donuts for my coffee pleasure.  We went through the drive thru (a DD with a drive thru!), ordered a few donuts, and a couple of cups of coffee before our drive back to CA.  He got my iced coffee order wrong, but happily replaced it with what I wanted.  Donuts were eaten very quickly in the backseat, as I sipped my coffee most of the way back to CA.

I love Dunkin Donuts, but this location is just poor. Went through the drive thru Tuesday AM, ordered several items, and we only got one item correct.  Hot coffee instead of an iced coffee. Wrong donuts. No diet coke. No straws.  Had to park out front, and go inside to fix my order because it was still wrong after leaving the drive thru.  It's a shame because this is a great location, but the staff needs a lot of training.

YUM! The burger was fantastic, the fries were delicious (especially with the seasoning salt!), and the milkshake was the perfect ending to the meal.    Many different burger choices, too many milkshake flavors to choose from, and the ability to customize your burger how you want, fantastic!

Took the place of the mediocore Fox Sports Grill.  I had a water and a Barfly burger. The burger had cheese, lettuce, tomato and 1000 island dressing on a decent bun. Came with fries and a little thing of ketchup. Burger was good, well cooked but the patty didn't have any flavor. The 1000 island dressing gave it a good tang. Fries were blah. Water was good :)  I'd go back, it was a nice place. Anything is better than the Fox place or the sausage place down by A13.

Best BBQ I've had. We stopped here for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. It's in a strip mall located near a Christian radio station and other assorted businesses.  I had the BBQ club wrap and DAMN was it good. Delicious, filling, tasty, flavorful, cheesy, meaty. Plus they have sweet tea and I'm a sucker for sweet tea.  The man had 1/2lb of brisket, and it was sooooo tender and delicious.  Did I mention the BBQ sauce on the tables? Delicious.  Our friends got a plate of various ribs which were fall off the bone good, and the same wrap as I.  You must try this place!!
