Worst place ever!!! Avoid it at all cost! the staff is mean and rude, They don't give eye contact, and asked me to leave when I was not ready nor was my party! The lady manager is horrible!! This place needs to close immediately.    The mash potatoes did not have any favor to it.

The white macadamia cheese cake was too rich and I did not have the taste I thought it would have, I guess it's best to stick with the vanilla bean.  The guy at the Togo cheesecake counter is nice.

We sat a place in a circular room and the waiter there kept calling us boss which we don't like, and then someone closed the blinds when we wanted them open.  We told  David to close them, but it kept going up and down it was annoying.  We told him we were not happy, and then the manager comes and talks to another table to ask them how they are doing, what about us?   The situation was bad, and when we asked the manager about it, she said that she wanted to get the table sat and really did not care about what other people thought basically.    Well avoid the place, they are more concern with filling tables than customer service.

mean and lost minded electronic employees a store that doesn't know what they have in stock and they don't order new products.  This girl doesn't need a job if she is going to be late and rude too.

Lydia is great at her job, she welcomes you talks to you like a friend and wants to make you happy, she was fast and friendly a thing that is gone from almost every fast food place.  Lydia even asked if we needed anything else, got some honey and hot sauce for us too.  She has a great smile and personality.    Bathrooms were clean and enough space to eat your meal in the dinning room.    Yummy ckn and mash potatoes too!

Food is okay I had the 51 dollar steak, it was tough made med/well instead of med.  My mom's steak was better than mine which was okay/fine. . . it was not the best.  Mesa grill was better and far more faster especially when we were the first people to come in we did not get our food until 42 minutes.  It's a little crazy and when the manager came he said I ate too much , which is okay for me because I cut the little thing up for my family to taste to make sure I wasn't crazy because it did taste funny and if it was wasn't true wolf gang look at the video, I don't look happy and I was the birthday boy.  okay they bright out 3 deserts for me so I change my mind :)

Usually I have a good time here but we came in to have a "free drink", from the yelp deals and the host immediately told a server, the server told the manager, and the whole restaurant that we were only suppose to have just a regular drink, like a well and nothing else.    Then everyone kept watching us rolling there eyes at us and the manager kept close to our spot and kept on talking about us.   It's not like we were stealing from them or anything.  If they can't support yelpers or make them feel welcome like other places they should leave yelp deals and/or close down if they can't be nice or/friendly to yelpers, it was just rude and killed my groups mood.  BTW we came yesterday spent over $100 and 3 months ago we spent over $200. if they don't want us you are just losing $ and being rude to people that once liked you.  Very bad for RedSquare.

Even though I love it here they should keep the people who know about the place to answer the phones and answer the questions without getting no one in trouble, if not stay off the fucking phones.

Awesome bathroom,  going to it has a bent hallway and when you get in the restroom the room is all twisted and bent too... neat.

Love Sandbar, I feel welcomed every time I come. Jenn makes a great sweet tart in fact the sweet tarts here are always blue, some other places change their color from blue to a weird green color, but here it looks appealing  Management is always nice to and are great people to say hi too.  Anthony always makes this a happy place to be and Richard help makes it even better each time.  Dancing is always fun too, and oh drinking out side in the sand neat.

It's blue, like sad, food is not too good.  They copied Deluxe in Scottsdale, that place is the one to go too.  It busy, tasty, and fun.  This blu burger is not, but the fries are good.  Interior is nice but I think the staff just gots to be more friendly.  I feel like I am the one being judged there, it should not feel like that.

I had the steak and added shiitake mushrooms and they already cut the steak in pieces with the mushrooms.  There was fat mixed in so it was sometimes gross, because it is a little dark inside the restaurant where you could not really see what you were getting.    It came with mash potatoes that tasted instant with a taste of horseradish.  My coleslaw was warm and did not taste that good either, server was nice but food was no good.

Hello I stayed at Rumor last night and the a/c was not working in our room.  Our phone did not have a tone only when you put in on speaker.  I called down stairs they asked me if I wanted someone to fix that I said I would call them if I did but first I wanted to try to fix the phone myself in case they was something unplugged.  Then they send someone to the room when I was in the bath.  I told him not to come and he had an attitude when I asked him to come back later.  There were people smoking weed outside so we could not open our window, this made it a horrible night.  I told the staff lady Emily that we were going out and to have someone fix the a/c but no one did.  So we rode it out that night and in the morning I went to check out and I told Jessica that the a/c still was not working and she did not even say sorry or anything that would comfort me.  All she said was that she would send someone to fix it, yeah right.  The only good thing about this place was that the the room looked nice.

Low class service, nobody to seat you, all the workers are doing their own thing and not worrying about the customers.  The restrooms are dirty and smell nasty.  The bartenders don't say hi or thank you for coming to their lonely bar.  By the way they don't even say hi, plus their bar smells awful too, like something spoils!

The employees here are way too nice and friendly.  You can bug them anytime, and they could make special arrangements for your pets food.  Don't tell anybody though it's a secret.    They have neat stuff here for you lovely pet to enjoy and I think the mostly neat thing for your dog is the pet feeder for your friend.  It slows down the way your dog eats.

I miss the Tater tots, they need to bring that back, and lower the cost for lemonade $8 is too much.  The employees need to help with the menu instead of rushing you.    The lobster on the stick is still amazing though love it yay!

I was liking this place but the handle was so hard to push down I did it and it hurt me when it came up.  It feels bruised and it almost took me away from eating but wow they need to fix that, I don't like it and it's not safe for little kids to be doing that.    The yogurt is nice, I like all the selections they have, and topping are neat too like brownies, crushed cookies and marshmallows.   Staff is nice too, but my hand still hurts.

Worst place to eat, they forget to bring your food and ask that you pay for the food you did not get.

They would get 5 stars but they need to be making their Mojitos all the time so that I could get them, they stop making it at 8 but while I was there, nobody was ordering at the bar and the bartenders were just standing there.

My plate had 2 sausages and one of them was raw, I told the server and he just looked at it and said it was okay, I told him that the other one was good but this one was red and bloody.  He did not do and thing and walked away.  My sisters skillet of egg and pork tasted weird not good at all she did not even finish half her plate.  My moms French toast was probably the only thing that was good about the place. It looked nice and tasted good, she said it was sweet I thought it was just right, but I do love sweets anyway.

The food had too much sugar, the chow mein did not really have any taste to it, the orange chicken was okay but the garlic chicken with mushrooms was weird.   I did not finish my food, one of things saving this place was that it did have coke there.  When I arrived the lady that served my food was too busy talking to her employees and they had to stop her for her to even acknowledge me.  Not coming back, I will probably go to McDonalds next door in the food court.

Lame, the food is too spicy or too greasy to eat.  I got the sampler platter and it was just fried food, I did not like any of it, I had to go home and eat something worth eating that was fried, this place did not cut it.  I like mixed drinks this place did not really have anything for me, this place is probably good for beer, but who knows because I don't drink beer.     We did get seated fast but the food is not worth going for even though the waitress was nice and friendly, food doesn't add up.

Came in asked to sit by the bar.  No seats so my group went outside and sat on a community table, then I was told I could not sit here because I had to get someone to sit me by the waitress.  I went up front asked to sit where I was just at, which was available, went back to the table with menus this time and surprisingly got the same waitress who just told me that I could not sit here.  LAME and stupid.  She gave me a lame excuse that people just come and sit anywhere ... well if you want money they should be able to sit where they want right???   Almost left because of her, but stayed and had an okay time.   Customer Friendly no-  I been to places where the people say that it's okay I sit here and THEY BRING YOU THE MENUS, not where you have to go to host to get permission where you just sat and for them to bring you the menus.  It's just lame.  I don't care if this place makes because with this experience they should sink.
