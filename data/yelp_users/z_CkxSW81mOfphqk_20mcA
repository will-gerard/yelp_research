Ever stop for a meal and regret it as soon as the meal came?  The food is un inspired, plain tasting. Probably just reheated.  The music is great for people who grew up in the Dick Clark era - like my mom and dad - but they would not pay that much for a meal.   It's like a wanna be restaurant.  Maybe a visit from Chef Ramsay would straighten them out! Thee only reason two probably survive at all is because of the Dick Clark name an the bar is close to the exit....

Sat on the deck on a beautiful, sunny day and fed the cat.  She wasn't a fan of the onion rings - but my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed these! The Horseradish/ranch dip is amazing! A couple of lemonade to wash it all down....a nice snack in the afternoon.  Can't give a 5 star - didn't really sit long enough or try enough variety to rate any higher. Would visit again.

I just ordered the 'hamburger' then added my favorite toppings.  Another excellent burger, I have to say! Plenty of meat, freshly made - and hot off the grill!  Top notch fries as well, overflowing from the cup they put it in.  It takes about 5 - 10 minutes to get a great, fresh burger like this - but is very much worth the wait!

Fantastic experience.   I found Johnson roofing using the YELP app, and the reviews were great.   I am a Canadian with a seasonal home I visit several times a year in Gilbert. Finding quality trades people off the internet is a little nerve wracking. You are never sure if the reviews are totally legit!   So I came for a visit to my humble abode this summer and alarmingly found a few tiles from the corner of my roof lying on the ground. It looked minor, but I don't have a ladder tall enough to go see what was happening!   I did my Yelp and Google search for local roofers, and came across Johnson roofing. I spoke with a friendly office person who asked me to simply send some pictures and they had a $250 special that would likely cover the minor repairs. They wouldn't need to come and look - the pictures would be enough information and they could book a time based on the pictures I sent.   So off to the yard with my trusty iPhone and zip-a-da-do-da I emailed the pictures. It was a Friday afternoon, and I was told it may take until early the next week to confirm the job. Tuesday I simply received an email saying that they would be by Thursday at 1pm.  I was out enjoying a beautiful golf day, and when I was done there was an email with a dozen pictures showing the extensive work they completed fixing much more than just a couple broken tiles!!   Very impressive service Johnson Roofing!! Thank you for that!
