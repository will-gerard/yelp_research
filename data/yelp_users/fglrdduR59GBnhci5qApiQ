Eating here right now.  It is very good. We haven't been in a long time. The atmosphere is really nice. It is very clean and decorated nicely. The employees are nice and friendly and welcomed everyone as they entered.  The food is very fresh.  The fries are yummy. The grilled chicken sandwich with bacon is delicious. Very nice lunch.

I love this store. It reminds me of going to card shops with my grandma when I was little. This store always has the most fantastic Hallmark ornaments and decor at Christmas time as well as other novelty items throughout the year. They have such a cute array of trinkets and treasures. It Almost reminds me of a small brick and mortar type store.  There are always sweet little grandma-like ladies working there, just adding to the "little store down the street in a small town"  kinda scenario.

Do not shop at Best Buy!! They have a FIFTEEN DAY RETURN POLICY ON EVERYTHING!!    Even if it is DEFECTIVE!!   I bought a pair of $150 headphones, 17 days ago.  They have a short in the left ear bud.  I used them four times,  for an hour, to take walks .. I tried to exchange them this morning and they refused, stating their return policy!  So do not purchase from them. Especially something of value.  They do not and will not stand behind their merchandise after FIFTEEN DAYS!! I don't even know how that can be legal!

We ate here recently, I won't tell you the exact date, in case this review gets back to Steve, our waiter.   But I will say, we eat at Carrabas probably 10 times a month. It is one of our favorite restaurants. On this visit,  we were ordering. I Ordered my usual salad. Steve asks me if I want to add blue cheese and I say "Sure" then I say, "I have never been asked that before, is that something new?" To which Steve says, "no, I always ask everybody if they want blue cheese" and I said "Oh" so I said "Sure, I will add blue cheese" then he proceeds with my  husband's salad and asks if he wants blue cheese, my husband said "no".  Another wait staff member walks by.. Steve, in a proud like manner says "Hey! Who adds on the most blue cheese here?"  The waitress said "You do Steve" not missing a beat or a step and just kept walking. So, I said to Steve, " Why is it such a proud accomplishment to be the highest ranking blue cheese giver at Carrabas, is there an up charge for it or something?"  To which Steve replied "Yes, but it's only $2. And you get a nice big chuck of blue cheese". And then I said "Well, you didn't mention the $2 up charge Steve." And he said  (in a gentlemanly cocky and arrogant way) "I said would you like to "ADD" blue cheese, that's how I do it" and I said "You are a rat, I don't want the blue cheese".   So moral of my story, In MY PROSPECTIVE or PERCEPTION, whatever you wanna call it, Steve is a scammer.  And the only reason he is top blue cheese sales guy is his ability to "fake" people into thinking he is just adding a nice chunk of blue cheese on their salad. I guarantee you that if he told customers clearly, up front about the $2 up charge, half of the customers would decline the add on.  Most customers probably don't even realize the up charge on their bill, or if they do, then Steve just says, "I said " ADD" then the customer feels stupid and Stevo wins!!!!! You better believe when our bill came, I looked it over, not for the blue cheese ADD ON, but for anything scammer like.  If he feels proud and like he's the pro at getting people to buy something they are not aware of, I don't trust him as far as I could throw him.... Moral of the story; a chunk  of blue cheese on your salad is $2 out of the pocket.  Just so you know .

I absolutely LOVE this Chandler location. The staff is so amazing, The design specialists are top notch and visual team is superb.  The store always looks fresh, clean and inviting.  I find the best time to go is in the morning through out  mid day until around 6pm. any day of the week. The "In store" designers are there and can pull together any style of vignette you are looking for. Sometimes it is frustrating when something I want is out of stock or can only be purchased online , but again, the staff try their very best to accommodate you the best they can.   I also LOVE the Pottery Barn credit card !! Everyone should have one!  You get 10% back on every purchase and all kinds of fun little perks throughout the year.  I love all Pottery Barns in general, but the Chandler location is my "go to store" if I want top notch customer service and attention. I live equal distance between the Scottsdale location and the Chandler location and I always choose Chandler.  The parking is MUCH EASIER to navigate and the store is one level and so easy to move around. You should go!!!  They also have a BATHROOM!! And it is right beside Nordstrom.  Have fun!

Absolutely the MOST fun day you can have with a limited budget and all age ranges... Everything about this place is perfect. I sincerely appreciate how they don't price gouge you for an ice cream cone, snack or soft drink. All snacks and meals are very reasonably priced, so you don't feel robbed or that you have to "share" because there are five in your group. You can honestly come here and spend the entire afternoon with the kids and leave feeling accomplished and refreshed.

AHMAZING store! Creative and stunning vignettes throughout the whole place. Not cheap, not even inexpensive, pricey is the word, but you have to pay to be unique sometimes. definitely a treat to see the store, smell the store, touch the things in the store and if you are lucky enough, bring home a special treasure.  It is magical especially this time of year! I love that the employees let you browse without bombarding you with tacky sales pitches. They are there to assist, but let you take it all in at your own pace.

I love this salon!  All the positive reviews on here are 100% accurate!! It is wonderful! Loretta, the owner does my facials and she treats me like I  at the Royal Palms!  Tara Genger does my hair and she is wonderful!  She's the only stylist who has ever been able to blow dry my frizzy hair into a silky mane without using a flat iron! The whole place is busy all the time which tells you a little about how good it must be and it is open 7 days a week! Loretta, the owner is an aggressive go getter, in a great, positive way! I drive 45 minutes one way to go here, I probably pass 200 salon and spas on the way to JFY, but it is worth it!

Brought my 11 year old in for a cut and style and eyebrow/ lip wax . We were a walk in and they were able to get her  in within 20 minutes. Ashley was her stylist. My daughter may only be 11, but she has adult hair! Lots of hair and very thick, long and wavy. She got a cut with lots of layers and added bangs . Ashley did a great job cutting and styling her hair. She blew it out straight and it looked very chic. Ashley also waxed her brows and lip. Total Cost for everything was $52. Plus if you  post a review on YELP, you get 10% off on your next visit.  It is in a great location inside the mall, lower level by Dillard's. They also carry OPI nail polish in every shade under the sun as well as all the best brands of hair care products. I was happy with the service and our experience here and would go back.

Brought  my 13 year old daughter, Reese in for a cut and style tonight. The last time I reviewed this Salon , it was when I brought Reese in when she was 11 or 12. We have been many times since, but I forget to always write a review.  My daughter has really curly, frizzy, thick, unruly "beach" hair. It is long, half way down her back. Rayna did a fabulous job on her hair. It looks gorgeous!  So much so, that I made an appt to go see Rayna on Friday for a blowout.. I have the same hair as my daughter, only worse. It wil be interesting to see if she can blow it out perfectly.   I will update the review on Friday.

$109 bill. I hate it when I feel like I could have had a better meal in my own kitchen. Why would you serve me brown sugar that is so lumpy and hard as a rock?   It wasn't even sticky or the rich brown color nor did it smell like brown sugar should smell. It's obvious it was stale. Why would you even bring that out to me?   The 6oz filet was so thin and had no texture to it at all. I eat filet mignon ALOT, and in the price point that Outback is selling it for, it is outrageous that it tasted like it did. I had to ask for A1!!! IF A CUSTOMER HAS TO USE A1 to choke down a $20 steak in your restaurant, SOMEBODY SHOULD BE ARRESTED!!!    The waiter was pleasant. The sweet potato was good, even without brown sugar.  But I can make a sweet potato at home for 1.00.   I didn't like this visit at all, and for me to give it another shot, it would have to be FREE!    I would rather go Mastro's and spend an extra $15 for an 8oz filet and feel like I died and went to heaven. People who eat here are selling their taste buds AND their self respect short.

First of all, all these Yelp complaints seem to be from telephone reviews.  If you have never been into the actual store you have no idea what's going on with this store or the owner.   The owner is very old. He is a master at his craft. He is old fashioned and he just might he an "old dart" As someone said. But he does fantastic work and like I mentioned, he is a master at his craft. He is OLD SCHOOL and probably just doesn't have the patience to deal with you over the phone. Maybe he can't even hear you. He doesn't even take credit cards, he still accepts CHECKS for crying out loud. I wish we could Go back to the era of men wearing suits and looking dapper.  James is probably sick to his stomach that the world has gone to hell in a hand basket and people have given up dapper suits for grunge wear and flip flops. Give the old geezer a break. I have had many pieces altered here and he does incredible work.    He is from a time when men did deals on a smile and a handshake. He has  always been very considerate and kind to me

Red White and Brew is the perfect example of how a restaurant should be run!  The quality, consistancy, food portions, food choices, staff, cleanliness etc is absolutely impeccable.  Ron, the owner,  should give classes to other local establishments on how to run successful business.   My family has eaten here for the past 9 years at least twice a week, sometimes ordering to go food as well as having them cater many large private parties for us as well, I have never come across a better place to give my money.    The first time I ever ate heree (9 years ago) I remember be "put off" by the location, but please, if you are petty like I am, give it a chance.  You will have it on your weekly dining out calendar once you do!   :)   Cheers!

This is the food service selection  at 8:45pm, That is FORTY FIVE MINUTES before they close. WTH!  If you are going to be open until 9;30pm your menu should be available until 9:30pm!!!! Ridiculous!!

I really like this location now. I came here a few years ago and was not impressed at all. I signed up at a Scottsdale location and went every two weeks for two years.  The therapist that I fell in love with there got pregnant (uugggggg) really? She obviously didn't ask my opinion! Anywho, she ended up leaving and I didn't love anyone else at that location that much to drive the 25 miles one way.  Soooo, I came back to this Mesa location. I walked in and said I need a deep tissue therapist who knows what they are doing. They hooked me up with Heather and it has been pure heaven ever since! I have been seeing Heather every two weeks for about four months now. She is wonderful, the staff has been upgraded, and they changed management since my last experience a few years ago.  I  am thrilled that I only have to travel five miles instead of 25 miles.   They also do facials at this location.

Went in today for a 90 minute with Ben. First time I have been in this location for a out six months.  Went today because my girlfriend told Me about Ben. Ben was INCREDIBLE! I told him I was a Runner and he catered a massage to fit in with my personal needs as an avid runner. He was professional and really did an amazing deep tissue sports massage focusing on my legs and glutes.  The massage was worth every penny and more.  I hope that massage envy owner and management realizes what they have in this talented guy and does what they have to, to KEEP HIM HAPPY, so he doesn't leave, and I say that because Every time I get a great therapist here, they always end up leaving after a short while.

My husband turned 40 on Friday, November 4, 2011.   For 3 months I planned a very involved surprise party. I visited MANY Scottsdale clubs, bars, entertainment venues etc to prepare for his "after party.'   I chose Martini Ranch over all of the other places I visited first and foremost because of Mike and Robert.  I dropped in one afternoon to check it out and there was a band setting up for that evening's entertainment. The downstairs has been newly remodeled and was very nice.   Robert took me on a tour of the entire club. He never tried to rush me or make me feel like I was a bother.   Many of the places I checked into, the club managers either never returned my calls, didn't show up for our meeting or acted as if they had something better to do.   Mike and Robert were fantastic to work with.  I was in contact with them for a month leading up to my event (I am a freak) and they were always so nice and fun to talk to.  The night we showed up, Mike and Robert were there prepared for our arrival with wristbands and escorted us right to our VIP area.   There were 60 people in my party.  Ages ranging from 23 to 50 years old.   There were mant different age groups at the club in general. Everyone was so friendly.  Our group all had wigs on and random people were coming up to us commenting and laughing at our wigs. Very easy going crowd.     The 3 bands downstairs were fabulous, but as the night progressed we all ended up going upstairs to the DJ area. We arrived at 8:30pm and closed the place down!   Maybe it's not the most prestigious place in town,(according to some of the reviews I read) but with that you miss out on all the pretentious snobs that go along with that type of environment.    Our goal was to go and have a carefree, fabulous good time and we did!  One of my single friends even met a really nice guy. We met him for lunch this past weekend.   I didn't really pay attention to drink prices, but if your on a strict budget, maybe clubbing and drinking shouldn't be a priority anyway.   Even though we had eaten before we arrived, it was nice to have the food vendor available for late night snacks.  Dancing really burns the calories!    The bartenders upstairs were so nice as well. The dreamcicle was my drink of choice.  The "pole dancers " were also a hoot! They were so polite! Everytime I put a dollar in her bra she actually thanked me! HAHAHA!   Several reviews mentioned the bouncers being "asses".,Anyone who works in that environment night after night and sees the "crazies"  they do has to be on guard. They are there to do a  specific job and they do it very well.    The bouncers even had to reprimand a few crazies in our group, but I completely understood. They are there to "bounce" crazies" and I am glad, for my own safety.    So, ANYWAY, longest review ever......  I close by saying, It was a very important night for me, and it couldn't have been better!  I loved it! We all had a great time! I love Mike, Robert, the pole dancers, the DJ, the bartenders, the bands the bouncers etc!  Made awesome memories!  Thank you Martini Ranch!

We went here last Friday night 1/10/14.   Had a reservation for 4 people at 8pm. Got there a few minutes early, ordered a drink in the bar.  A few minutes later our name was called. The place was packed, that is a testament to their customer following as the dining room is rather large.    It was our first time here.   I loved the complimentary crunchy, thin toasted bagels and rye bread.    We Ordered the artichoke dip (free for checking in with YELP) and It was good.     I had the 8oz charred filet, it was really good! I ate the whole thing!  It was served with a salad and a ginormous twice baked potato! I couldn't eat half of it, but it reheats very well wrapped in tin foil in the toaster oven. FYI.   Ryan ordered prime rib, Peggy and Haynes both ordered ribs with cold slaw.   We all enjoyed our dinner very much.   Good selection of wine and cocktails as well.   Very old school supper club kinda vibe mixed in with all that sports memorabilia.   We will definitely go back.  The management and waitstaff were very attentive and personable.   The ONLY gripe I have is that I wish people weren't dressed so casual.  We were all dressed up as it was Friday night and this isn't an inexpensive restaurant.   I felt sorta overdressed compared to the other customers, but not for the restaurant, if that makes sense.   I am guessing they have many local regulars who feel comfortable going " up the road" in their uggs and sweats or jeans and sweatshirts  for a nice steak.   But that complaint really has nothing to do with the restaurant and my dining experience.  I guess I feel the need to bring it up because it took me by surprise how some of the customers were so under dressed. More like a "Chilis and dollar movie night" rather than a $300 meal in a nice steakhouse kinda night. But anywho......   We really enjoyed the food, the waitstaff and management and we will be back..  Oh!! The creme brûlée was wonderful! Banana cream pie was really good. The chocolate cake, huge and pretty good.   We will be back..  Excuse my choppy sentence review. But you get the drift. :)

I love this store. I always feel like a queen when I shop here. Today, after purchasing my new FENDI bag, I told the sales lady I was going to the perfume counter next, she asked what I wanted and ran over to get it for me. I jokingly mentioned these were my Christmas gifts to myself, After I paid, she offered me a claim check and told me when I was finished with my shopping to pick up my packages from customer service. When I picked them up, they had been wrapped so beautifully complete with a gorgeous silver NM keychain.  I only wish the cafe were open later as a strawberry popover would have been delicious while shopping...

I went in the Scottsdale store today. off of Lincoln. Maybe I am a snob, but this place was just like a Goodwill. The prices they are asking for some of these used designer items are rediculous. It smells awful, old and stale in the here. I came in looking for a Chanel bag. I had just left Neimans at Scottsdale mall and wanted a new bag so bad. The one I want is $3300.  I was thinking maybe I could find one here. I thought I would try this store because their reputation is supposed to be high end, well maintained designer items.  It was gross actually, very used and worn clothing, outdated, with designer tags stapled back in.  It looks like I will be going back to Neimans tomorrow for that bag after all. I also have $1,000's of dollars in gorgeous clothing to resale. I was considering taking my items here, but I think my things might be too nice for here.

We came here tonight for dinner because we had a gift card. It is only the second time we have ever been here since living in AZ for 12 years.  The first time was 3 years ago, for my 40th birthday, my husband rented out the upstairs bar area for a few hours on my "progressive party tour" unfortunately I hadn't paid that much attention to the place the night of my party because we were so busy having fun, opening gifts and figuring out our next destination, so the place didn't really stick out in my mind. I am so sorry it didn't, BUT I am so glad I got the gift card! I was in love the minute we walked up and heard the live " Island music". Being a huge Hawaii fan, I melted away to my favorite island.  The ambience is terrific, the food was terrific, although very rich, next time I will ask for less butter served with my fish. I ordered macadamia crusted talapia and Ryan ordered the sanibel chicken. We shared the coconut shrimp beforehand. They serve hot fresh bread with tasty flavored butter while you wait. The desserts were amazing! Especially the Creme  brûlée  served inside a pineapple ring. I LOVED the fresh island flowers on the table and the fluid tropical flair.  Also, when the bill was presented, the waiter gave us tropical postcards to fill out and give back to them to mail! I thought that was an amazing personal touch.  It was pretty cold tonight so the open air doors were closed, but I can not wait to go back and experience this restaurant again. The waitstaff was awesome, the hostess was awesome, they all were dressed in island type dresses. I had a great time. Much more so than I thought. Also, if you are planning a private event, my husband said when he was planning my party there, he went in and the manager gave him a sampling of all the food that was to be on my party menu. They were very attentive and eager to make sure he was taken care of.  This place will definitely be on my regular go to dining out places from now on. We travel to Hawaii often, and it totally reminded me of many of the restaurants there especially in Whalers Village, minus the ocean of course. So please try this place out sometime. It also doesn't suck that it is located in Kierland Commons either. Aloha!

Even though today's visit was AWEFUL, I am still giving this place four stars. I love this place and I am a diehard loyal customer.   I can overlook one bad experience, but it still stinks to have spent my entire day here, celebrating my girl -friend's birthday and have it not meet my customary  expectations.   My girl-friend had a birthday today, I told her I would take her and our other best friends out to lunch wherever she wanted.  She chose Tommy's.  She chose the place based on how incredible I'm always telling her it is.  There were four of us .   I won't go into what we ordered because it was all delicious. The waiter was not good at all. I felt like he thought we were a bunch of middle aged woman who were not going to tip well, so he pretty much gave us mediocre service the entire time.   After he brought our lunch he hardly ever returned. Actually, he didn't even deliver our lunch, two other young men brought our lunch to us.   We had warm, watered down glasses of ice tea, that were never refilled or replaced.   We started off with mimosas and the birthday girl switched to beer, He brought her one Beer before the meal arrived and never ever asked if she wanted another. Another friend and I sat there eating our lunch with melted and watered down tea never having a fresh drink refilled.   The man beside us had a birthday, the waiter brought out a beautiful chocolate cake with a lit candle. After. my g-friend opened her presents I asked for a dessert for the "birthday girl" and he brought out a sliver of pineapple cake, I said in a sweet, happy, upbeat voice, "It's her birthday , can we have a candle?" He said we don't have any. I mentioned that the man beside us had one, the waiter said "last candle, sorry" and walked away.  He never offered us cappuccino or coffee, which we all four would have ordered, nor did he bring by the dessert tray, that he took to every other table around us.      We saw him displaying the dessert tray to the table beside us and we looked over at how pretty it was, I made a comment to the waiter  " Why didn't we get to see the dessert tray" he just walked away. He never even brought it over after that. We would have ordered a few more desserts if he would have asked.     Our bill could have easily been another $100 above the $140 that it already was if he would have been attentive to us.    I took a picture of the gross, watered down, sweaty beverage glasses that sat on our table the entire time we ate. He came back very infrequently and when he did, he was so quick to take away a plate and leave, that we didn't have time to notice he was even there to request something before he was gone. He was like "swoosh man".         Anyway, all four of us felt very slighted and left feeling less than happy about our experience, ESPECIALLY me because I picked up the check.  I stilled  tipped him 18% out of habit and guilt I guess, but felt remorseful about it hours later after my girlfriends and I were STILL talking about our AWEFUL experience . Very dissapointed.  He really did himself a disservice by judging us.:(    :( I still love this place .  I just spent 2 weeks in Hawaii and lived half of our vacation at the TB in Whailea and Whalers Village.

Ate here this past Saturday 1/25/14. At 2pm. As always, I ordered the Carne Asada, with pork, beef and chicken. Shared it with my  Daughter and even had enough to take home to my other daughter.    Nine hours later all three if us were throwing up like mad!!!!!! It was aweful!!!!   It had to be this dish as it is the only thing the three of us had eaten that day.   Before we had all gotten sick that night, the leftovers had been put into the fridge earlier that day, So, unbenounced  to me, on Sunday night, my son ate the rest of it. I had no idea, UNTIL 3 am on Monday morning, he was hacking all over his bedroom!!!!   I asked him what he ate, and he said the left over Tia Rosa!!!! OH Lordy! I had forgotten it was in the fridge!!!   So, just wondering if anyone else got sick from eating Tia Rosa Carne Asada eaten on or around Saturday, Jan. 25.    I have never had a bad experience at Tia Rosa and we eat there often, but I am going to call and ask for a refund! I know accidents happen, but I am not going to pay for improperly prepared food that made me SICK AS A JUNKYARD DOG!

Tonight was amazing! We drove here from Mesa because I wanted a fun, festive atmosphere for dinner on Christmas Eve .  It was PACKED! We waited over an hour past our reservation time, but we found a spot in the bar and ordered appetizers and drinks. the mozzarella squares were delicious!!!! The calamari was good along with the bruschetta. The entrees were good, I didn't love the presentation of the lobster dish, especially for the price. I wouldn't order that again. We even got a few pasta dishes to take home for a lazy lunch tomorrow.  Extremely impressed with the service and quality of food considering how SLAMMED the place was! True sign of a well run restaurant is how they handle stress and volume. Gabriel was our waiter and he was extremely pleasant and very professional. Thank you Maggianos for making our Christmas Eve so festive and perfect! Now, hopefully you all can go home and enjoy your holiday.

Nice theater. Always clean, staff is abundant and always visible cleaning and walking around. But the snack bar attendants are slower than molasses!! It is so frustrating. There is no sense of urgency whatsoever, it is like watching a movie in slow motion. I am not a slow paced person by nature so I literally want to jump behind the snack counter and do it myself.... I have never been a snack bar server, so maybe I shouldn't judge the severity of the work, since I haven't done it, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt, but I ran two miles, made a sandwich, did 3 pages of 3rd grade common core math  and washed my hair all while writing this review, so how hard can it be to scoop a bag of popcorn and pour me a coke?

Those cookies I spent $100 on New Year Eve were horrible! Dry, tasteless and just plain horrible. So very disappointed. Giving the bakery one star for serving these horrible cookies.  Everything looks so wonderful and beautiful in the bakery case, but I will get a sample next time I invest that much money into a dessert... I went in just now to order something else and I mentioned to the lady how horrible those cookies were, there were some still in the case, maybe they made a fresh fresh batch with the same writing (2014 on them) but I told her the ones I purchased on New Year's Eve Day were horrible, and she just sneered at me and helped the next customer, whom ironically were buying those same cookies! I told the customer they were horrible. They only bought the two already in the container and got Cannolis instead. The passion ice tea is really good though. But I am too upset over throwing away $100 on stale cookies right now to be positive.

I tried to give this place half a star but it wasn't an option.  Went for breakfast at 8am. Only two other people eating. Seats were ripped, my glass was dirty, when I reached for the catsup bottle, it was empty! It's 8am, obviously there is absolutely NO attention to detail here. My husband ordered sourdough toast, they were out of sourdough already! Really?!  The waitress looked like a SLOB! Cut off shorts and old t shirt.   I ordered an omelette, potatoes and wheat toast. Potatoes bland, omelette cold, wheat toast was burnt. Waitress didn't seem to notice, sat it right down in front of me anyway.  It is pathetic really.  The place is very cute and quaint.  Has SO much potential and could be just as busy or busier than Crackers, which is PACKED all the time.  Obviously very poor management or ownership!  I live right down the street, my husband and I didn't have the time to go all the way over to Crackers like usual, so we came here.  Biggest waste of $30!!!! It is not cheap food but cheap in every other way!   So sad!

I am not a small town go sit in the Cheers bar and drink kinda girl. This is the place my husband would take the kids for dinner on nights that I had other plans. This went on for about three years. One day, a few months ago, my husband asked if I wanted to meet him for lunch. He was already at  Lucky Lou's when he called me, but because I had already eaten and he had just picked his dad up from the airport, (His dad just flew in from Chicago for a visit) I would meet them and get a little bit of chat time in before we had to pick the kids up from school.  I asked my husband if they served diet coke, because I don't go Anywhere they don't serve diet coke!!! He said they did so I was on my way.    30 minutes later I was hogging down my husband's Philly cheese steak sandwich and fries!!!!! OMG!!! It was amazing!  I could hardly move when I left! The diet coke was delicious too!  I could not believe how friggin delicious that sandwich was!  Ever since that day I get mad if my husband goes there for dinner with the kids on the nights I have other plans. I am addicted to their Philly sandwich and the buffalo chicken sandwich. The fries are Rediculously good!  And every time we go the staff is always so nice and friendly. It really is a lovely Place.  I love you Lucky Lou's! I am truly the lucky one!

I am giving this place four delicious stars!  As we were sitting in the restaurant I was on yelp reading the reviews peeps have written on this place.  I think some of were smoking crack when you wrote your review.   This place is NOTHING like Chilis! The menu is large but it has a fabulous selection of items to choose from.  I started off with the coconut shrimp skewers and a artichoke dip.  Both were wonderful!   For dinner I ordered the Micau   Shrimp soup and salad. It was fabulous!  if you ask for more broth, less egg noodles it is a very healthy low calorie dish that is full of steamed veggies!    My husband ordered a steak and our kiddos had ribs. They loved their food as well.   For dessert we ordered their in house made Creme brûlée, but I guess it is very popular and they had sold out by 8pm.  Double sad face. :( :( ..  So we ordered the ice cream cake with Oreo crust. It was very good.  The kids had ice cream sundaes that came with their meals.   I think this place is very nice.  Our waiter, Tim, was very attentive even though the place was packed!   It was still very busy when we arrived at 8pm. We waited about 20 to sit .  The atmosphere is very lively and fun.   Yes, the kitchen is loud and sorta out in the open, but that is part of the fun.  I enjoyed it very much and we will go back soon.  If you haven't gone I suggest you give it a whirl!

I just had the grilled shrimp and arugula salad, AGAIN!! Absolutely delicious! Dressing on the side for a no guilt, healthy, delicious and filling lunch or dinner. I am also taking home several desserts. Magic bars, giant macaroons, peach and almond bar (first time for this one) and a few raspberry scones, one of which I am eating while writing this.   Stellar cafe and awesome waitstaff and employees.  Make sure to bring dollar bills so you can tip them accordingly.  Tipping  is optional, but they do a great job of refilling your drink, getting extra napkins and anything else you ask of them.   Enjoy.

Not a lot of parking, but the facility is run very smoothly and efficiently as far as I could tell. Line was long, but we were in and out in 30 minutes.  Nice, clean facility.

I went to Whole Foods for the FIRST time (in my life) today! I went because my hairstylist suggested I should go there for organic facial cleanser. I was in AWE!  I walked around the store for 30 minutes just looking around before placing anything in my cart.   Then I went crazy!  If you are looking for fresh, organic, gluten-free, house-made, etc you will be in heaven!  Any soup you can imagine is hot, fresh and ready to go home with you. Also at your fingertips are salads, a hot bar, cold bar, homemade dinner entrees bar OH MY!  Fresh pastries, breads veggies & Juice bar.    Not to mention the restaurant, deli, olive bar, butcher, all chicken is free range.   Then you have the vitamin department. Every vitamin you can imagine.  I bought several essential oils and some coconut oil.  They even carry TOMS here.  Shampoos and the organic facial cleanser I came for. WOW!  Oh, and the floral department. It is small, but they had some of the prettiest, freshest, unique flowers and herbs I have seen anywhere.  They even carry curly willow!  I am in LOVE!   When I checked out, I was offered a complimentary bag of ice to keep my dairy products and meat cold on the drive home .    It is not cheap and I would suggest you bring  recycled bags for your groceries or you will feel like you single handedly contributed to the deconstruction of the ozone layer.  I think I was the only customer who had to ask for brown bags. It was a wonderful experience.  I had to call my husband to pick up the kids from school because it was so hard to leave.

I love this place! My husband and I go about twice a month for date night. Sometimes we sit at the bar to get the entertainment factor. You'll know what I mean when you go and I ain't talking about the live music. For a more romantic cozy dinner we sit in the dining room. The lobster mashed potatoes are a delight to the senses!  Anything on the menu is delicious. I love the 12 oz filet, it only cost a few bucks more than the 6 oz so it is a better "deal". The place is not cheap, But it is by far the most delicious steak and seafood you will ever eat!  The butter cake with fresh berries and made to order whipped cream is a heavenly dream. What are you waiting for!  Get in your car and go!!!!!

Got here at 1pm. Only two tables eating lunch. The Chips and salsa is quite fabulous! Ordered spinach enchiladas, it came with sautéed zucchini and rice.  My friend ordered chicken enchiladas. We ordered the cream sauce On the side because I was afraid of all the YELP reviews about the excessive cream.  I thought is was a wonderful lunch. Total lunch bill for two people was $28. Including a $4  Bud light. ( little pricey) but no different than eating anywhere else.   I did not order the table side guacamole, but to defend the $9.99 price, I watched it being made at the table next to us. The waitress used three huge avocados, which are $1.99 each right now at Bashas.  So people that are complaining about the price of the table side guacamole price really should go buy the ingredients yourself and make it at home.  What else???  The place is huge and has a corner location. I can't imagine the rent on the building!  I thought the prices were fair, they have coke products (not flat coke either) it is a nice clean location and every staff member was very attentive . The waitress was pleasant and well groomed.  I would go back.  So that's my review in a tortilla shell! HA!

Hobby Lobby is awesome!!!! BLOWS Michaels away!!!  I went to Hobby Lobby last night and had two 24x36 photos framed.  Michael (The Wolfman) helped me out in framing and he was fantastic to work with.   Everytime I go into this store I find what I need. It is very fairly priced and their clearance sales are almost cheaper than FREE!!!!  Thank you to whoever invented this store!  My only gripe is that they are closed on Sundays, so I guess a 'Praise the Lord" would be in order.

It was alright. The encrusted goat cheese medallions in the goat cheese salad had way too much breading and it made them very dry, and they didn't taste like goat cheese at all. I have had encrusted goat cheese medallions at several places that were DELICIOUS, but these were not really good at all, although, you get about five medallions on the salad.  That's a lot!!! I'd rather have three medallions and have them not skimp on the goat cheese and leave out the breading. The rest of the salad was ok. They have good coke products, so I would come back again and try something more savory and with bread next time since they make their own bread.  My three girlfriends had sandwiches (one had the prickly pear chicken and loved it) The other girls loved their food too.  The atmosphere was nice, the waitress was very nice and the manager stopped by to see how we were doing.  I'd give it another whirl.

Fantastic day! My suggestion; Go in on a Sunday, around 4pm. The bar was pretty packed at this time of day, but the restaurant was empty.   Sit down in the restaurant area.  It is fun to watch the restaurant transition from a whimsical  Sunday Fun-day type atmosphere to an exotic and demure nightlife Restaurant.  Around 5pm, they begin to dim all of those gorgeous chandy's and close the thick shutters. Around 5:30pm, they start lighting and dispersing LOTS of little tiny votive candles to all the tables and wall mounted candelabras.   The restaurant is starting to fill little by little and the noise level goes from quiet to loud and bustling. The day shift is transitioning to night shift and the waiters are polishing their tables and preparing for a packed house. ( The restaurant is completely booked for dinner reservations ) The menu at this time of day is very simple as they are preparing for dinner.  But the simplicity of this menu makes it easy to order light hearted items.  The filet skewers and shrimp skewers are delicious.  Order the table side guacamole!! It is fantastic !  The bread pudding was delicious, but priced $2 cheaper on the menu than we were charged on our bill.  We were also charged for a chicken skewer $12, that we did not order.  We had to bring this to our waitress's attention after we received the bill. Good thing I doubled checked the bill as my husband didn't even look at it and just plopped his credit card down.  When I mentioned the discrepancy of pricing to the waitress. She took off the chicken skewer, but not the $2 additional charge for the bread pudding. We didn't push it, because who wants to be a bitch over $2, but just check your bill before you pay.  Overall, I loved they whole experience and I can't wait to go back!!!   Oh! I posted a picture of the bread pudding and the picture looks disgusting. Tried to delete the picture and I don't know how.  The bread pudding is delicious, even though the picture I took looks like bile topped with ice cream and bed bugs.

I've eaten here three days in a row now. It's two minutes from my house. I've passed it a thousand times and would never consider eating here, because the location isn't Enticing or interesting.  Six of us girlfriends had a garage sale this past weekend and one of the girls went there to get us all food. The chips and salsa were delicious. The tacos were awesome. The salad was wonderful.  They also have good Coke products.... It's cheap and from the looks of it, they make the meat to order, that's why it might take longer, as some Yelp people are complaining about the long wait.   My third day in a row eating here, so it's definitely good.

Why have a phone if NO ONE EVER ANSWERS! You get a recording of all the hours and directions then it says gives you prompts for specific departments; "check on an order , place and order, speak to an employee" ....None of the prompts EVER gets you ANYWHERE!! I have been trying to call them for three days. Do not make me come up there! I bet they want me to come up there!!

We have Driven past this  joint 10,000 times over the past few years and never given it a second thought.   Ryan was having a new stereo system put in our daughter's car at the radio place a block away & he walked here to wait for them to finish installing it.  He called me and asked if I wanted to meet him "down there" for lunch, I said sure, I was sorta tired of watching the "Who the bleep did I Marry" marathon anyway.    I want to make something clear; THIS IS A BAR! A JOINT! A hangout of sorts.   Let's be realistic and call it like it is. I don't like it when people review places going into it with the wrong prospective or expectation  and rating it as you would a five star dining experience. IT IS A BAR!   I walked in, found my honey sitting between the 42 year old high school drop out and,  I am pretty sure the guy I just saw featured on "Who the bleep did I marry" a few minutes ago. Buuuuttttt. Anywho....  I sat at the bar and hung my brand new leather CHLOE bag on the convenient hook located just under the bar top.   I sat down all ready to be pissed from reading the reviews. But again, I realize I am in a BAR, so I have no expectations.    The diet coke was really good!   The felon (beside me) and his tatted up friend ( is tatted spelled right) like he had a lot of tattoos, isn't that what you called "tatted???" ANYWAY, they had just gotten their food when I sat  down.    One guy had a rueben which looked pretty darn good with crispy rye bread and extra thousand island with waffle fries, his friend  had a 12" hot dog smothered in chili and cheese.  When the bartender placed it in front of him, the tatted guy yells "holy shit" and, after seeing it with my own two eyes, that was a spot on analogy! It was huge and it cost $3.99!! It came with fries too. I believe it was called the home wrecker or the hijacker, something like that. Felon guy made a great comment about "wrecking his toilet" later and giggled as he began to dig in.  I looked over the menu forever! It has a fun concept referring  to most food items in categories titled for cities and streets in Chicago.   The bartender came over and asked what we wanted. I told him I really didn't want to eat anything fattening and greasy. Realizing I sounded snooty after I said that,   he very nicely recommended a Chicken breast topped with Swiss and avocado. Then he said "instead of fries, we can do a dinner salad."  I said "PERFECT!!"  Ryan ordered a personal pizza. I don't even know what kind.   I also ordered fried pickles, cause I tend to like fried pickles. :)   The bartender kept my diet coke fresh the whole time. That is huge extra bonus points when a waitstaff person does that for me!   The food was really good.  Let's Remember,  IT IS BAR FOOD!!   The dinner salad was good. I took a picture for you. I also took a picture of Ryan's pizza, my sandwich, my Fried pickles and a friend who met us there ordered chicken fingers. They were HUGE!!!  I took a picture of those as well.  The young, pregnant barback was really sweet and was working really hard the whole time we were there that I observed. The bar was packed as was the outdoor patio.   I did smell a little bit of smoke coming from the patio outside, but (say it with me) IT IS A BAR!   There are awesome Tv's everywhere. It would be a fantastic place to go and watch any sports game that was on or you could play a little pool too.   They have happy hour everyday from 11-7pm. The size of the beers were rediculous. They also have a "free ride home" service which I was pretty impressed by.   I don't drink beer, but if you do, you will be happy here.  I saw a few hard ass looking motorcycle guys, a lesbian in a tank top and cut offs, a few families with small children, young, blue collar guys enjoying a day away from the naggin wives, several husband and wife enjoying a beautiful Sunday, and just regular ole everyday people like myself.   If you just throw all of your  expectations out the window when you go here, you might be pleasantly surprised by the warm, neighborhood hangout kinda vibe it has.   Every staff member was very pleasant and all of the patrons were nice as well. When our friend came in to join us at the packed bar, the lone man sitting next to me actually got up and offered him his chair.   The bartender was very pleasant and made a nice lunch suggestion for me, he kept our drinks full, he made conversation and joked with all of the patrons.  Even though the bar was full, he didn't ignore anyone that I saw.   I would go back here for sure. And BELIEVE ME WHEN I say; I have high expectations when I eat out, shop, whatever, but I am also a realist and realize some places are supposed to be a certain way. Like a BAR. There is definitely a specific vibe in here and it is what makes this place  fun and sets it apart. :)   We will go back and maybe make a few friends next time we are there. After all, it would be intriguing to have a friend on parole .

This used to be the best nail salon in east Mesa. I have been coming here since they opened about 6 years ago.  Lately I have noticed a SEVERE decline in cleanliness, consistent service and customer service every time I go.  Lynn, the manager who sits right at the front on the left when you walk in, is very nice, always calls me by name. I Hope she reads this review. Your staff is starting to slack off. The manicures are SO inconsistent lately. Sometimes I get hot water in the little glass bowl, sometimes it's cold. Sometimes they use a lemon to rub on your nails, sometimes they don't. Sometimes I get a back massage, sometimes I don't. The biggest issue lately had been the old nail polishes they are using!!!!! They always have to add water to them to be able to soften the polish, I actually saw a tech using nail polish remover to try and open a sealed and crusty nail polish yesterday. What happens when you use old Polish is that, #1 IT IS OLD! #2 it is gooey and thick and it doesn't set well which causes it to bubble and peel within an hour of leaving the salon! It is a Hassle to have to come back in a few hours and feel "bad " because they did an awful job much less the additional time out of my day to have it fixed.  Yesterday when I was getting a pedicure, the tech actually scoffed at me when I told her I wanted the " basic " pedi but to use the good exfoliator. She actually argued with me about how bad my feet were and I needed a different  pedicure . First time I have ever left without tipping!! Speaking of tipping...... I can not STAND IT when they insist I tip in cash!!! So insulting to me, a person who pays taxes on my salary and I have these people insisting that I tip in  cash so they can hide their salary. I usually accommodate and pull out cash so they don't talk bad about me when I leave , but from now on, if I wanna tip on a credit card, I WILL TIP ON A CREDIT CARD!!!!  If you have an issue with it, NO TIP FOR YOU!!  This is the ONLY SALON I have ever been to that insists on cash tips. Even at the Thai foot massage , the have a tip line on the credo card slip, here they don't! Clean up your salon Lynn. Nail Salons are a dime a dozen and your loyal customers are only as loyal to you as you are to them and right now your loyalty is like a bad foot fungus!

I love Fully Loaded deliveries. Chris and his team have moved my family over six times. they are very professional and always clean, neat, well mannered, pleasant and nice to work with.   Moving can be very emotional so having a nice group of movers working with you to make it seem effortless is such a comfort.     I had the guys come out yesterday just move some things around in my house. My husband hates moving things, especially large pieces up and down the stairs, so, I hired Fully loaded to come over and help me move all the large pieces just to redecorate.    It also helped that they had just moved me in two years before, so they knew my home and my furniture pieces very well. One guy even remembered how the armoire was to be dissembled.      I highly recommend them for your local, long distance moves or simply to redecorate your house.  OH! I forgot to mention, one of the pieces they moved was a 700lb welders bench UP 16 stairs. It was INCREDIBLE to watch.... I had my life savings bet that they wouldn't be able to do it, but they did and did not make one mark anywhere.  I was SO worried as I have a gorgeous solid wood staircase and it would have been ruined  had they dropped the 700lb steel frame on the stairs.    I was amazed.. I kept cheering for them from the top of the stairs. "Come on hotties! Look at those muscles! Holy crap, I have never seen such men of steel!"   I think it worked..:0

You know how I know this was a bad experience? Cause all I thought about during my entire 90 minute " massage" was writing this yelp review.    I have been here many times, always very satisfied, but yesterday was AWEFUL!   Three customers in the whole place and they had us all right beside each other. The employees were whispering back and forth to each other. That is distracting.  The whole experience was so distracting.   Every time they would open the door leading to the back room, it created this  "Whooshing" vortex sound, followed by laughter and talking, either they were having a party in the back room, or the back door was open to the outside and you could hear lots of other people talking and laughing. Either way it was so irritating and uncomfortable. The back room door was opened at least 12 times during my 90 minute session.   So I never had the chance to relax at all.   I won't mention the sound of the toilet flushing, some things, I realize can't be helped.   The back door, combined with the whispering, combined with the plastic bags they use for the foot bath bowl, being opened and placed in the bowls for the next customer almost drove me mad!  It was this crunchy cellophane sounding noise. So DISTRACTING!   That, combined with the buckets of water being poured at top speed into the foot bath bowls, combined with the annoying finger popping and palm slapping they do on customers, combined with the CONSTANT phone ringing at the front desk!!   Aarrgghhhhhh!  I literally almost got up and left two or three times!!   The massage lady literally left me a few times to go into the swooshing back room, I am assuming to get the hot towels, she was gone for an eternity. The second time she was gone for so long, I literally sat up to make sure I wasn't being punked.    She rubbed my head lightly for AT LEAST 30 minutes and lightly feathered my feet for another 30 Minutes.  She  "feathered" my arms for a few Wasted miñutes and rubbed my back for the last 2 minutes before doing the HORRID act of palm slapping to alert me it was over!!!  She never moved around to different muscles or pressure points. She sat and stared off into space and rubbed one area of my foot forever. I peeked out from under the washcloth and she was totally zoned out.  I think she had gone to the beach! I was supposed to be zoned out, at the beach, NOT HER!!!!   Oh!! I almost forgot about the music!! Which I wouldn't even bother to mention had everything else been perfect, but since the whole experience was so AWEFUL, I might as well complain about everything!!   The music was  from a Beethoven concerto number 45.  It was upbeat and fast at some points.  I heard church bells in one song I swear!  I want to hear ZEN music or the ocean!!! I am here to relax! But I left a great big ball of aggravated NERVES!!!   I honestly thought I was gonna peek out from under the cloth to find the Blue Man  Group standing there ready to break out in some iconic song using all the noises in the place... "Swoosh Swoosh, crackle POP! Flush flush! Ring ring ring! Church bells pouring water pour! Pour!   Anyway!  That didn't happen, at least that would have been entertaining.  It was not good. :((   One bad experience is all it takes.  :(

About a month ago we went to the Mesa PF Changs for dinner...... Long story short, the service was mediocre and disappointing at best.  We paid the bill and a manager walked over, knowing we were dissatisfied with the quality of service and food, handed me a card for a free appetizer to redeem on our next visit.  So they were not willing to compensate us for THIS miserable visit, but they were assuming we would want to come back. Hence the coupon.   I took it and we left. About two weeks later, my son asked my husband and I to pick up dinner for him on the way home from our date night. We went out to another restaurant for date night, but my son, requested that we pick up PF Changs for him.  My husband and I go in and sit down at the bar to order the meal to go. We both ordered cocktails while we looked over the menu. We ordered my son a $15.00 meal to go and had a bar tab going at this point. We were stuffed from dinner, but I remembered I had the free appetizer coupon in my purse. I pulled it out and asked the bartender if there was any way we could use it for a little dessert instead of an appetizer since we were not hungry for dinner. He called over the "manager"  Matt.   We explained to Matt that we would love to use our "shitty service coupon " on a dessert instead of an appetizer. With the most condiscending tone and attitude he says "Oh sorry that can only be used for an appetizer." So, confused at Matt's stupidity and aloof attitude and nonexistent customer service skills ( HELLO IDIOT!!!!!!! Do you not even wonder how we got the stupid free food card in the first place!!!)  You think possessing that card would be a red flag that states "TAKE CARE OF THIS CUSTOMER!!!!!".  So, after mulling over Matt's ingnorance over not giving me a $4.95 dessert, that probably costs them $1.00 to make, I ordered the most expensive appetizer on the menu, $10 shrimp. We had it wrapped up to go.   My husband and I must have been obviously miffed, and I still am not sure how the slick and perceptive bartender relayed the message to Matt,  but as we were paying our bill for the drinks and my sons food, Matt walks up to us and says, "Can I get you two a desert, and Recommends the banana egg rolls, which are, I must admit fabulous!!!!  We both looked at him like the wacko that he is and said "No thanks, we are just leaving."  So, to recap, We had a miserable visit, they tried to compensate with a coupon for our next visit, but on our next visit we left more aggravated than on the initial miserable visit.  Hence this lengthy review..... Customer service is common sense based. You either possess it or you don't .   I have no desire to ever return to this location. Too many fabulous places to eat and spend my money with people who appreciate my business and who realize that Customers like me are the ones who keep them working!!!!!   Ugggg! Even more frustrated that I just spend 30 minutes of my life writing this review .  I hope it saves some other poor soul the trouble of eating at this location.

I came in to for an hour massage. The lady at the front desk was pleasant, she lead me into the room with a door. I undressed and as I started to lay on the bed, I noticed all these icky tiny hairs all over the bottom sheet. The room was very dimly lit, and I still saw them. I moved the top sheet, and there were long hairs, short hairs and short, short, curly little hairs.  Ewwwha! I hurried and put my clothes back on and said I Had an emergency and I left.  Ewwhaaa!  Other than that, my experience was awesome.  So, yeah.

I went in yesterday for a 90 minute massage. It was wonderful.   I think the place has new owners and they were very intent on making me a happy and satisfied customer, after a visit last year (under old owners) that  left me not wanting to return...  But I am so happy that I gave this place another try.   It was wonderful.  The space was dark and quiet, Very relaxing and calming.  The music was nice and soothing as well.  I requested a firm pressure for my shoulders and neck area and he did  a great job.  It was a great massage and very helpful in loosening up my tired and sore muscles. The next time I think I want to try a 90 minute reflexology massage.. The detox massage sounds wonderful also... The place was very clean and and the beds were so comfortable. I loved the hot foot bath too. There were several other customers there at the same time, but it was still very quiet and private.. Each area has a drape that partitions and separates  each customer, so it is nice and private.   I would recommend wearing very loose and comfortable clothing as you do leave on your own clothes... There is no changing into hospital style scrubs like in some other places I have been.    I was offered a glass of cold water after my season which I thought was nice.   I was very happy with my service and the pricing was very fair also.   I will return here for another massage soon.

I went on yelp looking for a place to get a blow out. Had planned on going to Scottsdale to Primp and Blow on the Waterfront, but could not bring myself to do it based on the yelp reviews concerning the owner's conduct in dealing with her customers, so instead of risking it, I found another place closer to my home to try.  "Got Roots" had six five star reviews so I thought I'd give em a whirl. I called this morning and was able to get an appt at 2pm same day.  That was a bonus, although I do realize I might not be as lucky next time so I will make my next appt in  advance.  Natalie answered the phone and booked me for 2pm. She was very pleasant and sweet over the phone.  The place is hidden in the Basha's shopping center, I think another reviewer referred to this place as a hidden gem and that would be an accurate description.  The shop is small and not perfectly decorated nor really exciting  to look at. If I were the same girl I was in my 20's and  late thirties , I probably would have driven on past this salon as I was very much into image and "the scene " back in those days. But with experience comes the knowledge that just because a salon looks expensive and is expensive doesn't mean it is deserving or entitled to be such.  Took me years to figure that out. I walked in and was greeted by Natalie. She took me to the chair right away. I explained how I was looking for a new stylist since mine recently moved to Texas and it is very important to me that a stylist can blow dry my hair correctly. I have very course, extremely frizzy hair and it is virtually impossible to find a stylist who can blow out my hair to look like silk, the only one who ever achieved this in all my 45 years, was my stylist, who recently moved to Texas. She could blow it out so gracefully and never used a flat iron and it literally looked  like silk every time.  Natalie said she was a little nervous but was gonna give it a try.... As she started blow drying my hair, she told me how her first job out of cosmetology school was working at a high end salon and all she did 8 hours a day for a year was wash and blow dry hair. I Don't think she realizes what a great thing that was for her. As she parted my hair in segments and brought out the big round brush,  I was feeling confident. When she was 3/4 the way finished, I told her I knew immediately that she knew what the heck she was doing. I am so absolutely impressed with her blow out skills. She did an amazing job and made it look so simple. When someone can do something hard and make it look so simple, that is a talent.  She was very down to earth and sweet. The other girl working next to her was also very nice.  The blow out was $22!!!  I am planning on going back in a few weeks to have her color my hair.  I was very impressed Natalie and I will be going back.

Busy with Christmas shopping all over Kierland and Scottsdale quarter tonight. I was so hungry and was craving Mastros  really bad,  but since Dominick's was right close by, and I have eaten there many times with my husband, I felt very comfortable going in alone for dinner.  I sat at the bar.  I ordered a 12 oz filet, cooked medium, it came out so well done it tasted like hamburger. It was also AT LEAST 5 oz of fat and gristle.  I texted my husband and asked him if a filet should have fat and /or gristle, because I didn't want to look like an idiot for complaining, although I have never seen it that way before.  And of course he said "No!" I am pretty convinced, now that I am sitting at home all cozy writing this, that  I wasn't served a filet after all. I also ordered the Brussels sprouts, they were good , but soaked  in butter, so much so that I had to pat each one with a beverage napkin before I ate them.  I also ordered a $9 side salad that was less visually appealing than a $5 Chili's side salad.   Presentation was awful. And all the while this was happening, I was privy to obnoxious booty call music blasting from the speakers. I looked around at the clientele and I must have looked lost because the bartender actually apologized several times about the music and said it was an embarrassment to the caliber of restaurant that Dominick's is supposed to be known for. They have stopped having live Music and their "Very near future plan" is to cater to a younger, hip hop crowd, cause that's who spends hundreds of dollars on dinner. My prediction is; THEY WILL BE OUT  OF BUSINESS BY NEXT YEAR THIS TIME IF THEY CHOOSE TO GO THAT ROUTE! Somebody needs to slap some sense into the management, investors, owners, and whoever else that will listen.  I am 45 years old, I enjoy nice, quality, high class dinner places. I will spend the money on proper food and ambience. If I want a booty call, hip hop, take me down to china town, rip roaring good time, on a Thursday night, while Wearing a cashmere turtleneck and ughh  boots, it is not going to be at a boom boom club that sells me a $150 mediocre steak dinner.  Bring back Frank Sinatra and the classy old school bar and atmosphere that this place set out to be. WE OLDER FOGIES are going to keep you in business, not the wanna be rich, white, cool kids.  PS; the bartender bought my  steak and apologized many times.  He was just as embarrassed as I was confused and unhappy.  We will not be returning here, we will go up the street to Capital Grill , or the other way for Flemings or take it all the way down to Mastros.

Thirsty Lion used to be our go to spot for lunch or dinner anytime. But today was really a miss for us.   The ceviche is a very tiny portion, served in a shot glass filled with half lettuce. Lettuce should not be a food item in ceviche anyway!   Margarita pizza had no mozzarella on it and maybe had one sprig of basil on it, with cherry tomatoes....WHaattt!!!!     Waiter was nice and very pleasant, but the hostesses were all very sloppy and looked very disheveled.  One hostess had hair extensions that were peeking out of her scalp and her hair was all matted and tangled in the back. I think she was the same one who had on a skirt and she had tattooed letters all down her legs, it looked as if a four year old drew all over her before she went to work, Maybe that's actually what it was, Nothing wrong with tattoos or hair extensions, but pull yourself together for gosh sakes!  Look presentable, you are the first impression to customers.   We complained about the ceviche, and never did a manager come over to apologize and we saw the waiter explaining to him from across the room that it wasn't good.   This place seems to be going south fast.   We would normally eat here three to four times a month, but unless they get it together, we are not interested in returning.

Walked over here just now from Joyride,  Which we had to leave because the mood and vibe were akin to being laid back while watching the rest of the room spin out on speed!! Much better vibe and mood for this night . Bartenders are Laid back, not pretentious yet observant.  Ordered a nine iron and several bruschetta. The Brie, fig & Apple is delicious and the prosciutto & marscopone is heavenly!!!  Great ambience. We left at midnight and didn't feel rushed at all. There were still a few patrons chilling out.

I was a drop in at 8pm. They close at nine, but got me in. I was the only customer in there, so it felt a little weird. The place is sandwiched in between a Rosatis and Cafe Zupa. So don't go for a massage if you are hungry!  I felt so guilty having the sweet lady rubbing  all over me on a Friday night after 8pm. If there were other other people there getting massages at the same time as me, It would have felt more normal. But anyway! She did an amazing job. Her hands were so strong and she was very consistent and through. Just when I thought it was over, she had me go into the room where she massaged my back and butt! I wanted so bad to say "oh yeah, that feels awesome" but it felt creepy to say that. After she was done, she handed me an icy cold bottle of water. I will definitely go back probably for a longer session!

Walked right in. I admit, I brought my 11 year old daughter in to get a cheap haircut and style.  Everything here is ala cart, so if you want a hair wash before a cut,  it's $5, a cut for an 11 year old is $13 and a style (blow dry) STARTS at $30 - $45. So my 11 year old, who will probably jump in the pool 20 minutes after we leave here will have just cost me around $80 (with tip) .  Not the pricing I was expecting from great clips to say the least.  But it is a great place if you don't care if you hair is washed before it's cut or styled when you leave. Haircuts are $13. The place  was clean, the employees were nice. The lady (Marilyn)  that did my daughter's hair was very nice and did a great job. She had nice hair too so I trusted her opinion. Weird how humans judge like that I know.  Several guys came in while we were here and were in and out in ten minutes. I would bring my sons here for sure and my daughter if she just needs a quick trim with no add ons, otherwise I will just take her to my stylist. It would have actually been cheaper.       Hour later follow up; After we left the salon, I realized that my daughter 's hair looked really pretty. Marilyn did a wonderful job on the cut and style.  My daughter (11) was so excited and loved it.  The total was $48 and I tipped $10. After getting over the " ala cart" pricing,  I am really happy with our service.  Also, Marilyn must be good, because everyone that walked in after us ( 6 people) requested Marilyn.  I would take my daughter back to this location and ask for Marilyn.

My daughter had TWO flat tires on a Sunday, god forbid. We YELPED tire places and this one was the only one that came up as open on Sundays. So, we drove the six miles from where her car was sitting, to here. Admittedly, being a nice, upper class white lady from the suburbs, I was a little skurred of what I was gonna get when I came here to have the tires fixed. One tire had a HUGE nail in it that they took out and fixed, the other tire was ruined, slashed to pieces because my daughter drove and drove AND drove on it, so we bought a cheapo used tire from them for $25 to get us through the weekend , and  they put the existing rim on that tire for us .   I have to say, it was a great experience and I would go back here in the future for certain tire situations, that is, If I don't have a heart attack first from my daughter'a stupid life choices!

Chipotle is such a RIP OFF!! I swear, does anyone else not see how SKIMPY THEY ARE WITH THE amount of MEAT SERVING ON THE BURRITOS!!!!!   When I am ordering I say "Hey! Put more meat on there please" but tonight my 16 year old daughter went and picked up dinner.. I don't know if they took advantage of her being aloof, but there is literally NO STEAK  on this $7 STEAK BURRITO!!!! Then they want to insult you by charging you $2 when you actually ask for more meat!!!!! So aggravated right now!!  Have a good mind to go back up there!!!!

This is a ZERO STAR review.  Awful service. There is no pride in food prep or service here. Would you serve garlic knots that were completely CHARRED and burnt to your guests? One of the few guests, I might add, who is trying to support you and keep your sorry ass in business!!!!  It is so sad!!  No wonder there are only two customers ever in there at one time...

I thought the food was wonderful.  We Ordered Brussels sprouts, smothered in bacon bits, topped with a fried egg....scrumptious.  Also had the pork sandwich with golf ball sized tater tots, filled with amazing flavors.  ( I am a loser and can't remember what  was actually in them, but they were amazing!) The food here is great . They don't have diet coke , but they carry regular coke products in a little glass bottle at $3 each. Bartender claims the owners do not  carry diet coke because it contains  fructose corn syrup.. Seriously! You FRY Brussels sprouts and smother them with BACON for crying out loud!!!  I (unfortunately)  NEED diet coke with savory food.  Sorta like wine and cheese for some. I tried an ice tea and it was so bland, tasted like water. So knowing I wasn't happy with my drink options, (diet coke or diet coke) the bartender (we sat at the bar) gave me room temperature tap water, containing a single ice cube which quickly melted.  Eww.   She could have at least dressed the water glass up with a pile of ice and a fruit wedge of some sort, after all, It was 111 de- freakin grees outside!!! She's amateur, it was obvious.  But the food was  delicious and so this place still gets five stars.  BUT, IF I ever decide to return,  I'd smuggle in my own diet cokes or else I couldn't eat here.  SAD! but it's the way it is.  Also, weird/small selection of beer my husband wasn't happy with, he asked for a chilled glass for his CAN of beer, and the "bartender" offered him a can cuzzy, cozy, whatever the hell you call it  instead. NOT OK!!! AND the pickles have a funky taste.  I better stop talking or I'll be changing my five star review. Oh! And they have weird hours.

Coming in to exchange a few things  my husband didn't love. I purchased them without him being with me and so today,  we came back together so he could pick out what he wanted. The manager was very rude. (40091).  Once I was paying for the $150 shirt , $118 shirt, $148 sweater and the $98 shirt, she was very short and snotty with me about the exchange.  I think I will not come to this location anymore when 40091 is working.

Pacinos is having an identity crisis. Using Osaka Blues brewery glasses from Colorado for beer. Smells like cleaning fluid instead of yummy Italian food, bartender eating behind the bar. Phantom musician has the keyboard set up , but is nowhere to be found, just like every other time we have ever been here. Good owners, good hardworking people, put all their money and time into this investment, it it just too bad they are stuck in the conundrum of figuring it all out. People wanna be where it's "cool" to be. Make it warm cozy and comfortable, it is too sterile in here. Put some  Wood wainscoting on the walls, some heavy drapery, again, lower the lighting, put candles on the tables, the bartender is eating a full meal behind the bar, sure there are only 6 people in here, but you can't stop performing just because the crowd is small. Bring us over a few fresh ravioli, make us want to call our friends up and have them meet us down here because we are having such a good time. Engage us. Do something, do anything!

Ate here for the fourth time today in a few months.  It was perfect. Every table was full the entire two hours we were there. A great mix of people and a great "chill" vibe to the atmosphere.  Awesome music playing at just the right volume. Civeche is awesome, so is the Lola salad and pork tacos.  Had a great time.

Our initial experience with Mr Sparky wasn't that productive.  We were not 100% satisfied with the service we received, but paid the technician the "flat"  fee that he charged us, even though they didn't complete the work requested.  It was the end of a business day so, we figured we would just speak with the manager the next business day.  (The following Monday.) We left a message with the manager on Friday, late afternoon.  The manager, Daniel, called us first thing Monday morning and rectified the situation promptly and professionally. We were very happy with Daniel and how he handled the situation.  I will say that if we use Mr. Sparky in the future, that I will feel more comfortable doing so, knowing they will stand behind their word and their guarantee.

Gee L. You are spot on with your review. For all the people whining about not being able to buy the floor model; There's more than 500 people a day who frequent this store, who apparently  think they are the only people on this planet who have serious first world problems and NEED the furniture right this minute. Yeah, the salespeople get irritated when the 510th person of the day demands the floor sample because they must be satisfied RIGHT NOW! Stores do not sell FLOOR MODELS, because they are FLOOR MODELS SO PEOPLE CAN SEE IT AND KNOW IF THEY WANT TO BUY IT.  If everyone was allowed to buy the floor model, the store would be empty and there would be no "SHOWROOM" then people would get angry that "This store is this big and they don't even have a sample of the dresser I want!" THE NERVE! Salespeople also have goals set forth by the management, sometimes their work schedule is based around whether or not they are meeting their goals.   When a customer comes in, a particular "salesperson is "up" so when they follow you around, please try to have some sympathy for another regular person, (just like yourself) because, let's face it, unless you are shopping at Restoration Hardware, with money wads in your pocket, or having your designer shop for you, YOU, my friend are a regular person PROBABLY in sales yourself. So lay off the poor salesperson, who is just trying to do his or her job correctly.   If you want to browse, be honest and say to the salesperson, "I am just looking right now, but I promise, when I am Ready to buy, I will come and ask for you by name".  This will get them off of your back and still leave them with their dignity.   Also, delivery cost money.  When a driver goes on a delivery, there is gas, truck maintenance, insurance, liability etc etc, that  goes into that delivery that a simple minded customer who complains about delivery isn't considering. If you want it so bad and don't want to pay the delivery fee, then pick it up yourself.

Just ate some lunch at Sunnyside Breakfast Lounge, it was very good. I went with the intention of ordering breakfast, but couldn't resist the muffuletta sandwich. Not a real New Orleans style muffuletta sandwich, but it was still good.  I sorta feel like there are two sandwiches in the world that if you can't do them right, you should not do them at all. One of those sandwiches is the fried Monte Cristo and the other sandwich is the Muffuletta sandwich.   So, although it was good, it could be better. :) My daughter ordered the Sunnyside chicken panini. Both items were really good, nice sized portions and nice presentation.  We both had leftovers.  The staff was uber friendly and the chef came out to ask how our food was. Every staff member came by at one point to make sure we were well taken care of.  The next time we go I want to try a mixologist juice drink and those Nutella pancakes!  I made a comment when I checked in, saying that  I hated the brightly colored pleather booths, but after I sat there for awhile, they grew on me. But I still don't love them.  Our waitress was very sweet and it was apparent she wanted us to be very happy with our food and the service. I will go back soon. So happy to have a breakfast place close to home, "Nestled in the Las Sendas Mountains" ....as the menu states.

Very unique experience. Agnes, (or Alex, I see different names in the reviews regarding the owner) the owner and chef,  is very much involved in the front of house as well as being the chef. We had the Germany,  Mexico, Europa and the Italian crepes.  All were very good and completely different. The Mexico was the most visually appealing with its vibrant colors.  Although,my husband ordered it with chicken and NO TOMATOES , it was served with beef and lots of tomatoes. He didn't say anything and ate the beef and picked out the tomatoes.  Not sure what was going through Agnes's head while making his crepe, but she seems the type to let you order what you "think" you want and ends up giving you what she thinks you should have, she had that kinda personality going on, but she was really into the food and very proud of her menu. You can tell she loves her business and really is involved on every level. The fresh brewed ice tea was delicious, it is $6.50 for a carafe, so it should be good. The atmosphere was really cute and you could totally wear your Valentino messenger here and fit right in. (Which I did)

Can't make a Harvey Walbanger! WHAAAA!!!! It's a chic drink mixology joint. Get the ingredients for crying out LOUD!    My DAD has Gallianio for crying out LOUD!  Vodka, GALLIANIO AND ORANGE JUICE.  But it was still a great joint. I'll give it seven out of five stars this time only cause we had a delicious dinner at Cafe Monarch and we are all in a great mood!!   The "bees Knees" is different and  peculiar for sure!  The Tom Collins was alright. I had a diet coke since I am the designated driver. I want to try the butter cake, but no one else does.:(

We came looking for this place SPECIFICALLY because we saw it on YELP.  Well, after spending an hour looking for it, we found out  via the FEDEX guy, who saw us walking around in circles, that it is now CLOSED. There is a new store located in the space.  It is CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED.. Or it has moved, whatever, it ain't here at this address.

I love this place. Trainers are really genuine and want to help you succeed in your weight loss goals. I have been a member since November 2014. I Love the online sign in option, and flexible classes. I love that they added a 90 minute class.  The times flues, but you feel so amazing and powerful after the class is over.  I love the visual aide with the heart monitor and follow up email of my workout stats. Keeps me motivated. Great business concept.

What's with the constant talking trainers. Talking doesn't motivate me, music does. Give me the motivational cues and then hush up. I left class early tonight because all that talking through a microphone  gave me a headache. Still love this place, trying to not be rude.

Flies! Undercooked burger AGAIN, not to mention it was so greasy! I had to pat it with napkins several times and I couldn't eat most of it because it was undercooked. I asked for well done and it was so red in the center. And the Flies! Five guys is better than is place. Cheese fries $7, they were cold and smothered in cheese. They should be piping hot and crispy with a cheese drizzle. The flies were the biggest issue for me, they flew around me the whole time I ate. $50 for two burgers, one basket of  fries, a tea and a beer. Not worth it.  Plus.  Not sure I like looking at Bessie the cow in 3-d while I eat her brother or cousin. Seriously though, I think five guys, for the money, puts out a better product and you don't have to tip 20% on a bad meal.

Sitting in the Tranquility area waiting for my appointment.  I WISH the staff would make it a point to tell guests to keep their big voices DOWN while walking in and out of the TRANQUILITY room.   Also, therapists, is it really necessary to ask every client after treatment if they have to go to the bathroom?! Don't you think people of the age to go get a massage by themselves are capable of knowing if they have to go potty or not? You could say "restrooms are located down the hall to the left," and leave it at that.  Argh. Anyway, let me get back to my tranquility.
