We bought a package deal that cost over $2,200.  The plants and trees that we bought 2 years ago have almost all died or failed to grow.  We have 2 mesquite trees that have NEVER grown and now one of them just died after plenty of water and fertilizer (Moon Dust).  The biggest tree they selected for us had a double trunk that split during a wind storm even though they had staked the tree (improperly it would appear).  The ground cover they selected for us were quickly eaten by rabbits, squirrels and chipmunks.  They should have asked us about what wildlife we have around our home and helped select plants that they would not have been attracted to as much and given us tips on how to protect our plants.  They also planted a small palm tree crooked so it looks funny.  Out of 5 large desert willow trees, 3 of them are growing nicely but the two that we needed to grow the most to block the view of our neighbors have not grown nearly as much.  All trees have been equally cared for, watered and fertilized so I think these 2 trees were inferior.  Out of over 30 plants they are the ONLY 3 I am remotely happy with.  I feel like I ended up paying $700/tree instead of getting a great deal for the price we paid for a lot of trees and plants which are mostly dead or not growing.  We asked their advice about what would create a hedge that required low water and grow quickly.  They recommended hop bushes.  9 of them died in the first year (after the warranty) and the 3 remaining have not grown.  DO NOT buy from them.  They do not back up their plants and sell plants that die and don't grow, Lowe's and Home Depot have better warranties!

The sushi is amazing.  It is made daily in the store by an authentic sushi chef.  The rolls are more beautiful and delictable than in most actual sushi restaurants.  Pricing is good too, 12 piece brown rice spicy tuna for $7.99 beats most happy hour pricing and the really fancy rolls are typically $8-$10.    The produce selection is broad as well including an all organic section.  They also match competitor coupons.  I use the $3 of off $30 from Fresh and Easy when I go there.  They also have good prices on wine (larger selection than some wine stores)

Great specials, they keep bringing out newer, healthier prepared food options.  Half price bread lasts about a week after I buy it.   The girl doing the sampling really wants people to try and like what they are sampling.  Very friendly staff.  There are items that TJs and Walmart don't have so I shop all 3 as needed but F and E is a twice a week place for me to go in quick, grab fresh salad food and fruit and get out.  I spend as much time driving around and parking at Walmart (101 and Raintree) as I do in F and E.
