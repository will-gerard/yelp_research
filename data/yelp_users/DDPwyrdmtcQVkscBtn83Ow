I can't believe I have not written a review for Pita!! I love Pita Jungle, I have tried several different items off their menu, and have NEVER been disappointed.  I prefer this location rather than the one in Ahwatukee because I like the smaller feel of this location.  The staff is always friendly, and the service is always pretty quick.  I also like this location because you can sit on the patio by the little late which is nice for 'Date Night" :)   I would definitely get hummus while you're there.  I love their wraps, my boyfriend just had their Kafta burger the other night which was awesome, you can't go wrong with a salad, and I have had a chicken dish from their and also a mahi mahi burger before which was bomb.   Definitely try the caramelized cauliflower while you're there too, because it is fantastic.  I can only have a couple of pieces, so I recommend sharing with your table as an appetizer.  Their green tea is to die for as well.   All in all I recommend pita to anyone! I am on a strict diet, but still find myself at Pita every now and then :)

My boyfriend and I have been to El Zocalo a few times.  It is in downtown Chandler, and our fave spot is San Tan Brewery, but it is difficult to get into, and sometimes we just want a good margarita.  We are definitely fans of Tequila.   If you have a chance, check out the patio, it is absolutely gorgeous out there when the weather is nice.  Its a nice large patio.  The night that we went we were hoping to get some good Happy Hour specials, and upon arrival (10-15min before 6) we were seated instantly, but I was kind of annoyed with the fact that it seemed to take the waiter awhile to get to us, which mankes me think they are hoping we miss  happy hour.  When we asked our waiter what was on special it was literally one drink, and an app. Kinda sucky for a Mexican place on a Friday night.  Needless to say that was disappointing.   However, our margaritas were really good, he had a more "authentic" margarita, not too sweet which is what he prefers, and mine was perfect for me.  Complimentary chips with our drinks, and then we left.  I personally have never eaten  here, so I can't attest to their food, but everything I have seen looks good.   Overall, cute atmosphere, and the margaritas are good, but can be pricey.  I hate when they don't put the price on their menu, I instantly think they are priced too high.

I am not a virgin to tattoos.  I had 4 already before coming into No Regrets.  While I dont have extremely large pieces, I have some knowledge on the process.  My sister went to No Regrets for her first and only tattoo, and this past weekend my mom wanted to get her second.  We went into No Regrets with no appointment (it was a quick and easy tattoo) and saw Jessica.  Whoa she is awesome.  Not that this has anything to do with her work, shes super cool, and she has a really neat style.  She had great lines, and was super friendly.    Being in the shop, made me get the itch for a new one myself, I had one in mind I knew I wanted to get, wasnt sure on placement, so left that day but went back the next day.  Requested Jessica, walked in and she was working on a large sleeve, so I came back a few hours later and she was ready for me.  The girl that helps her out is super cool too.  It was pretty funny, a group of about 6 girls walked in wanting to get the same tattoo (probably some friendship thing) and were trying to haggle with them, it was entertaining.  They were wearing swimsuits only so I found it kind of ridiculous.    Anyways I got the outline of Arizona, I was in and out quickly and it came out awesome.  While I have a few tattos, I havent found someone I love yet to complete future work ( I'm feeling a half sleeve) until meeting Jessica.  She told me to look her up on Instagram and she has some really amazing drawings.  I personally felt we meshed, she likes bikes (Harleys) and wants to learn to ride like me! I will definitely be following her art, and hopefully back to her for more work!! I loved her!  Highly recommended.  Shop is clean, and staff was really cool, at least everyone I came in contact with.

This is hands down my boyfriend and I's favorite spot in Chandler... Actually... ANYWHERE.  We absolutely LOVE San Tan Brewery and are there almost weekly.  I always joke with him saying that one day we will have our rehearsal dinner there.  I can not say one bad thing about this place.  I walk in and it seems like people recognize us, that's when you know things are good!   San Tan becomes more packed everytime I go in, but I love that they do so well!  They are very casual, loud, and a bar setting.  Don't walk in expecting to get a Bud Light, or Miller Light.  My fave beers are the Epicenter and Hefe.  I have ordered so many different food items off the menu but my recent fave is the Pork Pabil.. Its amazing.    You will never go wrong with San Tan Fries... they are the best fries I have ever had.  All the servers are awesome, I have never had bad service from anyone there.  The bar tenders are great, and always make you feel like you are the only person at the bar.  This place is awesome for groups, or a casual date.  We bring out parents all the time and they love it just as much as we do.

Ive been to Loco once when it wasn't a Tuesday, but other than that I only go on Tuesday Nights... and by only, I mean every Tuesday.  My family and I go to Loco every Tuesday.  Kelsey and one other lady (im sorry I forget your name) are always our waitress.  Kelsey is awesome, I want to be friends with her! ha!  They always remember what we order.  I used to always get a margarita (one of the best frozen margaritas I have had at a restaurant) until I went on a health kick.  The atmosphere is awesome, they owners are always there checking in with people, and everyone is super friendly.  Tuesday nights are packed, luckily we get there early.    Food: I always have chicken, steak and fish tacos! Ha! I don't mess around.  Chicken tacos are $1 on Tuesdays, steak and fish are $2.  What a deal!! I have also had their wings, which are phenomenal at a Mexican restaurant! Definitely try their pretzel sticks at least once with the queso, also another fave!   Loco gets loud on Tuesday, everyone is there for a good time!! This place is great for families, since its in Ahwatukee.  And the service is fantastic!  Can't speak for any other nights, but Tuesday is definitely Poppin!

Pink Polish is AMAZING! The only reason why I am putting 4 stars is because I am very picky about how well my cuticles are done, and nail care before slapping on polish, and because my last pedicure the lady was a little too into her conversation with another nail tech.   However, I love this place.  I was in a bit of a pickle because my nail lady quit at the previous salon I was going to.  Found Pink Polish on Yelp, and am now obsessed.  They are a little bit more expensive then some other salons (maybe $5 or $10 more) but they definitely prove that they are of higher quality.  They are extremely clean, very large salon, nicely decorated, and the techs are clean and neat as well.    They are up to date with their designs, and have been able to do all the Pinterest ideas I have shown them.   Tip: Definitely call for an appointment.  This is not a place to just walk in.

Well, I may be a little biased about Madison Avenue, because I did used to work there, but I left on a great note.  Madison Avenue is one of the best salons in Ahwatukee, and now they have locations in Chandler, and Gilbert.  I have endless recomendations that I could made as far as people that work there, and if anyone that does work there reads this, sorry if I missed you!   One of my favorite parts of Mad Ave is the spa.  Specifically the nail spa.  I am a little bit of a nail whore, I cannot go without my nails and toes being done, and I have been spoiled by the ladies here.  Kate is a phenomenal nail tech if you can get into her.  She has done wonders for my nails, and takes the time to make sure she is doing everything PERFECTLY.  Deb C. is such a hoot, she is so fun to be around, and she really knows the best for your nails, she loves her job and it shows.   My fave aetsi there is Kelly, hands down she is the best.  I have had her do several services for me, but she does a bomb brow wax.  I get compliments on my eyebrows all the time, and can't take any credit, its all Kelly.  It's been awhile since I have been in for a skin treatment, but she is great at recommending products.    As far as stylists go, it really depends on what level you are looking for and what your hair is like.  Olivia and Kim have both given me some awesome updos, Priscilla is an all around amazing stylist.  Nicki is awesome with blondes, Liz is amazing with short hair, and I know I am missing people... :)   Mad Ave is worth the high price tag, especially if you are looking for a quality service.  They have a phenomenal selection of retail, and if anything doesn't pan out, I promise they will correct it for you.  Give them a try, all their departments are awesome.

I love sushi!! and I love all your can eat sushi for $20!! The sushi chefs here are always awesome... my boyfriend and I go and CHOW DOWN.  They have some awesome rolls, and always get them out quickly.   Hon Machi is teppan, sushi and I believe they have regular menu items like teriyaki chicken.  I can only review the sushi bar because that is all I have ever gone for. I give 4 stars because it seems like they have a high turnover on wait staff, and they always seem to be training.  After one roll they tried to take my ginger and wasabi! ha! no worries though!   So many options of rolls for the all you can eat (I wish squid salad was part of it!) I really like the tootsy roll, Arizona roll, and shrimp tempura. My boyfriend loves that nigiri is part of the all you can eat which isnt part of the happy hour.   I love this place, we go every couple of weeks.  All you can eat is Sunday-Wednesday.  I would love to try the teppan there once because people seem to enjoy it!

I'm no fitness enthusiast, but have been on a journey to change my habits for the last year and have done well at it so far, I am down 40 pounds in 2013, and continuing my journey in 2014.  My boyfriend and I joined 24 hour together, so that we could work out together.  He used to be a personal trainer, so lucky me because I get to get his expertise at the gym.  We checked out several gyms in the area and it came down to Fitness Works and 24 Hour Fitness.  We skipped out on Fitness Works (even though it was a little cheaper) because his ex works out there, and she is just a nightmare, and a jealous b.  So anyways, that brings me to 24 hour, we chose them because they literally had EVERYTHING we were both looking for in a gym.  They were extremely friendly when it came to signing up, we pay about $30 a month with no sign up fee.  I have all club access my lover does not.    24 hour offers a full length lap pool, hot tub, steam room, sauna, SEVERAL stair masters, elliptical, treadmills and bikes, a jumbo tire for flipping, ropes, kettle bells, free weights, jump ropes, weight machines, so umm basically EVERYTHING :)   The staff has been friendly, the gym and locker room is clean, at least on the ladies side, can't speak for the mens locker room, its well lit, nothing really seems to be broken, they have several tvs to watch during cardio, and I would recommend this gym to anyone.   Its not too busy, but I have been there at 530am and on the weekends.  Even being the beginning of the year, Everything I have wanted to use is available with no wait time.   Happy Working Out! :)

Seriously, this place is heaven on earth... DO NOT LEAVE after you see the wait... it is WORTH IT! Wait the 45 min to an hour, you will not be disappointed.   Definitely ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles... The waffles have bacon in them. Let me repeat myself...the WAFFLES have BACON in them.  It was seriously amazing.  My dad got the same thing as me, my mom had the Chicken Benedict... also phenomenal, and HUGE.  My sister isn't as much of an "eater" that we are, an d she opted for oatmeal with fruit... Well this was the biggest bowl of oatmeal I had EVER seen, and she was extremely satisfied.   Don't plan on finishing your food here, because it would just be near impossible, but don't split your food, its part of the experience.  The drinks are awesome as well.  Do plan on having your camera, trust you are going to want to remember the moment you ate the largest plate of chicken and waffles you have ever seen! :)

I love Leidan Mitchell, however I can't attribute it to anything other than my amazing hair stylist Jess Goldman.  Jess has been doing my hair for years now.  After working in a salon, she knows that I love to change my color and style all the time, and she totally gets me!  One day I want to be light the next I want my hair to be dark, and shes okay with it!  She has the edge, but also the class! LOVE HER!!! And its like therapy everytime I go.   The stylists do rent, so you have to call the stylist or service provider individaully.  I do love the salon because it reminds me of Cinderella with the colors.  I love that they have wine on hand, and small snacks :) They also have fresh iced tea and lemonade.  They have a great selection of Bumble and Bumble products, Kerastise, and some higher end skin care and makeup.  Its a great feel in the salon, and from what I can tell everyone there is talented! :)  I would definitely recommend.

I went last week for a massage and Kris was AWESOME!! This was probably the best massage I have ever had in my life, and I'm no newbie.  I have been running and working out a ton and have been so sore all over.  She made sure that i didn't have any injuries, and was super nice.  She also focused a lot on my legs which was AMAZING :)   When I finished the massage I went to pay, and was convinced to do their monthly membership.. Which is fine, I am training for a half, and it might be nice for the next couple of months.  I also had a gift card that I was using to pay with that day.  The reason why I am giving 4 stars is because they had already charged my card so I was charged twice for the massage.  Not a horrible problem, and they did call to fix it right away, but it is still slightly annoying.

Totally disappointed... I had to update this review, because of my extremely frustrating experience.  I had a massage scheduled for Friday, September 27th at 5:00pm.  5 is pushing it for me to get there, but I scheduled it then, so no big deal, nice to end m y week there, nice and relaxed.  So I was rushing to leave work to get there on time.  I was at Gilbert and Germann (one street away) at 5pm, gave them a quick call, and told them I would be there any minute (I understand if they had to knock 5 min off my massage).  When I called the girl at the front, she wasn't clear in saying they didn't have me down, but said there was a problem, and asked if I could see a male masseuse.  I wasn't comfortable with that, and asked what the problem was? Did they not have me scheduled?   She said they did but my masseuse had quit, and so they weren't able to accommodate me.  Again, I understand that people leave, but they NEVER called to tell me this.  They never tried to reschedule me, they never called to try to get me in with someone else.  So I was already mad, but I worked in a salon and understand that things happen.  However, the girl at the front was NOT accommodating at all. Since I was around the corner I went in to talk to them.   Upon my arrival, I informed them that I was going to cancel my membership, seeing as this was my first "official" month of the membership, and I had already been double charged, and now cancelled on with NO notice.  She said I would receive a call from Barbara the Spa Manager first thing Saturday, and they would comp my next massage.  But I have already paid, and there has been no refund as of yet, so we will see.  I waited patiently on Saturday for a phone call, I emailed Barbara on Friday asking her to call me as well, and it is now Monday, and I have heard absolutely nothing.  This is the most frustrating part of all of it to me.  This would NOT be a one star review if they had promptly called me to resolve the issue.  Now I am going to have to reach out to them.    Very disappointing, and poor poor customer service.  Hopefully they can get it together for the masseuse's sake, or they will have plenty more of them walking out the doors.  I highly suggest NOT doing their membership, save yourself the heartache.  Maybe go in for the introductory offer if you are looking for a good deal, but they aren't worth it long term.

Favorite froyo place... try the salted carmel pretzel flavor.  The staff is always awesome, prices are in line with other froyo places, lots of seating, lots of toppings (my fave is captain crunch and toasted coconut) and all around AWESOME! Sign up for their text club to get discounts!

Okay, so I used to see Brittney a lot more often, but life kind of got in the way, and I got away from it.  I recently when in for a facial with her, and am kicking myself in the butt for not going back sooner.   Brittney is SO meticulous with her clients.  She is one of those service providers that really actually does care about her clients, and her clients skin.  I think the best thing was that I had a question about my MOMS skin, sent her a quick text with a question, and she got back to me IMMEDIATELY with advice, and saying to have my mom come in for a complementary analysis/consultation so she knows what products to be u sing.    Brittney's skin room is always really really clean, she plays nice relaxing music, its always the perfect temperature, and it always smells AWESOME. She always has services that match the season, so most recently she is doing pumpkin and fall scents, and facials.  So her room always seems to match my mood.  Its awesome.   If you have a chance to get in to see her, she has really made a name for herself in her industry.  Shes super sweet, and really really awesome at her job.  She won't disappoint you, and her knowledge is unbelievable, I really think that is what sets her apart!

Erica is my girl for sure!!!   A little background on me:  I worked at a salon and day spa for about 5 years as a receptionist.  I knew everything there was to know about salon and spa services.  It was hard to leave because the girls were my family and who doesn't love free services!?  Fast Forward:  It was getting too difficult to schedule with my girlfriends, either I was canceling on them or they were canceling on me.  I had to find someone that I didn't know for my Brazilian waxes.  I found Erica on Yelp and thank God I did!!  Erica is located in a studio type salon and spa, everyone rents rooms, I believe the building is L'mage (beauty studios).  Erica's room is clean, and simple and she makes you feel so comfortable.  She strictly does waxing which is awesome, she definitely knows what she is doing.  She uses a mixture of hard wax and another wax.  She provides all her Brazilian customers with a wipe to clean yourself (which is great, everyone wants to wipe down before someone is up close and personal) and a towel to cover yourself.  She steps out of the room lets you undress and lay on the table.   Erica always keeps conversation going, has low music in the background, and is the sweetest!  As long as you keep your schedule regular she keeps her pricing at the "1st time special" which is great too for planners like me :)    Definitely go see Erica, she is the best I have had!

I'll keep it short and sweet! Great thin crust pizza, delish sangria, and cool atmosphere.   Service was decent.. took awhile to get drinks, and for him to check in on us, but maybe he was new! :)   I would recommend it for sure! :) Cute casual date night spot too!

Okay so I am basically obsessed with this place.  My friend suggested I go here, and Yelp confirmed that for me after seeing their reviews and video! Jeniza is awesome!! I used to go to Pink Polish which is another great nail salon, but felt it was pretty overpriced.  I went on Friday during a lunch break to get a pedi, I would recommend calling ahead for an appointment, however, they were able to squeeze me in for a gel mani as well.    Rose was my nail tech and she was phenomenal, she made sure I was comfortable, offered some great tips, and did a fast and efficient service.  I am always rushing from one place to the next it seems like, and as much as everyone loves a 1 hour pedicure and 1 hour nail service, I don't have time for that, but don't want to jeopardize the service.  So I felt like I got a quick service, and it was done to my picky standards.  And at a perfect price for my tight budget.  I love having my nails done, I basically can't live without them done, and I need somewhere that I can afford.   I loved the decor, the nail bar, and the pedi station, and I loved how quaint it was inside.  I hate going into a HUGE overcrowded business.    Needless to say, I have made the switch to Jeniza, its nice and close to work, and on my way home, and Rose is my new nail tech.  Everyone speaks english, and they don't talk about you to their neighbor, which is nice.  I would definitely recommend this nail spot, and Rose.  I already made my next appt! :)

I am not from Chicago, and I have never been or heard of Portillo's until my boyfriend told me about them.  We made the ride out to Scottsdale because he was craving some crinkle cut cheese fries (which are fantastic!)  He had a beef sandwich which looked phenomenal, and I totally messed up and ordered a grilled chicken sandwich.  My sandwich was good, but a place called Portillo's Hot Dogs, and I get a chicken sandwich?? I can't wait to go back so I can try a hot dog, and do it right.  However, I did get the cheese fries, only regret is that I didn't get a bigger size ;) Service is good, atmosphere is fun, and I love the 50's music they play! The restaurant is absolutely HUGE, and I can't wait to visit the new Tempe location.

This place is AUH-MAZE-ING!!! My boyfriend and I will occasionally go on motorcycle rides, and we decided to make a stop at the Original Breakfast House this weekend.  We went because of the reviews that we saw on Yelp.  When you go, get there Pancakes... HOLY SMOKES they were the most fluffy, most delicious pancakes I have ever had.  They have a hint of lemon in them, and I am bound and determined to recreate these since we live in Chandler and can't come here EVERY weekend.  I can promise you though that we will be back.   I also don't remember out servers name, but she was the genuinely nicest person that I have ever dealt with.  My boyfriend and I typically have something to say about our servers that we don't like, but we couldn't find ANYTHING wrong with her, she was so sweet, I wish I knew her name to give her a shout out.  And shout out the the owners for having a super clean restaurant and from what I could see kitchen too!  All in all... make the drive, go eat here, it is awesome, and inexpensive.  Definitely get their pancakes  :)

My Pure Barre review is my first review!  I started Pure Barre about a week ago, and am completely obsessed.  I have never been so sore and wanted to keep going back!  I have taken 5 classes so far, and feel so much better about myself.  All the instructors I have had so far are awesome, they come around fix your form, and encourage you every step of the way.  Not one class I have taken has been the same yet.  You can expect to work the same areas, but definitely not in a repetitive way which I LOVE!  When you first walk into Pure Barre there is a front desk on your right, and a small retail area with Pure Barre merchandise which include hats, tops, and some other brands too.  Everyone is decked out in the cutest workout gear which I love!  We are women, we want to feel good all the time.   I know when I first went I had to go to work after so I wasn't sure if there was a locker room.  Heads up lady, no locker room, but it definitely doesn't make a difference to me.  They have a nice bathroom, cubbies for your personal belongings, and a water station.    Note for Newbies:  No shorts in class, capris or pants only.  Definitely bring water with you, you will sweat a lot!  Wear socks, or buy the Pure Barre socks there.  You definitely won't regret starting at Pure Barre, but be prepared to be addicted!!

I'm writing this review for my mom.  She absolutely loves The Hub!  She was a long time member of a regular boring box gym that will go unnamed.  She is a very avid runner, but would occasionally go to boxing and other classes.  She was really tired of the same old routine at the gym, every class she went to was the same, and she slowly stopped going as much.  She was wondering why she wasnt adding as much muscle, and it was because she wasnt going enough.  She wanted more of a challenge and she definitely found it at The Hub.   She is always so excited to tell me about her workouts.  She said she is sore again from working out and in a good way.  She takes a class called Hybrid, but I believe they also offer some other options like Yoga, and Kids Fitness.  She loves how welcoming everyone is and how hard everyone is willing to work when they are there.  They do some individual exercises in the group class, and they sometimes have team challenges, like holding up a giant tire and walking it around the building.  She is doing exercises that she sees trainers do on TV and is LOVING it!   All ages come her from what she tells me, male and female.  From what she is telling me I am going to have to check it out, and it sounds like anyone that is tired of their boring routine should too!  She gives this place 5 stars, and wants everyone to know about it, so I thought I would help her out since she doesnt have her own account.

I have known the owners of this salon since I was in High School... They are the nicest people in the world! They used to work over at Miracle Nails, but now own Spectrum.  Its a little difficult to find, but its a beautiful clean salon.  They do an awesome job, and have all the gel colors and glitter.  Its a super reasonable price for their services, and they have new comfortable pedi chairs.   I would definitely check them out if I were you, they treat you like family, and do a great job.  Its next to Goodwill in Ahwatukee and where Dance Depot and Barros used to be.  They are quick, efficient, and affordable.

This place is terrible.  I have to start off by saying that I am not a member at this gym, but I wanted to be... I read from a fellow  Yelper that you could use the cardio and weights for $10 a month.  I wasn't sure if this was just a promotion so I attempted SEVERAL times to reach out to Spectrum.  I email them through their website a couple of times, and I also found an email on their facebook page.  After attempting to send at least 4 emails that warrented no response, I thought maybe commenting through their Facebook page would get them to respond.  I simply stated "does no one return emails from Spectrum Fitness"  Of course since this was out for the world to see, they quickly commented "we haven't recieved any of your emails except the one you just sent" amazing how the email started to work!!  I inquired about their memberships, since I belong to Pure Barre, I just want somewhere to run indoors.  They told me that they had a basic membership, for $9.99/ month a $49 enrollment fee and a $39.99 annual fee.  Annual fees are all of a sudden part of memberships at gyms, find I'll pay my annual dues, but we all know enrollment fees are just a way to collect more money from me.  Collect it from the people that dont use their memberships.  They also had a premier membership $20 a month with some other fees.  On their website they say they will waive enrollement ifyou bring in your old gym key tag!  Perfect I was going to switch gyms!  When i inquired about this, he said only if I bring in a coupon... no where online does it say I have to bring in a coupon.  When asking about this I got NO RESPONSE.  I emailed them again saying exactly what I wanted out of my membership, take it or leave it.  I then got a response saying that they can't remove the annual fee.... NOT WHAT I WAS ASKING! Thanks for not answering my questions correctly.  I haven't heard anything from the last two emails that I sent so I then decided I was over it.    What a joke this place is.  Unlike Facebook they can't remove my review on Yelp.  People should be warned this place does not have it together!!! Don't waste your time with a management team that could care less that you are there, but just want to collect a bunch of BS fees.  I wish I could have given 0 stars to Spectrum or Evolution or whatever this place is called!

I inquired about their memberships, since I belong to Pure Barre, I just want somewhere to run indoors.  They told me that they had a basic membership, for $9.99/ month a $49 enrollment fee and a $39.99 annual fee.  Annual fees are all of a sudden part of memberships at gyms, find I'll pay my annual dues, but we all know enrollment fees are just a way to collect more money from me.  Collect it from the people that dont use their memberships.  They also had a premier membership $20 a month with some other fees.  On their website they say they will waive enrollement ifyou bring in your old gym key tag!  Perfect I was going to switch gyms!  When i inquired about this, he said only if I bring in a coupon... no where online does it say I have to bring in a coupon.  When asking about this I got NO RESPONSE.  I emailed them again saying exactly what I wanted out of my membership, take it or leave it.  I then got a response saying that they can't remove the annual fee.... NOT WHAT I WAS ASKING! Thanks for not answering my questions correctly.  I haven't heard anything from the last two emails that I sent so I then decided I was over it.    What a joke this place is.  Unlike Facebook they can't remove my review on Yelp.  People should be warned this place does not have it together!!! Don't waste your time with a management team that could care less that you are there, but just want to collect a bunch of BS fees.  I wish I could have given 0 stars to Spectrum or Evolution or whatever this place is called!  **After dealing with Quan at Spectrum, he then told me "oh you are confused we are Fitness Evolution now" even though he knew I was referring to WHATEVER the name of the gym is... But change your facebook, change your email, and send people to your new website, then you can avoid POOR POOR customer service and confusion.  I guarentee I am not the only person to be confused, MAKE IT MORE CLEAR!

I will start by saying I'm the absolute worst when it comes to writing timely reviews, but I have to say that Monica is an absolute joy to work with!  I found her while searching on yelp because I did not know a realtor to work with. So lucky I stumbled across her.   My husband and I worked with Monica before moving from Arizona to Maryland when we thought we were going to be staying in the area and needed a place together and not separate homes.  Monica is extremely professional, and makes the home buying experience one that smooth and easy instead of stressful and a headache.  She showed us several amazing homes, and really understood what we were looking for.   My only complaint is that my husband ended up getting a job outside of Arizona and we had to move out of state and didn't get to use her to her full potential.   I would highly recommend Monica to anyone in the area, you will absolutely not be disappointed.     Oh and enjoy the process! She makes it easy to do so!
