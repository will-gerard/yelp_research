As a native here in Arizona, I know to stay out of the sun! I don't want to look like a wrinkled up old lady, however I love the look of a golden tan. I tried the automatic spray tanning beds, YIKES is all I have to say!! I looked scary!! Thankfully I found Michele. She is a true professional, I felt totally comfortable and she was able to customize my tan so it looked natural! I looked sun kissed :D which is difficult with my Irish skin...I looked 10 lbs lighter YAY! I'm so excited to have found her!

I took my yellow lab in to banfield a few months ago, he was needing to go to the bathroom often. I thought as a precaution to take him in to make sure he didnt have a bladder infection. Of course from the get go I was PUSHED heavily into joining the insurance plan. The tech then informed me that to hold him  down in the back to perform tests it would be a 20$ fee plus the cost of the test...please!! he is a goofy yellow lab. Then the tech informed me that he would need additional tests that would be 400$+ and a another 20$ to hold him down. I was told if I signed up for the insurance it would take care of some of the costs for that day...and my dog would be covered for additional test the following day. Which it didn't!! I paid another 450$ the following day. The person who signed me up for the insurance was off the next day of course!! Bottom line~ there was nothing wrong with my dog and now they are calling me to collect for insurance. Which I'm disputing ... STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!
