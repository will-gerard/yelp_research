Wow. I've been in this airport a lot, but only for connecting flights. I've never gone through security here before. I live in OKC and love our sweet little airport, but departing from Sky Harbor, I now appreciate how well-designed and thoughtfully considered our airport is.   So, here are just a few things that I think need a serious overhaul:  -They didn't check my ID as I went into the line for TSA. They only looked at my boarding pass. This is weird, because it seems to me this is the one place where you have enough control to make sure you check every single person's ID against the name on the boarding pass.   -The lines for security are whack. You pick from one of three lines, which we will call A, B and C that feed to two people, who we will call right and left. Well, left is not only pulling from A, she's also pulling from D, the pre-approved frequent travelers who use a different line. Then you have right taking from C. No one is taking from B, which unfortunately was the line I was in. Other travelers clearly saw that we had been there for a while. When the third person who arrived after us breezed through without regard, I finally got pushy and spoke up. Why not have one line that feeds into the next available agent?   -The bag scanning line is built around a 90-degree angle, so you have to move your bags several times. There is also not much room to line up so you can't work very far ahead of your exact turn to walk through, so you waste a lot of time standing in line when you could be prepping your bins. It also seems like it would be safer in general if the agents could look down a long line and see what's happening. A lady walked through the scanner before she had pushed her bag up onto the ramp, and I felt really weird. I didn't want to move it, because it's not mine and if there is something bad in there I don't want to be seen touching it. But the alternative is to risk watching someone leave a bag behind. I had to get an agent but that took some work.   -I actually overheard the woman doing the body scan say, "I'm doing the bare minimum today." Somehow that is not comforting to me.   - Finally, when you arrive at the crowded gate area to board your flight, they have rows 1-5 line up at the same time, with groups snaking over into each other's lines. It was at this point that someone came over to check my ID against my boarding pass. There's no way of knowing you really checked everyone at this point. Plus you're weaving your way through five lines of people, weighted down by bags, who have to find their IDs again. It's just weird.   I'll keep OKC's streamlined, thoughtful procedures and nice staff any day.

What a fun little joint this is! During my recent stay at Hotel Valley Ho, I was able to check out this bar on two separate occasions. One evening we enjoyed the happy hour cocktails while enjoying the lively ambience of the patio. Our sweet server even brought us out an extra cocktail when a spare one had been made at the bar.   On the second night, some colleagues and I shared a bottle of wine in the lobby after an evening out on the town. It was such a fun and low-key place on a Tuesday night at 9 or 10 pm. I'm there are many times when this place is absolutely riotous, but it was the perfect speed for me to catch up with colleagues from all over the continent. I think the bar is one of the very best parts of staying in this hotel! Have your last drink (or two) just steps from your room? Yes, please!

I loved every aspect of my recent stay at HVH! Is it weird that I had the Jetson's theme song stuck in my head most of the trip? From the moment you pull up, you feel like you're inside someone's idea of the future. From the mid-century furniture to the color palette, you're inside a Sirkian melodrama for sure.   Until, that is, you arrive in your nicely appointed room and see the updated rooms with huge soaking tubs, glass showers, a veritable wall of mirrors and a nice flat screen. In my room, the patio doors opened onto a veranda with nice outdoor furniture, and provided a healthy dose of Scottsdale sunshine right inside my room.   Well-stocked minibar and snacks, and a wonderful in-room dining menu rounded out a perfect stay. Every interaction I had with any member of the staff here was tops, and the pool areas are gorgeous. A lively outdoor patio bar scene made me feel like I was right in the middle of something really fun, and the in-room continental breakfast I had on my last morning was worth every penny.

After trying in vain to get a drink at the Rusty Spur, we found our way to Pattie's and I'm glad we did. There was enough room for our fairly large group to break off into several groups:   1) Those who want to sit at the bar and visit in a group  2) Those who want to sit at a table and gossip with one other person  3) Those who don't want to talk and just want to play games and have fun.   The bartenders were helpful and fun, and the drinks were made quickly and properly and weren't too expensive. The volume and the speed of the place was just right for us. We all had fun, and I'm not the list bit ashamed to say Bella and Jennie and I closed the place down. We left when they turned on the lights, so I think it's safe to say I had a good time at Pattie's.

I was lucky enough to get to eat here during a quick trip to Scottsdale for work last month. Side note: I think everyone should get to take a work trip to Scottsdale sometime. It seems like the best city in the country for a work trip!   The Mission had two private tables set up on the outdoor patio. The outdoor fireplace was a big hit with our crowd. We started with wonderful chips and delicious, fresh guacamole. I truly could have sat there and eaten nothing but guacamole all night and been happy as a clam, but they just kept bringing out delicious food. We had a Taco Tuesday menu that consisted of several different tacos. The beef was my favorite, because I loved the cut of the meat (skirt) and the flavor of the seasonings. I also got to try the chicken and the pork shoulder tacos, but the steak stood out to me.   The margaritas were plentiful and so delicious. They just kept coming, and we kept drinking them. I think some other people ordered specialty cocktails, but I'll always have the margarita when dining Mexican, especially at a such a renowned place as the Mission.  I will definitely come back here next time I'm in Scottsdale, which I hope is sometime very soon.

We had a wonderful meal at Crudo last week, which was a set menu with cocktail pairings. The decor and the staff were pitch perfect, once we found the place tucked in the back of the shopping center. Ours was a set menu for a special event, which it seems to me they must to on the regular as they had it down pat.   The first course was an albacore crudo with green apples and black garlic, which was paired with a vodka cocktail with celery juice and lime. I loved the crisp drink against the buttery albacore, and black garlic is a new one for me!   The second course was my favorite, both food and drink.  Burratta with marinated tomatoes, pimentos and garlic, served inside a mason jar, with grilled french bread on the side. This was served with a cognac cocktail with cardamom, grapefruit and lemon. I love burratta, and there aren't many places in Oklahoma who serve it, so I only get to have it when I'm traveling.   The third course was beef brisket with pork sugo in a creamy polenta, paired with Buffalo Trace bourbon with Cointreau and orange bitters. I loved the cocktail, and I enjoyed the dish. My only concern with the dish was my brisket seemed to have even more fat than brisket normally has. But there was so much food, and the dish was so rich, I wasn't unhappy at all to simply side those pieces over to the side and not eat them. If that had been my main entree, I might have taken exception to it.   I'd love to come back here and check out the full menu and see it full of beautiful people on a busy Friday or Saturday night.
