Dr. Whiting is by far the best dentist I have ever seen. I went to a dentist that was closer to my home and the dentist was not able to do a satisfactory job installing my new crown. After about a year the crown fell out. Dr. Whiting and his team were able to make me a new crown and it has been perfect. My wife referred me to him saying he was the best and I am glad I went. We like him so much we switched our kids to him as well.

I love the chips and salsa here. The servers here are always prompt and they have great food, big portions for leftovers, and very reasonably priced. We have been here multiple times and will keep giving them our business.

I love Garcias. This location is great because there is never a wait and everyone is very nice. I always get the 3 combo plate for $12 with a chile relleno (they make the best rellenos), a pork burrito and chicken burrito. I eat the relleno while I am there and the other two burritos the next day. Its a ton of food for a very good price.

Urias did a great job at a reasonable price. Will definitely use again.

SimonMed, change your policy for X-rays. Having to wait 1-2 hours because you only accept walk-ins is seriously ridiculous. People work and can't spend all day because of poor planning on your part.

DO NOT PURCHASE A PREPAID DETAIL FROM THIS LOCATION. Took my vehicle here for a car wash and salesman was pushing a detail package which I explained that I did not have the time to sit for two hours and wait for my vehicle. He reassured me that they are really slow right now because of the monsoon and I could bring my vehicle back anytime if I were to prepay the detail that day. I agreed and the next Saturday called at 2:30 pm (They close at 6pm) to see if there was time for me to bring my car in just to be on the safe side. The person that answered the phone said they were no longer accepting prepaid customers for that day. I explained that the sales rep said I could bring it back anytime and asked if it would be best that I bring it back next Saturday morning.  She explained that I could but I would have to leave my vehicle there all day because I prepaid. I asked if I could then schedule an appointment and she said no that it was first come first serve for prepaid customers. So basically if I were to drive down there right now and buy a new detail package they would be able to get it done but since they already took my money they are treating me as if I am less than the customer that does not prepay. I usually only write positive reviews on Yelp and if I have had a negative experience I try to give the business the benefit of doubt but after reading other negative reviews involving the same bad business practice I feel the consumer needs to be warned.

Love the food. Service in the drive-thru is slow but I haven't had food poisoning after eating here so that is a plus.

Frio Mio is great. They have a large selection and have a xbox to play while there. Owner is super nice along with his staff. Prices are very reasonable and they offer discounts to kids wearing their sports uniform.

I have been going here since this location opened. They have new equipment and I never have to wait for a treadmill or elliptical machine since they have so many.  Also you can't beat $10 a month with no contract.

This place is really good, they offer huge burritos at a very good price.  Their se√±or burrito is so big it needs two huge tortillas and its less than $8. It can feed 3 adults.

The food is good. My wife really liked the fish. Service was average but we went on a Friday night when the first opened.

Ate dinner around 6pm on Saturday. We were seated right away. Our waiter (Tyler) was very knowledgable and quick. We ordered the shrimp cakes for an appetizer and they were delicious. They also provide bread and a herb seasoned butter.

Food was okay. They did not have some of the items listed on menu. The service was good and they gave us a free pie which was very good as well.

I really wish my experience at Zipps was good, (I would have even been satisfied with average) but unfortunately it was miserable! We started with chips, salsa, and guacamole. The salsa and guacamole were very bland, and the chips tasted stale. My wife ordered a chop salad with chicken. She said it was the worst salad she has ever ordered! (and she orders salad a lot!) The chicken was rubbery (like it had been cooked in the microwave) and had no flavor, just rubbery texture. About half of the lettuce was extremely soggy. (I'm guessing the salsa that came on the salad had been sitting for too long on the lettuce... yuck!) We also ordered a burger, a kids meal, and a cheese pizza (which our waitress forgot to put in the order.) We received the salad, the kids meal and my burger, and no pizza. Mistakes happen, but when they do I feel the waitstaff should do their best to compensate for their mistake. We were offered nothing. She did ask if we still wanted the pizza? Maybe she thought the two members of our party that ordered the pizza wanted to starve? I tried the pizza, I wish I wouldn't have. It tasted like a pizza you make from a kit in a box. The onion rings that came with my burger were awful! They were lukewarm, and the coating on the outside was chewy. (I have eaten quite a few onion rings in my lifetime, and I've never had an order with a chewy coating. Disgusting!) It's almost like the temp of the fryer was not hot enough, or they had been sitting for too long. My burger was fine. This experience goes down as the second worst meal I've ever had to pay for.

Jeremy and team did an excellent job. I was concerned about the process and was surprised everything went so smoothly. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to buy a home.

We got there around 6:30pm on a Saturday night and was told we had to wait 25 minutes to be seated. Not sure why people are complaining about waiting. They let us sit and order drinks during the wait. Pro tip: while you wait, strike up a conversation with your date instead of complaining. The food was a bit spicy which we like and the portions were very large.

The car wash is good however these guys have to be the slowest I have ever experienced. Seriously takes them over an hour each time. They sold me on the monthly plan but if they can't get more help then it's not worth it.

This place is so good. Very unique twist on ice cream. I would go here everyday if I lived closer. Macaroons are so good and the toasted marshmallow on top will make you whip and nay-nay like nobody's watching.
