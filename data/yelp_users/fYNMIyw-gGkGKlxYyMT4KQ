First off, I'm giving the Palladium 2-stars because I can't give a Zero and their management isn't actually all that bad.   That being said, there is a lot about this complex that would make me not recommend it.   First, the other residents. You may as well be living in an adult dorm room. You will live amongst some of the rudest and most inconsiderate 20-somethings you've had the pleasure of meeting. I'm convinced we lived underneath Clydesdale horses. From about 6am to 11pm we heard loud stomps constantly. You'll also hear your neighbors as they walk through the halls yelling which causes echoing. Also, every Saturday in the community pool is day club party day which means if you like staying in on Saturday afternoons, you'll be treated to thumping bass throughout the complex.   The parking garage is a whole other disaster in itself. It was not designed for two way traffic and even if it was, the morons that live here don't stay in their own lanes. I'm shocked there isn't daily accidents here. And then, you also have to hope nobody parks in your "reserved" spot because the guest parking is limited to about 15 spots.    All in all, it's a physically nice complex with decent management. However, the awful residents and the nightmare inducing garage are enough to move elsewhere for less money and more space.   However, if you love partying and paying out the ass to live close to the parties, this place is perfect for you.

I have only been to The Chuck Box once before this, and that was just around my first month of living in Tempe. That was almost 5 years ago and I certainly forgot how good this place was!  I can't recall what I ordered here the first time I came but this time I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with Swiss cheese and some fries. With a medium drink added to that I was just a few cents north of $9. Not a bad deal when you get the satisfaction of seeing the actual ground beef patty being grilled in front of you. Everything was delicious again!!   In a world that seems to be into the shi shi burger bars like Delux and Zinburger, it's great to still have an old fashioned burger joint like this around.  Oh yeah, don't forget to bring cash or you'll pay $2.75 getting cash out of their ATM. Just FYI.

I've become quite the fan of Phoenix's love of independent little ice cream shops. I love supporting any local eatery, not to mention when that eatery specializes in ice cream. Having primarily gone to Upward Project's Churn for most of my ice cream cravings, I was apprehensive to try something new.   Melt is definitely worth it if you are looking for some new ice cream. They have your standard flavors like butter pecan and mint chip. But they also will throw in some far out flavors like honey lavender or my favorite, peach melba.  If you love ice cream as much as I do, check this place out. It's in the lovely arts district of Phoenix near other downtown staples like The Lost Leaf and JoBot Coffee. So grab some ice cream, a beer and wash it down with some coffee...or some other order.
