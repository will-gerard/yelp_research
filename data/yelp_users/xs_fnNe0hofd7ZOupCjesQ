Okay...I have been going here for a while and I love the place and the food!  I am surprise it hasn't had as many reviews as it should.  The truth is I come back to support local businesses in my neighborhood...I would come here anyday than go to a Fast Food burger joint..  The trailor that the restaurant is in is the cutest thing you will ever see...straight out of a 50's picture!  Its small but fitting...  The food is very fresh..I love their cheeseburgers and hotdogs..I sometimes even get some of their mango salsa/chutney on the side..they get it from this lady that homemakes it.. Not the cleanliness place but I guess thats what makes it tastes so great!!:)  Its the extra grease...I know that just sounds horrible, but true!  Anyways, support locals and their businesses...go go go!!!

Let me tell ya...I have been going to this area of the valley over the past 5 years hundreds of times, and everytime I do, for some reason I don't have the time to stop in...or when I do, it looks like they are closed.  But I finally made it in this past week and boy am I glad I did!!!  I am really picky when it comes to asian food, some might even call me a food snob:)  I have tried so many different kinds and different restaurants that there is a lot  to compare to. This Japanese restaurant is by far one of my very favorites... Just looking at the little stand alone building this restaurant sits in reminds you of little tokyo in downtown LA.  Walking in you realize IT IS very authentic.  Its owned by a older japanese couple that do all the cooking and servicing themselves!  Its soooo cute!! Looking at the menu, its no none sense.  It is simple and to the point.  There are some items that are catered to the american crowd but the execution on the dishes I ordered is strictly Japanese. Miso Soup was piping hot- love it! The Japanese curry with chicken katsu was probably the best I have tasted here in AZ. I also had the Cold Somen noodles and perfection it was.  The  tsuyu, dipping sauce was flavorful..umami style! This is homestyle japanse cooking at its best!  I will make time for this place everytime I am in the area from now on....I can not believe I almost missed out on this place:)

This is my first review on Yelp so here you go...  I love Yasu!!  This is by far the best sushi and authentic japanese restaurant in Phoenix.  I have been there numerous times and it never disappoints.    You have to try their Sumibiyaki which are items cooked over Japanese charcoal, last time I was there I had the beef tongue..sounds weird but its so good  Nigiri/sashimi are a must.  They always have the best selection and daily special, most important...its always fresh...this is definately important!!  The sweet shrimp is my personal favorite and anything else you order, you will find the fish is sliced with great execution.    Request fresh chopped wasabi, you will never eat sushi with out it again!    Love this place!!

This place was a mess!  I went here for lunch under a reccomendation from a friend...he was not a friend:)  Walking into the restaurant, the atmosphere was very cafeteria like with the white walls and bright lights, I was not feeling it. I did like the fact that this restaurant was owned by Japanese not Korean, this is rare to find in Phoenix:) I remained optimistic, until I looked at the menu.  They had soooo much going on, it was hard to narrow down what there specialty was.  I good restaurant should always have a specialy. After about 15 min of looking at their menu, and the lunch special menu, and the sushi menu, and the special lunch menu board...I ordered... Uni-  Not fresh Sashimi assorted- Not fresh, cut is very thick Tempura- Not crispy, soggy Cold Somen noodles- bad texture, over cooked Miso soup- Made from powder, not paste Sushi Rice-  Not bad  Overall, this place is a no go....why oh why are good sushi/japanese restaurants so limited in Phoenix?!?

This is a great lunch place in downtown phoenix....and I am happy to say I am now a fan!  It took a while but they have it right now....from when it first open to now, its a total 360! The menu is updated, and the food is delicious. Everything on the menu is flavorful and I can not complain....oh and I love the plantains and their carrot-coconut juice!!

I have been wanting to try this place for a while and I finally made it there last weekend... Food was great!!  I had the Duck Confit with sweet dates and waffles...Let me tell ya, I have had many Duck Confit and duck in general, but I gotta say...this was one of my top 3 I have tried NOT just in Phoenix..NOT just in the States...in the world, and I HAVE been to France:) The other dish I tried was the Skate. This is a had dish to manage but the exec chef executed perfectly... The service was a bit slow...It took 45 min for my starter to arrive Advice:  Go after 7pm..they get an early dinner rush due to their Biltmore location.

Besides the little street taco cart that is parked in a lot on 28th st and Mcdowell that I go to for my carne asada tacos...this comes in 2nd place:)  I am really picky about carne asada...many places make them either too dry or not flavorful enough...well not my little street taco cart,,,,and not my America's Taco shop!!! I order two things here..Tacos and Quesadilla.... I normally do not eat quesadilla, but here its something else... Cheese, moist and perfectly seasoned asada, with grilled sauteed onions all between a light crisp homemade tortilla?!?  What else can be better??  Well, maybe there are other things:)  But for this moment, during my 15 sec of fame...I mean review....Lets amuse ourselves:)  Go...you will not be disappointed

This place is heaven!! Been here a few times and now time for a review...  Coming from Southern Cali and often visiting NoCal...tapas, asian tapas is a dime a dozen.  However, in SoCal you see mostly Japanese restaurants who offer this type of experience.  Here in Phoenix, this is the ONLY asian tapas restaurant, I love it!  First off, this is byfar the most urban mod restaurant I have been to in downtown phoenix.  It reminds me of downtown LA meets San Fran:) Its like home!  The vibe here is great, welcoming and friendly, from the owners to the chefs to the servers...  Now the drinks... Again, the only restaurant the I know of in Phoenix serving this amount of Sake.  They have over 80...80!  Not only that they have my favorite...Shochu, including infused Shochu!!  And, Martinis...saketinis...blah blah blah...ok calm down now...bottom line, awesome selection.  Did I just say Awesome? Yeah, I did:) I had the lychee/ginger infused Shochu and their Wasabi Saketini...I wanted to try something different and it turned out better than expected.  It had sake, shochu, wasabi, ginger and gingerale in it...what a combo, I even licked the wasabi drizzle that was in the martini glass!!  For the Food.... Yum..Yum..Yummy..Yum....Variety is the best word to represent this menu...Everything on the menu is unique and you do not see it often at any other restaurant...Is there a recurring theme here?  Yes, this place is original.  Back to the food, some of the things I have tried:(scale of 1-5)  1.  Ginger Duck Salad  4 2.  Red Curry Tofu  5 3.  Spicy Wontons  3.5 4.  Miso with Clams  4.5 5. Wasabi Soy Ck  4 6.  Special:  Mackarel Sashimi (they flame fire the skin!!) 5+ 7.  Dessert:  Goat cheese and cream cheese filled wonton crisp with peach sauce 5+  I can not wait to go back and try more of the food, especially the specials! I highly recommend this place, up there with Yasu Sushi, as far as quality of food goes.  Sens does edge out due to the ambience, dj, and drinks menu...

I can not believe it took me this long to write an update on this place!    Love, love , love...are the words to describe my feelings for you (Sens:)   I was there friday night and the place was packed...in  good way.  Lots of people gazing during our food grazing! The food did not disappoint.  They changed up their menu since the last time I was there and I have to say, the whole experience was even better than the first. I had the edamame with truffle butter, Pad Thai (Sens way) Noodles with crispy tofu, Kurobuta pork sausage with papaya slaw, White ginger fish, and for dessert, sweet wontons with a peach cream sauce. Oh so good!  What was slightly better than the food?!? Their sake list..amazing.   Over 100 different kinds...I was in heaven...I had the Kissui Chrysenthenum Mist Genshu.  It was a great balance of flavor, slightly sweet, med dry.  Perfect accompliment to the food.  I will be back, this time I won't wait too long;)

Been to this place a couple times and I can not really complain about it...good ambience, service, and food. However, this is the kind of place you go to before you go to bed because that is how you are going to feel after dinner here!!  Its comfort food, which is aways good.  Some stand outs are the cheese plate and of course the chicken and waffles. Some of the other dishes I have tried tend to be on the salty side and a little unbalance, flavor profile wise. Its not great food, but good....so why the 4 stars.  If you the guts to open a restaurant in a residential neighborhood, especially in that neighborhood and able to turn a residential house into architector's dream and serving decent food..you deserve 4 stars in my book:)

Overhyped!!  Yeah,  the Chef and manager are from Scottsdale...so what? Yeah,  the pasta are all homemade....so what?  If it ain't good...it just ain't good... even if you used fresh hard to find ingredients, if the execution is not there..the dish is...so what?  Harsh I know, but my one pet peeve is when non-locals come to Downtown claiming to make a change in Downtown..and this is what we get?!?  After talking to the head chef (it was a sat night  and there was 1 table at 9pm)  I find his claims in changing the downtown late dining scene to be obsurd..hello have you heard of Carly's, Fate, Sens....  Anyways, about the food....  I ordered the gnocchi with sausage...it was ok , I have had better....the only thing is..I could not find any sausage!  The portions were a bit small for the price.  The pork shoulder was the other item I ordered that night...it was tender but too salty!  Not my thing...  I ordered coffee which they said they could make, only to come back to me and say that they do not have any coffee cups!  what? :)  My friend and I shared those two items, with 1 drink and tip, it came out to $40 bucks...kinda high when you consider the portions and quality..I dont mind paying that kind of price if the food was good....IF it was good.....

Not a bad place... Its fast, convenient, and the food is not too shabby..  They have a daily selection of entrees you can choose from that are premade in pots.  You choose these items from a computer!  And you pay at the computer!  Very High tech...  I had the butter ck which was surprisingly edible and tasty!  The Naan was made on the spot with dough that they roll out and bake in their special oven:)  Nice I also tried the Mango Lassi which was good, but I did not like the spice they sprinkle on top..  For the setup, location, price and food...I will be back!

It hurts me to say this, fue to the fact that I love local businesses in my hood and I fully support them, but here is another restaurant that I wish would have been better...  Good news...More restaurants opening in Downtown, more options especially late night options...  Bad news...More restaurants opening in Downtown wanting to make a quick buck but does not deliver on food and quality...  I came here with a couple of friends really excited to try the only sushi restaurant in DT open for dinner.  There has been some good review on the place and I wanted to give it a chance...I should have gone north to Hana or Yasu! Walking in, I noticed the decor was another warehouse looking restaurant trying to be modern...only thing is , its not.  From the neon lights under bar to the wood paneling to the tin like tables, chairs, and barstools...its been done 30 times over.  I wish it had more character, a little bit more distinctive.  We are in the art district.  I don't want to walk in a restaurant that looks similar to ones that are already open in the same area?  Okay enough with that, the artist in me is rambling again..sorry..back to the "food" review.  Food:  The menu to me was a little confusing.  For being a Sushi joint, it had so many other things also, mostly stirfry items.  I decided to stick to what I came here to try, sushi.  I ordered squid salad to start.  I should not have ordered that to start.  The salad was so salty and it was drowning in dressing...bad start...I then ordered some sashimi including saba, sweet shrimp, and of course my favorite toro.  I was a little disappointed that they did not have uni..how can you not have uni!  Saba...not bad... Sweet Shrimp....foul tasting Toro.....couldn't even bite through it A good sushi joint has to have fresh fish...good sushi needs to be executed by a sushi chef with good knife skills...simple as that.. When your fish is not that fresh and your sushi chef fish slicing techniques are not there, you have a losing combo.  My friend out of frustration had the head chef make us something...He brought out the geisha roll. Spicy tuna is not my thing but out of courtesy, we did ask him to pick, I tried it..it was ok, again I am not too keen on chopped up tuna, which in this case tasted like it was food processed.  A little too mushy..  Drinks: Beers: Been done.  Infused vodkas: Been done Cocktails: Been done.  Good Points:  Nice staff, cool Teapots, and clean restrooms  All in all, I guess I was hoping for a sushi joint that was more innovative and creative with equally good skills to execute.  Maybe I am too harsh.  Or maybe I am just saying it how it is...As I left the joint, I felt like I have been to a sushi restaurant like that so many times before...  Hopefully they will succeed with less critical customers unlike myself..best of luck!!

Okay, I have not given any place a one star review in a while, and looking at some of this restaurant's "friend"ly reviews... I am one of the only few that has given this place a one star.  Why?? Overall feeling.  A big part of liking or loving a restaurant not just about the food or service.  Its the atmosphere and how it makes you feel.  Here....it seems out of place.   This restaurant is pushing a concept and atmosphere onto downtown phoenix that seems to fit better in Scottsdale.  Here in downtown, we are a bit more down to earth, we like to feel welcomed and comfortable when coming to a restaurant...we don't want to sit upright and nibble on a $5 Chicken wing!  And yes it is is Wing....singular! With that out of the way...lets move on  Service:  Not ban but not good.  The servers were not helping in describing the dishes.  Especially for a asian fusion restaurant, this is a must Ambience:  The patio looked great...the decor was kinda weird...I did not get the music nor the art that was displayed.  It did not fit the concept. Drinks:  I didn't even order...not interesting  Food:  I had the Duck Confit  which I have to say one of the worst I have had.  It was so oily and flavorless. Spring Roll- how can anyone over soak rice paper?? It was so soggy, I took one bite and that was it Lop Xeong Crepe- Again another soggy item....urggh Tonkotsu Ramen- This was not done correctly...the broth is too rich...not in a good way Dessert-Blueberry Mochi with Lychee sorbet-  Now this was great!!  The textures and sweetness, good balance  All in all, I was really disappointed with this restaurant.  I wish the chef/owner would have stuck to something more similar to his other successful concepts which are more in line with his skills...Asian fusion I don't think is his niche...there are many asian fusion restaurants that have better execution... The Mission is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix...that should have been a model when opening a new restaurant...that is what downtown phoenix needs.

Ok...I waited a while to write a review about this place because I wanted to at least get two visits under my belt before I make any praises or judgements....and the verdict is...da da the da da..well you already know what it is!  Since this is the only restaurant specializing in hot pot here in Phoenix/Chandler, maybe all of Arizona, there really is no other place I can compare it to.  So I gotta compare it to the hot pot/shabu shabu restaurants I have visited in L.A, San Gabriel, etc. Compared to the other places I have been, this place tops the list!  The soup broths that they offer are very unique to different asian regions.  I had the Ying Yang which is half non spicy traditional chinese herbal broth and half traditional Taiwanese Ma La Spicy herbal broth.  Sometimes these other place would make the Ma La broth not edible because there is too much of the numbing spice, but here they make it just right.  They also did not skimp on the herbs used in the broth...very flavorful.  THey also offer all their broths vegetarian.  The second time I was there I tried the spicy Lemongras veggie style and is was also very good. So, Tien got the broth down, but what about their menu items?  Three words...Fresh and Top Quality. All the veggies and mushrooms I ordered were very fresh.  This is important because with Hot pot/Shabu Shabu there is no hiding bad or poor quality items.  THe meat selection was also cut perfectly and of top quality...comparable to the top Shabu restaurants I have been to in Cali. I ordered the Shabu beef, lamb, and beef tongue.  the shabu was so tender, it basically melted in my mouth! In addition, the udon I had was also very good and so was everything else I had the two time I was there. Everything here is a la carte, so you can always get something different with each visit. All in all, I will be back again, and again, and again...keep up the quality and the service and I am sure this place will gain the popularity it deserves!!

Wow.. Ramen and boba teas with the hot pot! I am in heaven! New name btw, T.Spot. Came here to try the newly expanded menu  and I have to say..it is the best ramen I have had in AZ! The broth is simmered with pork bone and you can really tell the difference.. Noodles are cooked perfect and I love the pickled ginger that comes with. Tried the honey green tea with sea salt cream... And loved it.. It's sweet and creamy.. Still craving it! Will be back for my usual Shabu hot pot fix.. Looks like the quality of this place is still the best:)

So T.Spot is formally Tien Wong hot pot. I guess they changed it with the new additions to the menu.. Here you can find ramen, Shabu hot pot, and boba teas.. Even honey toast!  Came in and had the Tonkotsu Ramen.. Delish! The best Ramen I have had in AZ.. The pork bone soup is evident.  A lot of other places that I have tried do not put in the effort to use simmered pork soup for the ramen.  Shabu hotpot looks good like always.. Will come back soon for that! Love!
