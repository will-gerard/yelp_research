HORRIBLE experience. Got a couple of the Groupons thinking it was a good deal and bc my dad grew up in Phoenix and we used to come here a while ago for their formerly good food and service. However, we will never be back again and opted not to even use our balance because of how poorly we were treated. The Groupon actually expired yesterday and I was really tired but was going to make the 40 minute drive anyways but I thought I'd call and just check to see if they would extend the offer til today as some company's are courteous in that way. I spoke to a gentleman on the phone and explained that I knew my Groupon was expiring that night but would they let me come today for the deal and he said yes that would be fine. So today I make the drive and was told "no" by the girl behind the counter. I explain the whole situation about calling last night and that I spoke to a guy and she just said "I know who you spoke to but that's not our policy so you can't get the deal."  No apology or attempt to rectify the situation.  I should probably add that there was NO ONE there and she could have easily extended our offer and established return customers but she had no custom service skills. When I asked her name she said it is Courtney but it looks like she has replied to reviews on here as "Anna S." so who knows. And after reading more reviews about ppl who have gotten food poisoning after eating here recently maybe it's for the better!

Just ate at Aunt Chilada's and it was very tasty. Some people commented that they didn't like the noodles (fideo) with the beans but that was my favorite part! I didn't really care for them alone, but mixed in with the beans it was delicious!   I ordered number 7 (cheese enchilada + green corn tamale) which was good, albeit pretty standard and my mom got the chicken tortilla soup which she said she would definitely get again. And I'd have to agree with the other yelpers- the chips and salsa are FANTASTIC!

If you watch the news at all I'm sure you've already seen Dr. Van Dyke, she is the go-to expert when it comes to skin in the Phoenix area and nationally as well. I would not trust my skin to anyone else.    As I near my 30s I've been more into skin care and what I could do to treat some minor sun damage from this lovely Arizona weather and Dr. Van Dyke suggested and IPL w/ PDT.  My mom got a more intense laser the same week as I did and we could not be more thrilled with the results.  Dr. Van Dyke suggested the perfect individualized treatments for each of our skin types.  Since it was my first laser treatment I wasn't sure what to expect and was a little bit nervous but I was so at ease once I got there.  From the moment you walk in you are welcomed by the friendly staff and inviting waiting room with plush couches, tv, coffee, and other drinks.  Check in was smooth everyone I interacted with was so sweet and comforting.  Kelly helped out a lot and is so sweet, she's remembered me by name since my treatment which is always so nice and she exemplifies the little something extra Van Dyke Laser and Skin has over everyone else.  The RN, Heather, that did my treatment is not there anymore because she is now a Nurse Practitioner but I she was a delight to talk to, especially since I am a new nursing student. I can't wait to go back for another treatment and have full trust in her replacement, because I know doc only hires the best.    If you get the chance, attend one of her open house's and bring a friend!  They are super fun and you get a 20% discount which helps a student like me.  There is always great food and drinks and you can learn so much.  As soon as I hear of one I plan my schedule around it, they're that great!

After shopping at "Sissy's" as I like to call it, it's really hard to pay full price for anything!  I love that I can get my TB Reva's for under $100 and score on vintage bags for a steal!  It's also nice to be able to buy something "for free" with my credit from consigning items but I sometimes feel like I'm not getting enough for my things.  I also tend to get quite upset when my once treasured items get rejected but I find some truly heinous items on the racks.  Oh well, I still love it and go at least once a week!

You really can't go wrong with Trader Joe's.  The staff is always there to help and go the extra mile which makes it a pleasure to shop here... which I do... often.  I happen to have a little addiction to their seaweed snacks (yes its weird, but I love them), and one time I opened them up and there was nothing in the package.  I happened to find it more funny than irritating and mentioned it to them the next time I was in and they just told me to go pick out another package and that was that!   If you're ever looking for new, easy recipe ideas the little sample kitchen is a great place to check out.  They are always cooking up something creative and delicious!

Three words: "GET HERE EARLY!!!" I can only tolerate Last Chance once in a while, when I "have the feeling."  The store and crowds totally drive me nuts with all the disorganization and pushyness of other patrons but you can get some really good deals- as long as the stuff isn't damaged, which a lot of the merchandise is.  So if you're a bargain shopper that's down with being overwhelmed and have a lot of patience, this may be a good find for you.  Call me an anxious snob but Last Chance is just a little too much for me!

Mmmm gelato.   I have mixed feelings about this place- the gelato is good, but not amazing, the prices are pretty steep for what you get, and when I was here recently the girl behind the counter was giving everyone the stink-eye.  Maybe she was just having a bad day, which happens to the best of us, but it was slightly uncomfortable and I was a almost scared to ask for a second sample.  I'll probably still come here after I go to the movies or eat at Pita Jungle next door, but its not something I would go out of my way for.

LOVE Bliss- from the products to the treatments, I love it all!!  The fabulous facial with the microderm add-on is my favorite but everything is pretty amazing to be honest.  The Triple Oxygen + C mask is a great thing to have at home for treating your skin when you can't get in for the real thing.  Also, who could not love throwing brownies back while you wait? :) YUM!

If today was my first time at True Food Kitchen, I would probably give it one or two stars only, but because I've been there a few times, I have to give it more.    I went for breakfast today and the service was just terrible.  We ordered coffee to drink, and the cups sat empty for almost the entire meal until we were able to flag down another waitress.  Same case for the syrup for our pancakes, and we were one of four tables there... that's just not acceptable.    But the shining star is the food- I just LOVE the food here.  I've been for every meal and there is always something I love.  The quinoa blueberry johnny cakes are wonderful for breakfast and the salmon is great for dinner.  I also love their elixir's- the green arnie and cucumber refresher are my faves- super refreshing!!   If you're going to try True Food, and I definitely think you should, I suggest going for dinner when the service is so much better!

So I had a first date and needed to pick a spot to go.  He was naming the places and I was yaying or naying them.  He said there's a place where you can sit outside and there's a fire pit and I was sold.  I got there first and got us a table outside and under a heat lamp and the wait staff was really nice while I waited, making sure I had everything I wanted.  He got there and we both ordered a beer, and he got the hula burger and I had the coconut shrimp roles with a side of plantains.  The shrimp rolls were good, not amazing but I would get them again and he said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had.  I stole a few fries and they were awesome.  I wasn't that impressed with the plantains- I'm used to a different preparation but they were okay.  I would definitely go back for the great atmosphere and to try out some of their specialty drinks.

I could have sworn that I already reviewed Totties before but maybe not.   I've been there 3 times and the food is consistently delicious.  The restaurant itself if pretty small but I love the decor, it feels very homey, and they have a cute patio for warmer times of the year.    First let me rave about our waitress.  We sat in Lottie's (no that's not a typo) section and she was so amazing.  She has the most warm and friendly personality, was really helpful with suggestions, didn't wince one bit for special requests, and made the whole dining experience that much more enjoyable.  Ask for her when you go there!!   Okay, on with the food!  I went with my parents and we had the Calamari, Edamame, Pho Tai, Salmon Satay, Veggie Fried Rice, Pad Thai, and coconut ice cream.    1. Calamari- $5 on the happy hour menu, whoop whoop! The calamari comes with a panang (I think... its like a coconut curry) sauce and the breading is extra crunchy, not oily like some fried calamari can be so that was quite delectable!  2. The Pho Tai-  my favorite. It comes with a delicious broth, noodles, and beef (I'm not really a beef person so I just ate around it).  The soup also comes with  basil, cilantro, plum sauce, siracha, and bean sprouts on the side for you to customize it which I think is very cool.  My dad and I shared a soup and asked Lottie if they could split it in two bowls and the portions were still huge.  The broth was so delicious that I just added the bean sprouts, basil, and cilantro and no sauces.  My dad added the sauces and omitted some of the other items and it was like we had two totally different soups!   3. Salmon Satay- I was way too into my soup to care about the salmon satay (my mom ordered it).  I tried a bite just so i could yelp about it (loser, much?) but I was on food overload and so I failed on that.  Sorry! My mom wouldn't stop talking about how good it was though and it was on the HH menu for just $5.   4. Edamame- You know what edamame tastes like.  5. Veggie fried rice- I only had like 2 bites because I was so full from the calamari and shrimp so I'll have to update this after I have it tomorrow for lunch!  6. Pad Thai- This was my first time trying Pad Thai and I really liked it!  Again, I could only fit like 2 bites in but it was tangy, sweet, and very fresh tasting.    7. Coconut ice cream- Gahhhhhh this stuff is amazing!! Tottie herself makes it almost every day and it is sooooo good.  She uses coconut milk instead of dairy and there are little pieces of coconut in it and it is like a tropical heaven in your mouth.  Sadly, I could only have like 3 bites of this due to my prior gluttony.   ...Okay, I'll update late! But in the mean time, get your tushes to Totties! :)

My favorite yogurt place in the valley- and trust me, I've tried just about all of them.  I don't know why, but Yogurtology always tastes the freshest and least aftificial to me.  I love that they have so many delicious flavors and toppings as well- and never scoff at you when you want to try every flavor! ;)

Had an awful experience with Jimmy Woos.  I wish I would have written this review a few weeks ago when it happened but it slipped my mind until just now.  I group of us from work got take out from here and while I know take out leaves more room for error, this was incredible.  I got a kids meal because I wanted a little bit of everything and the dessert included.  I got the shrimp lo mein that came with beef instead of shrimp, they charged me for the fried rice which was supposed to be included, and they didn't even give me my dessert which I was so excited about.  Luckily I work with nice people so one of them went back to the restaurant for me to tell them how they completely messed up my order and they took off the fried rice charge and gave us a free dessert but just too much had gone wrong to recover me so I probably won't be back.  Sorry Jimmy Woos.. I really did want to like you!

Even though I've only rated this place with 2 stars, I still come here pretty frequently b/c its the only bagel place convenient to me.  I've never really had a stellar experience here but I keep hoping for one!  I do really like the bagels but they always seem to skimp on the cream cheese.  I used to love Einsteins because they would liberally cover the bagel but now its so thin I can see the bagel underneath or a quarter of it has no cream cheese at all.  I'm from NY- I need lots of cream cheese! The service is always friendly, but usually very slow.  So lack of cream cheese + slow service = 2 stars.  Hopefully it's just because they're still relatively new and will step up their game in the months to come :)

I discovered Deneke Hair Salon from a Groupon deal last year and have been going here ever since.  I see Debbie and she does such an amazing job with my fine, frail hair.  The enzyme developer she uses helps my hair not break since I highlight it so much and seeing her makes my day (and hair) so much brighter!  Her and Bobby are such good, genuine people and I feel so lucky that I found them.  After seeing my hair one day after I got it done, two of my classmates wanted the number and now see Debbie as well :) That's how you know you have a good hair person!

Amazing food and juices but super sloooow service- especially in the morning.  Almost had to leave my juice there because I brought my dog and she couldn't stay outside in the heat for so long. It'd be great if they had just one or two more people working instead of one girl trying to handle the Sunday morning brunchers. The liver and kale cleanses are my favorite juices!
