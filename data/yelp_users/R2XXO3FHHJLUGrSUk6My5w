First of all I never thought I would be writing a review for a funeral home however I lost my sister very sudden. Julia handled everything for me and my family.  She and the staff are the reason why they are named best funeral home.  They blended in with our guest and you could tell they genuinely care and want to help make everything seamless. Julia went as far as giving me her personal cell number and advised me to call anytime. Its rare when I get amazing customer service.  Thank you so much. I cant even thank you enough. If your wanting care and that white glove service then choose this funeral home because they will go that extra mile.

"Do not do business with them unless you like to be harassed by unwanted phone calls!  I've never written this story because I am one of those, oh it's a dealership, they're all crooks. But I've decided to finally write about my experience now since they won't leave me alone. When I even owned my 2009 lancer, I took it in due to the battery corrosion. This was early 2014. They exaggerated. Told me that the corrosion went far into the cabling and that some parts were on back order from Japan and would takes over 6 weeks to get. Costs were in the thousands. I had a friend who worked on cars take a look, he order the special battery fuse replacement from a Texas dealership for about $40 and fix it as soon as it arrived in about 3-5 days.  Now, I haven't even owned the lancer for about 9 months and they will not leave me alone. I've had them on my blocked list with my phone company and now I have their phone calls forwarding to a voice mail without even getting through to me since re-blocking them is annoying and I forget to keep up to date. I have spoken to one rep who advised they'd removed me from the list. A second time, I called back annoyed requesting to be removed which they kindly said they'd do. Another time, I just had it, called them back, advised that I'd already called and said I don't have the car and that I'd been told I've been removed from the call list. I told him that I'm going to report them. The guy sighed as if HE was annoyed, claimed to be a manager, and claimed to have taken care of it.  Can anyone guess what happened next? I received another phone call from them so I followed through and wrote this up. I'll be posting this on BBB, Yelp, and Facebook and any other social media I can due to the company's inability to do as the customer requested. Especially when I don't even have the vehicle anymore."

This restaurants customer service was really nice! I tried the Baked Potato Soup and it was so amazing and very light tasting and not heavy on the stomach. I also had the Chicken Cesar Wrap. I really like the scene and the food. I had an over all great experience and would go again!

First of all me and my friends all met up for 3 couples date. The host greeted us and sat us promptly. We got waters and our drinks. Very quick service. We ordered our food and took about 10 minutes or so to receive it. I ordered a chicken fried rice with curry. I did not taste the curry so I am giving it 4 stars because I think they forgot to add it into my rice.  I did order food to go. I order the yellow curry with rice to go. I could taste the coconut milk with the curry and was not a big fan of the milky taste. I would go again because of the service and prices and happy hour is a plus!

This has the be the BEST dentist office I have been to. They treat you with the utmost respect and are patient. I have had my wisdom teeth pulled and many other things completed and have never had an issue. They are very up to date with technology which is a plus for someone like me. They send you text reminders of appointments so you don't have to answer a call on your busy work day. Thank you Dental Depot for all you do!

I have been going to the other location on Indian School for years as my sister used to work there. I was driving home one day from the Arrowhead Mall and noticed the same name and got super excited. I took my fiancee and two kids here and they loved it as much as I did and the food taste the same as the other location and the restaurant is so beautiful. My favorite part was when your waiting they have a fire going outside to keep you warm in the cold months! The staff is super awesome and very friendly.

My experience with Airpark Collision Center was excellent. Immediately after receiving my estimate from the insurance company, I decided to drive right up to this place (close to my work) to get some help! I said a couple sentences and Jeff had the confidence to make it sound so easy. He ordered the parts I needed and received them within a few days. I was able to drop my Jeep off the very next morning after he received the parts. They took care of everything. By the end of the day, I was able to drive away, super happy. The team even had the Jeep washed and vacuumed. Although, I hope to not end up in another fender bender, if I ever do get in another accident, I'm going back to Airpark Collision Center. The experience was stress-free, and when your vehicle is damaged, that's all you can ask for. I can't thank this team enough for making it so easy! (I don't use Yelp, but I made my partner post it because I was so pleased with them!)

I have never been to a Sushi restaurant before so for my first experience it went really well. Everyone there was very friendly and nice. Yong was our server and she made me feel comfortable and explained how everything goes and what's what. I do not like Sushi but my fiancee loves it. She enjoyed the Sushi and I enjoyed a chicken lo mien dish. We both had a blast and enjoyed the music and low lighting. It's a perfect place for date night or a girls night out!

We decided to take my son who turned 11 here because he wanted to play Laser Tag. We did a Labor Day Weekend deal where you pay 15.95 for unlimited laser tag, bowling, and gravity rope. Mind you on top of the fee for the pass you have to pay about 3.00 to rent shoes for bowling, they do provide complimentary socks if you forgot to bring a pair.   Laser Tag- It was two stories and pretty decent to play for 15 minutes. The kids seemed to enjoy it and the adults.  Bowling- This had to been my most favorite experience. They have a electronic guards that come up for whichever player you select it for. So for the kids we had them put up and for the adults we did not. This made it convenient for us all to bowl how we liked.  Another cool concept was you take three photos and it will appear on the point screen and do little cool animations of your face doing something fun.  Gravity Rope- Very similar to whats at Castle and Coaster if you have been there.   Now for the most terrible part of our trip and reason for the low score.   The food was really good once we got our food and order correct. Granted we did have a large party but I never been to a restaurant and been served so poorly even with a large group. We ordered The Works and they continued to mess our order up. Once they got the toppings correct they still had the size wrong but after waiting over an hour to get my food I did not care I was so hungry. Once the waitress brought the correct pizza she said with a sassy attitude, "Heres The Works with NO MEATBALLS AND NO OLIVES." Then goes to slam down our pizza like we were the worst customers. My fiancee asked for the manager twice and at the end when we were leaving he offered us play cards but we were leaving why would we want to stay after all we went through. They also charge you up front for the food before getting it. I think they do that so once you pay they can treat you like dirt. I never been treated so poorly at an establishment before.
