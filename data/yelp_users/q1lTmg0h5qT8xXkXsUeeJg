Eat here at your own risk. I have eaten here two or three times never had anything great happen but never anything terrible. Food was okay, service terrible but they had good specials. I made the mistake of ordering oysters tonight they took twenty minutes to come out. The lady saw me confused as to why I was waiting so long and told me they had just been taken out of the freezer and needed to defrost. At this point I told her if they are not ready I don't want them ( who wants oysters that are defrosted then topped with some chopped onions and some slimy gross tasting yellow muck). She says they are coming right out. They were by far the worst oysters I have ever had. Thinking the taste was from the horrible preparation, disappointed, and disgusted I ate them anyway out of pure starvation. The lady never checked on me to see how it was left my water empty for most the meal and then asked if we wanted anything else. All I wanted was to get out of there I payed the 16.40 and left. I felt sick on the way home and when I got home immediately threw up everything I ate. I called back to complain and let them know the seafood they were serving is not safe. The manager did not care at all about the fact the oysters were sick and only after more complaining offered me a ten dollar credit. Are you f****ing kidding me so I just payed 6 dollars at your restaurant to puke and now I have to come back for the shit food and service another day. Ya right this place is disgusting! I will never eat there again and neither should you lol

Would give this place 0 stars if I could. The food is terrible and their manager is even worse. Absolute  joke doesn't know customer service and has a nasty attitude. We went in,I had a plate of appetizers it was terrible. I being straving and already there went back for a plate of salad and some chicken fried rice. It was also terrible figuring that nobody can mess up chicken fried rice it was my last ditch effort. It tasted like dog food. I told the girl I was going to leave and she got the manager who told me it would be 6.99 for a lb of food. We ate in total a few crab puffs, at this point  I was frustrated I told her charge me whatever I just wanted to get out of this terrible experience. She then at the cash register gives me some bs about how we would have known right away if it was bad and know she's charging us for one person 20 dollars. I payed while letting her know she was losing a customer. She didn't care. If you want eat at a restaurant who values you as a guest definitely do not eat here. You shouldn't anyways the food sucks.
