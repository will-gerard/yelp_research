I've been at this location since it was opened and I must say this past weekend, I think I experienced the best service!  The Asian Chicken Salad -awesome!  Two people can eat this salad it's so BIG!  I was there twice this weekend, I also had a chicken sandwich which was great and fullfilling.  The waitress remembered what we drank so that was great.  I was with a large group of people and the staff at Majerle's took care of everyone really well.    The Strawberry Fields Salad looks really good as well, yumm!!!

I go to Blue Fin for lunch with friends almost every other month.  Locally owned and the little Japanese lady (we call her "mama" san) thanking everyone for coming and making sure your cup is full is awesome and one of the main reasons I keep going back for more.  Food is great for Japanese fast food.  I just tried their coconut shrimp and it was awesome!  If you are hungry try the terriyaki chicken , rice and salad combo, yum!!

Close to work yet I think I will keep walking.  I've been there for breakfast and lunch and it's ok.  I tried their spicy peanut slaw, and all you can taste is sriracha and nothing else, bleh!  I couldn't eat it, it was not flavorful just a burning heat. Sandwiches are ok, nothing to really jump and down about.

ABC15 has one of the best staff I've gotten to work with the past few years.  The anchors are always nice and friendly.  I recently volunteered with Irene V. for the Operation Santa.  A lot of effort from ABC15 for putting on such a great holiday event and for four great non profits which help many in the valley.  Smart Shopper is also a great segment to find the best deals in the valley.   I usually have ABC15 on in the morning for the news.  And when I hear the name "Joe" , I always think of "Let Joe Know".

Local and cute setting in central Phoenix.  Love the Hakata soup, basically Ramen noodles, but inexpensive for a bowl of warm yumminess!  It can be pretty loud at times, if full, but that's ok, I've been in much worse.  It's very Japanese with a twist for those who are unfamiliar with Japanese foods, you can always order an Italian dish instead.  Sushi is good, and reasonable in price as well.  The cooks are insight and friendly with those sitting at the bar.  You know it's pretty authentic when you see more Japanese/Asian sitting and eating their bowl of soup, many choices to choose from too!

I like coming into this store.  It's clean and always has great selection and deals.  However, me and a friend of mine went late one night to shop and I ended up finding great deals.  So I spent about $50 that night.  I walked out and my friend asked what did I get.  Well I didn't have everything in the bags so I went back inside to get it from the cashier.  The first cashier or maybe she was a manager saw me and I told her I just walked out and noticed that I was missing items.  She basically accused me of not telling the truth, gave me a dirty look like I was a thief and really didn't want help.  So I made my way back to the cashier who also denied that she had the bag and again accused me of lying since I walked out.  I think they felt I would make a scene which I would've because I was telling the truth and plus they were going to be closing within 15 minutes and there was a line!  THEN giggling the cashier, she pulls the bag from the bottom shelf by her...she totally knew that she had it and she herself was lying. I have a feeling this isn't the first time they've tried this with people. So watch your bags!   And I've worked in retail, really lame employees and actions that night.

Mmmmmm..a Combo please!  Pastrami and Corn beef together at last on a soft onion bun with Swiss cheese (or without)..best thing when you are craving MEAT! Yep, certainly not a diner for vegans.  Miracle Mile has been around forever, and I love to have a great sandwich or entree at this location.  From deli sandwiches to daily specials like meatloaf, roast chicken even cabbage and corn beef, it's a miracle I haven't gain 20 pounds from here! And they have Cream Soda...mmmm.   Side dishes include fries, potato salad, salads, mac n' cheese and potato pancakes.  The portions are huge that you can share or take the left overs home for a midnight meal.

Urban Hair, you walk in and transported from strip mall to retro, pop, funky, hip stylish hair salon in town.  Not too expensive and you don't walk out with  a "cheap" haircut.   The decor is awesome, can't wait for the winter holiday decor!  I see Topaz on Saturdays, and she cuts it how I want it, and it's not costly.  Call Miss K, let her know what your style needs are and she will set you up with a great hair stylist!

LOVE their pastries, all of them, just awesome!  Chocolate Croissants..yum, could eat those every morning!  If you go see a movie, stop by and pick up  a sinful treat and head to your movie..definitely worth the money..more than the popcorn!

After reading Judy F. 's update, I will no longer go to this establishment.  I was a BIG supporter of this cafe when it was at the Esplanade, however reading Judy B. or Frenchie B's comments, private and a review, I will never send anyone there.  And I've sent many, saying the desserts are wonderful.  The desserts may be wonderful, however, that type of attitude is not needed from those who are related to the owners or who are the owners.   Very disappointing.  Desserts are worth more than Mc D's yes however the attitude is not worth my time, therefore, I will have my caramel sundae for a $1or support another local cafe.   All yelpers try to help locals, however, this cafe doesn't seem to care and approach the reviews very defensively.

Location is the ONLY reason I go to this gym and I've been going to this location and others for the past five years.  This past fall, I had gone to the gym after a few months hiatus.  I was on the treadmill for 30 minutes then went back to my locker.  It was broken into.  My purse and phone were taken but not my car keys or Smart Water.  I guess the robber must have seen what I drove (hint: it's probably an inside job )  There were only 2 staff members on site, both young men-no women on staff (hint: hint: it's probably an inside job then) A police officer did come and I reported the robbery which was the 3rd in two weeks!  The next day, I spoke with the manager.  The same speech he's probably have told others, you can tell the bottom line is the only thing he cares about.  I lost everything plus a $100 bill which was my b-day money and I've spent over a few grand for membership.  I did receive a refund for 3 months but still REALLY!  'Well you shouldn't leave stuff in the locker.  These people go to gym to gym.  We have signs that tell you not to leave items in the lockers"...ummm it was locked and I've been going here for over four years and have never had an issue until now. If you are having robberies, you NEED to tell people not just a sign!  Plus one of the staff told me they were having major issues this past fall...umm that's not someone from the outside that's a staff member doing the robberies!  I found out last week there were MORE robberies!  So if you are looking for a gym, move on and go somewhere else.  It's not the cleanest gym but I like the sauna and that's about it! And then I get a call that they found my purse and calendar in a locker.  The manager never followed up with me and when I got my items they were sfuffed in a drawer and the staff member didn't even seem to care.  I think it's time for a new staff and management!

Finally, I had gotten a chance to have dinner here.  The valet parking has always detoured me from going to LGO.  I have the cheese pizza and tried the kale salad.  The cheese pizza had a lot of flavor, there wasn't a ton of sauce but it was really tasty and the crust was crispy.  It took awhile to get our food but the service was good and having good conversation with friends made it worth the wait.    I will have to come back for breakfast.  i do love your muffins!

Breakfast!  Love the fact they are open at the crack of dawn.  The service was ok.  The table was very small with seats that will make you uncomfortable.  I got the  Eggs Benedict with spinach, bacon, tomato and avocado.  The server was nice to have them take off the avocado that I guess looked funny to him however, didn't really appreciate the extra charge of $2.50 for 2 slices of tomatoes.  The plate was cold and the eggs were luke warm.  The spinach was on the bottom of the plate and not layered on the muffin and looked like it was taken out of the frig and plopped onto the plate.  Not cooked at all!  Place was pretty busy throughout the morning, which is great for a small place however, need to step up on the food I think.

My grandfather stayed at this hospital this past fall.  The staff and doctors were so nice and helpful.  He didn't complain about the food, so I guess it was ok.  I did eat in their cafe which is by the main entrance.  Pretty good for hospital food and cheap! His room was huge, very clean and newly remodeled.  Thank you to the doctors and nurses that took care of him!

Wow!  Nice to see a bookstore that's not too over priced!  The staff was friendly.  I found some unique gifts for the holidays which didn't break the bank.  Lots of used books to choose from and new ones too.  The vinyl section was cool too!

Horrible service. I walked in and waited. The restaurant wasn't that busy and I could see there were tables available.  The lady in front of me had 8 in her party, the manager seemed very stressed when she told him the size of her party.  He had told the lady, I don't think I have a place for you because I don't have a full staff.  This was on a Saturday morning and right before the holidays!  He saw me standing and waiting by the door while others were coming in to dine.  He said somewhat rudely "You can sit down and wait.  I'll be right with you"  I never once was  rude to him and I was waiting patiently while he assisted the lady with a party of 8.   I was shocked by his tone and so I walked out. Never eating at that Coco's!  I found a local cafe down the street and so glad I did.

One tortilla with butter will make you love Carolina's! I've been going here since I was 19 and working at America West Arena and it hasn't changed a bit over the years.    Open at 7 a.m., expect a line with hungry guests waiting to order their regular ..green chili burro or try the eggs, machaca and potatoes burro.   Lunch time, Carolina's is a hot spot for downtown workers who are ok about venturing into a central neighborhood, so go early!   The building is old and there's no glitz and glamor to the furniture but when you have really good authentic Mexican food, who needs that!

If your grandparents are in town, then they will probably like Cracker Barrel.  Very bland menu. My waitress was a little odd and really seemed unorganized with her tables.  I ordered the Uncle Herschel's Favorite .Two Eggs with Grits, Sawmill Gravy and Homemade Buttermilk Biscuits along with Real Butter and the best Preserves and Grilled Pork Chop is what's on the menu.  However, the grits were really runny, eggs overcooked, the "grilled" pork chop need salt nor was it grilled and the "best" Preserves, I have no idea what that's supposed to be.  I really don't think Uncle Herschel would like the dish!  My coffee cup was never filled until I was ready to go.  It's cheap but really not what I had expected from Cracker Barrel.

After a long week or after a big working event, I have been going to this location for some pampering.  Love it, and it's reasonable. I usually go all out and get a manicure and a pedicure "with everything" .  A really nice staff.  My nails and toenails always looked good for weeks when I've gone.  I've never really had to wait that long to get a chair and they have stayed open late for walk-ins.

WoW!     So legit, the real Japanese sushi experience is at Hiro.  Without any special motif or hip Scottsdale decor, it's Japanese and sushi at it's BEST!  Chefs..Japanese, who greeted every person that was walking through the door. It's  pretty small place, like ones found in Japan, and has one of the longest sushi bars I've seen in Arizona.   With daily specials written on the wall including conch (From Florida) in miso to spicy scallop rolls that are sweet and spicy.  The seaweed salad is always a great way to being your meal, Hiro's tempura was crispy and light, and the sushi was very fresh.    It is so hard to find a REAL sushi house and this one that I will be going back again and again!  The service was great all in all from beginning to finish.    We walked in not knowing what to expect, the prices seemed reasonable for sushi and we walked out knowing this hidden gem, is the place to be for sushi !    P.S. First Asian restaurant I've seen in Scottsdale, that I've seen alot of Japanese go to, AWESOME cause I know it must be fresh and good! And it was.

Located right across from Symphony Hall, we decided to have a drink before a show.   Networks was not that busy with many watching the games on the flat screens.  We sat there for about 5 minutes, no one came by to greet us or take our orders so we moved to the bar and had a quick drink.  Not my first place for a drink downtown!

Growing up Phoenix, the Biltmore was a special place to visit especially during the holidays.  I used to spend Christmas Eve with my best friends at Houlian's for lunch.  We would go and people/dog watch.. and now you can still people and dog watch but also, maybe see a few sports players hanging out..especially at the Apple store.  Recent years, stores/shops have been going up and closing, however, the Biltmore is definetely less snobbish than Fashion Square, no matter what anyone says.    The parking out in the front really isn't that bad.  For one, if you are going to go to the Biltmore, you will spend some money.  All you have to do is take the little yellow coin that comes out, and when you make a purchase in one of the shops, they will validate it, and you get 2 hours for free..not really that hard people to do.     And the Bilmore is showing films in the courtyard, yoga in the morning, great restraurants and shops....if you don't like animals..dogs, cats, wolfs, ferrets, birds..etc..well, Fashion Square is down the street, lots of plastic, botox, nose in the air, and unfriendly store workers..I will take the animals and being outside strolling in and out of the shops anytime.

It's all about wonderful glasses of wine at Kazimierz and the amazing conversations you can have with the company you bring behind the door which reads Truth is Inside.  One can spend any amount really on a glass of wine or a bottle of wine.  A 1917 bottle, only $10,000, and it must be divine, however, I went with a pinot gris and Tuscany pizza, a really nice pairing.  The decor is pretty nice, over-sized couches, tables in the corners, it's very dark, and yes worth every sip of wine to find this Scottsdale wine bar..and if I had not gone to another restaurant prior to Kazimierz, I would've been drinking more.  I'm definitely going back and have to thank my friend David for telling me about this place! He was so excited about Kazimierz while telling me what he had drank, that I had to find the bar and have at least one glass of wine!  And the truth is there's no other wine bar I would go to in Scottsdale except for what's behind the wooden door. Cheers!

I was expecting so much from Tottie's.  The entire experience was very unwelcoming and just lack authentic flavor in the dish we ordered.  Known as a Asian Fusion, I thought  would be a fusion of flavors, however they have a Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese menu...not really a fusion.    The staff was somewhat obnoxious.  I overheard, one staff member tell our waitress, in a snobby tone, "They just want water" It was hot outside and yeah I would like some water to start off.  I would've gotten a drink but after hearing that, why bother. Staff members were later talking really loud about their lives and stories and was just really put off by it.   The menu was overwhelming.  There were special Tottie's dishes which didn't have a description of it was. I asked about the Dragonfly dish, and what type of noodles they were.  The waitress started giving us an education in noodles in a rude tone.  I was just taken back and annoyed that I really wanted to just walk out.  I just wanted to know what it was.    We ordered an order of Tottie's Rolls and Pad Thai.  The description of the egg roll, said it may be the best you ever had.  When the dish arrived to our table, the bottom of the egg rolls were soggy and the meat inside was soggy and really wet.  Therefore, I can only assume these were frozen and placed into a fryer that wasn't at the right temp.  They lack taste and still doesn't compare to my mother's Thai recipe.    The Pad Thai was really wet and really sweet and didn't taste like Pad Thai.  Probably the second worse pad Thai dish I've ever had, next to Pei Wei. All in all we've had better, service and food.  I would recommend going somewhere else.  For two individuals that are Asian and have friends/family that have restaurants, we were far from being impressed.

Gammage is a wonderful venue for huge musicals!    Last week, I got to see Mama Mia, thank you Yelp for the complimentary tickets.  We sat in Row 24 , Seats 46/48 and we had a great view of the stage. The people next to us left before the 2nd half, what the french toast!  It's Mama Mia!    I've gone to Lion King, by myself and sat in row 13 in the middle and it's just as good, if not better.    I actually went to ASU, and performed on that very stage and love the fact that not only do big names perform there but also local performers and ASU students etc.  Yes, parking is not great, but really is it anywhere?  I usually go early enough to find parking, around 6 or 6:30ish and hang out, have a drink and just chill.  Even after the show, just wait about 20 to 30 minutes and you avoid a lot of the traffic.  Gammage is an unique building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and if you are visiting the Phoenix area, it is a place to consider checking it out.

One of the owners of the agency I work for came in from Tampa this past week, and wanted to check out the night life and the men.  So I had heard this was the place to be.  -Lots of parking and you can always take the light rail -There are actually 4 clubs in that area, including Downtown and a Latino/Salsa club, so if you are not into men checking out men, you can go to the other clubs. But do have to say, the bartenders are hot!  -The music was good. -No cover, which means more money for drinks! -PACKED by 11pm -One restroom with really long lines, it's kinda worth it to pay cover for the Latino club, so I can use the restroom! -Really mixed crowd of young, old, gay/lesbian, straight and some out of towners who were having a great time.  All in all, we had a good time there.

Located close to Arizona Science Center, I decided to have a late lunch by myself at Bianco.  A little pricey from one person, but I was tired and just wanted a good meal.  I sat at the bar and the cute waiter took care of me.  Everyone has told me that you would have to wait for hours to get in, I didn't.    I watched the two Italian chefs make the pizzas.  It was hard to tell if they were actually Italian but they both had a heavy moustache like Luige from Mario Brothers.  The Margarita was done perfectly.,  The crust is thin yet  not too crispy.  The sauce hot and sweet.  I think I would have prefer the basil be chopped and spread all over the pizza, I mean you are paying over $15 for the pizza!  I was satisfied and took half of the pizza back to the office.  However, a co worker was hungry so I shared.    Will need to go back and try their salads!

Ok, so I've gone a few times now.  First time, great experience but now this is what I think.  1. Over priced ..the green salad..greens and 3 green olives...bland dressing..$6..pizzas good but really not worth the wait nor cost.  2. Requesting Parmesan will cost you $2, and they will not let  you take it unless you request it. 3. Customer service, I've had really better service other places. This past week, I was in there for a lunch meeting and this group of 25 came in complaining they couldn't sit together, giving our small table dirty looks and sarcastic comments geared towards our table.  The waitress was staring us down  the entire time on and it was a really uncomfortable feeling, especially when you are paying a high menu price for the food .  I will be taking my business somewhere else, Bianco is just not worth it nor the wait time.

I love the building and the ambience of the restaurant.  A great place for a business lunch.  We did arrive early to get a table for six.  The staff was friendly and helpful when looking at the menu.  Some coworkers ordered the couscous salad, I had the pastrami and onions hot sandwich. Really good.  Lots of meat, cheese and onions.  I will need to come back and try the pizzas and salads.  Price is decent and our glasses were always full.

FEZ Rocks!  Went there last night again, and it's always been great.  The good thing about FEZ is that not only is the food great, but the staff is friendly, unlike another new restaurant down the street ...lacks..I had there special of Macaroni and Cheese!  We sat outside even though it was only around 55 degrees, still great!  A Must if you're visiting Phoenix!

On a rainy Sunday morning, Chelsea's Kitchen  sounded really good.  Unlike other brunch places, they open at 9:30 am which is GREAT! Because I love getting up early, grabbing the paper and having a leisure Sunday morning, reading about all the sales and news.    The servers were great. They brought a French Press pot of coffee to the table and even came back to pour the first cup.  Really good, and only for $2.50.  I was sold!  I ordered the eggs benedict with bacon instead Canadian bacon.  Plus a side of tomatoes and avocado.  The plate came out pretty quickly.  The yoke was a bit over done, and the sauce , not enough of it.  But it was tasty!  The English muffin was delicious!  The eggs came with a bowl of fruit.   The environment was great, they had the fire going and really easy going music playing, making it a great Sunday morning.    I will have to bring some other yelpers to join me on a Sunday, would love to try the white sangria, without being called a lush!

First time to the Irish Pub, we went on a rainy friday night and actually found parking and a table, I think that's pretty uncommon for Rosies in a good way.  My drink was weak but the food was pretty good!  Our server was great, very patient and also since our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, warned us about the portions, that was very kind of her.  Very comfortable atmosphere and a great centrally located pub/restaurant.

Where else can you rent dvds or cds for free!  Wi-fi is free and as long as you want. There's even a cafe downstairs if you really need a pick me up. The second level has a good selection of magazines and newspapers if you need to look at a past issue for school or work.   Get inspired by all the books or just by the views of the city on the top floor!

Wow! I never had been in Sprouts till I had to take my grandfather to the store.  We went through all the rows of nuts, seeds, sweets and dried fruits.  Sprouts has a great assortment for the munchies. Healthy ones too!  The veggie area was clean and had great sales going on.  This past week, 88 cents for certain veggies.  However, there wasn't a huge variety of breads and the fruit juices were way overpriced.  The store itself was really clean and the staff was really friend.  We didn't go through all the rows, so will just have to go back by myself to shop.

i heart the Metro Light Rail.  Public transportation seems to become a bit easier to deal with these days in Phoenix.  I can take a bus on Camelback and 16th Street to the Light Rail on Central and Camelback and be downtown Phoenix within 20 minutes.  If you are going to downtown Phoenix, I would recommend taking the light rail if possibly.  One it's cheaper than parking in one of the garages which cost anywhere from $8 to $12.  Besides being a good price, you can people watch the whole time on the light rail.   I've seen a grown man in a black and white business suit on the light rail with a Dr. Who lunch pail, two strangers making out on the way to the east valley and a bunch of old men coming from Occupy Protest coming on the light rail and complaining about people dressed up and coming from Tour de Fat. with their bikes. "What the hell are you from?" one said to a woman dressed up as a fairy. Never a dull moment.    Life is about having adventures, riding the light rail..you will have something to talk about.

Some say it's not really a lake, well I don't think of the sandy areas of Michigan Lake as beaches in Chicago either, but at least it's a place where there's water in the Phoenix Metropolitan area.  I love rollerblading in the mornings around the lake and taking strolls in the evening especially in the fall.  One can even kayak or sail on the lake too. The light rail is close by therefore, if you are coming for Downtown Phoenix, you can hop on the train and travel to the lake and surrounding areas.  It's very clean and there's lots of festivals and events that happen here year round.  Definitely a place to visit if it's your first time in Phoenix.

Who doesn't love their nuggets!  I love Chick Fil A nuggets.  I usually go get a quick order during lunch. It's faster to go inside than the drive through.  The staff is always friendly and says "Hi" or "Welcome".  The dining area is always clean and always full during lunchtime.

So needed a massage and decided to check out Massage Envy.  I have a few friends that are members and love it.  Not ready to become a member, I went in just wanting a good massage and willing to pay for their service.  The location is clean and the rooms are small..bright light, music in the background..nothing to make the experience memorable or a calming Zen moment.  The staff was nice however, did not seem to care either way who was coming in and out.   My massage was less than great.  The first 30 minutes, he "aligned" my back with pressure or what I would call "lets place my hands on her back ..tap certain areas...push in certain areas for 30 minutes..do nothing else" ..no lotion on his hands and when he rubbed I could feel it.  I kept thinking..I hope it gets better cause this is what I'm paying for?    The second 30 minutes, it was fast rubbing on my back, legs and feet.  At least he was using oils or lotion!  I felt somewhat relaxed for a short time however, was probably the worst experience I've ever had.   Would I recommend Massage Envy, no.  I'm not envious of those that pay month after month to be a member and still have to have pay for each session At least I only paid $39 because if I paid what I thought I would pay I would be really upset.

So a friend of mine went here last Friday, and they were double charged.  The bartender took advantage of the situation and threw out the receipt to avoid cancelling the $60 amount. Which she claims and assumes was her tip (on a $60 bill). "I get a 100% tips!" umm..yeah.. I think I will skip this place for sure!

Greek night with friends on the westside.  I had the lamb sowlaki which was ok, I've had better.  The portions were a good size however not that tasty.  Speaking of tasty, the water tasted funny too. The fried zucchini that we had tasted like it came from the freezer. And the baklava was probably the worst I have had in Arizona.  Really soggy and the cinnamon was overwhelming.  Staff nice yet didn't seem to care to be there and working.

Nice setup, hard to find a parking spot, and the food, too american to be consider real Asian food especially the Pad Thai, terrible!  Need I say more. Other restaurants in the area that are so much better in so many ways.

Horrible customer service!  I would've given a zero if it was possible.  I brought someone who was new to Arizona and spoke highly about Sanctuary and Jade Bar however, was utterly disappointed on this visit.    We were ignored in the bar area by all servers who literally were serving guests in front of us and to the side of us .  We were trying to make eye contact but was totally snubbed.  One of the bus boys actually stopped and gave me a menu.  We waited patiently for 15 minutes to get the attention of a server not only did they ignore us, we ordered at the bar and honestly we could have walked out without paying.  Just very disappointing experience.  And honestly, if you were not blonde nor older, you weren't served nor greeted.

Who's got the munchies!!!!! Friday and Saturday nights till 3 am, Mrs. White's is servin' up some yummy munchies including Fried Zucchini around $3 and entrees for $13.  I had to have their fried chicken , pork chop and some gravy and rice at 12am! The fried chicken was cooked perfectly.  The skin is crispy and tasty.  The meat moist and tasty.  The portions are huge and you will not go home hungry.  The staff is friendly and helpful; always a pleasure to talk to them.  Skip Filibertos or Jack n' Box after the party..movie..concert..and go to Mrs. White's!

Hungry at lunchtime? India Palace has a great Indian buffet for around $10 pending on your beverage.  Since it's a buffet, you can enjoy eating rather than waiting to be served.  Staff has always been friendly.  Besides the buffet, you do get a basket full of Naan bread.  It's a huge restaurant so bring your all your hungry co-workers!  Tandoori chicken is spicy and tender.  I do like the potato and cabbage dish, rice and the spinach saag.  Some of the reviews say it's not totally authentic, well it pleases my palate therefore I will be back!

I admit, I don't have a Costco membership but my grandparents do!     We went to get my grandmother a new pair of glasses however, Costco's Vision Center does not provide lenses prescriptions over 350.  Therefore, we had to go somewhere else.    I always like walking through the aisles and stopping by the sample carts, unfortunately the day we went, there was only one cart.  Big bummer!  Veggies are located in this "frig" area, very cold when you walk into it. The selection of produce was great however, some of it seemed way over priced.  The bread and bakery selection is probably my favorite area.. so many choices! And healthy ones too.  While walking around, I noticed the lights they used were making me feel a bit off and I didn't like that feeling. We didn't stay that long, but it's always an adventure when going to Costco.

WOW! The most cleanest hiking trail I've ever seen anywhere!  Lots of unprepared tourists hiking the mountain as well as residences of Troon.  It's not a tough trail, therefore easy on those that never hike.  Many of the plants along the trail have informational signs about the plant which is cool if you have never seen a cactus or desert plants.    The views are beautiful especially in the Spring with the flowers in bloom. If you have guests coming from out of town and want to experience a hike, an easy one, this is the one to take.  It's about an hour from Central Phoenix but worth the drive.

Chakra has a very cute little cafe which I really enjoyed my first time there.  The day before, I had a steak for dinner..shhhh..however, really wanted a veggie filled meal for lunch.  I ordered the Pesto Basil Focaccia (tomatos, olives, peppers, feta) with a mixed green salad with a zesty lemon dressing. I loved it.  Lots of flavor and the bread itself was moist and light with a crispy bottom.  Cost was somewhat high I thought ($15) when ordering, yet it was really good and what I wanted so I was ok with the price . It did take awhile for it to come out, however, I wasn't in a hurry though.  The tea of the day was a strawberry green tea.  Very good, light on the strawberry so it didn't taste like a juice.  I did purchase some Vanilla rooibos tea and a cherry black tea.  Only complaint and being a Tea Snob with over 3 years working in the Tea industry and 80 hours of training, the teas should be in air tight light tight containers; keeping the air out keeps the teas fresh (green teas will go badly quickly!)  Chakra staff was very helpful and friendly.  I will go back to purchase herbs and teas in the future.

I DO have a Crush on Christopher's and the lounge!    Located in the back area of the Biltmore Fashion Park, sits Christopher's and Crush Lounge, five stars all the way.  I have had the burgers, pizza, drinks/wines, and the amazing truffle oil fries.  And let's not forget, sweet potato fries with a spicy mustard sauce, so good, and you can't stop eating them.    Happy Hour is great , a huge serving of the fries is under $4!  You can get some fries and a pizza for about $10, and it's tasty.  There are about 3 to 4 types of pizzas, 2 types of fries, so many choices for drinks, and the burgers are savory and charbroiled... I think, I'm not sure, but I am sure they are worth it and I devour them every time I have had one!   I haven't been there for weekend brunch or dinner, but I do think it's really worth trying it out.  The staff is attentive and friendly, so overall, one must start to have a crush with this place, even if it's just Happy Hour because I can't see how it can ever be a disappointment for dinner or brunch.

I am expressing my great DISAPPOINTMENT with the service I received from The District in October 2009.    In the beginning of October, I approached The District to see if it would be possible to bring about 70 to 100 people on a Thursday night at around 10:30 p.m..  Not only did they say it would be great, they would have drink specials and have the happy hour menu available to our guests. And also, the manager had told me and another colleague there's hardly any business on Thursday, so it was great to have an organization interested in having a mixer at The District.  Thursday night came, the level of customer service and professionalism that the manager gave us was HORRIBLE!  The way he treated me, others and the fact that we brought about 70 to 100 people there itself was definitely something to remember.  NOT only did they lie about accommodating our large group obviously The District could not do so, nor did the management team care to do so.   The place was already crowded with other guests which is great for them HOWEVER, the manager never tried to accommodate all our guests which they knew we were coming! ...for seating, passing out menus..the only way people were able to order if they were seated which they couldn't,  some individuals were waiting a very long time for a drink that cost $15, there were no drink specials besides the beer and possibly the wine, I never I saw the menu, but I do know people were not happy with purchasing a tiny drink for $15 a pop! The manager did speak to another individual with my guests at one point and had told him, individuals can not get drink specials at the bar, however, there was nowhere to sit , the majority of the tables were already pre occupied.   Also, the executive director of the non profit organization that I work for had ordered just a Dr. Pepper, he gave the bartender a $20, received the drink and never received his change, when he asked the bartender, the bartender took his name down and did not give him his change.  HE HAS YET TO RECEIVE HIS CHANGE FOR A DR. PEPPER.    I never received a thank you for bringing people to The District that night.  IT WAS VERY DISORGANIZED AND VERY UNPROFESSIONAL TEAM AT THE DISTRICT.   Also, the manager had said to me and the executive director  that we would receive free valet parking since we were at The District, we had to pay over $40 for parking.   It was a very frustrating night.   Bottom line, we truly did not feel welcome at The District.  I was put in the predicament where I had to clear up confusions and make my guests feel welcomed.  At one point had considered having a kickoff party and/or mixers at The District, bringing over 100+ guests, but after the customer service/treatment everyone received from the management team and wait staff, I am now reconsidering ever utilizing The District and the Sheraton. As for myself, I was very disappointed and had expected great service. THIS IS THE FUNNY PART!  I did receive (a week later) an email from Heinrich Stasiuk, District GM.  Very insincere apology, THE FUNNY PART...he attached the email to the ongoing inside conversation between the managers stating I was difficult (sorry but you promise me certain things, should be able to keep it!) also stated in the email "but they made good money from us" .if you are a business or non profit organization trying to find a place to hold your mixer or dinners, I hope either you reconsider or let them know you've read my review!  Since I was difficult, I'm sure they will remember me and the fact they probably made about $3000+ off of my guests.

Yardhouse at Westgate, didn't disappoint.  First, the hostess placed us in a booth away from the noise of the sports games and music, very considerate!  Second, the ceasar salad was the best I've had in a long time, chrispy roman, great tasty dressing, yummy.  I usually get the Mac and Cheese which is always awesome and went with Sirlon with Portobello Mushroom, Mashed Potatoes, and Grilled Tomato, it was worth it, and had it with a pretty good glass of beer with it..yum.  Server was really nice and allowed us to linger at the table after dinner for awhile.    Tasty meal for a cool winter Phoenix night!!

The decor changed but the service didn't ..unfortunately!    So I've been here before on a first friday late night, it's great if you are with a small group of people and want a drink and something small to eat that's spicy.  However, this time around, I was with a bigger group  (8) and the service was totally below par..can you tell me when I'm getting my other dish..server.."Um.I don't know, I'm just serving"  ....and the food, yeah it's good if you want everything with chile oil sauce in it.  The tofu with sesame sauce was good, but still spicy like everything else that we had that evening.  Very disappointing for the price of each tapas.

What closes early on a Friday night in Scottsdale? DD does!  Without knowing it, we went there later in the night, not knowing what time they close-9pm.  We weren't really greeted by a hello or welcome but more like look at their watch and a sigh.  We said sorry, "Can we still come in or not, it's ok?" They still sat us.   And we waited and waited, never greeted or acknowledged. Waiters racing back and forth never looking our way.  The place was full so not sure if this was their way to get rid of us.  Five minutes later,  we had to ask for our waitress which the one that seated us raced by our table several times ignoring us all together.  The only person that served us was the bartender.   She was the only bright person in the entire place!   We ordered two drinks and the portobello and brie fondue plate.  Drinks were great.  The dish on the other hand was a bowl of what looked like soup, pieces of bread and badly cut pieces of tomatoes, cucumbers and carrots. None of the plate really looked good but we ate it. Very salty fondue. Not enough bread.   Wasn't impressed.  Oh and there were typos in the menu!

Express MiE is truely a place where women can go to either find their inner sassy & sexy selves or feel more confidence and peace with one's self through the various classes available.   With a blend of dance, individuals can take 4 classes for just $30 (1 hour each) like Yoga Booty Ballet, Glee with Mie and so many others.  The classes do vary month to month.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  I'm currently taking Level 1 Pole class and loving it.  Speaking with other women that have taken pole classes at other gyms/locations.  MiE is like no other. Yes, there is a pole, and you do get to learn how to spin on the pole correctly and safely vs. just for fun so you can show off at the bars to the boys.  A Pole-A-tease class is offered for only $30 and is a great way to enjoy a girls night out.  I wont' give all the secrets out on what happens in our classes but it's a blend of dance, mediation and stretches    I can tell you that my body is benefiting from greatly and I will continue with the pole classes in the future.    So if you really want a different way of working out and feeling healthier and gain maybe some self confidence , try some of the classes at Express MiE.

Wow! Brio seems to be the 'place' for happy hour at the Scottsdale Quarter.  Packed and having to wait for 15 to 20 minutes for happy hour seems odd.  Happy hour was only available in patio/bar area and we had to wait.  With only 30 minutes to order, we were given a table outside, a very small table.  We ordered a few plates plus I had ordered dinner , a filet with mash potatoes and roasted veggies.  The server was good but seemed overly busy.  Other staff members that came by to serve the appetizers were not very helpful, just in a hurry to drop off the food and rush off.  We had tried to ask for an extra fork and ignored.  My friend received a different wine than ordered and again the server just rushed off.  I received someone else's filet dinner, the filet was basically rare inside.  Our small table was filled with plates since we had to order quickly to receive the happy hour prices.  Happy hour prices were great but I would advise getting there early.

I've been here a few times, and we've had issues before but this takes the cake!  We sat in the private area due to the amount of people already dining.  Totally fine, Brio does have a nice private/patio area with a fireplace. After sitting for awhile, my friend found feathers in my hair which was really odd.  But then, a bird pooped on my arm- it is good luck and we were in an Italian restaurant.  The dove was stuck up in the rafters and could not leave the area.  The server did know the bird was in the rafters, but didn't seem to care either way.  I didn't make a big deal out of it, just odd.   I moved to another chair and below the chair was a woman's feminine product-wrapped.  Again, odd.  Then we got our food.  The roasted chicken was pretty dry and over cooked.  This is the second time, I've ordered a meat entree and both times, the meats were under cooked or overcooked.  To top the night, I chip a tooth.   I'm not sure if I will go there again, never really a great experience.

It's a hidden treat for Phoenicians bat lovers.  Located in the Biltmore/Camelback area, people can take a short walk to the cave..really it's a tunnel.  There are signs with details about the bats.  We went the night of the super moon and it's pretty cool to see the bats fly out of the tunnel and start flying over the canal to feed.  There were hundreds of bats coming out of the tunnel the night we went.  It was hard to capture a photo since they fly so fast! Just a few families and couples were there that evening.  It's nice it's not too well known but worth an evening walk.

If you are on a tight budget, one can find some great buys here if you go at the right time. Weekends..don't go.  Weekdays ..early mornings when they are stocking up YES!  Pretty clean and the staff has always been friendly.   I recently went and got cabbage, green onions(giant), 5 avocados, spinach, sweet peppers, mushrooms, chopped onions, Kraft shredded cheese(don't buy any other..it doesn't melt!) and some other stuff for only $16! And I made a tasty quiche with what I got that day! Who says you can't make yummy entrees with a tiny budget!   Certain items I would not buy eggs, meats, some of the breads.. but if your cashflow isn't that great lately, toilet paper, silverware, and a pair of sandals "your grandpa" style ....ONLY 99 CENTS!

When I'm sick, I get Pho Tai and add a lot of spice! Knocks it right out of me, and for only $5..ummm yeah!  I love this place, with such a great variety of choices, it can be a bit overwhelming.  It's Vietnamese and made to serve the Asian community.  Don't expect it to be in any way to be suited for american taste buds.  Those with an international taste buds will appreciate the flavors of the entrees.   Cheaper than some fast food joints and with veggies served on the side who can pass up a bowl of Pho or Bun for under $10!

I've been meeting friends for the past two weeks at the cafe for projects.  Nice cafe, descent mochas..little pricey for a medium mocha and rice krispy treat, $7 all together, but then again you do get free wi fi!  Service is good, the girls liked to flirt with my male friends, which 'Hey" it will make the boys tip well and passing out free samples does help sell the food!  Even though it seems pricey, it' has good drinks, clean tables, friendly staff, "free" wi-fi..hopefully it won't go out of business anytime soon!

My family is from Northern part of Thailand, therefore I was happy just by that AND they have STICKY RICE!  And I've been to many Thai restaurants around town, and I judge them by how the prepare Thai Steak Salad..THE BEST IN TOWN!!!  Of course with Sticky rice!    Yes, the service can be slow at times, but it's authentic people, and home made! Its not supposed to be a buffet or quick service, enjoy the food....enjoy the friends and family you're dining with....huge tables-it's awesome....enjoy the experience, enjoy the fact it's not a chain restaurant, or made by American standards, it's Thai..spicy and uber tasty hotness..... enjoy the fact it's in central Phoenix!!!

This hip little pizza joint has me coming me for some great eats.  The interior is "interesting" but I do enjoy looking around while waiting for my order.  On more than one occasion, I've ordered the White Pizza and some yummy fried mushrooms.  It's a bit warm during the Summer to eat inside the restaurant but during fall , it's nice to hang out and enjoy the scene.  Last time I was there, a adorable kid was playing the uke and singing.  That put a smile on my face.

Been here a few times, and haven't been disappointed at all!     Servers have always been friendly; this past time there, the GM (I'm assuming) came by when we were done and took our plates.it was actually a busy Friday lunch crowd, so nice to see their attentiveness to their guests as well those waiting for a table.  I am in love with their Brussels Sprouts and Pancetta Pasta Dish, it has some spice in it as well, but it's basically brussels, pancetta, pasta in olive oil and Parmesan..yummy..  The bread served is yummy, I think it's better than Olive Garden's! And it's served with olive oil and balsamic , great way to start the meal.   They do have an happy hour special, that's next, but it's not over priced for a good plate of pasta, salads, or pizzas..so enjoy!!

Last month, my ol' escort wagon got its back window smashed in the Christown Harkins Parking lot.  Harkins really didn't care but the customer service at Blue Chip was just great!  I had spoken to them about the car and to see what my options were. They do work only Monday through Friday however will come to you to fix!  I had told the woman on the phone, that I was calling around and will call back if I was interested.  So helpful on the phone!  Well I called another place that's on Yelp who receives a lot of 5's and had the total opposite experience.  No help, short sentences, rude and just didn't care.  Therefore, I went back to Blue Chip because of their customer service.  The owner who had been on vacation had called with a few more questions and to make sure I was taken care.  Going out their way for me was just great and did put my mind at ease that the car would be fixed perfectly.   One of their men came out to my work and replaced the glass in the morning.  Very reliable and easy to work  with! Thanks again Blue Chip team and owner!  Appreciate it!

WoW!  Located in the weirdest strip mall on the west side of town, is this piece of asian food heaven.   There's a Japanese restaurant, Cafe Ga Hyang, tattoo parlor, Siamese Kitchen then what looks like a heavy metal/rock bar..so strange but great at the same time!  Gotta love it!  They have an array of Chinese and Korean dishes which range from $5 for appetizers to $16.95 for one of their Korean dishes.  I had Kalbi dish, and it was delicious!  And I didn't share, because it was so good!   It's a small restaurant, however, friendly staff and just great food to enjoy with friends and family!

I love hot dogs...regular, corn dogs and my favorite Chicago dogs! This place becomes pretty busy during weekday lunch time but offers great specials!  The Hot Dog Stop does have grilled and steamed dogs.  Also, they offer some great sides like fried mushrooms!  If you are looking for a quick and inexpensive lunch, you should check this place out.  It's worth the stop!

Water Glass Harmonica needs to be at this amazing museum!  Since birth, I think I was in love with music and musical instruments and I'm so happy the museum is in Arizona.  From Latin horns, African drums, to the various bag pipes found in European countries(who knew there were so many!) to a display of all the Indonesian puppets, the world history of musical instruments can be seen at MIM.  I would have preferred it if I wore tennis shoes instead of heels however I was at the Brazilfest 2011.   The event is probably the reason I'm giving MIM 4 stars instead of 5.  It's really cool to have events at the museum, however, the set up for the Brazilfest, just didn't flow.  Plus, the bar area didn't know how to make a caipirinha , it was so sour I couldn't finish it. And the servers were not that friendly.   So I got a glass of wine ($6) and it wasn't even a half a cup.  And there was no food!  I prefer the Brazilian events in Tempe @910 versus at MIM; different vibe, too much talking and mingling versus enjoying the performers and talking to each other like you do at 910. Hey, if I'm not enjoying my 4th caipirnha and dancing until 2 am, then going to IHOP at 3am,  it's not a good Brazilian party. So I'm thinking this is not the place to have an event.  The museum is definitely worth the entry fee. Don't forget the tennis shoes!

Lao Thai is pretty authentic Thai food found in South Scottsdale.  I went there after a Yelp Cocktail event with some other yelpers for a quick bite.  It was late and we were the only ones there for awhile.  The cost for the entrees were reasonable and the food was good.  I had ordered Drunken Noodles with Chicken.  I wasn't sober so the noodles helped soak up all the Jack!  And they had sticky rice, which I always have to order to soak up all the sauce goodness!  Overall good experience, I would go again and again.

LOVE their Chicago Dog!  The food is well priced and made well, the breads, meats and veggies are wonderful.  The service has never been bad, and always friendly.   If you like meat and even not, there are salads, skip Paradise across the street and try this instead!

Since I've heard all about this place and it's down the street from me, I decided to visit Ken's and see what's up with this place. Really great service and the price is reasonable.  I just got a mani that day but it was a nice relaxing 1/2 hour talking to the manicurist and getting my nails cleaned and polished.  I will have to go back for a pedi, my feet are needing one badly!

Gee, I felt like I was in Phoenix instead of Snottsdale!  Great show with headliner Warren B. Hall, who grew up in Phoenix!  He is hilarious and truly a "funny man" meaning he knows how to tell jokes with imagination and without so much vulgarity and he doesn't overly curse throughout the show to make the act seem cool and funny. He will definitely get his own show one day.  And it's only $15 per person and worth the amusement.  Drinks were drinks but it's more about the feel of the place, more intimate setting unlike another new comedy club which packs the herds in.  Definitely, if you like stand up comedy, try out this place, kinda deceiving decor outside, it's dark out front and you don't know which door to go through but all in all, good experience!

Liqueur or Ice Cream?  What?! I don't have to decide which one to have, it comes together AND I can try any of the flavors BEFORE I buy my cup...well, ok, if you say so!  Choices included the following liqueurs-vodka, tequila, Kahlua, and Bourbon.  I went with the Chocolate Bourbon ice cream.  I loved it!  Friends of mine had one with vodka which one of them kept saying " I can't taste the vodka!"However, this is the same person, who has had two apple vodka drinks and kept saying it was just apple juice not drinks therefore, Lee's is doing something right with the vodka in the ice creams!  It's a small location yet seems to work for the area.  The staff there was friendly and helpful.  And you get a punch card, "Buy 8 scoops, get one FREE".

OMG, call me FULL of schnitzel!   I feel like Beaver Choice is kinda hidden in a strip mall, and only a few (yelpers and Scandinavians) actually know about the restaurant.  And that's ok with me.  A small mom and pop's restaurant is definitely a popular place where people can dine, discuss the day's happenings and even play games while waiting for their lunch or dinner.  OH, and you can bring your own wine!    I had the pork schnitzel with a mushroom cream sauce, dill mashed potatoes, green beans, steam broccoli and tomato basil salad.  Nothing was left on my plate.  We also had the fries with the cheese curds and gravy and malt vinegar.    But wait, you must have some dessert! I had the chocolate brownie pie with fresh cream and strawberries , and I ended up taking some of the cookies and these balls made of chocolate, coconut, oatmeal called beaver balls home.  Friendly family staff, loved the fact that if there was an argument between family members in the dining area, it was in Swedish or German ..not sure which.  It just added to the charm.  Will be back for the Swedish meatballs!

Cover was $10($6 for women) to get into the place.  It was a nice set up, didn't realize you could eat there, and I don't think I would want to, it was so loud.  The attire that the bartenders and servers were wearing just seemed out of place.  Hardy meets Guns n'Roses. And the girls with the clip on bows in their hair..what's the point!    Drinks ..not cheap and not that strong.  We went "outside" in the patio area and just got a vodka and 7up and a beer..a Coors beer, it was $14..seriously and for a Coors!    Needless to say, I don't think Sandbar will last.

SaBai Dii!!    Located in a Wendy's building and it was a nice set up inside!  They had a huge bar table (some type of brown stone)  in place of where the register area would be.  As usual, I have to try their steak salad.  The owners were there and greeting and serving.  I got to try their "house" soup which was in some kind of chicken broth with soy sauce, lot's of white pepper and chunks of veggies.  Decent.  I had asked for the steak salad not to be so runny because it can be made really wet and/or too spicy and I just don't like it!  And probably because my mom makes some of the BEST Thai steak salad ever and every Thai restaurant I test to see how theirs match up to hers!  It was good not the best, but I would get it again for sure.  It's more Americanized than some other Thai places however, it was good.  I hope it stays around!

I went with another Yelper who had gone to the Yelp event at Citizen's, however, we didn't have the same experience as she had at the Yelp event.    We had cups of iced tea (Starbucks)  that the hostess didn't say we couldn't bring in, a server just came by and was about to take them until we asked why..  I asked how a particular drink was..was it sweet, the waitress said it was more savory which I thought well it sounded good..umm skip the Aviation, even had my friends try it and they too thought I should send it back however I got the feeling that I would be charged for the drink and charged again for whatever else I ordered, so I let it sit on the table and see how long it would take the waitress to notice..never did..another server/busboy came by to take my plate, and I just told him to take the drink, he never questioned nor asked what was wrong..all in all poor service.  We had the mussel chowder..skip it!  The 8 mussels makes the bowl look full, underneath, hardly any leeks and potatoes but a lot of celery! And the chowder was really runny. And for $9, seriously for mussels which are one of the cheapest seafood to purchase.  When I was going to the restroom, I noticed to ladies totally bored and annoyed, just sitting side by side with just water in front of them.  I thought to myself, have they been served or asked??  I walked back out and they were out the door pretty quickly.  Would I go back? Umm..no..the pricing of the food is similar to Fez and other foodie spots and reasonable, however the quality and the quantity not so much....oh..and the service..I've had better.

I don't get to the west side that much but  when I do, Rita's is on my list!  The staff was friendly and the place was packed from 6 pm on with families and teenagers.   I ordered a sundae.  I know sounds lame compared to getting a Mistor or Gelati. But vanilla custard with Reese's peanut butter cups and hot fudge topped with whipped cream and a cherry, is  awesome.    The price is affordable for what you get and I would recommend trying Rita's out.  There is a location in Tempe as well.

This past Friday, I was downtown with some friends, one who had turned 40 and had never been to a comedy club before, so why not!  Tickets were only $22!  Wow, ok, to see comedians from Chealsea Lately show, ok why not!    We received 2 for 1 drink passes to go to the bar next door and they would give us a buzzer to get in prior to people waiting in line.  Ok that seems like a great deal!  Umm..the 2 for 1 has to be the same drink, the waitress somewhat rude, and kept asking if we wanted food..nor did she tell us that we can bring the second drink into the show with us..9:45 came and went, and they were still not allowing people in.    When we finally got in, we got center area in the second seating area, so people were walking past us all the time!  And I mean ALL the time even with the comedians performing!  Seriously, people don't have to get a drink that much! At least , do it between acts!   But no, all through the show.   So our waitress, rude and just unfriendly..2 drink min., of course some prices were not on the menu..a coke $3 in a plastic cup, seriously!  And then I was asked at least 2 times,to get my 2nd drink,  during the acts! Seriously, can I watch the show!  I just asked for a bottled water to go, she came back with the cap off, so I asked for the cap and she did bring me a new one.  $5 for water.  I got the macaroni and cheese and it was just horrible for it to be $12..so our check was around $50. I wouldn't complain, if it was good but it wasn't at all.  And again, people in front of us the whole time! Even the waitress were standing in front of us, taking the peoples orders in front of us.  And like everyone else, we had to wait afterwards for the bill which already had the gratuity added, nor did we add more, service did not deserve it.   Comedians were ok, not as funny as I thought they would be.   All in all, I probably won't go back.  I went to StandUp Scottsdale and had a totally different experience for the better.  I would've thought this club was in Scottsdale  and Stand Up Scottsdale was located in Phoenix.

Clean Freaks UNITE!  For under $20, you can bring in your car in for unlimited washes.  For the summer months, you know we all need this deal!!  This location can get pretty crazy busy because it's fast and cheap!  For only $3, you can get a basic car wash.  I haven't stayed to clean the inside because these are usually being used however, I will be using them sooner than later.  If you are on a budget , this is a great place to get your car washed quickly and the staff has always been friendly and helpful!

Breakfast!!!    It was crazy busy the morning me and another Yelper went to NCounter.  Long line so I was told to order at the bar, still a long wait, actually I think it was longer...therefore just stay in the line.    I could've eaten the french toast AND Ncounter's Farmer's Market bene (2 eggs poached, spinach, tomato, avocado, hollandaise sauce and potatoes). Delicious!  The Farmer's Market bene that is!  I will have to go back for the french toast.  I also had ordered a mimosa.  More alcohol please next time.

The cafe is located in Arizona Center so you would think it would be packed with ASU students and individuals from conferences.  I ended up going there for work lunch thinking from all the choices available it would be an inexpensive lunch.  I ordered a half sandwich and soup with a drink.  It was over $10 and when I got the meal, it was less than impressive for the amount of money. A very little BLT half sandwich and broccoli and cheddar soup. Staff members were very friendly however, it was slow getting my meal and seems way over priced.

Very surprising that I would like Indian food without meats! I had to be in the area for classes and there wasn't a lot of choices in the area.  A co-worker had gone to the buffet before so I decided to join him for lunch.  The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean.    The buffet included salad, soups, two types of rice, and other dishes which I have no clue what I had but it was all good!  Lots of spices and a variation of veggies in the dishes, anyone would enjoy! We there two days in a row and the buffet had different dishes each time.  The price was reasonable and I never left hungry.    I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try something different and enjoy some great Indian dishes one may not have tried unless they went to Madas Ananda Bhavan.

Pizza People Pub is pretty awesome and has a great location in downtown Phoenix.  At Tour de Coops, I had seen their food truck, and my co worker ordered a pizza.  It looked really good that I knew I had to make a trip to the pub!  The day before Thanksgiving, me and Judy F. had a Thanksgiving Eve dinner at the pub.  Very inviting atmosphere with unique informal seating areas as well as outside seating is available.  A little cold outside right now, but can't wait when it's a bit warmer in the evening to sit outside.  I ordered the AZ Jackass, similar to a Moscow Mule.  Pretty tasty and it was a dollar off for happy hour!!  I could not resist ordering a mini mac!  It was so tasty with a crispy top and warm creamy middle.  My pizza had pepperoni and mushrooms and was a 10" pizza which I devoured all of it!  The crust was really really good.  However, they make it, it's probably the best that I've had in awhile, seriously!

Beer with brunch?  Yes, Beer Brunch on the weekends at O.H.S.O.! I've been here a few times this past year.  A few weeks ago, I decided to go and try their Beer Brunch, only $10 with a beer.  Yes, beer before noon but hey it is a BEER Brunch.  Nobody will judge you there!  The beer biscuits and gravy was awesome! Huge pieces of sausage in the gravy.  The biscuits were moist and buttery.  The gravy had a kick to it for sure but went really well with the beer.  I had ordered the Raspberry Wheat to go with the dish.  Loved it!  The dish came with two pieces of crispy bacon and a bowl of fruit.  I ordered coffee as well.  And the refills kept coming for the coffee.  Service was good..friendly and always coming by asking you were ok and needed anything else.   For only $10 it's a great place for a weekend brunch with friends or by yourself!

A "little" bar with HUGE personality.  This hard to find Arcadia bar is worth the search.  Just look for the Little Woody!  Hard Wood, Soft Wood, and Tongue n Groove are just some of the names of the specialty drinks.  I tried the tongue n groove (Collins, smashed strawberries to name a few of the ingredients) , kinda like an adult Shirley Temple. Also ordered the preztel knot which looked more like a big bun and small side of Beer Cheddar and Mustard.  It was good, but not worth $$ for what you get.  Little Woody has a good variety of beers starting at $5. The place was not crowded and we were able to talk at our table.  I can see it getting pretty packed and loud! Hopefully it stays somewhat a secret.  At the end of the night, we were not given 'The Bible' but a note book full of stories, lots of nude drawings , guests' names and other stuff..and yes I wrote in the book..look for Mooshu.  Worth the stop for a drink or two.

I love brunch on the weekends.  I love it even more when they open before 10 a.m. ! Wy-Knot opens at 8 a.m. and it was worth getting up early and there by 8:30.  By 9 a.m., the cafe was packed.  They cook to order so I would get there earlier than later.  I ordered the Wy-Knot Egg Benedict.  Creamy cheese hollandaise sauce over poached eggs, ham and a bacon cheddar biscuit with a side of veggies.  My only complaint is on the veggies, too much celery but I liked the mixed of green veggies.   I also ordered a pancake on the side, since I've heard raving reviews about them.  Very good. Moist and even the plain pancake had a lot of flavor to it.  Just make sure to order extra side of butter!   Wy go there? Cause it's freshly cooked, friendly customer service, fair pricing on the menu and favorable dishes.   Why not?  I don't have a reason, they even have vegetarian dishes available! So those wanting a tofu meal, they have some great choices.

Excited at first to try some Humble pies, however, my experience was a bit different than expected.  I went during lunch time, not as busy as it could be but a good crowd of lunch goers.  They have an "express" lunch menu for about $10..pizza and either soup or salad.  Well, service was really slow in getting the food out, especially a ceasar salad.  The salad came probably 15 -20 minutes later (seemed LONG), and then right after (like a minute!) the pizza.  The salad had HUGE chunks of celery which was weird to me since it's a Ceasar salad.  Tasty salad though minus celery.  The pizza, oven baked and thin.  Good not great.  Cheese was odd.  They had cleared my table and I was waiting for awhile, server had gone around my table yet too busy to come over and had to ask for the check.  Umm...if someone ordered on the express lunch menu probably means eat and go.  I was there for an hour or so, so not really express in my humble opinion.

Wow, awesome location and who doesn't like brats and beer!  I tried the beer brat with rootbeer sauteed onions. Who knew rootbeer and onions would be a perfect match-Chef Peyton!  The fries were ok, I wasn't a big fan of them but I did like the sauces that came with it.  Great assortment of brews to choose from besides brats.  It's even possible to take the brats home to grill and enjoy.  Love the outside beer garden, this will definitely be one of my hangouts in Old Town Scottsdale.

NYE, we attended the Lustre Bar Winter Wonderland NYE party.  We couldn't get a drink at the bar due to stressed out waitresses and a very crowded bar.  So we went downstairs for a drink at 12:30.  We were told that they already had last call and they were'nt making any more drinks!  Seriously, it's New Year's Eve! Plus the staff was rude and ignored people and talked to people they knew.  Really bad customer service especially if you wanted to impress guests and keep they're interest.  Blue Hound, you didn't succeed.  Hope you try better in the future.

Want to get a party poppin' With over 30 flavors to select from, one can find a flavor for any occasion.  I've been in there a little bit too much, getting snacks for the office as well as snacks for clients/meetings.  A mini is a great size to try out different flavors.    From savory selections like Beer Cheddar, Sour Cream and Chives, fruity flavors, Strawberry or Pineapple to sweet blends, Kettle corn and Butterfinger!  Love the Puppy Chow mixture of popcorn, chex mix and pretzel sticks in sweetness!    Can't decide? Try the Scottsdale blend...White Cheddar and Carmel, YUMMY!    Hidden inside the strip mall, totally worth checking out!

My new weekend breakfast joint! Love this location and a friendly staff that's always helpful and ready to serve you.  For breakfast, I've had the egg Benedict.  The first time the eggs were cooked perfectly, but the second time a bit over done.  Still yummy and worth the cost.  The biscuits and gravy were ok, not the best and a bit odd in taste-needed salt or seasoning.  I have not tried out their happy hour at this location.  I've tried it at Scottsdale location which I wasn't really impressed.  This location however, I really like and will keep going!

Cafe Rio just isn't up to par for Mexican food.  I ordered 3 tacos with steak/guac and a small drink, total $14!  Seriously, way over priced tacos for so little. The tortillas may be homemade but I can get tortillas just as good or better at other Mexican food establishments.  I had asked if I could get cheese on the top of the tacos, it would've cost extra.  You got to be kidding me!  The lettuce was poorly cut, huge pieces that makes it hard to eat it in a taco or even a salad.  Really messy prep area and the staff pretty much lazy about how they prepared the tacos and other guests meals.  People were not that friendly nor seemed to like their jobs.  Good location to be in, yet not worth the trip.

Working downtown, I have a lot of choices on where to dine for lunch.  I've been wanting to try My Mom's Thai Kitchen for awhile.  The lunch menu is pretty much the same as other Thai restaurants.   I selected Drunken Noodles with chicken.  Pretty spicy and tasty.  The amount of food on the plate was pretty minimal compared to other places.  Plus the cost is kinda high for what you get.  I would go back and try something else.  But compared to my mom's Thai cooking, there is no comparison.

Are you a Localist?  This event has been going on for a while and the new location is awesome especially when the weather is amazing.  There are still a lot of people that don't know about this event, which is surprising to me!    Lead by Local First, many local businesses come out for the day for a unique fall festival.  Many food trucks are now apart of the festival, and provide samples and yummy entrees for attendees.  Tickets are available for purchase to try samples from these food trucks and other local restaurants.   This is an event where us, Phoencians can learn about our local businesses and support them.      Only suggestion: An area for kids needs to be considered.  More adult oriented than family friendly.

Every Asian I know has posted pics of this place...yes in Phoenix Arizona you can find some Asian delishness!  I've tried the green tea and the original flavor but love my strawberry shaved ice! I've stuck with my favorite Strawberry with Chocolate and Coconut Mochi Balls. Not two sweet and just the right amount of sauce and toppings.  All of my friends have gone at least twice, it's an addiction!  The staff has always been friendly.  I've been there during a weekday mid morning and at night, people kept coming in to try Snoh.   Some who know about this type of shaved ice or just curious foodies!

Color Run is supposed to be the Happiest run however with the rain, it was cold and wet! Runners and walkers were not separated nor was it told in the beginning about etiquette. This was not a great set up for walkers and runners.   I couldn't run since my shoes were filled with water.  Without knowing it, the blue zone was basically a lake and the individuals at the zones really didn't seem happy.  The music was odd and not very motivating.  Great idea, bad execution even in the rain.   I hope the charities received the funds from the run, that's the purpose and the goal.

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and Matt sure likes his eggs and bacon in the morning hours!  I was actually able to get into their newest location and sit a the bar.  I'm not a big lady but the stools were tiny and I kept slipping off the stool.   The staff and service was great.  She was busy however able to fill up my coffee cup without being asked.  I ordered the omelet with cheddar, mushrooms and of course bacon with hash browns and white toast.  Surprisingly the toast and jam, I really enjoyed the most! The omelet was filled with melted cheese, grilled mushrooms and bacon.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and overall the dish was tasty.   Matt's prides itself for making everything from scratch or most of it.  And it is really good, if you are into traditional bacon and egg kind of dishes for breakfast.  The coffee was actually really good and didn't leave a bitter taste.    I would recommend getting there earlier than later due to Matt's reputation in the Valley. The place does get crowded even if it's in a bigger location.   Next time: Waffles!

So Ginger O and I went there for brunch.  We were the only ones there and it took probably 30+ minutes to get our food.  I got Eggs Benedict which didn't have any hollandaise sauce on it however the waitress gave the excuse that it was the "French" way...ummm to say it includes hollandaise sauce then making it invisible on your plate? The eggs were over cooked.  It was really hot in the restaurant. The service was bad, took forever for the food and they just didn't seem to care.  Then I found out the next day, Scratch closed. But that is no excuse for the bad service, go out with a bang..not a "lame" attitude.   Obviously we will not be going back.

Zensational is Z'Tejas!    So glad one has opened up in Central Phoenix!  So the Chambord Margarita is my new favorite drink there for sure.  Sweet yet not over sour like other margaritas they serve.    Our server or servers were awesome and on the ball the entire evening.  The evening started with two of us then grew to four.  We ordered off of the happy hour appetizers menu which were really great deals for what you receive.    Loved the dumplings! They were filled with chicken and mini shrimps then seared on the bottom in a cast iron skillet.  We the pork tostados were probably the least favorite of the entrees we ordered.  The trio nachos was a good appetizer to being with.   Overall , I had a great first experience at this location.  The only thing that really destroys the evening, is trying to find parking.  Other than that, this location is huge and looks like a great place with bigger groups!

Who cares if you have a muffin top the next day, Sweet Bake In at LGO was awesome!  So Anna M. and I were hanging out later by the cooler area by the gelato stand and I had gotten rid of my champagne glass.  A nice gentleman had gone all around the room that evening filling people's glasses, of course, I kiddie with him not having a glass anymore. He said if you have a glass I can pour...so the next time he came around, I presented him with a glass...well a gelato cup but it could still hold the champagne.  With a look and a grin he poured...twice ..then the third time he brought me a glass :-) Adorable! We thanked him for the evening and went on our way to dinner where he later showed up with more champagne for us.  Thank you Cole! We loved the muffins and you!

I love this old building and especially the outdoor bar area.  Plus it's close to work and has a great happy hour.  Last week, I went there with Linda W. and Ginger O. for my b-day dinner (last minute). They have great happy hour deals and so it's best to have the Vig on your social feeds so you can see what they are, because I always forget!  It's pretty much the same menu as the other Vigs in town.    On Mondays, I found out that the burgers are less than usual, so I got the burger with an egg, bacon, cheese on it.  It was awesome and I split it with Ginger because it was so big.    Our waiter overheard Linda saying it was my birthday, and without asking they made me a homemade brownie cake with ice cream on top.  It was awesome and thank you for the treat!   I will have to try out their brunch later on this Fall/Winter.  So glad the Vig made its way to the downtown neighborhood.

The Whining Pig seems much smaller than what the room I imagine in Alice in Wonderland would be but I like it!  Parking is limited.  Space is limited.  So if you are planning to make this a stop with 6 of your closet friends, I would recommend earlier than later.   A great selection of wine and beer are available.  I had ordered the chips and salsa and I would recommend skipping this and getting the meat and cheese plate instead.    Great place to meet new people or hang and talk to someone you haven't seen in awhile and catch up!

We ROC'd it! For the first year in Arizona , ROC race did it pretty well!  Kinda like Wipeout with inflatable obastacles along the 5k course.  We were lucky with the great weather a little wind helped with the walking.  Yes, you can walk, jog or run the course.  But why go fast when you can take your time, enjoy the weather, time with your friends and YOU NEED your energy when you try to complete the obstacles!    A few suggestions would be:  1. Water and food at the end of the finish line (provided, not for purchasing)  2. Some kind of medal or something for all participants  3. More photographers at the obstacles, having seen the photos on the official photography site, not really impressed and for the price, seriously!   Some of the obstacles are not that easy, I did accomplish the Wrecking Ball which wasn't as hard as some of the others.  Just big balls in your way and a very hairy man in a speedo with a really irritating voice to annoy you while you try to cross without falling in the brown water.    It was fun, however, we didn't stick around since the price of food and drinks were high.  It didn't feel like an after party, therefore, we went to a close restaurant which was filled with the racers.

Clever in charging a lot of underwhelming flavors is what I got from my visit.  The crowd is downtown hippsters, who want to be seen. The bar and the drinks were probably the best part of my dining experience.  Staff friendly and helpful.   I watched one of the owners on 3TV mentioned it's not an Asian fusion place..however, the decor is very Asian not the cooks! Very confusing. Regardless Clever Koi is Asian "inspired" however the dishes are not very flavorful, over priced and need salt and other spices.   The ramen was $13 for a little bowl.  The broth is the key.    It tasted like beef broth with a little bit of soy, very tasteless and I would not go again for it.  Kimchi Fried Rice...didn't taste like Kimchi.  The turkey leg..meh.  The buns were the only thing that was "good"  I would only go for the buns and the drinks.  Keep working on your flavors and regardless if it's something new and out of the box, it needs to be tasty and Clever Koi isn't there yet.

Out of shape or in shape, Yelp kicked our butts!   Yelpers were treated to a 60 minute class which included treadmill (power walking or running), rowing and various on floor exercises with a ball and bench.  A monitor was strapped to our chests to report the results which was pretty cool! I did better than I expected.   For someone that goes to the gym 2 to 3 times a week, this one really kicked my butt and it was great to have trainer there to push your limit even when you don't want to.  My abs are sore, my legs felt like jelly and I feel asleep by 8 p.m. , thank you Eric, thank you.     The only thing I really wanted to find out, but didn't was how much are the classes.  I would consider doing a class maybe two times a month, if it was reasonable.    Flower Child, was really good and since it's not far from my house I will be going probably once a month.  The prices were reasonable for what you receive and the quality of the food is top notch.     I had steak, brown rice and the wild mushrooms with brussel sprouts..sounds really dull compared to other Yelpers' dishes, but it was really good.  The avocado hummus spread is to die for and I had to ask for more pieces of bread..can't waste!   Thank you for the invite, it was a great event and more Yelp events should be like this...well maybe not all!
