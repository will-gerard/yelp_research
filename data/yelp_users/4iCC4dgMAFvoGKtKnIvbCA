I just moved into the area a week ago and I desperately needed something done to my outgrown ombre. I decided to come here due to the rave reviews. I came bright and early that way I had time in the day to run my errands. Right away, I was taken back to put on my robe and sit at my stylists chair - Karen. Karen was a wonderful lady. I showed her what I wanted and she got to work. Since I was basically doing highlights, I knew it would be a lot of waiting around. Next time, I would definitely take a book. Karen did a wonderful job at letting me know exactly what she was doing. I like that. It's my hair and I deserve to know what exactly is being done to it. Once she was finished, I loved the way the color turned out. When I went up to the register and she finally told me the final tally. I was in a bit of a shock. I've never done partial highlights and when I had my ombre done before, it wasn't that expensive. Next time, I would definitely ask more questions about how much this will cost before committing to it. All in all, my hair came out beautiful, so I would definitely come back.

This place is always worth the drive for me. I do suggest coming early because parking can get crazy especially on a busy weekend morning.   I've only had a simple breakfast platter, Breakfast Nachos, and their original Eggs Benedict. The Eggs Benedict is the best I've ever had. I have no idea what they put in their hollandaise since it's so addicting. To top it all off, they give you a huge cup of coffee rather than the miniature ones at every other restaurant. I don't know about you, but a giant cup of coffee is needed every morning during breakfast! If you aren't a fan of Eggs Benedict then try their Breakfast Nachos. It's heavenly.

I've been here twice and both times it was just okay.  The first time we came was on a beautiful afternoon. All we wanted was a snack since something was already cooking at home. We decided on the nachos. Were they amazing? No, but we still enjoyed it.   The next and most likely last time we went was for dinner. The girls up front were frazzled from how many people were there, that they were forgetting about people who asked for a table. At that point, I knew we weren't going to receive exceptional service. Finally, we were sat down. It took our waiter over ten mins to greet us. Ten minutes after that is when he gave us our drinks only to leave us before letting us place our order. At that point, I just wanted to eat and leave. Almost ten minutes later, he came back and took our order. Our food came out a bit cold. It wasn't amazing once again. For the prices, you would think it would be amazing, but it wasn't. The food was subpar and the customer service well, no where near extraordinary.

I was craving Ube Ice Cream (If you haven't tried some, definitely do!), so one day I yelped where I could get some. This place came up and it instantly intrigued me.   My husband and I finally went on Valentine's Day. The parking lot was crowded, but luckily it didn't take us long to find a place to park. Walking in we noticed that there were board games for customers to play while they enjoyed their treats. We love board games, so it was great to see that! My husband and I both shared a custom order with Ube Snoh and graham crackers. We didn't really do anything special because we mostly just wanted Ube. Hands down, it was delicious. It's like eating actual snow, but flavorful! Honestly, you're just going to have to visit this place to actually understand what its like to eat it. I'm really excited to come back because there no where else in the valley that does Snoh better!

I was back in town visiting my old stomping grounds when my friend suggested we have lunch here. And I'm definitely glad I accepted!   A cute eatery in walking distance of the Tempe campus so of course this place is packed during lunchtime. We arrived there shortly before the line was wrapped around the entire place. Thank goodness! (If you don't have time to wait, order ahead.) I've heard many things about the Acai bowl here and in this hot heat, I needed a cool down. Once it was delivered to our table, I wasn't disappointed! The bananas, the strawberries, coconut and everything else in it was just perfect.   It was a bit pricey. But what can you expect of a healthy joint? I would definitely come back again to explore the rest of their menu especially one of those delicious protein bowls!
