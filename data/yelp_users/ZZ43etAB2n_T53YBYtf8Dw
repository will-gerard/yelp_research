I really enjoy the atmosphere however the food is worse than a microwave dinner. I think the buy bing bags of stirfry from costco!!  We got there and they didnt seat us for 30mins. When there were tables. Then we got seated and didnt get the food for 1 and a half hours.   We kept trying to grab the witress but she would avoid us. Then we would ask othe waitresses and they said the would check.  People were coming and going that got there after us!!!  Finally I got aggressive with our waitress and we saw her walk to the chef and put in our order!!!  She forgot to put in our order!!!  Since she wanted to pretend like it was just taking a long time she fucked the whole order up because she was going off memory and couldnt ask us because then we would know.  The food came finally and it was all crap we didnt even order!!!  We told her to forget the whole thing we are leaving and not paying.  She grabbed her manager who told us.   "she is on thin ice with the owner who is right there. I can take it off the bill but there is a good chance we will get her fired. Or the waitress will pay for half out of her pocket"  WTF!!!!!!!!!!!  Of course I told her the whole meal needs to be free and it was extremely unprofessional that she would blame a waitress getting fired because we waited a total of 2 hrs for the wrong meals we didnt eat!!  It would have been rated a zero star but I gave it 2 because now they are a bar too and that portion is pretty cool.

I went here once for a drag king Contest. All the women were very over weight and not very entertaining.   The bar itself is the size of a shack and it is definetly for an older male crowd.  If you are a lesbian between the ages of 21-35 this is not your spot

When I first came here I thought the food was really good. Then it got worse everytime I came there. The rolls kept coming out soggy and cold and these were the tempura ones. When I asked them why the fried roll was ice cold, he said " it must have come out of the fridge last" WTF  Why would it be in the fridge? I kept asking him and he looked at me like I was an alien.   It was the opposite of fresh. You dont fry stuff then put it in a fridge, needless to say my girlfriend and I were lucky we have two bathrooms at our house.

Chipotle!!!! I love you but your empoyees are idiots. I asked them if the oil in the rice was hydrogenated and they told me YES  So after avoiding them for a good 3 months I decided to go inside and ask to see the oil.  It is Non Hydrogenated soybean oil, yes it had a few preservatives but no TRANS FATTY OILS!!!!!  The Tortilla however does have trans fat :(   But Ive been making up for old times, I think Ive had the Veggie bowl like 3 times this week!!!  Im outta control, but Ill eat good starting tomorrow ?

Ok so I was going to a movie and I really wanted a coffee.  The nearest thing was coffee plantation.  I got a cup, one sip and I was the keystone bitter beer face guy!  This coffee was like if Propel made coffee water.  This was the most watered down coffee I've ever tasted in my life.  NEVER DRINK IT!!

I used to eat here all the time till I realized they use trans fat in everything!!!!!!  They use as much if not more than fast food places!!  http://www.dietfacts.com/html/nutrition-facts/cheesecake-factory-chocolate-mousse-cheesecake-7-inch-pre-packaged-43107.htm   http://www.thedailyplate.com/nutrition-calories/food/cheesecake-factory/banana-cream-cheesecake  1,560 calories and 84g of fat for their carrot cake, and 1080 cal, 71g fat, and 100 carbs for a slice of Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake.  And those are far from being the only unhealthy items on the menu. Seemingly innocent entrees like salads and sugar free cheesecake can also be calorie-packed diet-wreckers. For example, rumor has it that The Cheesecake Factory's Chinese Chicken Salad clocks in at about 1,600 whopping calories. And the 6 Carb Original Cheesecake has 610 calories and 57g of fat.   Disgusting!!!!!!!!!!!

Baja Fresh, more like Baja garbage disposal and swept up floor stuff wrapped in a tortilla!  Baja Fresh's name is only appropriate if its opposite day.  They even put hydrogenated oils in the kids meals and the guacamole.  I wrote them an email telling them how wrong that is.   They wrote me a semi defensive/aggrasive email back saying it gives a consistensy customers want.  Nice try to make it seem like people want it.  If they were aware of what it does to your body they wouldnt care about the stupid benefit of consistency.  I hate you Baja Garbage

I am soooooo confused why this place has good reviews? Stumped actually, no.. aphauled.   Ive eaten here a few times because my mom likes this place. Why? ...Because she lives off lettuce and has never tried anything else here. She like the turkey gizzards, she has no opinion.   So I went there and got a salad, dressing was pretty gross. My brother got a burger that was actually raw, so he took it back.   So he gets the burger back and now............  The lettuce was hot wilted the bun was soggy and the cheese was still in the shape of grated cheese.   This was obviously put in the microwave, topping and all. Completely disgusting!!!!!  I had chicken there too and it was like the turkey on Nation Lampoon's Christmas Vacation!!!  If you remember that scene, that is exactly what happened here

They do a Breakfast Buffet all week 6am-11am  It used to be 17 but is now 25 a person it includes access to the buffet and oj, coffee, tazo teas.  I called ahead to see if they used partialy hydrogenated oils, THEY DONT!!  They voulenteered to call the vender they use for the bagels and called me back with the ingredients, once again it too did not have the oil.  They serve bagels, bagel spreads of lox, butter, cream cheese, very thinnly slice purple onion, capers, thin tomato slices, other stuf.  They make about 5 diffferent pasteries from scratch, different muffins, cheese danish, croisount, other stuff.  Omlets with any thing you can think of, waffles, french toast, pancakes, steel cut oatmeal, home fries, fresh berries and whipped cream, bacon , and sausage, and they will make you juevos rancheros and other egg specialties.   it is absolutley the best I go all the time

I really like this place. However it does suck time like no other place.  Somehow evertime you are there for over 2 hrs?  I usually try on 60 items to get 1 that fits well, and cry a half dozen times about being fat :(  Then I cruise the little kids clothes because the mens clothes are to large for me and the womens are cut weird.  One of my boobs is like a 3rd the size of the other so its soo hard to find clothes that dont make me look like a cancer survivor.  Anyway, good finds here. Try the clothes on even if it says the size is smaller than you wear. A lot of times it says one size but is really another. My girlfriend bought 200.00 jeans for 20.00 a piece because it said they were a 24 when they were really a 27.   P.S. anyone know where to find some dress vests?  The womens ones are too short and make me look like I have flowing love handles and the mens vests are to big in the shoulders and ribs.  I think I should try maybe a kids vest? thoughts?

I worked here when I was 20 and I couldnt fully appreciate what they have to offer.  Its unfortunate I didnt take advantage of my 30% employee discount, but I was poor since I worked there.   I really enjoy this place now, the dining room tables are the best buy ever! I was shopping fore like 5 months for a table with bench seats instead of chairs.   Then I remembered how many Cost Plus had.  I went in and they have 4 different kinds for 199.00  I dont know if you have been bench shopping lately but I find them ion the price range of 700-1200.  I liked a lot of the tables but they didnt match my style so got a table somewhere else and bought the benches here.   They also have walkers shortbread cookies on sale all the time. Ok the ingredients on that: Butter, sugar, flour, salt  Sooo Goood  But yeah great buys on tables, but they have midget couches.  They are for like a childrens playroom.

I used to come here when I wanted a free meal, because they screw up your meal everytime. They literally comp meals left and right.   I went there with friends they got an ore cart (which is a whole dried out carcass) and we got a chicken. They came out soo dry.  I mean like dry dry. Like it was beef and chicken crackers.   The waiter came over and said he would comp it and he could see how badly dry it was. Then he said free dessert.  So we naturally each ordered our own personal dessert :)  My mom went there and there was a waiter some how broke a glass on her lap. Dont ask how that happend but they tried to giver her a free Claim Jumper shirt!!!!  My mom was like Wtf! you jus ruined an expensive shirt and I have glassshards in my arms and legs.   So they gave her a free meal and a $100 gift card.  The french onion soup was all I used to get there before I was aware what was in food. I cant vouch for whats in there, but it doesnt matter anyway the food is bad.  They are really really accomodating but I think its because they are used to fucking up all the time.   If you want a free mediocre meal, come here.

I am completely and utterly confused about these reviews?!! For years I have heard about how great the food is and how people always by the salsa and chips.   I ordered a burrito of some type and cut it open and then water yep..water poured out of this burrito. I was like WTF?  I regretly tried a bite and it was dry flavorless and the little flavor it did have tasted like fish!!!   The water must have been from it being premade and frozen, Or almost rotten and frozen to save it a few extra days.  The chips were stale and thick gross had a strange flavor. The salsa was so gross it was unedible.   What is wrong with you people, did you drop acid before you ate here?

This place can eat my ass!! I went to the deli to get a sandwhich.   So I asked the clerk if they used any partially hydrogenated oils.  She had to call her corporate office.  They called her back to tell her the verdict...........................  (..........................= drumroll)  Bingo!  The harmfull oil is in there wheat bread and the white bread!!!  AMAZING!! I could never support a supposed health food store that uses an oil like that.   If you dont know how bad it is. peep this out  bantransfat.com

Well for one, I walked in to use my free trial membership. The dude started trying to tell me I was doing everything wrong.  The record stops.... Excuse me. You are fat and I used to be but lost all the weight in a very healthy way. I guess I should take advice from someone who is fat. Even though I lost all the weight on my own.  WTF? He was trying to push these crappy suplements and protein bars on me. Which btw have really bad ingredients.  Then I tried taking a group class. 2 instructors, both .. you guessed it really fat.  They didnt ever get my heart rate up because they were so out of shape they would stop before everyone else. Everyone in the class was looking around like, are you feeling this?  I used 2 of my 7 free days because other than the bad form these people were teaching they all went around telling you that you dont know what you are doing.   When in fact I trained with 2 personal trainers for over a yr one of them was in the top 20 trainers voted by Mens Magazine.   Unbelievable, plus the membership cost the same as 24 hour which they actually have to be certified to be a trainer.

Holy crap! I have never felt like a criminal like I did in Kohl's for no reason!!!  I was in there buying alot of stuff for my house, some gifts and a few clothes for me and my girlfriend. We were in there about 2 hrs we were buying a lot of kitchen stuff.   The whole time the manager was following us and standing there starring with her arms crossed.   It was soo weird and she looked like Einhorn from ace ventura.   Any way me and my girlfriend went to the dressing room to try stuff on and the manager followed us in there and then told us we could only bring in 2 at a time. Which isn't even the policy .   Then after her starring us down we checked out and she went to the register with the cashier and after the cashier would ring things up. The manager would pick it up look in the pockets, shake it, lay it down and feel every where.   I was like what are you looking for? She ignored me and smiled. I said "ookkay" then the total was 800.00  Then I chose debit and entered my pin. she grabbed the card out of my hand and was like give me your ID  That's when I got really pissed.   I told her that she isn't allowed to ask for my id when I pay debit. I told her I would love to give her my ID because she will feel like an asshole when she sees it is me.   I told her to give me her corporate number and I wrote her name down.  She was very silent the whole time and didn't even ask why. She knew she fucked up. She stormed off but not before I told her not to forget she works in Scottsdale and people spending this amount of money shouldn't be treated like criminals. Especially in Scottsdale where it is expected.   The cashier told me she does that all the time.   I called corporate and raised hell.   This was really strange and extremely extremely insulting. Plus all the stuff in Kohl's you can find at Marshals cheaper, and they carry alot of stuff at wal-mart cheaper also.

The last time I bought glasses the prescription was slightly under what I really needed. I waited forever to get new Glasses. I couldn't find any I really liked, or even liked a little. Everywhere I went it was the same glasses over and over.   I finally decided to get new glasses after 6 yrs of not even being able to wear my old ones, and driving like Mr. Magoo.   I went in there and they gave me the most thorough eye exam Ive ever had. It was crazy, I got so many tests and they spent a lot of time matching up the lenses.   They literally had the most awesome collection of glasses of anywhere. I had seen all these glasses I havent seen at every other place. They had all the same brands and then some, but they were all the other ones in the collections.   They had these really cool colored ones that were like inside out glass technique.   My girlfriend along with a narrow body also has a narrow head. Glasses never fit her, they always go passed her face on the sides. This place has ordered the narrow brands and versions that come narrow.   Unless you have a narrow head you have no idea how hard that is to find.   I am posting some pictures of my glasses. They will also replace your lenses every yr for 30.00 bucks!!

I talked to this guy and told him I live down the street and I needed somewhere to go for the night. Since it wasnt a trip they gave me a better deal. When you book here there are many different rooms. The one I got was a 1 bedroom and it had a private outdoor jacuzzi! It was like your own porch and your own backyard. It came with a free breakfast at thier restaurant wich was very good too. I only paid like 120 for the night.   Super private, super nice, and they have hamocks all over the place to chill in.

I'm not sure why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1. I think Maybe a different pizza would be better?  I got this pizza I forget the name but it had red peppers and onions and Parmesan.   I got it minus the Parmesan. It came back looking delicious.   At first bite it was good, the onions were sweet and tasty ......but then I tasted that first, there was no sauce which it didn't mention on the menu. Then the after taste was over cooked butter and bad garlic.  They smear butter in between the crust and the cheese.   Cheese and butter make an awful combo. I wish the butter and horrible garlic weren't on there. It was ruining the otherwise good pizza.  I'm mean it was so bad I couldn't eat it.   I got a salad too, the Emilia or something.  It said it had pine nuts, arugula, Red onions and red peppers.  Balsamic vinaigrette.  OK you picture it loaded with pine nuts, onions and peppers.   It gets to the table and it a whole head of lettuce and like four shavings of a pepper and a thimble of pine nuts. I maybe saw 2 things of onion.  I had the waitress bring the balsamic on the side and the lemon vinaigrette on the side.  The dressings could have been good if they didn't use whatever oil it was.  I'm like 90% sure it was soybean oil. It was a very strong flavor that was overpowering and bad, real bad. I took like 2 bites.   It was a really bad meal.   I can see the potential, and I will try a pizza with a sauce this next time.

I went there again had the Margarita pizza.   It was soggy, and tasted like a wet foot. The sauce wasn't good and the grated Parmesan tasted like cheap kraft in the green can.   They say the house make the mozzarella, that confuses me because it is super oily?  If you use quality mozzarella its not like that. You use whole milk.  So this is one of the worst pizzas ever. I'm sticking to Grimaldis, better pizza, better salad.

For a short period of time I was making a lot of money and I thought it would continue that way.  I came into the gallery and Loved Loved one of the paintings.   I brought my girlfriend in to show her and she loved it too.  We decided it was the best ainting we had ever seen.  The guy there, Im not sure if he is the owner, he told us he had seen us come in a lot and look at the painting.  He told us we could put it on lay away and make payments.  He said it was soo important to get pieces you love and it made him happy to see a couple buy there first painting together.  Well he let us only put a 100 down on this 2k painting.  Times got rough immedietly after, we had to move from our home, downgrade everything.   He let us pay him 50 here and 25 there. and I went a few months with out paying at all.  We were supposed to pay it off in 3 months. Its been over a year and Im finally almost paid off.  He is truely the most giving person ever. Since we first started paying the painting has tripled in value. But he didnt get greedy eyed, he let us keep paying what we could.  I owe him something Im thinking Ill get him a fat gift card for dinner somewhere nice.Now that things are picking up. He truley desirves it.

I do like this place they actually make the tortillas and chips there and they dont use hydrogenated oils.  They use milk in the refried beans instead of oil.  The one at North is very trippy it has glowing magenta mushrooms on the walls. Very acidy, weird.  I liked the cream cheese burrito thing but I got it not deep fried.   Pretty good a bit pricey but the portions are huge so share.  It truley is family owned my brother is friends with the owners son. I think 2 or three families own it.   It is the best mexican food I have had soo far.  But still not amazing

This place is awesome!!! I found a new hang out YAY!!!  So the happy hour is really really good. Here's What I got   Kettle of pork Carmita's with melted jack cheese and bettered flour tortillas   7.00!! = This pork literally melts in your mouth this was the most tender meat I have ever had. I wouldn't have though to order pork I'm soo glad I did. I was also surprised I wouldn't have thought of this place as having mexicanish food?  The tortillas were sooo thin and soft and buttery. Very good dish, perfect for 2.  Fish tacos 9.00 = This was very good, I have never in my life ever ever ever ordered fish tacos, since I hate fish. It was grouper   and  it came with very fresh avocado and thin sliced red onion and a very good salsa. The salsa was like blended, so it wasn't the typical tomato chunks salsa.    They also have a 7.00 "big ass burger" Yes, that's really what they call it.  I saw everyone order it and every time they brought one out I got jealous.  It was about the width off two burgers and came with a side of fries that looked soo good. They too were served in a kettle and were very thin but not the crispy gross thin ones.   We came in before they opened at like 2 and we were told that happy hour is when they open at 4pm.   This guy came in at that time and was telling us how he couldn't wait until 4 because they have the best burger ever.   So I'm excited to try more off the menu and especially try the burger

I regretably went here for my birthday last night.  Ordered the Ichi roll and got a death mayo alien roll.  This was the worst thing I have ever tasted.   1) it had at least a handful of mayo blahh  2) it had a pound of crab that looked like red/white spaghetti ( soo gross)  3) had the texture of a raw pumpkin sliced in thin strings  4) tasted like licking an old fish  We got the waitress to refund the sushi since it was un-edible.  when she brought the bill it was not itemized and we could not figure out how it came to that much. The entire time our waitress was never there, never refilled our drinks. We finally flagged her down to get a break down of the bill. she came back with the same copy!!! We asked a different person who grabbed her to help us. She came to the table and asked "do you have a problem with me?" WTF!!!  We told her  ignoring what she said " can you just bring us a breakdown of the bill"  She came back AGAIN, with an un itemized copy!!  I would not have tipped her but on parties of 6+ the add 17% gratuity  Which btw she added 20% without permission.  We were there for so long ad wanted to leave otherwise I would have disputed that tip charge in full.  You dont come up to customers and ask if they have a problem with you!!!  Not only was the food the grossest shit ever, the service can suck my ass!!

Its the only pizza place I will eat at. I actually ride my bike their with my girlfriend too!. we go to the North Scottsdale one which is actually better that the South Scottsdale one? its better with less topings, if you get onion ask for red onion specifically or they give you white and it makes a huge difference. Im normally not into thiner crusts but this is truly amazing pizza. Doesnt leave you feeling like you swallowed a brick :)  They are one of few pizza places or restaurants for thhat matter, that do not use HYDROGENATED OIL.   I will only eat at two places because of that and the cleanlyness factor.   Go to ROKA AKOR FOR SUSHI OR JAPANESE FOOD.   Its the bomb. Hands down only good food in the state!!

I forgot to mention, you have to get lighter, less heavy toppings. If you get a lot of toppings or heavy ones like sausage it will be soggy.  It will be super crispy and good if you get the light toppings.   I also discovered if you go to the website and enter your email for the newsletter(which they actually dont send you)  You get all these free pizza coupons. They send me them all the time, and its with no purchase necessary.   http://Grimaldispizzeria.com

What a waste of a cool building. In some parts it reminds me of the batman ride at magic mountain. Anyway, the food really sucks, I have gone three times, evertime ive had to return my food. Its not like preticular meals are bad, its all just bad...real bad.   Tastes like frozen dinners, like bottom of the line in quality.   Aweful.

This place is a great place to throw a small party or have a romantic night!  Certain times of the year you can secure a room for 80.00 a night.  Make sure you request the larger of the 2 models.   It has a full kitchen and utensils, fireplace, cd player, and a jacuzzi tup for 3 in the bedroom. Its a huge tub!1!  and two shower heads in the shower(obviously)  They have an arcade room and a awesome pool and spa under a waterfall.  They have poolside service and full meals.  I highly reccomend this place for a special night away!!  Since it is a resort the next week or so you will get a call from a time share. Definatly go to the presentation for the free prizes. Dont buy thought.  i go to the time share things al the time they give you lots of free stuff.  If you tell them you want to stay at the hotel the night before the presentation they usually give you the room for 30.00   Also a tip when sceduling tell them you are a local and just need to stay a night while your place is being fixed. (they will charge you less)

So I went in thinking they actually make these things from scratch. Which 99% of the time means real ingredients.  I looked at the croissants and they looked unappetizing, the decription sounded good but the didnt look flakey or anything.  Which was a sign of hydrogenated oil, for some reason it weighs croissants down and is not only worse for you than saturated fat it makes them taste like shit.   I asked the woman if there was partially hydrogenated oil in any of the food or margairine which has trans fat. She went and get the 13 yr old baker.   Who told me they dont make the icing which has partially hydrogenated oil.  WTF!! why would I just go to the grocery store if I didnt care about the oil. I could get 7 unfresh pasteries for this price? The make there shit from a mix and have premade icing.  That is literraly the dumbest thing I have heard of.  I am definetly sending them an email, because if they dont even make there food than there is actually no point.

I always have fun here.  I went here on new years this year and had a good time.  I did see the most pathetic lesbian here. She wore her make up and dressed just ike the Shane Character in the LWord.  Al I could think was, WOW what a loser. and I wish I was that skinny  Do you have no personality that you wear a costume everyday.!!  So I was with my girlfriend in line and we were holding each other. She walked away for five seconds and asked my girlfriend for her number. My girlfriend totally dissed her. I walked up and you could see the fear in her eye. She just kept saying  Sorry, Sorry, Sorry.  Well anyway aside from that I like this place.  But dont go in the bathroom unless you have to. There are always tranny's doing coke or k in the womens bathroom.  Make sure and use a tissue to lock and unlock the stall

This is the ultimate Bro bar and restaurant.  It is cramped and packed with Bro's and sluts. The food tastes like poop and usually get cramps followed by toilet time when eating here.  The food is over priced and the envoirment is horrible.  I like the look but it is way too Scottsdale (in a bad way)  Plus Id rather eat out of a garbage disposal.

I cant believe what I'm reading? People like this place?  The first time I went it was a part there for my girlfriends work. They had layed out a huge assortment of food. Each piece I ate it got worse and worse, it was weird.   For some reason I thought , well it could be because it is made in huge quantity. Almost anywhere has sucky food when catered.   We a few weeks later decided to go there since it was 20 ft from my girlfriends work and after picking her up we were too hungry to wait.    BIG MISTAKE. We got ignored for about 20 Min's, then when I asked some questions on the food or recommends. She looked at me like I told her her mom was fat. She acted soo insulted for no reason it was weird.  Aside from the bizarre waitress who didn't get our food out till our bodies ate our own stomachs(35 mins extra totaling 55 min wait)  The food finally got there and it was soo gross I actually had to send it back.I was too scared to reorder for fear it would be tampered with andI would have to wait longer and it would be just as bad. i had to argue with her for 5 mins saying I just want it off the bill, im sure its normally good but its inedible. Dont worry ill tip you as if I got it still. Jeez, real professional.   My girlfriends food was equally as bad and she was too scared to tell the waitress after my ordeal.   I told her Ill do it.   It shouldn't be this hard I told her we just cant eat any of this and told her this is for you and put a 5 on the table and left.   I should have said this is for you and spit on the table rubbed the 5 on it and left.    PS, your outfits are gay

WTF!!! Why the hell have I never been here?!! I feel soo robbed of the many disgusting Mexican food meals I have had prior to learning about this magical palace of enchantment!  I was always wondering why the hell there is no such thing as a good Mexican restaurant in AZ.  All the sauces were super good, salsa very fresh and tasty. The chicken for the only time in my entire life at a Mex joint was to my very surprise moist.... ewww gross word Whats up with watery dry chicken burritos in AZ?  I wanted to desperately eat some of the delightful sounding pork dishes but due to all the reports in the last few yrs of brain parasites being more and more frequent in the US from pork I just cant go there. I'm to fragile to handle the anxiety of, am I the rare one? Ill go nuts if I eat it, Ill think I'm dying for days later. ha ha I'm disturbed. Anyway I will be back again and again .. For non pork dishes of course.   Oh a side note, I went to their website a while back, when it worked. All the pictures were of people making food with there bare hands no gloves. I was soo shocked it was on the website even I was scared to eat here.  To my pleasant surprise, They were all wearing gloves, I checked it out .

Ok here is the thing, I went back another time and it was good.   About a month later we came late with our roomie. It was bar service only since it was late.   The bartender a middle aged over weight red haired guy went to get our chips..   I watched him walk over to the chips and grab handfuls of chips with his bare hands. HE IS THE BARTENDER HANDLEING MONEY AND HE WAS JUST HOLDING A DIRTY RAG.  I asked him for a new batch that was "hand picked" he said it was all bare hand touched.   I told him that was fine for the food preparers that dont handle fecal, infectious disease money!!  He acted like I was retard, I didnt eat anything after I saw this but we did have a few bites and the food was not good.  It wasnt aweful but it wasnt good as before, AT ALL!  Get it together over there   more like 2 and a half  P.S. If the owners read this, he needs to be schooled. I wish I knew his name, he may have had a mustache?

I am uphauled, I used to like this place until...............................................  I went there with a few people and we started to have a good conversation with our waiter, he was nice and outgoing...A little too outgoing.  He quickly shared wit us that they advertise as no MSG but they infact do use it . In all of the soups and dressings and sauces!!!!!  If they blatenly lie about that what else do they do.  Bad ethics, eith er use it and say you do which of course would lose lot of business or just take it out.   I couldnt believe this, who can I report them to if you know?

When I went there (Ive been multiple times) off the bat there is hardly anyroom. If you are in a wheel chair, you literaly wont be able to eat there. Which is fine for me but still uncomfortable. I  poured the soy sauce out, it was black and old.  When soy goes bad it turns black, taste bitter and like pure salt. They had obviously never changed out the soy in their bottles. It goes bad in a day w/o refridgeration.  For me this is a sign of poor food handling.   The fish had a very fishy flavor and a terrible texture. Actually I have got minor food poisoning there 2 times.   Go to Roka Akor if you are looking for fresh creative food. AMAZING, I will never go anywhere else.  They use no hydrogenated oils or preservatives. Freshest cleanest tasting food ever.!!!!

Ok , I here good stuff about this place and the floor is cool.   I went to eat there and ordered something with cilantro, it tasted like I was eating the entire bush of cilantro .  Everything else was gross too.   Not to mention the violent diareah ( not sure of spelling, too lazy. Well I guees in the time I took righting all of this I could have spell checked?)  At least I lost weight :)  Unless you want to become violently ill for dietary purose dont eat here.

I had the ooey gooey cupcake, very very impressed. For one the ingredients in this are all natural which is hard to find. The cake was super moist the frosting was very good. The only thing I would change is maybe add a tad less sugar and a tad more butter to the frosting. But seriously it was the 2nd best cupcake I ve ever had. (that says alot)

I personally will never eat there again.  The chips are actually amazing though, I would eat those a lot if it didnt require me stpping foot in the ultimate bro/slut restaurant.   The food is gross, the tortillas are ok, I like the decor actually, but the employees are slutty (and by slutty I saw skirts soo short if they picked something off the floor you for sure would see vagina)  Apparently the uniform is jean skirts and heels.  This is the male glittery shirt wearing capitol of Scottsdale. The food sucks, dont eat here!

I give it 2 stars and Ill tell you why. I would give it 4stars for the interior. I like what they have going on, but it does make you expect something different.  They also have a great menu selection at really good prices.   I ordered a salad that had a viagrette I really liked, other than that the salad was pretty blah. I could have made that at my house.  The chicken parmagana taste like a frozen entree from costco. The ravioli has a horrible flavor, they bring you bread and olive oil, which is fine but the olive oil is soo cheap and gross. Super bitter.  The portions a huge but who cares if the food isnt good. Its like a frozen food festival in there.   A waste of a cool building and a great menu. Just poorly executed food.

I really give it 2.5 stars. We went here my sisters b-day. I was extremely under impressed.   We got alot of stuff and it was either so so or real bad.   Calamari= the grossest shit Ive ever had. It was like the consistency of a cold stiff mozzarella cheese stick and it had that shape too. it wasn't cut into ring it was big thick sticks. The batter was like microwaved seeming because it had 100% no crisp, or flavor. I would be shocked if it wasn't prebattered and frozen. Gross  Tuna tar tar= it was just minced raw tuna but they didn't add any like flavored oil or citrus on it. It was just completely unseasoned. The fish had no flavor which is good but it was very plain.   Seared tuna= the sauce was good the noodles I likes, tuna was ok. This dish alone I would give 3.5   I would never come back here, the food was bad and just really blah. Especially for a place that specializes in fish.

I wrote an email to the director of quality control. I have pasted the conversation for you all!    Hey,I love your gelato and I eat there once a week. It is expensive, do you have any programs like a punch card or something to give loyal customers a reward once in a while or like a free b-day gelato? Most websites have a place you can sign up for news and deals. I didnt see that on your site.  I also wanted to say thanks for not using hydrogenated oil, I would reccomend and love if you considered removing it from your cones, or using a vendor that does not add it. It is becoming increasingly taboo. Plus the gelato is for the most part natural so Why stuff it in a cone that has oil banned in the entire state of California and on th ballot to be removed at tons of major citys.         Lindsay,     Thanks for contacting us regarding your concerns and praises.  Thank you very much for the kind words.  Please send me your address and I will send you some free coupons for being a loyal customer.  It's funny you brought up having a loyalty card for the gelato spot because this week I put the order in to have a electronic combo card.  It will have both features loyalty and gift card.  It will be similar to a Starbucks card but with more rewards.  It will be at least 1 month before this feature will become active since it interfaces with our Point of sale system it is a complicated process to integrate everything.  Also I did look at the ingredients for our cones and you are right about having partially hydrogenated oils in the mix being taboo these days.  I will look for another alternative to this problem quickly.  I will definitely let you know when I find new product. Unfortunately we do not make the cones from scratch like our gelato so I will have to do some research on possible making our own waffle mix.  Feel free to contact me anytime.  Thanks for hitting the gelato spot.      Thomas Plato  Director of Quality Control  The Gelato Spot  thomasp@gelatospot.com    I love you Gelato Spot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I cant believe I ever went here, but my girlfriend did the models hair that were doing a fashion show for the ugliest homemade garbage. So I came for support.   Anyway, every dude in there looks the same. Low rise seven jeans with a sparkley belt with shirt tucked behind the questionably femenine buckle, sunglasses inside, orange tan, waxed eyebrows, and shaved arms. I spoted the  lone creepy old dude that was obviously on raver drugs, in the middle of the dance floor raving out.  Bros and sluts were all freek dancing and being douchy and slutty. A ton of younger chicks with older dudes.  Its one of those places were dumb sluts starved for attention come and make out with each other in front of the ed hardy faux buff guys.   (faux buff= fat that looks like muscle under a shirt)  Whats up with all the faux buff dudes in Scottsdale. You know what Im talking about.   I dont know why they would ever charge ten dollars to come here.

The White Chocolate Brownie is the BOMB. It is pure white!! Not a chocolate brownie with whit chocolate chips, the whole thing is albino!!  I havent been there in over a yr though. I will have to call and see if they use hydrogenated oil.   If they do I wont be going back.

I went here the other day and forgot how fucking good and moist their rotisserie chicken is, seriously never had white meat that juicy!!  The honey glazed carrots are bomb the are filleted long ways, I thought it would be like baby carrot grossness but no, filleted long ways and taste like a roasted buttery marshmallow try them!!  The only thing that has trans fat is the ice cream they use dreyers, Ive written them a letter with alternative ice creams that are cheap and do not use the gross oil. Waiting to hear back.   The roasted artichoke is also super good, a little pricey at 9 bucks but good.   The service is really good, the only bad thing Ive had is steak but I hate steak when I eat out its never as good as I make it.

Is it wrong to update a review a lot?!   I went in and decided to try a new item other than my usual rotisserie chicken , which did I mention was like the most delicious thing ever?  For some reason I just wanted like a sandwich. I wouldn't think of them for a sammy(my girlfriend hates when I call them that)   I got the club BUT it isn't like other clubs. They actually rotisserie up the turkey themselves so it isn't shitty processed nitrate grossness.  it was moistest, non gamey, turkey ,the most crisp bacon,awesome cheddar and peppered tomatoes so damn good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I got it with no mustard or mayo and a side of BBQ.  The mustard I got on the side too. mayo is gross. But the BBQ I think they make, it is kinda fruity like cherries or something perfect to dip every other bite in.   The have crappy fries so dont get them as a side the mashed potatoes are very good and they added a speck of nutmeg and have a fresh thin jus from the chicken. They are really good and normally i would never order mashed potato's.  The cous cous is pretty good it has a cilantro yogurt sauce and raisins and pistachios. very pleasant ;)  I did try to get a burger once and I took it back, never get a burger. If the burger was good they would get 5 stars

I gotta say, I love coming here!! You get two movies , new movies for 6.25.  The parking is always easy and the stations are always clear.   The screens used to suck, that's why I stopped coming for yrs. If there was a dark scene, you actually couldn't see anything. For some odd reason they used to not even trim the trees that blocked part of the screen.   That's old news though.   Plus the bathroom is always clean now and you can bring dinner and not feel weird.  If you ha vent been here in a while I understand why you wouldn't like this place, seriously give it a second shot. They really made good!

You will get the best Hair cut of your life from Jamie Dix at the salon here.  She gives the most evenly blended hair cut ever!!!

She is the only one there that does updoes and African American hair.   Seriously, once you get your hair did from Jamie, you wont ever go to anyone else!!!

I went thier on a new wave night. I dont drink so its hard to find somewhere gay that I can enjoy sober. They had bitchin 80's music and had a good guy/girl ratio. Some were straight but I like that, its nice when breeders what to hang out just for the fact that they wnat to hang out and dont care if your gay/straight.  They also have a pool table wich is a rare find in gay clubs in az.  I liked it :)

So, I went here the first time like 2 and a half yrs ago. I really liked it, so I decided to go there when someone gave me a gift certificate there.  I ordered a burrito and my girlfriend ordered a grilled chicken breast.  She was eating it and was like this taste soo bad. I was like let me try!  I took one bite and the chicken tasted soo badly of fish it was soo gross.  Why would the chicken taste like fish?!?!  Well needless to say she got food poisoning and had to miss work for the next day.  Although they do have a tranny that works there and she is really nice. We always get her as our server and she gave us the "family "discount when we came.  But, I wont eat there again

Costco is well worth the membership, now they have an ever growing selection of organic stuff.  I love to buy the organic rasberries there. Its like 9 bucks for a pillow case of them. I put them in my morning oatmeal, it cools the oatmeal a litttle and thaws the berries. I also put a cup in a cup of vanilla soy milk and a splash of OJ. Blend and its a delight, with plent of vitamins and protien.  Everywere else the organic or even non organic is 5x's the amount.  They go quick so I would buy 2.  Another thing I love there is tampons, Im a lesbian so with 2 girls you can spend a lot of money in stupid cotton things with a string.  Shouldnt it be handled by insurance?  Anyway enough about weird personal shit. Check out the new organic stuff at costco :)  P.S. the gas at the one on elliott is like 20 cents cheaper than everywhere all the time

I dont know where to start about how much I hate this company.  They mess up my bill every single month. After being hung up on by 3 employees and talk to 2 managers I finally get them to realize their mistake. Then they tell me itll be correct on the next bill.  Bill comes... New problem and the refund isnt there. Start the whole process again.  I literally have spent a collective month of my life on the phone with these ass holes.  In my condo I cant get any other service due to the HOA and their bright ideas.  I pay 90 to get what dish would give me for 53  I seriously hate Cox, and not because Im a lesbian!

I have no clue what people are talking about. I hated this place, I mean its sad for the owners.. but that aside, this place was fucking gross.  Everything tasted like nasty bean water, apparently only chain smokers ate here who burnt off their taste buds. My friend raved about this place. So I came here 2 times the first time I threw it out after about 3 bites. My friend begged me to give it a second chance  I did  same thing  Im sorry but I seriously question the freshness of these ingredients.  and it was overpriced  P.S.Sorry owners..no offense

Holy Shit I remember when this was Smitty's. For some reason all the middle school kids would go here and steal cigarettes. Everyone I knew got busted here.  Kids..... huh  Any way now its Fry's. I got to say it has a nice organic section but it is more expensive than at health food stores like whole foods.   They do have really great sales on organic stuff so I always check them out  Right now the best peanut butter known to man is being clearanced there.   Its called MaraNatha and it is amazing.   The only ingredients are peanuts and salt but the do a special grinding technique that makes the peanut butter semi sweet.   I left a jar at my desk once and kept eating it, I ended up eating 3/4 of a jar. I felt like a disgusting fat fatty. I felt pukey for like the entire day.  Anyway it is usually almost 6 bucks but its marked to 3.10 Killer deal!!!  Seriously try this stuff!!  If peanut butter is non organic they keep all the nuts in these huge silo's. It gets damp in there and causes mold on the nuts. They then hose them down with antibiotics. Yuck. That's why it tastes better organic too  They are made in smaller batches to prevent moisture and cancel the need for harmful antibiotics.  People sometimes have an issue with the oils separation, but you open it and stir it real good. Put it in the fridge and now it ll be evenly blended and for the rest of the jar no separation will occur.   Was this review about Fry's or peanut butter?

Its ok food. The portions are small especially for Chinese food. I think they actually pour oil directly on the dish. Ive never had food this oily.  I do like that you can ask for extra won tons but they charge you .25 cents a won ton.   Not very good, everything tastes the same.  Im also not sure if they use any hydrogenated oils

I have to say after going to NY and having sugar sweet sunshine cupcakes I really really wanted a cupcake. I Have never liked cupcakes but after that I think about them all the time.   So I was driving by and decided to try it out. It took a pretty long time to get my 2 cupcakes for some odd reason?  Then I was kinda uphauled that they were 3.50 each  The best cupcake or even the best dessert I have had prior was amazingly 1.50. But enough of sugar sweet sunshine.  So I got the 2 cupcakes for 7 bucks, regrettably.   I figured its gotta be good right? Wrong!  Here's what I got...  Coconut= dry thick cake with no flavor, super sugary bad flavored hard frosting. Even though the grocery store brand cupcakes have trans fat they still tasted way better than these pieces of shit.  If I didn't read the ingredients Id swear it wasn't real sugar because it tasted horrible.   Black and White= even worse than the first, this one was way more dry! The icing was somewhat lemony and even harder than the first one.   I would never ever go back !!

I give them a 2 not a 1 because they actually had the best ribs ever!. They were over priced and the corn bread and various other things had trans fat in it. I confronted the president to alert them of my finding.  I told them I saw it listed in the ingredients on the corn bread.  Then questioned why have a bakery and have fresh baked bread when your using the ingredients of a sit on the shelf forever and not go bad bread?  She wrote back and told me they called the chef and they dont use it.  WTF? Its on the ingredients on the package, you idiot. She didnt even know what was in the food so she told me a lie.  Weird, they didnt even make a lot of the stuff there. Thats why she didnt know

Well to start off there was not much I could eat considering most of the food had trans fat. The ice cream they serve has mono and diglycerides (trans fat) they use grocery brand buns with High Fructose corn syrup and partially Hydrogenated oil (Also Trans Fat)   Me and Jamie ate her on NYE so maybe it is different . Jamie ate an alfredo pasta that I didn't touch (white sauces disgust me)  Later that evening she started shaking and holding her stomach.  On the drive home she said she felt like she was going to puke but I figured she was just expressing how bad she felt.   I offered to pull over and she said she couldn't wait that long. I look over and she had grabbed a Harkins cup from the floor and started puking in it then dumping it out the window to make room for more alfredo vomit. It was smelling garlicky fresh in there.  I'm sure with it being New Year it looked great throwing cups of vomit out the window, even though we don't drink.   Since we don't drink we were probably the only ones who knew this was not alcohol induced vomiting.   Oh something else I saw that night. The chef brought out some food in a cater style pan. As he was setting it down the dish rag he was holding was dragging all over the food, WTF?!

They use hydrogenated oils by the truck load, nothing more to say but I will go on.   The food is eh and the portions are huge. Is it really necessary to add a billion grms of fat in everything, especially Genetically Modified oils that are completely unneeded.   If your food is any bit fresh than get that gross trans fat out of there  Your service is soo to fyi

This is most definetly the best restaurant in all of AZ!!!  For one, they do not use any preservatives or hydrogenated oil. If you are someone that refuses to eat that garbage that is banned in multiple countries than you dont know how hard it is to find a place that wont use it in their food. Even Cheesecake factory uses it( I ban them now)  The food is very crisp and clean, so clean you can taste many different flavors in their food.  I usually give sushi places the spicy tuna test. You can tell a lot by a places tuna. Eat a piece w/o soy, if there is no fish flavor the fish is a higher cleaner quality.  The spicy tuna there is ridiculous how good it is. I also really enjoy the Crispy Prawn roll. Usually not something I would pick but the person I was with did. Boy was that a good thing. It is very good.   They have a dessert there with flowers and rasberry. I dont remember what its called but it is immaculate.  Starters  butter-fish tataki and calamari Soo damn good.    MOST PLACES LOOK LIKE REALLY NICE RESTAURANTS, LIKE  SAPPORO, BLUE WASABI, AND RA.... BUTT ALL THOSE RESTAURANTS FOOD TASTE LIKE CRAP!  UNLESS YOU HAVE HAD SOME QUALITY SUSHI YOU PROBABLY WILL THINK THOSE PLACES ARE GOOD.  TAKE THE TEST GO TO ROKA AND YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO EAT THAT GARBAGE DISPOSAL FOOD AGAIN!!  NOT TO MENTION THAT FOR ONCE YOU WONT HAVE THE SHITS!!  ITS ON INDIAN BEND AND SCOTTSDALE   P.S. THE DUCK IS OFF THE CHAIN!

I had the duck again and it was very gamey. I couldnt eat more than a bite.  The black cod was very good, but for some odd reason the first bite was really bad. I almost didnt take another bite.   The calimari is super super good, it was squishy and not like any other ive ever had.   Vegetable tempura was pretty dissappointing.  The butterfish is something I could eat for eternity! It is super amazing.  The miso was bad.  All of the starters are amazing

I havent been to Roka in a while so I decided to pop in and check it out.   I wasnt starving so I just wanted a few things.   I got an order of the calamari which is soo good there. I actually wont eat it anywhere else. It has thin sliced serrano peppers and lime juice.   We were greeted after by William the manager I believe. I love that guy, he is soo good at his job. He is the english guy that will come around with the boy like smail asking how everything is. If it would be soo weird I would hug him when I see him. He is soo cute.  Anyway he wanted us to try this new dish out which was a perfect gem of a starter. It had the most perfectly seasoned sweet and salty tuna tataki with chared tomatos and mushrooms and asparagas.   Let me tell you, I hate mushrooms, even the name makes me sick.  I havent eaten a mushroom in a yr at least, every once in a while Ill give it a shot then realize how much I hate them.  Anyway I said what the hell and took a bite of one. WTF, this is the first mushroom I have ever liked, it was perfectly smoky and nutty, you know I watch food network all the time and I hear them say mushrooms have a nutty flavor. All I have ever tasted is dirt, but know I actually know what they mean. This new tuna starter will be on the menu after the 1st he told us, and he surprisingly comped us!!!!!   We had already planned to try the happy hour menu since we hadnt been there since they made one. So when he took care of the bill I felt a little awekward going to the bar to get more stuff. I hope he didnt think we were trying to freeload, hahaha.  We paid over there anyway.   I will for sure not wait soo long to go back   oh and I had a non alcoholic  apple mojito, it was awesome and not overly sweet.  My only complaint is that they dont have wrapped straws.  Most people dont care, but I actually caught a staph infection on my face from a server who I guess was touching there staph wound and then stuck my straw in the drink with hands were my mouth goes.   I will never ever leave home with out a sealed straw.

This mall blows dogs for quarters (if you know what thats from you get my respect)  It is the Paradise Valley Mall, it should be nice!  I drove by the other day and saw they are redoing it, they totally need to. I want it to be good but it has crap stores

It was a struggle for me to choose between 2 stars or 3.Its more of a 2.5 but do I want to give them the extra edge?  NO  Anyway I got a regular cheese pizza and for 10 bucks it ended up being   1)Sour Dough crust WTF, who doesn't metion the crust taste like the most sour sourdough ever?  2) it actually tasted similar to Peter Piper Pizza  3).........................(dots equal drum roll) It was the size of large burger. Seriously it was about equal to 2  and a half normal slices.   This pizza tasted like shit and for 10 dollars I can go to grimaldis and get an awesome pizza triple the size and quadruple the quality.   P.S. The waiters uniform makes them look like tools. Like they work in a country club. You know what I'm talking about if you been there.

I was really looking forward to eating here. I went online and salivated over the menu. I got there and this is what I ordered.  Spicy Tuna-Super fishy and the rice was oily. The sea weed was tough too  Beef Skewers- It was very Tender but not very good flavor. Certainly not worth the price  Rangoon- This was actually really good but the sauce was terrible and Im sure from a frozen package. I would bet money they dont make the sauces or the rangoon in store.   Save your money, this place is the worst sushi I think Ive ever eaten. The tuna was so fishy it actually scared me.

Chipotle!!!! I love you but your empoyees are idiots. I asked them if the oil in the rice was hydrogenated and they told me YES  So after avoiding them for a good 3 months I decided to go inside and ask to see the oil.  It is Non Hydrogenated soybean oil, yes it had a few preservatives but no TRANS FATTY OILS!!!!!  The Tortilla however does have trans fat :(   But Ive been making up for old times, I think Ive had the Veggie bowl like 3 times this week!!!  Im outta control, but Ill eat good starting tomorrow ?

holy hell, why have I not eaten here before. Bomb ass food!  Ok, so I had the thai ribs and the market street tacos. I got really ghetto and just ate in the car.   Thai ribs fell apart just from touching it with my plastic fork. It was a nice asianish flavor with a background taste of orange, which I normally hate but it was very good. Came with a slaw which I was put off by since I hate mayo. But to my suprise ....no mayo!!!! It was like a sweet vinagrette with cashews and cranberries. Very nice.  The market street tacos had some steak, cheese grilled onions and avacado. This was also very good. It would have been about 100 times better minus the corn tortilla. The steak was super tender.   I am now obsessed with going back for breakfast!

****this review is based on breakfast menu only**************   Since I love the lunch and dinner soo much I thought I would go for Sunday brunch.   First off they had a horrible selection of breakfast, they dont even serve french toast or omelets or breakfast sandwiches.   They had a egg breakfast, which is what I got. Consisted of 2 eggs with cheese and bacon and tomato and avocado slices on the side.  First off I give it 1 star for appearance. It looked worse that what I could have made at home.  The bacon was soggy the eggs were looking like neon yellow and clearly a boxed egg. (which should not be the case with a place like herb box for 9 buck for box eggs and soggy bacon)  I could have made it way better at home   Jamie got the buckwheat pancakes since they didn't have an option to have buttermilk. The pancakes were super super dry and almost gritty. It said it came with strawberries... I'm not kidding you it was a half strawberry cut in 3 small pieces. It also had dried blueberries which were actually soo gross I could not believe they would not use the fresh ones.   Aside from that the only other thing on the menu was   custard donut and hot cocoa for 9 bucks wtf? a 9 dollar donut.   a bowl of oatmeal for 6 bucks   breakfast burrito which the guy next to us got and he took it back. He said it was litterally egg and dry black beans unseasoned  I saw the size and it was like 2 breakfast taquitos.  There where like 2 more things but I cant think of it  If you want the breakfast herbox should have go to arcadia farms.

Subway is a royal piece of shit!!   They pretent to be healthy but they use trans fat in all of their food.   Butter and natural vegetable oil is metabolizable.   I cant believe they wont do the right thing and take it out of thier food.   It is banned in many countries and in multiple states here.   F you Subway!

By far the best Ice Cream and desserts ever!!!! I live next door. Blessing, or Curse?   Any way the waffle cones are off the chain, and everything is made there. The caramel, the brownies, the cones, everything is made there.   Very admirable, Rock on!!!  Seriously try the carmel ice cream, soo good!!

This may be my new favorite!! Everything is trans fat free 100%. The wait was pretty crazy but it was worth it.   The whole feel of the place is really cool. I always want to eat healthy but not cook, never can I get both.   Lots of places claim to be healthy but after several probing questions I usually find a few things that are tainted with trans fat and high fructose corn syrup.   Not here though!!!   Being a lesbian I have a lot of vegan/vegetarian friends. (I guess lesbians really don't like meat) They always want to go out but I find that most vegan/vegetarian places have less than good food. They almost always seem like the kitchen would be all dirty.   I cant wait to take my non meat eating friends here.   Here's what I got   The butternut squash ravioli = awesome! The dough is made I think like gluten free or something, which isn't a selling point for me but it was very good. Usually the gluten free noodles are sick, I actually really liked the texture and taste. Its in a yogurt honey sauce, to me sounded a little gross.  My gf ordered it but it was delicious, it was the perfect sweetness. It was served hot which I thought it may be cold I guess because of the yogurt factor.   I ordered the root veggies. I did really like it but I thought they flavor could have been a little more herby. It wasn't bland but I think the flavor for sure could have been kicked up a notch. The Farro that came with it, was super good. I wish there was more of it especially for 15 bucks.   The bathroom was weird, it was really small. The door was thin sheet metal and so was he lock. When you lock the stall it makes the most awefal screechy metal nose.  The soap was actually a natural soap which was nice but not antibacterial.  Ok, they habd the coolest hand dryer, I mean this thing is bad ass. You put your hands in it like a car wash dryer. I dont know how to describe it but make sure you check that bitch out :)

No competion for this place!! I freaking love the yogurt here. It is icey which I love love love. Its actually really tangy but not in a sick way.   Its set up like a salad bar, as in you add all your own toppings and yogurt and pay by weight. Which you would figure would be expensive.. not the case.  The most genius thing is... they have the outside of those delightful Mochi Ball things as a topping. doughy goodness...AWESOOOOMMMEE (meant as singing)  all the berry flavors are good.   only complaint is, it is tough to taste the flavors before you put them in your self serve bowl.

DUUUUDEEE, how excited am I for this place to open less than a mile from my work????? They have a 5 dollar lunch special every day from 11-3. Oh did I mention its bomb!!  Yesterday it was angus burger w sweet potato fries and a gelato.. $$5.00 bucks !!!  Today I got the small soup(not small at all) and a 6 inch fresh bagette (didnt cut the roof of my mouth) with avacado bacon and turkey. The bread tasted seriously like it just came from the oven . Oh and it was $$5   On mondays they do a 1/2off organic milkshake, which is super good.   Best freaking deal, for real food, well just food in general. And its damn good  5 stars because they use real ingredients and awesome specials.

Ive been here about 3 times since my last review (I'm fat) and they are very consistent. I had the $5 dollar meal of the day which was Tuesdays  Burger (grill flavor and I actually got it cooked the way I asked )  Sweet potato fries (sub a dollar and well worth it)  Scoop of blood orange gelato (delish)   Yes all for 5 dollars well 6 because I got sweet potato fries instead of regular fries.    Yesterday I got one of those magical turkey bacon avocado sammies and when I tried to pay I got declined. WTF I thought, it turned out some other company took money out unauthorized.. that's another story though.   The clerk said I could pay him tomorrow and didn't make a thing about it, what??? who does that? Awesome Customer service, I of course paid today and got a taste of what my burgers should taste like :)   If you came here and didn't like it, try it again it must have been an off day. I come here almost everyday and send all my coworkers here and no one has had a complaint.   The website has a list of what 5dollar meal is on which day.   Tomorrow its soup sandwich and cookie day yay!!!

WOW!!!   I know I know Ive already reviewed this place. But today I tried the spicy tuna.. holy hell.   I was super skeptical and dont like buying sushi from places like that but I said fuck it.   I am Glad I did. I got a spicy tuna for 5.85 or was it 5.95 anyway under 6 and it was huge like double sushi.   THIS WAS HANDS DOWN NO CONTEST BEST SPICY TUNA IVE EVER HAD IN AZ AND LA.   The rice was soft the fish had absolutely no odd fishy flavor. had great flavor real wasabi ultra fresh ginger.   Why is this place so slow at lunch, I'm like living here!!!   Its soo good I almost feel bad Im paying soo little for this.   IM NOT KIDDING TRY THE SPICY TUNA!!

Ok let me start off by saying I have eaten at the clarendon kitchen before it was thankfully demolished. My gf got such bad food poisoning she was barfing in a Harkins Loyelty cup on the freeway, because she couldnt make it to pull over. After emtying it several times out the window to refill it, she had a cold sweat for the rest of the night.  I think she lost like 4 lbs and she is super tiny to begin with so by the next day she was skeletor... So naturally I was jealous, not really, but kinda.. no I kid, but seriously...   So enough background on the horror this spot was.   At first we were leary but when we arrived it was completely open and gutted, you could see the kitchen which for a germy like me that is a beautiful thing.   The menu is small and slightly hard to read at first.   We ordered the guacamole before I realized it was 7 bucks. When we got it it looked like the chunks would be too big for my gf liking (because I micro manage how she eats) after one bite this shit was definatly the best guac Ive had, for real. I heard about the mandarines which I actually hate, so I was a skeptic.. no it was delicious.   I got beef tacos which were melt in your mouth.  the veggie was pretty good but had mushrooms, I fucking hate mushrooms. Those sick ass little horse pissed on poop bi products.  Aside from the mushrooms it was very tasty, i would get them again minus the poopy shrooms.   Oh the best part is they serve the coke in a can and its a buck... finally someone gets that its a joke to charge 2.50 for a fucking soda.  Awesome job, Ill be coming back to try some breakfast or hang out and try that beer you doctor up.   If you ever ate at clarendon kitchen , dont be scared its nothing like that nightmare !!!!

I went there on a Mon around 9:30 am. It was a ghost town and we got seated very quick.  I have to say they have the most comfortable seats!  I didnt sit in the chair but a like bench couch thing? Super soft.  The whole decor and music vibe was really cool, I really dugg it.  My girlfriend got  french toast (because she is a bitch and has to be super toned and fit with out working out or eating good) which came with chicken apple sausage. Ok, heres the thing about that, I hate sausage(insert lesbian joke here) but it didnt have the typical sausagy flavors. It was really  really good. It was tangy salty and sweet.  The french toast was extremely good. I think it may have been dipped in blueberry before cooked?  The waitress was super accomodating, and nice.   Oh and they do have french press coffee which I was disappointed by , but after I had it.. holly crap best coffee ever!!!! it was smooth had good flavors, no bitterness at all.   The only use butter and vegetable oil which is soo nice to see they dont load you up with horrible for you margerine.   My only complaint is, I ordered a sandwich and got a totally different one. When I told them she went to the cooks and found out they didnt have that bread and randomly added egg?   She took it back and it was no big deal but she informed me it was only a month old and were still learning the menu.   Kinda weird but nothing big, my new favorite breakfast place.

I am way sad I cant get your service at my condo.  My condo does not face south enough :( they could put it on the roof but the HOA will not allow it (dicks)   I called and got a guy that was super help full. My credit wasn't good enough for me to lease the equipment. I would need to buy it upfront. It would be 2 receivers for 199.00 total. Seems steep, but when you compare to Cox who actually charges 40. 00 more a month for the same thing at dish, its a good deal.  You get all 200 channels plus 11 showtime channels. After 2 months on time payments I can lease a dvr for 7 bucks more a month.  If I set it up for direct payment I get free HBO and cinnamax for a yr.  I get 3 months free and since I bought the equipment there is no contract!!  They will also move you for free once a yr. Direct did not offer that.   All of this for 53.00 a month.   I am soo pissed, to avoid using Cox service again I tried to sign up for choice. Couldnt do that either, and they screwed all this stuff up.   In the end Im getting fucked by cox again :( (pun intended)
