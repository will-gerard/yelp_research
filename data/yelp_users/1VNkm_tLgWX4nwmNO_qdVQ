Parking! Parking! Parking! What a nightmare! I have never found a spot inside their parking area. I always park at the Wendys across the street and walk over. As for the service I can't complain, they have always helped me out and been very nice. It does however take me awhile to get an appointment. Usually ranges between 7-10 business days. I have also never had anyone at my clinic ever pick up the phone. I have always left a message and they return it within 24-48 hours.

I travel from Tolleson here and there is a dentist right across the street from my house. That's how much I love this place. I have really bad teeth and always need something when I go to the dentist. I have had 3 crowns done here and every time it's a breeze. They make it super comfortable and even have TVs on the ceiling for you to watch. The best part is they have a CEREC machine which creates a permanent crown for you right on the spot. No wearing a temporary and waiting two weeks. Only a few places in the valley have this.  My dentist is Dr. DeMark and he is the best dentist I've ever been too. He makes my appointments painless and easy. He even calls you that night to make sure everything is ok.   The office is super clean and the staff is super friendly. As long as I live in the Phoenix area I will always come here.

I come here for lunch a lot and it's always been good. I always get the same thing, the club lite and it's amazing. The fruit is always good and I'm such a huge fan of the ginger bead mini muffins. If you take the time to do the survey on your receipt, you can get a free cookie on the next visit. The prices are ok, the service is great and the food is probably the healthiest I eat.

I love this store, the holiday candles are the best. The staff is always friendly and never mind while I sniff all the candles they own.  My 3 candle recommendations for you:  October thru Thanksgiving - Spiced Pumpkin Thanksgiving thru Christmas - Sparkling Cinnamon Anytime else - Lavender Vanilla (ladies love it)  Tip:  Ask the employees to teach you wick trimming.

It's McDonalds, everyone has probably been to one at least once in their life. I've never had problems with this one. They have the double drive thru like most do now a days which makes things go faster. They do charge you sometimes for extra sauce which sucks, but it days right on their window "additional charges for sauces and condiments." So you really can't get to upset.  The fries are always good and the new wraps are alright I'd recommend the chicken & bacon one.

I came here with a group of friends and really had a good time. It's a very older crowd, I would say the average age was above 40. The band did a good job and I had a lot of fun dancing. There was a $5 cover, which is typical for most places. The dance floor was kinda small and kept getting crowded, but it was good enough. The fire pit outside was great and a nice treat on a cool November evening. The drinks were about 5.50 a beer and food seemed reasonable priced. I didn't have anything to eat, but I'll have to comeback and try it.

I came here for pool on a Friday night. The pool tables are good and the service and beer was good. After pool we migrated over to the bar area for karaoke. The karaoke was a blast and I had a great time. I will definitely come back for karaoke again.

This Taco Bell is terrible. The food is the same as any other Taco Bell, but the service here is downright sad. They have messed up my order 3 times in a row. I hate sour cream and always ask for no sour cream and every time I always get sour cream. This place sucks at life, go somewhere else.

I got recruited out of this mall for the Army back in 2005. They have since moved the recruiter station down the street, because it was "unsafe" to be in this mall. That should tell you something about coming here.

First off it does not stand out in anyway. I was looking for a big brewery and it's just a small spot in a plaza. The decor is an old library mixed with a rundown dive bar. I sat down and looked over the beer list, 25-30 beers on tap which is cool.  My friends rave about the pizza here so I was going to order the T-Rex, but my waitress passed by me 7 times and didn't care to take my order. After that I lost interest and didn't want to eat here anymore and finally flagged her down, paid for my beer and left.  As for the Orange Blossom, if you ever wondered what a creme soda would taste like in beer form this is it. Not a fan.

Great beer! great food! great service! Their beer is amazing. I'm a huge fan of the Arizona Peach and Pumpkin Porter. I usually order the same thing every-time I'm there: four peaks cheeseburger or the 8th st ale chicken tenders. They have never let me down so far.  The only thing wrong with this place is the parking. It is a total nightmare. With a place this popular you think they would have a huge parking lot. Nope, just a few spaces here and there and a dirt alley.  Maybe someday they will expand to the west valley. That would be great!

If you like eating next to stray cats and tons of birds then this is your place!  Food, service, parking and decor are horrible. The inside looks like a haunted house and the outside is a complete wreck. I literally had stray cats walking right past me while I was sitting outside. There were also tons of birds swooping down to get bits of food right next to me. Wow...just wow I couldn't believe it, I've never seen that before. I quickly paid my tab and got out of there. I cannot ever recommend this place. They should give Jon Taffer a call, because this place needs help.

My friend owns a speed boat, so we came out here on a Saturday. I believe price to enter was $8. It was a breeze unloading the boat and they even had a shuttle service to get you from the parking lot to the dock.  The lake itself was amazing, alot of room for boating and just dropping anchor. They even hand you a map at the entrance so you don't get lost while boating around. It also tells you were "party cove" is so you can go tie up with people and hangout.  If you look around you can find spots to drop anchor and do a little cliff diving.  I had a blast here and will be coming back. My advise to anyone going, wear alot of sunscreen and keep reapplying it.

My cousin was going cupcake tasting to find cupcakes for her baby shower. So I thought why not I'll go. We came here and wow! I'm not a big cupcake fan, but their coconut cupcake blew me away. We tried a lot of the others, but i kept coming back to the coconut. It's super delicious and I recommend it, if you like coconut.  I will definitely have to come back and try some cookies, muffins and bread. A tip from me would be to add coffee to your drink list. I was craving a cup while I was there.

Sometimes you have to go to Walmart, because they have everything and man do I hate coming here. This has to be the worst Walmart I've been too. It's always packed and always dirty. I've gone on 3 different occasions and they were out of carts wtf! Also they have a very dim lit parking lot and there are shady characters hanging out there at night near the gardening section. Does this place have security or loss prevention, because I've never seen them. Avoid this place if possible.  Pros: It's Walmart it has everything  Cons: Dirty, crowded, no security, dark parking lots, shady characters hanging out, no carts.

This is a great theater and the Cine Capri is really great. The service is friendly and the popcorn is good. If your a loyal Harkins movie goer you gotta get the souvenir cup and shirt. It's just a great bargain.  The only problem with this theater is it's extremely popular and the movies sell out fast, even with the Cine Capri. Just plan ahead and show up early and you'll be fine.

This theater is my theater of choice. I always try to come to this one over the gateway 18. It's quiet and the crowd is older so usually there's no texting during the movie. The location is great, they have nice places to eat and shop around. Like all Harkins it has:  1. Loyalty Cups ($1 refills) 2. Loyalty T-shirts (Free popcorn) 3. Military Discount  If you live within the area, I would highly recommend this theater over gateway 18 and arrowhead 18.

I'm not a fan of AMC at all. I always try to stick with Harkins, but I was forced to come here with friends on a Saturday night. If your a person who tries to buy locally, go to Harkins. Harkins is a local theater with their HQ in Scottsdale. AMC(American Multi-Cinema) is a subsidiary of a Chinese company. All that aside here is what I think.  Pros:  -Nice lobby/Interior -Nice surrounding area  Cons: -No military discount -No souvenir shirts or cups -Prices are terrible -Parking is a nightmare -Teenager hangout -Loud teenagers texting/talking in theater.

I like the surfer, ocean, tiki vibe that's here. The TVs are always playing a surfing channel. It makes the atmosphere really sparkle and helps with the Phoenix heat. The food here is good nothing really special about it. They do however have a pretty good lunch special menu. It's also one of the few places in the valley that I've seen Longboard on tap.  I'm a fan and do like coming here once in awhile to get a beer and burger.

Cool spot, nice decor, clean and good food. The service was good, things did take awhile to get, but it was not a big deal. The thing that is lacking is the selection of beer. They had 3: Miller Light, Kilt Lifter and Sapporo (Japanese Beer). I guess I can't really complain about the beer since it's a Japanese restaurant, but it still was disappointing. Overall it was a good time, I can see this place being a big date spot.

I'm a huge fan of this place. The service is fantastic and the food is great. I really like the duck plate and veal pasta plate. The restaurant gives you a free ticket to the gondola ride at the hotel, which makes the perfect date night. It is very expensive by my standards and I only come here once in a blue moon, but it's totally worth it.

This place has great food, great service and is in a great location. The lunch specials are a good deal, but if your eating and drinking here for dinner your tab will be pretty high. Just make sure you check the beer and wine prices before ordering or you could be sitting there staring at your bill going "wtf."

I'm a huge Target fan and Wow! This store is amazing. It's basically the Target version of Wal-Mart except more awesome and better. It's clean, big and the staff is always friendly. The grocery section is fantastic and always has everything I'm looking for.  If your a regular Target customer be sure to sign up for the RedCard (5% discount) and download the Cartwheel app for your phone. The app has a lot of discounts and they scan the bar-code right off your phone. Target also has coupons on it's website and they allow 1 Target coupon and 1 manufacturer coupon to be used on the same item.

I really use to love this place. I like to go dancing and ever since they took away the bar around the dance floor, there is no place to put your drink, lean and the dance floor is virtually nonexistent when it gets crowded. The last 3 times I've been there they served me beer in a 32oz cup not a mason jar wtf? Still this place is good to come see concerts Hopefully the one opening up in Peoria will be better.

I have given this place 2 tries and they are just terrible. The sauce here taste funny and the overall pizza was not good. The worst thing about this place is the wait times. The last time I order over the phone app and it said my pizza was ready for pickup at 6:10pm. I got there right on time and watched them hand my order to the person in front of me. They then had to remake my order which made me wait there for 20 minutes.

This store is never really too crowded and there's always plenty of parking. Every time I go there is always someone to help and the selection is always great. Even though the store isn't too busy, they do seem to only have one cashier working and so there is usually a line of 2-3 people.

First off this place in in the Banner Health Hospital, which is a very nice clean place. The staff here was extremely friendly and helpful. My problem was the wait time. I had an appointment at 12:30pm, which I showed up 10 minutes early for. I did not get seen until 1pm. This place was packed, I believe the wait time for people with no appointment was an hour and thirty minutes.  Do yourself a favor, go online and set up an appointment.

Their prices don't match online prices and they never carry the shoes advertised on sale online in the store. They also do not notify you if the shoes you ordered online were not sent. I waited 2 weeks for a pair and finally went to the store to complain. The employee told me there was nothing he could do and that I had to call the customer hotline...wow really? Makes no sense to me isn't that part of your job? Anyways turns out they were out of stock and were in the process of refunding my money, but no email was sent.   I have to give this place 1 star. My experience was just terrible.

Caught happy hour here on Sunday. The service was ok and the decor is great. Very nice looking place. The portions of the food are terrible. Even for happy hour they are very small. I had a Margarita and it was really strong, a plus for alot of people, but a negative for me. Overall I probably won't ever come back. Just not for me, better places to go to.

The happy hour is a pretty good deal. The selection of beer on draft is slim, very slim.  The service has always been good for me. The food is hit or miss, usually only try the happy hour menu, I can't really recommend anything. They always have games and music videos playing which I really dig. Overall I really like coming here for happy hour.

I've been here twice. Once for the Larry Fitzgerald celebrity softball game and the other for the recent Tim McGraw concert. The place overall is nice and they always have a lot of security and emergency personnel walking around which I like. In the summer it can get very hot, but if you've lived in the Phoenix area long enough you would know that. I'd definitely come back for future events.

Not a fan of this place. The food is terrible and pricey, The staff is pretty terrible and ticket times run slow even though there seems to be a lot of them there. The dance floor is nice, but I don't like how they play hip hop or as they call it "Top 40."  With a name like Cactus Moon you think it would be straight country. The one great thing about this place is the pool table, they are great.

Huge beer selection which is great. The service is good and the place itself has a nice decor and plenty of TVs. The food is good I usually get the Newcastle cheeseburger. The prices are a little high, but you can tell that from the outside of the building walking in. This place could very well be a high class Hooters: It has all women waitresses and they dress in little tight dresses.

Out of all the theaters in Arizona, this takes the cake!  -Nice lobby with a bar -Movie posters that play trailers -Groupon deals: $6 for a movie and a free soda -Big leather seats -Food & drinks through out the movie -Good service -Good food: my favorite is the coconut chicken tenders -No cellphone use rules are enforced (love that)  If I lived in Scottsdale I would always come here. Maybe they will expand around the valley someday.

I enjoy coming here. My service has always been good, but I always sit at the bar & not a section. People seem to forget this is Hooters, it's wings & women...I really don't see why people are expecting a 5 star dining experience. I can't understand the concept of bringing a family or small children to Hooters, it blows my mind.  Tips for you: -Wednesday are specials. all you can eat wings & $6.99 10 wings & fries. So this day will be busy. -Sit at the bar, service seems to be better & faster if your drinking. -If you like Latino women, this Hooters is for you.  Observations: -Average guy age 40, average Hooters girl age 21. -90% Latino crowd -Old guys hitting on young women (pretty entertaining to watch)

I came in here today for national donut day. You buy a drink and get a free donut. Wow great service! They give 10% police discount. I'm not a police officer, but the guy still gave it to me for being military. I didn't even ask for it, he recognized my USAA card. Freaking awesome!   Just FYI, for the summer they have $.99 medium ice coffees. Sweet!

I usually go to four peaks tasting room every Sunday and check out different food trucks. This has to be my favorite of the bunch so far. The dishes are extremely good, huge portions and well priced. When they are at the tasting room they take some of the 8th street ale and make a bratwurst & fry bread combo which is really good. The cinnamon, sugar and honey fry bread is amazing and a great way to top off a meal.

Not a fan, why they chose to put it right next to westgate is beyond me. The parking here is terrible. When there's a game or event going on in westgate don't even bother. No food court which is strange. It's all outdoors with no covered parking. During the summer this place is going to be a nightmare. They do have pretty good stores so they get 2 stars.

I'm a fan of Four Peaks, like always the beer is great. This place is a good place to grab a beer. It's kinda in the middle of nowhere but I dig it. They change up the food trucks daily and it's nice to try the different trucks. The parking is great, but I guess they don't really need it. Every time I've been there it seems pretty dead.

I recently came here for the Jason Aldean Night Train Tour. I've been to a lot of concerts in the Phoenix area and around Texas. This by far the worst sounding venue I have ever been too. I don't care who is playing here, I will never come back.  A few other side notes: -Low security inside the venue (I saw more security at fear farm then this place) -Didn't see any paramedics on-site -Overpriced drinks

This bar was extremely dirty on the outside, they could use a power wash. The place looks like it's out of business and their water fountain has no water in it. The inside was under construction while I was there. I wanted to walk out as soon as I stepped in, but I wanted to try the moonshine. I had a beer and some apple pie moonshine, which was ok, nothing special. Judging by the outside and inside I didn't want to eat here. I can't see how this would be a place to go dancing, it's really small compared to other country bars.

"No cover charge..." Seems nobody at Toby Keith's has ever heard his song. Oh well I understand they need to make a profit, but be warned there is a $5 cover for guys. Show your military i.d. for free cover.  So lets review. The food and service gets 2 stars, but then again I don't come here to eat. I come here to dance. The dance floor is great and is never too crowded. I must say the crowd here is a complete 180 from the one in Mesa. I kept seeing guys with baggy pants and stickers on their hats and women with tight short dresses with hooker heels. It's a country bar...not a hip hop club. I guess that's why the dance floor is not crowded, because not to many people their can country dance. The drink prices are pretty insane, I think it was $9 for a tall blue moon eek!  I would take this one over the Mesa one any day. The layout is better, the dance floor is nice and I could actually find a seat. So at the end of the day I'm a fan and it's a good place to come dance.
