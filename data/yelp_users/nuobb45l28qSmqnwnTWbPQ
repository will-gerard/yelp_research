What a relaxing place to have coffee or hot chocolate. The coffee tastes great, and Ted & Maria make an awesome latte. The garden at Harper's Nursery is always beautiful, and it's like a little nature getaway in the middle of the city. Highly recommend it!

I love this dental office.  The staff is efficient, the technology and dental techniques are state of the art, and all of the procedures are explained prior to beginning treatment.  I have had a root canal, crowns, gum grafts, cleanings, and fillings replaced, all with precision and proper pain management. I believe my oral hygiene is the best it's ever been...and I'm pretty particular about my teeth.

I am beyond pissed. We reserved a cab for a 6:00 a.m. ride to Sky Harbor for an international flight. After calling and being on hold for 10 minutes when the cab was late, I was told there was no order for a cab. After some heated words from me, I was told there was a reservation but no pickup time was entered. "Sorry, there's really nothing we can do" was the agent's statement to me. My response..."We will never use your company again."
