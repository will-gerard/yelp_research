After having issues in the past at this location I decided to give it another try as I was visiting for the holidays. I pulled in, was greeted and they filled my tank up. I asked for "the works" wash and my ticket was written up. I knew the approximate price of the gas I needed and the price of the wash so I didn't think twice when I was rung up inside. After I paid I looked at my receipt and I had a surcharge for a large vehicle. I drive a  small vw sedan. I couldn't believe they tried to sneak the surcharge past me. I walked in and requested they refund me. They gal at the check-out said my ticket had been written with a surcharge.. Yeah the guy who filled the gas tank of my small sedan thought I wouldn't notice a surcharge. I won't be going back here, I will take my absurdly large Jetta to one of the many other car washes in Scottsdale.

I haven't been to PB Scottsdale in about 9 months, however before that I went for about a year on and off. The reason for the review, I didn't realize how awful my experience was at PB Scottsdale until I went to 2 other Barre studios, one also being a Pure Barre. PB Scottsdale has a large following, however if you're not one of the regulars, you're made to feel like an outsider, by teachers and classmates alike: think high school/mean girls. After comparing my experiences, PB Scottsdale seems to take class so seriously, not uplifting and fun. Yeah, the music is upbeat and fun, but again if you're new or needing modifications I didn't find the tips and tricks given without asking. Needless to say, I'm glad I found studios that are uplifting and that care about me and my personal experience.

LOVE DRY BAR! Seriously that is all I can say. Its the perfect place to come for an afternoon to yourself, a girls day, or an evening event. I can't get over how amazing the products smell.. I leave each time with more and more. I have the monthly membership, which is totally worth it if you are in there often, the 'credits' even work at their other locations (Phoenix, LA, etc). I have always walked away with a quality blow out. I trust them so much, I used them for my bridal party's hair last October!

We discovered Barrio Queen a few years ago and have loved it ever since. Barrio Queen always has rotating happy hour specials on tacos and a great Taco Tuesday. Most of the time we sit at the bar, with great bartenders, delicious drinks, and close proximity to the kitchen its always a great experience.   Highly recommend the tacos (3 for $10), street corn, and table side guacamole. If my stomach was bigger I would have every taco on the menu, but my favorites are: Carne, Chorizo, and Azul, Cochinita Pibil, and Suadero Azteca.
