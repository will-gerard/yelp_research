I purchased a new pair of snowboard boots from Ski Pro during the ski swap in Flagstaff this past September/October 2015. The boots were sold as new, on clearance.  I was really there to buy stuff for my young kiddos, so in the interest of time I only tried on the left boot. Big mistake. I went to go use the boots for the first time today and the boa in the right boot was broken. Not only was it broken, but part of the liner from the boot itself was missing.  I called Ski Pro and they refused to refund or even issue store credit...

Original Issue: A boot sold as new was missing a part from the liner and was broken; less than stellar phone support by nice employee who lacked some withitness.  Highlight: in store experience.  My wife was in PHX today for work, stopped by the Camelback store.  The gents working the snowboard area were most helpful.  I also received a response to my Yelp review from Ski Pro. Both provided more options than what were conveyed when I called the day before.  Ski Pro showed they actually cared about my experience.  Resolution: store credit, my preferred option given the circumstance.  This was a weird situation. I appreciate Ski Pro standing behind the sale and their merchandise... way better than where I thought I was going to be yesterday.  Thanks Ski Pro.
