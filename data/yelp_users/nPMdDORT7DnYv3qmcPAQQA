Nice food, decent service.  Good prices for the most part, except for the kids meals, that are a bit too much for the little that they eat.  I now only go on the days that the kids eat for free.     Bring back that original Southwest Fajita Salad...it was awesome but was discontinued a few years ago.

A good place to get your car washed.  I like to have a clean car and have been having mine washed at various places for a while now.  I have tried a lot of places but BJ's was a bit too far for me.  One day I was there so I tried it, and it is a lot better than the places I used to go to. They spend a lot more time cleaning your car than any other place I have been, and I have been to a lot. I got their discounted VIP gift card.  I also had an oil change there and other service done.  All was good.   The prices are a bit higher but with gift cards and coupons you can get them back down.        The only down side is that I let the glass people who rent a space there change my windshield.  I understand that the glass company has nothing to do with BJ's other than being a tenant and renting space there so that they can serve the BJ customers.  The glass company missed their first appointment with me, then they did a poor job replacing the windshield, they left it dirty and the rubber on top was not correctly attached.  They would not do anything about it, but their sales people still call me almost daily, 6 months after it was done, to see if I have any other glass needs.  I wish they would just kick the glass people out.  I don't hold BJ's at all responsible for the glass people.

Low knowledge employees.  High prices, and they don't even let you use their bathrooms.   Bad all around experience.  The only good thing is their clearance sections where they have a few decent deals sometimes.   They are rude, I doubt I will ever shop here again.

I have been going here for over 15 years, you get a lot here for your money.  It is a better deal than any other restaurant like it.  You can feed your whole family of 4 for under $20 with ease.    I love that they offer free hot tea, it is always good plus, and most of their lunch specials are just $5.45 and come with soup, rice and a lot of food, so much that I am usually stuffed when I leave.    As is custom with most Asian places, they have a separate menu for dinner, that is about 50% more pricey.  But don't feat they have dinner specials for $8 that are almost twice as big as the lunch ones, so big that we usually split just one and then order a large side of rice and a small appetizer and our whole family is stuffed, usually with leftovers, and all for way under $20.    Their service is quick once you order, I usually know what I want before I even go inside, so the 5 min or so it takes before they take your order is a bit long.  As soon as you order you get soup, then 2-3 min later your food is there...really just 2-3 min....

If you are looking for quality BBQ this is the place to go.  The service is friendly and the portions are huge.  The building and dining area could use some improvements, the table cloths are a bit old and the color is unappealing.  The brisket is what I usually order, sometimes it is awesome, other times it is just ok.    They are friendly towards are kids and the noise they make, they often have loud music so you don't notice the sounds kids make.  The portions are huge, way more than it is comfortable to eat, and the prices are fair for the amount.  It would almost be better to get 20% less for a 20% lower price.

This is our Regional park.  This is the biggest and best park in the city of peoria.  It is a nice and decent park with a huge rec center.  Too bad it costs a lot to use the rec center.  Also the playgrounds were really nice when this was built but they have not been maintained well.  One of the best spinning rides broke down a few times so their reaction was to just remove it instead of fixing it.    Also the bathroom near the playgound is always smelly, and is NOT air conditioned, which means that much of the time it is over 100 degrees in there, AND they have metal toilets, who thought of this great idea?  The BBQ area is really good, the ramadas are nice.  They have a splash pad area, but it is not open late enough and it closes way to early in the year, even though it is still hot.  I think that it should be open every day that the forecast is over 90 degrees.

This is an Asian grocery, it is very large, used to be an Albertsons, they even have a lot of the Albertsons murals and items in this store.  It used to be awesome but recently they have cut back on inventory, there is now a large section of the store that is just empty, I have heard rumors that they are going to go out of business.  It has a lot to offer, they carry a lot of hard to find foreign things, from many different nations.    The prices are cheap on some things but high on others like rice.  Their meat is usually at least 30% cheaper than most stores near this, and is of higher quality, we get almost all of our meat from Lee Lee's now.  They also have a wide selection of seafood, but the prices are not as good at the other meats.  Their veggies are also priced very inexpensively.    During the summer and winter when they heat and cool the place there is a lot of fresh air and the place smells decent, but during the times of the year when they don't need to heat or cool much it gets a heavy fish smell often.  I am glad they are there to provide the foreign items that we crave, and meat and veggies at good prices, I hope they stay around.

The best place to watch a movie in this part of town.  I love harkins, and this one specifically is clean and new, and always full of friendly staff.    Tips....always buy a gift card for $25 before you buy your tickets, you get a free popcorn that way.  Then always pay the extra $1 to make the free popcorn LARGE, then you can take the bag out, leave it in your car, and get a free refill next time.  I always get popcorn and never pay for it other than the $1 every other time.  AWESOME!   They also have this really great powder you can put on the popcorn.

I won't be going back here.   The service was slow.  I don't drink beer, and I guess they really expect you to here.  The food was the best part, it was large and fairly good, but took forever to get.  It was loud, and uniforms and rowdy beer drinkers and sports watchers make is very bad for families.  They have a ton of TV's with different sport things, all loud.

First off I like Wells Fargo, I do my business there with very little problems.  This branch is close to my house so I went there.  When it first opened a few years ago this was a very nice branch, with nice and helpful people.    Now they have had 2 managers in a row, with the current one, Orlando Gutierrez being particularly horrible.  He is rude, egotistic and like to break the rules of his own company.  He, and his people have been reported to mess with peoples accounts without permission, open accounts to meet quotas without permission and closing his branch early on many occasions.    Top this off him and the personal bankers at this branch are rude, and unhelpful.  The last two times I went there customers were yelling in the branch because they are so upset at these people.    I went to another branch today to do my business, I told them that I had a bad experience at Wells Fargo and they guessed it was this branch and Orlando that were so bad.  The worker at the other branch said that most people who work there either quit or leave, and that he personally processed 14 complaints about that branch in the last month.    Whatever you do, help yourself out and don't visit this branch, there are too many nice people at other branches in the area to make yourself deal with this.

Good food, way too costly.   We have been there a few times, it is a good place to eat a lot of Sushi cheaply.  The Sushi is good quality but often runs out and takes up to 20 minutes to be restocked, I guess they hope people will get full.  The last time we were there they decided to raise their prices WHILE we were eating, They don't give you the bill until you are done eating, when we arrived right after they opened that day it was the normal price, 80 minutes later when we got the bill they had a much higher price of $18 for kids and $24 for adults, I was shocked by this.  Well I guess it was a really busy day and while we were eating they posted a small hand written sign below the normal prices saying that today the prices would be higher.  There was no difference in the food.    I told them I would not pay the higher price, that it was unfair and not disclosed.  We had a large party and it made almost $100 difference.  The workers were almost crying because they said that the owner was very mean and would deduct any shortfall from their meager pay.  I don't know if this was a ploy or if the owner was really this abusive of their immigrant workforce who did not know any better.  I told them to get the owner on the phone, they did and after 5 minutes of argument she finally relented and let me pay the normal, still very high price.  I won't be going back to this place.  I only give them 2 stars instead of 1 because a few of the dishes are really good, and they have a large selection of desserts.

Lots of food to choose from.  It was not busy when we got there so some of the food was cold.  The hibachi grill was good.  The sushi had no tuna at all, and was not totally fresh, they did not have the types I liked but was good still.  The dessert was large and had many good choices including 8 types of ice cream.   If it was more busy I bet the food would have been even better.  As it was it was better than the other west valley Asian buffets I gave been to.

I have had a hard time with getting good repairs in the past, but this place has always found the time to fit me in when I needed something done in a hurry.  They also have fixed a few vehicles of mine that had multiple issues with them.    There was only one time they were not able to fix a problem that I had, that was with the wiring of the speakers, because the former owners of that car really screwed it all up.  They have a great deal on Oil changes.

So the food here is awesome.  They sell the same things that many places like this sell but here it just tastes better, you get is fresher.    The prices are average for many things, and a bit higher than average for pizza and some of the sandwiches, but this is because they use higher quality ingredients.  The only negative I can think of is that they are VERY cramped, they have a small place, and their success makes it full most of the time when we go.  It is nice to see them have success though.    I am also a late eater, and we have shown up a few times at closing and they still took care of us.  I think if they closed at 10pm they would have even more success.....but more work.

So first off I don't drink coffee.  I like a few of the other things that they sell here.  I think the Warm chocolate drink for kids is great, my kids love it, the price is cheap and the cup is so nice you can use it for a month after buying it.    As a non coffee drinker I get the smoothies, I have only been here 5 times, and at least 2 times they gave me something for free.  The people here are nice and generous.  But the cost of the smoothie when I do pay for this is crazy high.  Almost $6 for a basic smoothie that does not even have fruit is kinda high.

OK, Sushi from a fast food place in a mall......that would lower anyones expectations but WOW this place really does a great job, they have good tasting food at great prices.  Usually Sushi places serve really small portions but this place serves more than you expect.    The owner is really friendly, also he remembers us every time.    They offer their Sushi for just 2 for $5, and for the Sushi-mi it is just $3.99....but near the end of the day they will also give the Sushi-mi for 2 for $5 also.    So great deals, decent food, friendly service...sounds like a good place to go again and again....
