Glad I used Yelp and found this tucked away treat. Open air seating and live music at the right volume for dining. We dined on enchiladas and the pulled pork dish. The green chili cornbread was a super side item. Take your time and enjoy. Our food came out in less than seven minutes.

Delicious food...great service, leaving a two star review due to employees loitering out front. We were staying with friends in loft above restaurant and employees sat at entrance and smoked leaving cigarette butts and trash in the planters. I heard management has been asked to stop this, but evidently it continues. I will change to a five star if this is corrected.

Great place. We split the divers scallops and a rossa sausage pizza. Food was great and the food arrived quickly on a Saturday night. We were too full for the dessert menu, but it looked great.
