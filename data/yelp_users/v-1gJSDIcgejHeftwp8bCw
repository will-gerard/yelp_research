I totally agree with Marcus P. They ruined my teeth 4 years ago. Now I have to spend big bucks to get implants.

When 20 people show up for dinner it's not right for the manager to tell them to go for a two hour walk and he'll call when they have a table ready. There were at least 2 vacant tables that we could see from the street.  He was very arrogant. I am only giving one star because there is no option for 0 stars .

There is nothing like ordering a half slab of ribs and finding hair in my food. That's pretty disgusting.  The manager came out and apologized. He comped my meal and ordered more ribs for me. The second slab came out. I actually enjoyed them until I came to the last rib. There was another hair baked into the sauce! Manager came out again,  apologized profusely and comped the  whole table. This was my first and last time at this restaurant!

The food is great, but the service leaves a lot to be desired. I particularly dislike it when the hostess says "How are we doing tonight"? Then the server says "what would we like to eat tonight?" when he come back to take the order.  That's so rude and condescending. We got the bum's rush as far as service is concerned. We were in and out in 35 minutes! I never got offered a refill on my iced tea either! Next time I am going to one of the independent Italian restaurants in town.

Lavie Nails and Spa is a wonderful place to go if you want to feel pampered. Cindy Vong, the owner and her staff are very professional. I have had manicures, pedicures and facials there. I really enjoy the time I spend there.  Cindy is also very active in the (Gilbert, AZ) business community. She goes out of her way to promote other people's businesses.  Next time you want a manicure, pedicure or facial, try Lavie. You'll be glad you did!

This is a great place to go for some pampering. Cindy and her staff are very professional and accomodating. I go there for relaxing manis, pedis and facials.
