I've tried food from here three more times, it keeps getting worse. The quality just keeps sinking.  Most of the food tastes like reheated frozen food. Actually, I've had better frozen italian from the grocery store.  Big portions of ill tasting food, and not cheap either.

SAVE YOURSELF!!  Don't be lured in by the coupon you received!!  Truly awful steaks! Bad cuts, bad cooking! Why did my steak taste like fuel?! Why couldn't I cut it with my knife?!  Was that green thing with the oily white stuff a salad?

I've been coming to Coffee Rush off and on through at least 3 sets of owners over the past decade.   The decor has improved a mite and they offer Wi-Fi now. Other than than everything about this place is worse than it was.  The coffee is worse. The barristas are less friendly and less knowledgeable. And the prices are more expensive.  The parking is as difficult to get in and out of as always since the shop is located on a dead end dogleg of the strip mall.  The location of the shop next to the man made lake could be a boon, except for: the obnoxious teenagers, the bird and duck crap, the clouds of cigarette smoke, and the variety of insect life.  If you're looking for a noisy after party hangout, this'll do.   If you want good coffee in a comfortable environment - avoid.

This particular Coffee Bean is my "home" coffee shop. All others are judged by this standard.  The customer service here is always tops. The coffee here is always superior to Starbucks and vastly superior to many independent coffee purveyors.  CBTL maintains this standard through consistently good quality ingredients and standardization of procedures.  That said CBTL does not have "outstanding" coffee, but rather products that never disappoint in an environment that is always welcoming and friendly. The staff here and at the Scottsdale location have always been very polite and professional, while still being welcoming.

The staff is still great here, unfortunately some changes to their teas and coffee extracts forces me to lower they're rating.   The new coffee extract is much more bitter than it used to be and leaves an aftertaste with an astringent quality. Yes, I actually feel thirstier after drinking an extract infused drink.  The company has also moved from whole leaf tea to cut leaf. The change has also resulted in a more bitter tea than before, more of a grass quality.  Their constantly changing menus are intensely annoying also.  Sad to say, if it wasn't for the great staff here - I'd probably just go to Starbucks for my quick fix coffee.

Shimogamo is easy to miss tucked away in the corner of this strip mall next to C-Fu Gourmet. Make the effort to find it, it's well worth it!  Not a huge raw fish fan, so I always keenly interested in the other stuff a "sushi" place serves. This place has a great selection!  From dumplings to tempura to soup. There's plenty deliciousness to find here even if your not in the mood for sushi or sashimi.  However, if you are in the mood for fishy - this place is hard to beat. Great variety, excellent preparation, and wonderful service.    Very intimate and always busy, this is one of those place that you just have to experience for yourself.

Just finished another meal here courtesy of a gift card.  This place is always busy and I've never been able to understand why. If no one ever gave me a gift card here, I would never eat here.  The service varies from very good to awful, but the food always never exceeds "well, it didn't make me sick."  Today's meal failed even that low standard. As an appetizer I ordered some mini-corn dogs. I *love* corn dogs. At the fair, from Weinerschnitzel, from frozen at home, and so on.  These little balls of corn meal enriched pancake batter were deep fried to near burnt and yet managed to soak up enough grease to squeeze out nice puddle of oil. I only ate one, but within five minutes I was nauseas.   The California omelet was not much better. Sour cream shouldn't curdle, right? The veggies and cheese were barely cooked. It was more like a salad wrap, where the wrap happened to be egg. If I had wanted a salad with egg, I'd have ordered a Cobb, not an omelet.  The banana cheese cake was good according to the spousal unit & I enjoyed my strawberry lemonade.  Still have $10 left on the gift card. I think that'll get me a couple of lemonades.

Having dined here around a dozen times for various meals in the past two months, I figured it was time to write a review for Liberty Market.  Liberty Market has lived up to their own stated principles with amazing regularity and I applaud the owners and staff on this accomplishment. Too often businesses fail to even have guiding principles, let alone meet them.  Overall rating of good to awesome on the food, and a rating of very good on the staff - with a nod to outstanding service provided by Kiersten on a couple of occasions.  Of particular recommendation: The biscuits and gravy, the tower burger, the best chicken sandwich, and the bacon. Also the E-61 bar!  While some people complain about the selectiveness of a customer, as a paying customer is not my correct place to choose the item I wish to pay for? You may say, "all the pieces taste the same." If they do then your taste buds need an upgrade.   Liberty Market has provided consistently satisfying food with a polite and competent staff. I look forward to dining there again and bringing friends.  Thus sayeth the "beaten pet" and "mushroom shaped" lady.

Lunch - 1 salad, 1 soup, 2 entr√©es, 2 desserts = $80 !!! For lunch ?!?!?  $10 for an appetizer size bowl of soup is absurd. $9 for a basic Caesar salad? The kicker? $25 for a *lunch* portion of fish!  The food was all good, but terribly overpriced. Would return for the food, but not at these prices.

Freakin Awesome Food!  I've eaten here at least twice a month for the past year and I am still discovering new tastes on the menu!  There's so much goodness and variety on their menu that trying to review it all would take me hours. Fantastic for eat in or take out you have to try it yourself.

Came here for a late lunch and was a bit disappointed. The service was polite, but very slow.   The "salad" bar had a variety of less than flavorful dishes, most leaning toward the "pickled" or "vinegary" side.  I felt the tabouli had way too much parsley and lacked the fresh taste you would expect. The hummus tasted burnt. The very simple egg salad was my personal favorite.  The meat offering at lunch is reduced from the dinner offerings. Sirloin, Top Sirloin, Tri-Tip, Roast Beef, Chicken, Ham, and Pork Sausage. Much of the meat was over done outside and nearly uncooked inside. The meat quality is lower than expected for this price range, too much fat and connective tissue.  The ham was ok, but had the kind of texture and taste one normally associates with a pre-cooked canned ham. The chicken tasted over smoked, that is to say ash like. All of the meats seemed to have been flavored with the same spice combination, and therefore exuded a uniform taste as you moved from dish to dish. The Tri-tip stood out as being the most flavorful and stood up the best to the uneven cooking.  The desert tray looked interesting but we did not partake. The alcohol prices were a bit high and we did not partake.  Overall it was ok, I can't recommend it - nor would I go again for myself, but I probably wouldn't turn down a free meal there.

This is one of those restaurants that is so consistently good, I've nearly taken it for granted. It's also tucked away in a corner and not easily visible from Elliot or McClintock - so it's easy to pass by.  I can always count on friendly hosts,  pleasant and effective wait staff, and tasty food. I don't like calling it "safe", but I can take a group with disparate palettes here and be sure everyone will find something they like.  My favorite dish is the Cannelloni Rossini. Wonderful flavor and texture. I think it could use a little "kick", but it is certainly NOT bland.  This place stays pretty busy in the evenings so make a reservation or relax on the patio for a short wait.

Having been here a few times, I'm definitely between "Yay! I'm a fan." and "A-OK".  Dessert: Really good. Croissants: Fairly good. Coffee: Needs help.  I've enjoyed every dessert I've had here.  The croissants are usually good, but a few times the dough has tasted decidedly pasta-like and not so fluffy.  The coffee really lets down the noms. I prefer to get my coffee over at Cartel down the street and bring it with me or vice-versa.

Having not eaten here since this was Chops, I decided it was time. Very pleasantly surprised!   Pub food with a cajun slant. Things I didn't like: The decor, the seats, the darkness, or their logo. Staff being in street clothes was a little confusing, I almost elbowed the busser when he reached across the table for an empty plate.  Forget all that. The food was really good!  The meal opened with fresh ciabatta bread (w oil/vinegar) and side salads loaded with cheese, bacon, eggs, tomatoes, carrots, onions, etc - or not! They customized each one! Other places would call this a cobb salad and charge you $6+ for it; here it was included with our entree.  The sirloin slider appetizers are basically little mini french dip sandwiches. Shaved beef w jack cheese topped with crispy onion strings and served with both creamy horseradish and au jus. This is a meal unto itself.  The sweet potato fries were thick yet crispy, crispy not greasy tater tots, and Sour cream potatoes au gratin were just a few of the scarfable potato sides, and they have non-potato sides too!  It's been ages since I had a blackened catfish that I would recommend, and here it is at Iguana Mack's! Nice charred crust without over cooking the fish. Not too much cayenne or rosemary in the seasoning, nice balance of flavors! Like I said before, recommended!  Looking forward to coming back and trying some of the other menu items.

There are some mighty fine BBQ joints in the Phoenix area - This ain't one of them.  The good: The people were friendly and helpful. The restaurant is laid out nicely and clean. The selection of side dishes is good. Tasty rolls. They carry Big Red soda.  The So-So: The ribs, what a shame. The texture and taste seem to indicate they were steamed or boiled. They are fall of the bone soft, but lack anything resembling flavor. My spare ribs had a ton of cartilage.  The BBQ sauce was not bad, not inspired, but certainly better than the ribs they were on. The potato salad did more of a service to the BBQ sauce than the ribs.  The Bad: The price! $19 for a rack of less than mediocre ribs!  I'm not likely to voluntarily return here soon.

I have't been to a Waffle House in 20 years... Now I remember why.  If you're looking quick, cheap, greasy spoon type food... Don't come here, it falls far below that standard.  Not any cheaper than a comparable meal at Ihop or Denny's, with much lower quality. The food at Flying J and Petro blows Waffle House out of the water.  Thin chewy waffles, undercooked hash browns, pasty sausage gravy, super salty diaphanous bacon...all rubbish.  Even the butter was some sort of "butter like" spread in an individual serving tub.  The premises were wet. Having come off 4 days of rain I was willing to give some latitude. Then I encountered the smell.  Upon peering behind the counter I discovered a small marsh which, at a guess, was caused by backup or overflow from the dishwasher.  Why won't yelp allow me to give a zero rating?

The customer sevice and ambiance here are always great. The managers have always taken care of any issue we've ever had.  The prime rib is really, really good! So is the Steak Au Poivre!  That said, I have to admit that the rest of the food can be pretty hit and miss. I've never had  awful food here, but several disappointments. The managers and staff are so polite and work so hard to make things right that we keep coming back.  The pricing is a bit high for the inconsistent quality, but well worth the early bird and happy hour pricing.

The claim to fame for Grimaldi's is the crust, which is not bad.  I really enjoyed the toppings much more than I expected! The sauce is slightly sweet but not cloying, generously applied but not soupy. The cheese is obviously a fresh whole milk mozzarella, very tasty! And the pepperoni was good and zesty!  Having had the pie carryout and dine-in, I have to recommend dine-in for the freshness of the experience. The crust does lose a little something after sitting in a box for awhile.   Overall I would give the pie a 9/10 for an above average pizza. After the closure of Zza's in downtown Chandler, Grimaldi's is now my favorite pizza place. Man I wish I could get delivery here!

J&J presents a real reviewing dilemma.  I've been getting pies from here since they opened.  I didn't like it.  I tried again a few months later, the pie was awesome!  I tried again a week later, back to bad.  Over the last couple of years J&J has maintained this hit and miss pattern. The pies are more often really good than bad, and are rarely really bad.  That said, the last two pies I had were both bad. With the last one so bad I didn't finish a single slice.  The cheese was clumped and uncooked in spots. The sauce was over the top with crushed pepper, too spicy for a regular pizza. The crust was soggy AND burnt in places. Maybe the oven wasn't clean or the temp was off, but in any case a total failure of quality control!  So how do I rate them? Based on their best pie? Their worst? Some imaginary average?  Well, I chose the latter. I based my rating on the probability of a good product. Honestly though, I'm not likely to get a pie here for quite a while. There are simply too many other really good pizza places, why risk it here?  Caveat Emptor friend!

Somehow I have forgotten to review Joe's Farm Grill.  However, judging by their current reviews, they've not suffered for it.  What can I say that hasn't already been said?  Joe's Farm Grill is too popular, I hate standing in line.  There, there's my complaint.

What's to say? It's a pub with good food.  Good burgers, good unique appetizers - really decent fish & chips. Surprisingly, for a pub, the noise level isn't too bad here due to good interior structure and keeping the music at a reasonable (but listenable) volume. You can actually have a conversation with table mates, unlike Cornish Pasty Co which is just up the street.  Have not been disappointed by the food or service.

I'm really surprised at some of the lackluster reviews. Sometimes when I read yelp reviews I get the feeling some reviewers feel chain restaurants can do no right! How unfair!  I believe Benihana is one such place. If you're coming for the show, great - I've seen it. You may enjoy it.  I come for the food and service.  I have been consistently impressed with both.  Steak, chicken, shrimp, scallops, sashimi, sushi, sushi rolls, the onion soup, the vegetable tempura, and so on.  I have infrequently had issues with the food. I told them it was unacceptable and it was whisked away to be replaced with more than acceptable food. No grumbling, fussing, evil looks, or exasperated sighs - just a quick fix of the issue.  I have never had any issue with the wait staff.   We had an issue with one chef once. He simply couldn't get things right, he even dropped his knife. We didn't even say anything, but the manager showed up, brought us desert AND comped our entire meal. That speaks to the watchfulness of the management and their commitment to quality.   My spouse can be a very particular eater. Yet we have returned time and again here because they get it right.  The only thing that keeps it from 5 stars are the hours (they're closed between 2pm and 5pm right in the middle of MY lunch time), and they can be a bit pricey.

Awsome food! If you're looking for fancy, dainty, or any adjective other than basic - forget it.  Real back to fundamentals food!  Burger - beef, fried, nothing else. (with cheese is default) No special sauce or secret seasonings, just real meat. They do have a "garnish" bar - but don't look for the lettuce.  Fries - potatoes, fresh cut before your eyes, then fried - in lard.  Coke - cold, in a glass bottle, made with real sugar.  Enjoy your burger, fries, and a Coke unadulterated!

Nice decor.  Chocolate was chalky and the drink left a sour, cloying aftertaste on the palate. Not crazy about the roast here. It was a bit acrid and contributed to the overall sour flavor of the drink.   I ended up leaving half my drink.  They use Monin chocolate syrup here. I'm not sure where they get their roast from, forgot to ask.  The service was polite and prompt. May try again, but not in any rush.

First - The service was prompt and polite. Kudos to the wait staff.  The brunch menu looks amazing. The reality was not.  The Promise: Corned Buffalo hash w/ poached eggs, 4 slices of thick cut bacon, and a biscuit with gravy.  The Reality: The corned buffalo hash wasn't a hash at all. A hash would indicate the meat and potatoes are in some way mixed.  About 4oz of the corned "meat" - I say "meat" because it was so generic it could have been nearly anything - was apparently pulled from the stew pot (still quite soupy) and laid atop 5 halves of fingerling potatoes (yes 5, I'm not sure why the odd number).  Even more sad, half of the meat was a lump of fat. Not just some connective tissue, an impenetrable squishy blob of fat.   The poached eggs were ok.  The bacon was awesome tasting, although too tough to cut with a fork and requiring some serious chewing to really enjoy.  The biscuit and gravy was fairly good. Not traditional as it has a very sweet taste. The biscuit required a knife and fork to get trough the crust, but still not bad tasting.  The Aftermath: At a cost of $32 for one plate of less than inspring food - I'll only be back if someone else is dragging me and paying.

Wow! What a surprise! Go Here!  Tucked in the lobby of the Shereton Airport hotel at 52nd St & Broadway in Tempe.   My big complaint: the chairs are too low to the ground. That's it.  Appetizers: Ravioli in cream sauce, Pan grilled soft cheese (NOT mozzarella), shredded chicken nachos, hot & spicy shrimp.  Pre-meal: Tortilla soup w/chicken & avocado, Southwestern style salad w/blue cheese.  Meal: Center cut Angus filet w balsamic reduction & Spicy Shrimp.  Dessert: Chocolate Kahlua Mousse Pie - Decadent!, Creme Brulee, Deep Fried Ice Cream.  I don't really have anything to comment on because everything was so good! Been here twice looking forward to visit number three!

One of my top 10 meals *ever*!!   Some how I forgot to write this review the night of.  Probably because of the haze of gastronomic bliss I was floating in.  This meal was on Valentine's day, the 24th my wife and I have celebrated together. From the endive salad start to the white chocolate panna cotta finish - every dish was crafted with passion and precision.  The improvisational nature of the menu doesn't mean loss of control of your dinner. It means you get exactly the flavors you like delivered as a wonderful surprise dish. I was amazed that my wife and I (who have Very different palettes) each received dishes to delight us.  This is a MUST visit restaurant. If I could afford it, I'd be here once a week. It is a bit costly for a night out, but worth every penny.  The owner, chefs, kitchen brigade and service staff made this an amazing experience. My thanks to all of you.

Neo-Traditional British Bistro Cuisinie Meets American Dive Bar  First impressions - Very warm inside the restaurant, strong curry smell.  Loud unintelligible heavy bass "music" playing. Feels more like a dive bar than an eatery.  Friendly, knowledgeable staff. Good selection of beers.  Small tables and booths, definitely not designed with comfort in mind. I can't say the music is bad, but very hard to understand because it's all bass and no treble - I think there are vocals...  The red wine sauce provided would be at home in a beef burgundy but for a cottage pie? Not so much. Cottage pie pasty was dry and lacked the Worcestershire sauce flavor one would expect. Basically just ground beef and mashed potatoes.  The crust was too crisp, dry and crumbly, not flaky. Had I been a Cornish miner, my lunch would have fallen in my lap upon the first bite.  That's not to say the pastry didn't taste good, but it crumbled upon first contact with a knife. Luckily I had a knife, fork, and plate as my filling needed to be scooped after any attempt to penetrate the crust.  The "Pilgrim" pasty came with a side of Stuffing....eh. The contents of the "Pilgrim" were less dry and tasted more like the intended turkey dinner than the cottage pie resemled its intended target dish. This dish came with cranberry sauce....eh. The red wine sauce went much better with this than it did with the other pasty.

Last time I ate here I left a rather scathing review, so I figured it was time for a second visit.  Unfortunately I must have gone to the wrong restaurant because the food here was great!  Pastry was spot on this time. Firm, but not crumbly! I could cut it without the entire structure failing. I was even able to pick  up the pasty and eat it traditional - a la hand.  I had the Cottage Pie (same as last time) and the taste difference was immediately noticeable. The ground beef was moist but not fatty and there was cheese! I don't remember cheese last time.  For personal taste: I still think it needs more veggie, less potato, and a splash of Worcestershire.  I also had the Oven Chips w/ Garlic - Awesome! If you've ever eaten the garlic fries at other places like Gordon Biersch, these blow them away! Real crushed garlic on real thick cut potatoes, slightly caramelized from baking. Not some rub-on paste placed on deep fried frozen battered spud strips.  Now the complaints: 1) The Noise - still too much loud bass. The walls, floor, and ceiling are all hard surfaces. The conversations and music bounce off these surfaces and create a cacophony neutralizing most conversation.  2) The Parking - there is no handicapped parking available anywhere near the restaurant. What parking there is, is cramped and narrow. Parking a pick-up was a challenge. Even the people in the Toyota Camry had issues maneuvering.

I've been here quite a few times since my original review, and am happy to say the food has been consistently really good!  I still think it's too noisy inside and lament the lack of handicap parking, but won't let that deter me from coming and enjoying the fare.  Now that the EU has decided "Cornish" Pastys can only be made *in* Cornwall I'm wondering if this place will have to change its name. :-0

I had the opportunity to eat here last week. It's a bit of a drive from Chandler, but definitely worth it.  Wonderfully cooked meats and tasty sauce!  I f you live north of the 101 loop and aren't here regularly you are doing yourself a disservice. Even if you live a bit further away (for me it's about 45 miles), it's worth the trip at least once a month.   I sampled the standard menu: the brisket, the ribs, the pulled chicken, and the pulled pork. They were all good, but for me the standout was the pulled pork. Tender, fall apart chunks of smokey goodness!  I'll have to try some of the seasonal and specialty items next time I go. Don't forget they can pack stuff for you to take home! Bring your cooler!

I haven't made the drive up in a while, but have had some good friends shuttle me provisions from here.   This stuff is really good, even reheated after refrigeration! Pulled pork still my fave, but I won't say no to anything on the menu!

Gyro Wrap, Pepperoni Pizza, Medium Buffalo Wings, Pendulum White Pizza, Chicken Wrap.  All very tasty, delivered fast. Not my favorite style crust, not really thin, not really thick, not crisp and crusty - just kind of generic. The toppings were very good as was the sauce.  The wings are a variation on the traditional seasoning, and seem to have more black pepper content. Still very tasty.  Too much lettuce for me on the wraps, but the meat and dressings were good.  My spouse enjoyed the white pizza very much.

Had a spa day here with the wife.  Never been to a spa let alone had a whole spa day. If you're into "pampering" this is probably a very enjoyable experience. I find I am simply too utilitarian to appreciate the nuanced art.  I found the hot rock massage to be very therapeutic and relaxing. The salt scrub felt good, but I'm unsure of its therapeutic value or efficacy in exfoliation.  The shower/steam room is completely tile, which looks very nice, but made for treacherous standing/walking when the floor was wet. Even worse because you are generally covered in oil when you go into the room.The shower could use more pressure. Trying to get off salt and massage oil was difficult in the weak spray.   The steam was nice, but there's no antechamber to store your towel, robe, or slippers. Meaning you either leave your stuff in the hallway or it gets steamed/showers with you.  I also had a facial, manicure, and pedicure. As I've never had any of these before I have no basis for comparison. They weren't painful.  The people here were very nice. Took the time to try and explain the various procedures both before and during them.  I don't think I would go for a full "spa day" again as it was quite expensive, but I would go back when I have a need for individual services. The massage was exceptional.

Crowded, disorganized and overpriced.  The tea selection is ok, but mostly "fashion" teas. 2 ounces of basic Orange Roiboos set me back $16!  No organized lines for drinks or just loose tea. Way too small of a space for as much stuff as they crammed in there. And as there is only one portal, people on their way out have to fight people on their way in!  I'll be going elsewhere for my tea supplies.

Just awful. Way undercooked crust. It was supposed to be a thin crust but might have been an attempt at a "double dough". The crust was barely even dry, not a spot of browning anywhere.  The "Sicilian Deep Dish"  was the same crust as the thin BUT they turned up the edges. Woo Hoo! NOT a deep dish. The mushrooms smelled like used socks. The   The medium buffalo wings were tasty, but PLAIN wings. A little grease and hot sauce at the bottom.   The delivery was over an hour when promised in 30 minutes.   At over $50 for this meal I can only be grateful I don't have to order from them again. I'd rather have had a slice of white bread with a bottle of ragu and swiss. Yeah, that bad.  What a shame. If you were a fan of the Zza's - the pizza place that used to be here - AVOID the new place at all costs!!

Nothing to see here, move along.  Mediocre food. Bland. Overcooked. Gummy/Pasty Pasta.  Not horrible, but with the number of really good independent Italian restaurants in the valley - why waste your time and money?  Specifics:  Manicotti - Filled with a tasteless ricotta cheese paste that could double as drywall filler, topped with warm crushed tomatoes and a couple shreds of melted mozzarella.  Fettuccine Alfredo - The pasta was sticky and gummy. The "Alfredo" sauce was a plain white sauce with flecks of something that may have been an attempt at seasoning.  Italian Sausage - Way overcooked, dry, like trying to saw wood when cutting into it. Nicely spicy though.  Chicken Piccata - Beaten and lightly fried the cutlet was nonetheless dry. Topped with a mixture of mushrooms, capers, and tomatoes. Not just topped, buried under. Disappointing and still the best dish served.

Wow! What a pleasant surprise! A little tough to find tucked into the back corner of this strip mall on the Southeast corner of Gilbert Rd. and Southern - but so worth the effort.  Be warned - they have some odd hours. Only open lunch hours on Tuesday & Wednesday til 4pm. Open til 8 Thursday - Saturday.  Found this place from a Groupon and so glad I did. The fry bread was perfect and NOT greasy!  Had the "Cheesesteak" feature and enjoyed the heck out of it. Don't expect a traditionally Philly, but the tender beef, cheese and onions won't disappoint. (I thought mine needed extra onions, but that's just me)  The red chili meat with cheese was also delicious!  Make sure to have some of the Jalepe√±o dip!  A little zest, but not too spicy. Almost like a spread, not drippy.  Friendly staff and generous tasty food makes me look forward to going back here!

Opening week and... it's really, really good!  Stopped in for breakfast and sampled a few items.  Started with the pastry plate, which today was slices of scones: Chocolate Chip, Raspberry, and Raisin. IMO they were a little dense, almost a scone cookie - but still tasty.   The BLD Iced Coffee was different. A blend of Irish Creme and French Vanilla coffees it was a bit too sweet for my palate, but my wife thought it was spot on.  My wife had the Short Rib Benedict with Fingerling/Shallot potatoes. She really enjoyed the entire entree and was reluctant to share with me. I prevailed and have to add my agreement, a very good dish!  I went a little more standard. Biscuits and Sausage gravy with Scrambled eggs and Chorizo potatoes. It was wonderful! Fluffy biscuits, tasty Sausage Gravy, eggs dry but not rubbery, nice chunks of red potatoes mixed with a good chorizo... remembering is making me hungry!  I thought the food was excellent. Impressive for an opening week. The service was warm and friendly, although our server had to return to the kitchen several times to fill in knowledge gaps.  I'm looking forward to coming back here to try L & D and definitely B again!

If you don't serve an egg substitue, say so. Chopped egg is not an egg substitue. Egg Whites are not an egg substitute.  A tablespoon of watery "gravy" over a nearly flat biscuit doesn't work. Bacon should be crisp and unburnt - ready to go. Not charred, flaccid and greasy - as if already spent.  Scrambled eggs should be fluffy, or at least not dry and rubbery. Unless stated on your menu, your eggs should not contain quantities of Black Pepper or other spices. This is dangerous. You don't know who might be violently allergic. Tasted bad to boot.  The chunk potatoes were undercooked, even though asked for crispy.  The tastiest part of the meal was the Chorizo potato soup. The Chorizo could have had several tablespoons of grease drained in the kitchen and would still have been quite greasy - and not floating across the plate. Still, it was the best dish of the morning. .sigh.  What was looking to be a promising new place is showing signs of apathy towards is customers already. Quality slipping, lame excuses by staff "we make our own egg substitute", - it's just disappointing. I may not be back for a while.

Absolutely horrid.  Uber thin burger that tastes like liver with plastic cheese topping.  French fries were ok, but small on portion.

Miserable. Where to start? Summary: expensive bad food with no eye toward customer service or food safety.   1) They don't open until an hour *after* the museum. So grabbing a caffeine boost or snack before walking is not possible.  2) They opened the museum interior doors more than 10 minutes late. Whereupon we discovered the doors to the sculpture garden had been open since *before* 11 - additionally the hostess was quite inconvenienced to have to notice there were people waiting at the entrance to be seated.  3) The menu selection is limited and expensive. Partially excused because it's in a museum, must gouge the public.  4) The expensive food is bad. Just bad. I paid $14 for some Gorton's fish sticks and Ore-Ida frozen fries (albeit liberally sprinkled with seasoned salt and a little Parmesan cheese).  5) The kitchen ignores allergy notifications. My dining partner has an allergy to black pepper and informed our server who assured us her salmon would not have any. The salmon did not have any, but every other piece of food on the plate was liberally doused in pepper. I had to wonder if it was done in spite.

Great range of choices for creating your sub. Just hope they get it right.  Of 6 visits in the past 2 months, 4 of the orders were wrong.  Additionally, the ingredient quality seems to be hit and miss.  The people here are very friendly and always try to make things right, but the mistakes have caused me to add this to my "Only if friends insist" list.

Miserable.   Our attempts at ordering were thwarted by a server with no knowledge of the menu. In his defense he was a hipster who had *only* been working there two months and apparently doesn't care about *anything* especially being able to do his job.   Our attempts at ordering were further thwarted by a chef/cook who was either unwilling or unable to create the first four items we tried to order. The fifth item ordered was the $22 polish sampler - which had 1 Go≈Çbaki, 3 Pierogies and 1 Polish Sausage. We were informed the Pierogies would all be of the same type (flavor/filling) and would be the cook's choice, additionally the type of sausage was unknown. Not very reassuring if your polish place can't tell you the difference between kielbasa and kabanos.  We finally settled on a pierogi appetizer, an order of go≈Çbaki, and the J√§ger Schnitzel. Regarding the pierogi - the menu says "We have different types of flavors everyday so please ask our friendly staff!" - we tried but were unable to find the friendly staff, so we asked our server (who didn't have a clue).  The pierogi selections were all potato filled, including the cheese one.  The pierogi aren't any better than the frozen Mrs. T brand at every grocer. The go≈Çbaki was an unspecified ground meat wrapped in cabbage with plain tomato paste covering it. The J√§ger Schnitzel might have been good, had it *any* seasoning - even just a little salt.  In summary, if you're seeking a good authentic Polish food restaurant - keep looking, this ain't it.

Fresh vibrant menu including reliable standards and tasty chef's specials. The staff never fails to provide great customer service and make sure your experience is satisfying.  If you're into cocktails, this is the place. If not - the food is good enough to warrant a visit alone.

So, Masa Sushi was really good!   Started with a pleasant miso soup and a salad. Tasty soup, basic salad.  Had the Tuna Tataki served with shredded Daikon, the tuna was soooo fresh and clean. Was great with a little wasabi and soy.  The tempura platter - scallops, Cali roll, shredded veggie thing.  All really tasty. Warning, they dot everything with a bit of Sriracha so if spicy isn't your thing...  Spouse enjoyed her Philadelphia roll and a bowl of Udon.  Very pleasant staff, good food, reasonable prices, all around enjoyable meal!

Polite, quick service inside and at drive-thru.  Have had the steak bagel several times and it is consistent.  I always dispose of the egg as it is the same rubbery puck you get on every fast food restaurant breakfast sandwich. As another reviewer mentioned it tends toward bland, but I found it needed only a bit of salt. Another way to improve the flavor profile is to get it on a sesame or everything bagel instead of the standard plain.  The rest of the sandwich offerings are about the same - nothing special, but not bad either.  The doughnuts are doughnuts. Dunkin is the only place I've found nearby that carries a chocolate glazed donut - where the doughnut is chocolate, not the glaze. This is my favorite type of doughnut, so until someone else starts making them, I'm hooked here.

Not horrible. No sandwich descriptions on the overhead menu. Staff couldn't tell me what was on the sandwiches or in the smoothies. No familiarity with the product they were selling.  Ordered safe: a BLT. Not so safe. Red onions, mustard, and cheese. Not outrageous, but not part of a standard BLT. If your product deviates significantly from the norm, say something.  Ordered safe: a French Dip. Again with the red onions - and this time an au jus with balsamic vinegar? Ok...  White chocolate macadamia nut cookie? Stale, but tasted ok. Eclair? Hard, hard P√¢te √† Choux filled with cheap whipped cream (possibly artificial).  Quick adds to original review:  The bread itself was tasty :-) My smoothie was chunky with unknowns :-(  Save your money, time, and taste buds.  Walk across the parking lot to Jimmy John's. They have a menu that tells you what is on their sandwiches.

You know how some places advertise serving authentic regional cuisine (Italian, Greek, Ethiopian, Chinese, etc) and say "Just like grandma used to make" - then it turns out grandma couldn't cook worth sh*t?  This is NOT like that!   Everything we sampled (Pollo Guisado, Pernil, Arroz con Gandules, Tostones, Carne Molida Pastelillos, Bistec Encabollado, and more) was not only authentic but flavorful and truly tasty!  This family owned and run place resisted the temptation to over spice with regional flavors and instead let your taste buds enjoy the subtle interplay of the multi-cultural influences which contribute to good Puerto Rican cuisine.  The beverages were standard fare and they do have malta available, but I missed having some good coffee with my meal.  Definitely a must visit again!  I hope their business is successful because I'd like to see them expand their hours and maybe add some traditional seafood offerings to the menu.
