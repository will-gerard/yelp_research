I miss this place every day.  Used to live right behind it, and took it for granted.  Simple and the yummiest.  Their Berenjena con Garbonzo is one of the most magical things I have ever put in my mouth.  Black bean fritters, ham croquettes-- everything is good.  OH!  Their cocktails!!

Best bar in Arcadia.  Best wings I have ever tasted.  Worst bathrooms in the Valley.  Arcadia, I miss you.

It took me a long time to find the right stylist in Phoenix/Scottsdale-- but these guys really know what they are doing.  I was a little wary at first, as it kind of looks like you might walk out looking like one of those skunky haired Scottsdale 20-something fashion victims.  Not so.   I have super thick hair and stylists tend to get lazy after the first hour and just start razoring-- never at Steven Paul.  Great place for waxing too!

My favorite thing about this place is the decor. It is crazy beautiful.  I also like that you can get better than average bar food until late and there are so many places to sit, you'll never have an issue with waiting.  Their food is okay, but nothing spectacular.   I used to live in Arcadia, and I miss it every day. If I were to move back to Phoenix/Scottsdale- I would never even consider a different neighborhood. Across the board, it is the friendliest and most beautiful neighborhood in Maricopa County.  That being said- The Vig represents the lame element of the neighborhood. People with too much money and bad taste. I think someone else called it "schmoozy" and that's exactly it!  As a neighbor, we usually rode our bikes- so I can't speak to parking. Do they not still have the shuttle?  Give me The Great Escape, JTs or Postinos any day.

When I lived closeby- this is where I went when I was feeling homesick for Portland food.   My personal favorites-   Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus= Perfect.  Lavosh Pizza= 2nd best thing anyone has ever done with Lavosh (RIP Pischke's).  Caramelized Cauliflower with Tahini= Duh  Lentil Fetoosh Salad= That LEMONY DRESSING!  Chicken Combination Platter= Perfect high protein lunch

Yep. As good as it gets. Jason is crazy talented and you would be a fool to look elsewhere.
