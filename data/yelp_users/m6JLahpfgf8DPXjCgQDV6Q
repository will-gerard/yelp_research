It's rare that you find good mechanics with integrity. Take your bike here if you want to walk away with a good feeling.

Best God damn sushi you'll have in this state. Little place but it's anything short of heaven. Good prices, good service, good music. Very impressed.

I'll  start off by saying that they have great employees and are very well staffed. Now that we got the positive stuff out of the way... Fox or whoever owns you guys should be ashamed. I know you want to appeal to the trendy man-bun types, but use some common sense. These dishes dont make sense. Raisins in curry? Hire someone to redo your menu. Also they only had 2 beers on tap and 4 empty keg slots. You have a chain of restaurants so you should know better. Get your shit in order.
