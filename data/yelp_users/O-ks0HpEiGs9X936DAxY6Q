My rating was going to be for E4 which is curently closed... I hope the owners read this and make some changes.  Through the grapevine I heard that one of the owners sold their liquor license (idiot thing to do for a nightclub in old town) and its now revamped as an 18+ club called afterlife... yay just what I always wanted.  A starbucks that you need to pay 20 dollar cover to walk around in.  Seriously... change it back.  I miss the old E4, it was my favorite chill spot and I would patronize it several times a week.  The bartenders were always awesome, the doorguys cool as can be and now... they have arcade games on the patio... FAIL!

Huge Menu, Friendly People, Good Food.  I really like oregano's for their wide selection.  I took my date here in lieu of cooking (unfortunate bill issues left me with no gas for a few days) and she ordered the ravioli and I got the BBQ chicken thin crust pizza.  It was really flavorful and I enjoyed it.  The only downside (which cost them that fabled 5 stars) was the fact that it is strictly call ahead seating.  This place gets BUSY... and when it gets busy the wait can be pretty bad because all of their food is made from scratch (you can taste it).  Other than that... fantastic meal and get the desert cookie thing they have.  SOOO Good!

Fantastic Martinis, Yes, Its pricey... you are on the top of Camelback Mountain at a critically acclaimed resort overlooking the valley having drinks, DUH!  Michael C (yelpmaster) recommended this place as an awesome place to bring a date and he was not lying!  Basil Grapefruit Martini OMG! Mouth is in heaven!

Dave, the owner, is an awesome guy to talk to.  I work at a computer shop down the way and I have gotten to know him and his staff well.  They are a great bunch of folks with some damn good food!  Thin crust pizza is something that I have missed since being out in AZ from NJ.  This pizza is something to write home about!

Michael C (our favorite Yelper) introduced me to this place when it was still Brackins Bar.  From the minute I stepped foot inside I knew I would be coming back for a long time.  The service is fantastic (even when it gets crazy busy on Friday or Saturday night), the new live music is awesome, and with Josh and Holly behind the bar couldn't make for a better night.  Tuesdays (when I usually go here) are relaxed and if you start commenting on some of their facebook stuff too... they might just put the drink you want on special!  :-) Thanks Holly!

Troy recently came by to install a new counter top as well as put up some monitor mounts at our Mesa store.  He was extremely professional, there on short notice, and did a FANTASTIC job.  The new oak counter top couldn't look better!  The monitor mounts weren't even a challenge for him (I wouldn't have wanted to touch it as they were going in brick) and he was done before I even thought possible.  You are the man Troy!

Ive been here twice, the only pitfall I see being the pretty outrageous cover they charge sometimes (I'm biased when it comes to paying anything for cover... I end up being the DD and paying cover to stand around and have a good time is ridiculous).  The first time I came I went to go joke around with the bartender when she asked me what I wanted to drink.  I said "I don't care as long as you make it for me in one of those buckets you have behind the bar".  She then surprisingly passed me a menu which had buckets of drinks on it and... well I was in heaven.  Good times with friends and the owner Bob is a really nice guy.  Highly recommended!

I enjoy local business.  I went to get a buffalo chicken wrap yesterday and the place seemed dead.  I was concerned about how good the food was even though the menu looked spectacular.  I was surprised on the quality that came out of the kitchen.  I munched down the wrap which was awesome and I was hungry for seconds- not due to actual hunger but because it was so dang good.  Im ordering a pizza today.  Lets see how it comes out.

If you are a true New Yorker and really want to have good pizza in Arizona this place is where it is at.  Thin crust pizza that makes your mouth water and taste buds go crazy this is the place.  Their lunch special (all you can eat for 6.95 pizza, pasta, and garlic knots) is amazing and their pies are pretty well priced too!  This is a family owned joint which I love and support with all my heart.  The owners are from NY and despite the NY reputation for harsh words and being brash they are some of the friendliest restaurateurs in the area.  I will continue to go here for amazing pizza until I move a significant way away.  This place is worth the drive!
