Victory Lanes is the premier venue for outdoor volleyball in the valley. They have 8 courts and keep them in good shape.  Many of the organizations in the valley run a number of different types of volleyball tournaments here from week to week and they also have an open play draw tournament on Friday nights during the warmer months.   It is nice to be able to play, grab a beers, maybe some food and enjoy the nice AZ weather.  You will have to pay a small fee to get in the park (normally $2.00) and they have open play most of the time that there is not a tournament going on.  The only real problem is it's location in relationship to the valley. It is so far north that it is a long drive for many of the volleyball players, so you don't always have much pick up play from night to night.

This is by far the best sandwich place in the whole valley in my opinion. I love sandwiches too!  The owners are great, super friendly and makes it a point to remember people and make them feel welcome, even when it is packed.  The food is awesome, and the service is fast. The prices are great. When I worked in the area I went there almost daily and it was cheaper than going to McDonalds etc to get a similar size meal. I tell everyone I know to go there, and you should check it out!

I'm writing about the volleyball courts on the north side of Tempe Town Lake. The courts are very nice with deep sand that was used across the bridge for the AVP events when the AVP used to come to Tempe. They are free to use and have sprinklers for the summer time when the sand gets hot.  The draw backs are the nets are pretty worn out and there are only portapotties for restrooms. The other problem is that the courts are set up east/west as opposed to north/south so the sun can be brutal depending on the time of the day.  All in all this is a nice facility and you can get pretty competitive games on Saturday mornings.

We used to go all the time, but the food sucked, it was a hole and the only good thing we used to say about it was it was a good place to take a sh....  Now they have let the only cool bartender go because he was a guy. Most of the girls were horrible and not all that to look at.   Plus they promote the free shuttle, but normally the guy who was suppose to drive it was too drunk to be the driver.  Time to find a new home in Chandler.
