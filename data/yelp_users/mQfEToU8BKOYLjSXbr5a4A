Nice ambiance and the food looks good, that is if you can get someone to it serve to you. We waited at a table for 15 minutes and I felt like I was behind the enchanted shield covering Story Brooke for all the notice we received. Any attempt to attract a waitress was as efficiently ignored as Fox News ignores the truth. I admit 3 waitstaff for 4 tables was probably taxing the abilities of the servers, so perhaps I need to cut them some slack. For your money, go to the George and Dragon.

I've been seeing Dr. Jacquelyn Wyman with the Pearson Eyecare group for over 25 years and would definitely recommend them and her to anyone. Great service, modern equipment, friendly staff and always willing to help!

I go here fairly often and can say the food and service are consistently good. The wait staff is friendly and the bartenders are great too. I really enjoy the Yellowfin tuna salad, and of course the the Gyros. The Fruit & Cheese Fantasia or Garlic Dip are great appetizers. They have a large outdoor patio and a full bar as well. Not too far of a walk from the Central/Roosevelt light rail stop.

I've been going here for years and even though I've moved to Chandler, I still make the drive. Great service and my hair looks great. AB (Abdiel) is the best and always very conscientious about his work. Takes the time to make sure it's right and you like it. Clean shop and friendly staff. I would highly recommend Z-Cue's!

Nice atmosphere and selection, but the advertised hours are somewhat unreliable. Supposedly open Tues - Sat from 3PM - 11PM, but I've been by when they're closed earlier or not open at all, so call ahead if you go to make sure they are actually open. Also tends to get a bit loud considering it's mainly a restaurant. If you sit outside on the patio, expect to be breathing a lot of other peoples' smoke since even though the whole area is less that 20 feet from the door, smoking is allowed. I'd recommend Pita Jungle which is less than 100 feet down the street.

I've worked with several employment agencies and this one is definitely at the bottom of the list. Initially I was excited as the company I was placed at was well known and the salary was good. However, once I started, there was no communication with me unless I initiated it. After receiving my 1st paycheck, I noticed the rate was nearly a dollar less that what I had originally been told. I spoke to my recruiter and was told that the original rate was correct and that she would get it taken care of. Eventually, she informed me that she had been mistaken and the lower rate was correct. Once the assignment ended, there was basically no more communication from RemX. I called and asked about a personal possession I'd left at the assignment and was assured that they would pick it up for me. Even though I promptly returned my badge and keys, I'm still waiting to get my possessions back. On a side note, this is the only agency where I've ever had to sign a form indicating that they will charge you for your drug screen. I don't know if that is just RemX or the whole industry is going in that direction. Frankly, I'd recommend going somewhere else.
