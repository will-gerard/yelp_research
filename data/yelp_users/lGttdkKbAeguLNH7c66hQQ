Stopped here for a bite after shopping.  Friendly staff, quick service, and reasonably priced.  We shared the bruschetta and hummus.  Then I had the chicken breast pita.  Everything tasted fresh.  The pita bread was warm and soft.  The hummus had great flavor and not drenched in extra oil.  The bruschetta was so simple and yummy, fresh tomatoes over a pesto with a sprinkle of parm on top.  It was just enough food and really hit the spot.  If I lived here I'd love to come back for another meal. I loved the open air setting, friendly service and great food.

Great experience overall.  I reserved the car through their website prior to my trip.  Once I arrived I rode the rental car shuttle to the large building with all other rental places.  The one downside was that I stood in line for 45 minutes to get my car.  They had 5 people working behind the counter and we moving as fast as they could.  If you use them make sure to sign up for Fast Break and you get to skip the line and go straight to your car.  The car was what I ordered. Simple to pick up. Friendly counter service.  Dropping off was painless and quick too.  I had no issues at all.  I choose my rentals mainly based on price, so I'm sure I'll use Budget again at some point, but I would not choose them over a cheaper competitor. They were good, but not anything above and beyond the expected.

I've only ordered off their catering menu, never actually eaten in the restaurant. So that being said up front, here are my thoughts:  Called to order 1 week prior to my work meeting.  the manager basically allowed us to customize our order to get what we wanted for the number of people.  Their catering menu is very affordable and many of the deals include rice, beans, chips and salsa...can't beat that!  And they even throw in the plates, napkins, and plastic silverware...other places you have to pay for this.  All we needed were serving utensils.   Our food was hot, fresh and exactly what we ordered.  it was ready on time too.  I'd love to go back and order off their full menu.  Their service and food were great. I'd recommend them for catering.

Stopped in here while traveling for work. The sushi sign in the window caught my eye. It's a small dining room, but the decor is nice.  The gal at the door was friendly, but my server seemed almost annoyed by me.  She did the basics, but didn't refill my water until she brought my bill.  She also didn't bother to mention their happy hour specials and brought me the special menu only after I asked.  I had the blackened chicken and shrimp with veggies.  It had a peppery teriyaki flavor.The chicken was great, but the shrimp was over cooked.  Overall it was pretty decent, but nothing super special.  I had half a california roll as my side dish and it was not so great.  It had artificial crab that just had a strange taste.  In the end I left full and satisfied, but I don't think i'd go back.

Just an incredible combination of mexican and asian food and flavors. I'll admit I really wasn't sure if I was gonna like it. But I'm so glad I tried it.  If it's you're first time, tell 'em and they'll give you several samples and explain the menu.  I loved the black beans with just a little spice.  Then I had ginger chicken and the jerk chicken.  Oh so good.  The chicken was moist and not fatty.  The ingredients were fresh and the flavors were just fantastic.  Yes the inside is a bit rough, but not dirty.  Clearly people come for the food and friendly service.  I'd have been perfectly content sitting any where as long as I got to eat the food.  Then to top it off you get a free snickerdoodle cookie...yum. I left completely stuffed, but didn't regret a single bite. In fact I want to go back again to try more tomorrow before I fly out.

My first Sprinkles experience was in Beverly Hills.  We wait 30 minutes outside before getting in.  I was happy that the wait wasn't long at all in Scottsdale.  We don't have a Sprinkles in KC so of course that justified getting 4 cupcakes to share with two other friends.  We got the coconut, black & white, red velvet and peanut butter chips.  All of them were fantastic in their own ways.  Each was moist and rich in flavor.  I loved the dark chocolate cupcake in the B&W.  The peanut butter was subtle and not over power and the chocolate butter cream frosting really complimented the cupcake.  Each was rich and I couldn't finish it all.  Unlike another reviewer, I had a great experience with the staff. One staff member answered all of my questions and gave good recommendations. Then the gal behind the register was friendly too.   I have also tried the Red Velvet mix they sell and it turned out just as great as the ones from the shop.  It was very simple and a great way to share Sprinkles with my friends in KC. I certainly recommend it to impress any house guests and when you can't get out to the bakery.

Had lunch here with a large group for work.  We got a private room.  The staff was friendly and did a great job serving during our meeting, not too distracting.  I live out of town and would love to go back again.  They have a large menu and everyone loved their food.  I did the citrus salad and subbed blackened salmon for chicken. It was wonderful and fresh.  I saw many other menu items that I would have like to try. I'd say that it has something for everyone. They roast their own chicken in house and also have a tempting dessert display.

Let's just say it's cheap for good reason.  Walked in and the lobby floor was dirty, carpet in lobby hallway and other hallways had water spots and stains.  I was concerned when I checked in, but glad to see the room was in a little better shape.    The room was decent size and had a nice size desk with free wifi.  The bathroom walls were redone, but the shower tile definitely needs to be replaced.  it was separating and the grout was gross and black in places.    I'm not real familiar with the area and needed to be in this area for work.  After driving around and seeing a group of teens mingling, drinking, and smoking out by the pool, I was kinda concerned.  As a young female staying alone, I didn't exactly feel safe in the dark parking lot.  To top it off there was a high pitched beeping that persisted for at least three hours.  I called housekeeping and they sent someone out, but they were useless.  I'm supposed to be here two more nights, but will probably go some where else.

Now I must update and say that I went to the front desk with full intentions to check out and not complete my stay.  The manager suggested I move to the other side of the hotel that had be renovated and was no where near the noisy pool area.  This made a tremendous difference.  The room was much better, however I still don't get why they re did the entire bathroom except for the shower tiles and fixtures.  They are just old and don't look good and it down grades the whole bathroom.  I still would not recommend this hotel and would not stay again.  There are some many other choices. I'd simply pay a bit more and go there.  But this place did work and I was happier once I got a different room.
