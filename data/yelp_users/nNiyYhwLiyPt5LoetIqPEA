Came here yesterday with my boyfriend for our 1 year anniversary/valentines day. Made reservations for 6:30 but arrived early to grab cocktails at the Onyx Bar & sat outside in the patio area watching the sunset...it was very beautiful & romantic. Afterwards we were seated outside in the patio area of the restaurant right next to the fireplace facing the mountain view. Again it was a very beautiful & romantic ambience.   We started our dinner with complimentary warm hot dinner rolls that were super yummy & addicting. They were freshly baked & were so soft that it melted in your mouth. They were topped poppy seeds & came with butter topped with Hawaiian sea salt...so good! Next we shared a beet, pear, arugula & candied pecan salad. For entrees we had the sea bass topped with braised short rib on a bed of potato risotto and the "cow of the week" which was waygu beef with risotto & foie gras. We also ordered the lobster Mac & cheese (it was decent but not memorable). We were pleased with our dinner & it ended with complimentary chocolate covered cheesecake bites. They also gave us a small box of truffles as a gift for our anniversary. Overall the service & staffs were great. We had a wonderful & beautiful time here at Talavera & would recommend it to others.

Recently came here on a double date with another couple & this place is one of our favorite fox concept restaurants.  It's our "must-go" place for dinner whenever our friend visits from out of town. We come here quite often that we routinely order our "usuals".  Our couple friend always gets the spaghetti & meatballs which our friend claims "is the best spaghetti & meatballs ever", margherita pizza and the gluten free bolognese pasta. As for my boyfriend & I, we usually share the "pig" pizza & Italian farm salad. Oh and of course, to complete our amazing meal, us four will share a pitcher of their delicious & refreshing red sangria.  I'm usually not a fan of red wines but this is one that I love.   So if you haven't tried this place...definitely DO!!! It's a great place to hang out with friends or a nice date.  And did I forget to mention that they have happy hour all day Sunday!!!...can't beat that.

Love coming here for brunch. When the weather is nice, I love to come here and sit in the patio. Everything on the brunch menu is $10 and it comes with a beer or a mimosa...can't beat that deal! My favorite dishes are the green chili breakfast burrito or the churrasco steak & egg. I used to always get their breakfast flatbread but they changed their flatbread few months ago to this much thicker cracker crust that my friends and I are not a fan of...please bring back the old flatbread crust!...it was so thin, crispy & yummy! Anyways, cool thing about this place is it's bike & dog friendly!

Recently came here for dinner because I received an email from upward projects for a free pizza from Federal Pizza. Upward projects generally has cool concept restaurants with good food so we decided to try it out.  The restaurant is located across from Windsor, another upward project restaurant, and like all of them, it has a cool, hip vibe with a cute little patio.   As for the food, we tried the "big star" pizza & the "tlc" salad. I gotta say...food was great! The big star pizza is a wood fired pizza with a yummy combo of toppings...sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms & olives...I can see why they call it the " big star". And the salad was a nice refreshing blend of arugula, spring greens, beets, pears, almonds, fennel and cheese all tossed in a light citrus shallot vinaigrette...yum!   So if you've been to the other upward project restaurants & like them, this will be another one you will like too :)

My boyfriend and I like coming here for happy hour sushi. They have happy hour everyday for 3-6 and reverse happy hour from 10pm-close.  First off, the restaurant has a cool, hip vibe with good music playing in the background. As for the food, the sushi is consistently good and fresh.  Our 2 favorite rolls are the "lollipop" roll and "surfer" roll which are both on the happy hour menu. The lollipop roll is a cucumber wrapped roll with tuna and the surfer roll is topped with shrimp dynamite.  Besides the good sushi, this place has great service. Everything from our two servers, Aaron and Will, going above and beyond to ensure that we were well taken care of, to the manager periodically checking up on us as well. Very personable and knowledgeable of the menu. These are reasons why we continue to come back for happy hour sushi.

Came here for the first time today with my boyfriend & we have to say...this is probably one of our new favorite brunch spots. First off, wait is ridiculous. We arrived around 11:00am & wait was about 60-75 mins for 2 people...crazy! We put our name down & went on some errands. They'll text you 5 mins before your table is ready. I got the text, checked in & for some reason waited an additional 20 mins. Apparently they forgot about us so we asked to be seated at the bar. To make up for the wait they gave us a free giant caramel apple pie pancake...it was insanely yummy. I'm not a fan of Apple pie but I would order this pancake again. For cocktails we ordered the spicy Bloody Mary (with habanero & jalepeno infused vodka) & spicy gazpacho Bloody Mary (with cucumber, garlic & bell pepper infused vodka). Both were delicious! As for food, we ordered the chilaquiles Benedict & Bella Bella Benny Benedict (with proscuitto, arugula & balsamic glaze). Food & flavors were incredible! Everything on their food & drink menus are unique & there's a good variety of brunch items. The girls at the bars were super nice & attentive and the restaurant has a cool, hip, trendy vibe/atmosphere. Would definitely come back to try other brunch items & would recommend it to our friends...just have to keep in mind of the crazy wait time.

Went here for the first time with my boyfriend this past Friday night for dinner. First impression...it's a small restaurant with a cool, hip ambience...a good place for a date or a small group. For drinks we ordered the rosemary baby & cilantro mule. Both cocktails were delicious, interesting & creative. As for food, we ordered the vongole (a white pizza with bacon & clams) and the chicken Marsala (with a grand marnier reduction).  Food was phenomenal & flavors were on point.  Service & staff were excellent & attentive. Met with the owner Taygen, very friendly & cool & checked up on us few times to ensure we were happy with everything. Definitely would come back again to try their other unique dishes.

Decided to try this place out with my boyfriend on Cinco de mayo since they were offering $2 carnitas tacos all day. Like all upward project restaurants, it has very cool, hip vibe with a decent size patio...definitely looked like a cool hangout spot to grab drinks with friends. Unfortunately I will not be returning as the food was nothing impressive & service was terrible. The only thing we did like was the complimentary chips & salsa. The tortilla chips were thin & crispy & the salsa was a nice, fresh roasted tomato salsa. So we tried the carnitas tacos...it was decent but nothing I would come back for. I've had way better street tacos elsewhere like Los Taquitos.  So If you're looking for authentic tacos, this is not the place.  As for the terrible service, maybe they were short staffed or that it was cinco de mayo but we came around 9:30-10:00pm (late dinner) and the restaurant was not that packed but a simple "sorry we're short staffed but we'll do our best to attend to your needs" would have sufficed & we could have forgiven them for their slow service, not refilling our water or the fact they constantly walked pass our table without acknowledging us.  Will not be coming back & definitely will not recommend this place to our friends.
