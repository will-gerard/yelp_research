These people were so unbelievably rude to me. They were rude on the phone, they were rude when I picked my order up. I am not going back even though the food was good, not worth being treated like you are the smallest person in the world. There are a handful of other deli very very close that are just as good.  Update: 11/22/14 I just saw your truck driving down 7th Street in the most reckless dangerous way. Wow, if you're going to drive like a jerk, word of advice, don't vinyl wrap your truck with your business on it!

Best chicken fried steak, chicken fried chicken, steak fries, biscuits, rolls, coleslaw, desserts, ice cold Shiner Bock, crafted cocktails, need I say more? My husband and I can split a chicken fried steak dinner, and still have some for breakfast the next day! I'd say that's worth the $17 a plate price, for 3 meals. Parking can get a little crazy, try going for happy hour during the week before 6 for dinner. You will get $2.25 bottles of Shiner Bock and a parking space! If you do go and can't find a spot to park, don't give up, the food is worth the walk. This place is also super family friendly. There is just enough noise for you parents with younger ones to not feel bad if the kiddo gets noisy. Their kid's menus are Armadillos that you can color, cut out, and fold to make 3-D. The friendly host was telling the kids jokes, and asking Texas trivia questions. Adults without kids, not to worry, there's a nice comfy bar stool waiting for you in the back!

Let me start by saying this place is 24 hours! Skip Denny's and go here, the food is soooo much better.  I love their first Friday's every month with live rockabilly, or country, or 50's era inspired bands. There is such a mix of ages there dancing and hula hooping it is a blast! My daughter is 5 and loves going to listen to the music, dance, and hula hoop. People drive their classic cars out, I've even seen a vintage trailer there. (The Scottsdale location does this on the 3rd Friday of the month too.)   The staff here is always super nice and friendly. I have always had the best service. For a date night try splitting the turkey club sandwich (this sandwich is huge btw) and a milkshake, it will fill you both up and only cost you about $15! For the kids they are served their meal in a cool classic car (my daughter has started to collect them she likes them so much).

This is the worst Danny's I have ever been to. Whoever runs this location should be ashamed of yourself. I have been to the other locations and NEVER had the experience I had here. I even heard other people complaining while I was in there. I would've rather waited an extra 15 minutes to actually get my car washed.....there was dust, yes dust not dirt or grime or something hard to get off, still on my steering wheel and radio. The back of the car wasn't even vacuumed out. I paid for a works, there was no air freshener in my car. On top of not getting the car wash I paid for they stole my   auxiliary cord. When I called they asked if I saw someone steal it? Of course not they are inside my car and I'm sitting on the sidelines, it's not like I'm standing over my car watching their every move. They told me they would keep and eye out for it......

This is the perfect neighborhood bar. I've been here almost every day of the week, and there is always something going on. Between the multiple TVs and the huge projection screen for sports events, to dance lessons, and plenty of live music all week you can get your fill in more ways than one at this bar.   They get nationally and world famous touring bands, and of course our favorite local bands to play, always keeping it entertaining. Every Thursday night is rockabilly night, if you've never been for this music it's a true treat with pinups, greasers, cars, motorcycles, swing dancers, and of course an amazing band to tap your feet to, all with no cover! This is the highlight of my week, but they also offer a wide variety of different musicians from rock, to metal, country, blues, and some great cover bands as well!  The bartenders are hard to ignore here. They will pour your drink strong and fast, with fire and grace. They also have one of the best bar backs I've ever seen. If something breaks he's there in a split second, and watch out for him carrying around about 15 glasses stacked at a time. It's always clean, even the restrooms! Which says A LOT about this "dive" bar.  If you're in the area don't skip out on going to The Blooze. There's sure to be something going on, and hey, if all is quiet, just have some drinks and play some pool or darts.

I wanted to go play some mini golf and basically had 3 options close to me. A childhood memory of playing mini golf here made me want to check it out again since I hadn't been here in probably around 15 years. I had heard of this place as getting dirty and "ghetto" from other people so I was a little reluctant.  To my surprise it was clean, I felt safe, there were lots of families there, and there were lots of other couples out for a date night playing mini golf. We had a blast, the courses were just as cool as I had remembered them being, and it was a great night out doing something different then the normal dinner and a movie date night. There were surprisingly a lot of 20's-30's couples playing on the course, in fact that was mostly all I saw playing mini golf.  After mini golf we played some games in the arcade. There was a photo booth to capture our night which I LOVE! I also won a giant soccer ball out of the giant claw machine!  If you're looking for something fun to do, skip Scottsdale, and go to Castles N' Coasters to play some rounds of mini golf and challenge your honey to a game of giant Connect Four!

This is a special place for the kids, if you want them to be entertained and not worry if they get a little loud and excited about something this is a great place to take them. The food is nothing special (think theme park quality and prices), but it really is a one of a kind place. The pressed penny machines are always a cool and cheap, $.51, souvenir, that should help you getting around spending money in the attached gift shop. They have a full bar, and the kids can get a kid friendly frozen drink in a special cup. Kids meals are about $6-$7, adults range from $15, for soup and salad combo, to $22-$30 for fish or seafood. I wouldn't go here for the food, but go for that look on yours kid's faces and the cool parent/grandparent title for taking them there!

Their gelato is always dressed up and is so pretty looking it's almost a shame to be the first one to get a scoop (almost). I love the flavors and variety here. The staff seems to always be willing to help (I guess as much as any teenager with a minimum wage, part time job). But really the employees are friendly and helpful and do a great job getting me my gelato fix fast. I love that they have self serve water on the counter, this is such a good idea for anywhere in Phoenix! Good job Gelato Spot I will continue to be a repeat customer.

I love my little gym. There's no fuss, all of the equipment works well. I always seem to be able to get on to the machines I want without waiting. (Except maybe the bench press as it seems like that's where the meat heads like to stay for the whole 30-40 mins I'm there, like THE WHOLE TIME.) Any who, the staff is friendly, fast checking in, like I said no fuss. Oh and they have this cool circuit workout setup, for a well rounded 20 minute workout. All of the machines are green instead of purple, and you watch the stop light on the wall and do your thing. I enjoy my $20/month to be able to bring whoever I want, and go to any location I want.
