I called four times last night to place a to-go order (7:30p-8p) and got their recording each time.  Either this place is SO busy they can't get to the phone or they had closed up early and went home.    I'm still craving Thai...and looking for a great place in Central Phoenix.  Any other suggestions or should I give this place another chance?

Who puts celery in chili?  No french fries?  Carrot and raisin salad on the menu?  Cute old-fashioned decor, but really I just wanted to dust the place.

Love, love, love AJ's!!! It will be my go-to place for hard to find items and for when I feel like really treating myself.   The deli dinner we got a few weeks ago was great. Chicken was moist and flavorful and the pasta salad was very tasty. The cannolis from the dessert case were fabulous.   Great wine, floral, meat, and produce sections too.   I didn't think I would find a replacement for Huckleberries Natural Market in Spokane. Well, Hucks, you've been replaced!

Celebrating a co-worker's birthday in the conference room is never a fun thing to do..even when it is getting you away from your desk for 10 minutes. Well, a few weeks back that all changed. Roxy got a chocolate and champagne cake and cinnamon rolls, just because she was craving them at 3:00pm. Well, always a white cake girl, I tried the champagne cake and omg!!!!! It is the BEST cake I have ever had! It's rich, but not too rich. Creamy and buttery and oh so good. I needed to get Nico's uncle a birthday cake on Monday and just HAD to get us a champagne cake. I sent have of the leftovers home with Johnny and I single handedly finished the rest over two days. Maybe they make single portion sizes? Oh why lie, I can eat a whole cake in a few days!

Today was the first time I've tried the AJ's salad bar.  Hey Yelp, I'm a fan!  Fresh, high quality items and my salad was dee-lish.  But I made it myself...so how could it not be?  $4.89 for my salad and I'm a full happy camper.  Minus one star for having too big for me chicken chunks.

This was my 3rd choice for lunch yesterday with my coworkers and I'm really glad we ended up going here! I hadn't heard any fantastic about this place, but nothing horrible either.   I had the lunch special with 1/2 sandwich and salad for around $7.00. I got the #7 sandwich which has three different Italian meats, cheese, lettuce, tomato, peppercinis, and a oil type sauce. It was awesome! The bread was toasted and the perfect combination of crunchy and soft. The Caesar was pretty standard, but tasty none the less.   This place is close to work and I'm sure we'll be back sometime soon.

I was very nervous to try a salon in Phoenix. I'm not sure if it's the cost of maintaining ones hair in a large city or trying a new stylist that frightened me more. I was getting a pedicure next door at V-K Elle Nails when a woman asked another woman where she got her hair done. She did have super cute hair and when she stated "next door at Salon Estique" I was excited to check them out after my pedi.   The salon was busy even at 12:30p on a Monday. The gal at the front desk was friendly and helped me book an appointment for the next day. She also gave me a $20 off coupon for being a first time client. I scheduled a color with Meg and I was briefed on Meg's prices. $70 for an all over color and $80 for highlights. The end result was me needing both an all over color AND highlights, so at $150 I was glad I had that $20 off coupon. It will take some getting used to paying this for color in Phoenix.   If that was the negative, then everything else was a positive. Meg was very friendly and walked me through what she was going to do as well as why she needed to do the all over color to correct the red that I badly wanted gone. She assured me that next time I would need to only do the highlights.   My whole experience was a good one at Salon Estique- clean, semi-trendy atmosphere, professional staff, top notch service, and a great end result. My hair turned out beautiful and I got a few compliments that night. I plan to return in February for my next visit.

After some time away and a bad haircut (somewhere else), I returned to Salon Estique for an up-do on my 30th birthday. I was not happy with a sylist's work, but that person has since left.  I was not planning on getting my hair done and at the last minute said, "self, you're only 30 once, splurge and get your hair did!". So I got in with Hollis, a very nice stylist there. She listened to what I was wanting and produced a fabulous look for my big night. My style was $50, which I felt was a little steep, considering that I really don't have much hair. Regardless, I looked and felt great all night long.   Since February, I've returned to Hollis for my cuts and color. She is very friendly and is easy to talk to. And not just about what I want with my hair. She has many years of experience and I feel like I can really trust her.   The salon itself is nice enough. Well laid out and friendly staff, without being too trendy and making you feel out of place. They offered me wine while sitting under the dryer once or twice, but not every time I'm there. They also stand by their services and if you are not happy, they will do it again until you are happy, free of charge. I experienced this when I wasn't completely happy with a cut. Hollis trimmed a bit more off the back and I was a happy camper.   The only complaint I have is that they seem to book their stylists a bit tight and one or two other (typically very young) girls will assist while my stylist is off helping someone else. If I am paying top dollar for my services, I should be getting experienced professionals adding color to my hair. Shampooing is one thing, I understand that, but I prefer one person to perform my actual service. (cut, color)   All in all, I enjoy my experience and end results each time at Salon Estique. I would recommend them to anyone who lives in this area. Ten minutes from my home is just an added perk!

The first time I experienced The Eggery was for a business lunch in their back meeting room. As I walked through the restaurant, I was surprised it was so busy...I mean this IS a breakfast place, right?   The decor is very outdated with knick knack cutter EVERYWHERE. I am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants. I can see why old people love this place.   I ordered the taco salad for my lunch. What a disappointment! Almost bad iceberg lettuce, a sprinkling of all other toppings. No beans, so if you want any protein you have to pay $2.00 extra to add chicken. This salad was not worth $8.95. With a $3 iced tea and a 20% added tip to the bill, I got out of there for $14.00. I will pay $14.00 for a weekday lunch, but only if it is a nicer place with top notch service and food.   Yesterday I went to the Eggery again with Nico and his Grandma after church. Maybe my mindset was a bit different since we were there for brunch. Same awful decor, but it seemed a bit more charming at 10:30am.   I had the Berry Blintz Crepes which were pretty good. Stuffed inside was blueberry yogurt, mixed berries, cottage cheese, and a little bit of cream cheese. Whipped cream, toasted pecans and a berry sauce were on top of the rolled crepes. It seemed like a lot of food for $7.50, a much better value than my crappy overpriced salad.   I am not in any hurry to return to the Eggery, although my business group meets there every week. Nico did point out that I have been here twice now and have yet to actually try any EGG dish. Maybe next time...

Still trying to find my go-to noodle bowl place after visiting Yoshi's. This place looked dive-ish, but some of the best dishes come from places that look just like this. We went through the drive-thru around 8pm last Wednesday. The inside looked closed as the chairs were all stacked on the tables, but the drive-thru was buzzing.   My friend and I both got the Yakisoba noodle bowl with chicken. I also ordered an order of Gyoza. Both bowls and Gyoza came to $11.00 with tax. Pretty decent prices I thought.   We got back to my house, opened up the white wine, and camped out on the couch with our dinners. The sauce was pretty good- kind of a citrus soy. The noodles were good, even if average. Veggies and chicken were okay too. I guess the whole bowl was just okay. I was really craving the noodles and it shouldn't be hard to make good noodles at a Noodle place. The Gyoza were alright too- kind of crunchy around the edges. The sauce served with them were good though.   All in all, not my dream dinner, but just okay. Would probably drive-thru again if I was in the area and didn't feel like cooking that night.

This DQ is getting a face lift and it looks like they're almost done with the remodel.    The good: DQ now offers a "Mini" size which is PERFECT for my periodic Half Health Bar, Half Oreo Blizzard cravings.  The bad: The Drive Thru takes FOREVER!!  Seriously, I don't know what is happening inside when there are only 2 cars in the parking lot?!  The ugly: The damage those Blizzards are doing to my heart and ass

I went to Central Shoe Repair because my normal shoe guy on 19th Ave did not have the correct color of tan for new heels on my favorite Michael Kors beauties.  "No, black will not work", I explained to him.  Nerrick replaced the heel tips, as well as resoled my Cognac colored friends.  In total: $40, which seemed a bit pricey, but they do look near new again.   I would use Nerrick again.  Great location for me and I've never met a more friendly Cobbler.  *FYI: Nerrick's wife does alterations out of the same shop.

I stopped by Hinkley's yesterday to look for a light for our bathroom remodel. I've also been eying the very cool paper star lights they hang in their windows as I drive past on my way to work each day.   I was in the place 15 minutes and was not greeted once. There seemed to be only one gal working at the time (with a customer), but not even a "Hi there!"   The shop has BEAUTIFUL lights, but the $650 one I loved is a bit out of my price range. Ok, WAY out of my price range. Even the paper stars were $30-40. Boo.   Maybe there's a pocket of richies in Central Phoenix that can afford Hinkley's...but even if I could, I am turned off to shop here again....a simple "hello" would have been nice.

Not impressed. When I ordered the Oyako bowl, the conversation went something like this:  Me: What type of sauce comes on the Oyako bowl?  Female employee: Chicken  Me: Yes, I know it has chicken in it, but what type of sauce comes on the chicken and rice?  Female employee: Chicken sauce  Nico: Just order it Teresa  Me: Ok, can you substitute noodles for rice, please?  Female employee: Puzzled look of total confusion  Me: Repeated the above question  Female employee: Uhhh, no, no substitute for noodles  Nico: This is not the time to be picky Teresa  Me: Fine (as I'm looking at the sign that states "Substitute noodles for rice for $0.80)   Now I can see why the employee was so confused. There was NO sauce in my rice bowl. It was just chicken, rice, egg, and green onions. I had to add soy when we got home and I am not a huge fan of soy. Nico raves about this place and he very much enjoyed his Teriyaki rice bowl. I will go again and try something else, and I will probably make him order for me.

Upscale thrift store?  Seems like an oxy moron to me, but whatever.  I purchased 6 items:  * 2 dresses, both still with tags on them * 2 pairs of shorts * 2 tank/halter tops, one was BCBG Max Azria  All for $80.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  I love that you can bring in your gently used clothes and sell or get store credit.  I'm a fan!

I love CJ Talley's!  For the cheap drinks, friendly staff, decent food, local crowd, stellar juke box and for a small dive-ish bar, it's clean and well taken care of.  CJ is a great owner who actually mingles with his patrons.  He's a younger duder who loves what he does.  The tacos and chili dogs are very good.  Yes, I said chili dogs.  When you get sick of paying the Vig Uptown's prices, come across the street and you'll be pleasantly surprised.

After much too long away from Yelp, I'm so tickled to have PCG as my first review back!   I LOVE this sister restaurant to Sierra Bonita. The atmosphere is dark and cozy with a SW flair. Always friendly servers who know Nico's family from way back...but I am certain they are this nice and prompt with everyone.   I've been 3-4 times now and I can honestly say that the Pork Tenderloin with corn & goat cheese cakes was THE best pork dish I have ever had. It was AMAZING! We went once just for appetizers and they were all so darn good. The Brie dish in particular was divine.   For a special night out or just drinks in the bar (hopefully Frank is working when you go), you will not be disappointed!

My new favorite dish at PCG (actually anywhere) is the new Surf N Turf Pasta entree. It is freakin' amazing! Cooked to order medallions of beef (I believe its filet) and HUGE prawns over a bed of fettuccine noodles. Seasoned with diced green chilies, corn, and a bit of cheese, it's"s a bit spicy, but over all just so dang tasty.   I also have recently tried their Dreamy Draw Chili and it is a winner. Made of pinto beans, it's"s different from your traditional red sauce chili.   I honestly have not had a bad dish at PCG. Kim is the best server they have, but maybe we're biased because we know her. If you still have not tried PCG, make it a point to do so soon. I hear their parking lot remodel is completed. :)

After sneaking in to the Biltmore to use their hot tub for 2 hours, we needed a place to grab some food and a drink or two. Of course, it was more for me that we needed a dive-y sort of place as I had no makeup and a baseball hat covering my wet hair. Nico recommended Armadillo's and I was a fan right away. We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and prompt with our drinks.   We ordered:  *Wings in Armadillo Gold Sauce- Nico loved them  *Potato Skins- soooo good! Some of the best skins I've ever had  *Hummus and Pita bread- also v good. Pita was warm and toasted perfectly   There were a lot of sports fans glued to the Chargers game and it was a fun atmosphere.  Definatly a place to stop in for cheap food and drinks, with or without looking like a complete scrub.

Only went to the downstairs bar, but cannot wait to return!  Very cool with the rock and copper features and leather couches.  We sat at the bar and were served drinks that you pour yourself.  Is this a new trend?  He gave us little glass bottles of tonic and coke with little spoons to stir our drinks with.  Those little spoons were so cute I was almost tempted to put them in my purse.  If another couple hadn't been hogging the fireplace the whole time, we would have sat there.  Maybe next time.  We'll try to food too.

I have been to Houston's several times now, but always for lunch. It's always been on my company's or boyfriend's dime. To me, it's more than what I like to pay for a lunch. But the atmosphere is very nice and the servers are among the best in the city.   But the food is amazing. The prime rib french dip is divine and I get it almost every time. The fries are delicious and I over eat and plan on doing so when I go.   Overall, a beautiful place for a business lunch, date, or place to grab a drink and app before a movie.

Two other women chose LGO for a business lunch last week. I was expecting something completely different. I showed up around 11:45am on a Wednesday and the place was PACKED. I had to park across the street.  The grocery area is where you order lunch. It was shoulder to shoulder with other patrons, most professionally dressed. I don't really see the appeal of coming here on your lunch hour squeezed in with everyone else.   I chose a Caesar salad from the case as I was in line. I asked the girl at the counter if I could add chicken to the salad and was told she had turkey breast. But it was sliced, lunch meat style turkey. "No thanks" I told her. I would have thought they would carry grilled meat to add to the salads.   Now to find a table..ugh. I snagged one as a group was leaving, I felt like a lurker. So we are there to chat with our client and eventually talk business. The techno music was so loud, I could barely hear myself or my client. Gosh, I feel like a Grandma here, but it was just not a conducive place to have a business lunch.   Props do need to go to the dessert case.  That thing was packed with amazing treats, some from Tammie Coe.  I had a mini cupcake, a white cake with a cream cheese frosting with shredded coconut on top.  It was AMAZING!  I would give LGO another chance, possibly for the pizza everyone says is so fabulous. The manager contacted me the day I went to LGO. I had sent a fellow Yelper a comment about his experience at LGO (similar to mine). She must have seen my comment and was trying to intervene before I wrote my review. I find this in poor taste. As if contacting me prior to my review will change my mind about my experience there? Sorry, no.   So many people have raved to me about LGO, maybe I went in with too high of expectations?

Went on a 'Stay-cation' getaway with Nico this past weekend at the Scottsdale Links Resort. We had a wonderful time here!   The check-in process was quick and painless. Staff was very friendly and helpful, plus it's fun pretending you don't know where the closest super market, Starbucks, and bars are. Technically, we really weren't sure as we rarely come up to North Scottsdale.   The one bedroom condo was perfect for us. I'm fairly certain this complex used to be apartments or owned condos. It was very roomy, had nice furnishings, and was CLEAN...which is always important. I'm not sure if the last reviewer was having a bad day or just a big snob, but we felt the condo was nice enough for what we were looking for. All the amenities of home, plus a workout center and nice pool.   Speaking of the pool, as some reviews I read online claimed the pool was very small. It wasn't super small, but it wasn't huge either. There was always plenty of room in the pool and on the pool deck. We even brought in our cooler of adult beverages and nobody bothered us about it. Nice chairs to lounge in and very close to the fitness center where the restrooms were.   This was the second time we've used our vacation club (time share) and this place was much nicer than the unit we had in Hilton Head, SC. I would recommend this property to anyone who has a car (it isn't close to anything walking distance), interested in being in North Scottsdale, and isn't looking for the Ritz Carlton-ish accommodations.

"Nobody leaves this place without singin' the Blues."  I felt nothing like Chris Parker when I set foot in Char's.  Let's just say I did not have the 'Babysitting Blues'.  The way pimped-out Doorman/Cashier was so friendly and shook Nico's hand as we entered.    This. Place. Rocks.   That is all I really need to say, but I will elaborate a bit.  I had read several Yelp reviews before going and was totally pumped.  I thought maybe I was setting myself up for disappointment believing all the great reviews.  Not a chance.  Char's was so amazing!  The band Soul Power rocked the house and we danced our butts off.  The crowd, staff, band...everyone... were clearly from all different walks of life/backgrounds and yet meshed and made the place even cooler.   We took a breather on the covered patio which does NOT leak when raining as someone pondered in another review.    This is my new favorite hot spot in Central Phoenix.  I could go on and on, but quit reading this review and just get to Char's!!

I've been using Regal for almost a year now and have only had one problem and that is why I'm compelled to write a review.   They shredded the light silk-like material off of my brand new cardigan. I still had the receipt and the owner, Dave, was very nice about paying for my sweater.   Very reasonable prices for dry cleaning and laundry. A bonus for me is the location..two buildings down from my office. Sweet.

This is my home-base Einstein's..or is it Noah's Bagels?  Same thing really.  I was delighted to learn Phoenix has Noah's sister company, Einstein Bros Bagels, upon moving here.  My favorite is the 6 cheese bagel, but I'm branching out more and more and trying other flavors.  Minus one star for running out of my beloved 6 cheese from time to time and I sitll have a hard time paying $5 for a bagel, cream cheese (I refuse to use that awful 'S' word they use), and juice.

This place keeps getting more and more ghetto! I will not, repeat will NOT visit this store after dark by myself. Hire a security officer already!   Not only does the clientele leave something to be desired, the selection is awful! I will drive to Safeway on 7th St and Glendale (at least 8 more minutes away from my house) just to not have to visit this store. It's a shame that the closest large grocer to my home is so horrible. 15th Ave and Northern is a really nice area, yet the closest super market is awful. I just don't get it?!

This is my go-to place for a Margarita and good Mexi food within biking/walking distance.   What we love:   Fresh chips and salsa, and the bean dip served with is dee-lish   BIG, CHEAP Margs. Try the Mango, Peach, Mango/Peach. :)   Fish Tacos. I had never had them before and they were very good. On Wednesdays they are only $0.99!   Great enchiladas, cheese crisps, and pork tacos as well   Friendly service. The servers are always impressed (or act that way) when Nico uses his Spanish on them.   It's nothing fancy or will win any interior decor awards, but we love coming here for a fun experience and always get out of there without spending a ton of dough. Muy bien!

Went with a group of about 10 and had a great time.  Service was pretty good, restrooms were clean and well stocked (yes, this is always something I consider while reviewing), and the heaters were working perfectly.    One funny thing was that my friend ordered a round of shots for the group and the chick taking his order says "What is that?  What's in it?" and he states "Just tell the Bartender, they'll know".  In a rude tone with a rude face she says, "I am the Bartender."  Go look it up then sweetie.  All in all, a fun night with friends at one of the cooler Scottsdale bars I've been to.

There's not much to be said that hasn't been said about the Christmas decor. I found it hilarious. So much to see on top of the great people watching. I found the Coach House refreshingly tacky and delightful. The drinks were cheap, even if you had to wait 20 minutes pushing your way through the crowd to get them. The lines to the bathroom were horrible. I believe there was only one stall in the ladies room. I cannot get over the fact that I can hang outside on a patio bar in December, it's something I can get used to though. I love this town!

Jules was our server a few Wednesdays back for Lon's Wine Wednesday. We each got 4 tastes of Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand (2) and Australia (2). They were generous pours and I definitely got my $12 worth.  Jules was friendly and attentive and kept track of which girl was on which wine.   We tried Lon's food special- three appetizers for $15. A seemingly good deal, but the portions are quite small. But there was enough for each girl to have a nibble of each item.   Lon's is a fun place for girlfriends to meet or a date with your honey. It would also be great to take my parents to next time they're in town. The patio is quite beautiful and I cannot wait for the weather to cool down to enjoy some wine out there.

Even while sitting in the VERY last row of the auditorium, I had a lovely view and could hear the performance well. (Minus poor Gaston's mic issues on opening night of Beauty and the Beast.)   The interior and exterior are nice enough and I like the retro feel of the place. Parking is decent and leaving after the performance was pretty painless.   Minus one star for the terrible Ladies Room situation. Why do planners over look this issue in so many public places? When a girl has to go, a girl has to go! Add more stalls, Gammage...please!

What a disappointment! Here are my Cons for last evening's dinner:   -Over cooked Egg rolls  -Server could barely speak English  -Will not let you get half-and-half anything. I wanted half Almond Chicken, half Sweet and Sour Chicken, wouldn't allow so I chose Sweet and Sour- this was 2 out of 5 stars.  -Entrees only came with white rice, we had to order a plate of Pork Fried Rice for $4.95 extra, which was greasy and not too tasty  -Kung Pao Chicken had maybe 3 peanuts on the whole plate   Sadly, I would rather go to PF Changs next time. Our $80 (we ordered a bottle of yucky Chardonnay) would be better spent somewhere that at least attempts to accommodate our requests.

Cibo! Cibo! Cibo!  I love you and your cute old farm house, your amazing pizza, affordable wine, awesome crepe desserts, and fabulous staff!  I want to live in the apartment above the restaurant!!   Go to Cibo for awesome food, charming atmosphere, and a great time for a girls night or on a date.  Cibo has quickly become my favorite place in Phoenix!   *They're closed on Sundays...found this out the hard way.

I LOVE Sierra Bonita! Here is my list of reasons to love this place:   1. Happy Hour- 1/2 off apps and awesome drink specials   2.  Mini Quesadillas. I am addicted to these things!! I had never had huitlacoche (a fungus that grows on ears of corn) until now. Try them, you will not be disappointed! The bacon wrapped shrimp are awesome as well. Honestly, there is nothing that I have had here that I did not like.   3. Great drinks! The sangria is very tasty and Kenny's margaritas are the among the best I've ever had.   4. Fabulous patio complete with cozy fireplace. I wish I could open my slider door and walk out to this everyday. The inside is dimly lit and intimate; great for a date night or an evening with friends.   5. The hottest server in the Valley works there- Kelton!  If you show up and Kelton is not working, leave immediately!!  I say this with a disclaimer- the absolute hottest server, my Nico, did work there, but sadly for many Valley women, quit some time ago.  So Kelton, the title now belongs to you my friend.  6.  The service is supreme!  When we aren't honored with Kelton's presence, we are treated to great service by Julie, Kenny, Nate and all the other great  peeps at SB.  We frequent Sierra Bonita almost weekly and for good reasons.  If you have wanted to try it and haven't, I encourage you to go this weekend!  This place will soon be your home away from home...it's certainly ours!

Rosie's was the very first bar my bf took me to in Phx back in September. Actually, it was 9/11. We stopped in for a drink around 6pm-ish and there were candles lit everywhere and lots of American flags hung up. They were remembering victims of 9/11 and we showed up right before the bagpipers started playing. My high school mascot was a Highlander, so bagpipers will always hold a special place in my heart. It was really moving hearing them play "Amazing Grace" along with a few other songs. After the music, the owner read a poem and had a moment of silence for the fallen victims. After the memorial, it was business as usual and there seemed to be a growing crowd by the time we left.   We also stopped by for a drink with an out of town friend last night. Both guys commented how cool the place is and declared their love for Irish beer. The service has been great both visits, last night I believe Rosie herself was waiting on us. I could be wrong, but with her cute accent and cheery disposition, she seemed like a 'Rosie' to me.

I'm the newest fan of Ticoz after trying it last week for the first time. Myself and two wonderful ladies...shout out to Dottsy Z!..hit up happy hour on a beautiful Wednesday evening. Only happy hour turned into happy HOURS!   Things I loved:  *the over all vibe and styling of the place. Great decor and great hint of Spanish flair without over doing it.  *the food was excellent. I had some chips and salsa which were pretty standard. The tacos, although, were outstanding. I had one chicken and one beef. The beef was AWESOME! I am trying to eat red meat only two times per week and I may just have to have both meals be these tacos!  *The service was great as well. I've heard people say this place is "gay friendly". This day and age, "friendly" anything is wonderful. But seriously, our server/bartender was very knowledgeable, friendly, and prompt.   I can't wait to head back to dine on the patio and explore the menu more!

This was my first hike in Phoenix, actually Arizona for that matter. It was the perfect December afternoon, mid 70's; a far cry from the low 30's in Washington! We found a parking spot, did a few stretches, and got going. It was fairly busy with hikers, but everyone was very polite/friendly if you needed to pass someone or while waiting to let a downward hiker by. The views were amazing and pictures from the top are worth framing. I was a hiking virgin, but I think this place was awesome! I think I'm ready to conquer Camelback now!

Have you ever seen that SNL skit with Chris Farley and Adam Sandler where they house sit and the dumpy, empty pool transforms into a tropical paradise complete with oodles of hot, gay men? That is what Nico and I had walked into. Now I hope this does not come off as offensive to any gay person reading this. I think that skit is hilarious no matter who you are. And Sandler and Farley are true comic gems. http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&VideoID=31956578   I did not realize that we came to lounge by the pool on the last day of the Phoenix Gay Pride weekend. Not that there is anything wrong with that. I wanted to have a splash fight with all the hot guys. To be fair, Nico enjoyed the lovely ladies too.   I loved the decor inside and pool side. Vibrant colors and just a cool, hip vibe to the place. The entrance plastic banner was a little unexpected, but it's clear to see they are in the middle of some upgrades. I'm sure they will have a trendy-looking, bright sign up in no time.   We lounged and had a few drinks before I spilled half of my awesome Lemon Drop on the pool deck. The female bartender said it was a secret recipe. It hit the spot in the hot sun.   After pool time, we headed up to the roof top bar to check things out. It was about 5pm and a staffer was setting up for the evening. The views were great and we took a few photos with the skyline in the background. I could see this place would be a blast at night.   I'm looking forward to heading back soon. I see on their website that the restaurant is open. A girlfriend and I may actually go today after work. I'm craving a Lemon Drop and splash fight!

My go-to car wash a few miles from home.  The actual wash does a decent job and I always go for the hand towel dry after going through the wash.    About every other wash I go for the complete interior job as well.  They work pretty quickly, so you only have to sit outside for 10 or so minutes.  When the window guy is there, he's pretty easy to say "no thanks" to, not overly pushy.  Go with the new car scent.

Been here countless times for lunch and once for dinner- my birthday dinner at that. Rain looked to ruin our reservation at Cibo, so my bf and sister quickly changed plans to Harley's.   Our party of six was seated on time and had drinks and bread promptly. Everyone enjoyed their meals and drinks. The lemon drop martini I had was fabulous. My birthday dessert was tiramisu and it was incredible.   Every lunch experience has been with Justin- he is by far one of the best servers in the city! The bread is simple and hot. But the infused olive oil steals the show. You can purchase and enjoy at home. The gnocchi and ravioli are amazing!   The prices are fair and menu extensive. I love Harley's and will continue to dine there whenever I'm craving great Italian!

I've visited twice now and have yet to eat...hey I'd rather drink my dinner.  I come from smallis Spokane Wash and this place reminds me of Spokane or Seattle.  I'm a fan of the patio, they've even hung Christmas ornaments from the trees.  Hey, I'm a chick who appreciates little touches that makes the place a bit  festive.  The service both times has been a little slow, but always friendly.  The Washington Apple shots we had were made to perfection and this is a Wash girl talking here.  We parked across the street and I found it hilarious that a 17 year old boy was guarding the lot from VIG patrons- ha!  Will return to the VIG soon for certain!

Stopped by for a few drinks and shots before the Warren Miller show last Friday. What a cool place! As my first time in Tempe, I was pleasantly surprised that this place wasn't a trendy college bar. The shuffleboard, Christmas Story leg lamp, and board games nailed to the walls won me over. Plus, the fire place burning on the big screen TV brought me back to Washington if only for a minute. Friendly staff, good drinks, clean rest rooms all make Monkey Pants a winner in my book. Oh and Natural Lights (I think that is what the guys ordered) in a paper bag? Priceless.

It's slow.  Very slow. It was packed.  Very packed.  You could run a Free Dental Clinic out of the thing and never run out of patients.  You would, however, run out of patience if you had to take this thing everyday.  I see it being useful when drinking...and we did.

Rode downtown last Friday night for the First Friday festivities.  An older gentleman gave us his all day passes as he was exiting the 19th Ave and Bethany stop.  Sweet, we didn't have to pay!  I quickly realized though that him and his wife's tickets were reduced fare for seniors.  I guess you can get a ticket if you have the wrong type of ticket.  Enter Light Rail "Security Officers".  That was our cue to get off.  We walked one mile, got back on at the next stop, and rode the rest of the way hassle-free.  I love the Light Rail!

Being a Washington State girl, I am obligated to love Starbucks. And I do for the most part. I think I love the IDEA of Starbucks more than the actual coffee. I love their story and the history of the company. I love the green straws. It is branding at its finest and since I am in Marketing...blah, blah, blah.   I am missing locally owned and operated corner coffee stands. I cannot believe these are not popular here in Phoenix. The drinks are usually much better, cheaper, and most offer punch cards to earn a free drink.   Anyhow, this Starbucks is kitty-corner from my office...sweet! The staff is friendly and funny-ish. I'm sure I will know all of their names in no time at all.

This is my go-to Starbucks, less than a block from my office.  I'm the Dutchess, actually.  They know me by name.  :)    They tend to be busy most of the time, but the line always moves quickly.  The entire crew is so friendly and takes time to chat with customers who want to chat back.  Kudos to James, Derek and everyone at this location.  I hear the staff will be dismantled once the new City Scape location opens and this location shuts its doors.  Some will go to the new location, others to various other locations.  Boo!!

Just about everyone has wonderful things to say about St. Francis...and I'm no different. But I will make this review short and sweet.   The decor and overall feel of the place is uber cool and reminds me of Seattle in a way.   I've been twice now and both times service has been outstanding. Maybe just a touch slow, but everyone in CenPho is trying to get into this place. I get it...they're busy. And for good reason.   Which leads me to the food and drink section of my review. The green chili pork stew ($12) is amazing! Not too spicy, but bold flavors that go great with the cornbread. Also fantastic is the romaine salad with endive, bacon, apples, and a creamy cheddar dressing ($9). I have an allergy to apples and this was worth the slight break out in my throat. Too much info? Sorry folks...just telling the whole story. My two favorite items so far are the sweet corn polenta ($3 side dish) and the baked goat cheese with a tomato, walnut, hard pesto. They are both out of this world!! One one thing I would like to let Management know is that the little bread served with the goat cheese is so dang hard, they made my month hurt. Seriously, these puppies are CRISPY! So even with the apples and the bread that makes your mouth bleed St Francis still earns a 5 star in my book.  Try the St Francis Meyer Lemonade ($9) as well.  A little pricey, but VERY de-lish!   St Francis is fabulous both for a date night and dinner with the girls.  But what can I say, Dottsy and Nico are two of my favorite people. :) Can't wait to take my sister here next week when she visits!

I only had drinks in the bar, Mateo's I believe it's called. The bartender, "Captain" Ron was very friendly and made a great margarita....Like I'm sure most bartenders in Phoenix. Chatted with a couple cool ladies sitting at the bar who lived in the area, they said they are regulars and love the place. I will be back to try the food very soon.

Two floors and two very different crowds. Both floors were very entertaining, as in great people watching! We chilled on the upper floor for a while- enjoyed the techno music (complete with a girl dancing next to the speaker who was on some substance other than alcohol). There are partial views from the rooftop bar and energetic DJ's.  Downstairs was dimly lit with great hip-hop music.  We danced for over an hour and stayed until closing.  We don't go downtown much, but may go more often now.

I cannot get enough of Paris Envy!  It's the cutest little shop along 7th Avenue. Laurie, the owner, is the sweetest gal and you can tell she loves what she does.  This boutique is the perfect place to find a unique gift, something pretty for your home or handmade jewelry.  Over the years I've purchased: silk throw pillows, earrings, a beautiful custom angel wing wall hanging (Laurie's business partner makes most of the furniture and other home decor), candles, multiple gifts, and on and on.  Stop by when you're in the area...you won't regret it!

I've dined at Switch several times over the last 2.5 years.  My first visit was actually the Yelp Elite Black & White Party.  They were out to impress that night, and certainly did!  Thomas was a fabulous host and the party was a blast!  Lately, I've been meeting clients or friends for lunch or grabbing to-go when I've pulled an extra long day at the office.  I've tried many things that have all been great, but keep going back to the same item- Pamplona Veggie Burger.  It is AMAZING!!  It's a black bean, soy patty with corn in it as well.  The burger includes shredded spinach, sun-dried tomato spread, aioli & chipotle sherry dressing, and topped with an onion ring.  I always add goat cheese.  I was hesitant to order a veggie burger, since I eat all types of meat.  I cannot be more happy that I did!  Switch offers modern decor, low lighting, and friendly service.  This is a fabulous sister business of FEZ.  Mark Howard and his team continue to do a superb job!

I'm craving a Tinga taco just writing this review.  I love Cien Agaves' tacos!  You can order them individually, as part of a meal with beans and rice, or a platter of 10 for $35.  Pork, carne asada, chicken, potato, lobster..you name it, they have it.  Whether you like mild or spicy, are not a meat eater, whatever... You'll find the perfect taco for you.  Their patio is basically a narrow walkway with wobbly tables.  That's the only negative here in my book.

We stayed 4/9-4/12/2010 with my sister and her boyfriend.  I am not usually a fan of sharing a room with others, but we knew going in this would be a major party weekend.  Plus, my sis was there on business and her company paid for one of the nights we were there.  The great news is that our standard room was huge!  Two queen beds, separate living room with large L-shaped couch and table and chairs.  Plus, the biggest bathroom in a Vegas hotel I've ever stayed in.  The bathtub and shower were amazing.  It was nice to use the vanity with stool to apply make up and fix our hair too.  We visited the pool area all three days.  It's a lovely area, but nothing to rave about.  We went into the adults only pool area and it too was just ok.  No topless women in case you were curious.  Just 21+ only.  Beautiful furnishings and class all around, I really loved our stay at the Palazzo.  We even saw Joan Rivers twice.  Once while dining at Lavo, which I'll write a separate review on, but it was an incredible dinner.  I'm hoping to return soon!

Went to Bomberos for the first time last Monday and had a fabulous time!  I was so excited to try this place, but slightly nervous bringing the bf.  Some wine bars can be too stiff or try to be too fancy.  But not Bomberos.  We choose to sit outside on the patio and the fire pit was blazing.  Very romantic, plus the music was very hip.    Our server, Julie, was very helpful as we selected our bottle of Pinot Noir.  She was very friendly, but could have checked on us a tiny bit more.  For food we had the Trio of Bruscetta- we ordered the Traditional mozzarella, basil, and tomato; Fig and Gorgonzola; and Proscetta and goat cheese.  All were very good.  The one with mostly fig (I think the gorgonzola) could of had a bit more cheese, it was a bit overwelming with figs.  We also had the salami panini and it was fantastic.  We will be back soon for certain.  I hear Saturday offers live music outside.  Bomberos will be a regular place for us for sure!

I love malls. I love Costco. Put them together and you've got pure bliss. Oh wait...this mall is GHETTO with a capital G. Well all Caps really. The Costco may be the only redeeming factor of this "mall"   Finding out that I live 6 minutes from a Costco makes my life very easy. I made my first Phoenix Costco trip last weekend to get everything needed for a great BBQ, minus the keg which Nico handled. Everything was just as it is in Washington, although I am still in awe over buying liquor in any supermarket-type store. State ran liquor stores are such a hassle.   I wanted to bake a cake for Nico's friend Jesse's birthday, but ran out of time. Costco to the rescue! I got a chocolate bundt-type cake with chocolate frosting drizzled on top...it was a huge hit. And only $9.99.   Park in the back of the store and you don't have to feel like you're actually going shopping at the mall.  Costco gas, always cheaper, is in the back as well.    PS- Kirkland, WA is one of the most beautiful places to visit.  Twenty minutes from Seattle.  Go to give thanks to a wonderful place called Costco.

I have not seen this item anywhere else other than Costco, so I have been entering Costco for one mere item (not a wise decision!)  I'm not sure of the actual brand or maker of this salad, but I am addicted!  I am obsessed with the bagged salad kit which includes: butter and romaine lettuce, blue cheese crumbles, dried cherries, sliced almonds, and the best vinaigrette dressing ever. I'm telling you, go tonight and get this salad!  It is soooo good.  These flavors all together is so summery and zingy.  Yes, zingy.  It makes my mouth and figure happy! I can eat 3-4 helpings (big bowls) per bag and the bags are just $3.25!  Just wanted to pass on a little find to all you Yelpers out there looking for a new salad.  I know I can get pretty bored of the same ol thing all of the time. :)

Forget Semi Homemade with Sandra Lee...it's more like Semi Homemade and Fabulous with Teresa Marie.  Seriously, I have never loved a supermarket more.  AJ's is amazing, don't get me wrong; but for everyday, affordable groceries, F & E is the place for me.  (could I have put more commas in that sentence?!)  Watch for $3 and $5 off coupons in the mail.  They don't work on wine or beer though!  Even so, I love me some Fresh & Easy!

Best Pad Thai I've had in Phoenix! And I've tried several since moving here last year.   Cute, smaller Thai place, but the decor is tastefully done. Friendly service and they do a great job of keeping diners in a tight lunch hour on schedule.   The homemade salad dressing is amazing and I love the fact that the little salad is included with any meal. If you live or work near Park Central, I would highly recommend Thai Basil!

I met Roxy for wine and pizza Tuesday evening.  I showed up at about 6:20pm and the place was packed!  The place is little, but adds to the charm.  They don't win any interior decorating awards, but it is cute enough.  We sat at a two-top right in between two other two-tops.  We even chatted with our neighbors a bit.  It seemed the others were regulars.  Server Ed was super friendly too.  When I arrived, Roxy had already ordered me a glass of wine and a pizza.  So I did not look at their menu.  Doesn't matter though- the pinot grigio was very tasty and on happy hour I believe.  The pizza was very, very delicious.  Great crust and sauce and their version of the Margarita pizza was spot on.  Traditional tomato, basil, and mozzarella, with added pancetta.  it was fabulous. It was a perfect summer dinner for 2 ladies.  I'm sure we will be back soon, it's nice to break up the Postino's trips now and then.

I love stopping in every couple months to see what new items they've gotten in. Some things are just not my style, but there is always a great assortment of wood, glass, metal, cloth, and ceramic functional art.   I've purchased several sets of wine bottles turned into glasses by Refresh Glass.  Everyone I've given a set to has loved them. You may have seen Ray's glasses in both Postinos locations.   Some things seem over-priced, but I get it. They are local,  struggling  (maybe?) artists trying to make a living. And for that, I support them!

Love me some SideBar! Reminds me of Seattle, in a good way.   I celebrated my 30th Birthday here in February. (Yes, I said 30. Here's where you send me a compliment stating I don't look a day over 25.)   The drinks are damn tasty at SideBar. My fave is the CenPhoPolitan..or something very close to that. A little pricey, but not every place can serve $2 Coors Lights. Actually, they only serve Bud Light...sorry to my friend Roberta.   Great music, vibe, urban space that I dig. My only gripe is that they don't serve any real food. They don't have a permit to serve hot food, so pita chips and prepackaged hummus is the extent of the menu. Oh well, come after dinner and prepare to get Sideways at SideBar!

My toes have been sheltered from sunlight for quite some time now.  I wanted to get a pedicure before heading to Phoenix, but walking through the snow in flip flops just does not interest me.  Nico's mom and grandma go to V-K's so I gave them a try.  I walked in without an appointment and had to wait about 20 minutes before Jenna started her magic.  It was very nice that they let me wait in the pedicure chair to enjoy the chair massage and warm water on my tootsies.  The pedicure itself was great.  Jenna gave me a fabulous foot and leg massage and all for $20, which is what I spend in Spokane.  I couldn't have been happier about that.  I will be back for my next pedicure next time I'm back in Phoenix.

What is there to say that hasn't already been said on Yelp?  *Great wine...love the $5 glasses before 5pm  *Yummy food...love all the bruschettas, prosciutto and brie panini, and mixed green salad, I ususally do the 'pick 2' and it's plenty for me  *Atmosphere....modern and cozy at the same time.  Very Seattle-ish.  Great patio, can't wait to get out there again once it cools down a bit.  *Friendly and attentive servers..always seems 2-3 people end up helping out.  I love team players!  Still haven't been to the original Postino, but when I live so close to this location...why would I?  Thank you Postino for giving this NW girl a slice of home.  Can't wait to bring out of town guests to see for themselves. :)

Same great food!   Same great service!   Same great wine!   Same great wine specials...wait scratch that last part! I have come to love Wednesdays at Postino for their fabulous $5 per glass special if you say the "word of the day". Or write it on your business card as their facebook page says to do. $5 per glass of any wine or pitcher of beer all night long. Well, Wednesdays are whack now! They've discontinued their Wednesday special for no other reason than, "we just stopped doing it" I was told. Whaaaaa Wednesdays are now what I'm calling them.   I still love you Postino, but will have to plan my visits a little differently. My wallet doesn't flow over like wine like I wish it did.

BEST cell phone transaction experience I've ever had!  Julian, Sales Associate was helpful, friendly, and very professional.  Decent rates: I'll be saving money from switching from T-Miserable and now have the White HOT iPhone!!  I'm in love.  All around just a great trip to the AT&T store.  Friendly staff, huge selection of merchandise, and most importantly, they had the white 4G iPhone in stock.  And a neon pink and aqua blue phone case. Long live the 80's!

Location really is the top benefit to this station being my close to exclusive fill up joint.  It's on the corner of Roosevelt and 7th Street with good access from either street.  They charge like $.10 more if you use debit or credit, which doesn't seem to motivate me to keep more cash on me.  All in all, this Shell is convenient, clean, and safe.

Note on review: I've been twice for lunch, but no dinner yet.   I LOVE the decor of Modern Steak. I feel like I'm in a dreamy, European lounge. The colors are feminine, but classy. I don't think men would feel too out of place here.  The patio is beautiful and the fireplaces are a nice touch. I also have sat in the bar on the comfiest chairs ever. The entire feel is just so NICE.  And the Ladies Room is beautiful!   I could live in there in exchange for food and wine.  The Salmon dish on the lunch menu is one of the best salmon dishes I have ever had. It is served with three sweet potato cakes and they are divine as well. The salad I tried was excellent too, but I cannot remember exactly which one it was.   As I am writing this review I am now wanting to go back for dinner very soon. Another great concept from FOX!

It is Independence week and I LOVE me some America's!  Five stars for the bean and cheese burrito.  The. Best. I've. Ever. Had. They don't use lard and it's just so cheesy and delicious!   Four stars for everything else I've tried- tacos, salsa, chips.  Somewhat limited menu, but I'll only be going back for the burritos!  Cute, cute place.  I love the artwork and I plan on buying a piece for Nico sometime soon.  The "Taco Tuesday" piece calls to me each time I'm at America's.  I wish them all the best as they prepare for their new Tempe location!

I don't have a lot to compare it to as I don't frequent many pawn shops, but Pawn 1st is #1 to me. I was here on business (to meet with the owner), and was greeted by the friendliest staff. These guys are seriously more outgoing than many staffers at Nordstrom!   The store is neat, clean, and as one reviewer noted "doesn't stink like other pawn shops." No bars on the windows, guns or swords in the cases, and the staff is not armed like many other shops.  And from what I can tell, they have all of their teeth.  No really, they are all really nice guys!   Every time I visit Pawn 1st they are somewhat busy. In these tough economic times, people need a safe and friendly place to get a loan or pawn some of their valuables. Or get some great deals on movies, games, or jewelry.  I even bought a few DVDs, for $3.00 each!  Keep up the good work, guys!

Well, I'll never get that 20 minutes back.  The bad and ugly..not sure there was a good.    I phoned the 7th Ave location of Edible Arrangements thinking it was the closest to my client's office.  There is a $12 delivery fee to drive less than 3 miles.  Seems a bit much to me.  I was on hold for over 10 minutes. I think the poor guy on the phone was the only employee working at the time.  Overall, the entire experience was unpleasant.  The product seems overpriced, along with poor customer service.  I'd rather give my client a fruit tray from AJ's.

What's not to like about a second Vig, this one MUCH closer to my house? Actually, just a couple things. But let me start with the good.   I love the feel of the place as you walk in the door. Cozy and yummy colors. It's nice that they used an existing building. Would of been cool if they had used the first proposed name- The Vault. I just love the whole place...until you walk to the back. I understand why they are calling it a PATIO or OUTDOOR SEATING, but I'm not feeling it. It's cold, dark, gray, and not the same loveliness as the original Vig patio. Both times I have been here, it's been with friends and they were already sitting in this back area. That is what I am calling it from now on, by the way, the back area. My smoker friends appreciate the fact they can go out the back door to slowly kill themselves, but they've also almost been hit by the Valet guys pulling cars around.   I need to go in the sunniest part of the day and enjoy those big windows when they are doing their thing best.   The food is, of course, the same quality as the other Vig and you can always count on getting a yummy, if not slightly overpriced dish.   Kudos to James, the server. He handled our large group well and was prompt and friendly.   Overall, I am very excited to have this Vig in my hood, within bike riding range no less. I'm sure they are still getting some kinks worked out and they could use to add a few more light bulbs in the 'back area'. I know I'll be back to enjoy the Vig for fun times are always had at the Vig.

After having to move a block south last year due to the Light rail expansion, Big Burrito is now in the shopping center at 19th Ave & Northern, on the northwest corner next to Sprouts.   This is our go-to breakfast burrito place on the weekends. I can get my Starbucks across the street while Nick runs over to pick up our burritos that we've already called in.   We get the same thing everytime..I know how boring...but the egg, potato, bacon, and cheese burrito is just so damn tasty. Their green and red sauces are standard, but good. One burrito could easily be shared between two people, or maybe 2 women. I can never finish mine, but that's what I have Nico for.   I stopped by last night and picked up a bean and cheese burrito and a cheese crisp. I love that fact that they grill the burrito for a minute after the wrap it up. The cheese crisp was not very crispy and was almost a little soggy by the time I got home.   All in all, this is a great little neighborhood shop with friendly service and reasonable prices.  If you live in this area, you should give them a try!

I'm sure I will be losing my Duchess status of Spoonz soon.  I have been going less and less over the last couple months, and they are housed on the lobby level of my building.  The service has been just ok since Vita left.  The owner (female) is really unpleasant and doesn't seem to be happy about being there.  The Scottsdale panini is decent, although the quality of the chicken seems a little lowered recently.  The owner (male) once told my coworker and I  that they cook the meat offsite and simply heat it back up at Spoonz.  Something about not having a proper oven/grill?   An ex employee of Spoonz was an incredible pastry chef and made amazing desserts.  Not sure how the treats are now, as I'm skeptical there's a bunch of "boxed" desserts.  For coffee, I'd rather walk a few hundred yards more for Starbucks.  Wow, this review really is quite negative.  Spoonz is good when you're in a pinch downtown.  I doubt people are going too far out of their way to come here.

No line at 11:25am on a Tuesday.  Friendly staff, fresh ingredients, and decent prices make this newest addition to downtown a good one to put into to-go lunch rotation.    Cityscape is poorly designed, in my opinion, but at least Chipotle received one of the best locations- highly visible from Washington Street.    They've recently added brown rice and it's just as tasty as their white rice.  I love that they offer so much variety, it helps when trying to keep your meal as healthy as possible.    Welcome to the neighborhood, Chipotle!

Great juices at reasonable prices. Good, but not always great customer service. Unsure if they use any organic fruits & veggies. Minus one star because they don't allow phone-in orders.
