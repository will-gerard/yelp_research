This is for for the VOLKSWAGEN side only.  I was told by the MANAGER and he salesman that they had the car that I saw online in stock and to come out the next day to look at it.   I drive over 30 miles to see this car.  As soon as I get there, they said Oh, the car sold today, the people are in financing right now.   Now one was there, they tried the old bait and switch on me!  I got out of there as fast as I could.  Why would I want to work with ANYONE who flat out lied to me?  Stay far away from this place....

The garlic knots are to die for.....i could eat a huge bowl for them for my meal.  I really, really, really hate that they have a wait staff so you have to tip. I think it would be more family friendly if you ordered at the counter, took a seat, and waited for your food to be ready to either pick up at the counter or have someone just bring it to the table like other pizza joints.

I love this center.  It is usually not too crowded, sometimes camps come there, so it will get a little busier on weekdays.  The slides are fun, lots of chairs and shade, nice staff, hot showers.  I like that the pool is not too deep, so it is good for the kids.  Free lunch and snack in June and most of July, too!

Terrible Service, the food was overpriced for what you get.  The squid salad was dry and lacked flavor, the Eel sauce needed more flavor, the rice wasn't sticky enough. The Fish is fresh.  But I don't think I would not return.  I prefer the The Sushi Room because there is more flavor in their rolls and salads and the rolls are bigger.

Wow, they make a REALLY excellent Italian Beef sandwich....just like Chicago.  I LOVED the sauce and sausage on the pizza;however, they need to perfect the crust....it seems pre-made, not like CHicago, but the sauce, cheese, sausage is JUST like Chicago...amazing.  I hope they make the crust change.  We will be back when we are in the area.

Thanks Yelp for telling me about this place!  It is so yummy!  The Korean food is outstanding here.....the Japanese food is good not, but there is better places.  A must try is the Bulgogi and the Beef Rib soup.  That soup was so amazing.  The veggies were soft, the ribs were tender, and the broth was delicious.   It's one of my new favorite soups.  The Korean veggies that came with the meal were fantastic, too.  I really enjoyed the mashed potato, cucumber, and broccoli sides.  I cannot wait to go back.  The only thing I didn't like was smelling like the place when I left!  They could use some better air flow in the place!

We still LOVE this place.  We tried the fried quesadilla with Carnitas yesterday.  AMAZING.  The pork is so good and it tasted light even tough it was fried and it came with the BEST sauce.   I am still a huge fan of their Carne Asada tacos and the Burrito with Carne Asada.  My kids are obsessed with the beef tongue and pig stomach tacos.   I am not brave enough to try them.  The Torte sandwich is HUGE and made with their amazing Carnitas.   Everyone needs to try this place....

They loved the Italian Sausage with Mozzarella cheese sandwich and Tomato Bisque soup.   My kids love the mac and cheese, grilled cheese, and build your own kids sandwich, too.  The only thing that is lacking is the super friendly, chatting staff.  I love supporting local places and just with the staff was excited to see us as we are to see them....

I do NOT like this place.  I think it is way too salty...especially the sausage.  The pizza is just so so to me.  I will not return because for the money, there are better places in the area.

I am so glad I had a Groupon because this place is over priced and just ok.  The crust is ok, not that great and the sauce is terrible.  We will NOT be back.  All hype and about the atmosphere, not the food.

I really enjoyed the Beef Stew Noodle Soup here.  It was very delicious.  I cannot wait to try the other soups.  The Meat Pies and Buns were good, but not my favorite.  The staff is very friendly and the food is fresh.  It's a lot better than most Chinese places and this one others a lot of different types of Chinese food.  It was a nice change.

I love this place and so do my kids.  They have the best burgers and fries.  I really like they way they season the burgers.  Another bonus is the bun, it is excellent.  I think it is tastier than Five Guys and Freddies.  The staff is super friendly too.  I suggest everyone try it.

I loved the comedians!  They actually have some really great talent coming to the place.  However, drink prices are crazy high and the wait staff gets in the way a lot.  I also HATED waiting outside on the stairs to go into the place...that is just stupid to do in ARIZONA!  But over all, I liked it and I would go back!

This is by far the BEST place for kids 12 and under to get a haircut.  My girls were soooo in love with their cuts.  The staff is wonderful and the products they use are amazing.  It was nice not smelling chemicals at a hair salon!  Definitely give this place a try!

Overrated.  This place was so rude, the food was ok, and the prices were a little high for what you get.  Skip this place and go to ACE in Mesa.  Way tastier and ACE is a lot cheaper.  Never going here again.

What a great new location.  No more waiting for hours.  The manager was AMAZING.  I was sad that my pizza didn't have their awesome tomato sauce on it, so she had them make me a new Wiseguy with the sauce.  Now that is some Great service.  The place is cute.  Easy to park.  We will be back!  The crust and tomato sauce it what makes the pizza so amazing.

The Salad dressing is soooo good here!  I think this is a great place to go in a hurry.  Much better option over fast food.   The Miso soup and salad is amazing.  The Avocado roll is one of my favorites, too.  My husband really likes the Combo of Beef and Chicken Teriyaki bowl.  I love that you don't have to pay a tip, too!  It makes everything faster when you order at the counter!  The place is very clean and has plenty of seating.   They also serve alcohol.

This place is awesome!  Lots of flavor, nice staff.  The hatch green chili sauce is wonderful.  It tastes just like the sauce at the Pepper Pot in Hatch, New Mex.  The Fry Bread is delicious!  Not too greasy and very soft.  The green chili stew is quite spicy, but full of great flavor!  This place is a MUST try!

It's a good price, 24/7. They need a BETTER news tv station.  Fox News is TERRIBLE.   Why not have Fox and CNN?  I wish they would tell people that they need to CLEAN the machines after they use them and monitor the 30 minute workout better....it seems like people have NO clue how to use the area....it is not a free weight section people, you need to switch places when the light turns red!!!!

Great service.  The waitress was really awesome!  The pizza was handmade and very delicious!  Lots of cheese, yummy sauce, and the crust was fresh, handmade.  The bratwurst sliders are so flavorful!  The pretzel bun is perfect for them.  The house made chips were really good too.  The quality of the food is really good and the prices are fantastic!  There are plenty of games to play.  The place was spotless too!  The liked the decor/ambiance.  High class, yet casual.  No smoking is a huge plus too!  I love that we can come here and then head to the casino later.  The bowling alley there looks like fun, too!  Free shoe rental and child movie prices if you show your total rewards card....

This place is just awesome.  I love supporting family owned places.  The salads are amazing here. I LOVE the Caesar Salad, ask them to add some of the roasted red peppers to it to make it even more amazing.   They have great fresh bread, too.  I had the Lasagna.  I really love their red sauce.   I cannot wait to come back.  The prices are excellent or the amount and quality of food.  You MUST try this place if you like home cooked, not chain Italian food.

They have the BEST sausage!  They know how to make a good pizza.  Best pizza I have had in the East Valley.  He gets the cheese imported from Wisconsin and the sausage from the Southside of Chicago.  The owners are very nice.  If you are from Chicagoland and want a yummy thin sausage pizza, COME here.

Ok, this is the BEST new place I have been to in a LONG time.  They really do FRESH food well.   The house salad uses local farm lettuce and the ranch dressing is homemade.  Sooooo, much flavor.  I really like the jicama, cucumber, onion salad that was on top of the lettuce, too.   My kids LOVED the White truffle mac and cheese.. it was rich and flavorful.   The chorizo sliders were served on a great bun with a tasty little side salad.   We decided to try the crepe.  SOOOOOOO, good.  The orange butter sauce was so yummy.....I wanted a bowl of it.  The ice cream was the amazing Vanilla from Sweet Republic.   We cannot wait to go back.  The burger and pork belly will be tried next time....they smelled amazing.   The staff and owner were really friendly, too.   I wish them lots of success.

Went back for lunch using the groupon we bought.  It is STILL amazing.  That ranch dressing is so good!  I really enjoyed that salad and burger we shared.  We had to get the crepe again for dessert.  It was even better then the 1st time we tried it.  I LOVE this place.  I cannot wait to go back.

That was the most bland meal ever!  The green chili pork slider meat had no seasoning!  The local special was super bland too!  The beer cheese was again, BLAND!  Salt and pepper is needed on the tables to make the food better!  Soooo disappointed! Plus I was over charged for my food. Server was terrible....never brought the new itemized bill.  What an annoying night!
