I love coming here to get my hair done (color & styled). JULIA is the best hairdresser I could find and she does my hair in record time in comparison to other salons I have been to in the past. This salon also offers makeup and nails (so you don't have to go anywhere else).  JESSICA does a great job if you need your makeup done.    It's a great salon in the Arcadia area.

One of my favorite Sushi spots considering Mido has an all you can eat option for just over $20. No Sushi conveyor belt here. The rolls are made as you order. A small side salad, miso soup and an appetizer option of sashimi, gyoza, or mixed vegetable tempura. The entire meals ends with a scoop of ice cream (green tea ice cream: my personal fave). Who can say no to that!

I suggest you DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY if you want your house fixed. This company has HORRIBLE service. They were referred by my friend's insurance company so we thought they were good. They did some work on the flooding of the AC. My friend called them back because they kept putting off the time they were supposed to finish the work. 12 DAYS LATER and after numerous calls and messages to DC restoration they still never got back to the client about finishing the work they started. After they finally called back, the client complained about them not getting back to the client to finish the work. They did not even apologize and told the client to use another company! Very unprofessional.

I really like coming here for any and all of my waxing needs. Amber is the best. I make sure I ask for her every time I come to this location.   The best part is that you can get your nails done next door and grab a drink afterwards since it's located in Tempe Market Place.   They have great deals such as unlimited wax packages for a year!

I love sitting at the bar. The coconut shrimp tacos are yummy with the Spanish rice and potatoes. Friendly atmosphere, a great place to meet people. Although I was not drinking, the bartender was awesome. Excellent service!

This is the BEST Vape/E-Cig business in the Valley! The staff go above and beyond to make sure the customers are happy. They have the best products and juices that I have been able to find (and god knows ive been to a multitude of shops), hands down the most fun i've had has been at BUTTOUT. I dare not buy juice from any other place but here. Best juice: Melon Mashup and Amazeballs. You'll never use anything else.

The chocolate chip cookies at the best. So far, my personal fave is the Hawaiian Barbeque Sandwich. I have always heard great review from customers who know Earl of Sandwich. I can say my first time was a winning experience. Customers Service was above and beyond. :)
