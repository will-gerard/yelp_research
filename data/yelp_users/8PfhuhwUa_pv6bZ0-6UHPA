I've been here several times and it's amazing every time I go. The vegetables are fresh and crunchy - and the dishes are super tasty! I can't wait to go back. My favorite is the shrimp noodle dish; one of their specialties.

I was not impressed. Their chicken panini had a three inch piece of bone in it so I had been carefully picking through the meal when I saw a blood vessel (looked like an artery). I was totally done with the sandwich at that point. The fries were tasty though.

The food was fantastic and the ambiance was very cool. I was there for Saturday brunch so there was live music. I'd love to try their regular menu!
