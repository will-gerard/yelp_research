My former seamstress went out of business and I was in a crunch. My parents take their drycleaning to LCS and recommended I try them for a bridesmaid alteration and they did a great job! It looked and fit great, just how I had asked and she got it done ahead of time! A little pricier than I was used to ($65 for a shortened hem, but on chiffon), but I was very happy with my experience there.

Blimpies still exist? I was looking for something different from my usual work lunch stops so landed here. The place is kind of depressing (as are the owners), the ingredients for my veggie sub (I didn't trust the processed meat) were minimal and didn't look super fresh. The bread is very thick and takes away from what there is to enjoy of the sub. A poor man's Subway for sure, that will teach me to stray from the standards.

Ah, the place where dreams go to die. I find most casinos in Arizona to be a little depressing, this was no exception. It's pretty small, but they do offer all the games, including tables, bingo (and late night bingo parties) and keno and it's easily accessible, so it will do on occasion, when I can handle all the smoke for a few hours.

Nadya and her daughter are very friendly and it was a joy taking my bridesmaid dress to her for alterations.  It looked fantastic, like it hadn't even been altered, when I picked it up and it fit so much better!  I'm so glad they are close to my home because I will be taking all my clothes there from now on!

Love getting my car washed here. They are fast (for how crowded it usually is) and my car looks great. Basic washes are reasonably priced so I should definitely come more often! The car wash sales guys use way too much pressure to up-sell. I told you what I want, just give me that! They got me on a detailing package once (after working through 3 higher level packages I told him were not in my budget and he just kept going). The detailing did seem like a good deal and I didn't want it just then, but I was able to save it to use another time. When I finally did go back to use it, they quoted I think four hours and it was actually a little under! The only issue there was the car looked incredible, but the glass over my odometer was dirty and spotty...from the other reviews it sounds like they need to notice those little details!   My good review is mostly because of my last experience. I went in over the weekend to get my oil changed with a coupon I had received in the mail, $25 and it includes a wash...perfect! On a Saturday morning, I was able to get right in and the tech was very helpful. They checked over everything to make their "recommendations" while I was still in the car filling out paperwork. I'm so over the Jiffy Lubes who make it sound like my car is about to fall apart and tell me I need every add-on imaginable and knowing Cobblestone already kind of upsells, I was expecting it, but he was very honest telling me everything looked good (even the air filter, it's always the air filter), which is awesome considering it had been nine months since my last change and I'd just rolled past 100k miles. He did suggest a transmission flush, which is not a cheap service when I'm just expecting a discounted oil change and wash, but there was no pressure to do it, he just marked it down as a recommendation (and I went home and had the boyfriend check it and tell me it's good for a while longer). The tech pointed out that my coupon was actually expired but that they may still take it. I mentioned it to the cashier and he did accept it and my car was back out from the wash very quickly. I'm quite happy with the service.

I picked this vet based on convenience (and Yelp reviews of course), but I am very happy with the care my pup gets. The staff genuinely care about all animals and it's the one place I'm not embarassed that he's a social barker! They really don't mind!  I've been there for routine visits...shots and meds aren't cheap, but they try to save you money by combining visits and with rebates as often as possible. They were very helpful via phone when I had a maybe emergency. They've seen it all, of course I trust their advice!

New tires and alignment took a day and a half!  The shop managers for the most part were unapologetic and very quick to throw each other and everyone else under the bus because with each one I talked to, they admitted it was taking too long, but it wasn't their fault.   Luckily it wasn't a huge inconvenience, but the blame game was what really bugged me along with their overpromising and underdelivering...when I checked in on the first day, they said they "weren't leaving until it was finished." An hour later when the shop was closing, I was told it needed two more hours worth of work and they'd call me the next morning. Disappointing!

You have to love a local brewery and Four Peaks has a great reputation around the valley. The Scottsdale Four Peaks has a different feel than the original Tempe location and obviously attracts a different crowd - older, calmer.  I remember liking the food at Tempe, but that was years ago and since I've started going to this location, I haven't been too impressed with the standard bar fare, but it's a great place to get a local beer. The peach and the Sun Bru are my favorites.

Warner Family is a well-oiled machine, which is good, they're very efficient, but it does leave it up to the patient to make sure he or she is seen and treated as an individual.   I've found it easy to get in for unplanned visits (as long as it doesn't matter who you see), but they book physicals (which they pretty much make you do on an annual basis to be seen for anything) way out.  The office was in walking distance of my first place when I moved to Chandler, but since then I've moved to North Scottsdale, but I still make the drive because despite some hassles, I do believe I get good care. Mornings are pretty crowded and you may end up waiting, but I've been in the mid-afternoon and it was mostly empty and pretty quick to get in.

I overheard a few visitors commenting on their surprise at the Monet on exhibit. No, you don't expect Phoenix to be a spectacular cultural destination, but this museum is big with a handful of interesting collections and they get some great exhibitions that come through. You WILL recognize some of the artists and you'll likely see and enjoy pieces you didn't expect!  It's a great way to spend an afternoon - I walked through everything in twoish hours, but easily could have taken more time and do plan on going back to do just that! With free admission every Wednesday and during First Fridays, as well as the Culture Pass available from local libraries and opening on holiday Mondays when they're normally closed, they really want to make the museum accessible and remind Phoenicians that it's not just hot here, we've got culture too!   So go ahead and act like a tourist for a day. Plus, after you've worked up your appetite, there are plenty of great restaurants around to rest your feet and talk about your favorite pieces...like the unmarked back corner room on the top floor of the South Wing, it's worth getting all the way through!

I'm not really a golfer, but living in Scottsdale, I see beautiful courses all the time, so playing on the dead grass was a bit of a bummer. It was a gorgeous sunny and 70s day in January, so of course our tee time was delayed, but I thought the staff was friendly.   Friends who actually golf told me I'd have a tough time with the course and probably really tick off groups behind me, but the course didn't feel too backed up; we played right on schedule and only had to wait at one or two holes and same with the group behind us. The hazards weren't too tricky, even being a non-golfer, I only donated one ball to the water. My brother-in-law donated one to a truck driving on the main road right by one of the tee boxes though! Eek!   Random complaint - the mirrors in the women's bathroom are for giants.

Scottsdale Stadium is a pretty large facility with the old school spring training feel. I like Salt River, but there's definitely something to be said about the older venues. Large variety for food and drink (overpriced, but hey, it's spring training, get over it), packed lawn with just a few shady spots when it gets too hot (remember your sunscreen!), small bathrooms = ridiculous lines. You cannot beat this location for pre- and post-game dining and drinking and many area bars/restaurants offer game day specials.

A favorite go-to for a delicious sandwich. Their sandwiches are made with the kitchen sink approach and it works fantastically. Everything looks great, but I can't seem to stray from the veggie and guac Humboldt. Love the friendly workers!

This is one of those auto shops that gives all auto shops a bad name!  They overcharge and the service advisor lied to me about my car.    I went to Hon-Amotive because I had a coupon for a $20 oil change and my poor little car was well overdue for one.  They are in a great location (the only thing going for them) and I was able to drop my car off and walk to Tempe Marketplace to get lunch while they worked on it.    When the service advisor, Mike Brennan, called to let me know that they were done with the oil change, he said my brakes were down to the bare minimum and recommended replacing them.    I'm clueless about cars (which he obviously picked up on) and if someone tells me something serious is wrong with it (like brakes!), my reaction is normally that I don't want to take on the expense, but what has to be done has to be done.  Luckily I was with a friend who recommended I hold off.  I went back, paid my $20 and picked up my car.  I talked to my neighbor who has an auto shop and he quoted me $100 less to do the brakes, so I made an appointment at his shop and when I took it in, he said I absolutely do not need new brakes!  He found nothing on my car to work on.  Thank goodness for honest mechanics like him!  I will never go to Hon-Amotive again and you shouldn't either!

Great patio, really great food (tacos, salads, sandwiches, burgers...all my favs), strong drinks, friendly staff. Generally too hipster for my tastes, but worth it because it's a lot more chill than Mill Ave. and skews at least a little older. You can't beat this place!

Great food, if just slightly overhyped. It's a cute building in a great location with friendly staff, but does not win my vote for best pizza in Phoenix, sorry! Definitely check it out though, it's top five, but be prepared to wait!

I've been here for both dinner and lunch - at lunch, the food is still good, but it was empty and kind of awkward. The unique decor really shines at night and the menu seems more appropriate as well. I had a delicious seabass picatta served with gnocchi. The service is fantastic!

An older theater that's keeping up with the new kids! Comfy, reserved seats with food service with a smile without the astronomical cost found at other luxury theaters. Food was pretty good, or with the great location, you could just go for the show and scope out one of the many nearby restaurants.

LOVE Dilly's! The Tempe location was a Thursday lunch time tradition with my high school girlfriends and now I work up by this location and still stop in every few weeks.  They've expanded the menu a lot, but I typically go for a Veggie Supreme. All their sandwiches are pressed to at least toast the bread - white or wheat.  A "half" sandwich is pretty much a whole sandwich with an inch cut off the top, so it's definitely enough food, but adding a side or a small soup bread bowl or side salad makes it a bigger meal if you're super hungry. The bread is delicious!

They do not have bridal gowns, just all the extras, including the biggest selection of bridesmaid dresses in the Valley from every designer you've been pinning - it's worth the drive!   If, like the upset bridezillas who gave low ratings for customer service issues, you need to be wooed while picking out an ugly dress you will never wear again, by all means, go somewhere else. It is low frills - and in fact, the first time I went there, I was told to just go home and order online - but again, the biggest selection PLUS the lowest prices. The second time I went, the sales girl was extremely helpful with my indecisive bridefriend, pulling together color schemes and explaining all the materials to us and we actually didn't end up ordering from them, but she got the bride on track and for that, I am eternally grateful.  Let's be honest, bridesmaids dresses are a necessary evil, so why not go to the WAS, have some fun with your girlfriends having your run of the place (it's so big and I have not seen it crowded) and get a cheap one?    The only negative is that the dress I ordered took a really long time to arrive, like longer than quoted, like it came in two weeks before the wedding. The wedding was out of state and the other bridesmaids actually ended up ordering from WAS as well because it was the cheapest option, but they ordered theirs even later and it took plenty of upset mother-of-the-bride calls to ensure they arrived on time. Now, if that's on the manufacturer or the store is unknown, but just proceed with caution and order way early just in case.

Super friendly staff serving fantastic food and you can't beat the 50-cent cup of coffee - hot or iced! Great vibe - lots of regulars making their required pre-work stop or hanging out on the weekends. I love their baked goods - unique flavors for scones, muffins and cookies!

Armitage is a cool, little place that has an intimate feel with old school class.  Inside, high-tops, booths, tables and more casual seating areas give you plenty of options, but on a warm evening, the patio can't be missed! Checking out the activity on Market Street, soaking up the sun, drinking a glass of wine. Can't beat it!   They have a large wine list, including flights, but they group them by type, so you get the Cab flight, you get three Cabs. I prefer variety, so I think the one time I got a flight I went with the red blends, all regular serving sizes, so look out! I've sampled a bit of the food but am a sucker for the bruschetta, hummus and fried ravioli I had once, but I'm not sure it's still on the menu.  The happy hours - different every day - are fun and that's when it tends to fill up. The service is unobtrusive, which may be seen as slow, but Armitage is such a great place for dates and girls' nights and the servers let you enjoy that without making you feel like they're trying to get you out! Enjoy the reminder to slow down!

Great workout in a great space with great people! I can only take so much "Sumits" flow. I need variety to make me feel like I'm working, not just putting in the time, so I like the move away from that and the way the new classes seem to be at least putting somewhat of a different spin on the routine. I love the hot studio and the way I feel after it, but don't discount the classes in Studio B! It's still warm and I like the variety of the Power classes, those instructors will make you work and sweat just as much!

This is one of the bigger WF in the area and is worth the extra drive past the one on Raintree that is actually closer to me. I don't do much grocery shopping here, but when I'm not sure what I want for lunch I head to their prepared food section and pick out what looks best - so many options plus indoor and outdoor seating! I usually end up at their sandwich counter, the design-it-yourself panini style sammies are fantastic.   This store is in a large commercial area and does get crowded at lunch, but it's worth it and let's be honest, a lot of the hungry patrons are cute business guy types or from the local hospital or gym, so I'm not complaining!

I went here looking for a low key place to get drinks with some friends, as it should be at a dive bar like Patties, but unfortunately the night before Thanksgiving everyone else was doing the same.   If there's a line out the front or the back, just go somewhere else. The staff, from the door guys to the servers, are completely untrained to handle any kind of crowd and it changed the vibe of our easy going night too fast.

This is my go-to hike when my dog needs to burn off some energy. Lots of trails and directions to go with different mileage, but my concern is not remembering which way I came from or how they all connect, so I usually hike in for about a half hour then turn around and go back. I have hiked up to the part that overlooks Taliesin West and it's a decent view, but for the most part, it's just a wash, not much up and down and kinda dusty (the pup always gets a bath after this one!) but it's a nice reminder how close I live to the beautiful, undisturbed desert!   I also get a little nervous about wildlife. I've yet to see a coyote, cat or javelina in the wash, but it's never very crowded with hikers and you never know, so I keep my eyes and ears open. I also generally leave my music off because it's multi-use so most often mountain bikers come up behind me and I like to know they're coming so I can move off. Friendly hikers and bikers as always though!

Fox Restaurants can do no wrong and North is another great argument for that. I've actually only ever been to the bar section, but I love the atmosphere and they serve the full menu, so why stray? The menu changes to keep up with the seasons, but all of their simple Italian dishes are consistently good and fortunately they always keep their zucca chips on! Comfortable seating on the patio, which faces the middle of the Kierland courtyard, can't be beat. They even have heaters for when the sun goes down and their house red, a delicious Montepulciano, keeps tempting you with just one more glass.

I love this hike - it's a little under 4 miles roundtrip going up and down and back and forth the whole time. If you take it at a decent pace (or take it twice), you'll get a great workout and wonderful views of North Scottsdale. I've never seen it "crowded" but parking gets busy and at times and you may have to pass (or be passed). All the other hikers are very friendly though!

I NEVER thought I'd pay this much ($90/month) but I can't quit this gym! The keys for me are their great yoga classes and instructors (just as good as any studio) and their three lap pools where I can always find a lane.  Being open 24 hours a day is wonderful and even when they adjust their hours on holidays, they're workable. At peak times, the parking lot can get crazy, but you'd never know once you get inside because it's so big, you don't have to wait for a machine or a shower.   It's very family friendly, which to someone without kids means crawling with kids during summers and other school breaks, but they're not allowed upstairs in the "gym" so it's just dealing with it at the pool or in the locker rooms.

I grew up down the street from this place and it's in a strip mall I visited frequently, but I never went. I assumed it was a mom and pop place with consistently good food (it outlasted many other businesses in the complex), but maybe a little boring. My sister suggested we go there for a family dinner and I was so surprised when I walked in! Finally, a reason to check that little box for "hipster" ambience on Yelp!   Every server who walked by greeted me and told me I could just take a seat, but unfortunately there was not a big enough table for my group, so we started the list, which just grew and grew as more people tried to get in for their pasties! They have great patio tables outside and long community tables and bar seats inside in their newly expanded space.   It was a little dark and loud once we finally sat - not good for an overly tired infant we had in tow or my dad who has a hard time hearing in loud settings. As I mentioned, all the servers were great, except for some reason, ours. She was very rushed and unfriendly unfortunately. But, despite that, I really liked the place!   They have a whole page for vegetarian pasties, but once I actually look, I wasn't too impressed that they rely heavily on Quorn (fake meat), but there were a few choices of just veggies and I could get the balsamic mushroom pasty and be happy every time! However, my mom got the same, but with chicken and thought the balsamic taste was a little strong. They ran out of their chips, so we had their coleslaw, which was good.   I definitely plan on going back, maybe trying their Tempe location for their happy hour!

European Wax Centers have the reputation of being the best because they are. I asked a friend who is a waxer about Brazilians and she said she doesn't even do them, just leaves them to Euro. This location runs like a well oiled machine and the entire staff is so professional and each room is clean, but welcoming.  When I first started, I bounced around and cared more about the time of my appointment than my waxer and they were all good, but I'm so glad I eventually got put with Erika and now adjust my schedule to get an appointment with her because her technique is fast and effective and chatting with her takes my mind off what's going on...ouch!   They initially got me in with a first wax free offer, good for all local residents, and they frequently have specials that allow you to pre-pay for 9 and get 3 free, so when I'm running low and they offer that again, I stock back up.

I loved this place when it opened! It's big, it has live music, good drinks and slightly above-par bar food. It draws in such a diverse crowd and everyone is there for a good time! It's a good people-pleasing place and I can usually get big groups of random friends, not just country fans, to go there.  However, it definitely peaked, got a little too trendy and big for its britches, if you will. Drinks got ridiculously expensive, there are covers some nights and it gets sardines-crowded. I think having competition in Cactus Moon next door come in brought them back down to reality because the last time I was at TK's, it felt more like the original Toby's I know and love.

TMI is one of those cute, little places in downtown converted from an old house, inconspicuously perched along the street - I almost missed it! It's a few blocks over from the art museum and was our choice to decompress after an afternoon there.   I was so jealous of everyone sitting in their awesome outdoor space, but it was mostly all taken and I wasn't dressed to sit outside as the sun went down anyway, but now I know! Inside, the tables were all open. We took a high top in the back and slowly watched the place fill up.   I wasn't impressed with our server. My first impression was that she was young, which is okay, but she was young and pretty disaffected, had no interest in being there, helping us or unfortunately checking on us, clearing the table or bringing the check in a timely manner. The food runners were at least friendlier, so I think she was just a fluke and hopefully just having an off day.  I didn't care too much for the two beers I tried - an Oak Creek hef and a Red Nectar amber (and obviously the server didn't help out much with the selection when asked) - but they have plenty of other options, although not as many on tap as I would have guessed. I tried my friend's White Chocolate and it was different but good.  The food was great. It definitely made up for so-so beer and a less than so-so server. We split Artichoke Heaven dip - nice, big chunks of artichoke with melted cheese and chiles, which they seem to use to add a little heat to a handful of their dishes - and the Veg sandwich with a salad. The dressing on the mixed greens was light and delicious and the veggie sandwich was perfect. The menu says it's roasted seasonal vegetables - mine had shitaki mushrooms, summer squash, red peppers - and the garlic goat cheese was an amazing spread.   Thumbs up, definitely check out the patio!

The staff is very friendly and I like the quiet, convenient location. My favorite thing is probably the fitness center, it's small and sometimes warm, but there's usually a cardio machine available and they all have individual TVs. The pools are nice too and they have monthly community events. I've not been, but I appreciate that they're offered.   So, why the poor rating? Well, because you get what you pay for and as one of the cheapest places to rent in North Scottsdale, you don't get much.   This is my third edit of this review and I'm trying to make it as concise as possible. Basically, the maintenance sucks and the disappointing quality of my unit combined with the unresponsiveness of the service staff just adds frustration and takes away the ease that is supposed to come with renting.   I've submitted more work orders in ten months at Broadstone Ancala - including four AC issues - then I have at any of the other communities I've rented at combined. I've also had more work orders ignored than I've submitted at any other place I've lived. Some issues I've fixed myself and some I've decided weren't worth the hassle or having to bug management to get them done. Others I've submitted multiple times before having it handled.   After my first poor review on Yelp regarding my second AC issue, I got a response from the property manager and she offered a nice apology and a concession on my rent, but so much has gone wrong since then (including being charged that concession the next month) that that is a distant memory and I cannot wait to get out of here! Unfortunately they require two months notice, so I've still got some time (and more maintenance issues, no doubt) to suffer through.

Great, friendly and efficient staff. They are good about setting up your next appointment and finding a time that works for you. UBS has a nice rewards program with freebies every time you donate and points to use to get movie tickets or other things, but just helping someone, getting a genuine thank you from the staff and the Famous Amos cookies make your short visit worth it! Save a life!

I'm not sure if Big Eye is my go-to sushi joint because it's convenient or because it's great, but I'll take both. It's small, quiet and dark and never crowded. They have a sushi bar and a handful of tables and usually one sushi chef and one server. I must say that the chef and the server that were there when I started going were great, but the mix of servers I've had recently are not. I'm hoping to go in and see Jason again soon.   The food is really good. They have some great specialty rolls with unique combos, but not an overwhelming menu with crazy choices. A good amount are tempura, which I usually avoid, but there are enough options that aren't fried. Keep in mind that spicy MEANS spicy at Big Eye!  The preparation isn't fast and with the usually empty dining room, it's easy to be annoyed, but it's worth the wait...just enjoy the time to relax! Their happy hour menu is small, but when I'm feeling thrifty is enough to keep me satisfied. I think they recently began to offer happy hour all day every day.   I take lots of friends and out-of-town guests here and I'm always happy to showcase it as my favorite local sushi place!

Walkable for me and my pup, so that's good, but it is dusty and the little grass that is there just isn't great. It's not a large space and does tend to get overtaken by large, rambunctious dogs. Usually all well-behaved, but I'm just a nervous dog mom who thinks my little guy is going to get pummeled!

While I can't review actual work, I can review my initial impression from a first visit.  He responded quickly, but Artie dismissed my plumbing issue and recommended I get a shower curtain that suctions to the tub (at least the visit was free, so I didn't have to pay for that awesome advice).    I'm not just a dumb girl and I had considered that was the problem, but I had called him based on Yelp reviews after I realized it was a much bigger issue and simply felt like he didn't listen to my concerns - unfortunately for him because it indeed WAS a big issue and he missed out!  It took three plumbers until I found someone with enough knowledge and motivation to find and fix my issues.  I recommend DrainPro!

Stopped in for a quick drink. I wanted tequila, but not a margarita and late-night, there was no drink menu around so I stuck with vodka soda, which ended up being a vodka water sans lime I sucked down before we got out of there! The mixed drinks were served in small plastic cups and the vinyl banquette we sat on was peeling like an old school bus seat! It has potential to be such a beautiful lounge with the dark spaces and open bar, but those details just made it seem cheap and uncared for. This has been on my check it out list for a while, but turns out I wasn't missing much!

I've heard great things and been wanting to try this place for a while. They had awesome pizza combinations, so I wanted to try something out of the ordinary - the Magical Mystery Tour, with mushrooms, feta, pesto, spinach and jalapenos and added sausage. It was good, but I wasn't blown away like I wanted to be (but I am looking forward to my leftovers)! The doughy crust has a swipe of garlic and a little extra cheese, but I think I prefer something thinner and a little burnt from a wood fire oven. I sampled my boyfriend's gluten-free crust and it was good for what it was, but he was missing out at least a little!   I was impressed by the big draft beer list including rotating seasonal taps. I would go back again for beer and maybe to try some apps.

Busy little breakfast place. Everyone I went with had savory breakfasts and they were very good. The sweet stuff looked good too. The coffee wasn't great, but they have a full specialty coffee menu as well. The service was lacking, but the food made up for it and I'd go back!

XO is my standard mom and sister nail date place. The staff is friendly to everyone, but even more so my mom because she is maybe their most loyal customer! We took a group in for my sister's pre-wedding day and they were great - opened early for us and let us bring in some refreshments to make it special.  They have a lot of stations and a lot of technicians, but do get very busy and sometimes have 30-60 minute waits. We usually make appointments, but unfortunately they don't really mean much! Best to go early to mid-day on the weekends (don't wait until the mid-afternoon) or afternoons during the week.   Even when they're busy, the service is great, they take their time and you get a really nice treatment! Of course they upsell, but the extras are lovely and they have some really skilled artists who will give you a cute little design!

When you think of a bar, this is it. It's old-school classy, intimate, clean and stocked. The friendly bartender and servers talk with friendly regulars who talk with anyone, well-dressed people unwind after work, old friends catch up, couples canoodle.   A client staying in McCormick Ranch told me about Downside Risk and I put it on my list to check out eventually. I figured it would be a good meet-in-the-middle spot when I was meeting a friend coming from Old Town, so we checked it out.   At 7ish on a weeknight, the bar stools were mostly taken, a few tables had guests and there seemed to be some sort of event going on in their private room. The large patio looks great with lots of casual seating and firepits. The bathrooms were clean and cutely decorated with the money scheme.  In our 20s, my friend and I were by far the youngest people in the place, but we didn't mind and the regulars didn't seem to either. At about 9:30, we were told the kitchen was closing and by 10, most everyone had cleared out and the staff was cleaning up. Not exactly their posted hours, but with no customers, I don't blame them.   If I lived closer, DR would be my MacLaren's...a reference that I'm sure is lost on the majority of the clientele...Cheers? Regal Beagle?

I'm not just hating because of the skimpy outfits (that most of the women don't have the body to pull off)...the food's just bad. I was excited to see something go in where Earl's was because it has a great outdoor space (even though it's right off the freeway) and went shortly after they opened, but was quite underwhelmed. I have heard they have a great TV set up to watch football games though.

It took me some time to get here after their open, but since I went a month ago, I've been back four more times - taking different people with me each time to experience their great food! The menu is full of unique food combos and everything I've had has been great, so I just want to keep making my way through it! The patio is right on Greenway, but it's still a nice place to enjoy one of their many margaritas! The staff is friendly and keeps their cool when it gets crowded on the weekend nights, but unfortunately was slow the last time I was in on a pretty dead Thursday...guess they're not a fan of patrons just drinking a few beers and watching a game.

Step away from the huss and fuss of Old Town and into this cool little place. Dark, with a great bar and casual seating in the bar area and a separate dining room, it definitely feels like stepping into a different world. It's a great place to enjoy a unique beer - I asked the friendly bartender to order for me and he guessed my go-to beer and gave me something spectacular in its place, if only I could remember which it was, maybe the Chimay?   It's a little off the beaten path and with great specials and what looks like a great food menu, and it was decently crowded on a Saturday afternoon but it was pretty empty when I went at 10 on a Friday, so start your night there and move on if you're looking for a traditional Old Town night or hang around to enjoy the relaxed vibe.

I really wanted to love this place when I walked in because it smelled heavenly, the menu had a lot of options I was interested in and everyone was so helpful and friendly. But, I was pretty disappointed with my Turkey and Avocado panini - very basic, unimpressive, pre-made with really cheap deli meat.  But, as I mentioned, the rest of the menu looked good, so I think I'll go back and give it another shot - probably sticking to vegetarian soup or salad options.

My office had our holiday dinner here on a Friday night. I loved the look of the place. We shared appetizers - the brie and the duck fat fries (sounds awful) were great. I had their house salad and a catch of the day served with drunk cherries and almonds and we shared some great sides and then some desserts. All the food was fantastic. I think my favorite thing was my drink though - the Honeybadger whiskey cocktail - yum! The service was really great as well. Our main server took great care of us and lots of runners helped throughout the night.  The restaurant was quiet and relaxed when we got there at about 7 and we had a good view of the bar, which slowly started to fill up and a DJ came in. By the time we left at almost 10, the consensus was that somehow it got colder and louder. Looked like a fun place to hang out on a Friday night, but it was a good time for our relaxed dinner party to leave.

I'm a fan! Plenty of rotating taps - they just did an Arizona takeover and have A LOT of (random) Arizona brews - and also bottles, all reasonably priced including their flights. This is a great place to watch a game or just catch up with friends. It's light and quiet for a bar. As I walked in last night, I realized it was all guys with the exception of two smart ladies at the end of the bar. Single gals, take the hint!

I finally took my first trip to Gadzooks and I will be back for sure! My sister recommended going early to avoid crowds, but I thought she was nuts because when we got there it was empty. By the time we left, the line was out the door! This place gets busy and the friendly, efficient staff is more than prepared to handle it.   We were greeted and the girl behind the counter explained the process to us - yes, just like Chipotle. Our pause was more just because there are so many choices! I went with 50/50 tortillas for my pork tacos, a little pico and sour cream and it was delicious. I wasn't hungry for a good 9 hours after that! Can't wait to try other varieties and of course, the enchiladas.

I went to this location when they first opened around Halloween and it was full of happy, friendly and creative staff helping last-minute costume makers put something together. I didn't find what I wanted there, but recently went back to scope out furniture, thinking a Goodwill in North Scottsdale would be the place to score some good pieces.   Their home section looks much like any other second-hand shop's and I was unimpressed, but my trip turned into one of their commercials and I found two cute dresses for $10 each and True Religions for $13 (if you want designer jeans, check the front "premium" racks, not the regular jean section). That score will keep me going back for more! The racks are huge, but worth the search. Come battle-ready on their monthly 50% off Saturdays.

This race was fantastic! For their inaugural event in Phoenix, they marketed the crap out of it and brought out a huge crowd. From the pre-race information via email to the expo to the actual event and post-party, it was very well run. The volunteers were all very helpful and positive. The 5k course was flat and fast but not spectacular - it just wove around a commerce park, including a silly little "run up, now turn around and run back" and was narrow at parts (particularly the beginning...hard to find space), but the 15k course looked nice.   As for the swag, a lot of people were wearing the jackets, but I'm not sure I'm a fan or that mine will get a lot of use. The finisher's mug was a great idea (and the pickup for them was again, very well organized). I expected lukewarm sludge, but the Ghirardelli hot chocolate was hot and delicious. The chocolate fondue was just not appetizing after a run so I skipped that and I'm not sure what to do with the mug now, but it was a detail I really liked. Hot Chocolate Run, I'm impressed!

I found The Nail Room because I was looking for a salon open on Sundays at 10. I swear I saw somewhere it said come on in, but when I got there at 10:20, the salon was almost empty and they said they had time for a pedicure but not mani. While I was weighing the option of finding somewhere else (I did come across a few others open early) or doing a quick paint myself, she said she could have two people work at the same time and do both. Yay! The salon was too cute to walk out of!  They had a great color selection to choose from and it was well organized so I could focus in on my pinks or purples. They have massaging pedicure chairs and the tubs had one-time-use liners. You can tell they take hygiene seriously...their tools were all sealed as well!   My techs were great...friendly, fast and I'm very happy with the finished product! There was no upsell pressure, just a menu on the side table to pick my services (with slightly increased prices from their website). The prices were what I expect from a salon, but the experience was a step above!  Definitely make an appointment! The place filled up by the time I left and they were asking walk-ins to come back at the end of the day!

I'm a fan of Boulders on Broadway, so when the manager mentioned that Spokes is the same owner, I wanted to check it out. The food was really great with more things on the menu I hope to go back and try soon. I thought it might be a carbon copy of Boulders, but the selections were different, but maintained the focus on upping the ante for bar food.   The servers were so friendly! On a slow night - there was some improv think going on in another part of the very large space - they chatted with us, welcoming us as our first time at the bar. Happy hour was $1 off all drinks, not amazing but they said perhaps food specials are in the works, but for the friendly service, good food and super convenient location, I'll be back!

So, I've never been, but my sister picked C2 Tactical to send the men in our lives to for Father's Day and they loved it! They did the simulation, which I found little about on their website, so maybe it's a hidden treasure or, I think, pretty new. There were four men and it was $55 each. The instructor wasn't 100% sure of how everything worked, so they're still working out some kinks, but they said it started pretty standard, but the scenarios they worked up to were really fun. They haven't stopped talking about the experience! Still doesn't make me want to go, but hey, if it's the kind of thing that floats your boat, check it out.

I checked out the reviews on here when trying to pick a place for my birthday. I was pretty hesitant, but I found myself in Tempe last night and decided to check it out to see first-hand if it would be birthday-worthy. It was pretty busy compared to some of the other places on Mill on a summer Thursday. The space was just kind of strange - small inside, but a good patio. There were hardcore country dancers on the small dance floor, and I was happy to see it because I got the impression it was just another bar using a gimmick to dress young servers in small clothes (they looked good!) but not really authentically country. Sounds like on the weekend it may change over, but on a weeknight, they were playing country music! Don't think I'll go there for my birthday - I already felt old there as it was - and if I need a country fix, I think I'm more likely to stick to the original - Toby's!

A great option for something different in the realm of quick-serve restaurants. The fish tacos were very filling and I had to take some of the filling out to be able to eat them, but they were LOADED with really cabbagy cabbage anyway, so I left most of that on the plates. The combination of the other flavors was good. The fish and chips was breaded v. battered, an interesting take, perhaps healthier? I will go back to try that and the sandwich. The workers were all helpful and excited to welcome new customers. It was busy mid-day since it's in a pretty commercial area. They're open til 9 and I hope they do well at dinner too! They serve beer and wine, so they probably do!
