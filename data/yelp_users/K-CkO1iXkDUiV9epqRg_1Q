At first look this place seems like a nice enough place to live in, I was wrong!!!! The washer stopped working and the dishwasher broke about 4 months into living here! It took them over a week to come and fix them, during that time I started seeing these big bugs all over my place as well.  I would leave my kitchen spotless and would come home to these bugs crawling about my counters, I put in an order for pest control and it took another week for them to come out and spray..after the spray they didn't tell me that I had a cockroaches in my pipes! They came a 2nd time and sprayed and told me I needed a 3rd spray the next week!! I had to move all of my stuff out to do the roach spray, all the leasing manager Nichole did was give me a "heartfelt" apology for my inconvenience and gave me a 25$ gift card for the movies!!! The management here is horrible and the maintenance, I've never been so disgusted do yourself a favor by not living here!

I LOVE BARROS. The best pizza hands down, I loved it so much the first time I visited AZ I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on in the pizza world! I have Barros every time I come to AZ now, it is tradition. Everything from the sauce and toppings to loving the crust, truly perfection!

This place is a gem! We went for my birthday dinner a few weeks ago and every dish and appetizer was delicious. My boyfriend had the ribs and swears they are the best ever, my salmon was the same way! This place is definitely a must, not too expensive but still nice and romantic as well.

So happy I found this little gem it is perfect I had the best chicken salad sandwhich and cheesy potato soup I've ever had! The bread could have been toasted or slightly softer but otherwise it was perfection, I will definitely be back! And the lady who took my order was as sweet as pie and a delight to listen to as she greeted customers, she knew them all by name!

This place is in my top 5 favorite places to eat in Scottsdale!!! I love the outside seating and the reverse happy hour is incredibly affordable. The food is phenomenal, we had the chicken quesadilla and the filet mignon tacos; never had anything like it!! This is all around a great place, service is always up to par and there's nothing bad on the menu (even though I haven't had every item) in my opinion this restaurant can do no wrong. I can't wait to go back, I'd eat there once a week if I lived in Scottsdale!!

I went here on a lunch date and fully enjoyed my meal as well as the view. Not only where these two key things worthy of a 4 star rating for my dining experience the waiter was extremely attentive even though when we walked in there was not a soul to be found in the front lobby. Once we were seated by a very kind waiter (don't remember his name, sorry!) this experience was a real treat! I will definitely be going back to this place the wrap I had was phenomenal, nachos were unexplainable! My vodka cranberry I ordered was good and strong again another key reason why this place was all around winning! Get the nachos, you won't be sorry!

I have never had any pizza, ceasar salad, or chicken parmesian as good as at Defalco's. Somebody once told me, "quality takes time" well let me tell you waiting an extra few minutes or so for this delicious meal was WAY worth it. The quality this place puts out is like nowhere else I've ever eaten, no other place that outshines it, can't wait to go back!

Love this little place for a quick and very affordable sandwhich! The chicken pesto is my favorite, always the perfect amount of pesto and chicken with tomato and lettuce. The service is great too, everyone here is so nice!

I just moved here from California and was happy to find this nail salon! They are quick, pleasant enough, and the gel manicures last me 2-3 weeks. I highly recommend their services in the manicure department, it is a very clean and spacious place. My only complaint is that their prices seem to be a bit high, but the quality is worth going for!

Fell in love with this place the instant I walked in. We sat at the gorgeous bar and enjoyed the view of the chandelier-like towers of every single bottle imaginable. We ordered the mac&cheese which is to this day one of thee most outstanding mac&cheeses I'll ever consume! The bread selection that came with and the martinis we ordered were also incredible. I was in awe of the gorgeous upstairs that had tables surrounding a shallow pool,  dining poolside at a steak house?   Coolest idea, this place is all around awesome!

My pup loves this place!! She had her nails trimmed and grinded down twice now here the prices are decent and the groomers are all very sweet. More importantly my pup loves the dipped bones and treats here, she doesn't mind having her nails trimmed when she gets a treat after! We are going go be regulars here:)

When we first walked in the place looked nice but it was completely empty on a Saturday afternoon, this should've been our first clue. After seeing the monkey bread as an appetizer online (which sounded delicious, or so we thought) and looking at pictures we gave it a try before our main meal. The order of monkey bread that we tried to eat was brought to us by a server who didn't seem crazy to be there himself. We finally asked him if this is how it was supposed to look and taste, he agreed that the bread was burned and actually tried to get the bread apart by hitting it on the plate right there at the table! The burger and sandwich we ordered were nothing special, the fries were by far were the best thing we ate which again were nothing special. I think this place has great potential if the owner would hire wait staff that was attentive and didn't make the kitchen look bad when trying to smash burned bread in front of customers. Just a suggestion. There won't be a second round for us at this place, I am stretching by giving it a two star rating!
