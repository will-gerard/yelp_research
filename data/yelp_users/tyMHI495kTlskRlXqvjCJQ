Attended a private event here and was not impressed. Maintenance guys were going through fixing and replacing lights during the event because they weren't checked in advance. The room looked extremely low budget and the drinks were so over priced that Mill Ave looks cheap. The food was also very blah in flavor and not much for the cost of the place. I'd recommend several other venues over this place such as the The Monorchid (which I'd only rate slightly higher for location but the food was really good), The Renaissance Phoenix Hotel at Westgate which did a great job for our 2014 Christmas Party, or the Wigwam Resort where Luke AFB held it's last Air Force Ball.

This is a nice little placed tucked away of the main thoroughfare. The food is good and the atmosphere is comfortable. I've been back a few times now with friends and always enjoy the experience.

I'm not usually a big coffee drinker during the summer, but after trying an iced white chocolate mocha I've been going back pretty regularly. It's a nice way to wake up in the morning.

I love this place. I worked at Red Robin 15 years ago and it's still one of my favorite burger places. I love the banzai burger best of all!

I absolutely love this place. I've always enjoyed a good show, but haven't been able to attend in years. Since moving to Phoenix a year ago though I have been to 3. The food is amazing and the shows have been too, especially Les Miserables

I was meeting friends here for breakfast Saturday morning and showed up a little late. They had already ordered. When I showed up the waitress asked what I wanted to drink, but didn't bring me a menu or come back for over 10 minutes. When she finally did it wasn't worth ordering since their food would be out way before my own. In the end I also got charged over $5 for a single glass of orange juice. This place is too expensive and the service isn't good enough to bother. There are plenty of other places to go for good food.

Having lived in Korea and Japan twice each I have tried a lot of authentic Korean and Japanese food. I have been to this place twice now to try it and haven't been impressed either time. The food is ok, but does not reflect the authenticity I expected from how they advertise.

When I first came to Phoenix a year ago I really enjoyed going out on the weekends to Westgate and usually ended up hanging out here at some point during the night. At that point it wasn't too bad, just mainly overcrowded, but it seems like every time I go here lately the place gets worse and worse. The employee's seem to always have a bad attitude and the bouncers are constantly looking for a reason to kick the guys out, as if the girls you're with are gonna stay after they eject you.

I've been here one a month for the last few months playing trampoline dodgeball. Its a great time and a good workout. Loads of fun if you can get together a few friends and go as a group.

I had the worst customer experience with the team and management at this location. The night manager was rude to us caused an issue when there wasn't one. As a result the food we got took over 15 minutes and was soggy, messy, and didn't look right. One bite let me know I shouldn't eat it and we threw away $25 worth of food. I will NEVER, EVER go back here. If you look at the other posts, you'll see I am not the first to have issues with this location and it's team. There is a McDonalds a few blocks away that will treat you way better.

I've gone here on 2 separate occasions and absolutely love their food. Last time I tried the burger called The Farm and have to say that it's probably the best I have ever had.

I was out this weekend at Whiskey Rose and not only were the drinks weak (I ordered a double and watched as they barely pored more that a single) but the bartender Savannah looked at me repeatedly over the 5 minutes I stood at the bar without ever asking what I wanted, but then as soon as her friends walked up next to me she stopped what she was doing to say hi and served them immediately. Even after that, she still didn't ask what I wanted, one of the other girls finally took care of me. Bad service and poor drinks. There are better places in Westgate to spend your money
