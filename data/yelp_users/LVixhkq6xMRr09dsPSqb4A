My recommendation: Stay close to your gate because their loudspeakers aren't very...loud  They have Free WiFi!  I've been to a lot of airports and PHX is definitely not one of my favorite.  Food, drink, and amenities at this airport are seriously lacking.  These are all important factors to consider when you have a delay or layover and want something decent to eat.  Stay away from eating in the sports bars in this airport.  But all of what I'm saying really probably doesn't really matter since who really has any choice in airport these days anyways!

My recommendation: water  We ordered buffalo wings and loaded potato skins as a "hold me over" food because nothing else in PHX airport looked open, but I'm not quite sure what we got.  The buffalo wings were chicken tenders coated with a really thin layer of really acrid/burn your mouth off buffalo sauce, and the potato skins were loaded with...oil.  Do yourself a favor and buy something from a vending machine if you're hungry.  Totally not worth the $30 that we spent here for two dishes + tax/tip...not even CLOSE.

My recommendation: rack of lamb!  When a good french restaurant does rack of lamb...YUM, don't miss it!  I ate here while on business in Scottsdale and had a very enjoyable time.  Service was a bit slower than I would have liked, but it may have been because I did not decide to have a glass of wine with my meal.  Excellent bread and spread though!  Petite Maison is tucked away on a side street and can be a little bit hard to find (hole in a wall).  Atmosphere was very accommodating though and both their indoor and outdoor seating are super comfortable.
