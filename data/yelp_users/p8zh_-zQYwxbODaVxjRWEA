Been here twice to get a pair of jeans and dress pants hemmed and also a shirt altered.  Great thing about this place - Got my dress pants back w/in 4 hours!  All my alterations came back w/ the correct measurements and can't even tell they alter it (meaning no stitching mess up).  The guy who helped me both times was very nice.

Been here 3 times and was disappointed after the 3rd visit.  I went to pick up my pants and it literally took them 10 mins to find my pants.  Strike 1.  After finding my pants the guy told me the pants had not been alerted yet.  Strike 2.  The guy apologized and said it would be ready in about an hour.  I went back 3 hours later and waited again for another 15 mins to get my pants back.   No customers ahead of me, just told me that it was almost ready.   Strike 3.

We went during happy hour.  Got the crazy, las vegas, spicy yellowtail, california roll, assorted tempura and tempera ice cream for dessert all for $40.  All the rolls were delish, but relatively small compared to other sushi places.  Tempura was more on the greasy side, but had a good variety (shrimp, carrots, green chili, onion, green bean and eggplant).  Tempura ice cream was great.  They give you 1 green tea and 1 vanilla covered with a lightly pound cake and tempura batter.  Only reason why I gave it a 4 star is the size of the rolls, other than that great tasting sushi!

I love how you can see everything going on in the kitchen.  The food is fresh and delish.  I just ordered breakfast and the best part of it was the pancakes!  It was fluffy and didn't taste like it came from a box.  The syrup they gave you is a bit watery but still good!  Hubby got the crab poboy and was surprised  how much crab you get!  Will definitely come back and try the lunch menu!

Came here after playing some disc golf...This place has the best calzones!!!  Their pizza is good also, but gotta go for the calzones!  You really get your monies worth for $8.  Their draft rootbeer is good, but you could taste a bit of a beer aftertaste.  Love the scenery with outdoor seating...looking at the fountain and green landscaping is so relaxing!

I can go on and on about Chad!  I can guarantee that he'll be the best DJ you'll ever work with!  We hired him for our st. pattys day wedding this past year and our guests are still talking about how much fun they had on our day.  If you want a creative, fun, not typical wedding entertainment,  Chad will be your guy!  He has many ideas to make your day fun and stress free.  When we first met him, right off the bat you could tell he is a very professional, organized, yet a kind hearted guy.  So easy to work with that you'll want to plan another event so you could hire him again.  We miss our day and the entertainment made our wedding day so memorable!!

This is the only authentic Thai place here in AZ!  I've tried other Thai places around the valley and nothing compares to this place.  Even though it's in a rundown area/plaza, it's worth eating here.  I love the pad see ew, pad thai, papaya salad, beef jerky, and best of all...Thai ice tea!!  The owner is from Thailand and is very friendly.  Even though it's a bit hard to understand him, he's pretty funny!

I had the best experience w/ Robert and Wendy!!!!!  They're sooooo awesome to work with!  They're funny, very personal, easy to work with, and most importantly, their food and cake was more than awesome!!!  Robert made our wedding day perfect!  We got sooo many compliments on the food (New York Loin & Chicken Picatta)...which we wanted!  He went beyond our expectations with the food and service.  We feel like we owe him more than what he gave us!!    At the last min. I've asked him if he could serve the bridal party our food first since I was concerned about time...he was right on it!  He saved us cake, saved us some macaroons (glad he did because they were all gone by the end of the night), he helped set up our candy bar, lighted the candles, set up the drinks/bar, etc....everything that goes into the reception, he did it!  I told myself that I would not go through this wedding planning again, but if I had any other big events like it, he would be my first pick.     Thank you so much again Robert, Wendy and your staff!!!  We love you guys!!!!!!!

Been here a few times and always end up getting the Chilean seabass!  Best tasting fish I ever had!  I believe it's about $40 just for the fish itself, but oh my it's worth eating good fish and having it prepared right.  I love the diff. bread options they give you off the bat- cheese, pretzel, mini baguete, and some other kind.  You have to order the sides separately, so whatever you get don't get the lobster mashed potato...not worth it.  Cant taste any lobster for that price!  Giving it only 4 stars since i haven't tried much of the other main entrees.

I've been here many times but will boycott this place now because of my last visit.   I was here during lunch time with my coworkers.  Food was good as usual but service was by far the worst we've EVER been treated!   When the 3 of us finished our meal we paid with 2 different credit cards.   When the receipt came back to us a gratuity was added.   We asked why was gratuity added and they said because they had to spilt up our checks with 2 different credit cards.  WTF... We never have this issue anywhere we go!   It wasn't worth the time to fight this since we had to get back to work anyway.    After the stupid gratuity issue...my coworker had leftovers to bring back, so he grabbed 2 chopsticks to go. One of the waitress saw him grab 2 so she grabbed 1 of the chopstick from his hands and told him that he only needed 1 chopstick!  WOW!  We were so shocked that we had nothing to say to her.    Bye bye Sushi Ken!!!  NEVER AGAIN WILL I OR MY COWORKERS BE BACK FOR YOUR RUDE SERVICE!!!!!

Yes it's a bit weird that you have to go through the bigger dog area to get to the smaller dog area but overall it's clean and got a good amount of shade.

New owner, no more mean lady!  I boycotted this place because of the previous owner, but back to give new owner business!   Good soft  chewy boba, yummy drinks, good customer service!  Got the fresh watermelon slush and thai tea slush - 2 for 2....Score!!!

It was girls night out for us and been wanting to try this place.  I ordered a chicken dish and  took a bite and noticed something didn't taste right.  I pulled it out of my mouth and found a string of metal!  I returned the dish and complained to the waitress.  She looked at it and said, 'oh it's probably just the piece from the sponge they use to clean the pots!'   By then I was completely sickened by the fact she said it was from a sponge!  They didn't charge for the dish, but won't go back because I'm a complete germaphobe!    Ugh...feel like throwing up just writing this review!

This place use to good, but they just recently CUT BACK on everything!  First of all, they're going cheap on their drinks!  I normally get the snow drinks and this last time, I could NOT taste the flavor at all!   All I tasted was the sweet milk and ice...literally!  Secondly, they just started to not hand out the punch cards anymore.  They still accept them, but no longer hand them out....which is fine.  Lastly, the credit card machine has been down for a few months now.  I personally think they're trying to get away from using a credit card machine.  It doesn't take long to have someone to come out anf fix this machine.  Don't put a sign out that says credit card machine is currently out if you're not going to fix it.  Just tell  your customers that you no longer accept credit and cash is only acceptable.    I'm boycotting this place until they fix something.

This place is the bomb!  Love coming here during nice weather months where you can sit under a huge tree with shades...kinda like a nice picnic afternoon.  I usually get their chicken tenders with fries!  This is the best and juiciest tenders I've ever had.  It's panko fried tenders, so not too greasy.  Also had their burgers, fried zucchinis, salads, ahi sandwich...all delish!  Don't get the bbq stuff here.  Since I'm comparing it to their other resturant, Joes bbq, it's dry and doesn't taste as fresh.  To top it all their milkshakes are soooo good!  Especially the strawberry one.  You can taste small chunks of strawberries, which I love!  Plan on waiting in line during the busy lunch and dinner hours...especially on the weekends.  It's all worth the drive and wait!

I always end up getting their Mido roll!  Not a big fan of their deep fried stuff.  It always taste like it was left out for awhile or bad oil.  Also like how they serve you miso, salad, and edamame right off the bat.

It's so worth the time and money to hire these guys.  Ronnie and Miles were efficient and moved my furniture as if it was theirs.  They came early, introduced themselves, and did what they had to do.  Jose also did a good estimate on the time and went under the expected time it would take 2 guys to move my belongings.  I know we'll be moving again in the near future and will definitely use GYMO again!  Thanks!

This place has the best bbq pork!  It's tender, juicy and I love the fact that it's not that red color artificial stuff they normally use.  Also loved their roast pork and duck...so tender and flavorful!

Wow oh wow!  Came here for my sister's 30th and it was worth it.  I got the 3 course tasting menu ($55) and hubby got the 5 course ($100).   We were both satisfied by the time we left.   By the time we left neither of us was full nor hungry.  It was an exciting experience cuz you didn't know what you're going to get with each course!  All courses came with a dessert and that was even delish!  This is probably the freshest sushi you'll ever have in AZ.  Even though this isn't a typical sushi restaurant the experience and taste was well worth the money.

John was so friendly and approachable to work with.   He did an amazing job installing 80% sunscreens on 8 windows in about an hour.  Total cost was $700 plus $111 SRP rebate.   He even helped us with the rebate form and all we had to do is fill our info. and send it in.   Would highly recommend John to anyone looking for sunscreens!

Made reservations here and by the time we got there, they had messed up and couldn't get us in whatsoever!  The general manger and hostess were the bitchest and rudest service I've ever dealt with.  Even if they apologized or somehow showed that they cared, then it would be fine....but NOPE not even a sorry was ever mentioned!!!  Even though this place have gotten good reviews, I will never come back to give it a try.  Sorry Gordon Ramsey, you guys have just lost quite a few customers and will definitely spread the words to our friends and families!!  Suckaaaa!

One of my favorite places for fast sandwiches salad soup combo.   Price has gone up but for $8.79 you can choose any 2: whole sandwich, salad, or soup.  They have a wide variety to choose from and it always taste good and consistent.   Only reason I give it a 4 star is location and they don't open on Sundays.

Came here for my aunt and uncle's 50th anniversary dinner party.  We were placed in the kitchen view private room and service was great (with the exception of...read my 2nd paragraph) and food was more than delish!  For appetizer we had crispy shrimp, calamari and meatballs.   Main entree got the filet with creme brulee corn and asparagus. For dessert got the double pound cake with strawberries.  Everything tasted great!  Crispy shrimp was lightly deep fried with sweet chili sauce on top.  Calamari was also lightly deep fried and didn't taste fishy.  Meatball was surprisingly very good and juicy.  I got the filet cooked medium rare and it came out perfect!  This was a big chunk of meat for a filet!  Creme brulee corn tasted more like a dessert!  I wasn't too crazy with the dessert since the pound cake took over the poor strawberries.    Only reason I gave it a 4 star was because my cousin had asked for a wine list and they gave him the expensive list.   He thought that this was the only list they had and had spent $200 on a bottle that typically cost about $60.  We later found out there was a cheaper wine list out there!   I dunno but felt like the waiter did this on purpose to cheat us.  Why can't you place all wine on 1 menu rather than 2?  I thought this was a bit shady but then again we could've asked if there was a cheaper wine list.

I compare all snow to Class 302 which is located in Rowland Heights, CA.  So we got the mango and coconut snow in the monster size..have to admit, it's comparable!  The only thing it doesn't have that Class 302 has is the fresh fruit and the presentation.  I'm not a big fan of the plastic cups.  Snow served on a plate is easier to eat and share with.

I like to give business to family owned places.   This place is a bit small but they have your basics party supplies.  It's actually cheaper than Party City which is a plus!  Only reason why I have 4 stars because I wanted my balloons at 3pm but weren't ready when I got there at 3:20... not a big deal but expected them when I was a bit late.   I would come here again.

Another sushi place to add on my list!   Service was great (water was always filled and food came out at reasonable timing), everything tasted fresh, non greasy, and light.  I love the fact of having clear pickled ginger rather than that red food coloring crap with my sushi.   Pretty reseasonable prices.... there were 7 of us and we ended up spending $150.  And for it being located right in downtown Phx, finding parking around the area wasn't bad at all.

Got their specialty Ramen and it was decent for $7.  They give you a good amount of meat, but my broth was salty as heck.  Green tea cheesecake was good, but a small round 4" for $6!?  Also got a glass of water and the glass was dirty.  You could see lip marks and residue all over...gross!  Service was alright...it seemed like they waited on you based on how much the waitress can handle.  There was a group of 8 that came in after us and waitress told them it was going to be about 20 mins, yet there were 3 big tables available.  I would give it another try.

We decided to try this place out since Chickfila is closed on Sundays.  Surprisingly it was good.  Got the 6 ct meal:  lightly breaded not too greasy juicy chicken, skinny crinkle-cut fries, very buttery Texas toast and typical cole slaw.  It also comes with a light cajan sauce dip.   A good alternative to chickfila especially on Sundays!

First time here and got the mother earth bowl and chicken and...yum did it have good flavors!  Only issues I had was I left still hungry after $15 worth of lunch.  I'm a petite person that can eat so a bit disappointed on the amount.  Other than that probably will be back if I'm ever on this side of town.

Just opened and they still need to improve.   Came here on a Sat. late morning and they did not have clam chowder nor garden veggie soup ready.  Decided to get the chicken noodle and came out luke warm.  I'll probably give it another try in a a year or so when they can figure out how do do it right like Paradise.

So after getting horrible service the first time around I told myself I wouldn'tcome back here until they can figure out how to get their stuff together.    So I lied and decided to come back here because it was on my way to work and I was hungry for a bagel and cream cheese.  I ended up getting my bagel to-go so I can chow it down at work.  After spreading the cream cheese on took a bite into it I tasted something awkward in my mouth.  I pulled it out and found about 2 inches of a piece of plastic in the bagel!!!!!  I ended up throwing it away and was starving the whole morning.  So I will definitely NOT come back here EVER again!!!  This place needs to close down and figure this 'restaurant' business before it opens to the public!

Yippy finally a good snow place in AZ!  Their snow texture was creamy and fluffy... just how I like it!  Almost as comparable as the snow in CA!  We'll definitely be coming here quite often especially now that the summer is coming!  So a bunch of my family came at 7pm (not knowing what time they closed) and didn't look like they were open.   When they saw a bunch of us they told us to come right in!   They were so nice and friendly.  Apparently this is a soft opening (current hours are 12pm to 6pm until the grand opening of 5/9).  They mentioned 1st 100 people on 5/9 will get a buy 1 get 1 free deal.  This is a family business and love to support the small businesses.

First time doing microdermabrasion and loving it!   Kelsey did such a great job doing the treatments on my face.  I can't wait to go back in 2 weeks.   I have acne scaring and mild breakouts so I'm hoping this will work.     Kelsey if you're reading this I totally forgot to tip you!!  Argggg

This place makes Republic Ramen look bad!   Got the miso ramen, Japanese chicken wings and octopus balls.  Ramen tasted fresh and not like a can of soup full of sodium!  Wings were good but nothing too special other than they're pretty good size.  The octopus balls is like potato balls with a piece of octopus...not too bad.   Would definitely come here again.
