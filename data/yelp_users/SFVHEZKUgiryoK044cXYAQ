MAGGOTS!!!! I wish I could leave a -5 rating on here for Chen & Wok; we have eaten takeout for here for years and always enjoyed it for our greasy Chinese fix. But last night we found fu¢king MAGGOT in our broccoli. We took it back, got our money and raised a huge stink...other diners also came up to get their money back. That is by far the MOST disgusting experience I've ever had from eating out and I worked in food service for years so I've seen some pretty nasty things. NEVER EVER EAT HERE!!!! I will be calling the health department on Monday. I couldn't believe the girl said, "Well it was probably just something from the vegetables but I'll give you your money back anyway." Seriously?! It's a fu¢king MAGGOT!!!! So for anyone considering enjoying good ole Chen & Wok, let me say it again....MAGGOTS!!!!!!!!!!

Amanda and Alexis came to clean our house today and they were very prompt, polite, quick and thorough. Will definitely continue using Wave in the future!

I've been to this little gem several times now and I must say I'm in love. Plenty of options vegetarian options for me as well as vegan options for my boyfriend. The food is gourmet, the atmosphere  is rustic and eclectic while maintaing a very clean feel, the owner is lovely and congenial. And OMG I am addicted to their coffee!! The iced almond milk latte is the best in Phoenix. Do yourself a favor and enjoy a nice brunch here :)
