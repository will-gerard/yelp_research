This is a large church, so if you're looking to come in and not be noticed you'll be fine.  The music is loud, but fairly well mixed.  I personally think the vocals are hard to pick out.  It's more moddern type worship and suites the younger crowd very well.  Older individuals may not feel very comfortable during the music, but the sermons are excellent, challenging, and will speak to all types of people.  If you're in the area, give it a try.

The best live music venue in the area.  I LOVE live music while having some beers, and I really love live metal.  The stage is large enough for most 4 to 6 piece bands, and there is plenty of room for a crowd up front.  They don't allow moshing, but you can bounce all night long.  The sound is excellent for the size of the venue and you can see the band from pretty much anywhere inside.  There's also a patio to get away from the noise if needed, and you might even find a taco stand to satisfy your midnight munchies.  Excellent drink selection, and awesome crowds.  I'll be back here to get my live metal fix over and over.

Tired of eating low quality birthday cakes with nasty frosting?  Then try something new and get a stack of cookies from Chocolate Start Bakery.  These cookies are pretty decent sized and so tasty that you'll forget about cake the second you bite into one.  They remain soft and moist even after a few days.  You'll find there are a nice selection of unique flavors that you can't get anywhere else and you won't have an issue finding something you like.  If you're not a fan of cookies, then this place will make you one.

The best gun store and indoor range I have ever been to, and I've been to a lot. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and pretty laid back. They carry a large assortment of fire arms, including a wide variety of AR-15. If you come to the range more than a couple times, it's worth getting a membership so you can shoot for free, bring guests, and get a discount on ammo. The let you rapid fire here which is important for those looking to work on those skills.

I might be harsh on this place, but I fully enjoy the Kiltlifer they make here.  The problem with the restaurant, is the price.  I've been here for lunch a few times and struggle to find anything worth eating that's less than $12.  To me that's too much to pay for lunch in a place like this.  The food is good, but not $12 good.  You're better off coming here to drink and watch the scenery than eat.

I really love the sushi here. It's a very modern, Americanized, sushi experience. However, the quality of fish is excellent so if you're in a more traditional sushi mood you will enjoy the toro, yellowtail, albacore, and salmon. But if you're ready to utilize all of your taste buds they have some of the most delicious and creative rolls in the city. "I love my ass" and "tastes like my ex girlfriend" are favorites of mine, but I would highly recommend starting with a spicy tuna hand roll. When I lived in Vegas I was a regular here, and when I come back to visit I try to make a point to hit this place at least once.

A small local dive bar with cheap drinks and karaoke.  You may find it entertaining to listen to the same people murder pop songs over and over but don't expect a giant menu or a huge selection of beers.

Best sushi in the area.  Small venue but very comfortable and feels high class.  Service can be slow when busy but the sushi is worth the wait.

I suppose if you like quilting you will find enjoyment here.  Lots of supplies for people in this type of hobby and it's not very busy so you don't have to worry about long lines.

Some of the best pizza and bread sticks I have ever had.  Better to take it out or have it delivered.  The atmosphere is rough and the salad bar was an afterthought.  But I could eat that pizza again.

Another trendy sushi resurant and bar.  This one is a lot of fun on the weekends when the place is packed.  The quality of fish is on par with most high end sushi places, and they offer a full list of different Shochu which was a new expereince for me.  I've always enjoyed sake, especially nigori, but have never given Shochu a try.  A lot of it tastes like whisky without the burn.  It's not cheap, but very good, and goes well with the sushi.  I really enjoyed the butterfhish tataki, and recommend giving it a try.

Can't go wrong with The Crazy Chicken, really.  Their marinating sauce is unique and tasty.  When I have family in town I always get a meal with some sides and everyone ends up happy and stuffed.  They have sweet potato fries which are much better if you ask for them well done.  The burritos are excellent if you don't feel like making your own chicken tacos, and their selection of sauces goes perfect with any of their meals.  I could eat here once a week.

I LOVED this place, but I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I'm a large person and the servings are really small.  The service wasn't the best, but it could be more related to the day and time I ate here.  I fully enjoyed the crispy pancakes, but was still hungry after I finished, so I finished my wife's CANGREJO BENEDICT MOFONGO which was one of the best things I think I've had in my entire life!  I was really angry that I didn't order that.  Although it was a very small serving, the flavors came together so nicely that I could have ordered two dishes if I felt like spending some cash.  The Bar + Bistro is a perfect place to finish up your weekend in Vegas.

They try to be like In-N-Out, even down to the color scheme, but the burgers taste very different.  They offer cajun fries which have some extra seasoning, and if you ask for your fries "well done" they don't come out as soggy.  But if you're going with someone else, then one order of fries is all you'll need.  They give everyone huge helpings of fries and I'm never able to finish a single order so I just share it.  The burgers are excellent and the one thing that sets this place a part is the option to get fresh jalapenos on your burger.  Don't forget about breakfast!  This is where In-N-Out fails.  The breakfast burgers are great after a night of partying.
