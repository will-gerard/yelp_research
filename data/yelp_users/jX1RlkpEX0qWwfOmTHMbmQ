Fresh soups, sandwiches salads & more, all made quickly with fresh quality ingredients.  All the sandwiches I have ordered here are consistently good.  The bread is always soft, the lettuce crisp, and the fillings tasty and ample.  I come here often and have yet to have a bad sandwich.  The potato salad is crisp and fresh, but not drowning in mayo or dressing.  To some people this could seem bland, however they do a good job at "dancing the line" between too much & too little.  A great place for a quick lunch or an impromptu meeting.  The offer dine-in, take-out & catering.

More than just a high end grocery store!  Since they also do catering they have a full line of food you can take home, or carry out to the shaded patio area to enjoy.  They have a top notch salad bar and desert counter, as well as everything from appetizers, sushi and entr√©es.  Be sure to walk around the store because in the opposite end of the store is a real brick oven pizzeria, as well as other italian delights.  A good place for an impromptu lunch, and to pick up those few items you need at the grocery store.

Got a great pizza deal I couldn't pass up. ...However sometimes you get what you pay for.  Although the price was right, the pizza was not.  Crust was a bit heavy and reminded of Bisquick.  The cheese was tasty, however the sauce was so sparse, they should have just left it off completely.  This "pizza snob" will not be returning for these pies...

If you build a good sandwich, they will come...If you build a good sandwich anyway you want it, more will come...  Fresh and creative, these sandwiches are fast and delicious.  The sandwiches are prepared fresh to order and the staff are eager and willing to make it anyway you want it with no complaints.  Did I mention free drink refills ALL DAY !!

Unlike all the burger chains that been popping up around Phoenix, these are Real flame-broiled burgers, not the smoosh it on a griddle until all the flavor has burnt away meat pattie. Not to mention they deliver it at a reasonable price!  My co-workers and I have this one on or regular lunch rotation list!

I have never had a lunch that cried out for something more...Just anything, italian dressing, mayo, mustard...It was just bland.    Tried a Super Sicilian, that came out more tasting like a warm bologna sandwich, and cold cuts barely covered about 1/2 of the already narrow bun.  The bun was also completely covered with sesame seeds, which just overpowered anything that actually got into the sandwich.  My guest tried another sandwich had similar complaints...

Although labeled as a "pizza" place, this is one of the best rounded Italian restaurants in downtown.  The pizza is great here, but it doesn't stop there.  With calzones, pasta, sandwiches, salads and desserts, there is something good here for everyone.  Pizza is available by the slice in both thin crust and Sicilian, however I prefer my pizza fresh, so I order a 10" for myself.  My favorites are the Bianca, and the Carnivori.  The sandwiches are large, and enough for even the hungriest of men, but I suggest having it on the homemade focaccia bread.  The salads are huge and big enough for sharing or you'll have some to save for later.  Parking can be an issue here with only a few spots out front...But us regulars know about the hidden spots in the alley behind the building...

The place to go if you need supplies for any party or event.  They have everything from balloons, napkins, toys and party favors, to wedding supplies and costumes. They have everything well organized by events and themes.  If you want a Spider-Man or Disney princess themed party, they have everything you need.  WARNING...You may catch yourself playing with all the little party favor toys they have in bulk bins!

If you like your gyros full of meat and not lost under a salad, then this place is for you!  This is the real deal, the gyro meat is tender and full of spices, and cut fresh from the spit to order.  Not the reheated or grilled meatloaf some places try to pass off as gyro meat.  The pitas are warm and are more than able to keep the abundance of ingredients in check.  The tzatziki sauce is a bit runny but with lots of dill...Restaurant is always clean and staff is friendly.  I have been coming here for years, and will continue to do so.

Food with an artsy twist!  Me and my co-workers eat here regularly, and it is always good food.  They have some interesting combinations on menu, and all are good.  A word of warning though...They put their own spin on everything they make, so enjoy it for what it is, and do not spend your lunch trying to compare to other places, for they are in their own class.    For example, they last time I was in I ordered the Gryos sandwich.  At first glance, I looked at this pita stuffed with only a few strips of meat and what appeared to be an over abundance of vegetables.  After diving into it, I quickly learned to appreciate the sandwich for the art it was.  The flavors were well balanced and every little ingredient complemented the others in a very palate pleasing way.  For the little kid in you, try the Grown-up Grilled Cheese Sandwich which comes with a cup of tomato soup that is not what you grew up with.  The soup is lighter than you would assume with a very bright tomato  taste and a good balance of herbs and spices.  The sandwich is a decent blend of cheeses with something they call proscuitto bacon, and the sandwich is good, however, as any good italian (or cook) will tell you, proscuitto is meant to be served cold or at room temperature (with very few exceptions), and in my opinion, this use fails where a simple piece of regular bacon would shine.

Vegetarian South Indian Buffet...  I've been a fan of Indian food since my first taste of Aloo Gobi, and being a west-sider, I am very rarely in this part of town, however this little gem is worth the trip.  Being in the East Valley for a meeting with my vegetarian co-worker, we couldn't pass on trying out this place.  After one trip to the buffet, we were not only hooked, we were already full.    I have  been to a lot of Indian buffets around town, and this one introduced me to a lot of new items, and tastes, I had never experienced before.  Being strictly vegetarian (and some vegan), you did not have all those "regular" dishes you find in the other buffets (tandori chicken, lamb curries..etc.), so they were replaced by new and exciting delicacies.  The mushoom tikka masala was so go, I could have pulled my chair up to the buffet and stayed for the day.  We were also introduced to Dosai, or rice crepes, this variety filled with potato and onion.    If you happen to find yourself in this part of town, a visit here is something you will not regret.  OH...One last thing...  You know how they say that you can tell an ethnic restaurant is good if "they" eat there.  Well during my visit, ALL the other guests were Indian!      'Nough said!

Wedged between Durant's and Schlotzsky's on Central Avenue, this trendy cafe caters to both the business crowd, and the hipsters.  The food is always fresh and delicious, and the place is always clean. Being a popular downtown lunch destination for the nearby business crowd, this place can fill up fast for lunch time, so plan to arrive before the noon to avoid the rush.  The salads and sandwiches are the popular items.  The salads are filled with fresh, and sometimes interesting combinations, and are large enough to satisfy even the heartiest of appetites.  The sandwiches are made fresh, with a variety that runs from a three cheese sandwich, to burgers, pot roast, and even lobster rolls.  If you are looking for a place to satisfy several different palates, this place has something for everyone.

Best Irish fare in Phoenix !  The only REAL Shepherd's Pie in Phoenix made with lamb, not ground beef, which is the most savory pie I have ever had.  It has ruined me for all all others.  Throw in a pint of Magner's Cider and don't forget the bread pudding!  The food alone is worth the trip here!

This factory is no hero to this Yelper.  I was craving a sub, so I gave this place a chance.  I immediately went for the Italian sausage parmigiana. The good news was it was fast, but the good news ended there.  First the rolls are very narrow and completely covered with sesame seeds, which was then covered with cheese and MICROWAVED!!! rendering the roll tough and chewy.  Then there was the total absence of any tomato sauce at all, which is implied by the term parmigiana!  The "Italian sausage" was also very bland and lacked any character at all.

Indian buffet for $7.99...How can you go wrong?  This small restaurant is tucked away in a well stocked Indian market on 7th Ave, south of Virginia Avenue.  The buffet is small, and the food is well prepared and tasty.   Most of the main dishes have been the same the few times we have been here, but on the other hand, you can count on your favorites being there next time you go, and being sure that you can get your fix.  The Chicken Tikka Marsala is my favorite, along with the vegetable pakoras, and of course, the freshly cooked naan brought to your table.  I have never been a fan of samosas, however my vegetarian friend tells me they are the best around. My only complaint would be that the gulab jamun are not served warm.  If you are looking for a classy Indian restaurant to bring a date, this is not it.  It is simple place with the most basic of tables and decor.  If you are looking for a good Indian food at a very good price, then you need to try this hideaway.

This restaurant / brew pub with it's use of fresh ingredients and creative combinations, will keep you coming back.  Having been here several times, my favorite is the Calvado sandwich.  It is a wonderful combination of sopressata, provolone, artichokes & roasted red peppers on focaccia, served with a fresh salad of assorted greens.  Set-up in a converted house (which just adds to the ambiance) means that there is limited seating indoors, so get there early! There is a small patio with tables out front if the weather allows.  The place shares a parking lot with several other restaurants, which means that parking can sometimes be a challenge.

The best of the dollar stores!  Always clean and we'll stocked.    Like any of the dollar or 99 cent stores, the store can be completely hit or miss, but if you are planning any party or event, come here first, and then go to the other stores...

In a word...AVOID!   Food was very bland and tasted like it had actually been made in a wok in New York and shipped via bike messenger to Arizona.  Egg rolls and rangoons were stale and had almost no filling.  Boneless spareribs were black around edges, extremely hard and had almost no flavor.  Fried rice was over cooked, and was little more than white rice with a bit of soy sauce.    Although the dumplings appeared homemade, they were very bland, and shriveled like they may have been reheated.  They were not even folded like a proper Chinese dumpling but simply folded in half.  Food at local cheap ($5) Chinese buffets are far better than anything I got from here.  I have noticed that the reviews for this place used to be excellent, at least until the last few months.  This usually indicates new owners, cutbacks or a staff that just doesn't care anymore.

Another one of those all-u-can-eat buffets.  This one has lots of choices...But not any really tasty ones. Like most of these places the secret is to find the items they do best and stick with those, however I failed at that, but it was not due to lack of trying. Although a lot of things looked good, they were either just bland, dry, or just not good.   The one exception I found were the Gyoza (potstickers, dumplings or what ever this place chose to call them).  Although they are the same as served at a lot of the others chinese buffets, this one actually did them right...Not dried-out or deep fried. There are plenty of more chinese buffets in the desert, keep looking!

Craving an east coast style sub, then this is your place!  Freshly baked bread and cold cuts sliced to order with your choice of toppings, or just try it "Mike's Way!"  The only place I have found that has cherry pepper relish (a staple on east coast subs), which gives it the "taste of home" for this former east coaster.  The place is located with several other restaurants and parking can be a challenge if you don't get there early.  Reward program available...

Went here with some friends who wanted to play bingo on saturday night.   We were there for the Eclipse Bingo which started at 11pm.  It cost $12 for 11 games, and the room was almost completely full.  Unfortunately the jackpots for most of the games were only $150 (split by all winners), with two games at $300 and one at $500.  Up on the screens (and on the website) were all these huge bingo jackpots (one was like $59,000) but they were not at this bingo session, nor was there any explanation on when and where those jackpots are given out.  If you are going with a group of friends, it can be fun with the music pumping, but if you are going to try to win money, this is really not the place.  The brief time I walked around the casino, there were absolutely no open machines, and people waiting for them to open.  Not to mention, all the machines I saw were video machines...not a real "reel" slot machine in sight.

Custom designed 11" pizza for only $7.75 with as many, or few toppings as you desire, including premium ingredients like feta cheese, fresh mozzarella, capicola, Kalamata olives and more....At no extra charge.  This is a very thin crust, but not a cracker crust, but thinner than I would usually prefer, however the toppings more than make up for it.  They also do custom salads and take out.  The place can fill up quickly and there have been long lines, especially around noon.  The good news is that there are several other places to eat at this location if the line is out the door and you prefer not to wait.

If you want the most authentic and delicious  pizza in downtown Phoenix, this is the place!  I grew up in an Italian community outside of Boston and never had any pizza to compare with their pies.  Real thin and slightly chewy crust pizza made with premium ingredients, not the crispy and burnt crust they serve at other popular pizza joints.  Place is spotless and staff is friendly and welcoming.  You can't go wrong with the Italian Stallion pizza.  Made with fresh prosciutto, sopressata, pepperoni and Schreiner's Sausage. It is worth the mile walk, both ways, I make at least once a week.  Worth your time to try, even if it is only to say you've had real authentic Italian pizza...

I was pressed for time today so I ordered the Calzone (Pizza Fritti) to go.  From the moment I opened the box, I could tell this calzone, was different from any other one that I have had in the past.  Unlike other calzones that you get in other "pizza" restaurants, these are fried, instead of baked, using the same "certified authentic" dough used to make their wonderful pizzas.  The result is a soft and chewy dough that holds the fillings in check, and is a delicacy all on it's own.  The calzone comes filled with salami, ricotta cheese, house-made mozzarella, and San Marzano tomatoes, all playing together in harmony as they dance across your palate.   And although not listed on the menu, mine contained a few ripe olives which at first surprised me, but added a whole new complexity to the experience.  La Piazza Locale continues to impress me, and if YOU only remember one part of my review during YOUR visit, it is this:  "Experience as written!"   A lot of thought went into the items on the menu and they are beautifully crafted with flavors in perfect balance...Do not mess with perfection.

Fast and Fresh Greek Fare in Phoenix.  Me and my coworker stopped in to try the new location in Phoenix.   I ordered the Gyro Pita, which was filled with a tender and flavorful beef & lamb mixture with a good spice mixture that enhanced the meat without being overpowering, which is a common problem at greek places.  The pita was fresh and warm and filled with a good amount of meat, and not buried under a lot of lettuce and other "fillers." French fries were fresh, hot and crisp.  All the ingredients were very fresh tasting and lacked the "reheated" fare you get at other places. Although I would have preferred a bit more tzatziki sauce, it was still one of the best Gyros I have had around downtown Phoenix in a long time.  My coworker, a vegetarian, had the falafel and found them very flavorful and light, and had similar comments about the fresh taste of his lunch.  We will be adding this place to our normal lunch rotation.

Is six inches enough for you?  The quality is there, but delivering it is something else entirely.  A new store opened near me, so I finally decided to give them a try.  They offer six inch "gourmet" sandwiches for around $5-7 (with tax), no sides included.   For my first test, I went simple with the Italian and the Meatball sandwiches.  Now the meatball sandwich was hot with melted cheese, but the amount of sauce was seriously lacking, coming across as no more than a simple condiment.  The meatballs were flavorful, but dry, and the pitiful amount of sauce supplied could not even begin to bring these things back to life. You could tell the "meatballs" had never even touched the sauce before they came together in the sandwich.  I can't tell you if this is normal, since it was my first visit, but the attempt was not good enough to get me back..  The Italian was a failed attempt altogether, and I will clearly blame the preparer, and not the restaurant.  As in most sandwich places, as you move down the line, you are asked what you would like on you sandwich.  I told him, lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, oil and herbs, which he repeated back to me to confirm.  The problem was when I got home the only one of the ingredients that made it to my sandwich was lettuce.....NO tomatoes, onions, pickles, oil or herbs.  I had places that made mistakes with my order, however not this bad, and not with me standing right there at the specific time telling him what to put on the sandwich.  Maybe that is why the condiment area is hidden behind a wall, so you can't see what they are, or are not doing.  First impression...not impressed with either food or staff...

I was very excited to finally see a decent pizza place in this area!  The "design your own" pizza craze is hot in Phoenix and this chain, although being the third entry in the field, are gonna make a race of it.  You get an 11 inch pizza for only $7.47 with as many or few toppings of your choice for one low price!  Or, if you prefer just a cheese pizza, ask for the "maddy" for only $5.97.  They even have a "mini" size for those with smaller appetites.  After selecting the size of your crust (and yes, they do have gluten-free available), you have your option of several toppings, including a rich tomato sauce, BBQ, and others.  As much as I wanted to stay traditional, the pesto sauce was calling my name (and I highly recommend it).  Your choice of toppings are extensive, and of high quality from the fresh meat to the colorful and vibrant vegetables.  Even the fresh herbs appeared to be freshly chopped.  In addition to the normal toppings, this place has a few I have not see elsewhere, like Asiago cheese, pepperoncini, fresh chopped rosemary and even a balsamic fig glaze to top it off.  The pizzas are cooked in a brick oven (not a conveyor belt like one of the other places) and come out fresh, hot and crisp in just a couple of minutes.  I made short work of the my Pesto and Veggie pizza, and will be back to expand my creativity and satisfy my hunger very soon....  They also have "design your own" salads, garlic strips, and for desserts, cinnamon strips and sweet tarts.  Although you may have to skip the dessert if you decide to indulge yourself with one of their very tasty milkshakes.  One more thing before I go.  I have to mention the to-go boxes that are actually two separate pieces, which I found a bit odd at first, until I realized it was a clever and convenient way to share (if you can).  P.S. Extra kudos for having Angry Orchard Cider!

In an area where your only options were to drive across town or settle for a supermarket or convenience store donut, this place is like an oasis in the desert. They had their grand opening yesterday and I stopped in this morning to try out the goods.  The store was very clean and welcoming, even at 5:30 am. Having grown up in the northeast, a Boston Creme is my donut of choice, and is also one of the hardest to perfect.  Upon taking my first bite, I was thrown back...It was perfection.  The donut was soft and tender, the filling was real pastry cream, and like the chocolate glaze upon it, was not overly sweet or drowning in vanilla. I also tried an apple fritter, which was one of the best I have had in a very long time.  Flavorful, tender crumb, apple pieces and just enough glaze to enhance, but not overpower the main feature. I can't wait to go back and sample some more of what this place has to offer
