The staff is friendly. The room temperature is always perfect -never too cold, the music is pleasant both in choice and volume. The coffee is very tasty. And the wait time is never long.

Service is more on the rude side... We found a hair in our water and when we asked the waitress for new water and glasses the she acted upset and inconvenience and did not apologized. The establishment over all is dirty. The food was good, not good enough to come back.

Showed up to see Lil Jon with some friends. The layout of this place is near perfect. Bottle service was very good; Average prices, but most servers poured heavy. Bathrooms were classy and clean. The temperature of the place was comfortable throughout the night. And this crowed was perfect, no nonsense or douchebaggery.
