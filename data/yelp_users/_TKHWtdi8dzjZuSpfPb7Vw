Surprisingly good food, tucked in the mall close to the Little Einstein daycare. We ordered 2 regular dishes and one large order of Sukiyaki Beef! It's the best take out sukiyaki beef I've had ever!! Yummy! The chicken teriyaki is also very good, great sauce on top - just the right amount and I'm sure we are gonna love the yakisoba - I'm told they only use fresh soba! I will definitely come back to eat in and to order take out!

This location is just ok- went there today to get some body shop camomile makeup remover but they have no BS stock at all..the cashier at front has no personality and was clearly struggling with making change during checkout. No one greeted or offered to help me in locating products, seems like hardly any staff at all at the store. I don't think I'm coming back to this location due to this experience, there are many more locations with better, vibrant knowledgeable staff.
