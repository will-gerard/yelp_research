Good standby place, with good food. It's not a fancy place and it's not the best place ever but it's always good. Never had any problems here and it's not expensive either. I've spent a lot of time here over the years and there is a reason for that.

Worst pizza hut I have ever been to. We have given it several chances and no dice. The main problem is the fact that this location never seems to honor any deals that are in ads and If they do it's more expensive.

Not really impressed with this place. Food isn't anything to write home about or to rave to out of town visitors about. I would say you are better off going to Los Gringos Locos in AJ if you are trying to eat in this area.

Glad to find this place the tamales were so good. It's hard to find a place with decent ones. One thing though is they are in limited stock so they may be out if you go too late. According to the staff you can place large holiday tamale orders a week in advance. The burrito was pretty good too and price was great!

Okay so I work downtown and have ventured to most of the places to eat in the area at least once and I noticed for some reason I had not ever been to this place. So as I walk closer I notice there is a line right up to the door of office workers which is telling me this place must be pretty good if this many office workers are waiting in line. I step in and I'm instantly hit with the smell of a real deli. The menu was filled with tasty sounding items that made me change my mind several times while waiting until I came across a little sign about a new sandwich called Nicole's Bitch-wich ( Cajun Chicken, Chipolte Ranch, Pepper Jack Cheese with all the fixings) and that won me over on sandwich choice. For as busy as the place was it was pretty fast and it was nice to see them really making a sandwich even cutting the meat freshly for each sandwich. The staff was very friendly and even broke an extra $20 I needed broken without any trouble. The woman who turned out to be the owner add's to the place with a lively NY personality with a little AZ flair carrying a firearm. I suppose it doesn't hurt that she is cute too. Any case back to the food... so I get this huge hero wrapped in classic butcher paper and it is just plain awesome. As someone else mentioned on here that this place makes a sandwich which I think beats the famous downtown deli's sandwiches and it seems to beat them price wise.  Price wise for what you get this by far blows away the chain shops like Paradise and the thought of even considering going to a subway when this place is near by is a sin. Five stars as far as sub and hero places go.

They have great food here.  It was busy and I suspect that it's busy often with many people picking up orders for take out . In any case the staff has always been polite to me or my family.

So I was expecting a lot when I walked in the door here and sadly I have to say that it failed to meet those expectations. This place seems on the outside to be a top notch pizza place that makes it's pizza in a coal brick oven like some of the best joints out there. However the truth soon becomes apparent once you order your pizza and then wait forever. The waitress was very nice and I felt bad for her because the kitchen was quite frankly letting her down big time when it came to getting things out of the oven. The pizza took around an hour to get after ordering... yes an hour for a coal fired pizza! The pizza comes and smells okay but doesn't knock your socks off aroma wise and taste wise was really bland. Even the crust which was the best part of it was very bland... it lacked flavor. The other issue was a lack of toppings and sauce. The sauce was missing something and was only lightly dabbled in spots on the pizza and for supposedly real cheese (what little was on it) it was tasteless. Being a lover of pizza I was highly saddened by this place that seemed to have soo much potential. Pricewise you expect more for what you are paying and everyone in my group was very depressed with the quality. I don't however think the place is beyond redemption and if they would make some changes to add some real flavor they could have a nice place here. However I won't be going back anytime soon unless I hear they have made some changes. I think the only reason this place has been able to make so far is because of its location at the San Tan Marketplace and not really on the merits of its food. You end up really wanting to like the place but it just doesn't happen. I would suggest if you want a good pizza for around the same price point check out  Venezia Pizza...

If you are looking for a decent slice of New York pizza in the valley this is a great place to start. Venezia's Pizza is a step above most of the pizza in the valley. Customer service is great but you will want to order ahead on Friday night if you are doing takeout because the secret is out about this small chain that has several locations. The pizza has flavor...something that is missing from a lot of places... the cheese has that good salty taste of real pizza with sauce that also makes you want more. I for one like to opt for pepperoni and green olives as the perfect combo of taste. The pizza here if you get the New York style by the slice is huge and they have a wonderfully huge party pan pizza that is so huge that they have on going contest for two people to eat one to get your photo on the wall. They also have a Sicilian pizza if you are into that sort of thing  as well which is huge. Wings are good and they do a slice deal with wings and a beer at some locations that is pretty affordable. So to sum it up... come here if you want some real pizza.

So Jimmy John's is a sub place that has a fast service theme. They are pretty quick for how busy they get. However the food isn't what I'd call good. I feel like the sandwiches are lacking character and flavor. While better than Subway it's not nearly as good as any number of non-chain sandwich places in the area such the Hero Factory or the Downtown Deli which are both great establishments. Jimmy John's is far from gourmet and I almost feel like having a sign up that mentions gourmet is just wrong on several levels. If you walk down to the area on lunch break from work or jury duty you'd be better off just going next door and getting a Five Guys burger... yes you will feel guilty about how bad for you it is but at least it's the good kind of bad and  and not the kind of bad taste bad you get at Jimmy John's.

The food is good the staff is friendly. Parking is horrible and it's not the quickest place to eat to be honest. If you are looking for good artistic fun pizza with some different choices then usual this place is good if you want a Slice of New York style this is not the place to go. I'll most likely be going back. As an update the place has been crossed off our lunch group list at work because it just takes too much time to to get your food.

Maybe I'm a hater or maybe there is something wrong with this place but the Starbucks of tortilla based food leaves me with a meh feeling.... Part of it might be the crowd but the other part maybe what I feel reminds me of a blob wrapped up in a whole lot of yuppie tortilla. Obviously many people love this place as they are popping up everywhere. This is either a sign of me being out of touch, maybe even a subconscious attempt to be a food snob or it's just a sign that people will buy into the theme that is being put up by this place on a massive scale. I just know that it's not for me.  This location is always swamped by legions of office workers and students to the point that you will be waiting in a line if you do decide to go here. The place is lively and to be honest if you are looking to meet people maybe even a few girls to talk up it might be a good place to go.

Great Time. Took my parents here and they had a blast. They do the standard show here for this type of place but it's done well. Food was good the roll I had was great. If you are looking for a good interactive dining experience this is a great place to go.

Really good food and some unique choices. The place however is a tad too expensive in relation to portion size to be honest but I'm willing to pay a little more from time to time to enjoy the food here. Parking can be an issue since there are a ton of places around this place. If you are looking for something new and in the mood for brunch give the place a try.

The Henhouse Cafe is to be blunt the best breakfast joint I have eaten at in years. There is a fantastic menu with many classic options but also a mix of things that will pique your curiosity after reading the descriptions. I've seen a few people mention wait times to which I say of course there is a wait! This place is super busy but this place is worth waiting a little extra time for. I'd take waiting for good real food anytime over a quick plate of muck from the common chains that dominate the breakfast market. I got a chicken fried steak with biscuits and gravy and it had heart to it. The gravy had flavor the biscuit was grand and the chicken was hand breaded. My grandfather got a pancake that requires a small pizza box to take home leftovers in. His coffee was full the whole time even with it being slammed and the waitress was on top of keeping everyone happy. The Henhouse Cafe is now on my list of places to go out of way to go to and will be spreading the breakfast gospel to go here for sure. So if you find yourself deciding between the The Henhouse Cafe and the First Watch (formerly the Good Egg) you'll want to pick the Henhouse.

Great food. It's got flavor and it tastes fresh. It was the perfect lunch on a cold and rainy day. I had three enchiladas with green and red sauce and some fantastic habanero sauce. Did not leave disappointed and hope to come back soon.

Above average breakfast and will most likely be going back. The waffle was wonderful and the syrup was real. Fantastic thick cut bacon. One thing though it seems strange to me that biscuits and gravy is missing from the menu of a breakfast joint. Very busy place however we were seated quickly and service was quick.
