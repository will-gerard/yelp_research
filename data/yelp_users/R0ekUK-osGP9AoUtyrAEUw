There is really one reason that I go to China Chili all the time...The boiled wontons.  The rest of the food is pretty typical chinese fare.  Best to take a group of friends and mix and match dishes.   Our favorite dishes here, besides the boiled won tons, are the spicy eggplant and the green beans and tofu.  We order them extra spicy to kick it up a notch. Even extra spicy and Dan will load up both the boiled won tons and the dishes with the hot sauce at the table.  In fact we usually leave the hot sauce jar empty by the time we leave the restaurant.    Parking is a bit hard to find on busy nights there and I usually end up parking on the street.    The portions are gigantic and I always have take away dishes for the next day.  Prices are reasonable.  If you do order the soup realize you can order it and share for the table.

Fried pickles in phoenix?  Okay, so they are not the same as the fried pickles at Julians in Providence.  but they are actually quite good.  We like 'em with the cajun seasoning and the buffalo sauce for dipping.  Ooh so good and hot!    They have beer.  They have lots of beer and will keep it coming.  Beware of the tall beers.  They have  way of sneaking up on you.    Their burgers are great.  They use high quality beef when making them.  I enjoy a burger where I feel like I don't need it covered in cheese to enjoy the flavor.  I don't especially like cheese on a burger but will order it when I think a place is going to be mediocre so that it covers up the flavor.  Their burgers are served on a brioche that is not buttered (yay!).    I also enjoy their pulled pork sandwich.    For their sides:  The steak fries are yummy here if you're feeling decadent.  their onion rings are really, really yummy if you're feeling extra decadent.  their salad is really good and comes with a vast assortment of unique dressings.    Now the downside.  If you got on a Friday or Saturday night then don't expect to be able to carry on a conversation with your friends.  The music is LOUD and inside it is virtually impossible to carry on a conversation unless you're yelling.    Most other times this is just a great place to come hang out, have some beers with friends with no attitudes.  Great, friendly service.  The manager on duty is always around.

Now that is some spicy Thai food!  When it comes to choosing Asian in Phoenix one usually has to be pretty selective.  Thai Lahna takes away some of that selective pressure.    As an appetizer we had the Chicken Satay.  It was okay but didn't blow me away.  The peanut sauce, however, was really, really good.  Which made up for the kind of tasteless Chicken Satay.    For entrees we chose the Pad Thai and the Fried Rice.  We ordered the Pad Thai medium and the rice hot.  The Pad Thai was definitely on the flavorful spicy side.  It did make me sweat and cleared out my sinuses.  The Rice was really good...Although scallions and onions in the dish made it a bit too oniony.  Next time we would probably tell them to hold the scallions back.  The rice was also like a nuclear explosion going off in your mouth.  It was wonderful!    The portion sizes were good without going overboard.  I will definitely be enjoying Thai Lahna again.    Next time I want to venture into their curry dishes.    I give this restaurant 4 Noms!

Mexican produce at this store is top notch!  A+...Woohoo.  Great pepper selection.  VERY Reasonable prices.  We get Kale from here all the time and it is superb.  Sadly...This store has now closed and is yet another huge empty retail and eye sore in Phoenix.  The owner of the plaza apparently wants exorbitant rents based on the number of shops in that same plaza that have closed.

Okay...Getting a vet that will actually talk to you and discuss your pets health and history is remarkable in this day and age.  I was very impressed with Dr. Clark and his genuine care for the health of your pet.    One thing that I really appreciate is that the office seems to take into account that you are the customer and you direct them to the level of care your pet needs.  I agree they didn't  seem overly anxious to sell me services that I really don't need, but, also emphasized the importance of things like heartworm medication.    I recommend Dr. John Clark and the staff at the Orangewood Animal Hospital.

Stopped by here with the partner in between classes at Phoenix College.  We were pleasantly surprised.  Had the Burro and the Tamale...both were excellent.  We also found a great spot if you just want to go have a couple of alco-beverages and some chips and salsa.  Salsa tasted fresh which is a +++ in our book.  Love that they have Double Bubble in the bathroom and at the register.  That stuff rules -- even if it tastes like wax seconds after you put it in your mouth.

Okay -- It's a bit quirky yes.  The food isn't all that great.  My ribs were cold when they arrived.  I got sick that night.  Enough said.

I'm from Salt Lake City, and I really haven't had good Greek food since I left there.   Well last night I found it at Greektown.  The service was great, the food was fantastic.  We enjoyed the Melitsano Salata as an appetizer.    Served with delicious warmed pita bread it is a great way to start out your dinner at Greektown.    George, the owner, is very enthusiastic about his place and what he has to offer.   Take the time to get to know him.  He has lots of stories.  Make sure to ask him about the photo he has of Jimmi Hendrix.    The gyros are great here.  We like the Grexican.  All of the Greek dishes are great.  As George likes to say "everything is fantastic, you should get it."    We go to Greektown often and always enjoy it.  It also seems to be gaining a great reputation as the business there has definitely picked up.  We're very happy it has.  This is a great local business to support!  Greektown is fantastic.  You should go.

How much do I love breakfast at the 5th Ave Cafe?  A ton.  This is my new favorite breakfast place in Phoenix.  I used to try to go to Matt's Big Breakfast but honestly it isn't worth a two or greater hour wait for bacon and eggs.    First of all, 5th Avenue Cafe has plenty of seating.  Their meals are good.  Their portions on the gigantor side which can be a good or bad thing.  Just realize that when you are ordering.    their Huevos are probably the best around.    A superlative choice if you want a breakfast that is scrummers!

Went there for a special night out with my partner.  We were greeted promptly and seated outside.  The patio is nice with a charm that only Phoenix can offer.  We looked over the menu and were pleased with the choices.  Our appetizer choice were the empanadas which were quite flavorful.  I was crazy about the empanada dough they used, but it was passable.  The wonderful spiced empanada filling and crazy hot sauce fusion made up for the sub-par empanada dough.  We also had the chorizo and bean soup.  The blend of flavors in the soup was really fantastic.  We were both pleased with the soup.  It was also moderately priced at $3.00 per cup.   For entrees I had the Crusted Talapia.  It had a strange, yet flavorful sauce that it was served in.  For sides I had the arroz con gradules and the chipotle mashed potatoes.  Both my sides were great.    My partner had the Pork.  It was good, if a little fatty, but it had a wonderful marinated flavor to it.  For sides he also had the mashed potatoes (he raved about them too) and the jalapeno creamed corn.  The creamed corn was really good.    My entree was $19.  His entree was $18.  For dessert we had the banana burrito.  WOW!  This was so decadent, but we both ate it voraciously.    Drinks were good.  The martini my partner had was an interesting fusion of flavors.  I had their sangria which I found enjoyable enough, even if not on the fruity side.    All in all we would definitely go back to the Fuego Bistro.

They had Gay Beast in stock...has to be awesome based on that alone.   A good selection of vinyl for those who never gave it up.

This is okay bbq fare but there is nothing special about it.  Their sauces are bland.  The food has no great flavors and tastes overly microwaved or possibly like it came in a bag from Sysco.  They give you too much food and the prices reflect the portion sizes.    I've had the ribs and pulled pork sandwiches.  Both were meh...nothing special to write home about.    I wouldn't make this a destination but if you have other things to do while shopping at Norterra...it isn't a bad choice, just a VERY mediocre one.

So many great things about America's Taco Shop.  It has become one of our favorite places in the valley.  Good food, cheap beer, great patio.   The carne asada is really great.  All their ingredients taste fresh.  It is one of the best places in Phoenix for cheap, easy eats.  Go grab a carne asada now!

Unlike other people we were greeted promptly and given excellent service.  The counter staff asked us several times if everything was okay and met with out satisfaction.  The burgers here are top notch and run about 7 bucks.  But they are HUGE!  Not in the mood for so much red meat...relax...they also offer turkey, chicken, and veggie burgers.  I am a fan of their turkey burger.    I've only had the fried zucchini as far as appetizers.  The fried zucchini was average and okay.  The burgers are the definite stand outs at  this joint.  I think clearly they realized their service was not up to par and they have made corrections.  Their burgers are definitely worth the trip.

Smashburger for that down home Ikea feel.  I wasn't impressed.  Their menu is pretty standard burger fare...bbq burger, mushroom swiss burger.  I didn't see anything out of the ordinary in their offerings.    I was excited for their sweet potato fries when I ordered them.  Wasn't so excited to eat them.  They were doused in olive oil and rosemary.  I'm a rosemary purist and don't think you are required to cook with a lot of it to get the flavor out of it.  Too much rosemary is a bad thing -- it overpowers everything and you lose the other flavors in translation.    Their burgers were ok.  But lets face it, how hard is it to mess up a burger.    I wish places would quit buttering buns.  I can't ever remember to tell them not to butter it and I think the butter actually mutes the taste of the sandwich.    Smashburger wasn't my favorite.  Don't think I'll be dining there again.    I rank it slightly ahead of Culvers.  Mad the mistake of going back here.  Hated even worse the second time.  Guess I'm just not a fan.
