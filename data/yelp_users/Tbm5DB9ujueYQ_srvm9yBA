I was referred here by a friend when my cat broke his leg. It was a little out of my way.... HOWEVER; I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY by Dr. Darger! He genuinely cares about his precious furry patients. He did not rush, stayed in the room and answered every question even though we came in for a unscheduled appointment. He found a life threatening condition my Charlie has.... Sent me to a Vet Cardiologist. Stayed late after we received cardiac clearance to move forward with the surgery. That same night he was leaving for a conference out of town but still waited for us. Called me after the surgery just after 9pm to let me know how the surgery went and how my baby was doing. Didn't charge me extra money for pain meds! Saved me a ton of money vs going to a orthopedic vet.... A significant amount of money$$$. He was calling to check on him the 1st post op day when I was picking Charlie up. Then to top it all off when I went back a few weeks later for his shots and he was so gentle and kind to my cat. Actually, rotating the injection sites and baby talking to put my little guy at ease. A little over a month later Charlie is doing fabulous! This is the place to go! Dr. Darger should be in Phoenix magazine "Top Vets" like they put "Top Docs" Thank you so very much for your WAY ABOVE AVERAGE CARE!!!! We are now committed to Power Road Animal Hospital!

Absolutely hands down the best dentist office in the East Valley! Friendly knowledgable office staff always willing to help. Dr. Polman is professional and kind and is always willing to help. I am a difficult patient and this team helps me get through it  every step of the way. I have referred a few people here and they were well cared for as well. It does cost me more money to come here as he is not in my network but Dr. Polman's expertise is definitely worth it! He is a good honest man and I appreciate that!

Two weekends ago I ordered a pizza from her as I have many times before. I ordered a Chicken Alfredo Specialty Pizza. They delivered a pizza without chicken. I called... They said no problem. "We can make another and send it out today or replace the pizza the next time you order" Well... Today I called to order and was told that I only had a $5.00 credit. I then asked to speak to a manager and the manager on duty would not even get on the phone with me and the girl on the phone stated she (the manager on duty) said that the $5.00 credit was issued by the general manager and she could not over ride it. I then asked to speak to the General manager and he was not available. I am extremely dissatisfied with the customer service and ended up ordering  from a different place. They did not seem to care one bit that they were losing a customer.

Right on the cup it states " Made fresh daily" Our Gelato was not fresh at all!!! It had a old or freezer burnt taste. Very disappointing!!! Go to Frost in Gilbert for real Fresh Gelato!

I love these products! Very friendly staff! Shauna always calls me and let's me know when their best sales are going on. I tried Philosophy 3 years ago after buying a groupon. My top two favorite products are Purity face wash and The Micro-delivery scrub! They have a brand new firming moisturizer I just bought..... So far I am loving it! Also, you can't go wrong withy the oxygen peel!

I was blown away by the rude behavior! Very poor customer service. We went through the drive thru for the first time based on the reviews the other night. The girl working at the window was extremely rude! She slammed the window shut before I could even get her name.

Very disappointing! Our waitress recommended a appetizer & we took one bite (Yes really 1 bite) it tasted funny and I asked to send it back. It was beef heart and did not taste good! They refused to take it off the bill because we ate some of it, Really? What kind of service is that? The main dishes that we orderd were just ok and it was 10-15.00$ a plate. We had to ask many times for a refill on our drinks. Very poor customer service! Our worst restaurant experience since moving here 4 years ago! NEVER AGAIN! Bummer for our few and far between Saturday date nights!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.................................

I feel extremely blessed to have found AJ McKay auto repair. I actually found him them on Craigslist searching for a car. My first phone call to AJ I was impressed. He spent 20 min on the phone with me allowing me to explain my situation and was very patient and informative. He was very honest and upfront right from the beginning. He helped me get my daughter into a safe dependable car and will now be our mechanic from this point forward. I have also been referring him to a few people and one person already knew who he was and confirmed his great reputation. Excellent customer service!!! I am impressed!!!

Very good egg rolls as stated! However, I ordered the V6. Vermicelli with Grilled Shrimp/egg roll. (It only has 3 slightly over cooked small grilled shrimp. It was still good food, but next time I will try a chicken dish.  I had also had very good service!

Very disappointed! First of all it was ridiculous expensive... 2 large pizza's and wings $55.00. More  expensive than 2 XL Rosati's pizza's. I don't mind cost of Rosati's because it is excellent and made with fresh mushrooms verses the canned mushrooms we had on our pizza tonight. The pizza was loaded with lettuce and soggy.  The crust was tasteless and as previously stated. The wings were so soggy & drenched with sauce. I am from the Midwest and we never had pizza this bad. I can honestly say I would rather have Little Caesars or even frozen pizza. I should have trusted the previous reviewer that stated consider yourself warned.
