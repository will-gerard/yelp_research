Love this place. Great rates for what I need and nothing I don't. If they had a pool, I would be a lifelong member

Best pizza I've had in years. The crust is perfect, not too crunchy or too chewy or too greasy, and the sauce is equally well balanced. Also, do yourself a favor and try the Greek Salad.

First off, you walk into this place and it smells like a European cafe should: competing hints of baking bread, roasting coffee, and various cured meats and cheeses. The wife and I each tried pasta dishes, she the Penne Carbonara and I the Roasted Almond Tortellini. The tortellini were perfectly cooked, and the flavors of the stuffing and the sauce were mild enough while still being hearty and satisfying. We tried the Night Before cake for dessert, which was like an incredibly dense cocoa mousse on a macaroon crust. Definitely as good as it sounds! We will certainly be back, but probably just for coffee and dessert because this place is a bit pricey!

If Chipotle weren't so concerned with projecting the illusion of health conscious fare, their food would be as delicious as Cafe Rio.

Outstanding value and always delicious. The free lassi, chai, naan, and sizzling tandoori chicken served with dinner make this place a more comprehensive meal than most Indian Buffets, though they come with no added cost. My wife and I have been here many times, and while the food is consistently flavorful at a good price, it's not so special as to earn a 5-star rating.

Bad food and slow service. It was a Friday night and the wife and I felt like some pub food. It should have been really busy at dinner time, but the wait staff to customer ratio was very high. Waited 10 minutes before anyone came by to take drink orders, so we asked to order right away, I tried the reuben sliders and my wife the shephard's pie. The meat in the Reuben was decent, but the swiss had been heated to the point of being rubbery. My meal was also served with coleslaw, which seemed to be nothing more than cabbage and mayo. My wife's shephard's pie was a molten mass of instant potatoes, overcooked hamburger and store bought gravy. It looked like a horrid brown gruel once the ingredients were mixed. The only redeeming qualities I noticed were a decent Irish bar aesthetic and an apprpriate drink selection for this motif. The only ways I could force myself to return would be to meet friends there for drinks on St. Patrick's day.

It's rare these days to encounter affordable baked goods that are crafted with such skill. Whether it's an old fashioned, a fritter, a maplebar, or their blueberry cake donut, you will likely rank these among the best donuts you've ever had. They're neither too sweet, nor too fluffy, nor too buttery. They achieve near perfection.  They carry a few other nice items, such as the jalape√±o ham croissant sandwich, which is great to split over coffee. Also available are some enormously tasty boba style teas and smoothies. God knows how many calories are in their shakes, but you probably won't care once you taste them. Seriously, give this place a try!
