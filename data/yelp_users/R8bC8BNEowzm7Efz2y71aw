I am definitely a fan of their subs, they have always been fresh and tasty. I do have one complaint on the "Chicken Caesar salad" which I had ordered awhile back. To be honest it was a pathetic excuse for a Caesar salad. First of all my chicken was heated in the microwave which was a little unappealing and the texture was a little off. Second, there was no croutons, no parmesan, and the lettuce was a shredded iceberg/romaine mix. To top it all the dressing wasn't a creamy caesar dressing so I was 100% disappointed with this salad. I would have named it the Plain Microwaved Chicken Salad.

Went in around 12am and the place wasn't too busy as you might expect at midnight. Waited for 15-20 minutes for the food to show up and when it arrived we were missing my boyfriend's food. The server apologized explaining that the kitchen forgot the order (but I think she had forgot to ring it in and wasn't being upfront) and said "please don't hate me". His food came out after about 5min and the waitress did offer us a complimentary dessert but I was still disappointed with service because she was simply not very attentive. We watched her do sidework as we were waiting on her to come by to our table. Being a server myself I understand that there are circumstances that are out of your control and sometimes you can't give as good of service as you normally would  however I feel that we could have had much better experience had our server been more attentive because it simply wasn't very busy.

This is definitely my favorite place to come for a gyro. The owner is a total sweetheart and already knows my order when I come in. Delicious!

My boyfriend and I come here pretty often. We absolutely love the fundido sauce, it is sinfully delicious! Love the cantina especially when it's not so busy. The service is usually good and the huge yummy portions are enough to keep us coming back. Love the buy 1 get 1 coupons we get in the mail!

After my last nail salon spot closed down I was looking for a new place & I think this shop will be my new go to spot when I need a mani/pedi. Reasonable price. The man who did my nails was very friendly and did a great job.

Went in with my friend to get mani/pedis and was picking out colors. I like to change my nail color a lot and was trying to find a new color that I liked, after a minute of looking the lady walked over and asked if I found a color yet. I felt a little rushed and just decided on the color in my hand. During our pedicures the man who was doing my friend's toes accidentally cut her and appeared to try to cover it up before she saw but too late because she sure felt it! He poured what I assume was an antibacterial liquid on her toe which was bleeding pretty good and it obviously stung very badly. I'm not even sure that he said sorry.. he directed her to put her feet in the tub which she questioned if she should since she had an open wound. They said that it would be ok because they wash them out. A different lady ended up finishing my friend's nails (which I'm sure put her a little at ease). When we were finished and went to pay they hadn't even given my friend a discount for slicing her toe open! Her toe was all bloody on the side and it looked like they just put the polish over it. This is one week later that i'm writing this review and my nails turned out pretty at first (and unscathed) but the gel on my fingers is already falling off and I was told they would last for three weeks. My friend on the other hand has a red and purple infected toe! I will definately not be coming back and not sure you should either..

I ordered a #5 "The Vito". I was impressed by the quick service however the sandwich was mediocre. The bread was kind of dry and was ripped so it fell apart a little as I was eating it. Not bad, but nothing I need to go back for anytime soon.
