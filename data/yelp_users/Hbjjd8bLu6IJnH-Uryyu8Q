The new seating is great. I like how you can choose your seats and not have to worry about where you are sitting. The new seats are very nice quality and very comfortable. When we walked into the theater, there was a trash can in there, but nobody had cleaned the theater yet. Somebody went and told a manager and they came in and cleaned it 5 minutes prior to the movie starting. I didn't really enjoy the popcorn as it was kind of flavorless. I did get a small coke Icee and it was really good. I like this theater because its usually not as crowded, but I think that's going to change now that they have the new nice seats. Good thing you can order online and choose your seats early and not worry about the show being sold out or having crappy seats!

I was very disappointed with this place. The egg drop soup smelled like a wet dog and looked pretty gross too. I couldn't even bring myself to try it. The egg rolls were ok, they could have been more crunchy. The fried rice was decent. I got the panang chicken curry and the flavor was pretty good. I won't be back here. There are way better places around for Thai or Asian food.

I come here because the food and smoothies are good and it's close to work. But every time I leave I always say I'm not coming back. I have once to be greeted or have somebody say we will be right with you, even after standing in line for 5 + minutes without being helped. The chubby balding guy is always there, with his usual I'm to cool to be here attitude and no smile 'what can I get you' greeting. My sandwich always has tomatoes even though I ask for no tomatoes every time. My guess is they don't read the reviews since this is the norm review for over a year. If they got it together I might come here more than once a month.

Best Mexican food in the valley hands down. Food is always fresh and authentic. Friendly staff and it's clean even though it's not in the best part of town. Their drinks and deserts are good too. I have to come here every time I'm in this part of town.

I really enjoy this place. People are very friendly and nice. Everything is made fresh to order. The havenburger is really good. My wife gets the breakfast burrito with sausage egg, potato and cheese. It is one of the best breakfast burritos I have ever had. I like to support local restaurants and this is one I would like to stay around so please support them and give them a try. Maybe come by after or before a temple session!

Lines can get pretty long but it's worth it. Staff is always friendly. There are always a few new flavors to try.

Amazing Thai! They have a salad and soup buffet that comes with the lunch special. The peanut dressing for the salad is really really good. I got the pad sew ew and it's the best I have had in the valley. Fast and friendly service. I just started working in the area and this will be my go to for Thai at least once a week.

This place is pretty hard to find. As another reviewer pointed out, the orange umbrellas help locate it. Alan was inside prepping some popsicles to be made. He explained some of their processes and machines and let me taste almost all the flavors they offer. Its cool to kind of see "backstage" of how everything works and all the different machines they use. All of the flavors were amazing, even the banana, and I am not even that big of a banana fan. The banana walnut really surprised me as it tasted exactly like Banana nut bread, YUM! Way cheaper than other gelato places. I live close to Frost in Gilbert and for the price of the small size at Frost, i got a large at Doc's and the flavors taste better! You wont regret visiting this little gelato gem!

Buffet is really good. Tikka masala, chicken curry, curry pakora were all very good. Naan was hot and fresh and tasted sooo good, your choice of garlic or plain. They don't skimp on the naan either. You got 4 large pieces at a time. Others only give you a piece or two at a time. I was able to try both and actually liked the plain better. Servers were very friendly and took my plate as soon as I was finished and kept my glass full. I guess a family owns it, mother, father and two sons. The dad is legit with a turban and a huge smile ready to get you what you need. For desert I had some of the best rice pudding I have ever had at an Indian buffet, and you can never go wrong with the gulab jaman. All you can eat for less than 10 bucks! I'll be back soon!
