Food is always amazing. Shrimp cocktail and crab cakes are a must for apps.  Spicy caesar or French Onion for salad/soup option.  Kansas city bone-in a MUST for steak... Mouth watering.  Butter cake for dessert...You think you will just go in for a bite, but that isn't going to happen.  It's perfection.

Absolutely love this place.  Their pizza is delicious and has the best crust, especially the individual pizza's (rusticas).  They also have amazing sliders.  I have yet to go wrong with any thing I have ordered from Crust.  The ambiance is great, as well as the service.

Great spot for Thai take-out.  Love the Pad Thai and Green Curry.  Great prices for great food and good hearty portions.  Always have enough for multiple meals.

I have been to 20 Lounge a handful of times and each time I have been very pleased with my experience.  The nail techs are all very friendly and easy to talk to.  I have never had a complaint about my manicure or pedicure.  The paint has always been right up to my cuticles and smooth (I am very particular about this). Overall great experience.

The last three times I have ordered delivery from this location it has taken an hour or longer.  When you call to check on your order they always say, "Oh, the driver is on their way.  It should only be another 5 minutes." Yeah right.  This is the slowest location EVER.  I only live 1.5 miles away, how can it possibly take an hour????   So unless you have an hour to kill before you decide you are hungry and want to eat, I would recommend another option.
