We have purchased well over 6 macs and 8 iPads from this store. My iMac pro was dropped off to be repaired. There was a family emergency and were unable to get back to the store. The store sent the computer to be destroyed-- and there is no resolution available-- I m without an 1800 computer and could not be more disappointed.

I love my palm beach location. Ellie has a great deal of education and experience that has made all the difference for me.

Great service and beautiful work. The staff is accommodating and extremely friendly & honest. I felt taken care of and was comfortable letting my tech make the decision that was best for my nails given my daily activities.
