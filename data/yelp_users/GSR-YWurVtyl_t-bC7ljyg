Enjoyed a Sunday afternoon Happy Hour here this weekend before catching a flight back to the Bay Area. I was with two friends who live nearby and enjoyed their company as much as I enjoyed the pretty view from the outdoor patio of Canyon Caf√©.   I was in Arizona for the Ragnar Relay so most of the places I saw were on foot or looking out the window of a minvan. This was really the only afternoon of my vacation that I had to rest and relax and see the town.   Service was terrific. Saul (I think that's what he said) was very attentive and brought us some delicious chips to start and even a wonderful white chocolate tomale dessert at the end. We had $4 margaritas and one iced tea as we sat by the unlit firepit. Everything was perfect! I would definitely return here next time I visit friends or run another out-of-state race.

Perfect for tourists like me that decide to brave the 15 freeway and drive 10 hours to Vegas, rather than hop on a plane and eat salty nuts. As soon as we arrived in Vegas we stopped at this little gem for snacks and some cold road sodas.  Ended up with some 3 packs of Bud Light ($4.99), Jalapeno Chex Mix ($1.89) and a couple other 20 oz. sodas ($1.59).  We were in and out of there really quickly due to convenient parking up front and fast service.  Also nice is that they will give you change on your debit card. Not all places do this.  7-11s do but only up to $10.00.  We took $40 back in change from our purchase! Love being able to do that.

THAT WAS EASY  I love flying into McCarren. I feel like the staff here are friendlier than some airports; plus it's big and clean and easy to get around.  AND we can gamble while waiting for the flight! We actually didn't want to gamble this time. We wanted to charge our phones. There was a charging station but it was standing area and we had comfy seats at our gate. There was an outlet on the floor to plug our chargers into but it wasn't working.   We  didn't have time to check out any of the food or bars but saw quite a few options. Lucky for us, Virgin allowed us to move to an earlier flight and we didn't spend much time in the airport!

FREMONT STREET WAS THE FIRST PAVED ROAD IN LAS VEGAS  This famous street is second only to the Las Vegas Strip. The Fremont Street Experience was constructed almost 20 years ago and the Fremont Hotel & Casino is in the heart of the area.  Like most of the older hotels in this area, the casino is full of older machines. Some slots even return nickels and quarters, rather than tickets. Beware if you cash out with lots of winnings! It can take a while!! We have fun on these older machines. Most new ones don't take change so it's nice to walk by and put in the last quarter in your pocket or the dime you just found.  Great food deals can be found in Fremont Casino. Tony Roma's restaurant is in here, as well as some fast food places. Drinks can be found at casino bars or from cocktail service while you gamble.  I've stayed at a few of the downtown hotels, though never at Fremont. I generally don't stay downtown. It doesn't seem as safe to me and the parking garages don't have valets running by the cars all night. I instead stay close to the strip and drive to Fremont for the fun.  The casinos in glitter gulch are all worth a stop-in. You definitely won't miss this one as you walk by! Stop. Admire the lights. And then go bet some nickels inside.

SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL  Before we packed our Vegas bags, I commented to my husband that while there, I wanted to find a cheap lobster dinner. Some wives probably ask to be taken out to a nice lobster dinner. I wanted a nice dinner too, don't get me wrong, but I knew a cheap lobster dinner could be found and I wanted us to find it.  We were there less than 48 hours when dinner found us! We had been walking around Downtown Vegas and seen signs on the Fremont Hotel for an $11.99 steak and lobster dinner. I pointed it out with excitement. Unfortunately, we weren't hungry! But....after a couple more hours strolling and dancing, our appetites caught up and it happened to be between the hours the special was being served!  We had a 30 minute wait and we were not alone. The waiting area was packed! We were finally sat and our server (George) dropped off menus on his way to take another order. He returned not long after with a smile, even though I'd watched him scurry from table to table in the interim. His section was slammed and one booth was pretty impatient about not having received their bill yet. We decided we weren't in a hurry and placed identical orders (lobster and extra rare steak). I added a side dish of garlic green beans to mine.  Bread service came. A plate of Promise (buttery spread) packets came with it. A serious mound of fake butter! We ate our share until the dinners arrived.  I don't anything nice to say about the flat piece of steak I received, except that it was very rare and it wasn't bad dipped in butter, but mine was mostly fat. Husband ate all of his and said it was about what he expected. We both agreed the lobster was better than expected. They were tiny tails but they were tender and well-seasoned and the drawn butter coated the bites nicely. My green beans were actually terrible. Rubbery and not much garlic to be found. For the meal we received, the excellent service, and the cost, overall I would say we found a great value here!  ($28.40 total)  A good server can really set the tone for the evening. George's contagious smile kept us smiling all night too.

My husband and I were in Vegas in 2013 for a Helicopter convention (he's a heli pilot). We had an amazing experience at the Flamingo and they were my 500th review. I had hoped review #1,000 would be for our most recent stay at the Excalibur in Jan 2014. Bleh! What a nightmare. I have a pretty awesome memory, and there were so many horrible things about this experience that I actually had to start writing them down so that I wouldn't forget!  We booked this trip just for fun and because Southwest Airlines had a good deal. It was less than $200 each for four days, our flights, and a rental car, plus $20 hotel food/drink credit. Which honestly is about what you can find anytime for mid-week, off-season in Vegas. The trip was supposed to include all taxes/fees but a mandatory resort fee for use of the fitness center and such was imposed upon arrival. Whatever, it was only $50 more.  The robot of a woman who checked us in told us there was wifi in the rooms. I asked if it was free wifi and she said yes. While the casino floor has wifi, there is none in the rooms. So her misinformation was a little annoying. But worse than that was that around every corner of the hotel, someone is waiting to ask if you want free show tickets, free dinner, free this, free that. All you have to do is listen to them offer you a deal where you pay up front to come back to Vegas in the next year... blah blah scam.  We also had papers shoved under the door in our room with the same "please come hear our non-time-share presentation" bull sh*t written all over them. (As well as different pizza delivery places shoving their ads under our room door.) So much for respecting our vacation privacy. The last thing you want to hear while you're getting it on in your Vegas hotel room is some stranger at your door giving you unwanted advertisements. F*ck you, Excalibur.  The $20 food/drink credit isn't valid at the Hotel Buffet which makes absolutely no sense, so we used it at the Steakhouse which was a joke as well. Gross service; average food. Everything about this hotel is below what anyone would consider an acceptable standard. I imagine they once had their glory days... but even the carpet in Tower 2's elevators (EVERY elevator) was worn down with holes, exposing the glue. Which was sort of funny since a flooring convention was taking place while we were there. The five minutes of work it would take to lay new carpet is probably something they could've secured a good deal on last week.  We enjoyed the pool, but the fitness center that our resort fees were paying for was rather small. I still enjoyed it every morning. The adjacent locker rooms are an additional fee with locker rental for $25! Other spa prices were absurd as well. Every morning around 7:30 a.m. we received a new phone message telling us to check out their spa services. Every morning! An overpriced massage from this hotel? No thanks!  Of all the hotels we gambled at (at least 10 or more), Excalibur had the worst drink service. It was non-existent. You'd think you'd get a drink if you sit at a machine long enough? Yes, we did. We got one drink the first night we were there. (It happened to be the best hot chocolate we'd ever tasted in our lives) but in the days that followed we never had the opportunity to get another drink. Walk over to Luxor and gamble there, or head elsewhere on the strip. This place sucks.  The queen beds in our room on the 20th floor were horrible (room 20228). We slept in one the first night, (or rather, barely slept), and went to switch to the other the second night, in hopes it was better, but there were old blood stains on the sheets so we went back to the first bed. We switched to a king room on the 23rd floor (room 23269) the last night ($5 fee but they waived it for us). The bed was a lot better. Not like a Marriott mattress, but we finally got some good rest. Or perhaps we were just exhausted by then. The pillows were the best thing about the rooms. Soft, plush, large and wonderful.   The "contemporary" rooms had bathrooms from the 80s with little showers spraying water with poor pressure. No bath tubs. At least they appeared clean and the towels were soft. Aside from check-in, the staff we interacted with were nice. Room service people we said hi to in the hallways were friendly and smiling. An awesome bartender brightened up one of our miserable days here as well.  My husband and I had an awesome trip. We had so much fun - outside of the Excalibur at other hotels. We would never stay here again though, no matter what sort of outrageous deal we were offered.

Grabbed some tall cans and brown bags for a great price. They were cold and they were going to be snuck into the Jersey Boys show.  My husband and I still had some time to kill before the show and ended up killing one of the beers.  Perhaps we didn't even need to sneak the second one in, because nobody ever said anything to us and we saw other people pulling cans out of their purses and jackets. But it was a little more fun doing it our way.  Crazy Ely store had snacks and drinks. The line moved quickly and service at the register was somewhat cordial. Convenient stop!

MASSIVE!!!  I've been to the convention center a few times. I've even attended an event as a vendor, helping my Aunt sell Cookie Lee jewelry. The most recent trip was for the Heli-Expo 2013. Husband is a helicopter pilot so we were pretty excited this year's Expo was in Las Vegas! A little work; a little play.  The Center was perfect for an Expo involving these machines. Lots of helicopters were on display and set up for sale inside. No indoor flying was allowed though.   There are lots of food options (though, they could use a couple more for good measure). The restrooms are large and were clean. It took us a couple of days to walk around and see everything. Yes, a couple of DAYS.   Parking is $10 and they wrote the date on the parking card our first day there. Luckily we were there the 5th and 6th, so we made the 5 look like a 6 with a small stroke of pen, and parked for free the next day as if we were re-entering. And that is how you save $10 on parking.

I LIKE TALKING MY HUSBAND OUT OF BUYING THINGS HE DOESN'T NEED  Sweetheart, you don't need a two-sided quarter.   After thoroughly assisting a few other customers, the lone employee was able to come to our section and help us find the quarter my husband wanted to buy. Even though we decided against the purchase (good! he would have lost it anyhow - or spent it!) we did browse the entire store. There was a lot to see, even though it's a small store. It's full from ceiling to floor with little items and games and magic tricks and masks. The clerk was helpful, showing anyone interested in something, precisely how it worked.  I saw one woman very happy with her purchase for her children. He taught her the trick so that she could teach them at home. Cute store with good customer service.

FLASH FRIED PADRON PEPPERS  We made two stops into Firefly on the most recent Vegas trip. Or was it 3? I had been thinking about Padron peppers for over a year. I've tried to find them around the Bay Area, and I tried the flash fried shisito peppers a couple months ago at Covern's Tavern in Walnut Creek, but it just wasn't the same.  I've only sat on the back patio at Firefly. Since Vegas has good weather most months of the year, and it's shaded for the hotter ones, I prefer this over the dark indoors. Service is usually pretty standard. They get very busy so it can be slow, but it never seems like I've had to wait too long.  Maybe because they serve small plates the food comes out and gets devoured faster.   On the table after you're seated is place bread with almond butter and a couple of olives. We like to add a plate of fries, a plate of salad, a hot plate of some sort, and of course... my peppers ($5.50).   The mojitos are great here but a pitcher will run $30 unless you're here during happy hour when it's half off.

DEL INFERNO, MI CORAZON  This DT caught my eye one night while we were driving back to our room. Had I been driving, we surely would have been rear-ended because I have a tendency to slam on my brakes when I see their happy signs.  Note: I only order crunchy tacos. Whether I'm at Del Taco or Taco Bell, I do not stray from my simple order: between 3 and 8 crunchy tacos. I usually prefer them with light meat and extra lettuce. They have to have 3 packets of hot sauce (I like to use one mild, one medium, and one hot) and a half-packet of salt.   So here we are in Vegas and I see DT, so of course (!) I made my husband park even though we'd been on our feet all day and were exhausted. We found a parking spot several blocks away and walked through a detour for construction and around some dark corners until we were finally back on the strip and headed up to the food court.   A polite employee gave me my tacos ($1.59 each) and the night was complete.   Del Taco - please come to Walnut Creek, CA :)  xoxo

REVIEW #1,000 - Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant deserves this spot!  After an early morning phone message from our hotel trying to sell us spa services, we were out of bed and ready to get out of that casino once we were done at their gym. We stopped at Chase to get some cash, and only then realized it was getting late and we hadn't eaten yet. Blueberry was visible from the bank's location so we excitedly headed there. As we walked in, the hungry husband and myself were happy to see it wasn't packed, but wasn't empty either.  I ordered two eggs, hashbrowns and sourdough, with a side of the hot house salsa and a roasted jalapeno. (I had seen one in the menu pictures and had to have it.) It didn't take long for the hot food to arrive and our waitress told me they'd roasted 2 jalapenos for me! Yumm. These were no ordinary jalapenos. I don't know how they found huge, gigantic jalapenos, but they were awesome. Really hot, too!    Everything on the plate was yummy. My hashbrowns were cooked crispy and the sourdough was decent (it's hard to judge sourdough outside of the Bay Area because we really have the best stuff there!) The salsa was so good too! I could only eat one of the oversized jalapenos but our nice waitress brought me some Saran Wrap so that I could take the other one with me.   Service was great. Our server was attentive and friendly. I wish I knew her name, but the receipt only says "Server #8" 1/29/14 12:59 p.m.  People like her are the reason we enjoy going out to eat so often.  ($20.71 total for our breakfast.)

WINNER, WINNER, KAHUNAVILLE FOR DINNER  We walked over to Treasure Island for a dinner and drink deal we had at the bar and restaurant inside. Having some time to kill we sat at some penny machines and placed our typical 15 cent bets. It wasn't long after sitting down that I won a free game, which won ten free games, which one another ten. And on and on and on.... I ended up winning $80 off that bet. Not a bad way to start the afternoon in Treasure Island!  A girl was walking around selling Hawaiian necklaces for cancer research funding and we talked to her for a minute. She told us when the next Sirens show was (which we ended up missing). If you're on this part of the strip in the late afternoon or evening you should stop and watch the show. They've PG'ed it up quite a bit so it's not nearly as entertaining as it used to be, but it's still pretty great.   There are lots of bars in this casino (what casino isn't filled with bars?!) A new Sr. Frogs opened last summer! Gilley's Saloon with the huge dancefloor. And Kahunaville. For me, Kahunaville is one of the better bars if you want a sweet, frozen drink. They are decorated with coconut shavings and have an extra shot of flavored liqueur on the side (we had a pineapple rum in ours). Plus, its a fun bar to sit in.   Overall, the casino is clean and well-stocked with friendly empoyees. I make sure to stop by on every Vegas trip.

DRUMROLL, PLEASE.... AND FOR MY 500TH REVIEW, ....I PICK  FLAMINGO!!   I don't need a lot out of a hotel. I don't go places to sit in a room and I think we only turned our TV on once this trip. So fancy TVs don't impress me and I don't need much more than a comfy, clean bed. Our room had no fridge, no coffee maker, no plasma TV, but it certainly was clean! Perfect!  I was super excited when we checked in on a Saturday afternoon.  We had valeted our car for free and the neither the valet nor check-in lines were very long. Crossing through the casino to get to the room elevators, we could see the garden area outside. Couldn't wait to check this place out!  I've been to LV a million times but never stayed here. Now, I don't know that I'd ever stay anywhere else.  The walk to our room from the elevator was pretty far. Surprisingly far, but walking is good for us and so I wasn't complaining.  Our room was on the 10th floor and had one lamp with a lightbulb out, a faulty shower with a slippery floor and a broken ice machine on that level. It had pink and black decorations and a very clean wood-like floor. I hate gross carpets so this caught my eye first. One night of sleep and we agreed the bed was comfy but the pillows were not. Bummer - I love lots of fluffy pillows.  The second day we stopped at customer service and asked for a room closer to the elevator. Lots of people had checked out (since it was Sunday). The lady at the counter hooked us up with a similar room but on the 21st floor, very close to the elevator and with a working ice machine outside. Everything about the room was great and it was very clean.  Good experiences with valet all week. Great experiences with the staff.  Even the cashiers were extra friendly; drink service was fast; and bartenders had heavy pours. Bugsy's Bar is one of our favorites.   We sat at the pool in the mornings. The GO pool (21 and up) wasn't open yet but will be in a couple of weeks, so it was important to get there early to get a lounge chair in the sun. This was not a problem. I had been getting up early every day. There was a bar at the pool, and you could not bring your own drinks in here. They ID'ed and checked for alcohol. I did notice a couple flasks around though.  One of the best features of Flamingo is the location. It's on the strip and centrally located. It's not one of the newest hotels but has undergone nice rennovations. We walked lots of places, even though we had a rental car. The watershow at the Fountains of Bellagio are just across the street. Quad is recently rennovated and closeby and Bills is presently undergoing construction. Paris is near, but we really liked the open-ness of the casino rooms at Flamingo best. We went next door to Margaritaville a couple times, since they're connected by a fun bar and some machines we bet pennies on.  The outside area had waterfalls and fountains, big sitting rocks and wildlife that included turtles, fish, and real flamingos. It was all fantastic. There aren't many stores inside, but there are a few for shopping (even one just for adults with some fun stuff!) and only a few restaurants (I recommend dessert from the steakhouse). The Pizza Joint stayed open till 2am, but we were in bed before that every night.   You have to pay for the fitness center, but 30 flights of stairs are available for free. Save your money and run on the strip for free. Make sure to do it early because it sure gets HOT in Vegas. Spend that saved money on a show. The X Burlesque show was in the Flamingo and very, very sexy. Make sure to search for cheaper tickets online, and ask for discounts at the Players Club desk. The Total Rewards card you get will save you money in restaurants at other casinos, as well as the Flamingo. We also received free tickets to comedy shows and the Auto Collection showcase from the Players desk.  Spent a wonderful 5 days there and I already can't wait for the next stay here. Couldn't have asked for a better room for less than $100 a night! (A lot less with the deal we found!)

TRAVEL WITH US IF YOU LIKE GOING TO CVS A LOT  Three visits in 5 days. Yep. That's us.  Visit #1: Essentials for beauty.   He needed some new white undershirts so we figured buying them here is easier than packing into the carry-on ($2.50 each). I needed some nailpolish remover. My container at home exceeds the 4 oz carry-on limit ($1.99), travel sized shaving cream since the Flamingo pool was open ($2.19), whopper robin eggs ($2.99) as a snack for him, chili cheese fritos ($2.49) as a snack for me, and a bottle of Fancy Andre champagne, extra dry ($5.49).  Visit #2: Essentials for a good impression at the helicopter convention.  Altoids ($2.19) Bayer aspirin for the mystery pain in my walking foot ($3.19). Paper clips to attach business card to his resume ($2.99), some portfolios to carry the resumes in ($2.77 ea), and some generic Irish Cream for the morning coffees ($13.99).  Visit #3 Essentials - period. Vodka ($6.99) Cran ($4.19) Gel insoles for his tired feeties ($13.99)

THANKS FOR THE SAFE PARKING LOT!  If youre taking the freeway to get downtown, as you make your exit, you'll see a big (huge) sign that points to "Free parking" (with validation) at a giant, well-lit, attended lot. This is Main Street's parking and if you show your receipt inside they give you back the $3 cash that it cost to park there. So even if you DON"T take your receipt in, you're not out much money for a safe parking spot close to Fremont Street. Much less Shady than some of the garages in that area.  But please DO take your receipt in. This place is sooooo pretty inside. Even the food court caught my husband's eye and we turned around so I could see it too. It's extravangant and elegantly detailed and has something to see no matter where you look.  I haven't stayed here, but if I were planning on staying in this part of Vegas (as opposed to the strip) I'd stay at this hotel next. Plus, I want to check out their buffet. BUFFET!

CALLING ALL WHISKEY GIRLS AND AMERICAN GUYS  You're going to have to be a fan of country music to enjoy yourself here. A large screen playing music videos and some smaller ones all around with both tunes and NASCAR, will be the background noise to your dining experieince.  Loves it!  I first saw one of these places while driving through Nashville and have been wanting to eat here ever since!  The girls working are in chaps and the eye candy was excellent! Our server was Rhonda and she did a fantastic job. Totally on top of it and delivered great service through the whole meal. I ordered a house salad ($11.99) and when it arrived I could tell it would feed me another meal or two, so I asked for a to-go container before dressing it. She brought me one (which I filled with salad) and even brought me a lid for the extra dressing. They must get this a lot! The two cups of dressing were huge!  My husband had some sort of big club sandwich that he enjoyed ($15.99). We both had a drink and enjoyed the large mason jars - you don't have to check on a table as often because it takes longer to empty a drink (not sure why some places use such small glasses). With our check, Rhonda brought to-go cups as well and made sure our glasses were full.  When you're paying $3.50 for each glass this makes you feel a little better about it.  That's expensive beveraging!! Service was superior to most places of similar value. And it wasn't just her, we saw lots of hard-working employees and bussers. Everyone doing their job well and providing a pleasant dining atmosphere.   Sign up for a player's card! Your Total Rewards card from Flamingo works in the Harrah's Hotel where this Grill is. We didn't realize this and so we missed out on a couple of dollars savings from each meal. Bummer! They must be sister hotels - wish I'd known that it worked at more than one! It was too late by the time we figured this out.  ($37.81 for lunch)

MISS TACO TUESDAY WHILE ON VACATION? I DON'T THINK SO!  Remember the movie "Speed"? Where the bus has to go a minimum speed limit, or everyone dies? My life is kind of like that. I have to consume a minimum of one taco a week, or I die.  Well.... I'm not totally sure I would die, but I don't want to take any chances so I just keep eating away.   Paradise Cantina happens to be located next to CVS, and since we were becoming regulars there, we figured we'd check it out! Our server Jax did a good job taking care of our needs out on the front patio. She brought me delicious, probably life-saving tacos.  We ordered a basket of chips and salsa, as well as some margaritas. The guac that came with the chips was delicious! The salsa was very fresh too. And the tacos weren't bad, albeit pretty messy! (I put a safety bib on the husband.)  Spoke with some more friendly employees back inside on my way to the ladies room (which I happily found to be very clean!) I complimented their salsa and they informed me everything is made fresh daily. This pleases me.  In conclusion, let's think about the taco. MmmmMMMMmm; taco.  The word is the same in English and Spanish. How cool is that?! Taco.

FUN, FOOD, AND FANTASTIC MERMAID EMPLOYEES  Mermaids ended up being one of our favorite bars on Fremont. We walked in and were handed a raffle ticket for a cash drawing that is called every thirty minutes.  The numbers called for winners were never anything close to our number, I wonder how many of these raffle tickets actually have a winner!  I scoped the bar area with it's frozen treats, and husband immediately started looking around for the food he'd seen pictures of out front: fried twinkies and other goodies, and Nathan's Hot Dogs! After seeing the long line in the food area, and hearing the prices for frozen drinks, we decided to sit down at one of the nickel machines.  The max bet is fifteen cents and it's fun, even though it's quite simple. I enjoy that kind of gambling (from time to time.) A cashier in the back cashed in all the nickels the machine gives you when you cash out. (Don't expect a ticket here!) It's husband's favorite - who doesn't like the sound of actual money coming out of the machine! We didn't brave the food line the first night we were in there, but made a note to come back.   A couple of nights later, there we were again! Fun! More nickel gambling! The small casino was well-stocked with employees so drinks came out quick to the people betting their money. Not only were the girls working in cute outfits (like most casinos) but they were very friendly.  Even though neither of us were very hungry, we decided to get a few hot dogs. Not bad.  Overall, very cute casino for being so small - it was really warm inside but mostly near the back in the food area. Much nicer temp. near the front entrance.

GREAT CONCEPT; BAD EXECUTION  The idea of the Speakeasy style restaurant dining is great. The dining experience itself: not so much.  I had to laugh when reading "Steakhouse" on the menu because there just weren't that many steak options. Shrimp caught my eye in a few dishes, and the clams did also. We'd heard great things about the meatballs but I wanted seafood. It's an Italian place, right? Seafood and pasta sound easy enough.  Unfortunately, by 6 in the evening they were out of shrimp.  Choice number 2 wasn't a bad one though. I had the "Gallows with clams" in a red sauce. It was good and had a lot of clams. The sauce was tasty. Would have been good if I'd shared it over my husband's alfredo, because that was terrible. Flavorless sauce.  His meatball however was excellent. And very large; and tender! Exploding with flavor inside! I doubt we'll return here but it was fun to check out! I'd go with my clams again and he'd probably throw a meatball on top and share.  :)  A salad with a red sauce preceeded dinner and was very good. (Husband disliked the sauce). A tiramisu dessert finished up the evening and it was great too!  We had a Groupon but it still wasn't an inexpensive dinner, for what it was. You're partly paying for the experience though. It was fun dining in the dark. Service has room for improvement! We first heard about the place from a fake reality show that supposedly took place there. I wish Food Network would stop airing that crap, but I'm glad we had a chance to check out one of the places it supposedly featured!   If this restaurant fails I highly suggest the owner start a meatball production factory - freeze 'em and ship out! You have a guaranteed customer in California waiting for this day!

I GOT ID'ed LAST TIME I PURCHASED SPRAY PAINT  While walking down Fremont street it's fun to stop and watch each of the entertainers. Even if only for a minute. It's free to stop so why not catch a cool magic trick? Hear some great jazz live? Or watch a guy spray paint an awesome picture using newpaper as a paint brush?  There are a couple spray painting artists on the street now (not sure if they're working together, in separate areas along the street, or if they're independent of one another, but they do about the same thing:  Spray paint a paper and use natural tools to smear the image into something else. Hard to describe; fun to watch.   It's really amazing, some of the art that they produce!  My husband said he and some friends watched a how-to video on youtube (you can learn ANYTHING on youtube!) and that it wasn't as hard as you would think, but I guarantee this would still be too hard for me! I'm not all that artsy.  Beautiful pics at reasonable prices! At least worth watching, even if you're not planning on shipping something like that home! Don't forget to tip, if you're so inclined!

Stopped in this grocery store with my Phoenix friends before enjoying some time on the backyard patio. We picked up some fresh jicama, celery, hummus with herbs, and Pretzel Chips.  Store was clean and service was friendly. I even noticed in the produce department they had little Cuties (fruit) for kids to enjoy while shopping. And bags for the garbage. How nice!

The mall in Chandler has a pretty decent food court, but I just wanted something small and simple before heading to the airport, so I went with a single shrimp taco from Rubio's. Taco took an absurdly long time to come out (I was the only person waiting on food), but the buzzer buzzed several minutes later and I collected my taco. It was delicious!  Salsa bar was clean and chips and salsa were good.

MY FAVORITE!  When my husband and I travelled to Vegas together for the first time I was literally shocked he didn't know about the downtown. Fremont is my favorite! The Fremont Street Experience is free, fun, and very memorable. Plus, when the screen isn't playing its show up above, you can look around you and there are costumed "celebrities" EVERYWHERE. If you don't want to tip them to take a picture together, try a perfectly aimed "selfie" with them in the deliberate background.  Food is good on Fremont. Drinks are cheap. Streets are packed. There are stages with live performances, zip lines, and I even saw a motorcycle ball of death once. ONe of the greatest things I've ever seen live! Plus, this area is rich with history. I've only stayed in a downtown hotel a couple times. Stay on the strip, but take a cab to Fremont and enjoy the experience.

SO EASY AN OUT-OF-TOWNER CAN DO IT  The last thing I want to do when I get into town on vacation is wait in a long time. Or be confused. Or be confused while waiting in a long line. Lucky for my husband none of the bad things happened. We departed from our plane (thanks, Virgin Airlines, for the safe flight!) Grabbed our overhead baggage and headed out of the terminal to a bus that said "rental car transport".  Three other passengers boarded with us and the driver shut the door, even though we weren't nearly full. Sweeeet. I hate waiting.  It wasn't long before we were going through a dark tunnel and my husband made a kidnapping joke. I started to ponder how easy it would be to kidnap someone: 1) buy a bus; 2) paint "rental car bus" on the side. Done. Just at that moment, a prerecorded message sang out from the bus speakers noting that we were almost to the rental center and an additional bus would be available if we didn't find the company we were looking for.   Thrifty Aunto Rental was right up front. The bus driver helped us with our luggage (on the way there he did - at the end of the trip a different driver was much less helpful). All in all it was great door to door service. Err, auto to plane.

I don't know what disappointed us more here: the service or the food?! Perhaps the poor service wins this battle, since the initial interaction with our server set the mood. I imagine we're not the first people to stay at Excalibur who decide to use the $20 credit here, since it's not valid at their buffet. We weren't going to waste the credit at a bar, where drinks are free if you're gambling. My husband and I stopped in here a little less than two hours before the Jersey Boys show, playing down the Strip at Paris. Doors to the show open half an hour early and we were going to walk there, so we knew we'd only have time for appetizers which was fine with us.  We presented our $20 credit upon ordering, as required, and told the servers we had a show to get to. He then asked when it was, and when we told him insisted we had time for entrees and rolled his eyes at us when we declined. I get in big trouble with hubby when I do this, and he was most unhappy at the unprofessional gesture from our server.   Bread was brought to the table as we waited for sliders for my husband, a Caesar salad for me, and seasoned fries to share. Although my husband ordered the sliders rare, and we are really comfortable with steaks cooked less-than-rare, the ground beef was cold and uncooked in the center of his sliders, and his caramelized onions were uncooked as well. The seasoned fries were unseasoned and a thick cut fry without much flavor. My Caesar salad was server without fresh pepper offered for it, and the croutons seemed like they were found in an old box, rather than house-made.   Overall, the food disappointed but the service was the worst. We have no plans to stay at the Excalibur again, and without the free $20 credit for guests of the hotel, we won't be returning here either. They only get two stars because the hostess at the front was the only friendly face we encountered (she was super), and when we told her about the subpar experience as we left, she honestly wanted to make it right, but we assured her our decision to never return was everyone's fault but hers.

DRIVE IT LIKE YOU STOLE IT  I love cars. I especially love classic cars. My daily driver is a 1966 Mustang. Plus, my dad raced Cobras and Shelbys ('65 and '66) during my childhood so I have a serious love for classic cars and still enjoy watching vintage auto racing at the local tracks. So when an employee at the Flamingo Hotel gave us free tickets to check out this collection I was really excited.   My husband knew more about most of the cars we saw than I did but we both had a great time walking around. Lots of cars dated to the 1930s and were very unique. Had a couple historic racing cars and some police and medical responder vehicles.   Our favorite car was easily figured out. Husband loves the movie "Gone in 60 Seconds" and I love Mustangs. Eleanor is a 1967 Mustang (it's from the movie's remake). The original movie used a 1971 Mustang that was remodeled to look like a 1973. So pretty.  The showroom was very large and circled around in a couple different rooms. The A/C was working fine (I see this is a problem in a couple reviews).  Even though our tickets were free, I wouldn't have been upset to pay $10 pp, but probably not more than that. Not sure how much regular tickets were, or tickets with the AAA discount.  A small gift shop is connected to the showcase and has old Car Magazines, books, and standard gift shop toys and drinks and t-shirts.

YUMMMM!  Every year around the holidays, companies that our business works with start sending us baked treats. Our law firm represents public agencies, many of whom cannot receive gifts of any kind, but the ones that can, also give them out. See's Candy, various cookies, boxed treats, and these F***** incredible brownies, from the building's management company where our suite is located!!! They're the best treat we get every year! (In my opinion anyhow - and I'm not much of a sweets person most of the time!)  There are lots of flavors. I enjoy the caramel the most but they are all pretty good. We end up cutting them up and taking little bites all day from the community table in the kitchen. They're rich, so eating a whole one at once is pretty indulgent.  Great gift, especially since they're individually wrapped and packaged nicely. If you don't live near enough someone make a homemade baked treat as a present, these make a great substitute. Especially for an office with several people - the box we receive lasts a few days, (which says something for our group!!) A not in the box says something along the lines that if you can resist finishing them within the first week arrived, refrigerate or freeze. Which is always a good sign - anything that lasts for a long time freaks me out. Except Twinkies.

LOCALS JOINT  Out-of-towners visiting Vegas can easily miss out on good bars off the strip since it's so easy to just walk from bar to bar and enjoy the crowds on the street!  I have a cousin that lives in Vegas and he suggested we meet here for a drink.  I looked over the menu and a couple of items caught my eye, but we ended up just grabbing a couple Bud Lights ($7.00 ea).    Service was great. We sat outside near some heating lamps, which was awesome since there was a cold wind.  It wasn't until it was almost time to go that we noticed another area (straight ahead when you walk in, rather than to the right, where we were). It was a huge room with two more bars!  The place was pretty empty but I imagine it's very, very fun on the right night! Though, I'd probably bring a flask unless I hit up the long happy hour!

I'm pretty sure today was the first time I've eaten at a Ruby Tuesday. My aunt & my 2 cousins & I stopped in for a late lunch after all flying in to the Phoenix Airport.  One of my cousins ordered the shrimp trio plate for $20 and it looked soo good. Especially the large, fried shrimp. Another cousin had the turkey burger with sweet potato fries. Fries were crunchy and delicious and I ate part of her burger, which was really good too. My aunt had the grilled tilapia which I didn't try, but the broccoli on the side of her plate was perfectly steamed and very tasty. I ordered the salad bar for myself. ($8 of you order independently or $3 with your meal). Tons of fresh crisp veggies, lots of great toppings, & a good choice of salad dressings. I loaded up my plate and left very full.

VIVA LAS FOUNTAINS  Our upcoming Vegas trip in two weeks will certainly include several viewings of the Bellagio fountain show. I could endlessly watch this and be entertained. The spraying water dances in time to a variety of songs with music set to the rhythm. This trip we'll be staying at the Flamingo, so I'm excited to note that the Fountains are at the Strip + Flamingo intersection! Woot woot!  I love water. Who doesn't?! To get to see something like this is really incredible - youtube videos sort of capture the magic but are nothing like seeing it live and outdoors - even from inside a hotel it's just not the same (but still pretty neat). And it's free.  Hours of operation: *Monday - Friday: 3 p.m. - 7 p.m. (with shows every half hour), 7 p.m. - midnight (with shows every 15 minutes). *Weekends and holidays: Noon - 7 p.m. (with shows every half hour), 7 p.m. - midnight (with shows every 15 minutes).  Note: Every Sunday for Jasmine's "Fountain Brunch," show times begin at 11 a.m. and run every 15 minutes.

PLENTY OF OTHER GOOD CASINO BARS IN THIS CASINO  I love little casino bars. When the service is good and drinks are at least standard.  This bar makes it awkward for the bartenders to be friendly or to even be bartenders. The seats at the bar seem very far from where the bartenders stand. We had trouble getting the bartenders attention and didn't receive friendly service when we did. The drinks we received were as expected and I wasn't sitting in the Flamingo trying to make new friends so the gamblers around me didn't bother me. I enjoy the gambling machines on the bar. I'd rather play on the Bugsy Bar near, also inside the Flamingo near the strip entrance. Friendly bartenders and a more lively atmosphere. Drinks were pretty watered down at both spots, but we bring our own alcohol in Vegas, so they're usually the perfect strength with a little doctoring.

We use their services at our office in Northern CA. They send a woman to give us our flu shots every year. Had no problems with payment or scheduling. The biggest problem is not crying when someone tries to put a needle in my arm. I try to tough it out, since I get my flu shot at work, and I don't want to appear weak with my coworkers around... but I usually end up asking to hold someone's hand.  They lose a star for not providing stickers and suckers to us when we're done; like my doctor does when I get a shot.

We stopped in here and loved browsing all the autographed memorabilia. It wasn't just music-oriented, but had picture collages from TV shows (NCIS) and movies (Animal House) as well.  All out of (above) our budget, but fun to view. Unfortunately, no photographs are allowed inside  the gallery (they lose one star for that), but definitely a fun stop while we were there. We very much enjoyed walking around and checking out the awesome items.  They also had a former Chicago Bears player signing autographs, but we didn't take advantage of that since it also had a price tag.

I'LL HAVE ONE BREAKFAST MCMUFFIN, HOLD THE GUNFIRE  If you're in Vegas for an event at the Convention Center, you'll probably be up early enough for breakfast. If you're not there on work, you might just want to sleep through this part of the day. McDonald's breakfast is not sold nearly long enough. I never make it there on time! How hard would it be to serve eggs all day?!!  In any case, this McD's is convenient to the convention center.  We stopped here more than once on our last Vegas trip a couple months back. On one of the visits while dining in, we noticed a bullet hole in the window from the night before. Someone probably mad about breakfast not being served all day is my guess.  Service was good. Food was average. The coolest thing about this location was the deco. It was so modern inside. Clean and cool. I like that.

I LOVE YOU, LV  Vegas is definitely one of my happy places. Good food, good drinks, good eye candy. It's a place for the adults. A giant playground of awesome.   Personally, I'm more of a Fremont Vegas than Strip Vegas person. I love the old downtown Experience. But many fun night have been had walked the main street as well.   My cousins have lived in Vegas for many years. Perhaps they are more responsible than I, because I'm sure living there is not a good idea for me. Although, I think work would be easy to find. Go-go dancing is probably out of the question, but I could open up one of those touristy gun places, where you can shoot automatic weapons in the desert. And husband could give the helicopter ride out there. Perhaps we'd do just fine in Vegas.  But for now, it's just a great vacation spot. I wish I were poolside at the Flamingo right now!  Viva!

I planned a trip to Vegas with my husband last year purely to visit the Wicked Spoon. I bought a new pair of buffet pants for the occasion and booked our flights! :) I also wanted to see the Cat Circus perform while we were there, but they were out of town. We settled for Jersey Boys show, and that was good, but not as good as our dinner at this buffet.  The buffet was seriously the highlight of our trip. We spent almost two hours eating our little hearts out. So, so good! I thought I was done eating at one point, but as my husband made round after round to the dessert table, I decided not to admit defeat and had to try a couple sweets of my own. It felt like an accomplishment to walk out of there without assistance when it was all over; fat and happy!  For all the variety though, I felt like they didn't have very many seafood options. There was a delicious shot of ceviche that is very memorable, but I like seafood the most and I was surprised they didn't have more fish plates. All in all though, I'm a buffet person and this place is doing it right!

I made the wrong food decision the other night; Auntie Anne's would've been the right one. Instead, I had to watch my husband eat his pretzel-wrapped hot dog while I ate oily, over-cooked green beans from Pick Up Stix next door.  It was awful. http://www.yelp.com/biz/pick-up-stix-las-vegas-6#hrid:Kt_Lms6DPLzceFljZvS8sQ  While I ate my food I watch hubby enjoy his hot dog/pretzel ($5.39). I should have just ordered a pretzel by itself. With lots of mustard. Would've been much healthier and much more enjoyable. The bite of pretzel I had from him was great. Especially since we were eating at midnight.  This might be one of the better food options in the Excalibur Food Court.

FREE BOXES FOR PRIORITY SHIPPERS  I do a lot of shipping and mailing at work. I make several visits to the Post Office in Walnut Creek every week. After stopping at one Post Office that was closed for lunch, we made our way here to send a package of our stuff, back home to us. This post office had everything we needed to get our treasures home. Well, they didn't have the sticker label for addressing like I usually use, but it's probably less wasteful to just write on the box anyhow. So that's exactly what I did.  While in line, I helped an elderly woman fill out a certified mailing order with return receipt. These can be confusing if you don't use them all of the time.  She appreciated the help and when I was done it was my turn to pay. The employee took the flat rate charge (approx. $12) and our package was home safely in two days.   Well done, post office!

DESSERT MENU, PLEASE  It was our fourth day in Vegas and we had walked by Center Cut countless times, since it is located right next to the elevators for our part of the Flamingo Hotel. An electronic screen displaying menu items and specials had caught our eyes each night, along with the well-dressed women greeting the diners.   The hostess station was out front of the doors to the restaurant. A bar was also in this area with lots of comfy seating. We had just had creme brulee the night before at Eiffel restaurant and so it hadn't even crossed my mind to sit down for dessert again. But I'm so glad we did!   We sat in the bar area at a small table with very low chairs. I think Ted was our server and he did a great job. The only thing we ordered was the creme brulee and it was very good! $8.00 with our Total Rewards card and it was a good-sized serving. I imagine if we had stopped in at an earlier point in our trip, we would have come back a second time, since it was so convenient to the room!

NO SERVICE, NO SALSA, NO SMILE  We had walked by several times and finally decided to stop one night when the music wasn't so loud and the bar wasn't packed. We didn't want to fight for a table so it was a good time, late at night. All we wanted was chips and salsa. We sat at the bar but quickly grew impatient as we weren't noticed.  Once we finally received our menus the bartender had left to do something. I forget what they were asking for the chips and salsa but we'd been told it was just one salsa, (no "hot" option; no "verde" option) so for whatever the price was we didn't think it was worth it and ended up walking out.   Didn't even get a goodbye.  Note: We did however have a great time another night taking pictures on the four stools as you enter. Fun stuff!

Stopped in to get some more money, which while in Vegas might imply we've gone through lots of money already but we've still only spent under$100 between two people and it's day 3, so we're doing alright. Just wanted more cash for tips and the like.   This Chase was easy to find and not far from the main strip. Easy parking lot to get in and out of and up-close parking. ATMs in a front area but we went into the branch and were greeted by two friendly employees.  I made some coffee while husband completed the financial transaction stuff. And then in only a few minutes, we were off for more adventures with money in our pockets again. Thanks, Chase!

ITS HARD TO SHIP A FLAT RATE BOX WITHOUT THE BOX  Realizing that our two bag limit for carry-on items was going to be difficult to keep, we decided that we should ship a box home. Not a lot of stuff, and nothing important, just some documents and swag from the convention we attended. And some sandals, soap, hotel lotions, etc.  Decided to leave the alcohol behind. I hope someone at the auto rental place enjoys the vodka because we put it in the front seat for them. Next to the dirty car door they rented us.  Unfortunately, after finding this location of USPS we stopped by and it was closed up. Lunch from 1-2 is fine but they had NO supplies available inside. Perhaps I'm spoiled here in Walnut Creek. Our USPS has supplies and stickers, tape, pens... all sorts of goodies and most available after-hours, as they are located in the area with P.O. Boxes. Boxes for flat-rate shipping are always available at the home office. And they don't close for lunch. Of course this is not the case while on vacation.  Thanks a lot, USPS. Now we get to drive around some more. If your location is too small to stay open for lunch, perhaps it's not absolutely necessary to keep it open at all. Especially as the federal government is trying to cut USPS hours anyhow.

On our last Vegas trip at the beginning of this year I had a craving for tacos. This is nothing new, it happens to me all the time. Thank goodness for a smart phone that helps me with my late-night cravings.  On this particular evening, the craving struck around 11:45 p.m.. We'd already walked around the limited food options at Excalibur's food court, so when we saw DJ's wasn't that far from our hotel we set out on foot.  Running. Then walking fast. Then running again.  We made it up to their window with a minute to spare and were greeted by a couple glances at their clock.    They (thankfully) made us each a couple of tacos and we enjoyed them in the open-air plaza outside their establishment. Tables and chairs and napkins were set up and we enjoyed our food before walking past the dark restaurant back to our hotel.  A couple nights later we returned for more tacos, at a more decent hour.  We went inside this time.  Honestly, the tacos were better the first night. Or maybe they weren't; and I just wanted them more the first night, and I thought they were better because they satisfied my need. But either way, they were good tacos for Vegas tacos!  We never plan to stay at the Excalibur again, but if we're walking around this part of the strip and come across DJ's again I'd definitely make room for a taco or two.

As we walked around the food court at Excalibur, I noticed someone carrying a tremendous, golden brown, crispy-fried corn dog. Hello, delicious food on a stick! I wasn't really in a "hot dog mood".  I never am, to be honest, but after giving up on the other lack of options, we went back to look at the menu.   Holy veggie hot dog! What are you doing up there??!! I had no idea this place also fries up veggie dogs. On a stick. In golden brown, fried dough!  I was a little reluctant. Would it look the same? How would it taste? I didn't know, but I gave it a shot and hot diggity dog I'm glad I did.  Yum yum yum.    While the veggie dog (mine)($3.69) and beef dog (husband's)($4.39) were cooked in the same fryer, I thought about the surprising fact that the veggie dog was less expensive! How is that possible?!  We ordered a fry to share ($2.79) and a Light Lemonade (with sugar substitute) ($3.69 for large)  Everything was really good. We were the last customer of the night or else I probably would've ordered another dog, even though I really wasn't that hungry after the first one.  I wish EVERY food establishment would have a veggie option. Most of the time it's going to be a very tasty, healthier, guilt-free treat.  I do eat meat, but if there's a veggie option, I always take it! Glad I did here, The food was great!

Just under$4 for a one-item craving at midnight isn't a bad deal. Husband and I circled the Excalibur food court on foot a couple of times before I settled on fast-Asian (over McD's, Popeye's, Schlotzky's, a smoothie place, Krispy Kreme, or Auntie Anne's).  Having no other meatless options I ordered just the fried green beans. They looked so over fried I sampled one first (samples are free, just ask). Thinking I could handle a full order I went for it. I finished off the night's supply. ($3.77)  A couple oil-soaked napkins later and a LOT of oily sauce at the bottom of my container and I ditched the beans for a much healthier donut. (Not kidding. Def healthier).   Friendly service, especially for the time off night, but at least have one mixed vegetable option! (No, veggie fried rice doesn't count). I regret my food and restaurant choices.

OH! WHAT A PITY! WHEN COFFEE TASTES SH*TTY  What I really want at some coffee places is a 12 oz. whipped cream with some coffee on top. When the beverage isn't great, why not get something you do enjoy?! Like a cup of whipped cream. That's what I should have done because the drink we ordered at Java Detour was either made incorrectly or was just all around awful. We didn't even finish it and I hate being wasteful.  Nino was behind the register and very friendly, even when we pointed out the incorrect drink size. We declined an offer for a new drink and went on our merry way, wishing there'd been more whipped cream.

PINK! PINK! PINK! FLAMINGO!  There is so much pink inside the Flamingo - this bar especially! The downstairs area at FLAMINGO opens to the strip; I don't think It even has doors! People walking by can view the gambling tables and go-go dancers above them.  Also near this part of the hotel is Bugsy's Bar. The cute bar has seating all around it's circular shape.  We've stopped at the Flamingo before and met friends for drinks here. They're comped if you're gambling on the machines (minimume $5 must be in the machine). I usually stick to Blackjack and can walk away without spending very much and a cold drink in hand! A well drink will cost you $7.50 (plus tax = $8.11) if you're not gambling. There are buy one-get one coupons for casino bars that can be found at various spots in the hotel. So hopefully you have two friends hands if you're paying full price.  After going for a run on the strip one of the mornings we were there, I made it back to our hotel and stopped here for a glass of ice water. I stopped at a second bar before making it to the room. It was hot out! Glad water's free!

I'm so happy that Firefly moved and didn't close. I have loved visiting this place as long as I've been coming to Vegas (long time). Their Padron peppers are my favorite menu item and they did not disappoint today! A full plate of peppers flash fried with lemon and sea salt was $5.50 - a really unbeatable price compared to anywhere else. We also had fries with Parmesan seasoning and that's the only plate that at all disappointed me. The serving was very large but the fries were soft and not crispy, even though they were skinny and browned. Lots of yummy shaved cheese though!  Husband enjoys the ham and cheese croquetas ($5) and had a soda also (coke $2.50). I tried a new plate this time and went with the chili, lime garbanzo beans (in the shell!) ($4.50) I didn't even know they came in a shell (but it makes sense) so I asked the server what they're like. He compared them to edamame but these little pods were much more difficult to work the beans out of. I liked them a lot but they were a lot of work for too little reward.   The new restaurant is wonderful. Much bigger and still a great location. There is parking in the back, but if you miss the driveway on the way in, be sure to not park in the subsequent parking lot, as we were told they are happy to tow you.  $25.41 for amazing tapas for two

The guy working seemed surprised when I asked if they sold bottles of alcohol. This isn't that kind of Spirits place. They do serve food and drink though. Smoking is permitted inside and they have several little spots to sit and gamble. A breakfast croissant with egg, sausage, and cheese was only $1.99, but we ended up going somewhere else.

(corrected Thrifty location - original review 3/7/13)  OH HELLO, VOMIT ON THE INSIDE PASSENGER DOOR  Asking myself where this review should begin, I decided to back way up in the trip planning. We went back and forth on whether or not it was necessary to rent a vehicle. There were two of us travelers. We didn't plan on drinking much while in Vegas so not worried about DUI, but did plan on going to Fremont Street, so lots of cab fare. Had a convention with a $10 parking lot and our hotel had a monorail station for $5. Lots of back and forth. When we finally concluded that it would be slightly more convenient to rent a car, we started searching for deals online.   Found a discount code for Thrifty Auto Rental from Orbitz (I think) that stated an additional 6% savings. Husband did all the work online while on the phone with me, setting up our reservation. But he couldn't find a place to enter the discount code. Please be user friendly when making a webpage. So we figured we'd reserve the car with his credit card and bring the discount code along with us when we picked up the car.   Jerome was working the counter in Las Vegas and must have been having a really bad day. He was unfriendly and unhelpful. I'm a big believer in coupons and discounts and saving of the money. So naturally we brought up the code and pulled up the page on my husband's phone, with the discount confirmation number. We explained we couldn't apply this when paying and he snapped that "if we couldn't do it, he wouldn't be able to either." It was rude and unhelpful.  We went upstairs to the garage and picked up a Kia Soul. For just over $100 for five days of minimal driving it was an okay deal. Nothing special. The tank was full and I walked the vehicle, taking pictures of all dings and scrapes. I didn't think to look inside before we left. It wasn't until the next day that I saw the passenger door. What the &#$^%!! Is that vomit? A half-hearted attempt to clean the sticky, disgusting mess had been made and I made another go at it. We immediately pulled over but it didn't come off very nicely. So for five days I sat in the seat consciously reminding myself not to let my right knee touch the door.   Upon returning the vehicle I pointed out the filthy door to the nice woman who checked us in. She said we should have called and we could have returned and had the car replaced. Cuz that's how I want to spend my vacation. Driving around because some employee didn't do their job? Perhaps if she'd said my call would have brought another car to me to trade... but I wasn't about to waste gas and time anyhow. Instead, I'll double check for gross interiors before leaving the parking lot.

Inside the mall in Chandler, AZ is a small JJ kiosk. Julian was working the day my Aunt and two cousins and I were walking around the mail before heading back to California. We stopped at the kiosk and ordered an Orange Dream Machine (medium - $5.89), Tropical Pitaya Smoothie with extra soy protein (large - $6.79) and two 1 oz wheetgrass shots ($2.79 each).  Even though he was the only employee working and there was a little line, our drinks came out fast and were delicious. Even received a slice of fruit with the wheatgrass! $20.01 for our group's healthy snack before lunch.
