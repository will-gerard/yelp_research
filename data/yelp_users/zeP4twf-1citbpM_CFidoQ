Have been here a few times and they never disappoint! Such amazing food and service. The staff is very friendly, family owned. The place is immaculate and very clean. The decor is wonderful. It's hard to find a good Thai place as clean as this. The food is wonderful too. Lunch specials is a great price ranging from $8-$12. They have a soup of the day that's always amazing. I love their coconut ice cream also. I always want to go to this place when in the area and hungry for Thai food! It's always busy when I come in. Don't be angry if the staff isn't that attentive they are just busy but very nice people! Love this place and love Thai food.

I love this place and especially the fact that their kitchen is open until 2am!! The crab puffs are super yummy I get them every time I'm here. The decor is unique for a Chinese restaurant and I love it. The owners are awesome too! One is always behind the bar and he's really friendly. Thursday nights are stand up comedy and it's great.

Had such high hopes for this place! Yelp reviews and pictures made it look like a superb little place for lunch. When we walked in the decor was lovely. Was expecting a larger pastry selection(being used to real French cafes they have a huge colorful selection!) the items displayed in the cases looked old and store bought. Macarons are meant to be in a refrigerated case so seeing them in little baggies on the counter was quite weird. My significant other ordered a $14.95 black truffle burger and it was definitely not worth the price. The bottom bun was soggy and looked gross. I told him to send it back but he felt bad. I ordered the Brie sandwich and my salad didn't even come with the dressing or any tomatoes like in the pictures or like my boyfriends meal. He had to walk up to the counter to get dressing and we never got a refill on our drinks so the service was horrible. Won't be coming back here.

I really enjoy living at the glen it's the perfect location and the pricing is great. Electricity is inexpensive every month even though we keep our apartment at 65 everyday! The updated clubhouse is really nice and so are the pools (there are multiple pools). The apartments are nice and clean. I can't wait to upgrade to Visconti at the end of our lease! I would recommend this complex you just can't beat the price and location! Perfect for students attending Scottsdale community college or even ASU. also it's close to everything you need and many job opportunities in this area.
