Arriba has been one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix, but tonight I have really had to examine my love of this restaurant. It has been at least 6 months since I ate there and I was really excited about going back. I was seated in the back room. I immediately noticed that it looked like it needed a deep cleaning. My table was clean, but the walls and the areas surrounding the cheesy nature scenes in the back were filthy. The service was good, and my meal came quickly. As I was eating, something caught my eye not far from my table in the nature scene plants. It was a set mousetrap. This really turned my stomach. The food that I was eating was great as usual, but it really creeped me out that the place was so dirty and that they apparently had a rodent problem. My advice to the owners is to bring in a professional cleaning team and for heaven's sake don't leave mousetraps out for the patrons to see.

I had a great experience at Spinato's Saturday night. The food and service was awesome. We started out with garlic and cheese breadsticks with marinara. Orgasimic. :) There were three of us dining, and we ordered three different things to share. I have had their meatball pizza several times, and it is my absolute favorite. We also tried the baked spaghetti and meatball calzone with ricotta. Oh my! This calzone was like heaven in your mouth. It was awesome, but a tad on the rich side. A few bites of this were enough to share. We also got an Italian sausage and mushroom pizza. It was also extremely good. Our server was fantastic. She was attentive, and was very helpful in explaining items on the menu. On top of all of this, it was very affordable.

Today we had a going away luncheon for a coworker at Floridino's. Most of us ordered off of the luncheon menu. For around $7 the items were a great value. Even though they were slammed at lunch time and we had a large group, we had excellent service.   I had the two item calzone with sausage and ricotta. It was just ok. I just thought it was dry and didn't have a lot of taste.   On a previous visit i had the Pizza Muffins. They were awesome! I would highly recommend those instead of the calzone.

I enjoy going to the Phoenix Public Market on Saturday mornings. I buy from a variety of different vendors, but Arizona Bread Company is always my first stop. I am addicted to the Kalamata Olive bread.  It never disappoints. I love it toasted with a little butter, or even as a sandwich. I also enjoy brushing it with some olive oil, cutting it up into squares, and toasting it to make croutons. They actually sometimes make it into my salads.  I highly recommend this and the other breads they offer.

I am a big fan of the green chile. I have never really had good service here, but the good food makes me not mind as much. I had lunch there today. The food was served less than 5 minutes after I ordered it. The food was hot and fresh. However, the server never asked how the food was or asked if I would like a drink refill. If you are looking for good food then I recommend it. If you are all about great service then skip it.

Nick's has been a pretty popular gathering place for a group of my friends. I have had their pizzas, calzones,  and chicken parmesan. Those dishes have been pretty good.   Last night I wanted to try something new, so I tried the baked ziti with meatballs. I don't recommend it. The issue was that it was overcooked. The ziti was rubbery and the dish was dry. The ends of the ziti were hard and crunchy. The best thing about the dish was the meatballs.   Even though my food was not up to par, the service was exceptionally good.

I am pretty new to Indian cuisine. I have only had it a few times at parties, or events at work. I have liked most of what I have tried. A few months ago Groupon offered a deal for The Dhaba, and based on a recommendation from a friend I decided to take advantage of the offer. Guess What? I totally forgot  until a day or two before the offer ran out. So, I quickly got a group together and made reservations for Thursday night which was the final night of the offer.   When we arrived it was apparent that I was not the only doofus that waited until the last night. The restaurant was packed, and people were outside waiting. The hostess was actually turning people without  reservation away. I was so glad that I had made a reservation, because we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. The downside was that we waited over 20 minutes for a server to come to our table.  My group decided to order three appetizers and three main dishes.   Appetizers: * Paneer pakora * Punjabi murgh (chicken) pakora * Punjabi vegetable platter featuring veggie and paneer pakora.  THE WINNER: The Punjabi vegetable platter.  We laughed saying they tasted like Bloomin' Onions only different. The chicken was also very good, but the paneer pakora was a bit bland.  Main Entrees:  * Dhaba chicken korma  * Dhaba lamb curry * Achari lamb.   THE WINNER: Dhaba Chicken korma.  It was so creamy and had a rich nutty flavor. I felt bad. I really didn't want to share.  Both of the lamb dishes were good, but I found them to be excessively salty. The Achari Lamb was way to spicy for my taste.  The service was ok given that they were understaffed and extremely busy, but I will let this slide since I waited until the last night to use the Groupon deal. I will tell you. I am a Dhaba fan, and I will definitely go back.

My dog Rocco goes crazy if we even drive by Second Home. He absolutely loves going there. I sometimes feel bad, because he looks sad when I get there to pick him up. The staff is great, and they all seem to know him by name when he arrives.   I have used Second Home for boarding and for daycare.  I recommend both. My dog is extremely hyperactive, and after a day of playing at daycare he comes home and curls up and sleeps for hours. To me that is worth the price of daycare. The first time I used boarding there, I had a geriatric dog. They were so great with her too.  I have used the big box pet boarding and daycare before, and I was shocked to learn that the brand named store kept the dogs inside the entire day. I know with Second Home that they get to go outside to play, and they even get to play in the dog water park. They are supervised at all times.   My only suggestion to Second Home would be to expand their hours. On weekdays they close at 6PM. This can be a hardship for me since I drive from work in Chandler. Their weekend hours are limited, so if I plan on  doing a weekend trip I have to make sure I am back on Sunday between 11AM and 2PM to pick up my dog.

I had the pleasure of trying out Short Leash Dogs at Ignite 10. I had a bratwurst slider. The slider was a bratwurst  served on a pretzel roll with sauerkraut and cheese. That combination was awesome. It was the perfect balance of sweet, savory, and salty.  The sauerkraut was the best I have had since I visited Germany. It was sweet and in combination with the cheese the slider just melted in my mouth. When I think of sliders I think of small portions, but this one was rich and filling. I highly recommend Short Leash Dogs. I can't wait to try their other menu items.

I am truly a pulled pork snob. Smoked pork flavor should be the star of the show. If you cook pulled pork right it should need very little sauce. Finally, the flavor of the slaw should work together with the taste of the pork to make my taste buds happy.   The Carolina Style Pulled Pork Sandwich on the menu grabbed my attention. I love how the vinegar in Carolina sauce brings out the smoked pork taste. Since I like to control the amount of sauce I use, I ordered the sauce on the side. The waitress informed me that when they pull the pork, that they soak it in the sauce. This was a red flag to me, but being open minded I still decided to try it.  I was served in less than 5 minutes. When I got my sandwich, what I saw disappointed me. That pork had been pulled, chopped, slapped, and smacked. It was not immediately recognizable as pork. The sauce totally overpowered the taste of the meat. It was a really sweet sauce, and it was like eating liquid brown sugar. The slaw didn't really have any flavor at all.   So, I was disappointed with the pulled pork, but the service was excellent. The waitress was quick, attentive, and was able to answer all of my questions about the menu.   Will I go back? Probably. The food looked and smelled really good. It may have been a different experience if I had ordered the ribs or brisket.

Tonight I had the pleasure of trying out JoBot Coffee. This trendy coffee house totally lives up to the hype for their crepes. I had the Nutella and Banana Crepe. What's not to love? It was perfect. It had just enough Nutella to give it that great hazelnut and chocolate taste. I worried that it was be caked with Nutella making it too rich to eat, but that was not the case. The bananas were great too. This was my first time at JoBot and the barista was very helpful in recommending the sweet peach tea, and the crepe.   This place is very cool. It is an old house that was converted first into a bicycle shop and then the coffee house. One room has a living room type atmosphere, and there was ample seating outside. I will definitely go back to try the savory crepes and coffee.

I live very close to this location of Julioberto's and I have eaten at this location several times. The food has always been fast and good. However my experience last night changed my opinion of the restaurant. I am solely basing my review on this experience.   Last night I went through the drive-thru and when I came to the window, I noticed individual styrofoam cups sitting on top of the soda fountain. A few seconds later I saw an employee drinking out of a styrofoam cup. He took a few sips, and then poured out the rest of his cup into the soda fountain drain below the dispensers. That freaked me out a bit, but not as much as what happened next.   He then rinsed out his cup using the water dispenser on the fountain. He sloshed it around and then poured out the contents. The contents splashed all over the dispenser and into the ice maker that was just below the drain. He then placed his drinking cup on top of the dispenser with the rest of the styrofoam cups. Water was still dripping off the side of the cup and on to the fountain.  A second later another employee started filling my cup with ice from the same ice maker.    When I expressed disgust at what I had just observed, I was told, "It is okay."  I am not sure that she understood what I was trying to tell her, because she was confused as to why I no longer wanted a soda. The lack of hygiene appalled me. I won't be back.
