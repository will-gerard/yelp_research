They had Kool Aid! i was so happy to see it :)  The chicken and waffles were really good... my girlfriend and I went straight there from the airport, before going to our hotel, and it was completely worth it...   yeah, waiting outside in 100 degree heat isn't ideal, but for 10 minutes you can deal with it... especially when they had someone outside giving out water  If you're ever in Phoenix like us, or live out there, definitely stop in!!!

So let me start off by saying that when I looked at this place, I looked at it through they eyes of a chef from the SF Bay... I wondered if a 28 Zagat rating in Phoenix is the same as in SF... I can't speak for other places, but in the case of Nobuo at Teeter House, it absolutely does! I would put that food up against anything I've eaten out here, or could make myself  I was there with my girlfriend for her birthday... we arrived a few minutes early for our reservation which wasn't a problem for them (which is always nice) Our waiter was super friendly and conscious but not overbearing... he was great  We got a couple of cocktails (both were really good) with our starters... let me back up... we got starters, small bites and hot dishes...   We got kimchi, the watermelon salad and nasu... I love kimchi, i could eat it with every meal... but theirs was great... the watermelon salad was exceptional... the nasu was something special... after the first round of starters we ordered a bottle of wine and got down to our our meal...   we started with the grapefruit hamachi and the shiromi carpaccio... i am not a fan of truffle oil... usually people overdo it because "oh my god, it's truffle oil... it's so good!!!" they used enough on the hamachi that it would be there, but not there... just enough to accent the dish. I do however love yuzu and they used it brilliantly on the carpaccio...   next we ordered entrees... the warm duck salad and karei karaage. The warm duck salad was simple, but lovely... grilled escarole is really nice when it's charred, but not cooked to much... not everyone likes the bitterness of the leaf, but it was a nice accompaniment to the duck and the sauce... the karei karaage was something else... first, it looked really cool... they fried the bones and made a basket to hold the pieces of fish... nice touch... also you can eat the bones, which were great, and the sauce was cool and refreshing.   after this we were still hungry... we overheard "oysters and uni" so we asked our waiter about the oysters and got those, along with tako and tomato. The oysters were along the same lines as all the other food... the octopus however, was a complete departure from the rest of the menu... which was not a bad thing at all  octopus, tomato and mozzarella belongs somewhere from Spain to Greece (just change the kind of cheese)... having it at an Japanese influenced restaurant was a pleasant surprise, and shows the outlook of the chef... that it doesn't matter where the food comes from, if it works, use it! Yay!  I can not say enough good things about Nobuo at Teeter House. I hope I am lucky enough to someday own a restaurant like this.  Thank you! Thank you!
