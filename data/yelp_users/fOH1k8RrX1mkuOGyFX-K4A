Nothing very special. Basic menu. Decent food. Over priced. No kids menu. The waitress was polite. Me and my family wouldn't be back. I also wouldn't recommend it. I am easy to please too. Just didn't do it for me. I had the pastrami sandwich. My wife had a Philly cheesesteak. She thought it was pretty good. But still over priced.

This is the spot! A mom and pop shop in the down town Mesa area. Haven burger and Lenny's are the 2 best burger spots in Mesa. Although they are different. Haven burger is also less expensive. It is actually very affordable and you get your money's worth. It is a must eat spot.

A co worked and I went here for lunch. I have been back about once a week to get the Gyro. I also have my wife hooked. The sandwiches/gyro are great for the price! Nothing flashy or fancy. Just a good place to pick up the best gyro I have ever had. Same 2 people have been there working since I have been going. They are friendly and welcoming once they recognize you. I would highly recommend picking up a GYRO here! Enjoy!
