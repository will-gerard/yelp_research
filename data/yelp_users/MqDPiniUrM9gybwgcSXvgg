DON'T LET THE EXTERIOR (OR INTERIOR FOR THAT MATTER) FOOL YOU!!!!!! Amazing food! Best I have had north of the border. Their Sopes, amazing! tacos great! Service has always been exceptional! The little treat shop next to the main restaurant has the most delicious flan!

Three strikes you're out. So I have been to Santan 3 times to try to eat and each time didn't make it passed my drinks. Why you may ask? Service is HORRIBLE!  Being in the service industry I can tell when places are busy and when servers are just down right awful. 2 of the times I was in I waited for my beer while servers sat and chatted, so headless beers I received. This to me alone wouldn't make me stand up and leave. The next thing always follows and I don't know why. The server happens to take every other tables order except ours. (tables that got  there after us mind you) I though hmmm, maybe because I am holding the menu, so I put it down ,nothing. Maybe because its open, I close it, nothing. All this while people get there fresh brews delivered with beautiful foamy heads. The best thing about it was the sunspot was a good beer, a killer headache after one, but a great beer none the less So unfortunately I will never recommend this place again, save your time and  take the extra 15 minute drive over to four peaks.

Horrible service, drove from chandler because we heard this was the best. Picked up our to go order and NO noodles in the chow mein. We called and the said they would deliver the noodle after we told them were we lived they said its too far they are too busy to deal with it and we get a 3 dollar credit. The dish was around 8 dollars and the reason to get chow mein is the noodles. After spending time on the phone the lady said the noodles aren't even that good and "customer don't like" why are they on your menu then?  The way they deal with customers is horrible save your coin.

Great food, Great service, Can't ask for more!  Don't let the area and the decor stop you! Kick back, have and amazing margarita, and enjoy a night out! This is the first place I can honestly tell you that, I don't know if there was a T.V. in the restaurant because, I was so focused on the fun, atmosphere and food!

Great staff, knowledgable, takes time to discuss your treatments. I felt a ton better by just the first couple visits! Definitely worth going! They do a great consultation and really explain the treatment best suited for you!

First off the food is amazing. I wish you could break the reviews for food, and service, into different ratings but...  Service was atrocious...horrible.. down right nonexistent. First off I am in the industry so I am very very easy going when it comes to service.   Sunday night, not busy. We got sat, waited for the drink order to be taken. No less then 15-20 minutes a server comes up. The same guy who sat us! (Jeremy) So I know that he knew we exactly were there.  No apologies, no personality.  So we shake it off put all orders in food, drinks, tell him how we have to split the check.   15 minutes later (that is being generous) he brings my bottled ice tea... no other drinks though. Hmm odd but maybe the bar w/2 people at it is slammed.  20 MINUTES LATER after food starts arriving, and after my friend asked the waiter, the rest of the party gets their wines (that was only 2 people, not a huge party).   So the food comes out right (because there was a food runner) we were missing only one side of rice we ordered. Which was no biggie. Food was amazing, can't say enough good about it!   We finish and the server never even came back to see how the food was. After he came back, still no apologies, no clue, it took about 30-40 minutes to figure how to split our check. This was after he brought me the not split check and with the rice they forgot to bring us.    We wanted to eat more, but did not want to be there another hour. Sadly the server completely ruined it for us.
