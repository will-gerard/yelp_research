I think that the food here is wonderful. The atmosphere is unique with a constant buzzing near the front room, lots of action. Maybe the menu is too ambitious and the log jam gets long, however this gives it character and many people like that. Noli is a fine waiter and the service there is as good as possible and usually warm.

Pizza is my favorite in the valley. Salads are sublime. The sauce is homemade even for the pizza. Even when the service isn't the best it always has character. Some of the negative reviews I have read are absolute bunk. Even people who like it seem to like having some negative comment, like they don't want to cater to penny pinchers and frauds..and the parking sucks!   Let's have pizza

I have been meaning to drop a 5 star on this place for a long time but I am a Phoenecian and I have other things to do. I love this place! The different styles of pizza, the Good wine list the specials and of course Jackie. I am kicking myself right now because I did not go by and pick up a pizza yesterday.

This is the favorite of my family and friends for eating economically. These people are working long hours to bring some great etnic cuisine to a not so great neighborhood. Thanks Sinbad and the Samoon and Kobbos are the greatest.

I am in total agreement with Victoria. They do not stand behind their mediocre products and are not seasoned compassionate caregivers. Don't trust thc readings. They are very misleading and at times there is fraud.

I renewed my certificate here last week. The service was excellent and the doctors were far less intrusive and inquisitive than the doctors who renewed me the last two years. Oddly enough those annoying doctors were the same ones I saw before. This issue of paperwork gone askew....Well I will see what happens with my own. If you have your own medical records that you are willing to use you may be able to get certified for less money, however you must ask yourself what is the value of your time and do you really trust your doctor and insurance company.???

If only $ was no object. The buds here are rivaled only by HWC and they have more issues than price. If you can afford the best, this is the place. If you are like me and cannot afford the best, treat yourself to here on occasion. They are also very nice and service is fast. Wish it was deli-style, wish they all were!

Because the service is consistently excellent. These people are as nice as you will find and when you see them in 3 months they are still nice. Considering the quality of their flowers...If it says sf (Swell farm) it is their own and might be great. If you see the same strains as you saw at the other dispensary...Welcome to Maricopa County. They get the 5 for service, occasional excellence and the best prices I know of,

This is the most elegant Chinese restaurant that I know of in the Valley. The last location by Scottsdale Road was also nice and cosmopolitan, once inside. The food is always good and sometimes a special is GREAT. The ambience makes you want to have wine. They have it! I want to have that Peking Duck. I have dined at Jade Palace multiple times and enjoy all the locations, however this one is my favorite.
