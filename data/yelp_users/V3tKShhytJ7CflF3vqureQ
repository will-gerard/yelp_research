Do you remember how Pancho's used to taste? Keep that memory and don't go again.

If you want some awesome food at a reasonable price this is it! I had a Christmas party for future clients and was impressed with everything. We had the slow roasted brisket with potatoes and vegetables. Great meal!  My future clients kept raving on how good it was. It was on time and hot and simply delicious. I look forward to doing more business with these guys in the future.

This is my new favorite small restaurant for Mexican food! I have been here 3 times and liked everything I ordered. The chile relleno burrito is great. The Arizona burrito is really a treat with the added pieces of bacon inside the burrito with potato and meat. I went last Friday for a business lunch and had the tacos. They are to die for! Ok!  fellow gringo's don't forget to ask for some limes to squeeze on top of your food. It will really give your food that bam!

Thank you so much for the good reviews. I went here for a business meeting 8-13-2010. I ate soo much I hurt myself. Everything was great I especially loved the lamb and chicken curry. The staff was excellent and very kind. I will recommend my new favorite Indian food restaurant to everyone. ;)

I refuse to eat here again. A piece of plastic from the bag containing the raw beans was in my cooked bean burrito. They have raised prices again at this location, They did make me another burrito, but i don't want to eat at a place that doesn't care about what they serve the customer.

The prices are high the food is ok. I had a sandwich a bag of chips and a glass of tea total was $12.33. It was way too pricey for a lunch.

Do not eat the chicken. I went with 5 people around 1:00 P.M. I had a po boy sandwich it was lukewarm and not very good. Corporate needs to get in here before this grand opening becomes a grand closing. Stay safe with the red beans and rice.
