Stopped in for lunch on a Sunday after running around the Children's Museum for a few hours.  I usually frequent the Fullerton, CA location which is always a 30 minute-1.5 hour wait for dinner so was really excited when they took our party of 2+2 kids in less than 5 minutes.    Our waiter was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed - especially the kids.  Luckily, they were on their best behavior even though they were exhausted.  I think the staff was appreciative that they were mostly clean and quiet.  We ordered the ravioli, spaghetti with Italian sausage and 2 kid's macaroni and cheeses.  I love that their meals are served "complete" with a salad, bread, and ice cream or spumoni.  Even the kids got milk, applesauce, and dessert as well.    The kids loved the train, and the staff encouraged us to explore and ring the bell.  We quietly tip-toed through the car (between other eating patrons) to the front and rang the bell while both were over the moon with excitement.    Tasty lunch with great customer service - thanks OSF Phoenix!

Finally reviewing after our second visit to the Arena (the first time it was Jobing.com and the Coyotes were from "Phoenix").  Warning... It's a long one...  The first visit was awesome.  Boyfriend drove from LA and I drove down from Flagstaff.  We got there early, got FREE PARKING, and had a great dinner at Margaritaville.  Sure, the Kings lost and we had overpriced, terrible seats, but it was still a good experience.  An experience that was on the bucket list before I moved back to So Cal.    The second visit was meh.  Boyfriend, his sister, and I decided at noon that we were going to pull a turn-around for the Kings/Coyotes game and we hopped in a rental car and drove out.  The trip was easy-going and we got to Glendale in record time.  Then, we hit the parking nightmare.  No longer was the parking free.  We got stuck in crazy lot traffic, circled and sat for over 20 minutes, and paid $20.  All this while numerous lots were strategically "closed." (Here's to supply and demand...)  We missed the start of the game but were able to catch a majority of the first period.    On first intermission, we went to grab some food.  Not wanting to get too far from our seats, and miss any more of the game, we got in line for some hot dogs and nachos.  Well, they ran out of hot dogs.  How does an arena run out of hot dogs less than 20 minutes into the game?  We thought maybe it was just the concession stand we were at but, no, it was every concession stand.  We ended up with some carnitas nachos and some carne asada nachos that were not great at all.  A little later in the game, I saw someone with poutine from Smoke's Poutinerie!  If I would have known that was an option, I would have traversed the different levels to find it.  We did get some Timmy Hos, however.  I love having the option for Canadian eateries.    Price-wise on Stub Hub, our tickets were comparable to Kings games at Staples Center which is odd with the amount of tickets that are available up until game time.  We usually like to sit in the higher levels to see the entire rink and we can afford more games that way.  Comparing to Staples, the upper levels are much steeper, the scoreboard is a bit dated, as well as the tvs in the claustrophobic concourse, and the arena is much emptier.  However, most of the fans you meet at the game are congenial and know their team.  The poor Coyotes get a bad rap for being a desert team without much wide-spread support.  One neat aspect of the arena are the standing tabletops above the seats on the upper levels.  You literally can stand and watch the game while eating your food or waiting for a stoppage of play, not a luxury we get from the enclosed  arena at Staples.  The Westgate area that surrounds the arena is neat, with many options to grab some grub or drinks before the game, or just kill some time.  We even got a free sample of a whole loaf of bread when walking out of the game.  Great for our late trip back home.    Also, we still laugh about that silly Sandstorm dance.  Thanks for the memories.  So, long story short... Learn from our mistakes.   - Get there early for free parking. - Grab something to eat before you go in (they may run out of hot dogs!) - Buy tickets closer to game start on Stub Hub, you will probably get a better deal.

Nothing short of amazing.    We made reservations for Mon Ami Gabi for our bachelorette party of 11 this weekend.  Unfortunately, we were running late so had to change our reservation from 6 to 6:45.  When we arrived, the line was quite long, so it took about 10 minutes to get to the hostess desk.  As soon as we got to the front, however, they took us right back to our table.  The dining room is a bit crowded, but beautiful.  The ambiance is still romantic.  As we perused the menu, our waitress (Shana) noticed that we were a little rushed.  Our limo was scheduled to pick us up for the next event at 8PM (it was 7:15 by this time).  She took our orders and said she would have the kitchen rush so that we could be out in time.  We were absolutely amazed when we got our food a few minutes later.  There was quite a bit of diversity in the orders - steak, chicken, pasta, etc. and everything was cooked perfectly still.  Every girl raved about their dish, and the quality.  Special thank you to the kitchen staff.  Shana and her assistants kept our drinks full and went above and beyond to make sure that we had a wonderful experience, even though rushed.  She was able to split our checks 9 ways and we made it in time to meet our driver outside at 8PM.    The french bread was served in a cute paper bag, with butter, and this flavorful carrot garnish.  I opted for the chicken grand-mere which came with pommes puree.  Again, cooked perfectly with the perfect complement of flavors and spices.  Usually, a French restaurant is not my first choice when dining in Vegas, but I'm sure I will be back to sit and enjoy the complete meal and experience.

My sister's in-laws are from Wisconsin so whenever we are in Phoenix we have to stop at Culver's and take a picture of the nephew to send to the midwest.  Surprisingly, for a fast-food burger joint, the food is pretty good.  I've had the grilled chicken sandwich, cheese curds, sweet potato fries, onion rings, chicken strips and frozen custard (not all at once, mind you ;) ).  The cheese curds are pretty greasy so difficult to eat too many.  The chicken sandwich was cooked well, moist and on a fresh bun.  The fries and onion rings are quality as well.  But the custard... oh my... super tasty.  Rich, but creamy and worth every bite and calorie.    This location is clean and the service is quick.  Don't forget to get the custard!

So, I haven't been to many children's museums since I don't have kids, but Children's Museum of Phoenix is the best children's museum I have ever been to.    I was visiting my Godkids (age 2 and 3) for the weekend and the eldest wanted to take me to the "choorens moosum."  Their family has a membership and it is a frequent respite from the outdoor play during that blazing Phoenix summer.  They loved running around and showing me all their favorite rooms and exhibits.  We made macaroni and cheese in the kitchen, ran through the noodle forest, raced cars, and "got our hair wet" laying down in the flying bathtub.    I believe the general admission cost is $11, with several different options for memberships depending on how many people you would like to include (from 1 to a family of 8).   Located in an old elementary school, the Children's Museum is very clean and modern.  There are several different rooms on 3 different levels - including a mock kitchen, grocery store, race cars, tricycles, noodle forest, huge climbing gym complete with flying bathtub and more.  It is a great way for young ones to burn off energy while being creative with learning.  You can tell that a lot of thought has gone into some of the exhibits that takes into account learning levels and ages.  For example, in the kitchen, children can create their own pizza, complete with baking it in the mock stone oven and serving it to parents sitting at a booth or table.  Our 2 and 3 year old opted to pretend to fill up a pot with water, throw in some different textured fabric strips, stir, and present us with a bowl of said fabric.  However, there were older kids placing their aprons on, creating elaborate pizzas with the same color or texture fabric strips, taking it to the oven to "cook" and then cleaning their plates in the sink after.  It was intriguing to see all the creativity that each child exhibited differently.  There are several workers around watching, to make sure rules are followed (no purses or bags on the climbing gym), cleaning up forgotten toys, as well as making sure that all of the items that are supposed to stay in a room, stay.  Although, don't forget to watch your own little ones - it can get a bit busy and chaotic.  I would definitely consider a membership if I had kids and lived in the area.  Even a few hours every few weeks would be worth it!
