Its a very small restaurant hiding behind Taco Bell and I probably would've never gone in if it wasn't for the high ratings on yelp. The restaurant felt like a little old cottage.The service was good and i think because they don't have too many customers, they make sure to do an extra good job on preparing the entrees. Thats it about the unimportant details,now on to the most important part. The food tasted amazing and we will for sure go back to try their other entr√©es we didn't try today. I will definitely recommend this place.

I went here with my husband on a date night!! Everything about this restaurant was amazing. The place is decorated very nicely and has a modern touch to it. The food was very flavorful, it literally makes you fall in love with it by firing all your tastebuds. t's a little on the expensive side but it's well worth the price. Compared to other high end restaurants the portions here are pretty big.  The ambiance was very romantic with candle lights and all, I would definitely recommend this place for a romantic date.  The only aspect that was a little lacking was probably the service, but the food was so great that I was happy they weren't bothering me too much.

Such a nice little restaurant at Talking Stick Resort, I cant believe I hadn't tried this place sooner.  We went there around 9pm and had to wait 20-30 minutes to get seated. The portions are huge and even though the food was amazing we couldn't finish it and had to take almost half of our entree to go! Overall, I had a great experience!! The seafood was delicious, the service was great and the prices were normal!! If you are looking for a good seafood, this is the place to go!!

I paid $1000 to get treated for a year and a half, which equals to about 14 sessions. I have one last treatment to do but I am so unsatisfied with the results that I know I have to go somewhere else once I am done with this place because I have the same exact hair growth I did before I started. I don't know what type of laser they use that gives such bad results. On top of that, they are pretty rude. A couple of times they gave me an evening appointment and the building door was closed once I got there. After calling them 3 times, the tech came down and opened the door. I was expecting for her to apologize but she acted like it was my fault. Anyways save yourself time and money and don't go to this place. They are expensive, don't know what they are doing,  they rush through every session and use broken lasers that doesn't even work!

Nicely done!! Finally found a salon in this area that does a decent mani pedi!! The staff is very friendly and everything's very clean! Its maybe a few dollars more expensive than some of the other salons in that area but its definitely worth it!!

Not the best Indian food that I have had but pretty good for Arizona!! I would recommend the dish with black pepper and shrimp (don't remember the exact name).
