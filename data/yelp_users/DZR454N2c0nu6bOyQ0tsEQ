They promised they would have my car fixed in under 30 days from massive hail damage.  Instead, they had it for 45 days.  I had to pay for two weeks of car rental out of pocket because they took so long, then it wasn't fixed right, and I finally had to have my insurance agent step in to force them to do the job right.  Very unprofessional, and I will never bring them my business again.

When it comes to traditional Ethiopian fare, this joint can't be beat in the valley.  My favs?  The Shorba Soup (a vegetarian take on the traditional Shorba) and the Misir Wat (a spiced red lentil dish).  And while it's not Ethiopian, the Tiramasu is a must-have!

Ok, so there is no place in the valley I would go for a hot dog OTHER than Dazzo's.  They've been making the best dogs in town for decades.    That said, their pricing is a bit higher than it should be, they STILL won't take credit/debit cards (by far my biggest complaint), and the best way to enjoy the food is through the drive through, because your car will be more comfortable than the sitting areas they provide.  Nevertheless, I give them 4 starts because the food is about as good as a dog can get!

Ok ... I have to admit, first, that I have been a HUGE fan of In N Out burger for years ... then I stopped into Freddy's one day, and haven't gone to In N Out since!  The service is great, the food is AMAZINGLY good, and the atmosphere is fun and fresh.  You will not be disappointed!  I do the California Double Combo ... give them a try!

The staff at Koi are a delight -- they each have a unique personality that they don't shy from expressing, and after a few visits, you'll feel like your dining with friends, not staff.  The sushi is top-grade, in my opinion.  I've lived in the Phoenix valley for 35+ years, and tried more sushi houses than I care to count, and the variety, quality, and price of Koi is first class.  Visit today!  If you see me there, say hello!

Can I give this place more than 5 stars? I would if I could ... you won't find better pizza anywhere in the vicinity, and the staff are very friendly.  But don't stop with the pizza!  The pasta dishes are amazing too!

When it comes to sandwiches, Which Wich has it down!  They may not be the largest sandwiches, but there are times with quality wins out over quantity, and this is one of those times!  The variety available to you beats out any other sandwich shop in town (INCLUDING subway and the like), and you will find yourself having unexpected cravings for these sandwiches once you've tried your first.  The music is a bit too loud most of the time, but the service is friendly and fast, and the hard-to-find crushed ice is a must since it is so rare these days (lets face it, what QT calls crushed ISN'T!).  If you're not sure, go to the website, and join the club ... they send you an email for a free sandwich.  What better way to try them out, than with a free sandwich, right?

I could have been okay with the small selection of flavor choices.  I can even overlook that it is overpriced, compared with other competitors.  But when the only person working can't stop video chatting on her cell phone to greet us? When it was time to pay,she told her phone to hold on.  Rang us up, then went right back to her cell phone video chat.  Talk about unacceptable service!
