I went here on a date and it was a great atmosphere for people who aren't stuffy.  Except the heating on the patio -- Geeze! Turn the heaters down people, this is Phoenix. We did request the heater be turned down, much to the delight of the other tables near us but then a random server came around and turned them back on. This was my only complaint for the evening.  The service was attentive but a little slow - considering how packed they were it was more than reasonable. I ordered the pretzels which were good and my date had a burger and fries, which he said were pretty good too and pretty standard fare for the place.  If you can avoid driving here, do so. The parking situation is the absolute worst.

Normally I don't have a bad thing to say about Four Peaks (aside from the parking) but after spending over $80 on Mother's Day brunch for low-quality food, I'm very disappointed. We went in for the special menu and found the buffet to LOOK very nice but to fall short of an actual delivery. For $32 per person, we got Eggs Benedict, whose English muffin couldn't be cut with a standard knife (trust me, I tried, and I worked at it so hard I almost knocked the table over), undercooked but okay prime rib (should have had an option for cuts that were cooked more and less fatty - looked like a quality starter cut to begin with). The bacon and sausage tasted bulk-made and the waffles came with a Knotts Breakfast Syrup to-go packet. The salmon enchiladas were the only saving grace on the buffet spread; even the turkey pot pie raised eyebrows since it didn't even have a pie crust?  Not the worst breakfast I've ever had, but for $32? I could have gone to Caffe Boa or Golden Corral (seriously, that disappointed with Four Peaks) or somewhere with much better food for cheaper! Now, if there were the option to choose something other than the "Mother's Day Brunch" for 32 bucks a pop, then I could at least say this was my fault, but we were told that was the only option (though later, before 2pm when brunch was supposed to end, I saw "regular" food on other tables).   The mimosas were okay, but small and difficult to mess up anyway.  The highlight of breakfast was the baked goods - From Chompies. Sorely disappointed in Four Peaks' Brunch. I will definitely be back for beer and bar food, but steer clear of this place for special occasions or buffet brunches. I wish I had anticipated this but I never expect bad things from Four Peaks.

I'm new to Bikram, so forgive me if this is a biased review, but I really don't think that people reviewing this studio understand what Bikram is about. LOCK YOUR KNEE.  Bikram is a torture chamber in high heat and high humidity. No talking. Lock your knee. You have no knee. (They're getting in my brain).  That's the point. It's not "hot yoga" where you're doing yoga poses with the instructor and everything is flow-y and nice and happy and sweet. It's hard. You have to focus on your own postures and poses and listening to the words and following to get the right form. LOCK YOUR KNEE.  All that being said, I have been going for a week. Tonight will be my sixth class. I'm signing up for more. Because I like to be tortured. Because the staff/instructors at this studio are friendly, helpful, and they know my name (THEY KNOW MY NAME and I've only been going for one week!). LOCK YOUR KNEE.  The practice room itself, to me, had a funky smell on my first day. I got used to it. Despite the heat and humidity, you can feel the air moving in the room and it's not stuffy. It's easy to breathe. The heat becomes comfortable. The instructors do come around and help with form (they've all spent some time with me!) LOCK YOUR KNEE.  The studio offers $2 rentals for towels and mats, but I think that's gross even though they clean them so I bring my own. I just don't want to share sweat with someone else, no matter how clean the mat or towels might be. LOCK YOUR KNEE. This is good for someone who wants to try Bikram out without committing to buying a mat or yoga towel (I just use regular bath towels). They also have a really nice change room, separate recycling and trash containers, Smart Water and Vita Coco for sale, and I got a "I Survived My First Bikram Class" pin when I survived my first class. LOCK YOUR KNEE.  All in all, I loved this place, I love Bikram, and I love it so much that I'm actually redoing my budget to afford this (it IS expensive, but I realized if I quit drinking so many beers and so much coffee, I can afford it AND I'll be healthier in general).   Last chance everyone, LOCK YOUR KNEE. And get over to BYT.

We dined at Q for restaurant week on Saturday and really enjoyed our experience. I had never had a fine dining experience beforehand, but this place showed me just how enjoyable such an evening can be.  Our server, Trisha, was great. She knew the wine list well and made excellent recommendations. Although we didn't like the first two wines she brought us, she found a gem for the final try and we were impressed with her knowledge and fluidity in handling our preferences.  The service was prompt without being overly fast, we had time to enjoy conversation and the courses we ate. I had the Dungeness crab-cucumber salad for the first course and the salmon for the second, and both were great. The onions on the salad could have been more flavorful, especially for being freshly shaved, but otherwise, I had no complaints about the salad. The entire salmon dish was incredible; I had never had huckleberries or lobster mushrooms and the pairing on the plate was great. The plating itself was beautiful and well thought out and really complimented the meal.  My friend had the salted cod on bread with pickles for her first course (she said it was great, I thought it was too salty but that's why I didn't order "salted" anything). For her second course, she chose the beef wellington which was simultaneously incredible and a bit of a let down. The meat itself was tender and flavorful, but the crust was too flaky and bland. It did not complement the meat well.  Our final course was the flourless chocolate torte with strawberry-something on top. The torte itself was delicious and the plating was gorgeous, but the strawberry-something was forgettable at best and poorly textured at worse.   I forgot about the bread! The first thing we got was two different kinds of bread with a very good green butter of some sort (I had a half a bottle of wine so I don't exactly remember every detail!)   Ultimately, the food was incredible and  the service experience was more than enough to make me look forward to coming back for the Farmers Feast and wine pairings. I would have liked it if the food presentations were a little bit louder (it was hard to hear most of the people who brought us food except for a tall young man and our server) but otherwise I have no complaints. Trisha took great care of us, making sure we were happy and satisfied and was pleasant but unobtrusive.

I'm very disappointed in my latest CPK trip. I had the asparagus and arugula salad, pesto cream penne with chicken, and a diet pepsi. This came to $22.13, but my card was charged for $31.42. Okay these things happen. The manager said he adjusted the charge but it's not showing adjusted today. The pasta was lacking in flavor and the $3 upcharge for what looked like less than an ounce of chicken was absolutely not worth it. The salad was good, the service was prompt, but the value and quality of the food? Huge letdown.

I'll admit I was surprised when the aesthetician requested I flip over on my belly and hold a cheek, but she asked it so nicely and matter of fact-ly, that I felt no need to argue. I was nervous about my first Brazilian but after going to Glow, not only do I know that I will keep getting them, I know I will only be going to Glow for this service.  Unfortunately, I can't remember the aesthetician's name now (it was several weeks ago that I went, and I'm due back shortly) but her manner and kindness put me at ease about the whole waxing process. There's something to be said for a woman who can put another at ease about putting hot wax on her bits and then ripping the hair off using said hot wax - but this woman was not only able to calm my fears but also kept me chatting in a way that helped distract me enough to look forward to the end result without stressing too much over the process.  I ended up getting a "modified" Brazilian and was charged accordingly - not full price since I didn't get a full Brazilian. I appreciated that despite the fact that she put in so much work and time (30 minutes!! - I'm used to going in, getting the skin, hair, and wax ripped off and being off the waxing table in under 20!), she only charged me for a partial Brazilian. Many salons wouldn't modify the price according to the customer's needs, only their own.   Waxing is very Machiavellian - the end has to justify the means because otherwise it can make for walking funny, in grown hairs, and embarrassment, not to mention pain. The Nufree wax is gentle enough, although I had a surprising reaction to it, I think that was more me than the product (since I've had it used on me before with no problems). The aesthetician also provided me with a small sample of lotion to help with in-grown hairs and any irritation that would arise. I was incredibly impressed with her thoroughness as well as her kindness.  I'm looking forward to going back to Glow, despite the masochism of getting waxed!

We went last night for Mom's birthday and had a good dinner. I was pleased with the service from the waiter who another reviewer referred to as a jerk - we sat just outside the bar area, had prompt service, were provided silverware without asking for it, had the specials explained to us. He went so far as to help us get a little extra food for free with the special and upgraded my mom's marg for her birthday.  The marg itself was good and the place has a good selection of local beers all on Happy Hour.  The food was good, love the rice and the beans - nothing dry or overcooked here. The chips came out fresh and crisp and warm. The only complaint I had was that my "empanada" came out in a folded over tortilla and not as a dumpling of sorts, which was really disappointing. I like the breadiness of an empanada - if I wanted a tortilla dish I would have ordered a quesadilla or another taco. The filling was good though and I enjoyed the salsa and the pico de gallo that came with the chips.  We were a little disappointed that the salsa bar is only available Tuesdays and Sundays, but we'll just have to come back. My dad swears by the habanero hot sauce.

This fast-food Americanized Chinese cuisine wants to be as good as Panda Express. And I'm saying that knowing full well that Panda Express isn't that great either. The convenience factor (buying a quick to-go meal in the grocery store) is the biggest draw of this establishment.  Cafeteria-style serving, the food is generally not very hot, the portions are small for an extremely high price ($8+ for a 3-item entree consists of a small scoop of each of your entrees and not that much rice, either), and the staff is often rude. If you question the portion size, they'll add a little more and say something in another language to whoever's in the back that usually elicits laughter. I don't mind people communicating in their preferred language, but the timing and the laughter makes me uncomfortable.  I used to be a big fan of this place, until the pricing went up and the portions went down - along with the service. They charge extra for shrimp or BBQ pork ($1.50 upcharge why? - the items aren't that special). The worst part was that the next day the leftovers made me incredibly sick (after being stored in the fridge and reheated properly) which did not happen on previous trips.   Skip Rice Garden even if you're in Bashas' and hungry - there's a few other places in the strip mall and a freezer section in the grocery store. They're not open very late, the food is likely to not be hot enough anyway, and the price does not reflect the quality.

I've been very skeptical of dentist's office ever since I was a kid and the dental hygienist allowed me to use the water-sucker-thingy on my brother mid-treatment. Needless to say, I was going hogwild torturing him by sucking his gums and lips into the device and she didn't bat an eye.   Healthy Smiles is the exact opposite of dental torture. I've had the pleasure of seeing both Dr Manning and Dr Rauch and am impressed by both of their senses of humor, levels of patient care, and stress-free, no pressure delivery of information. This dentist's office actually doesn't upsell you! Everyone in the office is kind, honest, and knows me (and it seems the rest of their patients) by name.  When they moved from an office in Mesa proper to Chandler, I was thrilled but if they had moved across the valley to Glendale, I would have followed them there, too.   Robin, the office manager, has an excellent eye for detail and will help you find ways to get the most bang from your insurance buck. They also have an excellent referral reward system and a great new patient package - including free whitening trays (if they're still offering that). MJ is the hygienist I normally see, and I would have to say she is without a doubt, one of the most gentle and caring practitioners I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.  I actually look forward to going to the dentist thanks to these folks.
