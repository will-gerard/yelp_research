This museum participates in the Bank of America Museums on Us program. On select weekends, Bank of America customers get free admission to the museum. I was delightfully surprised the last time I dropped by and admission ended up free for me and my boyfriend.    Info at: http://museums.bankofamerica.com/  On a more relevant note, this museum is awesome. Really great contemporary art collection. This museum has a photograph by Vic Muniz, from his project he did in collaboration with workers at one of the world's largest landfills in Brazil. This project was the topic of  Wasteland, an AMAZING documentary that was nominated for an Oscar. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the photograph at the PAM after watching the documentary. Good times.  PS: The cafe on site is not very good. They don't even have an espresso machine. If need be, I would recommend getting coffee beforehand or afterwards.

Damn this theater is beautiful. It is so incredibly ornate, even the lobby area. While I was in line to get drinks (expensive but expected), I couldn't help but just stare in awe up and down the walls and ceiling. EVERYTHING is worth a look inside of this theater.   The theater area itself is gorgeous, and looks like something out of an old-timey movie. It makes for a very dramatic stage.  I love that this is a small-ish theater so any seat is a good seat. We were in the balcony area and got a great view of the performance. The balcony seating has restricted leg room, so tall dudes (and ladies) beware.  I hope I get another chance to visit this beautiful theater soon.

So after a brief visit to Scottsdale, tired of seeing nothing but strip malls, I wanted some coffee. Stat. Wanting to do the local thing instead of giving in to the all-mighty Starbucks, a quick Yelp search pointed me towards Coffee Bean. This was not my first choice, as the other places were closing at or around 6pm (WTF Scottsdale?!?).  So first of all, this place is a chain. So there goes my "shop local" thing. My bad, not theirs.  And, second, this place sucks. Sorry but it does. My chai latte was pale and very close to the hue of milk. In fact, it tasted like milk. Watery and iced milk. Yuck. And the cappuccino was BAD. Yes, BAD. The espresso was way too hot. Temperature plays a very big part of pulling a good shot of espresso, among many other variables. The milk was alright. The espresso to milk ratio was way off as well.   The atmosphere is boring and generic. Any Starbucks interior is leagues better; more comfy, more appealing, etc.   One of the few instances when going with Starbucks would have been a better option. I have no idea how this place has a four star rating. Geez.

I drove from Tucson to find the two places I wanted to visit closed (next time, I'll really do my research) and ended up at Lux to drown my frustrations in caffeine. This place did not disappoint. My latte macchiato was delicious. The coffee was perfectly balanced by the milk; all-in-all, a great drink.   Good atmosphere and friendly baristas, too. I appreciated the kind suggestions from the girl at the counter. Will definitely return the next time I'm in Phoenix.

Went here for dinner after a long conference day and was super impressed. I love their plates and drinking glasses made of pewter. They are gorgeous!   However, what impressed me most was their food, obviously. The korma sauce is the best I have had hands down. Take that other Indian restaurants!  It has a delicious nutty flavor and very rich. I had the lamb korma and left the Dhaba a very happy camper.  A Yelp check-in gets you free dessert. Score!

Well I've only been here once, but that's only because I live in Tucson. I still think about their chilaquiles a month after having had them for the first time. Must be love!  All you have to know 1) Chilaquiles: the most basic of Mexican breakfast food. The presentation at Gallo Blanco sexes up the dish by a whole lot.  Whole tortillas used instead of the usual strips/bits. Alternating layers of tortilla, salsa, veggies, and egg. A minor work of art.   2) Chilaquiles at Gallo Blanco are not only good looking but delicious as well. I ate EVERYTHING on my plate.  3) Hipsters like chilaquiles. They were EVERYWHERE.   In summary: Basic. Sexy.  Delicious. Hipsters. Got it?

I loove Rudy's. It is a staple food item in my South Texas town. I was so happy to find out there was a Rudy's in AZ. It's also super close to IKEA (5 min drive), which is the reason I go to PHX 95% of the time.   The quality is just as good as the Texan counterpart. The lean brisket is flavorful and the chicken is juicy. You almost don't need the sauce but it's so delicious so why not?! My favorite: a 1:1 mixture of both of their sauces. Trust.   All food orders are given with all you can eat white bread. You can also request wheat, for the bbq amateurs out there. White bread is part of the experience people!  Highly recommend this little piece of Texas in Arizona.
