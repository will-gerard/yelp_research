I love coming here to get my nails done. I have been all over town and Kelly's is by far the best in quality and price. Everyone in the shop is super friendly and smiling, they all speak English and don't talk behind your back which can be common in nail salons. The salon is super clean, I've never had a bad experience with manicures or pedicures. They are really awesome at designs too!!! I will continue to come here and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for "the place" to go.

I went in to Sallys to look at clip in hair extensions. This isn't my first trip into this store and have been in for a variety of things. This particular visit I walked in and was the only customer in the store. I was greeted with a quick "hi" by the two ladies chatting at the counter. I walked straight to the hair extensions to see the different brands and color match. While I was looking both store clerks continued to talk about babies and pay no mind to me. Since I had never looked at the extensions before I was feeling kind of lost. I stood looking at the extensions for 10 minutes comparing my hair to the different colors, still no help. Finally after accidentally opening one of the packages ( the clasp broke while I was looking at it) and feeling the hair one of the clerks came over and asked if I needed any help in a little annoyed voice. I said no and proceeded to stare at the aisle. I decided I would have a better time looking online for cheaper prices and walked around the rest of the store. There were 2 random carts in the aisle empty just sitting there. I picked out a nail polish and checked out and left. It's just annoying, and these people want to get paid 15$ an hour to stand and talk about gossip. Please.
