Super amazing food!  We had the green papaya salad, rice crepe, wokked beef, fried rice, crispy rice cake.  The crepe was out of this world!  The rice cake was also delicious.  The staff was so friendly.  We will be back!

Some of my favorites here: white pizza, BLT (with FENNEL!!!) caprese salad, and of course the salt river bar.  I love this place!

Dirty table, bathroom, silverware and plates.  The appetizers came out cold and sloppy.  The potatoes were undercooked.  Not a fan.

The rotisserie chicken was so moist and tender!  The atmosphere is comfortable and upscale.  It was busy but not too loud for a quiet conversation.  Our server was knowledgable about the menu and friendly.  Nothing about this dining experience knocked my socks off, but overall it was really good.

We ordered the sampler platter which was plenty of food for three adults.  For my first Ethiopian experience I was very impressed.  The food was delicious.

Their wood fired pizza is amazing.  Their rustic bread is the thing dreams are made of.  Their prices are a bit steep.

I have to start this review with a disclaimer.  I adore pei wei.  I'm a huge fan and have been for years.  It's our go to take out spot and we order from them often.  However this particular location has really gone down hill.  As we usually order out and rarely eat in I hadn't noticed the decline inside.  Although it's under going renovations the actual upkeep has been greatly neglected.  The cleanliness of the restaurant is horrific.  From the sticky tables, to the poor sweeping, to the grimy door handles, to the hazards in the bathroom.  The women's bathroom has a leaky pipe and water collects below the sink creating a huge tripping hazard.  The soak also drips and there is a large puddle of soap on the floor as well.  My husband and I were horrified when we noticed, walking by what the kitchen looked like.  It had been freshly mopped but not swept.  It was disgusting.  The outdoor seating area was terribly maintained.  The tables were more like see-saws and the ground was filthy.  The silverware wasn't restocked and when we informed the server he told us he would look in to it, when our food came or we mentioned it again and his response was, "there are forks now."  He didn't even offer to bring us one.  The food was an absolute joke.  It was so poorly put together and rushed.  It looked like my 5 year old daughter did the chopping.    My husband ordered a teriyaki bowl and the amount of white onion in the bowl was shocking.  There was more raw white onion than rice, and maybe 7 pieces of chicken.  The edemame was overlooked and soggy and served with pieces of soggy noodle stuck to the shells.  I ordered caramel beef because I adore the Asian slaw.  My dish not only came out with the wrong protein but it didn't resemble the dish I ordered in the least.  Some large horribly cut pieces of red pepper and carrots were thrown on top of a bed of super dry noodles and chicken.  I found one piece of pineapple.  The manager listened to our concerns and remade our dishes.  She handled the situation well.  My dish was much better made but still lacking in finesse.  There needs to be more attention to detail and cleanliness.  The dishes need to be checked with quality control.

Definitely one of my favorite favorites, and worth the 45 minute drive.  Their pizzas are incredible, I love their sourdough crust.  The dessert choices are dynamite!  Be prepared for a busy busy restaurant and lame parking options.

Love the ambiance of this place.  Super casual.  Consistently good food.  I love the asian chicken salad and the fried green beans.  The breakfast tacos are great too.

I had an appointment downtown and stopped in at this little eatery for their daily lunch special.  Their pasta was delicious and their focaccia bread was dense and full of Rosemary flavor.  All in all it was a nice and fast lunch option if you're in the area.

I want to LOVE this place.  After all it has huge sentimental value for me, as it's where my husband took me on our first date.  Their cold salsa is amazing and their chips are good, which is the only redeeming food item on the menu.  This last time I went I wasn't starving so I ordered an appetizer.  The description of their ahi tacos actually says "sushi cut ahi". What I got instead of thin buttery slices was chunky chewy mouthfuls of horribly cut ahi.  It was disgusting.  To make. matters worse the manager argued with me about it when I pointed it out.  Sadly, memories or not I doubt we will ever be back.  As you can see by the attached photo the chunks were nearly the size of a half dollar and very thick.  I wouldn't even eat a piece of steak that big.  They absolutely overwhelmed the tiny taco shells.  Save your money and eat somewhere else!

Super delicious cheesesteaks.  The location is clean and tastefully decorated.  The bread was awesome.  Their fries are dynamite (malt vinegar and fry sauce are the way to my heart). We ordered a mini cheesesteak for our daughter and for free they upgraded her to a regular sized, great customer service.  We will definitely be back soon!

This isn't the best Thai food I've had but overall it's always impressive and good.  love their masaman curry.  Their green curry is also delicious.  The restaurant itself is clean and well kept.

This is one of my favorite restaurants.  Their  grilled salmon taco is incredible.  I've had their mango chicken salad no less than 50 times.  Their salsas are delicious.

Our first experience here was fantastic!  We will absolutely be back.  We tried the Matador roll and the TNT roll.  The rolls were both equally amazing.  I'll probably be dreaming of the Matador roll.  I'll be back for it soon.  And I'll for sure order the TNT roll again.  My husband, craving his version of comfort food ordered the fried rice.  It was packed full of shrimp and meat.  Our waitress, Taryn was friendly, attentive and helpful.  The restaurant was clean and inviting.  The wait was shorter than expected.  Overall the ambience is right up my alley.  Lively yet intimate with outdoor seating.  I can't wait to go back and I'll definitely be recommending this to my friends.

This place is kind of a dive, pies are just left out on the counter which made me nervous to eat/order them.  I was expecting amazing pie and it was disappointing. The coconut cream was mostly whipped cream with very little filling.  The peanut butter mini pie was better, but nothing amazing.

Why did we wait so long to try this gem?  The food was out of this world.  Try best we've had out in a long time.  The green salsa is divine.  I could drink it.  Our three boys 17, 14, and 10 loved loved loved it.  We tried many empanadas; chicken and veggie, chicken and mushroom, cheeseburger, the two different pork ones, and the jalepeno poppers.  We couldn't pick a favorite. They were all incredible.  We ended with a Nutella/PB empanada with ice cream and a caramel fig.  Both were heavenly.  If you haven't been and are considering it GO!  NOW!

I was surprised by how good our meal was here.  My Thai standards are very high after living in Portland, Or.  We enjoyed the green curry, shrimp fried rice, and lettuce wraps.  Everything was really good.  I generally like things quite spicy and have found that Thai hot is hotter than American hot.  I ordered medium spicy and everything was very spicy.  Keep that in mind as you order.

I have a love hate relationship with this Kneaders.  Their salads and desserts are top knotch.  However their consistency is lacking.  I ordered the same salad 7 weeks in a row and it was made correctly with the correct dressing, ingredients, etc only 1/7 times.

Oh these cupcakes.  Be still my soul.  So yummy.  The cookies are delicious as well.  I find everything in general to be a bit overpriced.  The location is darling, always clean and the staff is friendly.

Our first Ike'a experience was amazing!  I can't wait to go back.  Their menu is pricey but it's worth it.  They offer so many awesome variations of mouth watering sandwiches.

We love this food for a quick weeknight meal .  But this location is poorly managed and sloppily maintained.  Our call in order has been wrong 6/10 times.  The food prep seems sloppy compared to other Rio's we've visited.  And the customer service isn't what it should be.  The staff seems rushed, annoyed and short.

We loved this place.  The salsa is amazing.  The brussel sprout nachos are out of this world!  The skirt steak was well marinated and tender.  The ambiance is amazing.  It's chill and modern.  It's very aesthetically appealing and clean.  Super impressed with our first experience, we will be back!

I was a little overwhelmed by the size of "the yard" when I first walked down the long dark hallway and saw the restaurant in its entirety.  And while, yes it was very loud it was a fun and vibrant atmosphere.  The service was fantastic.  I've found some "hipster" places to also have what I refer to as "rude hipster too cool for school service."  However this was not the case with Culinary Dropout.  Our service was fantastic.  Our server offered great suggestions and checked on us frequently.  We ordered: deviled eggs, balsamic beets and the grilled bread.  The eggs and beets were both fantastic.  The bread had amazing flavor but was too crunchy and tore up my mouth.  My husband had the fried chicken, and although it's not as fabulous as fried chicken in Atlanta, it was delicious.  He loved the honey drizzle and the huge buttery biscuit.  The portion size was just right for a big, filling dinner.  I ordered the Korean steak and it was prepared perfectly and had an explosion of sweet and spicy flavor.  It was fantastic.  I'm so glad I ordered the bread because it definitely needed a carb to soak up the sauce and balance out the sweet heat.    We will be back, with friends soon!  I better brush up on my ping pong skills too

We love this place.  The drive through is super convenient.  The staff is friendly.  Their drink concoctions are out of this world!  And the cookies are delicious.  They sell Sweet Tooth Fairy cookies which in my opinion is ALWAYS a good idea.  I love their black and white cookie and my husband adores the oatmeal cookie. If I bring him one back he never complains about how much I've spent on pop.   The inside is very tastefully decorated.  They have awesome benches.  And I'm not just saying that because my BIL made them.  It can be kind of loud, especially when it's busy.  Which it always seems to be.  But it's kid friendly and casual and a fun place to go.  If you are a pop lover you need to try this place asap.  I love the Big Booty Judy and the Coke O Lime.  My kids love Happy Camper and The Shark Attack, (of course) although a few times we've had an attack sans shark when we ordered through the drive through and my kids were pretty bummed.  I wish they still have out menus at the drive through to keep in my car.  Sadly they just have a laminated one.  This place is awesome!

Cutest decor and convenient location!  The warm waffles are out of this world!  The toppings are generous and delicious.  The serving sizes don't seem huge but they are absolutely filling.  The fruit is fresh and the cream divine.  There is no bathroom located here which is unfortunate.

We decided to try this place that is quite close to us and order take out last night.  And I'm so happy we did.  It was some of the best Thai we've had in a long time!  The food was fresh and deliciously made.  A 30 minute wait time made me happy, knowing preparation went in to our food.  We ordered the rolls, which were yummy.  The Larb which was served with cut cabbage, I've never had it that way and really liked how light and refreshing it was.  We also ordered beef drunken noodles and Evil Jungle Princess Chicken.  The noodles were out of this world, the best I've ever had.  The Evil Jungle Princess had so much depth and sweetness and it was very very good.  The portion sizes were very generous and we will be enjoying the leftovers for lunch today.  We were so impressed, and will definitely be back!
