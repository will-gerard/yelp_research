Unbelievably rude waiter named Terrance.  My son and I walked in and sat down at a six top, waiting for four more to join us.  It was our first time ever going,  he walked by us three times before coming over to us.  He pitched the menu's on our table and asked what we wanted to drink.  I had been excited about getting a real espresso before lunch and told him we had never been here before and asked if they had a drink menu.  He rattled of "full bar, coke products and water".  I asked If they had any types of coffees,  and he said "yeah I can get you a coffee,  or an espresso" .. Well If you have espresso then you can make cappuccino right?  I asked for one of them,  some water and a Dr Pepper for my son.  He brought back the drinks with no water, and then got irritated when I asked for water!  He walked off,  didn't at all ask if we wanted bread while we looked at the menu.  I had to flag another waiter down, in order to get our waiters attention, rudely he said what else can I get you?  I had  a 20.00 out and said a to go cup and the change for our drinks. He said sorry we don't have to go cups,  took my money came back and laid change on the table,  no receipt, and walked away.  So then I had to ask ANOTHER waited for a receipt.  The same dude walks up and writes on a piece of paper 5+3=8, shoves it towards me and walks off again. Called the folks meeting me and said we are meeting somewhere else,  this place is a dive!!  Pausing to write this review before we find another place.  6 people X  35.00 average plate X minimum 20% minimum tip..  It would be interesting to see the owners profit..  Or lack of it.  Said one Bears fan in Scottsdale..

I love the Bento Box lunches, such a steal and always amazing!! The sashimi is always fresh, the green tea is wonderful, and recently they have hired more staff that are familiar with the food!
