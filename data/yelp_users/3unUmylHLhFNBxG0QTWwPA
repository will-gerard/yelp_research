We attended one of the Sunday in the park events Sanctuary holds; which was really nice.  It was a more intimate setting in a beautiful grassy area in the center of the resort.  It was full but not overly crowded and everyone could see the preformer.  There were servers for food and drink and the restrooms were close with no lines.  The resort itself seemed really nice, but we did not stay here.  It was a bit tucked away to find.  I will be attending another social/music event here!

My sister and I went here to experience something in Vegas with a bit of local flare and we were not disappointed! I too agree that the dates are a must have as well as the sangria! Go here if you want some great food, a good atmosphere and affordable prices!

This was the best theater I have been to in the Valley that serves food & drinks in the movie. Great lobby, statium seating, clean and friendly service. I'll be back!

I just returned to the Church after quite a long hiatus, and have really been welcomed into this parish.  Franky I am not sure if i would still be going if they weren't so welcoming! If you are looking for a positive Catholic experience please try OLPH!

Went to Scenario last night at Bar Smith. The venue while a bit small was tight. Especially the rooftop lounge! The music was bomb!  Too bad it was a Wednesday night...no matter I'll be back and I definitely recommend checking it out!

Just tried Scratch for the first time, and was pleasantly surprised!  We only went for a cup of coffee and dessert, but after that morsel I'm definitely going to try the meal selections! Yum!

This deli is right next to Honeywell on 19th Ave & Deer Valley so it really gets busy at lunch! However, I have never had a bad meal here! And the Cobb salads are AWESOME! the only thing I would warn you about is during the week after the lunch rush they do run out of some items. I look at it as the food is definately fresh every day!

My boyfriend and I came here on Sunday after church.  When we arrived we were one of 2 tables in the restaurant which leaves me wondering why the service was SO SLOW...  We had never been here before, and are not going back.  In addition to the service being extremely slow (friendly, but otherwise in no way stellar) the food was over priced and completely unremarkable.  We each tried a 3 item BBQ plate with 2 sides; pork ribs, beef ribs, sausages, pulled chicken, pulled pork and brisket  Not one of the 6 had any outstanding qualities, poor flavor, cheap ingredients, dry and chewy...  I had the coleslaw and mixed veggies as sides and while they both seemed fresh they both were also very BLAND.  My boyfriend had the mac & cheese and loaded potatoes, again NOTHING to rave about.  In sum, after about 30 seconds of sampling our wasted $21.99 per plate each we agreed that we will never return to this establishment.

Yeah....tried this place on a whim as we were walking by and I needed some coffee for the house; and an afternoon caffiene jolt. The place was very clean and neat, but....if you in any way shape or form like a strong coffee with solid flavor DO NOT go here!  This coffee is weak and watery both fresh from the storefront and when made at home. Even with a turkish grind and extra coffee added to the machine in an attempt to achieve flavor and a kick.  All in all I do not understand these great reviews; in my opinion if you are looking for a watery beverage with little flavor and maybe a hint of caffiene go here.  Otherwise skip it.

FANTASTIC culinary tour with a touch of history thrown in for good measure! I recommend this highly; make a reservation now! :)

I've never been to this shopping center/Pita Jungle location before and I was really pleasantly surprised! The restaurant was large and very bright and clean. There was a big patio out front that looked inviting even with the 100 degree temperatures! The waitresses were attentive and the Roasted Vegetable Salad with Chicken that I had was really good! The next time I am over that way I'll likely stop in again.
