Captain's Log, Stardate 2009-09-17.    Stopped in this junction of the galaxy last night with three friends after spending all day moving my Captain's Quarters.  I was sporting my skimpy blue retro work-out shorts with white trim, as I was tired and wasn't in the mood to even change.  I garnered a few odd glances (such to be expected) but we were quickly seated.  I tend not to do buffets now, as I'm really trying to watch my weight, but this place was recommended to me by my Lieutenant.  I'll be beating him later, but I digress.    The food was pretty marginal overall.  It was definitely NOT hot enough.  Replicator food on the Enterprise is better than this.  Want to piss me off?  Serve me tepid food and then charge me $8 cubits a head for same.  Some items were better than others.  I almost think there were too many choices.  I'd like to see the choices narrowed, the temperature increased and the food quality improved.    As for eating sushi in a place like this?  No way in Hades.  Not last night, not today and certainly not tomorrow.  I'd rather chase Khan with a crippled ship in a nebula before I dine here again.  Overall, C-  There has to be better choices for buffet Chinese food in central Phoenix, and I'm on a mission to find it.  "Engage long range scanners, Mr. Sulu.  We must find a suitable class-M Chinese food planet in this sector."  :D  --don

I'm not really a fan.  The place seems awfully crowded and it is hard to navigate.  What is worse, though, is to charge me $6 for a Red Bull with no liquor.  Bunkhouse usually charges me $2.  The back patio is small and skinny, whereas the usual clientele is not.  It is what it is.

Much better experiences than what I experienced in my initial review.  The prices are now more in line with that other bars are like in Phoenix, and the owners are very supportive of the community, which should count for something.  I may have been in a cranky mood when I posted my initial review.  Nice patio with good seating and shade.

One of my favorite places for a bite to eat.  There aren't many gay establishments that serve food in Phoenix - this is likely the best.  Their sliders (I've had them on four different occasions) are awesome.  Three pool tables, typical sports bar, but with a friendly, eclectic clientele.  Staff are friendly, although a little slow with table service from time to time.  Very open-minded and I've always had a ball in the place, no matter what I'm wearing.

My partner and I have been to Elephant Bar many times, and it never disappoints.  You walk in and are immediately struck by the warm, safari-esque decor.  Giant palm frond fans twirl lazily above, while a cool blue backlit ceiling dominates the heavy wood fixtures.  This time, we went straight into the bar and camped out in one of the over-sized booths.  The restaurant was not as busy as I remember it in the past, and we were there at about 5 pm on a Saturday.  Still, there was a good crowd.    Our service was impeccable, as the servers were very attentive and efficient.  The food came out fast.  Since it was happy hour, we ordered a bunch of their discounted appetizers.  Sometimes we like doing "picky food" as we call it.  We started with the coconut shrimp skewers and the butterflied fried shimp with cocktail sauce.  Both were elegantly served and very tasty, perfectly cooked and quite enjoyable.  The sauce had a nice little kick to it, without being too hot or bland.  Next, we moved on to the Vietnamese spring rolls, which unfortunately were chilled and a little weird, stuffed with shrimp and vegetables.  They were almost a little jiggly, and as I have texture issues with food, I had to be careful here.  The peanut sauce served on the side was tasty and saved the day for me, but I would have preferred the spring rolls cooked, as I'm not a fan of sushi and this sort of reminded me of that.  The vegetable relish in the middle of the spring rolls plate was pretty good, though.    Next, we shared the hummus, which was also very tasty.  We did run out of the hard pita chips (I would have preferred soft pita but that's just me), but it was so good I finished off the hummus with my fork and practically licked the plate, until my partner slapped me up side the head and told me to stop being a pig.  Finally, I ordered the $3.50 tomato soup, which came looking somewhat oily and liberally laced with sour cream.  It tasted really good, despite the oily appearance, and it was quickly scarfed up.  With beer, our total for all of this was under $30, so I'd say it was mission accomplished in spades.  The prices are reasonable and the food portions are ample but not gargantuan.  Overall, I give this a B+.  Good service helped ticked that up a notch, and we will be back.  Go here, go often, and have fun.

My favorite gay bar in Phoenix.  Great outdoor patio, great indoor TVs with surround sound, friendly staff, fun clientele, pool tables, cheap drinks, and I can wear anything I want?  Hell yes, where do I sign up?  It's as close to a gay cheers as you can get in Phoenix, and my costumes are always a hit.  Service is excellent and always served with a smile.  I will stop in here from time to time to shoot a round of pool or two and always enjoy the experience.  You won't be disappointed, unless you are young and hot and only want eye candy to look at.  This is a real men's bar, not a twink club or meat market, although hot guys do come in from time to time.  It's also friendly to all types, not just gays.  This is one of the few places in Phoenix that serves up food from time to time as well.  Go here, go now, and go often.  It's that simple.

Decent place.  I often come on undie Mondays for a few drinks and a round of pool or two.  Weird crowd with mixed vibes, sometimes friendly and sometimes not.  Bartenders are getting to know me so they are becoming more friendly, but this is not a homey country bar at all.  More like one of Phoenix's largest gay bars with lots of space to spread out.  Can be packed at the right events.  I'll keep going back as long as I have fun, which is the ultimate factor.

Was there last night and had a good time.  I learned several things:  1.  Charlie's has a cover charge of $3 if you get there after a certain time, I believe this starts at midnight or 1 am.  I got there after 1 am and the place was packed, absolutely packed.   2.  Yes, in Phoenix, some bars can stay open until 4 am (gasp!).  Yes, I know, it blew me away as well.   3.  The little Mexican food place attached to Charlie's serves really good food late night, but now I understand why they can't sell water or soda through the inside window to Charlie's customers.  That's because Charlie's wants to charge patrons $2.50 for a bottle of water than the Mexican restaurant sells for $1 outside.   Other than that, I had a good time.

I've been here many times and the food never disappoints.  Is it the best mexicano food in town?  No, but it's pretty good.  I'm partial to the gyros chimichanga, which sounds bizarre but is absolutely fantastic, and the baja chimi, although the latter could use more spice in the sauce.  Overall, a nice experience, and not judgmental at all, I can come in wearing just about anything after a night out at the bars and have never had a problem.

Worst experience ever at a restaurant/bar!  Rode the light rail to Mill in my trademark skimpy blue shorts.  Walked up Mill and heard about this place, decided to try it out.  Went in and the staff was less than courteous.  I guess only the employees can dress in skimpy attire.  I ordered a beer and soup, then I asked for a group shot with the girls and was so rudely denied, I immediately got up and walked out without finishing my beer or waiting for the soup.  Hooters, upstairs, on the other hand, on a different date, was a refreshing experience by comparison.  The girls loved me and we had a great time, and they were more than happy to pose with me in my miniskirt.  Next time, skip the Library.

Great independent coffee shop with really good coffee, great service and amazing clientele.  This, Hob Nobs, Luci's, Urban Spoon and Copperstar Coffee, along with Cartel Coffee Company in several locations, are my favorite independent coffee stores here in the Phoenix metro area.  If your dilithium crystals are running low, dock at any of these eclectic coffee shops to get your fix on.

Fez is the one restaurant I expected to be treated better at.  I went there one June evening with a gay friend.  I was dressed in a skimpy but fun costume (if a bit over the top), as I was on my way to some parties later on.  After all, those of you that know me know this is how I roll.  It's certainly legal, and the leather shorts are very short.  Yet Fez refused to serve me.  I was summarily ejected hardly a minute after I set foot in the joint.  This is the same costume that has passed muster at many other locations, including the light rail and many other bars and restaurants, but not Fez.       Now, that being said, on past trips, the food has been good, but any place that would do such a thing canot receive a maximum recommendation.  I'm partial to the cinnamon/cumin soup, but I won't be dining here again voluntarily.  I'll take my restaurant business to Ticoz or Roscoe's on 7th if I need to eat out.

I'm a big fan of this place.  Not as pretentious as Fez, more welcoming, down to earth, and the food's pretty darn good, makes for a great place to hang out with friends and chat.  I've been here about five times over the last two years and never had a bad experience.  Never been hassled about my attire.  Service is always decent, decor is nice, and the food is interesting if a bit pricey.  Still, I think it is worth it.

Kobalt is one of my favorite gay bars in Phoenix.  Unfortunately, I don't get out all that often, but when I go here, I always have fun.  This is one of the best-looking bars in Arizona, with really nice decor and attentive staff.  Hidden inside of an old shopping mall, it's a little hard to find, but it's worth the trek.  Speaking of Trek, "make it so, Number One."

Bar One has recently completed their new outdoor patio to the south of the building, and it is very nice.  No longer do you have to sit under that ancient blue umbrella on 16th Street.  The interior also looks good.  I usually go on Wednesday nights, which are undie nights, where you can often find me playing pool.  I like both bartenders, and they are fast and attentive.  The drinks are good and the clientele interesting, to say the least.  Another yelper mentioned "Mos Eisley Cantina" which had me roaring laughing, as there is some truth to that, although Alec Guiness' famous line "a more wretched hive of scum and villainy you will not find" may not apply.  In any event, go and have fun.  The fun factor is high here, and in the final analysis, that matters most.

I had a fun experience here back in January.  I had lost a Superbowl bet and was required to wear a skimpy plaid miniskirt and go-go boots with a shirt that said I bet on the Cards and lost.  I was required to go to Hooter's on Mill and so I went with a friend to get the required photos.  I was not sure how I would be received.  As it turned out, I had nothing to fear.  The staff were warm and welcoming, and absolutely excited over my attire.  I got my photos with no hassle and we decided to hang and drink/eat.  The Coronas were nice and cold and the wings decent (but not fantastic - just decent).  The fun staff more than made up for the 3 star food, though, and many insisted on getting their own photos with me.  Overall, a fun experience, and I will go back here again.

This bar has been closed for quite some time.  There's not much hope of it re-opening anytime soon.  This means Phoenix is probably the largest city in North America (metro pop. 4.3 million) with no gay leather bar.  Velocity and Bunkhouse are sort of filling the bill, as best they can, but these were big shoes to fill.  I always enjoyed Cellblock (also known as Padlock back in the day), but she is sorely missed, and needed.

My partner and I had a nice experience here last week when we dined here for dinner before the El Divo show at Dodge Theatre.  We had a tasty appetizer, the crab cakes, together.  I had one of the soups, which was nice, and he had the mussels, which were extremely tasty.  There were also a lot of them.  It was very pricey but it was an elegant experience.  The service was great and we will go back again.  The atmosphere was extremely elegant and the place well decorated.  We might eat in the lounge, though, to save a few bucks next time.

I've been to both America's Tacos restaurants - one on 7th Avenue and one on 7th Street near my workplace.  The food was excellent on both occasions.  Perhaps a little pricey, but then again, I like good food and I will not lie...no other brother can deny.  Oops, sorry.  :)  Anyway, go here and you will not be disappointed.  Great outdoor patio seating and good food...the combo can't be beat.

Dealt with the manager, George, last month, when I brought my car in for a oil change and checkup to ready my car for a trip to Las Vegas.  He's like "I hope you aren't planning on taking this car to Vegas."  LOL.  As it turns out, my car was 22,000 miles PAST the recommended factory service guide of replacing the timing belt, at 60,000 miles (I had over 80,000 miles).  I didn't have much money and not only did he work a nice discount for me, they had the ability to carry a payment for 30 days so I could get the work done.    Very professional, friendly and good people here.  And no, I'm not related to them in any way, shape or form.  I will be using them again.

This place, formerly known as Taylor's Tavern, is now called Rainbow Cactus.  We had an Imperial Court of Arizona show there on Saturday, 8-1-09.  There was a nice crowd in there, many obviously regulars.  The bar is a good size with ample seating.  The drinks were good and the staff attentive and fun.  There are no drinks on the patio allowed, and it was a bit warm inside (AC taxed?), but other than these two minor quibbles, the place is rockin' and fills a need in far north Phoenix, far from the Gayborhoods of central Phoenix.  An isolated outpost in suburbia, Rainbow Cactus surges forward, chartering her own course.

This place opened a few months ago within walking distance of my condo.  I never ventured in until last night, when an out of town friend took me to dinner.  It was Monday night, and they had a $5.99 spaghetti special that I didn't even know about.    The place was packed when we arrived, and the decor is quite nice.  The ambience was good as well, with muted conversations all around us.  We were seated quickly and the service was quite fast, especially considering the crowded nature of the place due to the special.  We ordered an appetizer of special egg rolls ($7.50) filled with steak, chicken and ground beef.  The steak one was the best, but all of them were great, and the spicy sauce for dipping was amazing.  The little salad on the side was a nice touch as well, along with the standard roasted bread they bring for free, served with oil and vinegar.  Yum...yum.    We both ordered the special and it was really quite good.  The meatballs were pretty good and much better than Buca di Beppo's nasty meatballs.  There was a little too much sauce, but at least it was slightly sweet and tasty.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, and overall this is one of the better dining experiences I've had recently, much better than The Old Spaghetti Factory I went to Sunday night with some friends.    I give it an A- and will be back with more friends soon.  Very soon, in fact.

Went in here last week and had a great dining experience as always.  I had the green chile chicken burrito which is divine.  About the only thing not super fantastic was the quesadilla my partner had, but still quite tasty.  Overall, a nice dining experience and we will be back!

Velocity is transitioning to fill the giant shoes of the now defunct Cellblock/Padlock.  As they say out here in the west, "them's some mighty big shoes yer fillin' boy."  I wish them all the luck.  This is a dark bar, with two pool tables and no attitude.  The staff are friendly and attentive, and that matters a lot to me.  They apparently have male strippers on some nights.  Some of them need to be tied up more often, methinks.  Anyway, this is a good bar, but it will take time to fill the hole in our hearts that was Cellblock.
