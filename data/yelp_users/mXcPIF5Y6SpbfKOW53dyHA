Flowers by Jodi was the best experience we had out of all our vendors!  Everything was very easy and streamlined from my point of view and my flowers turned out Amazing!.  I couldn't have ask for a better experience and I was so happy to have Jodi and her team be a part of my big day!    We found Jodi after meeting with three other florists and having a three terrible experiences.  Jodi was completely different (in a very good way) than anyone we had talked to.  I called and let a message which Jodi for an initial consultation.  She returned my call herself within a timely manner and we set up an appointment that was convenient for me.  I was very impressed upon meeting Jodi.  She has a great personality which immediately puts you at ease and puts a smile on your face.  She is so excited about life and what she does that you can't help but get really excited about your wedding flowers too.  Jodi only does wedding flowers so she really knows her stuff!  One of the most important things to note is that Jodi really listened to my vision and my ideas for my wedding flowers.  The initial consultation took about an hour as I had lots of ideas, but Jodi was very patient and always made me feel comfortable.  I felt like she really understood my ideas and I felt good about the meeting when I left.  Jodi sent a quote via mail and email just a couple of days later.  All the paperwork and emails were very professional and easy to understand which I really appreciated.  I contracted with Jodi for a minimal deposit which I also appreciated because it can be quite unnerving paying out a large sum of money for services that wont happen for quite some time.  Jodi understands this and her deposit amount to hold the date was very reasonable.  The date of our wedding was over a year away and my vision evolved during this time.  Jodi was absolutely amazing to work with.  She was always happy to meet with me and make any and all changes that I desired.  She returned phone calls and emails promptly and really made my life easier which is wonderful when planning such a large event as mine.  Payment was also very easy.  A final invoice was sent once my date was close and Jodi happily accepted credit cards (I say this because for some reason a lot of our other vendors would only accept cash or check.)  My final invoice was clear and exactly what I expected with no surprises or hidden charges.  The day of the wedding came and Jodi and her team were amazing!  First the bridal party flowers were stunning.  Jodi did a great job of creating modern arrangements using gorgeous white Calla Lilly's.  I was so very pleased with my bouquet!  The flowers were more beautiful than I could ever imagine.  Second, the flowers for the reception were spectacular.  Jodi created close to 100 arrangements using absolutely brilliant giant dark blue hydrangeas!  We had so many compliments on our reception flowers.  Our guest were in awe!  We will definitely be recommending Flowers by Jodi to everyone we know who are tying the knot!

My husband and I thought this would be a fun family outing...who doesn't love food trucks?  We couldn't have picked a worse idea for our Saturday!  If you like waiting in long lines for mediocre food that costs a lot of money, then this is your event.  We arrived and had to pay a $12 entrance fee per individual.  So for our family this equated to $36 (our 10 year old was free).  Once inside the gates we waited in a long line for tokens which were required for alcoholic beverages.  It was also unclear if tokens were needed for food.  We came to find out food could be purchased with tokens or cash.  We ate at a total of 5 different vendors (not not all the vendors actually had food trucks.  Some were trailers and tents.) We felt all the food was way overpriced.  I paid $4 for a grilled cheese no better than what I could have cooked at home.  This was the cheapest item we had.  Most of the  vendors seemed to be completely overwhelmed which meant the food was very slow to come out.  All this along with the lack of seating, shade, and trash cans made for a very bad experience.  I would not recommend this event and think your better off visiting your favorite food truck on the city streets.

I 100% recommend this Salon.  Trini has done my hair for 4 years now and I am always satisfied!  I also bring my children and the staff is amazing when cutting their hair from my little girls long locks to my teenage sons ever changing hairstyles. The salon is modern and beautiful and of course I can always get great products too!
