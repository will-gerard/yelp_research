Called Troy to provide and install a back yard gate. He responded quickly and came out right away to take measurements and provide an estimate. I never received my estimate and when I asked if he had another job that was delaying him I received no response. Seemed like a nice guy but no follow through and I am still looking for a back gate.

I have referred Rob and Sandy to many family members and clients of mine over the years. He and Sandy are extremely thoughtful, thorough, trustworthy and the definition of professional.  I highly recommend them and know they always have their clients best interest in mind over their own. They truly get this is a relationship/customer service profession and are not just after the next commission but want the best possible deal for their clients.
