The first time I went here, I was living at some apartments just down the road at Papago park.  I had only lived in Phoenix a couple years and where I come from there wasnt much in the way of BBQ so I didnt know anything about it other than I've had ribs before.    I walked up to the counter and a very large black man hears me say "Uhh, I'd like to get a rack of beef ribs please".   He barks back "Boy, you dont want no beef ribs.  What you want is pork ribs" Being the skinny half Korean kid I was, all I could say was "Yes sir"  I'll tell ya, that changed my life.  Pork ribs, especially the ones from Honey Bear, make beef ribs taste like a McDonalds McRib sandwich.

Very tasty place to eat.  They have really good tartar and cocktail sauce.  Im good with a 1 piece fish and 2 piece shrimp & chips meal which doesnt cost much at all.  Then when you're all done, head across the street to the topless bar ;)

Holy smokes, you want how much for ice cream?  Then again, you're looking at a guy that just buys vanilla and if I get a little bored, squirt some Hersheys Syrup in it and mix it up.  I guess the ice cream is good, but when I can go and buy a steak at the grocery store for the same cost, every bite I sit and imagine that I could instead be eating a ribeye cooked at home.  Another thing occurred to me, what would it look like for someone to be an ice cream kneader if they werent high school aged?  Well maybe it would work if it were an older guy with a handlebar mustache.

This will be my 20th year since I discovered this place.  The cool thing is everybody that works there now, has always worked there.  They're always very nice to me and give great service.  I've had a few different things from the menu and have never been disappointed.  The French Dip is phenomenal however the one thing that I beg you all to try is the Super Sicilian sandwich.  Get it exactly how they make it, dont ask for anything left out or put on extra, just try it one time.  I seriously ate it the first 10 years I went there without even trying anything else.  It is my favorite sandwich in the world.  This is a Mom and Pop restaurant and has a great cozy feel of it.  Its such a great thing to have in a world of Subways and Quiznos where the food is bland and the faces are never the same.  I live 40 miles from McGurkees and still make it a point to stop in and get food as often as I can.

The wait is pretty long here, its a quite popular place.  Went once, had a bunch of margaritas and I think ate dinner, dont remember what it was but it was hot!

I've been to many dentists and an orthodontist over the years, so I've certainly seen enough to form an honest opinion.  As a kid, my dad took me to an ex-Army dentist, he was good at his job, charged a good rate but was by far the least gentle of any that I've ever known.    My girlfriend recently found out her wisdom tooth was cracked and infected.  We took her to the closest place and they recommended an oral surgeon, uhh I think you can buy a forclosed house for the price they charge to pull teeth!  Not to mention the soonest they could do it would be 2 weeks.    Mom mom went to see Dr Yi at the Family Dentistry a few years ago to fix a broken crown and she was very happy, so I called them up.  They got us in the next day and she was in and out as well as all 4 wisdoms in 1 hour.  I think she's the first one I've ever seen excited after getting out of a dentists chair with 4 less teeth, the cost was also extremely reasonable and very far short of what we were quoted for other dentists and the oral surgeon.

Food of course tastes the same or very similar to every other Subway.  I did want to get on here and say the service was decent and fairly quick, considering the dinner line that was there when I showed up.

Grew up on Mike and Rondas in Flagstaff.  Its awesome to have one here where I live now.    I cant really tell you about anything there but the Steak Strips with Eggs meal, because thats all I ever get.  I'm addicted to it.  I'm a simple guy that doesnt care for the frills, just a place to sit, a clean table and good service.  If you want real food cooked with plenty of love, this is your place to eat.

First time I ate at this one, got a great server.  She was very friendly, spot on with taking our oder and getting our drinks/food out.  I had the Steak Fajitas, they were good, still sizzling when they came out.  Was very happy with the experience.  Second time, was December 2009, was sat at a table that had a hurricane blowing down on us from the A/C vent.  Waited 10 minutes before anyone showed up for me to even ask to have it turned down, then another 5 minutes for our drink order.  I ordered the Ribeye Steak, my 4yo son got mac & cheese, my girlfriend got a buffalo chicken sandwich.    40 minutes goes by (and the place wasnt even busy), drinks completely empty, our food comes out.   My fries are soggy like wet shoelaces, my steak that was supposed to be Medium was cooked all the way through and cold by the time it made it to the table.  I'm guessing it sat under the heat lamp the entire time.  I hate sending food back because.. well i've seen the movie Waiting and it terrifies me.  But for a $20 plate thats so gross i cant even eat it, i have to do it.  15 more minutes goes by, my replacement comes out and its cooked more to order but tastes like a $3 manger special skirt steak cooked with a cigarette lighter.  After one bite, i left it.  Total bill was around $50 for 2 adults and 1 kid.    I'm never going to this Chilis again.

I love the way it looks inside.  Its the new bar in town so everybody goes, though i will say it is a much older crowd than the other places in town.  I went on a Saturday, they had at least 5 bartenders working.  I found it really hard to get a drink, sure it was busy but I've seen 2 good bartenders handle the same workload without a problem.   I finally got my beer, handed him a $20, got change for a $5 and he was out of sight before I could even say anything.  2nd time I came in I stood there and got bored of doing so before being helped and left.  Maybe they can get the kinks ironed out down the road and it will improve.  They got the patio finished and it is quite nice!    I recommend it if you're over 50.  Just not the spot for me.

Went there for the first time a couple weeks ago.  When I go for sushi, it pretty much consists of Nigiri Tuna and California rolls, I'm not a hardcore sushi eater by any sorts.  Service was good, was seated right away, took my drink order, came out.. My drink never got empty before a replacement came out (big plus for me).  I ordered one of their sushi meal things and requested it all be tuna (you get to pick), GF orders something, I think it was Teryaki beef..  Couple minutes goes by, another lady comes out and tells me I cant have all Tuna cause its too expensive.  Hey.. I'm an easy going guy, I shrug my shoulders and say, "cant you chuck another $5 on my bill to make up for it?".   I'm not sure what she said, but apparently that was ok :)  Food comes out, I had a bite of my GF's meal and the beef was cooked very nicely and the sauce was great!  My sushi was good, you cant really expect too much out of Tuna and California Rolls other then they just be fresh.  I noticed they have some nice Happy Hour stuff.  There was a flier floating around inside that said it was 2:30-4:30pm, looked like some good deals.  When I was leaving, the window said a different time for the Happy Hour special, no biggie.. I might go back and check it out

They decided last week to have a $1 sandwich day till 2pm.  I drove by at 1:50 and there was a line out the door!  I waited a while and went back 2 hours later and the line was gone.  To my surprise, they had an entire list of $5 sandwiches anyway.   The radio was a bit loud whilst I was eating there, I think I've been to a quiter Megadeth concert but I guess I remember being young once and subscribing to the school of thought that if my ears didnt ring when it was turned off  then it wasnt lound enough.
