This Doubletree looks like it was at its prime in the 90s and I could see this place being very nice back then. Today it looks old and outdated but its still very clean. My room had dated decor but it was very clean, bed was comfortable, and the free breakfast was one of the best I have had. The other perk to this place was the price for $100 a night its a steal especially since you are near the airport and your getting a suite. The downfall to this place is there really isn't any restaurants or bars that are within walking distance and the $10 wifi charge.

I really wanted to like this place since I really dig family owned businesses I guess I will start my review by saying I ordered via phone but when I called I got an automated system that was horrible and didn't route you to anyone instead it said to call another number. After placing a huge order they said it would be done in 30 minutes. I went to pick up my order an hour later and it was still not ready and ended up waiting another 30 minutes when I looked around it seemed that everyone there was waiting for food and no food was being served in a timely matter. After finally getting my food I really wasn't impressed.   Pulled Pork-Dry Brisket-Dry Sauce-Weak and needed spice Baked Beans-Very good especially with the sausage  Hot Links- Not bad but not spicy Coleslaw- Very good  Corn Bread- bland and tasted old

I am a huge Hilton fan and have stayed at several Homewood Suites across the nation and this one is by far the worst one I have stayed at. First I booked my room requesting a smoke free room and was given a smoking room. When i went to the front desk to switch rooms they told me they were sold out and I requested a smoking room.. so I go and get my itinerary showing I reserved a smoke free room. After finally speaking to the manager they get me a smoke free room.   So after walking in and looking around I am just disgusted with how old, dirty and dingy everything is. I mean this place still uses comforters... what hotels still use them especially when your paying over $100 a night. Then the bathroom looks about the same quality as a motel 6 and the dirty green carpet from the 80s definitely needs to be changed and the nice 3" of dust on the ceiling fan wasn't to impressive. If your considering this place do your self a favor and go to the Hampton Inn and Suites over at 16620 North Scottsdale Road. Its a lot cleaner and way better service.

When you first step into Houston's the first thing that comes to mind is.."Wow this place is pretty cool" Its very modern and they offer a simple menu. I had there prime rib and it was great. There filet Mignon is also very good as well as there ribs. The other good thing about this place is there friendly waitstaff.

I have spent many nights in this place due to work and its one of the nicer hamptons in the area by that I mean newer. If you do stay here I say upgrade to the suite for 10 bucks more. Breakfast is free and pretty reasonable for it being free. They also offer a courtesy shuttle which is nice and its close to the new outdoor malls.

Guido's is awesome! I came in not expecting Chicago food and left full and surprised that the food tastes just like it does in Chicago. I had the Chicago roast beef sub and it was great. This hoagie roll was loaded with hot roast beef, peppers, and onions along with some dipping sauce. I will definitely be going back to this place when I am in town again.

When I first pulled up to Cigar King I thought this was going to be a small little shop with a small selection.. Well I was blown away when I walked in.. Not only do they have a massive selection of cigars but they also have a huge cigar lounge which is pretty sweet. I wish we had a place like this back in NM.  Not only does this place sell cigars, they also sell watches and shaving products. I think I just found my new favorite shop!

This place is pretty sketchy. I came here early in the am after a being at Marquee Nightclub all night. I came just to get a few lap dances and then call it a night. I asked the taxi driver to take me to a good strip club. Funny thing is the taxi driver first took me to a massage parlor. I told the dude no just want to go to a decent strip club so he brought me to Cheetas. I walked in and right away a great looking Brazilian girl walks me in sits me down asks if I want a drink I say sure so she orders one for her self and for me. No big deal we shoot the shit talk for a while then she asks if I want a lap dance. I say sure I will take one she walks me to the back. gives me a dance 20 minutes later I ask how much she tells me $250 I say you must be joking right? Next thing you know I have 2 bouncers telling me to pay up. I have no choice than to pay or probably end up beaten up and thrown in the alley. So I pay up and leave.. Not only did I pay the $250 but she also kept reaching my pockets and taking the cash that I had in my pocket as well during this dance. Talk about a bunch of thief's. This place is a joke and I wont be coming back here ever again!

First off I will say I am a New Mexican and have lived in NM most of my life so I came into this place thinking I was going to be disappointed. Well... I was wrong. Blue Adobe knows how to make some killer New Mexican dishes. I had there Carne Adovada enchiladas which were excellent. The Carne Adovada was tender and cooked to perfection. Chips and salsa were also really good although there chile and salsa could of been hotter it was still good. The only thing I was disappointed with were there margaritas. There silver coin margarita was weak and not worth the 10 bucks.

So my friend told me this was the best sports bar in Scottsdale and I had to check it out so I figured I would go on Sunday to check out the games when I first arrive they have all the games playing on different TVs and they seat you based on what team you want to watch. The downside to this is if you are coming with a group only half of your table can watch one game and the other side of the table is watching another game which was annoying.   As for the food I was told there wings were amazing and hot so I ordered some hot wings only to find out they smell hotter than what they really are they were also pretty standard nothing amazing. I also ordered a green chile cheeseburger which was really good it was a pepper jack cheese burger with green chile from NM which made me feel at home. They also make homemade fries and onion rings which was a plus.   Overall there are better sports bars around, food is ok and nothing special would I go back? Maybe...

I have always seen the great reviews about Charleston's and always wanted to try it but it just reminded me of a Bennigans which I cannot stand but I finally decided to give this place a shot.. I sat at the bar for lunch which was empty but I didn't mind since I got served right away. I went with what the waitress suggested which was the ribs and I am glad I did. These ribs were cooked perfectly and the meat just fell right off the bones. There baked beans were also amazing especially since I am not a fan of them I actually enjoyed Charleston's baked beans and there fries were crispy and good. I tried there Perfect margarita but it wasn't perfect since it mostly consisted of margarita mix which I can see considering this place isn't a Mexican restaurant. But overall I was impressed with Charleston's and will probably be back.

I usually stay at the Hampton Suites when I come to Scottsdale but they were booked so I thought I would try out the CourtYard. I was really impressed with the rooms they were modern and clean. Staff was very attentive and helpful. I would stay here again next time I am in town.

This place rocks! I would of never thought a place like this existed especially in a shopping center. The beer selection is seriously like I died and went to beer heaven. They have a ton of beers on draft as well as a huge selection of bottled beer you can grab from the fridge and they will pour it for you in the appropriate glass. I didn't get to try there food but heard it was great.

Really didn't care for this place the rooms were old, the breafast was cold and frozen, front desk was rude your best bet is to pay a bit more and go to the other Hampton inn and suites that's up the road

This place is a total hole in the wall you walk in and it seems like your in the middle of Juarez. the roof is covered in bean sacks, tables are made of crates, the place doesn't take credit cards cash only but the food makes up for it! Awesome fresh burgers cooked in front of you also a good local beer selection which is served to you in a mason jar. Gotta love it.

I have been to a lot of airports but this place is just a madhouse. This airport is way to small and over crowded and they really need to think about expanding this place. The food options are crappy and mostly just fast food, they offer free wifi but its pretty much useable, and there restrooms here are pretty disgusting. The only good thing about this place is the taxi services/ limo services and the baggage arrivals.

Talk about some great drunken munchies after a night out on the strip. This place cranks out burgers in minutes and there really good. There not In-and-Out good but still really good. The place does get crowded and packed and you also have to deal with alot of drunken people but overall not a bad place to go.

I came here looking to cure my hangover looking for some great tacos. Well I dropped by on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. They offered all you can eat for 24.99 or so so I went ahead and went with it. I tried a few things on there menu but all of it just didn't hit the spot. I am a huge Mexican Food snob especially coming from New Mexico but all of this food was just "Gringo" food there was no spice to anything and all of it was pretty bland.  Even if the food was bad the service should of made up for it but I was wrong. I sat at the bar area and was ignored the majority of the time. I kept having to get up and ask the hostess for things as well as to pay. I really wouldn't recommend coming to this place at all.

The Trump is a classy hotel. Not only is it in a good area but it is one of the few hotels on the strip that is smoke free and doesn't have a casino inside which could be a good thing or a bad thing. Although the good thing about this is the whole hotel smells like suntan lotion which is a lot better than smelling cigarette smoke!   I was offered a great deal with the trump were I had to go to a timeshare meeting so I got a killer deal on a 2 bedroom suite. The rooms are huge! Mine had a king sized bed, pullout sofa bed, living room, kitchen with subzero full sized fridge and freezer, and 2 bathrooms. The master bathroom was enormous and even had double shower heads which I fell in love with and there was also a washer and dryer. The trump also offers shuttle service to the Wynn and Caesars Palace but I found it was just easier to take a taxi since every time I tried to use the shuttle it was a long wait. Overall I highly recommend the Trump! I will be coming back in the future.

This is a total dive bar has the decor of a dive bar, smell of a dive bar, waitress of a dive bar, and customers you would find at a dive bar. Staff was friendly and attentive, jukebox had some great songs for everyone and the food was really good they have a great selection of burgers with a ton of fixings. I came on a Sunday night so there wasn't many people there but from the looks of it, it seemed to be locals where everyone knew everyone, cool little place I will stop by next time I am in the area.

I was blown away by this place after my meal I sat there trying to find something negative about this place and honestly I couldn't think of anything. The food was spectacular, the meats were cooked perfectly, salad bar was full of great choices as well as quality products. The wait staff was professional and attentative before my glass would become empty a waiter was on his way with a refill and same with the meats. I would highly recommend this place to anyone.

Great classy sports bar with lots of TVs, good food, and long list of beers on draft. I came here on a Monday night to watch the Cardinals game and the layout was great every direction I looked there was a giant TV there. The only downfall was the wait staff they took forever to bring out drinks and food that's the only reason for the lower rating.

TK's was a major disappointment. I was in the the area and was looking for a place to have a few drinks and eat a good meal. The reviews for TKs seemed ok so I thought I would give it a shot. I came in around 6pm and sat at the bar. The Bartender didn't seem to pleased to be there I ordered a Bulliet and coke and what a shame that was but besides that I figured I would try there food. I asked for suggestions and the bartender recomended there porkchop with mac and cheese. I agreed to that and 30 minutes later my meal came. The Mac and Cheese was ok I enjoyed the green chile it had in it but really needed salt. The pork chop on the other hand looked better than it tasted. The pork chop was so tough it was bending the steak knife. After all this I get the bill which was 45 bucks. So to sum up this review, Drinks are weak, Coke is syrupy, pork chop is dry and tough, mac and cheese is bland, and prices are to expensive.

Small little tap room near the airport and found a pretty unique beer here watermelon ale is awesome! Staff is very friendly and gave me some tips on hot local resturants and breweries. Another plus about this place is you can see the actual brewerry and watch them brew beer in front of you.

OHSO has a great beer selection with not only there own brews but other brews throughout Arizona they also have a full bar if craft beer isn't your thing. I didn't get to try any of there food but it all sounded pretty good and looked good from what i could see. I will be coming back next time I am in the area.

Grassroots is simply amazing. They have a great selection of beer and wine on tap as well as a simple but delicious menu. I had there chicken and rib combo plate and I have to say it was great. The ribs were so tender the meat just fell of the bone. The chicken was also very tender and juicy. The homemade colsaw was fresh and tasty. Everything about this place is really good. I would recomend it to anyone.

I love Hilton and have been to Hiltons all over the nation and I also love the Trump in Las Vegas but the Elara is really lacking in customer service the whole time I was staying there it seemed as if I was just being a burden when ever I had to ask for something. Besides that the rooms really were not to impressive especially for them calling the place a resort as my room was really small and was never cleaned my whole stay which kind of left for the low rating.   What I did enjoy about the Elara was the convenience of having the Planet Hollywood mall attached to the Elara which made for easy access to Planet Hollywood and to the mall and restaurants. The pool over at the Elara is also really nice and the smoke free and casino free hotel made for a better stay. Overall I probably wouldn't stay at the Elara as their are better hotels on the strip for a cheaper price.

Being a big fan of breweries i was not impressed with this place. They only had 3 of there beers on tap which I really didn't care for besides the Double IPA. The food smelled and looked awesome which I will have to go back and try but as far as beer goes there are better breweries around town.

The name alone is worth checking this place out because if any of you have seen any of his shows he strives to be the best and well this place is almost just that. I can honestly say I have never had such amazing service in my life. Not only do they refill your drinks the second they are low but they also know what you want before you even ask its pretty awesome. But besides the great service the food is also really great. I had there lamb burger which was recommended by the staff. I was here for lunch so its unfortunate i wasn't able to try there dinner menu. There prices are sort of high but then again it is Vegas so that is kind of expected. Overall its a great place and well worth checking out.

Amazing beer selection along with excellent burgers it doesn't get any better than that!  I stopped by BurGR on a Friday night and the place was packed but staff was friendly and very attentive although it seemed as if they had memorized a script they all were professional and gave excellent service which is pretty much expected coming from a Gordon Ramsey establishment.   As for the food burger selection was simple and delicious also cooked perfectly. Prices were fair especially being in Las Vegas. Overall I was satisfied and will be back!

After reading all the great reviews about there fish tacos I had to check this place out for my self. This place was a pretty awesome place I really liked the tables that were shaped like surfboards. The food was really good and healthy. Like others have said the fish tacos were good but not the best. The prices were a bit high for lunch but then again fish isn't really cheap. This place also offers local Hawaiian beer which I also thought was cool. Overall if you looking for a place thats healthy and good this place is worth checking out.

Hopdoddy has everything I like. Such as a wide variety of craft beers, fresh margaritas, fresh tasty burgers, unique crispy fries, and friendly staff. I had the prime time burger which was cooked to perfection and was one of the best burgers I have ever had. I also had the truffle fries which were on my top 10 fries list. If you are in the area I highly suggest checking this place out.
