So, I came to visit a friend in Arizona and after a weekend of hearing about this place, we came here for our farewell lunch. Poor decision.   Perhaps I am just spoiled by Mexican food in my area (and the fact that I am half Mexican and often cook Mexican food at home), but the food was awful.   Between my husband and myself, we ordered an Enchilada sampler and a Bean & Cheese Burrito - simple right? Apparently getting the food right is not a priority at this place. The green sauce on one of the enchiladas was more of a cream sauce with cheese - seriously disgusting. The bean and cheese burrito obviously used canned beans instead of anything fresh and the tortilla was crispy (not on an awesomely good way either).   Our server was attentive and the Margarita's were decent (the original is refreshing and good with a meal, the strawberry I could have passed on), which are the only reasons that this place is bumped from a One Star to a Two Star review.  If you are in search of awesome Mexican food, this is NOT it. If you want a super sub par meal with mediocre drinks, head on it.  I will likely not be back, ever...unless it is at my friend's request - even then, it's a maybe.

First and foremost, I LOVE Cracker Barrel, so it pains me to write this review...  I suppose I am just spoiled by the amazing Cracker Barrel chains in the South that I've experienced, but this place doesn't hold a candle.  I ordered breakfast, which was just alright. I ordered Cheesy Grits and they were terrible - under cooked, no flavor whatsoever, and just had cheese on top. Gross.  The pancakes I ordered were no better. They were covered in oil... to the point where I could squeeze the pancake and have it drip oil. I abandoned them after a couple of bites.  The staff was super friendly, so plus one for that, but this is by far the worst experience I've had at this chain... ever.  I don't think I will come back.

A friend of mine and I stopped in to grab some meat, cheese, and wine to celebrate her move to AZ.  We got all of the awesome stuff we needed, then wandered into the bakery section and spotted cannolies... The gal behind the counter gave us an extra one at no charge, which made us happy and eternally grateful later in the evening!  As much as I love WF, the price tag is always a bummer. Good food = high prices though, so I suppose I will suck it up!

Targets were on the pricey side but ammo was priced well, as was lane rental. I went with a group and it was Ladies Shoot Free day, so I ended up paying for the ammo and the targets only - but others paid for the lane rental.  Overall, I enjoyed my time there and will likely be back again. It did get a bit crowded for me, but I can deal... it is about the guns, not the people!

Holy shit, this place is heaven.   The menu is a great size, the ingredients were fresh and delicious, the desserts were awesome.  Since this is a stoner themed place, the decor and names matched. It felt so cozy and friendly and down to earth there.  I cannot wait to come back here and get another sandwich. If you're a local, you should visit and enjoy - even if you're not a stoner, it is SO worth it.

Every time my husband and I go to Vegas, we make it a point to have dinner here at least once during our trip.  Every experience we've had here has been A+ and 5 Star.   I normally start my dinner with their Lobster Bisque, which I love more than most people. Second up would be the Fois Gras, normally a special and sometimes on the menu - paired with some type of fruit compote and deliciously creamy. Third, always my A5 Filet with Yukon Gold Puree and/or Wild Mushroom Risotto. I finish up with Vanilla Bean Cheesecake and coffee.  My husband, well, he is all over the place and orders something different almost every time. I will say, he has NEVER been disappointed.   We almost always get a bottle of wine, or bring our own if it is a special blend or occasion, to have with our meal.   Now, for all of this amazing food, it is extremely pricey.  Our meals never total less than $600 for just the two of us. I assure you, if you plan on splurging in Vegas and want a solid and hearty meal - you go here. Period.  I love it and I totally plan on coming back again and again and again. Hope to see some of you there!

Alright, I found this place through Yelp and I am SO glad my fellow Yelpers came through for me on this.  When I pulled up to this place, I wasn't expecting much at all. They have chicken fingers, fries, and a special sauce that is to die for. Honestly, the portions were huge for the amount you pay and everything is cooked to order.   I was so happy and I cannot wait to go back again. I LOVE this place!

My second visit to Rock n' Roll Fingers was just as awesome as my first.   Two words come to mind when I think of this place:  Fresh & Flavorful  Seriously, everything is awesome here and I can't imagine anyone disliking it. Nearby? Stop in, you won't regret it.

Service was wonderful, as was the atmosphere, but I found the food lacking...  We showed up and were seated immediately. Our group was waiting for another individual, so we looked through the drink menu (Coors Light on tap as a featured beer, seriously? WTF) and ordered our drinks while we waited. I ordered a Mojito and was expecting greatness, but was SO disappointed. The drink was super bland, no sweetness or mint flavor. Sad way to start out the evening.  Our fourth guest arrived and we ordered our appetizers (Calamari and Escargot) and ordered a bottle of wine for our meal. The Wine list was disappointing, but the wine we chose ended up being suitable. The Calamari was alright, not as crispy as I would have liked, but a nice flavor. The Escargot was also decent, but the flavor was a bit off.   I had ordered Prime Rib with a Twice Baked Potato and shared the Truffled Mac & Cheese with a friend. The Prime Rib was very tasty, but also super fatty and didn't have a nice char on the outter edge - which happens to be my favorite part of the prime rib. The Twice Baked Potato was alright, but nothing special. The Truffled Mac & Cheese was made with truffle oil and was actually very delicious... I wish I could have eaten more of that!  For dessert, we shared a Brownie Sundae and the brownie was glorious! I wish the ice cream could have matched it, but no worries... delicious brownie ftw.  The atmosphere was great, as was the service.   All and all, the experience wasn't horrible and I would likely be back and order a steak and some mac & cheese with no drinks from the bar.
