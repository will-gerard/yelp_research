I've only been here for brunch once....it's the shit.   They had me with the "ATTENTION BALLERS, no $50 or $100 BILLS, PLEASE"  (I'll post a picture)  Basically my kind of place already.   It's a tiny place inside thus the 4 stars but they have a nice patio area with benches, tables and ect.   Food is like some concoction of amazingness. I can't even remember what I had, but it was tasty and full of god knows what, pretty much everything and anything one can think of. They also sell beers and stuff.   It's located in the garfield district right off roosevelt.   I heard it was once a food truck that parked and now it rests.   Go here for something awesome and different.

I was abducted on a hungover Saturday morning and takin this this place. At first I was a little nervous, it's in the hood, no sign saying this is even a business, bars on the ordering windows. But hot damn, this food was good. A must for a hungover, gut soaking meal.  I'll definitely be returning....just maybe with my gun next time. Haha jk

I've had a few friends over the last few years that have mentioned I try Bikram yoga. I had reservations, felt as a guy I'm not sure if I could be comfortable doing hot yoga.   Well last month my friend suggested this studio that she also attends class. So I finally worked up the courage and came to a class with her.  This studio offers a $20 2 week unlimited intro.  I have been going 2-3 times a week ever since. It has been about a month at the moment I'm writing this review. Everyone has their own favorite instructors, Justin is my favorite.  I have since lowered my blood pressure dramatically and can feel my stress levels decreasing. I think that partially has to do with one, the cardio I've been receiving from the class and partially the knowledge I've come to learn about how I deal with my stress and how I can let it go, remembering what I've learned in yoga.  They say at this studio yoga, true yoga starts when you leave class.   I really believe that now.   I would recommend this studio to anyone.

This Place sucks.  I'm 25. And back when I was a newly 21yr old I use to come here and get annihilated.  Look let me be honest. This place is GREAT if your 20-21 and want to pick up a drunk SLUT. And when I say slut...i mean dirty slut. During the day this place is like a ghost town. Only at night is when the activity picks up, usually only Friday and Saturday nights. The owner or head manager now, use to be the manager/owner (not sure which he is) at another crap hole, Casey Jones. Which isn't too far away. Anyway I digress....He is is douche. Racist guy. Kicked out my black friend one night because his pants were "baggy" and they were skin tight compared to the types that frequent in here.  To sum this place up, you might get stabbed, hit with a bottle or catch a std just by entering into this closet.

I enjoy dive bars. So i might be partial in my review.  But this place is cheap, been around for 20 or some years. At night your looking at a young and old mix crowd. I'd say 25yrs old and up.  Good tunes loaded in the jukebox. Punk, metal, classic rock, blues.  The food is great, its bar food, so it better be. Oh and the bartenders are the best. The two sisters working behind it are really sweet and always remember your drinks. The first time i came in i ordered a pbr tall can ($2) i might add. And the next time i came in the bartender literally cracked one and handed it to me without me asking. That's service!

This is a great place. I've lived in Peoria for years and for some reason never made it to this joint.   So a few weeks ago I'm on  date and figure I will give this place a try. I was BLOWN AWAY. Can't help but to be another person to say it's "cozy" environment was relaxing, but i just did, it is! The only thing missing was a fireplace. The food, I had a bacon wrapped filet, MED RARE, i enjoy blood. WOW it was great. had a HUGE baked potato, some good IPA beer and my date had some wine.   All in all, great place for a great night out for dinner, would come back!

This place is literally in walking distance from my apt. Although i try not to eat here often not because i do not enjoy it but if i did I'd be the "typical obese American" if i did. Its THAT good. But on occasion when i feel like, what the hey, then i spring and splurge on this place.   The pizza is AMAZING. The wings aren't the greatest if they were this place would of got that fifth star from me.   Oh and beer might be nice. But then again i know how expensive liquor liscenses are. It's amazing. Anyway, i suggest everyone try this place. BEST pizza in the west valley.

I don't know why this place has a shitty review. I love is place. Hands down the best sushi on the west side in my opinion. Prices are cheap and the quality is great. I've been to a few other sushi places on the west side and i never go back to those. I always come back to Bamboo.   The saki bombers are cheap and you can order the shrimp low mien which is so big you WILL end up taking it home as leftovers.   Great place. Don't listen to the haters.  If they don't like it they can go bcd to Scottsdale and pay double. I'll stick to local, friendly, quality and cheap.

So I've been here now twice. Both for live local music shows.   The radio show 93.9 a local indie station has put on some epic shows here.   This place is part inside, partly outside. So stages in and out.   Kinda has a Mexico vibe to it, reminded me of Rocky Point. The bar inside is cement and kinda beat it but whatever, I'm here for live music, nothing else.   Drinks are cheap but for some reason I always have a sorta expensive tab, ah funny how that works.   Cool place for some live music, in particularly local live music.   Check it.

I stopped by here on my way back to my office. Found it on yelp and figured "what the heck". So I stooped in, pretty slow just one table was seated. I wanted a take out. The waitress who took my order was a bit outta it or just shy.   I got a chicken gyro, fries, and a coke. All for under $7. It was HUGE, I ate half the fries, half the gyro, and half the soda. Which is probably good for my heart and overall well being. Nonetheless it's a pretty decent little spot.

So I went here for my first time, on a date. It was in the evening, dark. They had candles and torches lit. Very nice ambiance. We sat outside because it was cool. The pizza and wine was amazing. I'd definitely come back for a few drinks and food.

I just recently moved down to this area from the burbs. I was taken here on my first friday that I've been too since living down here. I must say, it was busy as shit.   But we stopped in here for a beer before we hit the town.   I really enjoy it so I decided to walk here the next day for a late lunch\dinner.   I walked in, ordered a sangria and a grilled chicken sandwich with chips. Read some of my book I brought, very relaxing and calm. The food was great, next I ordered a bloody mary, probably the best bloody I've ever had, it's $7 and HUGEEEEEE.   Great place, food n drinks.

A week ago I came here on a date. I've always heard of this place yet never seemed to know where the heck it was. So we arrived, it was a tuesday night so it was pretty slow.  The interior is small, cozy. Sorta dive bar-ish. Which is pretty cool. The prices aren't so dive bar-ish but the food was INCREDIBLE. Sooooo I guess you really do get what you pay for.   All in all this is a great place for dinner, and I even hear that breakfast here is amazing. Although I do hope breakfast is cheaper. Dinner for 2 adults, one beer and one glass of wine with run you close to $50.

So when I first moved downtown I came here with a friend. We were actually greeted by the owner, she's really nice and asked us if this was out first time in. She gave us some brief history on the place, it's been around for a long time. Fun fact, you can actually see a glimpse of this place in the movie psycho, in the background of a scene.   I've been back most of the times alone in a Saturday morning for a quick breakfast and coffee. The food is amazing, the prices are GREAT, and the service is ALWAYS friendly and prompt.   Place can get filled up but I've never really seen a line and personally I've never had a problem grabbing a seat.   Please support local and give this great business and great employees a chance.

So a few weeks ago I met two friends here for some drinks after work. On a Friday night.  I've heard a lot about this watering hole so I was excited to finally experience it.   I was very happy with the outcome. The only downside was the lack of notification, "sign" labeling this place. My two friends, lady friends, had trouble finding it because of this.  It's off of the "first Friday" street, next to the jobot's coffee shop.   The beers were awesome, I love me some IPA so I had a few. Wood floors, small so don't expect very many open places to sit on a weekend. But a live band was playing which made the experience complete. All in all a cool little hip place downtown for a drink.

I love love love this place. I come here everyday during the week and get my lunch sandwich for $4. Can't beat a healthy meal like that everyday.  I shop here all the time every since i watched "food Inc" and started eating heathier. I get my coffee which is amazing and cheap. Also i get my fish oil supplement pills here too. Oh and i love their DHA omega-3 milk here too.   I would have given this place 5 stars BUT it does have one downside. Only one though!  This sprouts is the farthest sprouts west AKA closest one to sun city. So people please be aware when you a parking you're vehicles. There are a TON of old folks here. Thus the lines at the registers tend to be pretty long as you can imagine.  I have talked to some of the employees that work  here and sprouts is planning on building another location actually in sun city/ surprise area so that will lighten the load on this one but that much be some time because of the economy.   Besides that, it's a AMAZING place.  Pls support and support local businesses!

Look maybe I'm biased because I currently live down the street and I ONLY, I repeat ONLY get 2 things off the menu here. SO I can ONLY vouch for those 2 ITEMS i do purchase. But they make BOTH OHHHHHHHH so good.   They have a house speclial FRIED RICE thats BOMBBBBBB ladies n gentlmen. I HIGHLY suggest it. I mean it's so good I write my name on it in my fridge, that good.   I also get the egg drop soup WITH cracker thingy's they sell for a little extra $. All in all when I call up to order these 2 items it takes them about 15 min to prepare and I go pick it up then enjoy.   Again this is the only 2 items I have ever ate here, Honestly I have no complaints about either thus why I don't change it up.

This review like the others is only for this particular chipolte.   I live down the street so i sometimes stop in grab a fajita burrito. It's simply AMAZING!  Only down side is the foot traffic. Its really busy because it's in the arrowhead area. So many eff'ing people especially around lunch and dinner. So many that i stopped coming for a long time.  UNTIL i found the chipotle app for my iPhone and iPad. I guess you can order online via their website too. But now i can just order AND pay on my phone. Walk straight in, bypass the line. (which i really enjoy because people in that long line look at u like ur crazy for cutting in line ha ha) then grab my food and leave. It's awesome.   So anyway i recommend this place.  Plus it's healthy compared to the crappy fast-food industry.

I'm updating my review for this place. It's really grown on me and is now my favorite bar off of bell road.   The bartender Chris is probably the nicest bartender I've ever met. A little tip about drinks.....Miller Lite aka my favorite domestic is always $3 from 8 to close. That's not advertised, so please thank me. Oh and they are the big boys, not the pint glasses.  I would give this place 5 stars, but every time I eat their chicken fingers, or pretty much anything here I have to drop a deuce in their bathroom (could just be my body's reaction to the oil they use to cook, idk). The food is really good or I'm a glutton for punishment. But the downside, the men's bathroom at least is always really hot, even in the summer. Like they cut off the air flow in there or something. Plus sometimes the slobs out in this world feel the need to piss on the floor or break a toilet, overflow it. So a deuce has to be dropped before 9 o'clock usually to ensure clean, uninterrupted status.   You know I like to facebook and read the news while I'm doing my business.    Other than that, this is NOW the BEST bar off of bell road. Sad to see a lot of bars come and go since 2007 when the economy took a nose dive. But this place seems to have made it through.   Chris and Z are my favorite bartenders. Some other quality good looking waitresses. The patio area is huge and nice for smokers, even though I'm not pretty much all my friends are so I'm always out there, plus the TVs are nice. The bar also opens up so you can order out there.    The DJ is horrible that plays name that tune, it's so loud, but oh well. Personally I'd prefer if they just used a video DJ. But then again I'm a nerd and I like to watch cool stuff like that when I'm drinking and pretending to listen to whomever is trying to talk to me.  Oh I forgot to add, the only other downside is the UFC nights which they charge a cover for. I hate covers and I really hate the UFC crowds. Thankfully as soon as the fights are over, that crowd usually quickly makes a move for the exit.   Thankfully.

This place is KICK A**! First of all they have great service. I love all the bartenders at this place. I normally do not go to the servers but Ive gotten to know a few and they are all pretty enjoyable. Drinks are at a great price, for example $1.99 Pacifico's EVERYDAY from 8-close. They also have great CHICKEN TACO'S, and a amazing green chilly cheese crisp. The nightlife is awesome, always some good looking women in here on the weekends. They just recently added flat screen tv's for us sport fans or whatever they have playing on the tube. That mixed with the newly (fixed) mist system is great for those hot weekday/weekend days in the summer heat. I would give this place a 5 star but I haven't experienced enough food on the menu to give it that 5th star.

The beginning of this year was my introduction to yoga. I started off at another great studio on Camelback and Central, practicing Bikram Yoga. After about 6 months I felt it was time to expand my yoga horizons. Bikram Yoga was great but I had never in my life experienced downward dog (bikram doesn't do that pose). The yogi community is amazing and from the Bikram studio I was introduced to Urban Yoga. The studio is a nice mix of people with a zen atmosphere. They have 2 studio's one is the Front and Large studio, then the rear studio which is smaller and more intimate.   I'm very structured and maybe also coming from Bikram I really wanted to start and build my base with this entirely new type of yoga so I started attending Urban Yoga's Foundation classes. Nicole Hamic is the instructor for these Foundations classes. She is amazing! She is very technical, and breaks down the poses at the same time giving students tips about how your body feels and what breathing is good or not good to do in certain poses. I believe she has experience in body care, massage. I attended these foundation classes for about 2 months and felt VERY confident moving onto my first flow class because of her instruction. PS, her class isn't something to sleep on either. You will be holding poses, you will be sweating and you WILL FEEL IT. =-)  In between my initial Foundations classes I was also supplementing with some Zen classes. Zen for those not aware is about relaxation, deep stretching poses with bolster, blankets, blocks and sandbags. A great class to unwind, relax, maybe even take a nap in a deep pose. I was impressed with a few instructors during those Zen Classes, Nacy and Emily are both AMAZING, they take time to introduce themselves before each class to new faces and ask what they need, any issues, pregnancies, what they want to get out of that particular class.  On one occasion I took a Zen class that was instructed by Hamid and was impressed, especially with his Gong at the close of class.   Because of that experience with Hamid's instruction for the Zen class. I was intrigued to move onto my first Flow class, which Hamid teaches on Tuesday Night's at 7:30. It's called Candlelight Flow to Zen. This class is always busy because it's a seriously amazing class. Let me start off by saying there is live music during this class. An awesome guy whom I met, Alexis plays guitar during this class in the front of class and sings. So while you are flowing through your Vinyasa he is playing slow, melodic music which is totally great. My first class he started playing a acoustic version of Princes Purple Rain while I was in Downward Dog, had the biggest smile on my face. (Love me some Purple Rain).   Hamid is no joke he will push you, make some funny jokes and has awesome instruction from flow, to power to zen. You will get it all from and out of his classes. I think he's my favorite Instructor at Urban.   Parking can get hectic, it's covered in a parking garage but some spots are reserved for the condos above Urban.  TIP: there are a lot of spots to park if you go to the south side of the garage. They all say they are reserved but actually aren't.   The staff has always been on point and welcoming at the front desk. They check you into class, answer any scheduling, payment, or even yoga tips since they all practice as well. You can download the mind and body mobile app that let's you sign in/view the week schedule for the classes as well, just remember to also sign in when you get to the studio.   So anyway, sorry about this novel, I could actually keep on writing but I think if you read this far you've felt my passion and happiness i've experienced at this studio. Please try it for yourself.   Namaste.

Well I live down the street from this place. And I hate coming to it. First reason; drink specials. Or may I say the lack there of. For women they have some pretty good specials but for us men I think this place figures since all the servers are in school girl outfits they are doing us a favor. Honestly I careless about the servers and what they wear. It's no strip club. I come there for one reason only, a beer. And when it's over priced it's not worth it. The food at this joint is also crappy, only the french fries are ok. I recommend going to Salty Senoritas if your looking for a good bar  & food and atmosphere right down the street.

So I have never had a pedicure before today. I was a bit nervous about the entire deal but figured what the heck.   I called and spoke to the receptionist Desiree. Who was wonderful, she got me in the same day for a roughly 1:30 appointment. I'm almost always early and arrived around 1pm. Desire checked me in and was very professional and pleasant. While I was signing in a esthetician who was waiting on her client and I sparked up a conversation, I believe her name was Melissa. She was awesome and made me extremely comfortable, very warm soul. She must know her stuff because her skin was amazing.  Bee did my pedicure, and actually got me in at around 1:20! She was amazing. Maybe it's because that was my first pedicure but I thoroughly enjoyed it.   While I was sitting I enjoy people watching, and was watching this nail tech working, Kaeleigh. She was pretty beautiful I admit. But the client she was working on seemed to enjoy her and her work. So I'll probably be okay saying shes great professionally.  All in all a great first time experience and i'll be coming back.

I've only ordered take out, so vie never experienced a sit down meal in this place. So just reviewing off purly food. I really really like this place. And I'm born in new york, so ive tasted really good Chinese food before.  This place is decently priced and overall great tasting food.  Plus is literally down the street from my apt.  Always a plus.

So I've been hearing about this place for the  past 5-6 months since I've moved downtown. I finally made it here. It was a cold night so we sat inside. Hostess and servers were really friendly (it helps I met a regular here). I liked the ambiance inside. The drinks were great and so was the appetizers. Sweet potato fries and shrimp rolls, bomb.   Then I had the chicken wings, they had this different taste to the sauce, not in a bad way. Hard to explain it. But I'd definitely recommend them.   What really had me, sucked me in and will have me back. They have a projector that was playing movies onto a wall. The original Batman series, like from the 70's. Yeah, the nerd boy in me had a big O. Then after, they played the old school stop motion Christmas story movie.   What what!!!  Oh and I just happened to find out a girl I went to high school with is a part time bartender here. Her name is Selena. She's very sweet, ask for her, great personality.   I'm holding off on the '5th star because drinks are sorta pricy, but hey that's why Seamus isn't that far. :-P

Maybe I'm too spoiled from living near Padre Murphey's and RTO Sullivans, but this place just isn't up to par.   The Beer is actually good, I like their bar and drinks selections.   But the Food and menu is horrible. Wing are shitty, I'm not a huge fan of Irish food but at least Padres has THE GODFATHER which is probably the best sandwich I've ever had. Plus their wings are awesome.   Also the customer service here sucks, bartenders hardly notice you when sitting at the bar or act as if its a chore to take your order.   Irish I know you're one of the only bars in surprise but step your fucking game up. Because once a better bar opens up, your going to be in trouble.   I much rather make the drive out to 59th ave and bell to go to RTO's or to 43ave and bell to Padre Murphy's.   In fact today I'm going to meet a friend at Native New Yorker instead of this place because the food sucks so bad, and I know I can count on Natives wings.  *UPDATE* So apparently Native New Yorker is closed, so I ended up meeting my friend at Irish Wolfhound, figured, geez what other place could we really go too, especially on short notice.   I had a burger, it was horrible. The fries were actually okay, not the greatest but better then the burger that's for sure.   We tabbed out after 2 drinks and talked. Well after talking for a while we decided on another beer. Waited and waited for our server to come back around and when she didn't I just went to the bar. I was STANDING at the bar for a while, even looking at the bartender in the face as she cleaned glasses yet didn't acknowledge me and there was maybe only 3 people total sitting at the bar. FINALLY she comes over and I order 2 IPA's.   Our server then comes back around and makes a comment like "oh you're still here?"   Uh wow.   After talking for a while longer with my friend, (we were sitting at a hight top) I put my feet on the open seat next to me to rest them while I chat.  then another SERVER actually comes up to me and says, "Excuse me sir, we don't allow feet on our furniture".  I had fucking shoes on and it's a fucking bar, i'm actually sitting indian style before and after that on my own seat and on my shoes anyway.   REALLY RUBBED ME THE WRONG WAY. I'll NEVER be coming back, FUCK this place.  Downgrading it to ONE star.

I just moved in across the street. So I have been walking here and grabbing a pastry and or a mocha.   This place has two entrances, one in the rear, or the main door located right off of roosevelt.   The staff are very very friendly, even the people whom frequent this spot are very pleasant, I struck up a conversation with a man while I was waiting for my mocha just the other day.   I stopped at the fair trade cafe just up the street and that place is rated very highly but I had a horrible experience there so I recommend this place much more over the latter.

I live right across the street. Been coming here for 4-5 months now. This pita jungle is the best in the state in my opinion. Service is awesome, the location is awesome. The food is just as good if not better than any other location.   Sky is a great waitress, so is Janice, and Phoebe, those are my go to servers/waitresses! Sometimes I'll get a togo, or i'll just have a beer and eat in.   I've met some very cool people from the neighborhood just eating here and sparking up some conversations.

Best shop hands down.  Lex did my half sleeve a year or two ago. Puerto Rico theme. AMAZING work. Great shop, great atmosphere. Everyone in this shop is a professional. You're paying for GREAT artwork people, that is permanent, on your body.   I haven't  had a chance to go back and get more work, but planning on having Lex finish and extend my half to a full sleeve.

So me and a lady friend stopped here for a night out a month back.   We arrived, there seemed to be no self parking or maybe I'm just not aware of it. Because it was just valet at the front. So i of course had to valet it. Which to me is odd. I'm not a huge fan of a valet service. I'm a big boy, I'll park my own fucking vehicle, FOR FREE. But whatev's.   I tried to bypass that. We entered and found a both near the bar. The food is a mix/hybrid/fusion of mexican-new mexican food.   I forgot what I had at the time. But I remember it being REALLY REALLY good. We also shared a great bottle of red wine that our server recommended to us.   The service was awesome, the food was amazing. A bit pricy, but like i've said before. You get what you pay for.   Definitely a place to check out, a wonderful date environment.

I enjoy dives. When I'm in the mood for a "dive". And this can't be more of a dive.   But hey it's cool, usually good live local music. I hear they are trying to get more and more bands to play. Buddy of mine works for kwss 106.7 independent radio here in the valley and has sponsored some shows here. Mostly punk and metal which i get into.  This place has NO KITCHEN. Which in my opinion a bar with no kitchen. It's a true bar. Kinda cool. They have like a original house freezer where they keep their mugs. That i think it's pretty damn cool.  Very cheap shots and cheap beer. My kinda place, when im in the mood.

Okay so maybe I'm biased because I really hate douche's and high prices for my BEER. But here we go...  I live on the north west side of town (arrowhead). So i'm closer to the other Sandbar on northern and the 101, that place is pretty hood, and this sand bar is the complete opposite...but i digress.  A friend was moving back to jersey and she wanted to meet here for drinks. I got here around 10pm on a Friday night. It was extremely packed, but I found parking, no biggie. I did like how they have a lot of taxi's lined up at the front door just encase you might need one, which I love because I cab it everywhere when I'm consuming alcohol.   No line yet at the door, I get right in with some friends. We get a table, high top somewhere. I will admit, there are some smokin hot ladies in here, and some cute cougars as well. Funny thing is, these chicks all have high heels on and when they are walking in the sand, I was hoping i'd see at least 1 eat shit. Didn't happen, then again I didn't sty long.   The atmosphere here is a typical Scottsdale douche bag bar/club. A lot of guys wanted to bang some hot girl, and a lot of hot girls looking pretty yet it's pretty obvious that they have ZERO personality.  I went to the bar to get my and my friend a beer. "2 Coronas please", okay, that will be $10!. Uh what the fuck did you just say to me, I asked for 2 coronas and you're telling me it's $10 for 2 fucking beers. I literally paid because I wanted a drink, hung out for a little then took off.   The over all douche bag aroma, mixed in with the high prices for a beer turned me the hell off. I'll stay on the west side, or any non douche establishment around town and wont ever come back to this place.

So after a few drinks at the lost leaf I walk to this place with my two girl friends. It's a pretty sweet and clever idea to have a cinema bar theme, that actually plays movies, TV shows and ect. Tables are really low, sorta like Japanese style but other than that this place is definitely worth a stop in. Check out their fb for times and events of movies and tv shows. I know they show the walking dead weekly when it's airing on the network.  Oh and don't forget to grab a bag of popcron while you have a cold one.

Great place. My buddy beef vegan from Kwss 106.7 FM hosted a cd release party for Mergence, an the kongos.  My first time there. Place has a great vibe, very good prices on drinks. It was a little hot in there but I guess that's to be expected with so many people watching a Show.   All in all, I'd totally go back.

I grew up with my parents believing in chiropractic care. Now that I'm entering my 30's it feels like someone flipped a switch and my body isn't recovering like it used to.   So I slept wrong or ended up pulling something in my upper back/neck in yoga class.  I was in need of relief so I ended up contacting Soleil Chiropractor and Wellness. I conveniently live down the street and have had a massage in this building previously (the art of touch, massage shares a building).  Dr. Soleil went through my medical history and was spot on with my issues, I had a rib that was out and was locked up on my upper right neck.  After a few adjustments she had me right as rain. I've been keeping up with every other weekend appointments just too fix some minor issues, low back since I drive a lot as well as am pretty active.   She's very sweet, helpful even a common cold she will have you take some vitamins or spray's she carries stocked in her office. (I'm a fan of natural medicines derived from roots, super foods, instead of pumping my body full off processed meds).   I definitely recommend you at the least give her a call and if you are reluctant chat with her about any issues you might be experiencing.

I have now been to this establishment 2 times. One was to buy a usb snes controller to hook up to my mac. The other was because my SNES original machine has a power plug ripped out of the rear. I took it in and the guys in house fixed it for me on the spot. Just cost me $10 for a new power adapter.   This is a small mom and pop like store and I really respect that. Customer service is great and they have a HUGE selection of "vintage" games.

BOMB.COM   Look I'm a traditional ICE CREAM kinda guy. I was raised on Baskin Robbins in Brooklyn, New York growing up. But this shit, is the next best thing. (Plus people claim it to be semi healthier, in all honest, who the hell knows.)   They have tons of toppings, a decent amount of yogurt flavors, all at a really good price.

I'm torn. I LOVED the ORIGINAL CHEERS. It was a dive, and what a dive should be. Dirty, cheap, skanky, good music, GREAT bartenders that were personable but also didn't take shit, and also remembered your face and what beer you liked. The bouncers were cool, and if some guy deserved to get his ass kicked they proceeded to take him outside and turn a blind eye if he DESERVED it. The bathrooms were filthy, really disgusting, yet I know plenty of women who have had sex in there, haha, but hey it is what it is.   So these new owners want to "clean" it up. Yeah I guess the original had it's run and it might be nice to spruce this place up. Okay, i'm cool with that. But I have some information for the new owners to help them out a bit....  New OWNERS, if you want this place to succeed, and not end up late tailgaters (shitty, and smells like vomit), Chilly Bombers (filled with young sluts and bro's), oh and the late SMOKEBOX, oops I ment SKYBOX (deceased, and for many reasons), listen up:  1. Don't alienate the ORIGINAL CHEERS clientele. They were die-hard, they loved THEIR shit hole, mostly because it kept out the rest of the douches that were at the other 3 shit places I just talked about.   2. DON'T RAISE THE PRICES. This isn't Fox n Hound, or Tilted Kilt, both of which suck and their drink prices are way to fucking high. If you want people to come around and stay, make drink prices cheap. So if that means you have to shop around for the lowest prices on your distributors, then do it, you're a bar and it's the most important thing to majority of us out there, next to atmosphere, that we think about as patrons. Nothing more mad me happier then paying $2 for a TALL CAN OF PBR at the ORIGINAL CHEERS. Yeah it's shit beer, but shit beer that cost me $2 for a TALLIE, taste really fucking good!  3. NO COVER, EVER. Covers are gay, don't have them. No one likes them, respects them, and most people try to avoid them.   4. FOOD, If you're going to have food, make it tasty. ORIGINAL CHEERS had amazing wings! Find that recipe and roll that over.   5. EMPLOY cool people, from the NEIGHBORHOOD. ORIGINAL CHEERS was a local neighborhood bar, no pun intended from the tv series, but really it was. So please hire people from around this area that we all might know, because listen that just helps out everyone in the long run.   That's it for now, if I think of more, i'll add it.   Heed my advice, and  you will be successful, Wish you the best.

Did you see the short guy walk in with a group of people last night, stop, look around then walk out......if not, that was me.   So, listen I understand wanting to make this place different than the original cheers. But when you build it to look EXACTLY like TAILGATERS, you clearly aren't separating yourself from the rest of the bars off of bell road.   I walked in, saw how the light were bright, neon, fucking neon lights, and metal walls, i nearly threw up in my mouth.   I walked over from RTO's which is where I hangout, and in my opinion the only good bar off of bell aside Santisis now a days.   No I didn't grab a beer, or check out how the service was, because after walking in I was so disgusted and sad to see what this place has become, I just left with my head hanging.   Sorry Owners, you just turned cheers into tailgaters.  ----Response to Tim, the owners comment---  Look bud, I understand you wanting to run a successful business man. And yes there were people there. Which you are correct, a lot of older people seem to like it. And if that's the type of crowd you want to attract, well then you might be successful. As far as the demographic between the ages of 23-36, I don't feel it's going to be successful.   I was with a group of people, mostly women, they went to the bathroom, came back as I waited at the bar and they and I quickly agreed lets get the hell outta here and go back to RTO's.  Look man, I'm trying to give you helpful constructive criticism. Because A LOT of people in my age range loved the old cheers. So you're already fighting a uphill battle. We all love the area and are sad to see so many bars go with the tide in this economy, we just want a great place, that's DIFFERENT from the rest to park our buts on the weekends and take out minds off of whatever.   I wont be coming back unless it's the last choice on my list of places.

This is the type of management/ownership running this establishment now.  I posted on the "Cheers Tavern" facebook page, saying I disliked the bar because of the management/ownership and received this  inbox message. I of course knew the ego on this guy just couldn't resist replying, obviously just like he does here on the yelp page.   I quote:   Tim Montague GO FUCK YOURSELF you fat FUCK!!! Your little rants/post will never hurt my business...EVER!! Funny 99% of the old Cheers crowd love the new Cheers. The other 1% are the ducebags like you who pissed on the bathroom floor and thought your tough guys by punching holes in the walls.....Don't want you or any of those P.O.S. back in my bar. Don't EVER step foot in Cheers again....you will never be welcome!!!  Screenshot: http://i49.tinypic.com/33d9z80.jpg   Classy.

I've been here multiple times. I'm a guy that loves beer.   The ONLY reason why I'm NOT giving this place 5 stars...They have a HUGE, actually 2 HUGE chalk boards where they post the 30-40 or so beers they have on tap. Which is awesome. But I like to sort of have a selection of different types and a history on the beers, like where they are from ect... The servers usually know but not every beer. So you either have to ask, know or look up on your phone, plus it's sorta hard to read, just overwhelming.   Other then that, the patio is dog friendly. I've spent a day or to on it drinking with a friend and her dog just relaxing. They even have water bowls for the dogs.   The food selection is a bit limited but they best thin on the menu is the meat pizza, the shit is probably one of the best pizza's i've ever had.  Oh and you can fill up your personal growlers here too.

I just moved down here to this area. So I biked here. from my place off of 4th n roosevelt.   I met my neighbor, had a few beers and pizza. It was a joy to enjoy pizza this good, and I'm from Brooklyn, NY.   I recommend anyone in the area that enjoys pizza and beer to stop here.

I broke my acoustic guitar string early Saturday morning. Called revolver records store and they sent me here for strings.   I rode my bike up here, nice little house, that's the business. Can't miss it, big sign. Cool people greeted me, no douche musician types that don't want to help you. We chatted as they rung me up. They told me they also carry vinyls here as well. Good prices, I'll be back!

I met a friend here for lunch. She works across the street and informed me this was the 1st week this establishment was open.   The interior is very nice, new, sorta has that "Flagstaff" feel to it. We walked in during noon-ish so it was busy. I immediately notice that the staff are all women, hot women. Unfortunately they aren't the brightest. Example....the hostess checked her seating chart and asked us if we would like a booth, we both said yes and then another waitress arrived along side her and they both commenced to bickering about sitting another party at that booth.  We both let them continue for a few minutes because it was amusing seeing this then we finally chimed in and said the bar will be fine. lol  We sat at the bar and I started to look around. I noticed, and so did my female friend, there were hardly any women customers in this place. hahah I counted maybe 3 including my friend.  Okay so if you weren't aware and I wasn't either the servers all wear skimpy outfits, very similar to titled kilt's.  This location is located in the heart of the "corporate business park area". So literally 90% of the patrons were middle aged men, in business casual to corporate suites, probably 70% or more married and come here to look at the women, I always wonder why that does it for most men, I mean why not just go to a strip club at least there I know and expect what kinda service, vibe I'm going to get, plus the beers are cheaper and you get a better view if you know what I mean, but I digress.   So hardly any women customers, we both ordered a drink from the bartender, she came back with my IPA beer overflowing, probably the most horrible pour ever but I was trying to give her the benefit of the doubt. Oh she asked me if I'd like "the girl size beer, or the man sized beer". I'm not sure if that's company policy or she was trying to be cute. I mean I wasn't offended but it felt like an awkward question to ask, I went with the girl one, I admit.   We both ordered food, I had the ranch grilled chicken sandwich, with fries. The bartender seemed very ditsy and clueless but she managed to get our orders correct.   The sandwich was okay, at first a little bland but once I got to the middle it was actually tasty.   We paid and left. I'm not sure I'll make an attempt to come back.   I have a feeling after a few weeks, months the hot waitresses will probably quit and they will have to hire better customer service, more competent women to fill those server spots. I sorta got the feeling that when hiring they just put out adds for hot girls in their early 20's and if they were hot enough, they were hired, no matter of their skills......that will only last for so long, it's a restaurant, not a strip club.

I found this gem via yelp. Down the street from my place and next to the lost leaf so I figured I'd give it a shot.   I walked in and met Nicholas whom works there. He gave me some suggestions and history about this place. Had me sample some different types of ice cream.   He was super helpful and the ice cream was amazing.   Apparently everything is made locally and the building itself is very quant, painted pink with neon signs at night and a sweet wooden patio area.  They serve their ice cream in a couple cones or a oriental rice/to go box in 2 different sizes. Very cool idea!  This is in the art district of downtown phoenix. I support local but even more importantly I support quality.   This place is both.   :-)

Okay so I've been coming to this VIG location even before it "officially" opened.  I will say that I have never been to another location. So i'm just basing my experience on this location and this location only.   I am a bit spoiled because I live in walking distance as well.   The patio is amazing, during the beautiful weather days this is THE spot downtown to be. At night they have heaters both the propane and electric ceiling units mounted above the bar/patio for chilly days/nights.   The service for me has always been on point. Very quick, timely, polite, and never lacking when it comes to a drink refill or a suggestion (food or drinks) also great at informing specials.   Monday nights they do $5 burgers, which are cooked to ones liking, i prefer mine med rare.....YUMMY.   Beers are usually around 3-4 dollars depending, can't beat it. Cheaper on one of their many special nights.   Weekends they do brunch and their brunch is amazing, I've had a burrito here with a bloody and it was sooooo good, I walked home and took a nap. Damn thing put me to sleep.   Sundays they have half off wine bottles and bottomless mimosas ($15) from 11-2.  Basically if you are downtown, this is THE place to stop in.   Enjoy

I've been here 3 times now, Once was their opening night, and 2 other times since. The pizza is simply amazing. Decor in side is great, service is awesome. My favorite server is Nick, he seems to be really cool and always remembers me when I come in.   He also gave me a rundown of the history of this place, it started off a food truck and still is by the way, but they decided to start of this more permanent location very recently.   This place is located directly south of the old spaghetti factory, maybe 300 yards south. Come in, have a drink, lounge and eat, it's great!

So I was experiencing some lock up vertebrae in my upper right side of my neck. And had a slight rib that was out in my upper back as well.   I have been seeing another local chiropractor that has been great but we just weren't quite getting there in terms of loosening those vertebrae up.   Dr. Troy is a big guy and pretty powerful, not to get confused with rough or aggressive. But it's exactly what my body needed to get that relief I desperately needed.  The first adjustment I was so locked up even Dr. Troy wasn't quite able to release it. So I came back for 2-3 more adjustments and by the end of the 3rd adjustment I was fully unlocked and able to sleep and move my head in full range of motion pain free.   Price is amazingly low for his services $25 (you can tip as well).  The appointments can be scheduled on line and you can be in and out in a matter of 10-15 minutes.   I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Troy if you need, desperately need some quick relief, even in my scenario where my primary chiropractor was unable to quite get me there.

I met a friend here for happy hour on a Friday right after work.   It is new, right next door to George and Dragon.  The patio faces central but has some really nice long wooden benches with cushions and small tables.   Inside has a great long bar area with table seating as well. Plus this open fireplace that they use for cooking the meats. We were watching as they cook this meat and let the juices drip onto whatever they were cooking underneath it.  Mouth watering!  I had the ramen noodle soup and a beer. The soup was amazing. They drop a egg in there with some pork and other goodies. On happy hour it's only like $5, come on that's awesome.   I'm definitely going to come back for more.

I don't have a dog.  But my parents do and I was dog sitting for them. So I brought their Chocolate Dobbie here. Walked him since I live close. The area is quite large.   There is a small dogs area for the little guys on the west side of the park. Fenced off.   Then there is a larger area for the big dogs.  No park police here, dog parks are kinda funny I kept thinking of a Portlandia episode while I was here. But everyone was pleasant and my dog ran and had a blast.   They have benches, water fountains for humans and dogs in each area.   Great place!

I actually live directly next to this place. I must also say I'm writing this review after the first day it has been open.  Yes, I went on Monday, the day they opened up shop.   For a while this little strip hasn't had much success with businesses. So for the people living in this area we were really excited to have a new restaurant/bar opening literally next to our apartments.   I ended up walking over and having the Margherita Pizza. One of my neighbors met me for drinks a little after dinner....This is on par if not better then Federal Pizza's Margherita Pizza (which is my favorite, until now).   Custom Brick Wood Oven!!!!!!  The owners are from Italy and speak Italian. VERY FRIENDLY. They have Tiramisu that is really fresh, they were nice enough to give me a slice on the house.   Variety of Italian beers around $4-5, everything very affordable! Cocktails, Wine, Coffee & Soda. They also have Bruschetta and Panini's as well.   Interior looks really great. I'm happy this is here and I wish them many years of success.
