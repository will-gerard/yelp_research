We went in 4:10 on a Sunday afternoon. There were people sitting at the bar and about 3 tables occupied outside. One couple inside who hadn't been served anything at the time we entered. Sign said to seat yourself. 5 waitresses walking around made eye contact but never came over, smiled, nothing to acknowledge our presence. Finally after about 10-15 minutes, someone came over. She got 2 menus when there were 3 of us. Took our drink order and came back with water, chips and salsa, and our drinks. My iced tea was without a lemon (a first for me) when I tried to get the waitress to come back she just kept walking. I have a pretty loud voice. Another 15 minutes of more waiting and I shouted to get the attention of a different apathetic waitress for her to get a manager. The manager came over and try to make it better but I had enough got up and left. Even if the food is good I'll never know because I won't go back due the crappiest service I've ever experienced.

I don't understand all the bad reviews. We had great service and the food was way better than Red Lobster. We will be back.

Squid Ink Sushi Bar.. WOW!! I have not been to a sushi bar like this in a while. The atmosphere is very pleasant and welcoming, much like the workers :) I have eaten there twice already and each time has been absolute satisfaction! My favorites are the cougar roll, the surf n turf roll, as well as the perfectly grilled teriyaki chicken. I noticed the most famous appetizers were the edamame, (which also can be ordered with garlic) and the chicken wings. Many people I talked to felt the same way as I did about this wonderful restaurant. Another cool thing is that they have 2 happy hours!! Normal happy hour is from 3pm-6pm and their reverse happy hour is from 10pm-12pm. They also have a double sided bar so you are welcome to sit inside or outside, and with the summer heat finally starting to die down, I think that is a very smart and original idea. Overall, Squid Ink Sushi Bar is and will be a big hit for a long time due to their helpful and kind employees, the AMAZING and versatile menu, and the warmth of the atmosphere :) Keep it up guys!!

Great service! Kimberly was our server and she was very knowledgeable of the menu. that was helpful since was our 1st visit. The food was flavorful and not the typical Sonoran-style Mexican many restaurants serve. Their prices were reasonable for the food you get. Even though the house margaritas are served in a Scotch glass, they packed a punch so a traditional margarita glass would've been too much. Desserts were original and delicious! We had a good time and we'll be back many times over!!
