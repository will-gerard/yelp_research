We love living here. Compared with other places, it's a good value for the cost. Wireless internet throughout the public areas, close to downtown, beautiful pool and entrance.  The staff have been responsive, repairing both emergent and nonemergent requests quickly. There's frequent restaurant meals, happy hours, holiday parties, and other promotions at little to no cost. We often use the pool, business center, front sitting area, and common living area. We have a huge home at our disposal for the price of rent. We would be spending many times the cost for all of this if we owned our own home with similar amenities and maintenance.

Taking a walk with out of town visitors to show them how downtown phoenix is coming alive ... And we walked into this little, fun, free museum. And we got our pic taken and emailed to us, in front of the stagecoach. Great memories.

There is nothing like a walk in massage ... A relaxing surprise. I love it that I didn't need an appointment.

My husband and I started initial paperwork in the event that we decided on an apartment at skyline (used to be Altavista). We had seen one apartment in which we had interest but we were clear that a decision was not made. We were told that if we decided on the apartment we could log on to the website and pay a non refundable $204, now that the initial paperwork was started. The next day we spent some time in the apartment to check for allergies since I don't usually do well with carpet. I reacted to the carpet so we decided against it.   What I discovered several days later were two withdrawals from our checking account for a total of $86 for our "application fee". This was never disclosed to us. We were told that we were "starting the paperwork to make it easier if we chose to apply". The fine print says after 24 hours the application fee is not refundable. What a scam. The verbal exchange did not match the fine print.   I'd give zero stars if I could.
