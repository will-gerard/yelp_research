If you come inside you think they must specialize in fancy street tacos or fajitas, but I am telling you that the absolute best thing on the menu is the Buttermilk Chicken. Fried Chicken, mashed sweet potatoes, and a pepper-y gravy. I would say that it tastes like Thanksgiving but I've never had anything that good on Thanksgiving before. That is the dish that keeps me coming back and back again.

They run low on Printer Paper. So even though you get a confirmation email, when you show up they don't have you or the 5 other people waiting for their To-Go orders. Don't worry they are making it now...
