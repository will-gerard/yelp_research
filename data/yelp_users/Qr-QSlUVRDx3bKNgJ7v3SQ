Without going into all the details lets just say the experience at Cafepino is underwhelming, the food is extremely under seasoned, the service/servers can be a little abrasive, and for what it is, in my opinion overpriced...especially when you are told one thing and get a bill for something else.  The one thing it has going for it is for the fairly good atmosphere.

When it comes to honesty, integrity, and overall knowledge, Babbitt Motor Werks is the only place to go for your BMW servicing needs.  Jen and Nathan are amazing and always look out for your best interest.  Unless your decision is purely based on the need of a loaner car I would highly recommend staying away from the dealer and giving Babbitt Motor Werks a try.  You won't be disappointed.
