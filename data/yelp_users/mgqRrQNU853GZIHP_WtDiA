They make a hellova Cuban! You won't be sad you ordered it! Service is good and fast enough for lunch on a work day.

We stopped in for a glass of wine. They had an amazing selection and a full bar. We did not have the chance to eat anything but have been planning our return trip. What a hidden gem, cannot wait to come back! The staff were very friendly as well and told us they have live music and dance on the weekends.

My family has been eating here for as long as I can remember! They have the best New Mexican food in the valley so far. The service is always great too. The combo plates are always a win and they have some super great lunch specials so you don't overdue it =) This is also home to one of  my favorite margaritas!

I was really disappointed with our experience here. We came in hoping to enjoy the music and a few drinks on a Saturday night and we will probably never come back. The lady taking money at the gate was about the most unwelcoming individual I have ever encountered. I don't mind paying a cover when the music is good but the band took 45 minute breaks and just never returned from the last "break".  We had a hefty tab for the few drinks we had and I wondered if the folks eating dinner paid a cover as well. At one point we heard a waitress tell the bartender she was wasted, and when my other half went to use the restroom the door was slammed in his face and he was told by the 5 idiots inside to take a hike. (have no clue what they were doing) There was someone in the office in the same hallway that didn't do anything about it because he was clearly distracted by the intoxicated woman that pushed her way into the office with him and closed the door. I had been here before and really had a great time, now it seems like a total dump. Sad. We will never waste money here again and I would suggest almost anywhere else if you are thinking about it.

The food here is really good and we had great service both times. Once during the day, order pork sliders and they were sooooo good. They also had Stoli on special for $4. =) The other time we were there was in the evening, it was chili and we were outside but they had a great fire place that kept our area really cozy. We split the pork chop dinner and it was great too. You have to try the creamed corn! (I try not to eat french fries but they are beyond awesome too LOL)

Always a great time! The band is really good here on weekends but be warned, if your not a crowd person then avoid the busy nights as its a small place. During the day they have a GREAT chili dog. There are other great sounding options but I can't order anything else lol

Thank goodness I found this place. I am terrified of going to the dentist and really needed to get my wisdom teeth pulled as they were all leaning. The staff was so amazing on the first and second visit for cleanings. Dr. Brittain did the extractions with help from yet another amazing staff member and I have got to tell you it was painless. Obviously you may feel some discomfort depending on the situation with your teeth but I didn't. I was so scared and they made me feel very at ease. I went back a week later for a filling and I will never go anywhere else as long as they are in business. Highly recommend this office to anyone.

You really cant beat this place. Its great for a nice meal with good table service or a late drink and small meal from the Bar menu. I don't think you could ever have bad service here either. Honestly if you gave it less than 5 stars for any reason, it was you....not Sal's. I recommend this place to all of my friends and family that visit from out of town. The spare ribs are probably may favorite dish so far. If I ever manage to order anything else I will be sure to update my review.  The food here is amazing.

My family has been eating here for 13 years. We come from New Mexico and our Mexican food is different. We love it here...almost like home. The patio is amazing for margaritas any time. They are half priced for happy hour :)

I have taken my car here numerous times and for a variety of reasons. These guys are about as honest as you can get and actually give a crap about customer service. I really appreciate that they always go out their way when my car issue is urgent and I wont go anywhere else. I recommend them to everyone, you will not be disappointed.

I love this place. I have been going here for a long time and have been getting my nails done long enough to know that one bad nail tech does not ruin the salon. Ask for a good one instead. I always go for Ten or Kim. They keep it very clean here, the Pedi is always great and they are always very nice. Really love this place. Also if you have time get your brows done =)

I don't even know where to begin. I cannot think of a single time this was the suggested destination and anyone in the group declined. They make some amazing food! I LOVE the chicken pesto pizza and if you still think your mom or wife makes the best lasagna its only because you have not eaten it here yet. (Sorry ladies, its true) I love sitting outside, having some wine and just enjoying the food with friends. Amazing wine collection, if I need  to hit the market to buy something I still cant resist a little helping of the antipasto salad. They also have really good desert but I rarely have room left to eat it. The staff is always great too. Please never close....ever.

I wish I could just rate the comedy. I cannot believe the price of the drinks in this place and what infuriated me the most was that they charged the gratuity automatically and then handed us our ticket in the dark and without saying anything about it let me then tip on top of that total. I think that is beyond rude. I would have left a decent tip any way because the service was fine. Just upsets me. I also think your two drink minimum is rude when you charge $8 for a soda. I had never been to a comedy club before and was really excited to go and the comedians were pretty funny but I wont be back. Over $300 after some drinks and a double tip. No thanks.

I really loved sitting on the Pet Smart Patio. The seats were comfortable and there felt like a lot of good space, not crowded. When you wanted to walk around it was very easy to get in and out and there are clean bathrooms really close. There is also a bar and LoLos Chicken and Waffles so if you dont like all you can eat hotdogs, you have other options.

My boyfriend brought me here for dinner on a Friday night. We did make a reservation and even though we had to change the time at the last minute they were very accommodating. We both drank Mai Tai's all night and loved our meals. He had the Mahi Special and I had the Salmon. Both were very good, I cant wait to come here again! Bonus....the store is downstairs and I got a dress on sale with an additional discount for dining upstairs. I wish I could remember our servers name...there were 3 people taking care of us.  I would suggest the coconut shrimp as an app!

I really wanted to love this place. The unfortunate truth is no matter how good the food is or how amazing the drinks are, if the service sucks the experience is bad. When we arrived they were pretty busy, it was a Friday night around 8:30. I could see open tables all over so I was relieved. We stood at the door next to the please wait to be seated sign for almost 15 minutes before being greeted from across the room by someone a waiter finally flagged. We were seated and greeted quickly by a friendly lady that gave us menus and left to get us water. We started to read the menu when another waitress came over and also asked for a drink order. We told her someone was already taking care of us and she said "I will be your server, let me go talk to her because I know exactly who it was!" We were just kind of agreeable. Well about another 10 min. Pass and server number 2 comes walking over with our water. We ordered a coconut martini and a mule. We also placed an order for the chicken dish and some wings. I don't know how long we waited for those drinks but we sat there talking and finished an entire glass of water and half of a refill (courtesy of the waiter for the table next to ours) when they arrived and our food was delivered by someone else moments later. The food was pretty good but the order was wrong and since our waitress never came back to check and didn't bring it out herself, we never got it fixed. After we finished eating my other half ordered another drink. I was hoping we could just go somewhere else and not wait 20 minutes for a $15 drink but it was too late lol. She had brought the tab when he ordered it so something told me we would never see her again. We could see his drink sitting on the bar....waiting. Not kidding, 20 minutes later she brought it over. The entire meal would have been different if we could have just kept our first waitress. I don't mind spending money on a great meal and some drinks but I refuse to pay for awful service. We won't be back.

Can't go wrong with brunch here. We sit at the bar and have always had really great service. I love the BLT and my other half gets the Lox and Bagel plate every time. He loves it. They also do a build your own mimosa and bloody Mary bar.

A friend and I came here today because she knows I am always looking for a good New Mexico Mexican place to eat. We split the Carne Adovada and the Chili Relleno platter. They were both so good! I want to come back for breakfast because that also looked amazing!

This place is great! The food is awesome, I recommend that you try white pizza and a pasta dish. The service is always good and they have draft beer! They have to big TVs so we like to go here to watch a game without the bar noise.

This place will win you over on smell alone. The white pizza was amazing and they have some great specials. My Gal Pals like the pasta special on Tuesdays, they end up with dinner from the left overs. I honestly cant wait to try everything on the menu! The staff has been really great each time too. One last thing...GARLIC KNOTS. =)

I wish I had a better review. I was pretty excited to get to experience the spa at the Biltmore but it fell far below expectations for me. My other half and I booked a couples massage over a weekend stay with a few additional treatments. We were hoping to relax and enjoy the day but outside of the actual massage it was a huge let down. The steam room in the Women's locker room was out of order leaving the sauna so full of people I could not get a seat. The relaxation room was very outdated and not really conducive to relaxing. There was some random pretzel sticks and water in a very bright room. Its set up like the waiting room in a doctor's office. For over $800 bucks I was disappointed to say the least. The massage alone would have had a 5 star rating but the experience as a whole was enough to deter me for good.

This is the best dive bar in the valley. Its a small place so seating is limited and it can get pretty busy on holidays and such. The owner and all of the employees are great and the drinks are cheap. Its a great spot! Everyone is welcome here but douchebaggery will get you nowhere fast.They don't serve food but you can walk across the street and grab something and come back and they have a pool table. They also have a juke box that has anything and everything you can think of =)

We stopped in for a few drinks while we waited for our room to be ready. The cocktails were amazing but very pricey. I had the strawberry infused one and my sister had what was called a chucumber. I didn't like hers but she did, mine however was amazing! We did not try the food but the service at the bar was amazing. Great atmosphere.

They have really good comfort food at a very comfortable price! On the weekend this place will be slammed and anytime there is a baseball game beware. Even when its busy the service is really good and the food is always amazing. The pancakes are crispy on the edges =) Definitely try hash brown casserole. When I don't want breakfast I cannot resist the chicken and dumplings.

My boyfriend and I wondered over here at about 10 am on a Sunday. We were greeted not with a hello but a very rude "We have no prime rib and no crab legs!" We had never been here so we didn't know that was the normal menu. We said that would be fine we were just really hungry. After listening to the cashier bash one of the employees standing near the door and paying almost $40.00 for the two of us to get breakfast we were taken to our table. We both went and grabbed a plate and headed back. Not only was everything on my plate cold (ham, pork, some kind of breakfast sausage) but we didn't get a drink until we asked for a waiter after 20 minutes! The staff were all gathered near the drink station talking. We ate maybe 2 bites of our food and decided since it was cold we didn't want to be sick and left. We will never eat here again!!!!  **Update- This business did reach out to me after reading my review and have extended an invitation to try it again which I think is very cool. I have not had a chance to take them up on their offer but I think it says good things about management.

My boyfriend decided to take me here on over the weekend. We managed to snag a pair of seats at the bar. I have to say this place had a really neat atmosphere and they had some live music going on. We had a few glasses of great wine and really great service from our two bartenders. We ended up ordering the chefs board, half a spinach salad and the Mahi-Mahi special. The board had a great selection, loved the tomatoes with the goat cheese and I have been craving that spinach salad since we left! The special was really good too, good combination of flavors. I cannot wait to go back here.

I have been going here for about 6 months now. I LOVE Marie, she is always so sweet and super positive. Dr. Bird is great too, he went out of his way to explain things to me and I have lost almost 30 pounds! I am eating better than I ever have before, I am moving more and I feel amazing. I am very grateful that I found this place. =)

We came here after the Cubs game on a Saturday night. The band was incredible and very high energy. We didnt have any issues getting our drinks even though the place was packed, but we had seats right at the bar. We got lucky. Cant wait to come here again with friends. The only warning is the deinks are not very cheap....to be expected from this type of place in its location. (We paid 10 bucks a pop for vodka sodas with titos) Very fun time!

I have dreams when I am out of town about the Cuban here...I realize how ridiculous that sounds but I literally crave it. The service here has always been top notch and they have great drinks. You really do have to try it once and then you will be like the rest of us.....5 pounds heavier because you keep coming back! The burgers are amazing too, cooked to perfection.

Not bad :) stopped here for lunch during the work week and had really good service. I had the rellano plate, someone else ordered the burrito bowl and the third had tacos. Everyone liked the food and the chips and salsa were good. My only complaint is that my rellano oozed grease when I cut it open. Needed to drain or something before it was placed on the plate.

This place never disappoints! We like to sit at the bar but there are no bad seats in the place. The food has always been very good, you have to try the deep south hot dog. Its my favorite =) They have a great drink menu (recommend the cherry squirt) and tons of beer on tap. Its a must for all Blackhawks games!

I was so happy to stumble upon this little book store today with a friend! They had a fantastic selection of classical lit. They also make it very easy to browse through their other categories. I wish I had gotten her name but there was a very friendly girl to offer a hello and some assistance with a smile on her face. I am in love, punch card started =)

I enjoyed a meal here on a Saturday July 2 in the afternoon with 2 other adults and a 5 year old. The mixed drinks are really good, they have some good shine flavors. We shared a HUGE plate of nachos covered in brisket hash. Our table also ordered the wedge salad, 2 French dips and the kids cheeseburger. No complaints on those. The French dips came with this really good horse radish sauce. I did get a side of brisket for $6 that was kind of dry but the flavor was great. I will definitely be back. I wish I could remember our server's name, he was a young, charming guy that watched our table really well. We never had empty drinks and he inquired about the food when we got it and after we had a chance to eat it. Very good service.
