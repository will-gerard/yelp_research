Fast and friendly service - not to mention the absolutely adorable decor! As a first time customer I booked my appointment with Elaine. Elaine was very kind, friendly and made me feel comfortable. I was in and out in about 10 minutes; and the price range is VERY reasonable. I will definitely be returning.

My family and I enjoy dining at Pita Jungle for their reverse happy hour (from 9pm to close). We especially like the grilled lemon chicken, hummus, and tomato and mozzarella platter. Last week we stopped in for a late dinner and it took any single server about 15 minutes to come greet us. Many staff members looked at us, and saw that we had not been helped (we did not even have menus) but keep walking. My family loves this location because it is very convenient and the food is always on point (my favorite dish is the macro platter). We are both shocked and upset at the lack of customer service we received during our last visit.

A GREAT option for healthy food on the go. I especially like the acai bowls that are filled with fruit and granola. Decent sized portions for the pricing, friendly staff, and a very clean environment. I would recommend Nekter to anyone wanting a taste of healthy living!
