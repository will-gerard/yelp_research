I must agree with many of the previous comments. I was raised in Europe so I'm very familiar with German food ....this restaurant would never make it in Germany. Every meal we had at our table and it was very dry, overcooked and not tasty at all , the dumplings were not completely cooked the mashed potatoes tasted like out of the box. The decor is german, if you go to typical German restaurants, if looks like this, it's not a hipster restaurant and I didn't expect it to be. The bread was frozen bread, the soup tasted like out of a can. I can personally cook a German meal 10 fold better than they did. Even if it had been good, it was way overpriced. Sorry, Ill never go back, recommend you try somewhere else.

Beautiful hotel, for sure, but their new policy for parking is really cheap. I live in phoenix and have been coming for cocktails and/or dinner to the resort for 25 years, $10 for 2 hours valet, $ 3 for 2 hours  for self parking, what do think this is Manhattan??? Just a way to suck every last cent out of your customers. This used to be a classy hotel, but the stupid decisions of management really ruins the experience. Time to change to other resorts in town that have still kept their class. Really bad!

Great new chef as of October 1st, 2015, no comparison to George! The food now tastes like a 1st class french restaurant not like before. The new Chef comes from a line of famous french michelin rated restaurants apparently, and you can taste the difference!!! This must have been the best french meal I have ever had and I lived in europe for 16 years. Highly recommend it! You will not be disappointed.
