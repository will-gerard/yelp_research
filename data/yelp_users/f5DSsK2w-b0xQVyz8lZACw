It's Costco in Scottsdale. What can you say. Nice selection, fast check outs and a hell of a booze section.

This is a regular hang out - I have to see a show here at least once a month. On 7/3 I made the trip down to see Phoenix Legend Hans Olson perform with a full band for his annual birthday bash. Great show. In all of the years i have been coming here I can't think of a bad show. Oh sure there were bad times, fighting with my spouse, car issues, drank too much/not enough but the bands have ALWAYS been solid. You can count on the Music, great service from Lynsay and the place to be a dump. Love it. Free parking. Couple of tips. Sometimes you will find a food truck there. Check the web site before you come down if you are hungry. Sit in front of the little wall/bar and the acoustics are much much better.

Been there a ton of times over the past 30 years. Same great burgers and fries, people, choice of bud and bud lite...  Its a dive. Great place to go for lunch but maybe not the best place to impress the ladies. 8)

Great neighborhood dive bar. Live music everynight. Thursdays are Rockabilly. Usually very good bands and great dancers. The owner, Tumbleweed is a very cool guy - all of the bands love him and all the help he gives the bands. The bar staff is fun and efficient.

Great small venue. Cheap beer, live music, pretty girl's and a nice patio.  Get there early for big shows so you can be on the side of the bar where the stage is. The acoustics are much better. If you are there for the music...

Outstanding fun! Fast cars and very competitive. Had a couple bump and runs and no warnings etc. Really enjoyed it.  I did not eat but the people with me approved of it. 2 drink maximum before driving.

When I fist walked in with my gransfson on a Saturday afternoon I thought no way am I doing this. The place was packed. We went I n any way and had a blast. The 10 year old became a leader and I a lowly foot soldier.  Good time reasonable priced. The staff was very friendly and the food was better than I expected.

Like the rest of the Buffoons in this company, the store did nothing that the techs I spoke to the night before to told me to make sure happened. They pointed out a mac address and told me it was the password to access the modem. They had no idea what to do with me when I brought my modem in for an exchange. Took a long time to convince them I was not canceling. Been with Cox 21 years and they charged me $50. for an install when I moved. I know, 21 years with no other options for service.   The installer cut the direct TV cables because it was easier and faster to for him to install. I assume I now have to pay for DirectV to install. Installer left about 15 feet of cable hanging out of the wall (not the room the modem is in) and ran the cable under the outlet cover rather than feeding the cable through. That would have required a new fitting.   Overall, if you have any possible option to go with other than Cox do it. Really.

I have been buying from Discount for 20 years and cant even imagine going anywhere else. This store is within blocks of another Discount Tire but I go here because it seems to be less crowded.

Discussed everything with me and all the employees were pleasant. The up sell was not hard core just a lot of items to upsell. Bought into the high milage oil and new wiper blades. They check air pressure all fluids etc.

I scheduled an appointment for a physical for 9:45 am Friday June 29. 2012. I arrived 15 minutes early to complete all documentation including payment of my co-pay. I was required to sign a document stating I would be charged $25.00 if I missed an appointment and did not give your office a 24 hour notice.  After 45 minutes, at 10:30 am I realized that no Dr. nor Physician Assistant was going to show up. I walked out of the holding room and received a reversal on my credit card of my co-pay.   If you do not have any respect for my time, how could I think that you would have any respect for my health?

As a follow up to the Doctor letting me sit in a exam room and never showing up, I  called and sent a letter requesting $25.00 to be paid to me for wasting my time. Just like the document I had to sign saying I would pay them $25.00 if I did not give a 24 hour notice.   Guess what they have not called or written.  IT IS VERY CLEAR THESE PEOPLE  DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS.  Scottsdale Family & Urgent Care 9767 N 91st Street Scottsdale, AZ 85258

This is a first for me. I tried to return a tool that failed. I was told my receipt expired.   I explained the tool died the day I bought it but it is hot out and I have not been doing much in my workshop. I was told there was nothing they could/ would do about it.   I advised them to throw the tool away and that they lost a long time customer. By the way the tool was a arrow rivet gun. Total value with tax is $21.00   As a homeowner in the neighbor hood this costs them potentially tens of thousands of dollars over my life time.  I will drive the extra mile and go to another home building center.

Just for the record, It has been almost 30 days since Home Depot publicly said they would "look into it". Not a peep.  I have since out of habit pulled into the parking lot twice and once even got almost to the door before I realized what I was doing. I got back in the car and went to Ace Hardware once and to Lowes the other time. Not a lot of money about $100.  Bathroom cabinet, sink, counter top, toilet etc. In September. Just not from Home Depot.

This the second time I have been to this place for a maintance issue. Two seperate cars. They have been great about doing a full "once over" and then reccomending things that should be done and a time line. For example, I had an oil change on a high milage car and there was a seal with a slight leak. They did not suggest that I pay to have it replaced the but recommend I do replace it over the next couple oil changea. Very refreshing to not have scare tactics used. I now refer my sisters here.

Living in Scottsdale there are endless choices of where to get food from. Chili's has a nice menu and reasonable prices. I always order online togo food. They are good about the time estimates and they usually do a good job of quality control to make sure you get what you order.   Last time I ordered I was missing 1/2 of the bun on a bacon cheese burger. It was a major/stuck to the paper mess.   Over all Chilis is an ok deal and very convenient if you like to order online and not have to get out of your car to pick up food.

I have driven from Scottsdale to Apache Junction on many occasions to be treated by Dr. Bigler. I have introduced my wife, 2 adult children and my grandson to this practice..   My grandson (8) has this thing against dentists. 3 X he has refused to let other Dentists work on him. (I loved paying those bills!)   Dr. Bigler comforted him, got him to open up and even use a needle.  I can not say enough about what a fantastic dental practice this is. It is worth the 40 minute drive!

Through the years, I have purchased many things including a wedding ring for my wife from The Jewelsmith. This is not your typical jewelry store. This is the place to go when you want something special. You do not have to buy a big diamond here. They have custom pieces new, used and estate jewelry.  What I really love about the Jewelsmith is that the owners give back so much to the community.

I have been shopping at the Jewelsmith for many years. The place is amazing. If you are expecting some big chain store, don't. These are real people that have been in the business for a long, long time. They have everything from estate jewelry to custom jewelry. They repair watches and jewelry. Sue, Bridget and Tilly are fantastic to work with.

Hot chicks and stiff drinks. An outside bar where you can smoke. What could be bad about this?   The service sucks.   For the second time in 3 weeks I went in with a buddy and could not get anyone to serve us. We flagged one one of the many waitresses and asked for a menu. We never were asked for an order. For the 2 beers we did get we had to go to the bar and get them our selves.   Sunday morning I talked to a friend who had been in Wednesday night and got the same type of treatment. This place does not deserve your business, especially at $6. a pint.

Write a review about an oil change place? Yup. Met the owner. Nice guy. He was helping a guy who spoke no English but his car had broken down a few blocks away. Helped him, without charging him for a tow. My experience was a clean place, friendly people and reasonable price. The owner even took me on a tour and showed off the state of the art wheel alignment equipment he just purchased. I will go back and be comfortable that they are NOT trying to rip me off. I was impressed with the pride, effort, honesty, cleanliness and pricing.

I have had At Your Door install hitches and trailer brakes on my last 3-4 vehicles and they have always done an outstanding job. I had an issue once that I called them about and they did a trouble shooting session with me. (user error) Saved me a service call. I recommend At Your Door Mobile Hitches without hesitation.

I had a new operating system installed on a old laptop that was destined for the trash. Mike (manager and co-founder) suggested an older version of Ubuntu be installed.  I picked the computer up the next day and he took the time to go over the basics and show me that it was working properly. Mike even gave me $50.00 off coupon that he applied to my bill.  These guys are fantastic and a locally owned and operated company. The sell computers and service them. Don't waste your time, money and energy bringing your computers for repairs to Best Buy, Geek Squad etc when you can get it done right at a reasonable price and keep the tax dollars right here in your own neighborhood.

I purchased a GE Dishwasher from Spencers TV and Appliance in Scottsdale in December of 2005.      I have had repair technicians out from Goldwing Appliance three times and have to call again. This time for a alarm clock sounding buzz.      I was sold this unit for $600. plus a 6 year warranty for a total of $855.57. I don't think that is a cheap dishwasher. I bought it because the salesman, Tony L. advised me that it has a bigger motor and larger holes in the water distribution system resulting in less scraping and cleaner dishes. That made sense to us.      The first time I had a repair tech out it was because the dishes do not get clean. We were advised to buy the "pellets" soap at Costco and to increase the water temperature. The next time a tech came out it was because the dishwasher would not drain. The technition opened the bottom of the dishwasher and cleaned it out. He advised us that the problem was that we bought a cheap dishwasher and that we should have sprung for the Bosch. He also advised uds to quit using thre "pellet" soap as the dishwasher is not powerful enough to break it down so some grains stick to the dishes. We were also put on a cup of vinegar each month on a empty wash cycle to help the machine wash the soap from it's system.      Next the dishwasher started flooding my kitchen. This happened repeatedly. When the tech showed up I was advised that there was a problem with the drain valve and rather than replace it the tech removed the quiet guard and left it under my sink. When asked about it he said that if it flooded again to call them again and they would come out and try something else. He also advised me that a cheap dishwasher like this was loud anyway so I would not notice the sound difference.      A few days later I called the Scottsdale Spencers TV & Appliance and asked for the manager. I believe his name was Tony. He listened to my story and advised me that he would call me back the next day and that he would have the manager of Goldwing Appliance Factory Service call me.      That was about 60 days ago and I have yet t hear back from anyone.      My dishwasher is again in need of repair.      Each time the repair person from Goldwing Appliance (owned by Spencers) have said the problem was caused by buying a cheap dishwasher and that we should have bought the Bosh.      I can not tell you how disappointed I am in all three of these businesses. Spencers TV & Appliance in Scottsdale, Goldwing Appliance Factory Service and General Electric.      Make no mistake, I will buy Bosh next time but it will be from another retailer. I just wish I could have gotten more than 2 1/2 years out of this poorly constructed product and some real service out of a 6 year extended warranty.      Buyer Beware!

I ordered my custom made door and it arrived recently for installation. The design was exactly to specifications, quality of construction and the finish are flawless. It took several months to get but it was worth it. This one improvement has increased the value of my home and makes my entire family feel safer.

I have been in a couple of barter groups through the years and by far this is the best one. I use barter mostly for entertaining clients and prospects. I also use barter for the tools to grow my business when ever I can. From answering service to printer to accountant. I love it. Having said that you have to understand that some businesses are not as honest as others. This is true in the COC, BBB and any group. You as a member have to shop. You will find members from time to time who can't take on more trade and some who will raise prices for barter. (Not Cool!)  Sometimes it helps to talk to the owner about the service before you tell they you are dealing in barter. If the price goes up, walk away and report them. You have to be creative in how you use barter. Think out side the box and try use barter first. It also helps if you can be flexible in delivery dates etc to allow the businesses to "fill in" their slow times with barter.

I spent the afternoon watching football games and eating the Sunday afternoon BBQ special - all you can eat from 3-7. Met with the manager, Woo and learned about the place. Great foot, tons of beers Local and national. They are very involved with the community. The food was above average and the beer selection was outstanding. For Scottsdale, $5. pint is very reasonable and $9, pitchers. Shea the server mentioned they have dog biscuits. I brought one home and my dog went nuts. He loved it. I will be back, this time with my dog!

Apparently this place does not want to deal with individuals. Couldn't get around to looking at my pool vac while I was there and would not sell me the chemicals for my pool. Pr10000. They would only sell this to commercial accounts. Move on to someone who wants your business.

My wife's car had very noisy brakes. I assumed I would need brake pads and roters. Charlie and team checked them out, cleaned them up and advised me I did not need to replace any parts. No charge. It is this type of fast, honest service that will keep me coming back over and over.

Went in for a quick happy hour meeting with a co-worker at his suggestion. I was surprised to see the taps.... some of my favorite styles of beer, if not brewers that I recognize. Paul the bartender led me to a saison to start the session. My friend ordered food, I swore I did not have time but ended up getting some anyway.  I smoke meats and fish at home and think I am pretty damn good at it but this place was out of this world. I will be back again and again. Excellent vibe, great bartender and fantastic food.

This place is close to my house and very convenient. I am glad because I am a Vaping fiend. Prices are good and the selection is excellent. I have become friends with several of the employees and it seems like Rob is the one that's always there. Incredibly helpful and always a joy to be around. If you are in the scottsdale area it is worth stopping in. If for no other reason, just to see who a well run vape shop should be run.

I bought my grandson a Galaxy S6 for Christmas. I spent about $75 on a case for the phone. He dropped it once, and the case cracked. Since then the case has continued to come apart. Today I went into the store and wanted to replace it thinking there would be no issue since it would be under warranty. Of course the store told me that they could not replace it but I could go home and send it into the manufacturer for a warranty. However they did offer me 20% off on buying a new case. Keep in mind I spend about $550 per month for my account. This is totally unacceptable and I believe it's time to move all of my business accounts from them. Thank you so much Verizon.

I brought my motorcycle tank to Spooky after shopping around. The quoted price was at least $100. less than anyone else I talked to. When I got to the the shop I was very happy to see it is a big, new, professional shop. Matt, the front counter guy gave me a tour of the facility. I wish my garage (or bedroom for that matter) was as clean as this shop is. They have several bikes on display and fully manufacture many parts on location. Anyway, back to my experience. Matt quoted me a price and told me a date that the work would be completed. The day before it was scheduled to be done he called and let me know it was ready. The Guys at spooky not only painted my tank and perfectly color matched the factory paint but they also painted my front fender. This was an amazing experience and was done exactly the way business should be done. Thanks to Matt and the experts at Spooky.

After living in my house for about 15 years I finally elected to have the ducts cleaned. I chose Abracadabra after talking to the owner Jeremy as he seemed to know what he was doing. He and an employee showed up on time (nice start). The then pulled out a bunch of hoses, and a brush that they ran through the vents. This contraption was hooked up to a "super sucker" mounted in the van. This was a messy job.  They did an excellent job on my vents at a reasonable price and they cleaned up after themselves.  I highly recommend Abracadabra Carpet Cleaners and will be calling them back to clean the grout on my floors.
