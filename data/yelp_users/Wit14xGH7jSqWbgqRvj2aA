I often work at this venue, parking for event staff is $4 and can be a bit of a walk. It's spacious and lots of places to wonder around in between sessions. Power stations to charge your handheld devices and clean bathrooms, the food joints are a bit pricey so I would venture to one of the many surround eateries.

This place is a rip off, I've never smoked a cigarette in my life and I was charged for smoking in the room. I really wish I had taken pictures of the room before I settled because there were beer bottle caps in the draws(from previous guests) hair in the bath, and towels that were a different shade of white. I'm not the type to complain about small stuff considering I always bring my own towels, blankets and and other supplies I may need, next time I won't be such a nice and easy going person

This place is ghetto assf#*k! There are methers, prostitutes and scum that frequent this place, they do offer a AAA discount that brings the total to around $50 after tax. If you need a place to stay this will do, just don't leave your valuables in your vehicle.  Good luck

Well I came here to see some flair or personality, must have picked the wrong day. The place is empty and the guy(bartender) seemed smug and a little pretentious. Didn't even know 3 drinks we asked for so I ordered a beer.   Where are the little people???  I'm left with that bitter aftertaste that Scottsdale is good at leaving you with.

Stopped by this morning to reup on my pre workout juice.... Love the "BULLNOX" nice level of energy and focus with a dose of testosterone to give that extra drive.

This is no longer a 24 hour fitness, if you originated your membership in Arizona then you can transfer over to LA fitness. If you are from out of state and use Arizona locations then you are SOL! Let's get ready for membership prices to increase and locations to be shut down.  Thanks for the complications

Must try the homemade pop tart.  Arizona needs to get on the Hemp milk craze! Seattle knows about it, Los Angeles is getting there, now Phoenix needs to learn.

This is by far the worst storage facility I've ever rented from, not to even mention the corporate side of things. In late December of 2014 the unit I had been renting for about a year was broken into, it was a 10' x 20' unit full of everything I own. They took everything, leaving broken glass and shattered remains of my life. When I came to realize this has happened I filed a police report and reached out to the facility. This is when a business should take action to make the customer feel as if they are being looked out for, this was not the case for me And PUBLIC STORAGE, the talked down to me as if I don't matter, they kept telling me to file a police report, make an insurance claim... I was not seeking counsel or advice from them, I was asking for a discount our a little credit to help me out financially till I could relocate what little was left in the unit. They answer back that credit or anything is against their policy and NO help can be given.  Maybe I'm in the wrong but in my opinion they failed to provide a safe place to keep my personal belongings, and then treated me like I don't matter.  So please consider this before you take your business to this corporation.   Extra Space Storage will treat you like a human being and never screw you over like PUBLIC STORAGE did to me and many others.
