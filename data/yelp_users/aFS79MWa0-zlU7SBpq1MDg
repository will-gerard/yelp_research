They do fast work, call you back when they say they will and did a great job. Very friendly in there, too. Very personable.

Only giving it one star because the gals who work in the office were very sweet and tried to be helpful.  Having just moved here I needed a new place and thought I would give them a try.  My first thought as I walk into the lobby is it doesn't seem very professionally set up.  Seems cheaply decorated and it smells really weird...almost gross. I had a hard time with my stomach. It was later explained to me that it was the lens cutting smell. They tried Febreze but that just made it worse. I ended up going outside for fresh air.     I had a 2:00 appointment. A man walked in after me and said he didn't have an appointment but he had been a patient for five years and had been recovering from eye surgery and needed a new prescription...they took him in before me. This didn't make me very happy, but --- along with the unprofessional vibe, the smell and being backed up - I stayed.  Then I was called into the exam room. As I'm talking with the tech about what I'm looking for and she is getting ready to start some tests the doctor came in and told me I needed to move over. Didn't introduce himself and wasn't very friendly about it.  The tech let him know I wasn't who he thought I was and he said "you need to move her out of here" and when she tried to move me to a particular room he very rudely said "I said you need to move her out there!"  I thought, poor girl - this doctor is a jerk.  So she sets me in a hallway and he brought a different patient into that room.  I sat in the hallway and looked around and saw that the walls and counters and stuff were just awkward and out of place - it felt run down and not clean.    They brought me back to the room and as I'm sitting there I see that there's a part of the counter that is missing.  It doesn't feel clean, sanitary, organized...it just has an uncomfortable feel and by this time I've decided I don't want to go through with the exam and tell the tech.  She thought it was her fault and I explained that it's not her, she just works there, it's the environment...it doesn't feel right and I want to leave. She told me to wait there and she would bring in the manager and I told her that talking to someone else wasn't going to change how I felt about the condition of the place or make me more comfortable...but she left me sitting there anyway.  After about 30 seconds when they hadn't returned I just got up and left.  I feel bad,  But, there was no way I wanted to waste any more of my time or any of my money there.

AWFUL!!! We would never use them again. They didn't show up when they said they would, they did a crappy job when they did show up. My husband had to finally try and do some of the work himself.  Being new to the New River area we were relying on them to direct us to doing whatever we needed to do...they ended up selling us $5,000 worth of a second tank that we never really needed. They didn't return phone calls but had no problem calling us to get the rest of their money.  Once they were paid in full they never returned phone calls to them to fix something they didn't do right in the first place.  These people shouldn't even be in business.

Tried to have lunch here AT NOON - they were practically empty but told us it would be a 15 minute wait because they just got a party of 22 and didn't have enough servers. First of all, it's LUNCH TIME why don't you have enough servers for 22 guests? They gave us the option of sitting at the bar for faster service. We were THE ONLY people at the bar. There were THREE servers standing around at the bar watching ONE person make A SINGLE DRINK for over 8 minutes. NONE OF THE THREE even so much as said "hello" - no one said they'd be with us in a minute. Nothing. We were literally ignored the entire time. Needless to say we left and will not be back. We understand busy. We understand lunch time. This place was like a ghost town and no one could even acknowledge us.

I actually love this store - the items are unique and it's really a fun place to explore.  However - you would think that when a person is spending $3000 in a place they would let you use the restroom!!! Nope - they refuse to allow me to use the rest room and made me go across the street to use it at a restaurant.  HOW RUDE is that?  I have not gone back since then.

RUDE!!!! I didn't bother to even set an appointment because the person who answered the telephone sounded like she was completely put out having to answer the phone.  When I told her what I thought of her phone etiquette she said "Sorry!" and hung up on me.  Yeaaaah, that's the way to boost your business in a slumping economy!  No thanks!

Having just moved to New River I was in search of a good hair salon and found DollyRockers on Yelp! had quite a few positive reviews so I thought I would give it a try.  They got me in right away with Tracy.  Seriously...my hair has never looked better! I thought for sure it was a lost cause from all the coloring and I would have to get it cut short but she trimmed it up, conditioned the heck out of it, fixed the color - and I just can't believe how awesome it looks!

I was so excited to find this location near my work. Love the Classic Salad with Chicken. Within 3 visits the layout changed. Now you have to stand in line and at some point you will have access to a hand-held menu. Very awkward - why not just menu boards like before?  Now you can't just go through stations and get what you want or need. You have to go out of your way to ask for and wait for butter ??? Lemons for tea ???  The whole restaurant now seems chaotic and disorganized and I hate going there.  Seems like the prelude to going out of business to me.

One of my most favorite stores in Cave Creek.  We have purchased a number of items from them and have had nothing but great service and have always been happy with the quality of our pieces.  They go out of their way to accommodate our special requests for specific colors, etc. and will special order anything we can't find in the store.  I saw someone complained about them missing deadlines for delivery, etc. but we haven't had that experience and I hope they will give this store another chance because like i said, we've been there probably a dozen times in the past year and we have never had a bad experience.
