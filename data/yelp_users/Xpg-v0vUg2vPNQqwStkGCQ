If I could give zero stars I would.  I went in for a gel manicure and pedicure. The ambiance is horrible. Very depressing. It was dirty.  The woman that did my pedicure had me soak my hands in acetone to remove the gel that was already on my nails. She put the bowl of acetone on my lap and had me soak my nails while she did the pedi. I didn't like that because if it spilled my clothes would be ruined. About 10 minutes in to the pedicure she handed me a tool and told me to start scraping the gel off my nails!  Um I could do that at home if I wanted to do it myself. I'm here because I want someone else to do it. At this point I was really annoyed. The pedicure was painful. The polish job looked like a 10 year old did it. I decided to pass on the gel manicure because I knew I wouldn't be happy with it based on the pedicure. No drying lamps. Told me to stand in front of a fan while the polish dried. They didn't even have the squishy things that go between your toes so that the polish doesn't smudge while its drying.  To top things off I was charged extra for the gel removal that I did myself!  Horrible. Gross. Never again.

Turns out I caught athletes foot from this salon.  No joke. Reported to state board of cosmology today.

Tina does a great job on gel manicures.  She is five stars.  I'm giving an overall four stars to the salon because the other person that did my nails wasn't as good.  She was more like three stars...so I'm averaging the rating to four.

My husband and I eat here about one time per week.  I love their salads and this location never has a wait.  The butter cake is awesome.

Went in to look at a matching wedding band for my Tacori engagement ring.  The man that helped us was nice while we were in the store and was going to reach out to Tacori regarding a few questions we had.  He honestly wasnt overly knowledgeable about the brand, which was fine since he was willing to contact Tacori directly.  We never heard from him so we bought the Tacori wedding ring elsewhere.  I don't know why he didn't call us...I can't imagine him thinking we were not serious given I already have a Tacori engagement ring with a diamond that is well over 2 carats.  Oh well.  Their loss.  On another note, I've had my ring cleaned in their store and the designer specifically says that their rings are NEVER to be placed in Sonicare.  When I mentioned this to the sales person he had no idea.  So much for authorized retailer.

I've been a member of 24 Hour Fitness for a little over 4 years.  I go to the Camelback location 6 days a week.  The club changed management sometime last fall and I've seen a noticeable improvement.  Machines still break frequently, but they are usually repaired in a timely fashion.  If I notice something is broken, I just let the front desk know and they are very helpful.  I used to see so many "out of order" signs on the cardio equipment and I'm seeing less and less nowadays.  The bathrooms leave something to be desired.  There have been long-standing issues with backed up sinks and broken toilets in the women's restroom.  I've had my locker broken in to twice (once in Oct 2011 and once in May 2013) so now I just change at work and keep my bag with me rather than leaving it in a locker.  Management is aware of the theft problems, as they have hired security to patrol the parking lot and installed cameras.  It seems they are doing everything they can since obviously installing cameras in the locker rooms isn't an option.  I think theft is an issue in most gym locker rooms, so this isn't unique to 24 Hour Fitness or the Camelback location.  I can't complain at all about the staff.  Everyone is very nice and more than willing to help you.  Some of them even take the time to learn your name.  I wish I could remember some of their names so I could give them credit on yelp.  Anyway...overall, I would recommend 24 Hour Fitness if you're looking for a no frills gym.

You can tell that Dr. Gibson genuinely cares for animals. She is very honest and does not try to do unnecessary treatment in order to increase your bill. She is knowledgable and takes the time to answer all your questions rather than rushing through the appointment.  Five stars.

I brought my cat Fern in because she was having trouble going to the bathroom.  Initially I thought she was constipated.  We just moved to the neighborhood, so I had never been to Alta Vista Animal Hospital before. I called first thing in the morning and they were able to get me in for a 9:30 appointment, which was great.  The first vet we saw was Dr. Hendrix.  He recommended doing some x-rays and a urine analysis, which of course I agreed to.  The x-rays showed she was not constipated but her bladder was enlarged so he thought she may have a urinary tract issue.  Dr. Hendrix was very kind to Fern and took the time to show me her x-rays and explain everything.  We couldn't be sure until the results of the urine analysis came back the next morning and he said to bring her back if things get worse.  So I brought Fern home and per the doctor's recommendation, I kept her separate from my other cats so I could confirm how much urine she was eliminating.  When I brought her in, I told Dr. Hendrix that I thought she was peeing.  Turns out I was wrong.  After several hours, I noticed that she actually was not going to the bathroom at all.  No pee was coming out and she was becoming increasingly more uncomfortable.    At 9:50 PM that same day I called Alta Vista to see if I could bring her back since she was worse.  They actually close at 10:00 but since I live so close the receptionist said to come in, which was very nice since they didn't have to stay late to help me.  When we arrived she was seen by Dr. Ballard.  This is where the story gets interesting.  I found Fern three and a half years ago.  When I found her I took her to another vet and was told she was a female.  They attempted to spay her and found no uterus so the vet said she was already spayed.  Dr. Ballard discovered that Fern is actually a boy!  This is important because male cats can get complete blockages in their urinary tract and female cats generally do not.  Fern was blocked which made this a life or death situation.  He was admitted to the hospital so that they could clear the blockage.  We were told he would need to stay 3-4 nights.  My husband and I went home in total shock that our "bouncing baby girl" was actually a boy.  Anyway...later that night the doctor called me to let me know that Fern was stabilized.  Dr. Ballard saved our cat's life.  I cannot thank her enough.  Fern (now Vern) ending up staying in the hospital for four nights.  They have someone there around the clock (vet techs during the overnight hours).  Each morning the doctor on duty called to let us know how he was doing.  Dr. Ullman also treated Vern and was wonderful.  She is kind, patient and knowledgeable.  She called me a couple of times with updates on Vern and when we went to visit Dr. Ullman usually was the vet on duty.  She took the time to talk with us even thought I'm sure she was busy.    When I picked Vern up the vet tech went over all of his medicines in detail.    Everyone I interacted with at Alta Vista was pleasant.  They really love animals and you can tell.  Some vets seem to care more about making money than helping pets.  I didn't get that vibe at all.  In my mind our bill wasn't very much given that our cat was with them for four days.  Other reviews that complain about price at Alta Vista must be from people that haven't had much experience with veterinarians.

I just discovered this place and I live down the street.  I went there last night and have a feeling I will be back many, many more times.  I had the chocolate salted caramel pie and a velvet coffee drink.  Both were excellent.  It was very crowded but the wait was not long to pay and get my items.  My only complaint is that it's very hard to find the menu.  I want to go back for dinner but I literally couldn't find the menu for dinner, so I have no idea what they have.  I saw people eating mac and cheese, so I know they have dinner foods.

I've been going to Bark N Babies for about 4 years.  They always do a good job and the staff has always been friendly and kind.  Any specific instruction I've provided has been followed by the groomer.  The girl behind the counter referenced in another review is very sweet.  She always seems excited to see my dog, even though my dog is not super friendly.

As other reviews have mentioned, the space is very crowded.  There is barely room to stand inside of the door to wait.  The women that work in the salon have to eat their lunch sitting on a milk crate in the back and there is no space...so the crate is in front of the bathroom door and you can barely get inside.  I've found they do a fine job at pedicures, but do not go here for a gel/shilack manicure.  They polish starts lifting after two or three days.  I've been maybe five times and every single time this happens.  I won't be back for a manicure, despite their close proximity to my house (walking distance).    They also tell you they "prefer cash" when you try to pay with your card.  I find this odd for a business of this size, especially when they see you are paying with a card.  Whatever the reason, it made me feel uncomfortable.

Went to Urban 7 with my sister at 7:00 on a Friday night.  The place was dead.  There were only 2-3 other tables, yet our service was still very bad.  The waiter was 18 years old at best, and I think this was his first server job.  He was the only waiter in the entire place.  Nice kid...but it was just really awkward service.  I don't blame him, but you would think a place with the high end decor would have experienced servers.  He should have been working at Coco's or Village Inn.    The food is overpriced and mediocre at best.  Everything about this place is weird.  If I didn't have the $25 resturant.com gift card (that I paid $2 for), I would have felt really cheated and ripped off.  The food came out relatively fast, but we had to wait quite a while to place our order.  Oh, they brought out our appetizer with our entrees...no explanation...just acted like that was normal.    Honestly, I would be shocked if this place makes it another 6 months.  It has a very strange vibe.

My fiancé and I had dinner on a Friday night.  We arrived about 7:00 and I was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait.  The happy hour crowd was still lingering and unfortunately we were seated by two loud women that seemed as if they had been pounding drinks since 5:00.  I was really excited to try the deviled eggs since you don't see them on the menu that many places.  When they arrived the yolk part of the egg looked almost orange.  Weird.  They also had a very strong smell of some kind of spice or flavoring that they must use in making them.  I didn't like the smell but I'm not sure what exactly it was...maybe horseradish?  Unfortunately neither of us liked them and only ended up eating one half each.  For dinner I ordered the caprese salad and he had grilled chees with waffle fries.  When the food arrived it looked pretty good, but again his smelled very strongly.  This time of grease or a deep fryer.  Yuck.  I know French fries are fried, but I've never smelled a grease smell like that in all my years of eating them.  My salad was ok.  I didn't expect it to be great given that the Garage has more of a bar vibe than anything else.  We both agreed we wouldn't go back.  On the plus side, I can cross it off my list of places to try.

I had my one and only tattoo removed by Dr. Mundt.  She is such a sweet lady and made me feel very comfortable each and every time.  I thought the price was reasonable.  I believe I had my first treatment in Feb of 2012 and I was finished around November or December 2013.  I think I had a total of 10 or 11 treatments.  My tattoo was black ink and pretty small (1 inch x 1 inch).  The pain was minimal since I opted for the pain injection, but for some reason I got more and more anxious about each procedure as time went on.  The only thing I disliked was the parking.  It was usually difficult to find a spot.

The tableside mozzarella cheese is the reason I love this place.  The salmon is very good as well, but I probably wouldn't make the drive from central Phoenix if it were not for the awesome tableside cheese.  There is a pasta dish on the menu I've tried to order two different times...the first time they told me they were out (this was before Christmas) and the second time they told me their supplier stopped making the noodle (this was in mid February).  I wish they would remove it from the menu because I had my heart set on trying it.  As  I recall the menu was just an oversized sheet of paper.  You can tell they spared no expense with the décor, so spend the $1 and print some new menus so that your customers are not disappointed when ordering.

Phoenix Glow is the only place I've ever spray tanned, so I don't have a lot to compare it to but I like it enough to not even consider going somewhere else.  The owner, Ann, is so nice.  She makes you feel totally comfortable.  That's not easy to do when you are standing naked getting a cold spray put all over your body.   Her pricing is reasonable and she does an awesome job.

The employees in this office are so rude.  The woman on the far left kiosk that is mentioned in other reviews is the most miserable disgusting excuse for a human being I've ever encountered.  Every time I come in she is rude to every single person she helps.  She is so passive aggressive.  Slowly waddles around trying to take extra time to complete any task in order to make people wait longer.  My guess is she has no power in her personal life so she uses the tiny bit of control she has over customers by wasting their time as much as possible.  Don't even get me going on the employee that goes by the name of CeCe who told me I was interrupting her lunch break when she was called out to help by one of her coworkers.  FYI CeCe - it wouldn't kill you to skip a meal.  There is a reason these losers get paid $10 per hour.  There is one half way nice woman that works there.  The rest are horrible.

This place is a little misleading.  About a year ago I had dinner at this exact same location and it was simply called "Italian Restaurant".  It was ok...nothing special.  A few weeks ago I notice that Pizzeria Bianco had moved in and I was super excited since I've been to the downtown location and love their food.  I was surprised to see the menu looked pretty much the same as that of the former occupant "Italian Restaurant".  I think they just added pizza to the old menu and gave it a familiar name in hopes that it would be successful.  Lame.  The pizza we had was ok but not as good as the downtown location.  I wouldn't go back.  Also, the room they seated us in smelled like paint thinner and had a very odd decor.  Not appetizing.  Our waiter was slow and my napkin was soaking wet before I even touched it.

I've been here several times and always get the Pan Perdue.  It's excellent.  The staff is friendly and the food is prepared quickly.  I don't drink coffee, but my husband said their iced coffee is the best he's ever had.    My only complaint would be the various signs posted all over the place mandating that you do not sit down at a table unless you have placed your order.  I've never seen such a rule and I've certainly been out to eat many times.  Seems like an odd thing to enforce or care about.  What if your feet hurt or you are old or you have kids with you?  Ridiculous, especially given I've never witnessed a time where someone is standing around with food and no place to sit.

As far as gyms go, this one is pretty good.  The machines are always in working order and it's pretty clean.  All of the cardio machines have TVs with cable, which is nice.  On the weekends the locker rooms can get a little dirty, but that may be because male employees can't go in the women's room to clean, pick up towels, etc.  For the most part, it's not overly crowded and you can always get on a machine.  Because it's a small space, the machines are close together and sometimes people smell horrible...gross.  Heck, I'm probably one of them; it's a gym and I'm sweaty.  Staff are friendly, helpful and always say "hello" and "goodbye".  Also, they sell smoothies that are really tasty.    I will say that during Diamondbacks games the staff do not do a good job of ensuring that only members are allowed to park in the Mountainside lot. The staff that monitor the parking are D-backs employees.  There are two different men that work in the parking lot.  One is an old guy who walks up to ever car with his clipboard (and appears to be doing his job) but ultimately lets people park with or without a Mountainside permit.  The other is a young guy who sleeps on the bench while "working".  Not very effective.  The lot will be full but there are only three people in the gym.

This is my new favorite restaurant.  I've been twice in less than two weeks.  The lobster roll is delicious, as well as the heirloom tomato salad.  I've tried three desserts and they were all excellent.  Had the same waitress both times and she was very good.  She recommended items from the menu and I loved all of them.  Will be back again soon.

My husband and I had dinner at Phoenix Public Market Cafe last night and everything was wonderful.  It looked pretty busy when we walked up and I was worried there was going to be a long wait, but to my surprise they were able to seat us right away.  Our waiter was very attentive and friendly.  I had the chicken salad sandwich with fries and he had a pasta dish.  For dessert, we shared one of the pop tart pastries.  The pop tart was so good! I can hardly wait to go back.  We're going to try their breakfast this weekend.  I wish I had discovered this place sooner! The only con was paying $6 for parking.  There was a farmers market going on in the lot next to the cafe - this may have been their parking lot.

We decided to give Snooze a try this past Saturday.  I went prepared for an hour plus wait and was pleasantly surprised to find out the wait was only 15 to 20 minutes. We put our name in and they texted us about 15 minutes later.  On time...great!  We immediately go to the hostess stand and were told our table was being bused and to wait off to the side.  Um...ok...  Ten more minutes go by so I went back up to the hostess stand to see what was going on.  She said that I was going to be seated any minute.  I look at my phone and they had texted me again despite me standing in the exact same place the entire time.  Weird.  Anyway, we are finally seated.    I order a diet coke and the waitress brings me a coke.  No big deal.  I tell her and she brings me a new drink and takes our order.  In the meantime, apparently Snooze VIPs are seated next to us as the manager spent several minutes talking to them and they were even given a free pancake.  Nice.  Good for them.  Not so nice is when they get their food before us even though we were seated ten minutes earlier.  A half hour goes by....still no food. Our waitress says it will be out "any minute".  More people that were seated after us are getting food and some of them are even done eating by the time ours finally comes out.  I ordered the French toast, which was good but not great.  It was two slices of wonder bread with a strawberry or two on top.  My fiancé got a bowl of hash browns with some cheese on top.  I can't remember what they called it on the menu.  I guess the food was good enough that I would go back if the experience was better.  At this point it's not worth it for me.  We live less than a mile from Snooze and love to go out to breakfast.  Despite the convenient location, I don't think we will be back.

Two starts may be a little generous...more like 1.5.   We went early in the season and purchased fast passes (which were not necessary).  There were three different haunted attractions and all of them lacked staffing.  There were not enough entertainers...but there were plenty of shower curtains used to build mazes.  I didn't like touching them.  Thank goodness it was opening day before they were filthy.  That's all I really remember about this place and I was there less than a week ago.

This is hands down the worst Starbuck's I've ever been to. I always have to wait for a very long time for my drink. I've had them completely forget to make my drink on two occasions. The employees are nice but I think this store is poorly managed. There are homeless people inside of the shop who approach you and ask for change. The staff allows them to hang out inside even though they are not purchasing anything. Crack heads hang out in the bathroom for a very long time so customers cannot use it.

I love the French toast and pancakes.  I haven't tried anything else yet, because these things are so good I can't help but order them again and again.  It's a little loud inside when it's crowded and on the weekends there is a long line to order (unless you arrive early).  Some people might consider it a little overpriced, but I'm fine with it.

I can't get enough of this place.  We go here a couple times a week.  I like the sausage and onion pizza and we also get a salad.  There are three salads I really like: feta and turkey, the apple one, and the caprese.  My husband and I share a pizza and a salad.  There is more than enough food for each of us and the food is pretty inexpensive.  Staff is friendly, although you order at a counter and someone brings out your food.  Aside from that you don't have much interaction with a waiter as you would at a traditional sit down restaurant.

Southern food really doesn't interest me, but I decided to give this place a try since it's close to our house. I'm glad I did, as now it's one of our go to dinner places. I love the fried chicken and the bread pudding. My husband usually gets the ribs and he is always happy with them. Service is very good and normally if there is a wait for a table, it's reasonable. There is a cute book store next door where you can kill some time if necessary.
