Everyone that comes to Pittsburgh must try Primanti Bros at least once. I have been there multiple times but this is my first review of the place. The sandwich is something to see and eat especially after a night of drinking. The original location is definitely the best especially for the people watching aspect.   I chose the sandwich with bacon and cheese and it was definitely consistent with the other times I have been there, but I will say this after you have gone once you will never need to go back unless its late and you need something to soak up the alcohol.

I was visiting for the weekend and we were looking for somewhere to go watch the LSU versus Alabama game and we chose Lot 17. When we arrived we were able to find seats at the bar since there was barely anyone there. They have a nice selection of draft beers. The food was definitely above average for a bar. The sweet potato fries are as good as advertised and the dipping sauce could be consumed with a straw but the TV selection leaves a little to be desired. I understand it is a PITT bar but with 95% of the bar focused on the LSU/Alabama game you would think they could have moved the PITT game to a corner TV and use the center TV with sound for the majority of the bar that was concerned in the 'Epic' game. They did switch the games around while PITT was at half but as soon as that game started the LSU game was back relegated to the corner. The manager even made some comment that our group didn't appreciate but whatever it's not like I will be back anytime soon. If you are looking for some good bar food I say stop on by. If you are looking to watch a big game outside of Pennsylvania sports you may want to choose elsewhere or be relegated to the corner without sound.

Not a fan of this airport for one reason. There are very few ways to charge anything. Lots of chairs but no outlets. Not sure how such a busy airport can have such few options. Security was also a little strange I had pre-check which got me into a different line but then we just merged with everyone else. How does so much of the general public qualify for the pre-check line. It's not as bad as Midways system but it's up there.  Also I know it's 120 outside but does it have to be 90 on the inside?

I always made fun of all the people standing in line on the weekend mornings waiting to have breakfast at DeLuca's that was until I found myself waiting in that same line. I happened to be in Pittsburgh for the weekend visiting friends when it was suggested to try the place out. There had to be 30 or so people in line waiting to get into the place on a Saturday morning. It probably took 30 to 45 minutes to get to the front but the plus side is there is a coffee shop a few doors down to get something warm to drink. When we finally got it we were seated at the counter which was a fine place to sit considering you can watch all the cooks running around like crazy turning out food by the minute. There are lots of things that look good but I settled on an omelet with a bunch of vegetables and covered in three kinds of cheese that was downright awesome. My friend also had some combination of eggs and veggies which he proceeded to polish off something I could not do. We were also witness to a few people tackling the pancakes with the sundae on top. Good luck with that on early morning. I am not sure it is the best breakfast in town but it is certainly worth the wait especially if it's not too cold outside. I will be back.

Ok this review has two parts the first one was the ambience and the people near me. It is definitely casual and there were a ton of locals in the place which is normally a good sign. I was dining by myself since I was travelling for work so I chose to ditch at the bar. Bad call. There were two guys also siting at the bar and before I knew it I was deep in conversation on topics that I had no despite to talk about. They kept encouraging me to choose ribs on the menu even though I said no ribs. Secondly they made fun of my margarita  choice and the guy next to me insisted that I try his margarita because he hadn't tried his yet. I said no thanks. He then suggested I use my straw. Ah still not interested. At this point the owner offered to move me but I said I was fine.   Second portion the food. Wow I must say excellent and spicy. Even the chips and salsa gave me the head sweats. I ordered the burro and the owner suggested Christmas style which was half red and half green. Wow excellent again. The green left me wanting more water and more ice while the red did nothing to slow down the sweat firming on my forehead. Overall a great choice for food while in Phoenix. I will definitely be back and most likely will avoid the bar.

I usually attend a Steelers game every year and this one like all the others was crazy loud and intense until the end. My review of the stadium is that the crowd makes this place. It is so loud and the fans are so much into the game it is easy to overlook any shortcomings the stadium may have. It is tough to get into the stadium as game time approaches since there are thousands of fans and only a few gates and people working those gates. The concourses are wide, the bathrooms were never crowded and the concession stands were easy to get to. The view is also nice since the stadium is built right on the river. The parking is not too difficult and the tailgating that goes on is pretty amazing.

Went to Jerome's on Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. The place wasn't crowded but the Pirates game was still going. Every TV in the place had a different baseball game which was awesome since I definitely enjoy watching baseball.   I ordered the cheese flatbread which was actually very good and quite large. The Fiance ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was also quite tasty except that it was supposed to be on a kaiser roll but came out on a .25 hamburger bun. I definitely will visit again when I am back in the Burgh.

I think I have been to Pittsburgh at least 10 times and every time I come to town we make the trek down to the strip district on Sunday to browse all the shops. There are plenty of stores and stands and foods to choose from. I was surprised to see the amount of Pirate gear being hawked on the sidewalks usually no matter what time of the year it is it's all Steeler gear. I actually picked myself up a Roberto Clemente shirt to bring back to Chicago.  I highly recommend the spice store, the coffee shop, and the doughnut shop as stops that need to be made. Also if you need anything Steeler this is the place to go.

Wow was really looking forward to trying this place out while we were in the Burgh and I am sorry to say I was not impressed. The decor and service were great but the food was OK at best. The alligator was all breading, the fried green tomatoes were lame and my blackened fish was so dry it turned to dust when I touched it. Another person at our table got the same fish and it was cooked the same way which was too much. The scallops and noodles with cheese was by far the best dish at the table but even that lacked scallops. The alcohol selection was good and the cocktail I had with milk and bourbon (can't remember the name) was very tasty. Unfortunately the next time I am in pittsburgh I will be dining elsewhere.

I went to this restaurant while visiting the Burgh with a few other people. We sat outside which was nice since inside it is a little on the loud side but I believe the restaurant is set-up that way which is fine. They had a good beer selection. We started out with the cheese plate and the wild boar sloppy joe. Both were awesome and actually when we finished the apps we were not really hungry for our meals but we plowed through. The best thing of the group was the steak which was excellent. The fish and the pork chop were good but not as good as the steak. I had a pasta dish with a bunch of meat in it that I thought was pretty good. We were way to fill for dessert but overall I thought for the money it was very good.

They get the single star not for the doughnuts but because it was 112 degrees outside and they had no AC going in the restaurant. It may have been hotter in the restaurant than outside it.   It was hard to order since I couldn't concentrate on anything but the heat. I bought three doughnuts but couldn't ditsy to enjoy them because of the warmth. I bought the chocolate Bismarck, a raspberry jelly, and some sort of crunch doughnut. They were all good. Too bad I had to enjoy them in the car of the Starbucks parking lot. I will try them again hopefully in January when I won't care if it's so hit inside the restaurant.
