Five stars for the duck. It's special order so they don't have it all the time but it is amazing. Better than the duck I've had in new China town in California.

Expensive. Should definitely be 3 dollar sign. Majority of menu is expensive and above 20 dollars. Only thing worth it here is the burger. Place was super small and food was just alright but not worth the price.

If there was an ACE near my house I'd go broke. Food is so good and price is cheap for how much you get!  Great quality and taste for an amazingly cheap price. Try the Chinese coffee with milk tea and Mao Po tofu!

Awesome place. Great food and great drinks. Honestly sometimes the service can suck but for the most part they provide good service and food.  Get the jorito. The salsa is the fucking best. Also love the pancakes.

Ernie is a great guy and has been in the game for 30 years and knows his stuff. He was wonderful to talk to and work with. He helped me make a custom key work for my car that was originally intended for a miata.

Food was not that good and very small portions. Pretty much a rip off when it comes to quality and quantity.

It's called "most wanted tacos" now so it was difficult to find it but I may say it was worth the journey.  Best tacos I've had in arizona. Great seasoned meat and the staff was awesome. It was my first time there and the nice lady let me and some other customers try all the different types of meat before we made a selection.  Like others have said the 5 tacos is a great choice.  Got that with a side of beans and rice with an apple soda for 11 dollars.  Great price and great food!!!

The food is amazing but I love their pulled tea the most. I'd go there just for the tea. Atmosphere is nice as well. People are friendly.

They didn't have ingredients on their second day. Spent 30 minutes trying to find the place. They have no signs or anything and then they didn't have any food.
