If I could give a zero star review, I would for the Starbucks located inside bashas. I ordered a cool lime refresher with light ice and water, because of my teeth sensitivity to cold.  If I would say just light ice I found that my drink was very watery. A Starbucks employee actually recommended that I ordered light ice and water. They also fill it to the top with ice and very little drink for $4. Instead of telling me they were charging me an extra .80 for my drink they went ahead and did so without my permission. I drink at least 1 Starbucks everyday not to mention food and drink purchases for my family. It's ridiculous to try and fool your customers. Not to mention they did not have all the proper ingredients to make the drink. Did I say hey "you need to take off $1.00, because you were to incompetent to order the proper amount of ingredients until your next order date?" When I asked about the charge they said it was, because they put extra lime juice in the drink. I never asked for extra lime juice? You put extra lime juice so that the drink would be filled to the top, which was your decision to do. I told them they should tell customers before they charge you extra for something and she responded with "yeah, I know". If you know, then tell the customer. .80 cost more than an upgrade in size and almost a 25% mark up on the drink. I will never come to this Starbucks again or bashas, because of the customer service. Also, you should tell your employees not to tell the customers the protein/fruit bars you sell at Starbucks are cheaper on Amazon.   I was here two days prior with my mom and they were out of snowman cookies in the display. There was not a single customer around and when we asked for one she said "they are frozen in the back and we haven't had time to grab them." That's a lie. You are being lazy. There was not a customer in sight and two people talking behind the counter. When you see you are out of something and have it frozen in the back, go get it. I have been a food and beverage manager and in the food business 10+ years. All I can say is these people are not properly trained and do not possess the customer service skills needed for this industry. Have integrity and take pride in your job.

I love this target, especially the Starbucks inside of it. The employees inside of Starbucks are always friendly and sweet. I enjoy going in there, because I know it's always going to be a pleasant experience. I have had horror stories with Starbucks, but not here. Truly amazing with great customer service. This store is the reason I continue to be a Starbucks consumer. Thank you guys for being so amazing!

BEWARE. Worst haircut my son has gotten, I will never ever go back here. It's honestly deceitful that they are called great clips.  My son has his first preschool Valentine's Day dance tonight and his hair was absolutely butchered. I cried for the first hour after the cut, because he had such beautiful locks. I honestly don't know what she was thinking. I told her to keep it long and she cut everywhere too short except for the front piece. She made a huge bald spot in the side of his head I can't even call her a hairdresser because I could have butchered his hair better without having to pay. It's my fault for not going to a salon, people that work at these types of places do so, because lack of talent. Please don't waste your time, money, or tears at this place.

This Starbucks deserves an award. I drink Starbucks at least once a day and they always make it a great experience for me. Most friendly staff of any Starbucks I have ever been to. After all the bad Starbucks experiences I have had, this location definitely makes up for it. Other Starbucks should watch and learn from this location. Thank you guys for always being so awesome! You are appreciated.   Ps lizzy and kaylah (sorry about the spelling) are amazing!

By far the best of the as you wish locations. I have been to a couple of others that has mediocre if not rude service, but this location is wonderful. They are patient with my son and always so accommodating. The location in Mesa by the theater is kind of rude and did not take their time with my son's Christmas handprint. It was messed up and instead of redoing it they tried to go over it with their own finger. It would have taken 30 extra seconds to pound out the clay and take a new imprint. I brought the attention to the manager and instead of checking the handprint she asked the other employee if it was okay. That seems lazy to me. If a customer asks if something will be okay, go and look at it. Don't ask someone else, you are the manager. From now on the Glendale location is the ONLY location I will go to. Thank you guys for being amazing!
