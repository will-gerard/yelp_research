I'd give this one star for Store Manager Andrew who is rude and even treats his employees with disrespect. Sweet cashier Kathy is the only reason I went for two...oh and the helpful girl on the phone when I called to see if they had my item in stock. Andrew is lucky for these ladies because he by myself, turns customers away.

This is my second time at this location but I frequent others around the valley.   I have to say this was the WORST PB Bowl I've had yet. Here's why:  A) Four employees on duty, only one actually doing anything. As it was lunch rush, this left several other customers tapping their heels as well. We all stood at the counter waiting for over ten minutes for something that should take half the time. Also one of the three 'on duty but doing nothing employees' could have offered to bring it to our table but of course scrolling Instagram was more important.  B) The bowl itself seemed smaller than usual, was very watered down in consistency and lacked a peanut butter taste.  This is a great chain and I love eating at the other locations...this new one definitely has some kinks to resolve.

When a place tries to pretend that waiting 40 minutes for a drink is totally normal and okay...that's a red flag! Be aware when coming here!
