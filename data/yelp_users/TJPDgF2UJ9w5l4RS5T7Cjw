Great place for a first date. The owner Mario and his staff definitely know how to treat their guests. The food was amazing, and as authentic as it gets.

If I could give this place 0 stars I would. The lady in the front blatantly let people in for free and made my whole group pay. Even though we were all military! It sucked and it was a waste of ten dollars. Don't come here.
