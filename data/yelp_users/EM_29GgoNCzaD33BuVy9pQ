Granite Computer Solutions provides affordable, comprehensive and fast service. I love the new office in Tempe.  Currently using their cloud image backup  service which puts me at ease about data loss. While my business hasn't needed to recover anything, I know if we do, we're covered. They have also taken care of basic hardware issues.  I highly recommend for small businesses that can't afford (or don't need) dedicated IT staff but have recurring IT needs.

A few nice things first:  This little salon in the chandler mall is:  1. convenient 2. clean 3. easy to get an appointment  They did my eyebrows, and it was fine. 24 hours later -I now have a burn on the delicate skin of my upper eyelid and spent a lot of time tweezing brow-lashes they missed. It does have a nice shape... but I would much prefer to have crazy brows than have a scar.  YMMV  I won't go back.

I hear this place used to be wonderful, and wished I had visited it then. Last week when I went  I found everything oily & flavorless.  My Pad Thai was grotesque - it tasted like they substituted vegetables for lard. As it sat uneaten it congealed into into a solid block.    I'm health conscious, so this is definitely off my list.

What an awesome dive - they focus on the food and do it well at LuLu's.  The food was incredibly fresh and flavorful. I had 3 chicken tacos, guacamole and lemonade. The pico was perfect, very fresh with just a little heat. My tacos were well seasoned, and overall the meal was incredibly satisfying.  I really love this place and plan to add it to our rotation for good local places to eat and or get take out.

It's another basic strip mall nail salon, but what makes this place stand out is good ventilation, cleanliness, service, comfortable chairs and a pedicure that lasts six weeks.  They accept and post coupons regularly. I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a pleasant and frugal pedicure.

Dr. V and his staff are simply wonderful.   I've been going for more than 5 years. I have real dread before any dental  procedure. I walk into the office anxious, and the staff have always done an amazing job of not letting me wait and fret. Dr. V spends time to explain things to me before we do anything. I feel their treatment has been incredibly respectful towards my fear of dentists

The massage clinic is phenomenal, frankly I find the services her more personalized and carefully executed than most services I have had at resort-spas.  Over the past 4 years I have been to SWIHA more than 50 times. Once  I did  have a bad experience with a nervous student - and the clinic was amazingly apologetic over the experience.   SWIHA is a wonderful value and a great resource in our community for all of the people seeking pain relief and relaxation. Highly recommend, particularly for people looking for massage services at low price

They don't make substitutions, actually they won't even leave off a piece of cheese because as the waiter told me  "The menu is exactly as the chef wants it." when I replied I had food allergies I was given a smug response  "No, we don't do substitutions." again I asked if I could have something without cheese.  He said "no" and walked away from the table.  Then some fussy lady walked over and told me very loudly  "no substitutions!"  I walked out embarrassed. The staff are rude, obnoxious and classless.

Everything at Fuchsia reminded me of my dream bedroom when I was 11; pick, tacky and frilly. I went there for facial and massage; hoping to find a new local place for regular primping.  The facial was quite good, and I was looking forward to my massage.   Sadly, the massage was painful. I complained during and afterwards, and didn't feel the staff responded in an effective manner. Overall it was a poor experience, that I don't intend on repeating.  I would never return; there are too many salons and day spas to consider even trying them again.

Dr. Hunt has been our vet for the past 2 years.  Recently, one of our cat's health has started to decline, and Dr. Hunt and his staff have been absolutely wonderful in terms of their compassion, expertise and attentiveness to us during a very difficult time. Dr. Hunt simply cares about the animals he's treating. I can't express how much I appreciate Dr. Hunt following up about our pet's care after we saw the specialist, and how he made sure we understood what was happening.  I deeply appreciate how supportive he and his staff were about our decision  not pursue chemotherapy, further diagnostics and surgery- as recommended by the other vet - instead he has helped us give our pet the highest quality of life possible.

Picazzo's is one of the few places I enjoy eating lunch in Tempe. I have some irritating food allergies (gluten, egg and milk free) - and find it very difficult to simply order a lunch without asking the waitstaff to leave off everything. It's not the case at Picazzo's and I commend them for it.  My review is exclusively for the innovative, enormous and filling salads I eat at Picazzos.  The salads have a good mix of dark green leafy and romaine, and are loaded with veggies. Typically when I order my big salad at other places, after they remove the cheese, croutons etc, I am left with a giant pile of romaine, 3 cucumbers, 2 cherry tomatoes and a  cold piece of cut up chicken.  I don't use muchsalad dressing, so just imagine how tasteless this is...  The salads here have enough extra veggies to make every bite interesting.

It's a dive and it has delicious food. I go almost weekly. If it was cleaner it would definitely merit five stars.  I love the 36. Love it.

Pampered Foot is great for a walk-in neck/shoulder massage and they do a wonderful job with feet. I have gone to the Pampered Foot more than a dozen times, and each visit was quite good.  As someone with chronic pain, I appreciate how easy it is to get an appointment.  I also like the aesthetic of the place; it's clean and minimalistic. The reflexology "rooms" afford some privacy, and the chairs face the wall (which I appreciate since I would rather not be on display).   This isn't a luxury spa, but it's quite excellent for what it is.

What a nice local salon! Belle Melange reminds me of the small neighborhood salons I grew up with on the east coast.  Everyone was very friendly, the place is clean and I have a good haircut. The prices at Belle Melange are very reasonable too.   I'll be going there again, hopefully I finally found the right salon for me in AZ!

This is delicious New York Styled Chinese take-out.  The food has excellent flavor and the dishes are inexpensive and loaded with veggies.   My husband and I spent 3 years looking for a New York style Chinese restaurant. We had so many disappointing meals all over the valley.  Then we found this place, in our neighborhood! It was so wonderful.  This is not a place to sit and eat unless you're looking for a fast meal. It's a great take-out place, I can't recommend it highly enough.   The owners are very friendly - go there a few times and they'll remember you.

I've gone to several different reflexology places in the east valley over the past couple of years. My experiences with these businesses have been mixed and there are some places I would never go to again.  However,  I  love the convenience of walk in reflexology. It's inexpensive and in my opinion can much better than some day spas.  Relax station is among the best in the east valley. It's clean. They take and honor appointments. The people who work on you know what they are doing.   Bottom Line: This place is great for  affordable reflexology.

I must say I did get a good massage, but I have no intention on going back.  1. Everyone there tried to sell, upsell and or sign me up for their members only nonsense. Stop it, this irritates me as a spa goer.  2. There are ZERO amenities, the lobby is tiny, the rooms sterile little cubicles. 3. The prices are expensive, for the money I can easily go to a nice day spa with things like a sauna and water to drink.   Elements seems to think it's somehow something more than a strip mall massage club. It's not. I don't know how they stay in business. It's simply over-priced.

This is a good location and *should* be a decent place for a meal, but it wasn't.   I liked the old 56 East, nice little local place, it was the sort of place to meet a girlfriend for a glass of wine. My recent experience was very disappointing.  The service was appalling. When I go out to eat I expect a few things:  1. Don't  address me by saying "What can I get for you guy?"  It's rude. Oh, and I'm a woman. 2. If I ask to buy more of something the wait staff shouldn't argue with me about how "that's really enough for your table" particularly when I'm asking for more vegetables. 3. Don't throw plates down in front of me so heavily that it rocks the table.  The food was ok, but the service was so awful I don't even remember what I ate, I just couldn't wait to get out of there.  Avoid.

Incredibly good for casual dining  1. the flavors are exceptional 2. the menu is very inexpensive 3. they were realistic about the heat of the dishes  I loved the mango juice which complimented the spiciness of my chicken vindaloo very nicely.   It reminded me of eating in NYC, which is perhaps the best compliment I can give as an east coast transplant.

This is a wonderful reflexology place in the east valley. The massages are quality and the front desk staff is very friendly. I've been here about 5 times, and every massage I had was very good.   1. Clean, multi-chair rooms. I found when I was there if someone else was in the same room they did their best to keep us as far apart as possible.  2. They worked on everything I wanted and didn't work on things I didn't want. What this means is they read the intake forms and do what you ask. Having been to the majority of reflexology places in the east valley this isn't always the case.  3. Extremely inexpensive for the service they provide. I've had better massages here than other places that have charged 3-5 times what they charge.   I highly recommend you call first, as walk in appointments are hard to come by as they are getting more popular. Which is great for this business but bad for me because I'm lazy about calling ahead :)

I guess I'm just tired of nail salons in the east valley where I can't communicate effectively with my nail technician. At the last place I went to, the only words my nail tech said to me were:  "Toe" "Happy" and "Pretty toe!"  While kind of amusing, it was a much better experience to go to Martinee Nails in Gilbert where I could get an inexpensive pedicure AND talk to my nail technician.  Yay. +1  I'm cheap, I make no bones about that. I'm also busy enough to need a nail salon where I can get a walk in appointment.  Martinee hits both notes very well.  +2  For 25 dollars I had a hot stone pedicure that  rivaled the experience that I've had at spas for more than twice the cost. The pedicure chairs are very comfortable. My technician did a wonderful job with the whole experience. It really is a good value for the money. +1  It's clean and doesn't smell like a nail salon. +1  I'll definitely go back.

While the service was fast... My meal reminded me of  a school lunch's "Taco Day" where the food is made with the the least amount of flavor and uses the cheapest possible ingredients. The beans tasted tinny like they just came out of a #10 can, and the rice tasted like instant. My tacos were generously filled, and they served a LOT of food for the money, but when it has no flavor, and I find the majority of my meal inedible - it's not worth it.  Like another reviewer mentioned, it didn't even smell like Mexican food inside. With so many local, authentic , less expensive Mexican Taquerias, I can't imagine ever going back. I was really hoping for better,  since I drive past it nearly everyday.

I've been here 6 or 7 times. They are simply the best foot spa I've been to in the valley. It's clean, decorated beautifully and consistently a great experience.   Every visit has been excellent, with different therapists which in my experience as a spa goer makes them uncommonly good.  I also liked the fact the therapists each had a slightly different style and paid attention to my stiff spots.    This is an inexpensive fully dressed chair massage. I know this isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I think it's a great alternative to a traditional table massage. Particularly good in the summer, when it's kind of gross to feel oily.  I also found the front desk staff to be very friendly and helpful. Just go, you'll enjoy it.

This is a small gym with small classes where you'll find a genuinely nice community of people from the staff to the clients. As someone who is just trying to learn the basics I was made to feel very welcome and comfortable.  Strength training is new and difficult for me. The trainer Matt, made sure his instructions scaled to my ability which I found incredibly helpful.   Gyms around town have such different offerings/cultures so let me highlight some specifics:  1. It's a studio styled - open gym, with lots of strength equipment: strength machines, kettlebells, weight racks, sled, tires etc. 2. Cardio here primarily involves lifting heavy things rapidly. No treadmills, no zumba classes. 3. It's clean, also they can open the bay door at the rear of the gym for fresh air which is a nice feature. 4. Very welcoming to different abilities, ages etc.
