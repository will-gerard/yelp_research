I'm so glad that there is at least one Asian grocery store in the valley. Unfortunately they seem to have a hard time keeping some of my favorite items in stock, I wonder if this is a result of some of the import restrictions/delays that have been a result of the recent quality issues with food and toys imported from China.  I'm half Chinese and spent much of my youth being dragged around Chinatown near L.A. by my grandmother and 6 or 7 aunts. So the 99 Ranch Market brings back memories...some fond...some not quite so. But, at any rate, the prices are great and the selection is good and authentic (when it's in stock). The cashiers could use a little dosing from the friendly fairy, however. Then again, I don't remember many friendly cashiers or clerks at any of the stores I frequented as a kid...so I guess it just makes the experience all the more genuine for me.  I would recommend going on a weekday, or, if you must go on the weekend, just avoid going around lunchtime. There's a dim sum restaurant in the same shopping center and the parking lot gets pretty jam packed with cars and pedestrians.

Okay, let me get my biggest gripe out of the way first: no polar bears! Yes, yes, I know...it's Arizona, it's too hot for polar bears, but that doesn't make me any less sad.  Now, onto the real stuff. I got an annual membership for $50 which means I can visit almost any time I want except during special events. I get discount tickets to Zoo Lights and so on. That price isn't bad considering that regular admission is $14. I've already been twice in the last week (no, I don't have a life).  The animals are still a little lethargic, recovering from a very hot summer. So far I have yet to see the male lion do anything but sleep very soundly. However, I did meander over to the porcupine enclosure at just the right time and got to see her chase her handler around the enclosure and "target" for treats. I can honestly say I had never before seen a trained porcupine. The safari-type enclosure that houses the giraffes amongst other African animals is really cool. And the baboons LOVE having their photograph taken, no joke. There aren't as many animals as other zoos in smaller metros that I've been to, but the climate around here really limits the types of animals they can keep. Still, it's a cool place to walk around. It's really spread out and easy to get lost in, which is fine by me. Oh, and don't forget to visit the wallabies!

If I could give negative stars, I would. I opened an account at Compass Bank back in NM in 2002. Don't ask me why I kept the stupid account for so long...I suppose I thought it was better than some of the alternatives (BofA or Wells). Of the many many many things about Compass that irk me, the biggest is how they balance your account every day and their funds availability policy. Here's a real life example that has happened more than once: I get a direct deposit on Friday, it shows up on my AVAILABLE balance first thing Friday morning. On Thursday I had $20 left in my account, but with my direct deposit on Friday morning, I now have several hundred dollars in my available balance. I go to the gas station and the grocery store, spend $25 at one, $60 at the other. Monday rolls around and I'm hit with 2, yes two overdraft fees for $27 each. I go into the bank to inquire as to why and I'm told that I overdrew my account on Friday. "No, I had a direct deposit hit my account Friday morning and show in my AVAILABLE balance before I ever went to the gas station or the grocery store". "Yes, but we take all charges out of your account before crediting any deposits at the end of the day". "Then why did my AVAILABLE balance show that I had several hundred dollars if it was not AVAILABLE to me?". "Because it doesn't get credited to your account until all the charges have been taken out". "But why?". "Because that is the way we do it because we're greedy @$$H0^&$". Okay...so I made that very last one up...but this is essentially the way any conversation goes when they've wrongfully taken your money, and good luck getting it back. I finally just gave up. When I went to another branch to close my account, the banker asked why, I told her that in the 6 years I'd been banking with Compass, the customer service had consistently gotten worse. She then asked if I'd like to air my greivances then and there, and I wasn't about to go through it all again and get the lecture about how I should balance my checkbook...yada yada yada. I've worked at banks. I know how to balance my checkbooks and keep track of spending. I also know that at other banks, if your account says you have an available balance based on a direct deposit, you don't have to wait until the next business day to use those funds. Do yourself a favor...don't bank with Compass.

After writing my review of the 99 Ranch market yesterday, I came across some reviews for Lee Lee's. So I stopped in to check it out on my way to work yesterday. Everything I read in the reviews about Lee Lee seems to be true. This place is huge and well stocked. I was easily able to find plenty of the items I hadn't been able to find at 99 Ranch last time I was there (like my favorite brands of chicken dumplings and shrimp crackers). There is certainly a wide variety of merchandise to choose from. I have never seen a wider selection of chopsticks in all my life.  I have two minor complaints: 1. I'm pretty sure whoever was given the pricing gun got a little confused from time to time. There were two steaming pots that were identical, one was $17.99, the other $19.00. I noticed price discrepencies amongst other items as well. Also, the organization and placement of certain products was a little confusing. For example, normally I would expect to find the shrimp crackers with the shrimp chips (if you don't even know what I'm talking about, just take my word for it). However, these items were in two completely different aisles. I found jam in a different aisle than peanut butter and Nutella, which seemed odd (these are all things spread on bread...so why not group them together). It may be that these items are grouped by country of origin or something (this is how it is done at Ta Lin Market in Albuquerque), but if this is the case, it should be made a little more clear...then again, maybe I missed the signs. When you go, whether you are looking for something specific or just browsing, you need to go up and down every aisle, otherwise you may miss something.  Anyway, I'll still shop at 99 Ranch because I like going to the Chinese Cultural Center, even if it is little more than a strip mall playing dress up. However, I think I will do the bulk of my Asian food shopping at Lee Lee's from now on.

When we were getting ready for our trip to Arizona I got on Yelp to stake out the best Sushi places in the area. Kyoto seemed to have some of the best reviews, so we decided to check it out. We got there just in time, they close at 2pm for lunch and open back up for dinner later in the day.  The salmon was fantastic. The unagi was fantastic. the rolls were nothing spectacular, in fact, a little dry. But, all in all, a quality sushi place. The prices were reasonable, about what you'd expect to pay for decent sushi. What I want to know is this: Is there a good "all-you-can-eat" sushi place anywhere in Phoenix or the surrounding burbs?

No Yorkshire pudding...NO YORKSHIRE PUDDING?!?!?!  Other than this one serious omission from the menu, the British Open's menu is chock full of great English fare as well as a few tastes from around the world. I've been to B.O. twice now and have had great service and food both times. This last trip I had a nasty head cold so I got a bowl of Green Chile Stew (not something you'd normally expect to find at a British Pub, but I was most glad I did). Well, that green chile did a fantastic job of burning all the crap out of my sinuses and I was able to breath for a good hour afterward (one of many great uses for green chile). We also had the Sausage Rolls which we proceeded to drench with HP Sauce and devour. B.O. also has a great Bread Pudding!  The atmosphere is great, but I did notice one small problem. The place isn't very handicap accessible. There was a woman who came in while we were there who had just had hip-replacement surgery. There was no place she could sit at which she did not have to climb a step and it was obviously very difficult for her. After witnessing this I looked around and realized that there were no tables that would be accessible to someone in a wheelchair.

Mmmm...Kiltlifter!  I've been to Four Peaks several times, but gosh dang it, I can't tell you a thing about the food! I know I've eaten there, but honestly, when I think of Four Peaks, I think of beer and nothing else. The Kiltlifter is by far one of the best beers I have ever had the pleasure of chugging. You can get bottled Kiltlifter in stores now, but you gotta try it from the tap at least once. In its freshest state, Kiltlifter is as close to perfect as an amber ale can get.  And of course there's food at Four Peaks...I have a vague, fuzzy memory of a pizza with pine nuts. I think it was good...  BTW, I'm a little confused as to why 48 people voted that there was no alcohol at this place...it's a brewery???

I'm not a huge fan of pizza...but I like this place because they have really good food in addition to pizza. The wings are AMAZING. You can't get two seperate flavors in one order of wings (which kind of bummed me out), but you can get the sauces mixed together. So the waiter suggested the Wong sauce mixed with the Medium sauce...holy cow! So so so so yummy! And I tell you what, that medium sauce has a hell of a kick. I was sweating by the time I got through my 5th wing. I'm kinda afraid to try the Hot sauce.  I've also tried their Meatball sandwich. I got the Junior size and still couldn't finish the thing! I also got the side Chicken Ceaser Pasta salad which was tres delicious.  You can also get giant stuffed pizzas which I hear are amazing, but they take about 40 minutes to get to your table which gives you plenty of time to fill up on beer. Which brings me to my biggest piece of advice if you plan on eating at Oregano's: wear loose fitting pants.  The location on University is always pretty busy, parking can be a bit messy and they won't seat you until your entire party is there. So I recommend carpooling.

It's been about a month and a half since I've treated myself to sushi. I made the decision about noon time today that it was time I took myself out. Seven hours later I finally arrived at my chosen destination...Crazy Fish. I'm still new to town and figured I'd give it a shot. I kinda really wish I'd gone somewhere else. After having been sushi deprived for so long I was hoping for a little piece of sushi heaven. A little bit of Unagi bliss... It took over half an hour for my first pieces to arrive at my table, mind you, the restaurant wasn't jam packed or anything, maybe 8 other tables had people, most of whom had already received their orders. The cuts of salmon were huge, that was great, but then I bit into the pieces and discovered the rice had been over cooked and was a little crunchy (how do you screw up rice?). Another five minutes ticked by and my salmon skin roll arrived. It was overwhelmingly  underwhelming with its random sauce and lack of toasted-ness. Finally, my unagi pieces arrived. The two things I love most about unagi are the texture (crispy mixed with soft) and the sauce. Well, there was no crispy and the sauce was so thick I had to chew it. Not to mention that it cost a whole heck of a lot more than it should have. I was probably spoiled by the all-you-can-eat sushi place in Albuquerque... Oh, one last thing, they didn't even ask if I wanted any Miso soup!

Nestled in the strip mall cleverly disguised as Phoenix's Chinese Cultural Center, this restaurant serves authentic Dim-Sum during lunch time seven days a week.  Now, you have to understand that, my mother being chinese and having grown up near L.A. I spent most of my childhood weekends in Chinatown. I know what it is to go to Dim-Sum on a weekend amidst a shouting hoard of Chinese people who all sound like they are arguing, but are really just having polite conversation. That being said, I've never been to this restaurant on a weekend, and probably wouldn't recommend it unless you are already hard-of-hearing.  Anyway. This place is the most authentic Chinese restaurant I've seen outside of L.A. They have several carts circulating throughout the dining area from which you can select from a wide array of various Chinese fare. It's sort of like a Chinese appetizer buffet. However, keep in mind that you pay for each dish, and some are more expensive than others. From what I could tell, the prices for each dish range from about $3 to $7 and up. You can select from Shark Fin dumplings (very tasty) to Spring Rolls to Chicken buns to Chicken Feet (this, I don't recommend) and so on and so forth. I don't know the name of my favorite dish (I never did learn Chinese), but it comes on an oblong plate and the best way I can describe it is a rice roll with meat inside. I heartily recommend the shrimp or BBQ pork. Many of the servers speak little or no English, so if they recognize you as a non-Asian they will simply smile and lift up all the lids for you to see what's inside the dishes they have available. So don't be afraid if you don't have a Chinese-speaking person with you. Be brave, try something new...

I went to Sushi Eye for lunch on a Friday. The place was packed, the waitresses looked a little stressed and some of the clientele was a little crabby because they had to wait a little longer for their food. Honestly, I've waited longer at sushi restaurants for sushi that wasn't worth it. I found the pieces at Sushi Eye to be pleasantly large, the rolls were delicious and well made and the service was very friendly. We tried the Booty Booty Roll, the Salmon Skin Roll and a few pieces of Sake (salmon) and Unagi. My only complaint was that we didn't have individual plates, so eating the end pieces of the Booty Booty roll was a little challenging because there was no way either one of us, even with mouths as large as we have, could fit the entire piece with the shrimp tails sticking out, in one shot...so we ended up with a lot of rice in our soysauce dishes. But, it was a fun adventure anyway. Oh, and the Nigiri...the pieces of salmon were twice as long as most other places. Compared with the other sushi places I've been to in AZ (all two of them), the prices at Sushi Eye were the most reasonable. The regular rolls average around $6 or $7 while the special rolls (like the Booty Booty) average around $9 to $14. The Nigiri pieces were around $4 or $5.  One thing that did confuse me a little at first, and I'm not trying to be picky here, I just want to help out people who have never been there before: the rolls are all listed in the front section of the menu while the pieces are listed in the back section, so you kind of have to look for them. This is important because somebody actually comes and takes your order rather than you filling out a slip of paper writing in how many of each item you want. If you go to their website, sushieye.com, you can see a full color menu there. It's worth checking out before you go.  Oh, and they have a new location opening in Chandler in November.

Ever since my first IKEA experience about 12 years or so ago I've been addicted. From the inexpensive little accessories (clip frames, pizza cutters, cat toys...) to the fabulous furniture (much of it comes in some form of mix-n-match) to the ability to stuff it all into my little hatchback!  I understand that in Europe, IKEA is the Wal-Mart of furniture stores. But the furniture I've purchased at IKEA has endured much longer and much better than anything I've ever bought at Wal-Mart. We bought a couch there about three years ago. We bought a new cover once simply because our cats can be very rough on upholstery. However, the couch itself is still in great shape and just as comfortable as the day we bought it.  As to the complaints of the furniture coming un-assembled, it's not just about price, it's about convenience too. When we lived in NM and made a special trip out to AZ just to go to IKEA, it was nice to not have to rent a U-Haul just to get everything back. We bought an entire living room once and took it back to NM in the back of a Ford Explorer. Sure, we had to use a little elbow grease to put everything together, but, you know what, we felt good at the end of it when we finally slumped down in our new couch, we had a sense of accomplishment and we'd done something together other than mindlessly watch tv. Assembly is half the fun!

So I knew I wanted to go to a midnight screening of  the Dark Knight pretty much since the movie was first announced. I also knew that I should buy my tickets well in advance because this thing was going to be not just huge, but GINORMOUS (sp?)! However, since my life is filled with indecisive people, I had to wait to the last minute to buy tix. When I was finally able to ascertain exactly how many tickets I needed to purchase, Harkins @ Tempe Marketplace was completely sold out, much to my chagrin. So, I traveled a couple of miles down the 202 to Cinemark at Mesa Riverview.  I approached the ticket booth and asked the pimply teenager if there were any tickets left for any of the midnite showings of TDK. He said yes there were, they had about 25 tickets for each auditorium reserved for people who bought tickets online. This confused me, so I attempted to clarify: "so, I need to go home and buy the tickets online?". His response was "no, I can sell you the tickets here"...okay...so why the whole speech about the tix being reserved for online purchase? Then...it get's better, oh yes it does...he tells me "the seats will probably be right up front though". Okay, "is it assigned seating?". "No". "So, if we get here early, it won't be a problem right?". "I guess not". So at this point I am completely baffled. Is this guy stalling? What is with all this needless banter? Anyway, I finally purchase my tickets and make my merry way home.  That night, we get to the theatre about an hour before the show. Somehow they've already let everyone into the theatre, which was a little odd. But we still managed to find decent seats. I went to the concession stand and I swear the girl filling my popcorn must have been the ticket guy's twin brain. I asked for a regular size water bottle and she responded "we only have two sizes, big and small". The "small" looked a lot like a regular size bottle of water to me. Then she had to ask me twice which soda I wanted and what size popcorn (which was the foulest popcorn I've had in a movie theatre in about a decade).   Back in the auditorium a nasty, bitter assistant manager kept yelling at different members of our party because we weren't all in our seats (we were out at the concession stand or in the bathroom) and kept trying to give our seats to other people. I must say, that really topped off the day. So, yeah...despite the crowds, despite the noise, I think I'll stick with Harkins.

I know, I know. You're supposed to support independent book stores. You're supposed to shun corporate America chain stores. The sentiment behind "You've Got Mail" was not lost on me. Well, this is why I don't shop at Barnes & Noble. Borders, however, is a different story. Part of it is the people, part of it is the Borders Rewards program and a huge chunk of it is the selection. I visited my first Borders in Santa Monica about 15 years ago, give or take a couple of years. I remember thinking how much cooler this place was than B&N. Everything was so much brighter, so much warmer, so much more hip. B&N always made me feel like I had snuck into some crotchety old man's library. Borders made me feel welcome.  The staff at the Scottsdale Borders store by Scottsdale Fashion Square is awesome as is the staff of the Mesa store right by Fiesta Mall. Anytime I go into either of these stores there's always someone around to help me search for whatever I'm looking for, but they don't breathe down my neck if I'm just wandering. You can tell that much of the staff is as enthused about good books as I am and it's nice to share that passion. Plus, like the Borders stores back in New Mexico (see my previous review), there's always some quirky staff member who you just can't help but fall in love with.  Then there's the Borders Rewards program...I love it! With this program I almost never pay full price for anything. I always get at least 20% off, and, if I'm patient enough, I often get 30 or 40% off coupons that have probably saved me at least a couple of hundred bucks by now. Plus, when you spend a certain amount in the stores you get Borders Bucks. Best part is, they keep track of it for you on  your card (no silly stamp cards to lose).

We decided to check this place out for a late lunch on a Monday. The place wasn't terribly busy, just a few other patrons. There were two sushi chefs on duty, more than adequate for the number of people in the place...and yet, our first rolls took 15 minutes to get to our table. Our last roll didn't show up until about 30 minutes after we ordered and they almost completely forgot our Unagi pieces (which I found odd considering the waitress had highlighted all our selections on the order slip to make sure the chefs didn't forget anything).   They have an all-you-can eat deal for $25 per person. But we were thinking we didn't want that much, so we just ordered off the regular menu, it still ended up costing us $50 for two! Now spending $50 on sushi for two is all fine and good and pretty common. But you expect a little something more when all you ordered was a couple of rolls and a few pieces. Plus, you expect quality...while the sushi wasn't HORRIBLE, it wasn't GREAT or even very good by any means. It was just plain blah! Even the special roll we ordered was boring (I don't remember which state it was named after because all the names seemed to have been assigned arbitrarily and this was all just too gimicky even for me).  They automatically charge a 15% gratuity no matter the size of your order or party. Now, I suppose from their point of view, it was a good thing they did when we were there because we would have leaned more toward the 10% or lower mark. I'm sorry, but tips are given based on level of service and quality, neither of which were supplied in abundance by Koi. My advice? Sushi Eye! Still by far the best sushi I've had since I moved out here, the best price and the best special and original rolls!!!

Couches in the back that smell like a bus in L.A. in the middle of a heat wave (think sweat, booze and a hint of urine). Carpet that smells like a cat box. Ceiling fans that only circulate the stiflingly hot, non-air conditioned air. Cranky bar tenders who seem to have forgotten how to smile. Screaming teenagers moshing, stage diving and crowd surfing. Yeah, that's what a good music venue is all about!  So, like many have complained, the Clubhouse smells bad. The air conditioner is either broken or taxed beyond use (a friend told me it's not usually that hot in there). You can't take your drinks to the mosh pit. They have signs up that say "no re-entry without ID". But, here's the thing, if you're young enough to want to be right up by the stage and get in the thick of things, you're probably a teenager or a young adult. If you're a teenager, you shouldn't be drinking anyway. If you're a young adult over 21, you probably already got drunk before the show. If you're a little older like myself and many of my friends, you might still enjoy a good live show, but you'd rather leave the moshing to people who break a little less easily. I'm glad the bar area is in the back, because I can sit back and relax without having to worry about some hyped-up kid running around and knocking my drink out of my hand, but, if I feel the urge, I can ditch my drink and go join the throngs up front and get the crap kicked out of me. And, as for the going outside thing, I think if you're nice enough to the door people (you know, make eye contact, say "hello", etc) they're likely to let you back in anyway. At least, that's been my experience. The first time I went to this venue we were there for about 6 hours (Battle of the Bands). The door guy remembered us after the first time and we didn't have to show our IDs or bracelets when we went in and out. The last time I went there, for Finch and Scary Kids, there were a ton of kids going in and out for cigarettes or to cool off in the rain, and I never saw any problems arise from this. There is a large parking lot available, but you still might want to get there early or park across the street, the lot get's pretty full once the show is in full swing.  And you know, even when the place was packed, the sight lines were still REALLY good for a venue of this size. And this place really does get some good bands for the price. MXPX & Lagwagon are coming soon. Reggie and the Full Effect, RX Bandits will also be playing there over the next month or so. Come on people, if you're really passionate about music and you're going to a venue that DOESN'T smell a little like B.O. you're going to the wrong place. B.O. and a good show go hand in hand. If there isn't a stink of sweat, people aren't having enough fun.  Honestly, I think that the people who are so affronted by the smell or layout of this place should just stick to shows at generic commercial venues (like the Dodge Theatre). Shows at venues like the Clubhouse are all about energy, fun and rocking out to good music...leave your negative chi at home.

I grew up in SoCal and had access to In-N-Out pretty much whenever that craving hit. Then I lived in Colorado and New Mexico for 10 years. Ten long years of torture, unsatisfied cravings and crappy burgers. So it is without shame that I admit that a huge deciding factor in my move to Arizona was the presence of In-N-Out burger.  There's no dollar menu, only 3 combo meals and except for the price, the menu is essentially the same as it was 50 years ago. Yet In-N-Out is ingenious in its simplicity. You always know what to expect: fresh meat, never frozen; fresh cut french fries; fresh lettuce and tomatoes; and real American cheese.   I live just up the street from the Rural and 202 location. Like every other In-N-Out I have visited in the area, the store is clean and the staff are all friendly and each possesses many more brain cells than your average McDonald's or Burger King employee.   If you've never been, or rarely get to go, then you definitely want to go with the Double Double, fries and a shake. If you get to go there more frequently then you might want to scale back to a regular cheeseburger unless you have a really fast metabolism. Also, Google "In-N-Out secret menu" for a complete list of all the secret menu items such as animal style burgers and fries, 4X4's and the like. I definitely recommend the animal style fries...so tastey.

If you can deal with the fact that most of the other movie-goers sitting in the same theatre as you think that because they only paid a few bucks to get in they can talk through the entire movie, this is a pretty good place to catch a flick.  It's pretty typical that most people who attend shows at discount theatres don't have much respect for the "silence is golden" ideal. For some reason, paying LESS for a movie means they should have MORE privelages, such as sitting directly in front of you when every other seat in the place is empty.  But, rude and noisy patrons aside, and ignoring the fact that you have to see Michael Pollack's ugly mug every other slide during the pre-show ads, this is a great place to go see a movie. You pay about a third of what you would pay at a regular theatre, and they tend to get movies a lot faster than discount theatres used to. Whereas it used to take 9 months for a flick to hit the discount theatre, it now takes 3 or 4. Right now (late October) you can see movies that came out in July and later. Not to shabby if you ask me. Oh, and their kid's pack with an Icee upgrade...superb value for $2.50.

There has rarely been a Target that I haven't liked. The bonus about this one is that it's shiny and new.   Located at the new Tempe Marketplace shopping center this store boasts all the amenities and other cool things we've grown to love about Target. Everything from cool clothes at decent prices to DVDs to groceries.  The employees at this location are great too. There is one cashier that's helped me twice at this store, both times calling me over to her register when all the other registers had lines.  Plus, their shopping carts are made almost entirely of plastic instead of metal. I don't know why this is important, but I like it.

Go on Sunday and get the Yorkshire Roast Beef. I also highly recommend the Scotch Eggs. This place has the best British fare I've had in a long time (since the King's Head Pub in Santa Monica and not including when I lived in England). It's a little pricey, but we shared the Scotch Eggs & Yorkshire Roast Beef and topped the entire meal off with some bread pudding and after all was said and done, we were well stuffed and paid around $30 for the meal with tip. The decor is certainly "Quintessentially British", although I was slightly affronted by the lack of Manchester United paraphanelia (there was some, but I saw quite a few more scarves for Liverpool, oh well, the food made up for it).

This was one of the few places we found open on Christmas day and we went for dinner. Even though the place was packed and there was a line out the door, we were seated in less than 10 minutes and the service was excellent.  Having lived in New Mexico for about 5 years, I've learned a lot about green chile. I've also learned that more often than not, when you visit a restaurant serving green chile outside of New Mexico, their idea of "hot" is what we would call less than mild in NM. So, I was pleasantly surprised at Arriba's when I ordered a two chile dish (1 chile being mild, 2 medium and 3 hot) and got what I'd hoped for. Personally, I can't handle anything beyond medium when it comes to green chile unless I'm so sick that my taste buds are numb (which is when hot green chile is ideal). However, i was there with two people who like their chile VERY hot. One of them ordered a 3 chile dish and the waitress looked at him suspiciously (he's a pastey white guy, not one you'd peg to be able to handle spicy food) and asked if he'd ever had green chile before. He informed the waitress he was from NM at which point the waitress smiled and understood. Less than 10 minutes later my friend's eyes were watering and he had a big grin on his face. It was good stuff.  Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed by my margarita. You would think that this giant concoction (they come in those really huge margarita glasses), the entirety of which I finished, would have at least caused me to slur a word or two by the end of the night...but, alas, I didn't even get a buzz.
