Too much hype for decent over priced pizza. Service was good but I don't think I would go back. Got the margarita pizza it tasted good but it was so expensive. And burnt even though I understand the concept of brick oven.

Ate: Half a chipotle chicken sandwich and half southwestern salad  $: Too much money for a sandwich and salad that barely fill you up. If they don't give you that 'free' cookie I'd probably have to spend 12-13$ for a decent amount of food.  Recent experience: Asked for spinach on my salad and the lettuce that was already in my to-go box (less than when you eat there) seemed to rub the worker the wrong way so she removed half of it. Suffice it to say, my salad didn't even cover the bottom of the box. Not enough chicken, not enough ingredients and she was incredibly rude about it. She talked about hating how customers asked for extra things. To be honest the ingredients cost next to nothing for the corporation let alone the employee. I am not expecting a pound of chicken but someone in management needs to do something about it. Otherwise they will lose customers daily due to their service and how cheap they are.   I did however appreciate some of their employees who were very kind. For the most part I would not go back here unless I was dragged back in. The taste of food is important but so is service and quantity.   No thanks.

A friendly atmosphere with an amazing owner. He always lets me wait for the freshest bagel and is from the northeast and my hometown so he definitely understands what makes a good bagel. Don't waste your time at einsteins bagel. I've recommended his restaurant to many people, no one has been disappointed!

When I hear, amazing, the best, fresh, tasty...etc I am expecting really great things.   I ordered garlic naan, samosa and channa masala. Naan was hard by the time I got home. Garlic was sprinkled on so either this thing was microwaved or made first and sat out.   The channa masala was so dry, there was no gravy whatsoever. When I opened it, it smelled very good however it was too dry to eat. The picture is not the same.   Lastly the samosa was definitely microwaved...it was cold within a minute of bringing it home.   People may say that I should have eaten there however I have ordered takeout from many places before, this isn't my first time eating indian food.
