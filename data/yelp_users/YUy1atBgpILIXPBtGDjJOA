This gym has the worst employees. I came for the first time and received the most attitude ever from the agent at the front with their manager standing next to them. I treat stray animals better than the way they treated me there.

Out of all the coffee spots I've visited in my life, this place is my favorite. (And I never stepped foot out of the car)  The Customer service was phenomenal from an employee named Yoshi. If you're looking to start your morning on a positive note, please check this place out.

I love Chipotle especially with the app to allow you to order ahead of time. This is the first time I didn't have a good customer experience. I came in 15 min after the stated time and they still didn't have it ready. That wasn't the issue but it was that they rushed my order and had it completely wrong. I've never had to treat chipotle like McDonald's where I have to double check my order but will do moving forward. Cashier was really nice though. The execution of my order along with timing of completion is what gives this establishment 1 star.

If I could give no stars I would. I called in to know the specials and the worker there was so disrespectful. If you don't like your job, quit. I hope management watches who they hire because they lost a household today.
