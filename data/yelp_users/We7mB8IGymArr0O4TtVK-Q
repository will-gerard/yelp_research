My poor cat was very very sick, not eating, drinking, not going to the bathroom, vomiting everywhere, etc. I took him in on Monday and they did X-rays to find that he had a blockage in his lower intestine. The first thing the vet said was that he needed surgery and that the only other option was to take him home and wait overnight to see what might happen. I asked about the possibility of a laxative, since it was in his lower intestines. That might help him to pass whatever it was. The vet seemed hesitant but finally agreed that it could do the trick. She still seemed hesitant to let me leave with him though.   After getting him home, I used an eye-dropper to give him fluids as well as the laxative. It didn't seem to be helping much so I started researching and found that I could give him an enema and it should do the trick. I became even more suspicious of the vet, considering their only option would have cost me over 2K but my solution that I found recommended by vets all over was only $10. I decided to give it a try and IT WORKED!   My cat is happy and healthy again and I would NEVER EVEN THINK OF GOING TO THIS VET AGAIN. All they want is money. If they cared about my cat's comfort or well-being, they would have tried everything possible, before resorting to surgery. Monkey deserved so much better...  SHAME!!!

After our house being without a diving board for months and the pool store blowing us off and actually claiming there was no solution for a replacement, other than spending thousands of dollars to install an entirely new setup, I did my research and found a replacement board in less than 2 days for a fifth of the cost they wanted to charge us.  Once we told them that we needed our old board back so that we could fix the problem ourselves, Mike (the owner) took it upon himself to throw it out so that we couldn't use it as a template for drilling the new board.  Well, I found a way around him and his bad business tactics to try and screw us out of more money. We made our own template using my mad measuring skills and now we have a perfect new diving board!  Mike lost our business and we are happy to never deal with them again. After many years of the Burketts doing a lot of business with Arizona Pool Stuff, they will never get another dime from us again!

Always have a blast at 3rd Thursday! As it if wasn't fun enough, just going for a run (especially in the heat of the summer), drinking a good beer after and hoping to win (though still haven't won a thing yet) in the raffle makes every 3rd Thursday worth it!
