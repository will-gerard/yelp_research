I've been going here since I was a toddler...literally. My first experience at Pho 43 Express was when I still needed a booster seat. I would probably say I was probably 4 at the time.   This is hands down...THE BEST PHO restaurant in Phoenix!. Period. It may be located in a not-so-pristine location, but if you're looking for a luxurious Vietnamese restaurant...then this isn't the place for you. Usually upscale Vietnamese restaurants in AZ feature the all-special...Americanized, bland, boring pho.  I can honestly say that I've never had a "bad" pho experience here. I'm sorry, but I haven't tried any of their other dishes, because I'm so addicted to the pho.  Be adventurous, try something else on the menu and let me know what you think. As for me, when I need a good pho fix...this is ALWAYS my go-to. :)

This place is a treasure in Old Town Scottsdale! Consider yourself lucky if you need a cheap lunch in Scottsdale because this is as good as it gets!   I LOVE their sushi and lunch specials. $3.95 for a full chicken terriyaki lunch, with salad!! I guess they don't believe in inflation? These prices cannot be found anywhere else...ESPECIALLY NOT in old town.   Their rolls are unbelievably cheap too! I had an order of oysters one day and it was...AMAZING! Once again...cheap oysters that are fresh and served on a plate of ice. What more can you ask for?

Ok, so their sushi isn't exactly Drop-dead-yummy sushi. HOWEVER, for the price, the sushi is pretty good! It's cheap, quick, and delicious. I've been here a few times with big and small groups and it works either way. Too big of a group might not work though. (It's a rotating sushi bar) so seating would be a little awkward in a big group.   You pick the sushi you want to eat off the belt and just grab it and eat it! The prices are based off of the color plates you have, which they total up at the end. Let's just say I myself ate 4 plates one time, and the bill was under $13.00!!! I think it was like 3 rolls of sushi and something else. Now try doing that at any other sushi place. NOT easy, right? :)  This is a great interactive place and wonderful with kids because they get to see and pick what they want to eat.

One of the best Vietnamese restaurants in AZ for sure! This is our family's go-to restaurant whenever we are craving "broken rice" or happen to be on the east side.   This is probably my mom's favorite place to eat regardless of the occasion. She's asked to come here for everything. Her birthday, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, etc. My mom is one of THE pickiest eaters I have EVER encountered, and if she likes a certain restaurant...that says A LOT!  The service is always good here. Much better than most Asian restaurants in AZ. I'm pretty sure I've had the same waiter everytime I've been there and he's always been great!  I always get the Com Tam Bi Suon Cha Tau Hu Ky and it's never disappointed. When I'm feeling like a little fatty, I'll do the 7 Mon /"All 7" and basically pay a little more to try a little bit of everything. That also means that I have to come with an empty stomach because...it's a whole lot of food!   I wouldn't suggest doing the 10 Mon/"All10" unless you were planning to either share it or take leftovers home. Their portions are rediculously large!   The pork chop is always grilled just right and their food flavoring is very consistent for the most part. Sometimes the broth is a little saltier than others, but for me...that doesn't really matter because I like the extra kick! :)  You can always ask them for a little bit of boiled water to make it less salty if you want.   This is a Vietnamese restaurant you don't want to pass up if you're ever in town. I know I don't. :p

I just realized that I've been here quite often in the past few months when I am back in AZ. It seems like Smashboxx is the new Asian Old Town Scottsdale hotspot. Back in the old days, (when I was still underage) it used to be Myst (which has now officially been closed down). Then the Asian crowd slowly immersed into Axis/Radius and now it's Dollhouse and Smashboxx.  All my friends hold their events here now because of the connections with the bartenders and club promoters.   It's never ever crossed my mind to write a review about a nightclub...until now.  This past weekend was probably the most fun I have had in a long time with all my friends. On top of that, the service was impeccable! The waitresses were HOTT and super sweet! They were helpful and not at all snobby. They were fun, energetic and made the atmosphere of our double birthday celebration even better! They were incredibly fast getting everyone drinks and we came as a huge group, so that says A LOT!  We had about 30 people there and even got a VIP table with a COMPLIMENTARY bottle!! Of course, everyone also bought drinks because there was so many of us. Everyone who came before 11pm entered through the side VIP line which was great because the regular line is incredibly long around that time. It took us less than 5 min to get through the door.   This is definitely a good venue for fun events with your friends. Kenny Wong is our go-to guy here and he's never let us down. Make sure you get in touch with him if you want to throw a party there.   Have fun!

If I could give no stars, I would have jumped at the idea. Unfortunately, 1 is the lowest on Yelp.   By far...the WORST Chinese/American restaurant one could ever venture to in Scottsdale or maybe even AZ.  My friend and I were meeting up for lunch and were going to go to Kyoto on Scottsdale but they were closed...so we had to pick another place close by. We ended up picking Jimmy Woo's. Worst decision EVER!  I had a lunch chicken dish there and it was so bad I don't even remember what it was even supposed to be. It was so bad I had to ask for soy sauce and a bunch of other sauces to have an edible lunch.  The chicken was overcooked and hard/dry...and there was VERY limited sauce on the plate...which didn't help the situation.  My recommendation: Don't go here if you want "Chinese food". Go here if you want bland, gross, Americanized mock Chinese food.

My best friend took me here for dinner since I was craving noodle soup. This hit the spot and satisfied my craving! Delicious Japanese Ramen!!!! Especially for AZ/Tempe!!! Definitely the best ramen in this state. Will surely be back for more! Make sure you ask for the spicy version since it's not on the menu and get pork belly and roasted garlic so the broth becomes more flavorful! I also ordered the soft egg with mine because I love eggs!
