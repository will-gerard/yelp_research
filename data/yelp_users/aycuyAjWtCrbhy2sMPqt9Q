So I've had five or six airbrush tans here and they've all been excellent. I've seen Laura, who is my favorite, and Jessica, who also does a great job. I've had three different color formulas applied too. I love that they're always ready to tweak the formula to meet my specific needs. Buying a package is definitely the smart way to go, I usually purchase the five for $100 deal. Twenty bucks for a flawless tan that lasts at least a week is a pretty great deal!

I always receive top notch service here. Pretty good beer selection and the garlic fries are addictive. My favorite bar on Mill. And in Tempe.

This is hands down the best Asian restaurant in the valley. Happy hour is from 4-7, seven days a week, with half price appetizers and drinks. Everything I've eaten here has been fantastic. The spicy shrimp and pork wontons and house roast pork are to die for. I'm coming in next week for the Peking duck.

I just sat for 17 minutes without anyone asking me if I wanted to drink. There are 20 other places on Mill that I could go and get good service, I won't be coming back.
