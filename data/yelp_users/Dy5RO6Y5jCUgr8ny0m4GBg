Not impressed, windows were smudged, water spots on both sides doors, windows, and top of my toyota. Way over priced for the quality. I went back next day to have the car touched up, no such luck. This business just lost my business. I even gave the employee 5 dollars when he finished my car later realized that they did a half aas job.

I really had high hope for the Groupon for 2 for 1 gel or shellac manicure. Let's just say I won't be returning.

I'm new to this side of town. I live within walking distance, added bonus (wink, wink). This is a great low key bar that's offers good drink specials. I do have to say the daytime one could feel out of place if not  a regular.   Great jukebox, one pool table, one dart board, about 4 tables inside, 16 barstools, and small smoking patio. I almost forgot don't go hungry they only sell chips.   Weekend nights get a little crowded.

I hate to say this but thos particular location has a poor selection. Not to mention it seemed the entire staff even the manager had attitude. I don't believe one customer in the store got greated by staff when they entered or exited the building. I'd rather take my business else where customers are welcome.

Wow this place is like a bad unorganized garage sale. Owners are rude, cash only. They have some electronics in box, broken, missing pieces. They have a dollar section items that may or may not be new. They have nice furniture way over priced.  This store would have potential if they took the time to organize and price items with stickers instead of markers. The store would be horders dream...

Cute store, great selection, friendly staff,  reasonable pricing. This is probally the best scrapbook store in Arizona. I have to say the scrap booking convention was an awesome experience. Paper Vineyard has the next best closest selection to the scrap book convention.... Thank you for the 20 for 30 deal, can honestly say I got alot of goodies for my money. :)   If you are into scrap booking I highly recomend checking this place out.

Definatly not Toyotta Arrowhead, miss the happy Chris Conger and the friendly smiling faces.  Not impressed, I have been going to Toyota Arrowhead for a year and half. The one time I was told next oil change I'll need brakes. Couple months later schedule to get brakes done. Surprised when my service guy Chris Conger told me I don't need brakes. Two oil changes later Chris said yep you need brakes. That's customer servics any female would appreciate.  Okay so now Riverview Toyota, not impressed. I was the first customer of the day. I arrived at 7 am. My 2010 toyota was not ready until 9 am. Did I mention my appointment was for an oil change.   So about 830 I'm told my car is ready. All the sudden I'm told I need new tires, a battery, back brake cleaning service, & a light by my license plate was out.  So I asked the service guy to show me why I need all these services. So he walked me to the service area, yep back brakes dusty, tires will need to be replaced within 10, 000 miles. Funny the battery tested average not high or low. Yep we live in AZ car battery's don't last long. As for the light bulb worked perfectly fine.   Girls watch out these service guys are closers, so they think. All I can say is if you maintain your bexhill it'll run forever. Lesson learned stock with the service/mechanic you trust. I've decided it worth the 45 minute drive to Arrowhead.   Thank you Riverside Toyota for confirming why I don't like dealerships.

I love the east side of Phoenix I swear they have cleaner grocery stores.  This particular frys has a good selection of produce, meat, and daily. The  store is user friendly, staff seems to always be smiling. I like that the staff is helpful, usually greats you with a smile.

Why would chase assign a personal banker for location I've never been too?? They asked me to come in to meet my personal banker. I get to the bank at 5 like I was asked. For my personal banker to tell me I have the right accounts. I'm not sure what I was expecting but thanks Chase for wasting my time.

Mislead about rental process....they took our application fee. We completed application process honestly. 3 weeks later found out that Gentry denied our application since my roomate didn't report a DUI from 2003.
