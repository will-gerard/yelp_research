We were at IHOP for Easter breakfast because our big plan for going to Matt's Big Breakfast was squashed when we drove by and discovered that they were closed that day. So, a little disappointed, we turned around and hit the IHOP on Central that we had passed 5 minutes before. We already knew the quality of the food would be fine, as all IHOPs are fairly consistent. But what impressed us was the friendliness and happiness of the staff that morning. We walked in and were cheerfully greeted by Anita at the front register. She looked around and seeing all the staff was busy, she bussed a table for us and sat us immediately. We were impressed right there. Then we were served by Kamal, who was super friendly, attentive and in a great mood. But it wasn't just the 2 people we had direct contact with. Must have been the Easter spirit or something, but the whole staff seemed to have smiles on their faces while we were there. We kept noticing and commenting to each other how odd it was to see happy restaurant staff (how sad is that?) I can't remember the last time my boyfriend and I went out for a meal and called the manager over to tell her that we were thrilled with the service. On a $22 check, we left $35. Well worth it.

We enjoyed our stay in our Hilton suite very much this past weekend. Very friendly front desk staff, although they were about the only ones we saw there. It was a ghost town! The room was exceptionally clean and beautifully upgraded. The king bed was luxurious to say the least. Wonderful sheets, down comforter, down pillows. The suite was a 550 square foot, one bedroom. It had everything you could want.  We didn't eat or drink in the hotel but the restaurant and bar looked nice. One odd thing was that there was an indoor pool (very nice btw) but a little disappointing because we were looking forward to getting some sun... which we did at a nearby hotel... Check out The Clarendon. Very cool. All in all, I'd stay here again with no hesitation.

I saw Jennifer Houston for a Dermaplaning treatment. I was impressed with the salon, the atmosphere and Jennifer's knowledge and expertise. The service was performed perfectly and I wouldn't hesitate to refer her! It's obvious that she is a very skilled aesthetician, but it's her warm and friendly personality that really puts you at ease immediately.

I've gone to Sakana for 12 years. When my friends or family come in from Seattle, it's where we have sushi. I can honestly say that I remember once or twice having something I didn't care for. Once or twice in 12 years is not a bad record. I think sometimes we have bad experiences and that's probably what happened to the two reviewers that hated the place because I've been referring sushi lovers to Sakana for a decade and no one has ever said they weren't impressed. Actually, my nephew once said that he preferred Sushi 101 on University because their nigiri were smaller and fit into your mouth better.  What kind of American is that? The portions at Sakana are pretty big, he does have a point... but I'm all about maximizing my buck and the quality has NEVER disappointed.  Try the salmon (NOT smoked) and the yellowtail nigiri. Melts in your mouth.

they do a good job but I have never been here for an oil change that didn't take more than an hour and a half... I  bought a group deal, so had to keep coming back, but  not the kind of time I can spend hanging out, waiting... waiting... Jiffy lube is closer and faster.

I love AJ  Flowers. It's in a little, 3 or 4-store strip mall, right off Ironwood Drive. The interior is quaint, and so tastfully decorated, it's very obvious that their staff has impeccable taste. I've become a regular.

I was impressed with the professionalism and attention to detail when I got my professional headshots done at Leasures Designer portraits. Even though they specialize in family portraits, all my individual pics came out beautifully. There were a few consultation appointments during the process to make sure everything was on track. I'll use them again in a hearbeat if I ever need more headshots done.

How can you tell if a business does a good job? If it's busy! I've only been to Aardbark 3 times but each time I go (middle of the day, weekday) it's packed. I love the 2 shop kitties... every business should have a couple mascots... and my cocker, who hates baths, at least likes to walk in the door and be greeted by the friendliest (and fattest) Siamese I've ever seen. They do a good job, don't cost much and are always friendly.

Non-greasy pizza, fan-frigging-tastic beer selection, and laid back atmosphere. It's our go-to place when we don' t know where we want to go.

I've been to Z-Cafe several times and each time I'm impressed. All the food is made fresh while you wait. I LOVE their burritos... the potatoes in them are so perfectly cooked and I'm SUCH a fan of their sandwiches, too. Good Boar's Head meats, but I think I like their bread the most! The salsa is great, although the hot one isn't really hot at all. I'm luck enuf to live very close, but even if you don't, the trip is worth it.

Oh, yes, I have to disagree with the nay-sayers. Spices is my regular Friday night place... the Sundried Tomato Soup is a must, although it's a bit warm to eat in the summer. The Aegean Salad is one of my faves, and so is the Chicken Shwarma. If you like it hot, you can have them make it spicy... it has quite a kick! I had never had Turkish Coffee before going there for the first time, and it's delicious, but word to the wise, don't drink it too late! Also, the stuffed grape leaves are awesome, very lemony.  Last week I tried the Garlic Potato Bourekas. My new favorite! As I understand, they're about the add a lot more items to the menu.

Well, i just have nothing bad to say about this place at all... The food was great (I'm picky about my jambalaya - and it was very good!) The pecan pie and calamari are also awesome! My boyfriend's from New orleans and is very familiar with Creole and Cajun. He was impressed! The restaurant is in a very hidden corner of Baseline and the 101 so it's not easy to see, but if you want to treat yourself with some good New Orleans fare, FIND IT! And have the Gumbo!

I was so pleased with my evening at The Dhaba. Their food was really good, their ambience was so much better than a lot of mom-and-pops and the neighboring shops are just charming. The grocery store next door had so many interesting foods and condiments. One thing that struck me was that no matter which box of prepackaged meals I picked up, the ingredient list was all of real food and spices... No ingredients you couldn't pronounce. What a novel idea... I'm excited to bring my Indian friend here. She and I have eaten at many Indian places around the valley and I really think she'll love this place. For dinner, I had the Ambala Tiki Chaat as an appetizer... wonderful! And Tikki Masala. As good as many I've had. And Lahori Malai Kofta which is a vegetarian substitute for meatballs. It consists of dumplings made out of paneer (cottage-cheese), cauliflower florets, carrots and potatoes in a rich and creamy sauce. I'd never had it before, but recommend it highly! I'll be back to The Dhaba again very soon!!

It's hard to totally screw up gyro meat. I've generally been pleased any time I've gotten a gyro. I went to George's Famous for the first time last week, and I was more than impressed. I got the Original and my boyfriend got the Gyro Picado, which is really spicy with all the peppers and jalapenos. Both were really good, HUGE and like I sad, the meat was great. Apparently they make a lot of their own stuff right there. The tzatziki was one of the best I've had. George suggested I get one of the other dishes that has a Vodka Alfredo sauce next time. He said it's a favorite of the regulars. I forget what dish it's supposed to come on, but I'm sure if you mentioned it, he'd know! I'll definitely be back.

I'm from the Northwest and have always loved clam chowder and really anything seafood. Whale's seafood chowder is excellent, very  tasty and thick... not like some that are watered... uh, MILKED down. We also ordered the special of the day, a grilled veggie sandwich. Really good. And the BBQ bacon wrapped shrimp were to die for.  We were also impressed by the friendliness of the staff. Bruce, the owner, talked to us for a while and the bar manager (I think), Mike, was a cool guy who obviously knows his way around a restaurant and came over to chat a few times. I was impressed by the food, the service and the staff. That's quite enough to bring me back very soon!

Not your typical greasy, fat-laden pizza. I've tried the White, Works and Veggie. All were made with very fresh ingredients. If all you've had is Papa Johns (it's been sucking lately) and other delivery-style pies, and are interested in trying pizza with a "cleaner" taste, give them a try.

I've taken 4 classes at Express MiE and LOVE the place. As a matter of fact, I'm going to be signing up for an unlimited membership today. Loved the Hula Hoop class... btw, a heck of a lot harder than it used to be when I was 6, and I had a couple small bruises the next day  :) There are so many kinds of classes, much more than any gym I know of. I can't think of a better way of getting my body moving after years of slacking on the exercise front! Another thing I really loved is the friendliness of the staff. You know how you can sometimes detect a whiff of superiority in a fitness center or gym? There was no pretentiousness at all here. Very nice. I'd recommend MiE to anyone, but especially if you're a little gun shy about going to a gym. It's more pricey, for sure, than a gym but has so much else to offer. There's also an introductory price for the first month unlimited so it's easier on the wallet to try it first...

Here's what $152 a night got us... no coffee maker, no extra bed linens for the sofa bed, a mini fridge that apparently works on a timer because it wasn't on when we woke up and all our food was warm, no plates or utensils in the kitchen, no robes, no dvd player. The look of the hotel is beautiful but the virtual tour online is not the same as the room we got, which was a lot smaller. Totally disappointing stay. I won't be back for this kind of $. This is an update to my comments above: the reason that we don't have a coffee maker in the room is that the rooms don't come with them. I mean, even motel 8 has coffee makers! AND in order to have maid service, you have to give 24 hours notice and pay an extra $45. That would have been good to know BEFORE 4pm the day before we checked out.

I like tempe vet a lot. I've been there a dozen times between a sick cat and old dog. The only reason they don't get 5 stars from me is that I've never been there and not waited 20 minutes to see the doctor. But I've had many positive experiences with Dr. Wells and overall I'm very happy that I take my animals there.
