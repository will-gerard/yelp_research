I don't think I could say enough good things about Ray and the business he runs.  He is so honest, reliable, knowledgeable, friendly and an all around great guy.  I presented him with what I had been told was an expensive transmission problem, and he took his time to examine every aspect of my car and run every diagnostic test and found absolutely nothing wrong with my tranny.  Ray was absolutely fantastic and I wouldn't hesitate to send anyone I knew his way.

5 Stars doesn't even do this place justice, but I suppose that's why it's a 5 DIAMOND restaurant! We came here for my bf's bday on Tues and we still haven't stopped talking about our meal!  He said it was hands down the best meal he's had in his life...and I'm leaning towards agreeing.  Started with the Caviar and Foie app...um, what's NOT to like? He had the Venison...BEST venison we have ever had...ever I had the Escargot with Truffles...so nice to see escargot not drowned in garlic butter...love that too, but so refreshing to see a different take. Shared a fab bottle of Pinot Noir from the Santa Lucia Highlands Complimentary glasses of Veuve Cliquot and a berry plate (we don't do desserts) in honor of my bf's bday  Service was so phenomenal...really taking the dining experience to the next level.  Absolutely worth the drive out there and cannot wait to go back!  Tip...the views of the mountains are gorgeous!  We're normally not early eaters, but taking the early reservation was worth it to see the fiery skies and the sun sinking down into the mountains.

I dream about their chopped salad...I, too, would use it as my screen saver if I didn't share a computer.

Yes, there's a wait...but it's part of the experience!  I adore everything about this place...the pizzas (I've never had anything like the Biancoverde), the beer (it takes pizza and beer to soaring heights) and of course...Bar Bianco (who doesn't love wine/beer and appetizers as they anticipate their pizza??)  Chris and his incredible staff are always so welcoming, and I always leave a very happy girl!

Just had an excellent experience with Jerry! On time AND solved our problem in one shot when it took 4 previous companies to fix our Trane AC. Would def recommend to anyone with confidence!

Awful.   Terrible.   Horrible.   My hair was ruined.   DO NOT GO HERE.   Went in for a trim...one inch...soooooo hard to mess up...yet it was accomplished.   MCKENZIE ruined my hair.   She cut "layers" 2 inches from my scalp. My hair is LONG. How did this happen???? Didn't tell me and styled it to cover it.   THIS WILL TAKE YEARS TO GROW BACK.   Save yourself.   Do  Not  Ever  Go  Here  There is NOTHING that can be done to fix it.   Not worth a star. I am literally sick over this and have not stopped crying yet.

My hair still looks awful thanks to the butcher McKenzie.   The owner did NOT handle the situation well when I went into the "salon" (aka, ghetto strip mall location, do not be fooled by the pictures). She just kept telling me she couldn't make my hair grow back...obviously.   Please save yourself and learn from my mistake.  This place should be ashamed to call themselves a business. Look at my pictures of the hack job and see for yourself.  Somehow they got the LEGITIMATE picture I posted removed from their page...a shame really because I'm sure it'll happen again.

I've been seeing Lauretta for a few months now, and she has been nothing short of excellent! She uses only the best products which produce the best results! She's so sweet and professional, great skin rules and so does she!

Bad experience. After purchasing a LivingSocial deal for a dermaplane, Faith suggested a chemical peel and microderm instead. Fine.   1. Burning solution in my eye. Had to neutralize with drops. Eye was red all day.  2.  As my eye was on fire, she kept trying to sell me on eyelash extensions. Bad timing. 3.  The end result, 2 raw patches on my face and a red eye.  4.  Oh wait, not the end...awful reaction. Two raw patches and break out. 5.  Contacted Faith, she said she would fix it when I healed and do a dermaplane for no charge.  3 weeks later I contacted her again, she told me I should see a dermatologist instead.  No apology.  6.  Fast forward 2 months. My skin is almost back to normal...minus a couple of scars.   There are so many better places in Scottsdale. Try somewhere else.

Came out the same day to inspect and treated the entire home the following day.  Could not be more pleased with the service and warranty.  Prices were incredibly reasonable.  Highly recommend to anyone.

Met Robert Wholey...wholey sweet talker :)   Started with the highly recommended Lobster Bisque Fries (complimentary with a Yelp check in!) and a couple chocolate cr√®me stouts. The fries? My new favorite way to eat them. Move over truffle fries, lobster bisque is the way to go.   I had the blue crab salad, while my bf's mom ordered the shrimp and scallops. Salad had a ton of crab...def couldn't finish. Bf's mom's order was delivered with sweet soy instead of lobster beurre blanc, and quickly corrected.   All in all, a super cute place in the heart of the Strip District with good food. Win.

Have already reported and filed complaints to Allergan and the Arizona Naturopathic Doctors.   Save  your  face. Holy over injecting. Frozen is a movie...not what I asked for. I'm so mad right now, but you'd never know, I can't show emotion. Plus my eyebrows are uneven. Thanks.   Stay away. Sleazy sales pitch after sleazy sales pitch. Am I at a medspa or a dirty used car lot? More Botox? No. Lasers? No. Facials? No. Over priced Membership package? NO. Syringes of Botox? N-O. More Botox?!?! Whoa. Are you serious?! Should have walked out then.   Shady. Outdoor sign says Botox $9/unit. Tried to charge me $14/unit. #baitandswitch  Unethical. Complained to owner, she said staff would reach out and apologize. No call. Follow up. Follow up. I get it, you got my money and I'm never stepping foot in that hell hole again, so I don't matter.   But wait, a voicemail...an awful/condescending voicemail from a manager  rudely stating that she will not apologize.   Figures. Can't teach class.

Couldn't be happier with the work Irena does. Everything she tailored for me was impeccable. She is also a perfectionist (which I appreciate!) I asked her to reconstruct a skirt, and when I tried it on, she wasn't completely satisfied, she remarked and took it back to work on it some more.   Definitely will not be going anywhere else for tailoring.   Seriously though, fit is so key in clothing. Spend an extra $10-$15 and you can make anything look amazing and perfect for you.
