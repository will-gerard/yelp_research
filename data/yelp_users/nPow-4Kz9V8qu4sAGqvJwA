I only want to write a review to give Phil, the bartender a shout out. He is awesome and always on top of his game! Other than that, Ztejas is amazing. I have loved everything on the menu! Great chicken, burgers, pasta, tacos, salad, and burritos!

I love Barros but this location is horrible. I placed an order over the phone for 12 wings and garlic bread. They told me 15 minutes. I arrived, paid, and they said it would be a few more minutes. 45 minutes later the gal asked what the name was again and realized my food had been sitting there the entire time. Her response.. "Oops." My food was cold & disgusting. I didn't eat it. Will never be back.
