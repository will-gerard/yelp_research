I can't find it in me to give this place more than two stars.  The atmosphere is not bad, pretty much expected for a wine bar.  However there are some tacky elements... our high-top table and both stools were annoyingly wobbly, and a member of the waitstaff was sitting at a computer using Facebook at the bar (klassy).  The service was terrible... to the point where we were ready to walk out if the waiter made one more trip past our table without so much as eye contact.  We walked to the bar for our second round of drinks after waiting with empty glasses for about 15 minutes (the same amount of time it took us to get our first round).  When the waiter to patron ratio is about 1:1, you'd expect a lot more...  I'm sticking to Postino.

Its a decent New York-esque Jewish bakery.  I want so badly to love it 5-star-style, but unfortunately a lot of their stuff seems to be kind of dry.  The nice part is they have free samples of just about everything, so at least you know what you're getting.  And they are totally fine with you making a meal out of the samples.  The service is awesome and the prices are what they should be for a bakery.    I've gone here a few times since moving to AZ and will definitely be back.  Go for the rugelach or the onion rolls!

Walking into this place is just plain confusing.  You could tell it used to be something different, but I've got no idea what.  I guess it doesn't matter.  It just sort of looks cheap.  But that's ok.  The food was right on, and I'll be back for more.  Bento Box A?  Yes please.  Small salad with a great ginger-type dressing, some sort of spicy beef, teriyaki chicken, rice, egg roll, some edamame, a few carrots... am I missing anything?    The service was great, the food even better, and it only set me back about 5 minutes and 8 bucks.  It seems like a sure bet, and close enough to work for a good take out that it will rise toward the top of my list.

I'm surprised how well this deli is reviewed... I've given it about 5 chances now.  It always looks promising, and is right next door to the Jewish bakery which I love.  Unfortunately, I've been pretty let down each time I've tried to grab some good food from Scott's.  The service is terrible, at least for take-out.  They take their time and acknowledge you if they feel like it.  I don't know about dine-in service, but you can tell having a smile would get a waitress fired.  As for the food... potato knishs looked outstanding, tasted like something you could buy frozen.  Bagels were okay but I had the bar raised.  Scallion cream cheese left a lot to be desired, which is sad because I consider a good everything bagel with scallion cream cheese to be the ultimate new york breakfast treat (after a good egg sandwich, of course).  Damn, the egg sandwich was awful that one time... did they get their bacon from Wendy's?  Still looking for a good NY deli, so feel free to pass one on!  Wish it could have been Scott's.

Yelp probably isn't the place you'd look for a dentist, but I'm glad Amy posted a good review because that's what brought me into Dr. Radcliffe's office.  I've never been happier with a dentist.  I like to say that a dentist is only as good as his reception staff, and sometimes a bad front office ruins the best dentist.  Not the case here -- the staff is as awesome as the dentist.  And the office is awesome as well, bright and modern the way it should be.  Dr. Radcliffe is very approachable... extremely nice and quite good at what he does.  He treats you like a member of the family.   It sounds weird to say, but I don't dread going back (and I'm not worried when it's time, because they've always gotten me in whenever I wanted)!

This place is great!  I had a pair of pants that needed to be taken up and they were quick to help.  I needed them in a pinch and they got them done, and done well.  Everyone here is extremely friendly, and makes you feel like family.  They even sewed on a new button for my shirt while I was dropping my pants off.  If you need any alterations (or Creations for that matter), this is the place to go!  They are cash only, but there's a Chase across the street if you need it.

You would just think with a name like Mr. Submarine that this would be the place to go for a submarine.  Sad to say, I'd totally opt for Subway.  The prices are reasonable but the choices are slim.  We're talking ham, turkey, Italian, that's about it.  I believe my sandwich came with the equivalent of one slice of deli meat.    If I had to pick a word to describe this place it would be lackluster.  Nothing special whatsoever.  They didn't even have any bread selection, if I remember correctly you could chose between white or wheat.  Which is the selection I had as a child, before people cared about bread.    A lazy, hungover mother could make a better sandwich for her kid to take to school in the morning... I know, because mine did all the time.  And we never called her Mr. Submarine, at least not that I can remember.

Winner.  You want healthy?  You got it. You want vegetarian/vegan?  You got it. You want your food to taste amazing?  You got it. Service?  You guessed it.  A spicy cha cha might sound like something you might want to avoid, but don't look over this menu item at Loving Hut.  I don't even remember what was in it, and frankly I don't care... it was simply amazing.  Start with a variety of the spring/summer/egg rolls and get a few different dishes, because you're going to want to try as many as possible.  Next time I will definitely start with dessert.  I could see how you'd always end up too full after dinner, but they look too amazing to miss.

I'd been craving Cuban food ever since I left Florida, and I couldn't have been more thrilled after our meal at Havana Cafe.  I wouldn't sit inside, as the atmosphere kind of sucks, but the patio was great in the recently-awesome weather.  The service was great... the waiter knew the menu inside and out, had great recommendations, and was the guy who remembers your order without a pad and somehow doesn't screw it up.  Sangria-Delicious Mojitos-Same Seviche (spelled that way) -Ditto Gambas y Pollo-See Above Pumpkin Soup (seasonal)-Best I've Had  The bad - I think they are pretty over-priced for Cuban food.  Don't get me wrong, the food is great, but I don't think Cuban food should fall in the $20/plate range.  You need a key to get into the restrooms, which makes it feel kind of like a gas station.  You also get a feel that most male customers just go behind the dumpsters, not that I did that...    This place would have been an easy 5-stars except for one thing, that totally blew the experience.  The waiter automatically added a 20% tip to the bill, on top of tax.  Ordinarily he would have earned it.  But when questioned, he said they always do that on large parties.  We were a party of 5.  He was extremely arrogant about it, saying nobody's ever questioned it.  Totally ruined the whole evening.  And of course, there was no mention of an auto-tip on the menu, go figure.  I could understand if there were 10 of us, you get it.  Overall, I would be excited to go back again.  It's a great place to go if you are craving some pretty good authentic food in the valley that isn't Mexican.  Grab a $28 pitcher of sangria and/or a few mojitos, splurge on some appetizers, and go for just about anything on the menu.  Nobody in our group left disappointed, with the food at least.

This is the place to go to grab a drink with out-of-town visitors, hands down.    The restaurant is what it is, look to spend over $100 a person and stop at McDonald's on the way home to fill up.  If you have the money, or need a place for a fancy occasion, don't hesitate.  The service was great and the food delicious (at 5-star portions).  The great thing: you can get domestic bottled beer for $5, and some cocktails (including Bacardi) for $7.  My advice is to head into the bar, grab a drink, and find a spot at a table or couch outside.  You can see the entire valley, and relax by their fire pit/water feature.  Sunset is the best, although I'd recommend a drink before dark and another after.  In all fairness, they could charge you $10 just to come take a peek at their view, and you'd gladly oblige.  It's a great place to take photos, or maybe somebody you want to marry.  I'll stick to drinks, and you better bet you'll see me outside any time someone comes to visit!

The scene is definitely better than the food, but I have to give it 4-stars for the happy hour menu.  In total they have over 20 items to choose from - sushi and appetizers, most under $5.  I believe it runs from 3p-7p.  Good looking wait staff and a nice decor.    Agreed - walking around Kierland is a nice way to work off lunch, or perhaps across the street to the Westin.  We'll be back for happy hour again!

I'm all about dive bars, but this one just kind of sucked.  The bartender wasn't at all friendly or interested in helping us.  The decorations were weird, even for Christmas.  The place had no special feeling whatsoever, so I won't go back.  Oh, and cash only.

The bad: the bar closes at 10pm.  It seems like the western, country, wagon-wheel themed bar that you'd like to close down one night while playing some good tunes on the juke box and eating peanuts.  And also the french fries, file those under bad.  The good: the hamburgers are pretty much delicious.  Definitely go for guacamole, and add whatever you want from the topping wagon.  I didn't try one myself, but I hear the cookies are good.

I'd give this place an extra half star if I could, just because it used to be a Wendy's.  I think this is probably as close to "authentic" as you're going to find.  They have all the usual suspects of a Mexican joint: tacos, quesadillas, and of course the salsa bar (I think this was a remnant of when Wendy's had salad bars, remember that?  circa early 1990s).  The service is good, and the food is delicious.  I would suggest a giant (and they are giant) chicken quesadilla, with a bunch of guacamole on the side.  The cheese is melty and delicous!  I would avoid the steak as it is quite tough, but to be fair I've never had good steak from a good mexican restaurant.  And they have Mexican Coke in glass bottles, which usually always makes me go back for more.

I was going to give Maxim 4 stars, but I have a hard time holding out if I can't think of a good reason.  And in this case I just couldn't.  Don't hold the neighborhood against them... if you're from Phoenix, you know 19th and Osborn isn't the fanciest.  But then again, when was the last time you ate amazing Vietnamese food at the Biltmore?  An obvious choice is the Pho, and I have to admit I went safe with white meat chicken.  There was no skimping here... a huge to-go cup of broth, and an overflowing container of chicken, noodles, sprouts, veggies and herbs.  There's probably a method to eating it, but I just shoved it all in the cup and gorged.  And I couldn't be happier.  For some carbs and goodness I tacked on 2 egg rolls - a delicious mix of pork and shrimp.  They rank at the top of my best-egg-rolls-ever list.  I read a few things below about not-so-good service, and I'm having a hard time believing it was the same restaurant.  The lady who took my order was very receptive and made some great suggestions (including not being too exploratory with my food on my first visit).  Everyone in the place was smiling.  For a total of $8, I ended up with 2 full meals and a happy tummy.  And it doesn't hurt that I work right around the corner.  Glad I found this place!  Oh side note, I did find a Styrofoam cup in the parking lot that someone wrote "Die Bitch" on.  The neighborhood isn't great.  But the food's amazing, so get over it!

Da Vang is 5-star food at traditional, 1-star prices.  I've never spent more than $10 here, and that usually includes at least one appetizer or dessert.  The service is the best I've had at a Vietnamese place.  Sure, there might be a pretty thick language barrier, but it's never gotten in the way of finding the perfect dish or having the order come out exactly as expected.  Of course I'd recommend getting some Pho (stick with chicken unless you're either very adventurous or completely sure what the other ingredients are).  You can also keep it simple and delicious by getting a BBQ pork sandwich, like I almost always do (and if you really want to be like me, make sure to tell them no mayo).  But seriously, if you take one thing away from this review - TRY DESSERT.  I'm not a fan of the spongy-green cakey things, but the deserts in the cooler are usually very good.  I'd recommend any of the coconut-milk-based concoctions in the plastic cups.  Ask for a cup of crushed ice, pour the dessert on top, and enjoy.  Don't be freaked out - there will likely be some sort of beans, maybe seaweed, who knows what - but it will be delicious.  Did I mention the people here are awesome?  Great food, great service, and your wallet won't be sore the next day (neither will your stomach).

If one star means "Eek! Methinks not," then one star it is.  I'm not even sure what I got from here was food!   The outside is shady indeed, the inside is in fact shadier, and the food and service... you get the idea.  I ordered the beef and broccoli lunch which included fried rice - a safe bet at any Chinese place.  What I ended up with seemed like some sort of gelatinized beef fat... at least I hope.  If it wasn't fat, I have no clue what it was.  And the fried rice looked something like rice, but I don't even know how to describe what it tasted like.  Needless to say, I didn't take 3 bites of the plate before throwing it out.  And I kind of feel sick just thinking about it.  I haven't found a great Chinese place in Phoenix yet, but I can guarantee you I'd avoid even driving past this place -- and I suggest you do the same.

Welcome to the family. You truly feel like you are in a Bosnian home when you are here, although it's not a scary place. Inside at least.   Service - top notch. There's a small language barrier that makes ordering fun, and sort of surprising.  Food - must try. Go with a small group and just order everything. The food was admittedly too greasy on our second visit, but I'm still going back. The spinach thing is awesome, the sandwich "bread" is like none other, and the red sauce/dip is just awesome.   Go, now!

Lon's was a complete bust.  Mom took me for a "nice" Christmas dinner.  We succeeded on atmosphere, but that was about it.  While the service was just okay, the food was just terrible.  Keep in mind this was a Christmas Day prix fixe menu at $68/pp, which by Phoenix standards should be the best meal I've had all year.  Appetizers - some sort of sushi thing that was drowned in seaweed, tasted okay but was barely noticeable on the plate.  Also a lobster cake which was okay, came out cold, and wasn't nearly as good as the worst crab cake I've ever had.  Entrees - prime rib came out cold, and I've had better at a cheap buffet carving station.  Veal scallopini was chewy (kind of like a microwaved sponge), and had the most tasteless mozzarella cheese I've ever had.  When we brought this to the attention of the waitress, she asked that they remake all of our food.  About a half hour later we got a better (still not good) version of the veal, and opted to try the ravioli instead of the prime rib they had run out of.  At least the veal came out hot this time.  The ravioli wasn't bad, but probably had more oil than any other ingredient.  I felt greasy after eating it, which was a shame.  Neither of our meals seemed to have any inspiration or fresh ingredients whatsoever.  Desserts - what a sin.  I wonder if this place pays a pastry chef?  I'm spoiled by my step mom's bread pudding, so I understand when others don't step up to the plate, but the bread pudding here is something I would never waste a calorie on again.  And my "apple pie" was simply a joke.  It was clearly canned filling that they didn't even bother to heat, stuffed inside a dry pie shell that tasted like a mouth full of flour.  Ugh!  Our waitress sent the manager over, and he initially came off as unapologetic and insulted that we were unhappy.  He had to go to the table right next to us a few minutes later.  After we waited 20 minutes for our check, he came back again in a slightly better mood.  He explained that the kitchen was tired after being there since the morning and had lost their creativity.  OK I get it, I was tired too, but what kind of creativity do you need to heat up an unimaginative, standard menu?  The night ended with our two glasses of wine and one of our two meals comped.  It was the right thing to do, although I still don't feel like we received nearly a $70 meal.  With so many other locally-focused and inspired restaurants all over the valley, I would certainly recommend against dinner at Lon's.  If I were to go back, it would only be for a glass of wine out on the patio (although I can list a few places I'd rather go for that, too).

I'm surprised to read some of the other reviews here... I'm from New York and know good Italian when I eat it.  This place IS good Italian.  The Veal Parm and garlic bread both stood out, and I loved the sauce... something I don't often find myself saying.  The pasta fagioli was also quite delicious.  Of course, I think the home made tiramisu was probably my favorite, though I'm a sucker for sweets.  Good service, good authentic atmosphere, and a few tacky signs and menu reminders give off the charm you'd expect of a great, neighborhood Italian place.  All in all, we left around $50 with an appetizer, two entrees, and dessert.  And we felt like we got the "great" birthday dinner we were in search of.

I'm from New York, so you can bet the firs thing I asked everyone when I moved to Phoenix was "where should I get some good pizza?"  Everyone responded "Pizzeria Bianco!," but a few wise ones told me to avoid the crazy wait and check out Cibo.  Still haven't made it to Bianco, but why bother?  I've been to Cibo 3 times in the past few months and wouldn't have it any other way.  The service has always been spectacular.  There's a good selection of beer and wine, and an almost impossible-to-choose-from selection of pizzas.  We're not talking New York thin-slice sauce-and-cheese, we're talking locally sourced ingredients and artful combination.  Perfect crust topped with the perfect combination of delicious meats, cheeses, and veggies galore.  Your least favorite part of the meal will definitely be trying to pronounce the names of the pizzas.  Your favorite part of the meal might be the pizza, or it might be the ambiance (hard to decide between the cozy outside with live music and fire pit or the quaint inside that boasts everything downtown Phoenix is good at).    Go with a group of friends and stay a while.

Tried Asi Es La Vida for lunch today for the first time, and was not disappointed.    I can't wait to go back for a "nice" dinner... the vibe in this place is great, very colorful and cozy.  I don't really get a cheap feel at all, although I suppose the place could be considered slightly confused.    I got the enchilada lunch special, which was surprisingly good.  It didn't come with the same nasty red sauce you get on enchiladas elsewhere, and it definitely had a unique flavor.  The best, however, was their cilantro soup.  Amazing!  I am definitely going to attempt recreating this at home, but I suspect I will be back to buy some more next week.  If this place is in fact BYOB, sign me up!

So the update is, dinner is even more amazing than lunch.  And then we went back again for lunch, and it was even more amazing than dinner.  The service is purely unbeatable, and the food is right up there with the service.  At this point, I would just get the chef special or whatever the waitress recommends, because I've never been let down.  And definitely get the pineapple juice.  All you can drink for $2.50, fresh and delicious.  And the guacamole?  I'll let you try that for yourself, let's just say it might be better than my own.

Mu Shu is the go-to place for lunch/dinner take out.    They have a menu, but why would you bother?  The build-your-own stir fry is the way to go.  Take your choice of chicken, shrimp, and whatever else they have... choices of sauce (go for the spicy garlic), and noodles, white or brown rice.  Then grab a bowl and stuff in as many veggies as you can.  The veggie bar is immaculate, and you can tell they use the freshest ingredients: onions, broccoli, bean sprouts, watercress, kale, tofu, green peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, and probably 5 others I got.  I usually go with chicken, light spicy garlic sauce, and white rice.  It runs me about $7, and I end up saving half of it for a second meal.  The take-out service is super quick, and the staff couldn't be friendly.  It only took two take-outs to become a regular.  Be sure to ask for a stir-fry card (I believe its 11th one free), as you will be using it!

I'm sad it's taken me over a year of living just down the road to finally make it to Bobby Q.  I think it was because I moved from Florida, where BBQ is delicious and cheap, and I was reluctant to "splurge" on pulled pork at a place like this.    The ambiance is fantastic, you feel great walking in.  The last star was left off for service, which I wasn't a huge fan of.  We were attended to just fine, but I wasn't a fan of our waiter's demeanor.  He didn't seem to know the menu well, which is a shame because it isn't huge.  I kind of felt like he was reading a script, emphasizing the whole "smoked for 18 hours" thing, which rubbed me the wrong way.  But aside from the waiter not being invited to my Christmas party, the place was great.  The food was really delicious, and well worth the money.  I believe that with an appetizer, any 2 people could easily share any entree.    I do have to say this - if you go, do NOT skip out on the banana dessert.  OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I am a freak for banana pudding, but this treat is on a whole new level.  It was thick and custardy, cold and delicious.  The best part was the crust, which was almost granola-esque.  I've never had anything like it, and doubt I ever will... until I go back to Bobby Q for some more!

This is another great place on what is becoming a great intersection for drinks - 16th St and Bethany Home.  I love it.  I've never been here for food, but I'm looking forward to it.  I like that you kind of eat and drink at the bar, and the bathroom is hidden somewhere in the kitchen.  And I also like that there isn't a sign outside and you just have to know where the place is.  Drinks are of good price considering the warm, upscale(ish) atmosphere of the place.  They also have a happy hour, during which you get a free snack-sized piece of food alongside your discounted drinks.  At last check they did a reverse happy hour also, which I'm a sucker for.  Why the minus-1 star?  I took a very large group of people on a bar crawl through my favorite intersection, and Dick's Hideaway was one of the stops.  We literally filled the place.  I accidentally broke a Stella glass (the true form of accident, not the drunk kind), and the bartender was pretty rude about it.  But that won't stop me from going back.

I would say Fuego Bistro's specialty is, well, everything.  Stand-up service, great lunch/happy hour selection and pricing, awesome patio setup, and some of the best Latin food I've eaten.  The waitstaff will definitely remember your name if you come back (and trust me, you will).  The mojitos are certainly delicious (blood orange for sure), but I would go for the sangria.  I like the red, but I hear the white is delicious as well, although a little sweet for me.  Pernil Asado is a sure pick, as is the dish with the mole should they put it on special again.  I'd eat and drink just about anything on the menu, and I'd be sure to leave full, drunk, and without a huge hold in my wallet!  Thanks, Fuego Bistro, I wish I found you sooner!  PS - they are on Restaurant.com, and they have a pretty lenient coupon-use policy if you're cheap like me.

I've heard about the Lost Leaf for a while, so I was glad to finally stop in... once we found it.  This is definitely a place you don't know about, unless you know about it.  The vibe works for me.  And since skinny jeans seem to be the common thread of complaints for the place, let it be known that I don't wear them either, and I felt just as comfortable there.  The atmosphere is great - dark and homey, but plenty of light to bring out the art and historic value of the home.  The bar is indeed the "kitchen," and while I wouldn't say their beer selection is world-renowned, it is certainly expansive and reasonably priced.  I intend to go here many more times, and never have a beer I've had before.  If you don't like beer, there's no reason to complain... they have plenty of Lambics and also some fruity girl drinks that come in a bottle.  Live music definitely was great on the night we were there.  Loud, yes, but definitely something I can appreciate!    See you next time, if we can find you...

Wow, Monkey Pants, you really let me down.  I've heard so many great things, from Yelp and from friends, and I couldn't wait to check this place out.  I finally did, and was honestly very surprised at how much I didn't like this place.  So the basics... you can usually get 2 out of 3 on service, price, and quality.  Well the service sucked.  The waitress was literally angry we were there.  The prices were ok.  Quality?  When your coke doesn't taste like coke (we're talking about soda here), the lemonade doesn't taste like lemonade, and the nachos seem like they've been prepared a few hours ago... not my place.  The decor confused me.  It seemed like they wanted to try for a sports restaurant, with a ton of TVs, but the TVs were fighting with the grandma's living room section.  I didn't feel the vibe, in fact I felt the desire to go home.  They have a free comedy show on Thursday nights as well.  The MC kept reminding us that you get what you pay for, but he must have been lying because they didn't pay me to sit through it.  Just about nothing offends me, but these "comedians" had offense on lock.  Jokes about rape and abortion, one after another, and nobody was laughing - time to give it up.

I'm not one to tear a place apart...  Sorry Wah Sun, you asked for it.  Normally, walking into a place that has all tables and no counters, no "actual" menus, only takes cash, and is run by an angry Chinese woman armed with an adding machine is a good sign -- seriously.  I'm all about no-frills authentic.  So I had high hopes, especially eating here on a recommendation.  Long story short, we kind of planned on getting stabbed by the worker for asking questions.  Don't ask what comes with anything, what kind of sauce, etc.  At Wah Sun, this should be common knowledge.  Anyway, the food took forever, and the place smelled like it was about to burn down, or had already partially burned down recently.  They don't take cards, no big deal.  We got screamed at a few times and ran away with our food, hoping for the best and receiving the worst.  All the food tasted like fish, and fish only.  Unfortunately none of us ordered fish.  Even the rice tasted like fish... not good sushi taste, but heated-up-in-the-sun fish juice from a dirty street fish taste.  Usually you can wash it down with an egg roll, but I think that's what they used to create that fire scene mentioned above.  It was like a black log.  Four of us got take out, four of us did NOT order fish, four of us wanted to vomit, four of us did, and four of us would have had to call in sick the next day if we hadn't been off.  Wah Sun?  Skip it.

The lentil soup is the star of this restaurant.  I wish they sold it by the gallon.  You could say Fattoush is kind of a hole in the wall, which I appreciate in an ethnic restaurant.  The decor is eclectic and seems to embody the spirit of the family owners.  If you expect fancy you may be disappointed, but if you expect a delicious meal at a fair price you'll be headed back for more.  Tonight I had the Chicken Shawarma sandwich (seasoned and served in a pita with tomatoes, pickles, and sauce) which, served with soup or salad at $6.95, was a steal.  And the tiny cup of Turkish coffee was just right.  The service is good and definitely very friendly.   Fattoush fits right in on that magical stretch of 19th Ave. between Indian School and Camelback, among so many great diverse food spots.

Are you kidding me?  This concept is a joke at best.  I have yet to see the convenience in taking the light rail, unless you both live and work within walking distance.  Connections to buses are not convenient, including the connection to the airport.  What is normally a 15-minute car ride to the airport turned into a 2-hour light rail, bus, bus fiasco, with a whole lot of sitting and waiting.  You can totally take the rail for free, which I bet most people do.  I don't really see the point since it is basically a double-bus on tracks.  It has to stop for traffic lights and never seems to get over 30mph.  Lame!

I'm guessing they turned this place around again, based on previous reviews.  We went here the other morning and it was great.  Awesome, friendly barista, and a good atmosphere overall.  Nice places to sit both inside and outside.  I think the most awesome part is they serve Almond Milk!  Woohoo!  My Veggie Panini was as delicious as described, and the coffee was just shy of perfect.

St. Francis wins best french fries in all of Phoenix, hands down.  Their sister restaurant at the Downtown Public Market seems to have the recipe, but can't quite match up.  St. Francis remains a favorite brunch spot (great live music starts at 10:30am Sundays), and performs just as well for dinner.  The service is always on par and the food is consistently delicious.  Go for their breakfast sandwich, sans mayo-sauce (come on, quit being fancy - no matter what you call it, may doesn't belong on a breakfast sandwich).  Their flat bread pizzas and burgers are always a good call at dinner time.  Did I mention happy hour?  The bar scene here is small, but if you can grab one of the outdoor stools, you'll be happy for quite some time.

I'm giving this place 4 stars for two reasons.  1. I am reviewing the Rum Bar, and not the restaurant (else the rating would go down). 2. I am writing this review after my last experience with a less-than-stellar bartender.  So let's start with the bad.  First, I think Rum Bar's popularity is outgrowing their space.  Which isn't a bad thing.  We just didn't have enough room to chill the other night.  No big deal.  More importantly, I've seen three bartenders at Rum Bar.  I believe Beth and Dwayne were the first to bartenders I've dealt with, and to say they are amazing and know their stuff is an understatement.  They know their rum (all 108 or so varieties).  They know their cigars, and damn it they know how to make a good drink.  Unfortunately, their work is overshadowed by the new guy whose name I never learned.  His drinks weren't bad, but his abruptness, cockiness, and attitude sucked all the magic out of the place.    OK, enough of the bad... now to the good.  The atmosphere, although small, is great.  A nice dimly lit cozy bar area is a good place to cool off or warm up, depending on the season.  But if its summer, or otherwise nice out, hit up some of the many Adirondack chairs and benches outside.  If it's a little warm the misters will overtake the patio in a good way.  But seriously, the RUM is responsible for half the namesake of this downtown gem.  Get some.  Any of their specialty cocktails listed on the menu are expertly created.  Never too sweet, never too strong... you will taste the alcohol and the complete essence of the drink.  Not sure what you want?  Snag one of those two awesome bartenders (who double as servers within the bar and patio) and tell them what's on your mind.  Branch out, try something new!  See you at the Rum Bar.

If you love NY pizza, you will love Mama Mia 9 out of 10 times.  As a New Yorker myself, I can say that Mama Mia takes care of the craving for good, real, NY pizza.  And you can't beat the deal... $4 for 2 slices and a can of Coke.  The only issue I have with Mama Mia is that 1 time out of 10, when something just isn't quite right.  I can't tell you what it is because I don't know, but I end up throwing the pizza out.  And then I usually take a break from Mama Mia for about 2 weeks.  But, 9 out of 10 times, the food is spot on.  If you haven't yet, be sure to give Mama Mia a try!

You mean you can get good BBQ in Phoenix too?  Amazing!  Another one of those places that took me a year to discover, which is probably good, since I'll be going here weekly.  One complaint and one complaint only - way too much sauce on the BBQ.  I mean, WAY too much.  Other than that, all expectations were exceeded.  The food was delicious, just as I remember BBQ should be.  I got the pulled pork sandwich, a slice of texas toast, a side of mac n' cheese, and an iced tea.  Even the iced tea was good.  Perfect flavors, served hot and fresh, and saucy.  I believe I was served by Stacy himself, who I guess just kind of does his own thing.  Like tell you how good the food is going to be.  He also has a knack for decorating - like using magic marker to give customers instructions on how to turn on the bathroom light, etc.  My favorite was the sign: "You are on private property.  Don't touch the things on the walls."  Or something like that, but the sign did capture the overall essence of the place, which I'm more than cool with.  BRING CASH!  Seriously, a credit card machine would not fit in at Stacy's.

Yum!  An awesome Italian restaurant in the middle of sketch-ville.  Tonight I tried the cheese ravioli (take out), and was pretty impressed... Impressed enough to tell everyone at work they might have been the best ravioli I've ever had.  All of their pastas are homemade, and it shows.  The pasta was light, fresh and delicious, as was the cheese inside.  The sauce screamed fresh, and had the perfect spicy bite to it.  An added bonus were the little pita-like things that I suppose come with all entrees.  They came from the wood fire oven, which smelled incredible while inside the restaurant.  Here's the deal... it's not the best part of town, but you won't get stabbed or mugged here, so park your car and come inside for some gooooooood food.

I've only been once so far for lunch take out, but it was an easy 4-star experience.  I think the girl working the counter (and serving) was an absolute charm, and you could tell she loved working there.  The other staff seemed equally enthused.  I'm a fan of Cuban food, but not a fan of the lack Cuban food in the valley.  I was excited to find this gem hiding along I-17 the other day, and definitely expect to be back.  As for the food, I've only tried one thing, and it was kind of weird.  But listen to the name and the concept, and try to give me a reason not to try it?  Papo Relleno, which I think means stuffed, fried potato.  Which is the perfect name for this - baked potato, stuffed with chicken and stuff, and then deep fried.  It was kind of like a potato latke of sorts, not amazing but definitely worth the try.  It came with a "salad" (some lettuce underneath it, with what tasted like Italian dressing) and a thing of chicken soup.  Careful, they keep the soup hot - don't burn your tongue like I did!  Can't wait to go back, and will definitely be here before giving Havana Cafe another shot any time soon.

I could go on and on and on, but let's just cut to the chase: this place is horrible.  I don't think you could pay me to imagine a less-enjoyable dining experience.  Even though half the tables were empty, we were asked to wait at the bar.  Not a bad idea, who minds a drink before dinner?  Well, when you think "bar," think the breakfast bar at you grandma's condo.  Maybe one or two extra tacky, awkward-backed bar stools.  I couldn't count 10 bottles of liquor, and I think they went into the kitchen to get my beer (eventually).  Service?  It didn't exist.  We literally had to grab them (physically) when it was time to take our order (ok, time had come and gone, but we grabbed them eventually).  Forget about water, more bread, etc.  I think my favorite part of the meal was the all-out yelling match the owner got into with a customer.  I believe he used the "F-" word when conveying his disappointment with the fact that they'd been waiting over an hour for their food.  OK, so you leave that language outside, but everyone in the restaurant was feeling his pain.  And I never think it's okay to argue with a customer, but this woman was more than arguing - she was making a point for the entire dining room to hear.  The food?  Overpriced and way underwhelming.  I paid about $17 for what was essentially a plate of spaghetti, butter, and some zucchini.  No flavor, no pizzaz.  I was entertained enough by overloading it with the pepper I found on the table, pretending it was a garnish.  So the meal sucked, the service sucked, the ambiance missed the opening of this place.  The good news is the owner gave us a business card, wrote 20% off on it, and said she was sorry for yelling and we should come back.  I'm an honest person, but I took this opportunity to lie and tell her we would.

One of my top-5 restaurants in town!  I first tried El Salvadoreno because I had a Restaurant.com card I needed to use.  I felt like it was a pretty big risk, seeing as I've never had Pupusas before, and I didn't speak the same language as any of the workers.  Fortunately for us, the menu has English subtitles, and better yet - Pictures!  Let's cut to the chase... Pupusas are the specialty, and you'd be a fool if you didn't try one.  I'd go with pork, cheese, beans, but why not get 2 or 3 and try something adventurous?  Be careful, the food is filling and I can never finish my plate.  My favorite dish is the Arroz ala Vallencia, which is basically rice with chicken, shrimp, onions, peppers, etc.  It's served with their hot black bean mash type thing, 2 chips, and 2 home-made tortillas.  Their fresh, hot tortillas are the best, especially dipped in the beans.  And as with all my favorites, they serve Mexican Coke (the soda), as well as Jarritos and a few other bottles familiar to most Spanish-speakers.  Plan to spend a while here.  The service is great, but rushing is not part of the experience.  Relax.  Eat a pupusa (kind of like a stuffed, doughy tortilla pancake... with stuff inside it).  Delcious restaurant, authentic and very reasonably priced.  I first went to the Maryvale location, and they are both pretty much the same.

This place was pretty good for Mexican, and I'll definitely be back.  My favorite was the Vampiro, which had guacamole and yummy grilled onions.  The bean and cheese burrito was huge and pretty good.  They also seem to have a pretty good happy hour menu which I'll be inclined to take advantage of.  The service was pretty good and the workers friendly, overall I have no complaints.  Although if a bottle of Coke is really $3, I would certainly stick with water.

Who am I fooling, I love this place.  7th Ave location is perfect for take-out on my dinner break at work, and the 7th St location is just right for walking to from my apartment.  When you go there, order: -Chips and Salsa (spicy, or course) - delicious, and don't be shy about asking for some free refills -Carne Asada Vampiro -Pastor Vampiro  Nothing more, nothing less.   This is one of my absolute favorite meals in Phoenix any day of the week.  It also makes for a great hangover cure!  I have been disappointed by the size of the regular burritos, but the Vampiros really are over-the-top good.

Hanny's is a pretty cool spot to grab a late-night snack and cocktail.  More of an intimate restaurant vibe than a drinking spot like I was originally expecting, but for a calm night it's a sure bet.  Definitely check out the elevator shaft you can stand in, as well as the bathrooms that kind of make you feel more like you're at a carnival than a classy establishment... but I mean that in a good way.

Hidden Gem.  And this gem shines bright (literally, it's got tons of fancy blue light oozing out through the doors and windows).  Good evening, Downtown Phoenix, it's past 10pm and there's still a place to go.  The reverse happy hour here (starts at 10:30pm Fridays, not sure about other nights) brings me back.  $7 sake bombs, where being loud and making a mess is never a problem.  Shannon (possibly the best waitress anywhere) will probably just come be a loud mess with you.  There's been a DJ in the kitchen every time I've been by, and the music is perfect for a Friday night transition between bars.  Oh yeah, the food's good too.

As of this weekend, LPV is officially back.  It looks as though they've been forced to stay in their truck, so you won't see the guys grilling outside anymore.  Don't worry, the food is just as good as always.  I've been told they will be back Thursday-Saturday 8pm-4am, and Sundays from 5pm-2am.  Thank God!  Seriously, this is some of the best food in Phoenix.  Cheap, hearty, and delicious!

No bueno.  Had an okay haircut here once that would have earned probably 3 stars including mediocre service. Went back again today for the same reason - they're open when my usual place is closed. Or so I thought. I called at 3:45 to make sure they were open, and the guy on the phone assured me I had until 5pm. When I got there at 4:10, he said sorry and pointed to the clock. When I told him I was the one that called, he unapologetically pointed back at the clock and resumed his haircut. I won't chance another lackluster haircut here. Instead, I'll go back to mid city, where the sketchy location gives way to cheap, quality haircuts with great service.

If grandma comes to town and tells you a place reminds HER of Key West, you know it's legit.  But I didn't need that sort of confirmation.  At first I wouldn't be caught dead eating anything other than the bananas foster french toast (and trust me, someone at your table NEEDS to get this dish - don't worry, the full size order is way more than enough to share).  But then, one day, I tried something else - the Local Breeze Omlet... whoa!  Scrambled eggs, Proscuitto, Goat Cheese, Asparagus, Tomato, Basil galore.  In the mood for lunch?  Just go for anything on the menu.  Salads, burgers, sandwiches... just point to something and you'll be pleased no matter what.  But the best suggestion I can give on this place is go for the weekend brunch.  You'll be glad you did.  And I feel obligated to share this secret, since I just learned of it this weekend myself...  Rocky Point eggs (trust me on this one).  Full disclosure: they stop serving breakfast foods around 11am.  DO NOT MISS THIS DEADLINE!  Also, although good, I would skip the sangria (and don't expect an $8 value out of your $8 mimosa).  Be sure to check out the bathroom before you go (go before you go?), it's pretty cool, like the rest of the place.  And, 10% discount if you ride your bike on the weekends.  Are you heading to Local Breeze yet?

Top choice for pizza in the Biltmore area for sure.  So good!  The ambiance is great, perfect for a date or small group.    This is the kind of place where you want to order a bottle of wine and an appetizer, hang out for a while, get and share a pizza, hang out for a while, get and share another pizza... you get the idea.  I forget exactly what we ordered, but I do remember getting the night's special pizza and being absolutely blown away.  The service was awesome, the type where you want to become friends with the staff.  And the food top-notch.  Free valet parking, great atmosphere, great wine... although I take no credit for choosing.  That's my job when it comes to pizza, and I can do my job quite well here.

Yep, Hula's is one of my favorite places in Phoenix.  Totally awesome menu, great service, and great tropical drinks - even for people like me who hate tropical drinks.  Seriously, get over to Hula's right now and have a Mai Tai.  Tiki Time at Hula's is great, with $5 drink specials and food specials during the week.  Plus, how much better does Tiki Time sound than Happy Hour?  You can get that anywhere.  The salads are worth skipping, but everything else on the menu is outstanding.  If you're feeling healthy-ish, grab the black bean burger.  It's better than most hamburgers.  And of course get the sweet potato fries.  Other menu favorites are the spicy edamame appetizer, mac and cheese, and the Jawaiian Jerk Pork plate.  Save some of your diabetes for the coconut banana cream pie.  Whenever the weather permits, be sure to sit on the patio.  Warning - it will be hard to leave.  And if it starts to get chilly, snag a spot by the firepit.  Or just up at the bar.

Rip's has become our favorite neighborhood bar for a few reasons.  The first and most important being Karaoke.  There's a reason it was voted best in the valley (New Times '11).  Karaoke is usually pretty terrible, but not at Rip's - the host, Jen, is a great host and singer.  And the other singers vary in skill, but the crowd is always supportive.  Drinks are usually pretty cheap, and all the bartenders are great - the kind that like to know your name.  Obscura is not a typical night for Rip's, but is an AWESOME dance night.  Stop by Rip's any day for a good time.

Lola Coffee is definitely my favorite downtown coffee shop.  The service is always quick and friendly, and they always make my drink exactly how I like it without asking.  They just seem to do it right, each and every time.  There's always something delicious waiting for you in the baked good section, and if you're lucky enough to catch the cherry rice pudding, you're luckier than I've been in several months.  The coffee might just be the strongest in town (and it still tastes great) - I've always got the good-shakes for a while after I visit.

TMI just earned its spot at the top of my go-to list in Phoenix.  I'm glad we made an impromptu stop for lunch here today.  The old, historic house offers a comfy, inviting spot to relax and enjoy an awesome meal.  Sara, our waitress, provided exceptional service, and the bonus was her knowledge of their beer menu.  They have about 10 beers on draft, mainly local, all delicious.  I believe their taps rotate, but if they have it don't skip out on the Sleep Dog Red Rover.  Delicious with lunch, and hard to beat at $2.50/pint before 6pm.  We started with their asparagus soup - amazing.  Next up sandwiches.  For me, the roast beef (hold the cheese) with their house-made mustard.  Main ingredient in the mustard?  Oak Creek Amber, also my favorite beer.  My friend grabbed the "Cash Money," which we were uncertain about.  I can't imagine anything better - cashew butter (that I assume was home made), bananas, and a delicious cabernet-red pepper jelly, all served warm on toasted bread.  A-Mazing!  The patio was great for a nice Phoenix day, and the location can't be beat.  If you haven't been to TMI yet, hurry, you'll be sad you waited.

Awful!  I understand AZ casinos are not like Vegas casinos, but this place was just terrible.  I expected so much more out of a brand new casino.  It was small and felt cramped in every aspect.  The cigarette smoke was unbearable and offensive.  The staff was extremely rude, and everything is hard to find.  The drinks are expensive and the bartenders are horrible - rude and extremely slow.    I wrote in about our terrible experience... I got a voice mail, and have tried five times now to get back in touch with the guy, to no avail.  They show that they don't care about their customers in any way, so I recommend you waste your money elsewhere... that's what I'll be doing!

I'm incredibly disappointed in Cupcakes by Design.  It simply didn't provide the quality you would expect from a business that sells only one product.  In fact, I don't feel they delivered quality at all.  I paid $22 for 6 cupcakes.  If I wasn't out of town for a week, I would have brought them back and asked for a refund.  I think it says a lot when you have a dinner party and still have 5 of 6 cupcakes left over at the end of the night.  The cake portion wasn't as good as a box cake mix.  I can't remember the time I've had a (cup)cake that was that lackluster.  It wasn't notably moist, didn't have a distinct texture, and most importantly had zero flavor.  I ordered 3 different varieties and all tasted exactly the same.  The frosting was equally disappointing.  Again, none had much flavor other than "sweet."  Truly, funfetti icing tastes far better.  Although taste is most important, I also feel the presentation was lacking quite a bit for cupcakes that cost nearly $4 a piece.  There was no design, the frosting was kind of just thrown on top, nothing fancy in terms of bags or boxes... and what I thought was kind of funny... each cupcake had this hand-made, tacky sign stuck into it (think piece of scrap paper, hand-written flavor, taped to a tooth pick - tacky grandma's house style).  Look, I'll eat just about anything.  But I wouldn't waste my time on these cupcakes ever again, and unless there's a major re-vamp here, I don't think many people would.

It saddens me to write such a bad review for one reason - I might be Fuego Bistro's biggest fan.  So you can imagine how excited I was when I heard they were opening a taco place right around the corner from where I live.  Sometimes excitement quickly turns to disappointment and sadness, and such is the case with Fuego Tacos.  Let's just go start to finish: -Salsa is inedible.  Way too spicy, and not good spicy, it's damn take this away spicy -Drinks - half the size of the ones at Fuego Bistro, no good.  Not enough alcohol and the Sangria (which is top-notch at Bistro) tasted more like red Kool Aid -Food - not so good.  I got the veggie tacos, which tasted more like a taco shell filled with sweet (not good-sweet, bad-sweet) corn salsa. -Service - not too bad, but management response was a turn off.  We went in with Enamor coupons that clearly stated there were no limits, and they would only let us use one even though we were 2 parties with 2 checks.  Owner was called on the phone and didn't provide a great response. -Atmosphere - would be awesome, but not for this place.  More of a trendy could-be club guised as a fancy taco place.  Please, check out the reviews for Fuego Bistro and go there.  It quite possibly offers the best food, service, and patio dining in Phoenix.  Fuego Tacos needs an overhaul, and I can for sure say I won't be back.

The Garage is a great new place atop what is slowly becoming my favorite intersection.  The service is fantastic, they have a few good beers on tap, and the food looks to be promising.  They also have a decent happy hour, which as I remember has $1 off tap beer and some wine specials.  What they lack is any happy hour food prices, which would definitely bring me back here often.    We only had food once, which was a flatbread.  Pretty good although nothing to write home about.  Their menu looks promising but I would consider the food a tad too pricey.    The atmosphere is pretty good (with the exception of the lighting in the men's room, which can kill you if you're not careful).  I think its a great place to stop in for happy hour before heading over to the Swizzle Inn to get your drink on.

How have I lived a few blocks from this place and just now found out about it?  I'm all about ethnic foods, and Sekong will find itself toward the top of my list.  The most expensive menu item is $10, with most meals about $8.  Most meals come in combo form with rice, soup (Winter Melon at the time we went, delicious), an egg roll and some pickled vegetables.  The decor is awesome - warm and welcoming, with each table featuring a few Cambodian travel books.  Service is awesome and helpful.  The menu has just about anything you could want but it isn't overwhelming (don't worry, nothing is too adventurous).

Of course Windsor is good!  Almost, yes almost, as good as Postino.  My big gripe was the fondue, which was just bleh.  And I'm not the only one who's felt that way.  Our last waitress said they hadn't had complaints about it "lately," so they might have fixed it.  $5 for an awesome cocktail, glass of wine, or 2-pint-pitcher of a decent beer selection has me using Windsor as a starting point fairly often on the weekends.

It's like hooters, kind of.  Or at least I think that's what their going for.    Food - not bad Drinks - standard bar Atmosphere - ok for a sports bar downtown, lots of TVs Service - yeah right.  You'll need to head to the bar at least once if you want to drink anything.  Would I go again?  Yeah, but only if I was meeting someone there and didn't have a chance to persuade them to go elsewhere.  And because it's close to the light rail.

This place is awesome, and I'm not even a vegetarian!  First points go to the ambiance... the place has kind of a cool "green" feel to it, but is also very modern and open.  The garage door in front opens during nice weather, and the place is very airy.  Second points go to the food.  I really have no idea what I'm eating, but I've been a few times and haven't been disappointed.  Service/staff is pretty good, they definitely fit the theme of the place.  Minus one point for having an awesome staircase that leads to nothing but an office... and a tiny bit of a point for recommending "Nami," the place next door that I think they own.  It's a vegan bakery that is overpriced with so-so taste.

Finally, a 5-star breakfast joint in a city that up until now hasn't wowed me with the morning food.  Wy-Knot fits right in with the other restaurants in its 7th Street stretch, perfectly delivering its niche-food and homey ambiance.  Most importantly, the people who work here are amazing.  You feel right at home, except the food is way better than anything you'll ever get at my house.  A trip here wouldn't be complete without trying their award-winning (literally) stuffed Cinnamon french toast.  It's to die for, so don't even think about ordering anything else.  Our table of 3 split that and a Prosciutto & Roasted Roma Tomatoes sandwich, served with goat cheese on a perfect ciabatta roll.  Sweet and savory, with an overdose of iced coffee.  Other reviews have mentioned that the food takes a while to prepare.  While I didn't find that to be the case, we did mention numerous times how this place has the perfect "slow-breakfast" vibe.  Not slow in that it took too long, slow in that we really enjoyed taking our time and spending our morning here.  It was fun to order one thing, split it, order something else, split it, and just hang for a while.  No complaints here.  The menu is priced very fairly in the $7-9 range, when they could easily charge more for some of their signature dishes.  This is something I appreciate, and will keep me coming back.  Dog-friendly patio?  Forget about it on a day like today with 113 degree heat... but my pooch will definitely be having Sunday Brunch out there with me in a few months.

The Phoenix Cheesesteak Co. adds a new flavor to the Coronado district, which along 7th St. is home to some of the best local restaurants.  I thoroughly enjoyed my "Westside," a gigantic cheese steak made with portobello mushrooms, bell peppers, avocado, onions, provolone and chili mayo.  The bread was fantastic, as was nearly everything else.  I do agree that the "chunks" of steak might not be the best idea, as some of them are a little gristly (to the point of looking for pieces to avoid).  That didn't stop me from finishing the sandwich from end to end.  The chili may is delicious... and this is coming from someone whose biggest fear is mayonnaise.   On top of that, the place is shiny-clean, and the service is top-notch.  I'm convinced I was helped by the owner, and his motivation is clearly to provide the best possible customer service.  I could walk here from home, but it just feels so much better to drive after one of these belly busters.

I'm consistently grateful to have a selection of the Upwards family of restaurants within walking distance to my house.  We call on Federal Pizza frequently if we don't feel like driving more than a few minutes for a good pizza night.  As expected, the vibe and service are top notch.  While Cibo and The Parlor still top my pizza list, I truly have no bad things to say of Federal's menu.  Get the roasted veggie board for a healthy appetizer like you've never tried before.  If the weather plays nice, grab a table on the patio and a few of their homemade wine coolers to share (but be careful, some can be way too sweet).  Take a walk down toward Practical Art to burn off that pizza crust after dinner!

I've been eying the Trattoria since it opened, and finally got a chance to stop in last weekend.  I was excited about the ambiance - the place looks modern and fresh, and I had the impression the menu would wow me.  The service was great and the decor was fun - a great place to take a shopping break (or just cool off when its 115 out).  The menu was pretty exciting, but the food fell short.  Our Avocado Carpaccio was fun indeed - not what we would have expected, but definitely different and enjoyable.  The flavor combinations were interesting, and we commented that it could have passed as a dessert (not a bad thing).  But it was pretty small, certainly just a snack.  The Flatbread Chicken & Citrus Kale was the dish I was most looking forward to, and also most disappointed in.  The chicken itself was very dry and didn't have much flavor.  In fact, I didn't taste much of the sweet pea puree, crispy copa ham, fried egg, and definitely missed the white truffle oil.  The bread was fine, but again very dry.  I'm hoping I went on an off day, because the ambiance and service remind me of my favorite restaurants in town - I just wish the food did too.

Love Tertio!    Somewhere between Postino and Cheuvront lies Tertio, the newest wine bar in Phoenix.  The wine and beer menu are pretty stellar and they have a great happy hour (Monday - Friday 4-7pm).  They have 3 beers on tap and they're always local - currently featuring Four Peaks, Lumberyard, and Phoenix Ale Brewery.  Best part?  $3 pints on Fridays!  The small plates menu sets Tertio apart from other similar restaurants.  It's not your typical bruschetta and salads kind of plates.  The avocado crunch is a great twist on one of my favorite foods and the hummus is probably the best I've had.  Tertio's walls have already seen two different art "exhibits" since they've been open, and they always showcase local artists.  All of the table tops are also painted by local artists which is pretty cool.  Hopefully by the summer I'll have sat at each of them.

Speaking as a non-vegan, non-vegetarian, non-gluten free, eat it if it tastes good type of diner, I can still say this is one of my favorite breakfast places.  The menu has a wide range of food with silly names (Koo-Koo Bananas Pancakes, Fruity Ol' Goat, and my current favorite, the Gluten Free Your Mind Waffle).  Each and every item comes from a carefully crafted recipe, and leaves behind any hint of healthy diet restrictions.  The pie, cookies, and even coffee and iced tea are all great.  The only reason a star is left off is that while friendly, the service is sometimes painfully slow.  We had to stop coming before work as it sometimes just took way too long.  Today it was far better, so this could be a staffing issue that's since been resolved.  Bottom line, everyone in Phoenix should check out Bragg's for breakfast.  If you've got visitors who are vegan, etc., this is definitely a place to bring them.

Scratch is still very new, so I'm looking forward to a lot of changes for the better.  They've got a great location, and the owner seems to have the enthusiasm for success.  Our first attempt at scratch was kind of a disaster.  We had quite a large group and were there within their first month open, so it was almost to be expected.  However we were assured they could handle our group so we gave it a shot.  The service was slow at best.  Our waitress didn't seem to know how to handle a large table and made it a point to tell us that many, many times.  She made us feel like a burden, but reminded us that she had 20 years experience (so I'm not sure what the problem was).  We were later visited by the owner, and I believe some friends who didn't even work there who he called in to help - bonus points.  Still, after being told we couldn't order anything beside basic drinks (because the bartender "probably won't know how to make them), we waited forever for water, beer, and eventually food.  I can't vouch for anyone else because frankly I wasn't paying attention, but my veggie burger seemed like something from the Sysco truck.  Not impressed.  Try #2: Brunch.  Service was still slow and confused, but much better.  The Eggs Royale were commendable - their salmon has a uniquely mild and delicious flavor, and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  I was looking forward to trying one of their pastries, but was disappointed with the selection.  The pastry case looked bored.  With only about 3 different choices, the pastries looked good but unimpressive for bakery standards.  They had a selection of macaroons, which although likely fresh, seemed a bit pricey at $3.75 each.  I ended up skipping the pastries.  Lastly, and most notably, the place lacks personality.  There's something about the newly renovated complex Scratch lives in that makes it a fun place to go, but the atmosphere ends at the gate.

This is a great new spot.  The cocktail menu is intimidating at 24 pages, but helps make for a fun experience, especially for infrequent drinkers.  You'll feel like you're one of the cool kids here.

I somehow only made it to Coronado Cafe once before they closed, and it was a great experience.  So I was naturally excited to see the transformation into Urban Vine.  Unfortunately, I wish it hadn't changed.  I see and admire what the place is going for, but it seems they've tried too hard.  Simple lunch foods were fancied up too much.  The burger was just okay, and the chicken sandwich didn't taste like any other chicken sandwich I've had before.  Boo.  Both came with chips that were so heavy on the salt and vinegar that we couldn't eat them.  A fresh selection of things to add to your water was fun.  Lastly, the table was as crowded as the menu, and simply wasn't comfortable.  Here's the thing - a simple old house with a simple old menu would have the chance to be very successful here.  If that happens, I'll be excited to return.
