I typically eat Pizza Heaven via delivery, and it shows up to my house in about 20 minutes, which is ridiculously fast. Their pizza is amazing. Their salads are also amazing. Their wings are, you guessed it, amazing! They have several Vegan dishes, and they're very delicious.

This is one of my favorite central Phoenix spots. Great coffee, great food.

I'm not giving this 1 star because their food is bad, because it's not. I'm giving them 1 star because, for the 3rd time, they have completely screwed my order up. It's 2:02pm, I ordered my pizza at 11:20am (almost 3 hours ago). My pizza is still "on its way" as it has been since the first time I called at 12:30. They have given me so many excuses, but unfortunately, I ordered pizza, not BS.   I spoke with their manager, he offered me 50% off, but I still don't think that 50% is any good. I was hungry when I ordered, but now, due to the length of time it takes them to deliver, I already ate, and frankly, I don't want the pizza anymore.   The sad part is, Mama Mia's pizza is amazingly good. It's their management that is terrible. I used to work at a pizza shop when I was younger, and we never would have let even an hour go by if someone was waiting on some food (let alone 3 hours). I normally order from Mama Mia's once or twice a week, and it usually takes them about an hour to deliver, which is fine. This is the 3rd time they've screwed up. Last time, they LITERALLY DID NOT CUT MY PIZZA. So, they basically delivered a huge pizza that we had to tear apart with our hands (we're bachelors, what can I say).  I will never order from them again, ever. I WAS a huge fan until now.

This is one of my favorite smaller venues in downtown phoenix. The sound guy is a pro, and he is dedicated to making sure everything sounds perfect. The drinks are inexpensive. There's a nice patio outside with picnic tables if you're trying to escape loud music or have a private conversation. All in all, it's a great venue. A few people I know have had trouble finding it because it's on a weird split/one-way street, but if you use Google Maps, you'll find it without any problems.

Hands down the best tacos in town. Their guac is delicious too. The building used to be a church, so the vibe in there is super rad. Taco Guild is a great place to hang out with friends and eat great tacos.

I can't express enough how awesome this place is. Great beer (not expensive), friendly staff, and literally ALL of the classic arcade games from the 80's-90's. If you're looking for a good place to kill some time, this is the spot. On busy nights, you might have to wait in line to play some of the games.
