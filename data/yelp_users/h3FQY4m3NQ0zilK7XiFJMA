I have been in my new home and with Cox Cable for exactly three days.  For three days, I have contacted Cox due to various issues with my cable box.  Also, they sent a technician to give me a different box.  That was this afternoon, but that box also stopped working.  I have spent more time on hold listening to their hold music than I have watching television.  (My next battle will be to not pay for listening to their hold music).  Their online chat support was also less than helpful and suggested I take time off of work to wait for another technician.  I quit using Cox for my internet at my last residence because of poor service and now I am experiencing the same level of non-service with their cable.  Be smart, save your money and watch your favorite tv shows on the internet.  Just don't use Cox for your internet service!!!

Chuck helped me find the perfect mattress at a great price!   I tried several and instantly fell in love with one of their Brooklyn Beds.  Great customer service experience.  Check them out and you'll find the task of finding a mattress easy and hassle free. Sweet dreams!

A coworker introduced me to this place and now it's the only place I go.  They do a great job and my gel manicures LAST.  The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is great. Price is the same as any other place, but the experience is far better.  I love the Polish Room!
