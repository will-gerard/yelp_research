I came in here to try a free week. Nice, friendly staff. There's more than enough equipment to get a good workout in. I really liked this gym a lot and will definitely consider becoming a member.

Many tv's in this sports bar, but ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE AND OFFENSIVELY OVERPRICED FOOD.  The chicken sandwich was just terrible! the bun was the cheap "great value" brand that you would find at wal-mart. The chicken was processed low quality chicken. The french fries were discusting, To top it all off, I paid 10$ FOR THIS PIECE OF SHIT CHICKEN SANDWICH. Also, for UFC event's there is a 5$ cover. So many other places to go nearby where there is no cover.  There are plenty of other sports bar's in scottsdale that are much better than this bar. Don't waste your time here.

I love this place. They get legitimate artists to come through their club. Ticket and drink prices are reasonable. Never a line to get in.

Convenient corner market has everything you need! Friendly service, reasonable prices, and most importantly really good sandwhiches.   The owner is one of the friendliest guys you'll ever talk to.  Beer selection is diverse and reasonably priced.  Sandwhiches are amazing.  5 stars all day!

Great food and drinks. Julie is a great bartender! Try one of the tacos, they're all worth a try.

I have frequented this pub often since its beginning. The food and beer are great, and there atleast 2 dozen TV's in this place. Truly one of my favorite places to go in Scottsdale.   I went to watch a Diamondbacks game with a friend, and figured SBC would be a great place to go since there dozens of televisions! Long story short, the owner refused to change one of the two TV's on our side of the bar because they were "both reserved." The only other group on our side of the bar supposedly had one of the TV's reserved, I understand that.   However, the second TV was broadcasting the 4th quarter of a 30 point blowout in a basketball game which was also being shown on at least 10 other TV"s. I kindly asked the owner if he could reconsider changing that 2nd TV broadcasting the blowout, in which he said "sorry it's reserved" and basically walked away. The dude was very rude and disrespectful, I've heard that he's an egomaniac and he sure is!  I was incredibly disappointed with this experience.I loved coming to this place but unfortunately I won't be coming back again.
