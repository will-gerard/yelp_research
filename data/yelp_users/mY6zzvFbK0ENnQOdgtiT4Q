I have taken my German Shepherd dog and my Shiba Inu to this place and have always been pleased. In fact they do such a good job I only have to take them twice to three times a year. Staff is friendly. We love Kristin and Tierra! Wouldn't take my dogs any where else!

Great food! But not worth the HORRIBLE SERVICE! Took about 15 mins for drinks that included a dr pepper. The server said the bartender is working hard... On my dr pepper?? Asked for more chips and salsa 3 times. Never got them. Food came out fast though. Will not go back.

Loved the previous place. The building is so pretty. But now the food is very very bland. Such a disappointment. As a party of three we all got different meals and we were all three not impressed.
