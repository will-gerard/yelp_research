Based on having stayed across the street at the Embassy Suites on a couple of visits, the Ritz Carlton by far exceeded my expectations and only for $10 more a night!  Okay, so the free nightly booze and early morning breakfast isn't included, but the room was well kept and fairly spacious with all the amenities that you would expect.  Wireless and wired internet is an extra charge.  I heard the Miami Heat was staying at the hotel the same night and so does most of the visiting NBA teams.  It's located in pretty nice part of Phoenix that happens to be across the street from a fairly high end mall and just minutes away from Downtown or Scottsdale.  I know where I'm staying at the next time I come for business.

This was one of the few spots that I actually enjoyed in the whole city.  We went here for late night drinks and they were serving up free sushi and fried won ton.  On top of that, the large Sapporo sake bombs only cost $6!!!!!  I haven't had the food outside of the free stuff, but my co-worker tells me that you never eat raw sushi in Phoenix because it can't be fresh in the middle of the desert.

This location is fairly clean, decent sized, and easy to get to.  I wish there was a basketball gym.    They need to update a lot of their equipment.

I still feel a little bit more dumb after the indoor cart racing experience here.  Take the constant smell of exhaust fumes, this place was really fun.  We went here for a business team event and the 10 of us went at it.  Of course I placed 1st in all categories, but if I finished last I would have still had a great time.  The give discounts to parties over 8 people, trophies to the top 3 racers and free t-shirts.  Go here if you are around this area and you are bored.

Place was pretty nice with a lot of the upper scale stores.  See the other review for more details.

Located in the Fashion Show Mall, this is the place to grab those Hawaiian goodies while in the City of Sin.  Come here mainly for the cheap bottle water, it is twice the size and the same price as the hotels are charging.  No spam mitsubi on the counters though!

This has to be thee best hotel experience I've had in Vegas.  The panoramic rooms live up to their name sake.  I saw the back end of the strip and the rest of N Las Vegas for about 40-50 miles from the 52nd Floor.  Killer view at night!  LCD televisions in your room and in your bathroom, so you don't miss a beat with your sports bets.  From the television to the phone to the card key, everything had my name on it.    This hotel has so many amenities and things to do that you practically don't need to leave the hotel to get the Vegas experience.  Even though they allow smoking indoors in Las Vegas, this place didn't have that stale smoke smell.  They even have a stable of Ferraris for viewing or for sale if you hit it really big.  The Fashion Show mall is conviently located across the street.  The  card dealers were friendly and helpful for novices like me.  Shit, this place put a bunch of their money in my pocket!!!    The Buffet is unreal, you will not find another one like this.  They had a Chinese section, a Indian section, Italian section , Japanese section, Turkey dinner section, etc.  Don't let get started on the dessert area.  Be sure to go here after starving yourself for a couple of days!!!    I love this place, too bad reality sets in and you have to go home.

I was getting tired of all the chain restaurants that we were eating at and I asked around for a recommendation of Mexican food.  This place was the highlight of my week in Phoenix.  Great family owned business that delivers on authentic Mexican taste.   The shredded beef taco, the creamy chicken plate, and the flan was all off the hook.  The spot is off of Scottsdale blvd, but it is worth the drive where ever you are coming from.  Only if they served carnitas....

This is just for Manhattan Express.  $12 you get the best way to see the strip and that's if you're not closing your eyes like a wuss!  The ride is long for a roller coaster ride and the wait was like 15 minutes.  The ride can be ruff and there isn't any padding in the seats, its just you and plastic!  Oh and the hotel seems pretty nice too!  It hasn't fallen apart like some of the other hotels over the years.

Venetian is pretty amazing with their quality layout, design and housing my favorite Las Vegas restaurant, Bouchon.  The shopping area is similar to Paris and the Ceasar's Forum with the faux sky, but what sets this place apart is the indoor\outdoor gondolas rides. I really enjoyed it, although it can be a little awkward with all those damn tourists taking pictures of you while you are chillin' during your 15min ride.  It cuts into your wallet with $15 per person price tag.  Do it for your lady!

Following the tradition of quality restaurants in Northern California, Thomas Keller hasn't let the good people of Las Vegas down.  Just like most higher-end restaurants in Vegas, Bouchon has a perfectly designed interior to match the theme of their food.  If it isn't too windy, try sitting outdoors on their patio next to the fountain.  The food was amazing from beginning to the end.  Service was a little slow, but the place was packed.    Run down of what I ordered and all of it I recommend:  -Petit Plateau   (1/2 lobster, 9 oysters, 3 shrimp, 3 clams, 6 mussels)  "I can't imagine it getting any fresher than this in Vegas."  -Pt de Campagne   (country style pt with watercress, cornichons & radishes)  "Kinda of like liverwurst from the can, but 1000 times better!"  -Steak Frites   (Medium Rare with caramelized onions and seasoned slab of butter on top)  "Cooked to & flavored to perfection, tender and clean tasting."  -Moules au Safran et  la Moutarde   (Maine bouchot mussels steamed in white wine, Pt de Campagne avec Roquefort et aux Noix mustard & saffron, served with french fries)  "If you like mussels, well you get 30-35 mussels excellently prepared in a butter saffron base."  -Madagascar Creme Brulee'  (special for the night)  "Creamy with a layer of vanilla bean particles lining the bottom."  -Free French mini pastries and a bag of caramelized popcorn to go!!!  -A perfectly matched gurtziminer for the 1st half and pinor noir for the 2nd half of the meal.    I'm drooling thinking about this meal!  This is a Las Vegas MUST EAT!!!!

I didn't make it for the club they hold at this place, but I did make it for lunch and I wish I didn't.  Great location with amazing detail, especially with the lighting.  I think the looks suckered us in.  You would think the food would be just as good.    They charged $9 for tricolor chips that tasted like they were from a bag and salsa that sucked.  The poke wrapped in a roll was cold and flavorless.  I had to send the fried calamari away because it was soggy and laced with I believe was MSG.  I did like the Pan Con Lechon, which is a Cuban pulled pork sandwich and their spiked up Pina Colada, the Havana Cabana.    Come for the club and rum, not for the food!

Asking around Vegas what the hottest club is at the moment, most people said, "Tryst!"  The place is packed to the walls until closing, which unlike SF is 4am-ish.  Decent mix of hip hop and dance hall while we were there.  People here were dressed to impress and you can't beat the outdoor patio area with the waterfall.  The inside is laid out in 3 lounge areas with a main dance floor that leaks out to the patio.  There are a lot of drunk, rude-ass people that constantly bump into you on the dance floor, but it could be like that at all clubs in Vegas.  It does pays to stay at the Wynn because we were taken past the line like freakin' VIPs just by flashing your room card.

Not the ordinary buffet that you're expecting.  I asked the lady up front, "Is this quality or quantity?"  She said, "Mr. Wynn only expects the best in his hotel."  She was right.  You really get more than 6 themes of food that range from average to above average in taste.  We're talking Chinese to Indian to what I like to call the Thanksgiving section.  The most impressive part was the dessert area.  It had almost everything you could thing of.  ex. crepes, ice cream sundaes, creme brulees, and the list goes on.  I was bummed that there wasn't lobster, but they did have snow crab legs.  Definitely worth the money!!!

Come to the Wynn's Esplanade, break out $4 and go to Chocolat.  Ask the person for a Bouchee, open, bite, and smile because you just ate a chocolate masterpiece that is like a Snicker's candy bar taken to the next level.  I also tried their 4x larger than your average French Macaroon, but pass on those because they overly sweet and are just average.  Large selection of different chocolates.    Man, I'm still thinking about that Bouchee (milk chocolate, cookie, caramel)

While visiting Phoenix from the Bay Area, my co-worker based out there took a couple of us on this 15 minute drive and ended up at this small strip mall.  He kept on telling us that you'll love this place!  We finally got to the restaurant, Chino Bandido?!?  WTF!  Once inside they take the new visitors off to the side to try 8 of their most popular items.  The place is Chinese meets Mexican with a Caribbean flair to it.  It is confusing when it comes to ordering, but the staff is willing to help with any questions.  Basically, you can take any item and throw it on the side, in a burrito, or in a quesadilla.  The prices are reasonable for the amount of food that you get.  I recommend the Carnitas and the Jerk Chicken.  It was weird that you can see chopsticks next to salsa at the condiment area.

When the bartender says it sucks, then the place must really suck.  A group of us went here on a Wednesday night and we were told that this place was really bumping before.  Two churches close by complained and the original owners picked up a left for a new location.  So whatever you heard in the past probably don't hold up to what it is now.  My co-worker that saw this place in the hey-day was really disappointed.
