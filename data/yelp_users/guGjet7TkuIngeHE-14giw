I love going here and taking pictures.   The last time I was there, I heard this beautiful flute music off in the distance.  I followed it all thru the gardens, back and forth, thru all the winding paths, until I came upon this lil old dude sitting on a blanket with all these hand carved Native American Flutes laying about.  Stayed a while, chilled and soaked up the ambience.  A beautiful day for sure. .

These dudes customer service was top notch!  Needed repairs on my beach cruiser and these guys rocked it!  (And they have some really cool bikes in there too.)  If you just happen to need one of those $6000 - $8000 dollar bikes, they got 'em!

Turned a friend on to this place a couple of weeks ago.   We had the Ethio Strictly Vegan Combo.  We picked:  Shuro Watt Dubba Kik Alitcha Misir Watt Kik Misir Watt  ....and also we had the Vegan Falafel Salad which was very fresh, and the presentation was a work of art. Kudos to who put it together.  Almost seemed a shame to eat it!   The server was prompt, very friendly, and extremely helpful when it came to choosing what we wanted to combo up.  I would not hesitate to come here again and would totally recommend this place to all my grass munching friends.  .

Found this place by doing some research on Vegan ink.  (Most places use ink with glycerine in it which is an animal by-product.)  Justin, the artist who did the work, is super cool and also a Vegan himself.  I'm really diggin my new tattoo.  .

Why is most of their organic produce shipped in from outside of the U.S.A?  Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Ecuador, etc etc etc.  Do these places have as high as or at least the same kind of restrictions or standards when it comes to growing "organic"?

Me and my son went in there on Saturday to catch a flick.   Had a while until the movie started so we went to the Starbucks in the same plaza. I had finished mine but he was still workin on his and he said he would bring it in to the movie and they better not give him any sh*t or else.  I told him what was about to happen but he didn't care and tried it anyways.  Which of course they promptly threw him out.  So, five stars because that was pretty funny.  .

If you need some brass knuckles, a switchblade, or you are under age and need some tobacco or sheesh, hit this place up.

Love this place!  Totally dig Sydney, she does a great job!  You just can't beat getting a razor shave, a hot towel, and a great scalp massage along with your hair cut for only $25.  I also like the conditioner, it makes my head tingle.

After getting a massage (and propositioned by two naked Asian "massage therapists")  (Oh no I din't!!!)  ~just massage my feet please~  I headed over here to try the veggie Ramen, and I have to say it was very tasty.  Almost as tasty as the intoxicating blonde who took my order.  Too bad she wasn't on the dessert menu.  All in all, a happy ending for sure.
