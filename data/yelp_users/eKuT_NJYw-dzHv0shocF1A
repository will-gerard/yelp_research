Usually a huge fan of this place, in fact it's one of the only chain restaurants I'm a big fan of but tonight was pretty disappointing. Food was good, service was terrible. Feeling rushed the 35-40 minutes we were there was not very accommodating. I had to ask 3 times to give us a few minutes to look at the menu, this all being in the first two minutes we were there. Dinner came and as soon as our plates were delivered we were asked if we were going to have a pazooki and what kind so our server could put in our order right away. Even after saying we wanted to eat our dinner first she insisted on putting it in because it takes 10 minutes. I actually like to enjoy my food and the people I'm with when going out to eat. The whole experience was rude. Will not be back at this location again.

Happy hour was pretty decent, service was on point...best part? Seared tuna salad! Definitely good enough to keep going back :)

By the far the most friendly chipotle I've been too! Everyone was more than helpful not to mention the food was amazing and fresh!

Went here for a quick lunch ended up waiting for 40 minutes for our entree salad took 20. Food was definitely not worth the wait. Server brought us plates with food on them and seemed annoyed when I asked for clean ones. Crostini that came with the salad was stale. I also asked for a peach tea that I never received. Chicken scalloppine was terrible instead lf it coming with marsala sauce it was drenched in oil. It's too bad this was such a bad experience. Desert ridge location is much better and the only reason I came to this location in the first place. Will not be back.

I decided to take my mom for her birthday dinner and was hoping for an amazing evening since most can agree...moms deserve the best. As soon as you enter through the door the ambience is instantly amazing. Service was more then we could of asked for. Very attentive and always looking to go out of his way to make sure we were happy.   We started dinner with martinis and appetizers. The calamari is a must try (different creative and delicious). I highly recommend the chilean sea bass, literally melts in your mouth and definitely the best i've had here in the valley. We got a few side dishes to share and investing in some jalapeno au gratin potatoes as well as the black truffle mac n cheese was definitely a good choice.   After dinner and without even asking (simply letting the hostess now via reservations we were celebrating a birthday) we were brought a few of their desserts. I am still dreaming about their home made peanut butter pie yummy!  The staff was amazing they genuinely enjoy making sure guests receive the best experience possible. Thank you Daniel and Paul for making tonight a memorable one! Overall the best birthday dinner I could of asked for my mom and more :)

The portobello mushroom chicken was surprisingly good, sweet potato was delicious. The service however was terrible. Good thing we enjoyed our food, not once did the server ask how the food was, in fact we didn't see her once after giving our order. Do not come here expecting above average service.

I really wanted to like this place! Before even trying it for myself I heard good things about this place, but the 2 out of three times I've been I have found hair in my food. Service was great all three times but the hair in the food just did it for me. I'm going to assume this happens often because of their dog friendly patio (where I sat all three times). They do have a great beer list and it changes weekly so if I do go back maybe I'll play it safe and just drink.

On the way to becoming a regular here! I recommend the BBQ chicken salad. So good and somewhat healthy. The chicken prosciutto sandwich is a good choice too. I always get the liver cleanse (fresh juice) it's delicious! They have a few other options as far as fresh juice and smoothies go. The only thing I would not recommend so far is the beet salad. The beets are boring and overall the salad is bland.
