Yellowtail sounds delicious! It is. With a very big but! This review is based on the class and price of this restaurant. The service was slow, and price was... Pricy (as to be expected in Vegas), but price should match service.   This place needs some work.  The food was delicious, but look at my picture of their salmon sushi, to know the portion size for the price.  If you're in Vegas find another place to eat.

Great Thai lunch spot! Staff is so friendly and quick service. Wonderful lunch specials with good variety and selections.  Their curries are all excellent along with my favorite, Spicy Thai Basil!  If you're in the area, definitely stop by Thai spices for lunch!

Great service, good food, great happy hour!  If you're in the area, head to Yellowtail for great sushi at a great price!  The service was excellent as we were greeted immediately, felt taken care of from the start, and throughout the meal.  Started with the spicy edamame, which is a delicious choice to start the evening!  Regular edamame was $2 on happy hour, but we opted for the spicy.  Domestic tap beers were $2.50. Can't go wrong.  Then ordered salmon nigiri, spicy tuna, and Vegas rolls all because we were hungry and they were on happy hour, $4 and $6 respectively.  Sat at the bar and watch NBA game 7, while eating wonderful food and cold beer.  Couldn't get better!  Make your way to Yellowtail for a great sushi experience!

If you are looking for a great eatery in Chandler look no further than barrelhouse!  I went yesterday and was so impressed I couldn't wait to go again.  The pork belly and local artichoke bruschetta were some of the best starters I've had.  Happy hour is everyday, giving you an opportunity to try all their delicious drinks and a variety of appetizers.    Everything on their menu is mouthwatering, the drinks are delicious, and the restaurant has a wonderful atmosphere.  On top of it all, the staff is friendly and gives a great feel the place.  When you are looking for a great restaurant in the Valley look no further than barrelhouse!

Great taco shop!  Good food, drinks, and sides with excellent service. Set in the heart of downtown Gilbert, Joyride is a great take on street tacos.  We started with the free chips and salsa (second order only $2) and some ceviche. The size of the salsa and ceviche was small and wasn't enough for two people.  Ordered three different tacos and a side of cucumber orange salad.  All tacos were good and the salad was excellent.  We ordered the fish taco, but they were out of it. Guess I should have went down the street if I wanted fish tacos.  The drinks are probably Joyride's best menu choice. We had the Cucumber Mint Agua Fresca.  Definitely our best decision.  With all the wonderful choices in downtown Gilbert Joyride is a good eatery, better drinkery, with five star service.  Stop by if you're into chips, salsa, street tacos, and delicious drinks.
