I've been to many zoo's across the country and this one was pretty good. I am a nanny and I have taken the kids I nanny for there and they love it! It does have a lot of areas in it just for the kids that don't even include animals which can be great! Especially the splash pads with our AZ summers! Bring their suits and some dry clothes. They have nice enclosures for the animals which are great to see the animals but they also seem very comfortable and natural for the animals as well I definitely recommend checking it out as a family, or adult! If you happen to be around during Dec-Jan definitely go see the zoo lights!

Always amazing! Always a wait! Well worth it! I usually order off their specials menu and get seafood and its always on point! The cactus pear margaritas are awesome and I get 1-3 every time! I have yet to try their brunch but heard great things! If you are visiting make it a point to eat here! Understand its not mexican, its New Mexico style which is spicy but flavorful! You can always try the Richardsons or Dicks Hideaway too. A lot of the same things on the menu. My dad always gets the green chile stew or carne adovada when he visits from Chicago which has become quite often since he found this place!

Avocado pizza was decent. The shop next store is very cute and a nice way to pass time while you wait for a table. Or if you go for breakfast its a nice way to pass a few mins.  I was disappointed the last time I was in as my order was completely lost and I patiently waited for about 30 mins and had to go up and reorder. But they did comp my meal so I'll let it slide this time :) But the breakfast I had was simple and healthy. Exactly what I was looking for that day.

Well hello newly revamped VI!! Very cute and modern. It moved it from 3.5 to 4 stars for that reason. I am not a person who is a fan of chains, more of a ma and pop type girl myself but when its done right, I've gotta give credit where its due. So I grabbed Easter brunch here because the other places I wanted to try was closed.  I had the healthy banana stuffed, strawberry topped whole grain pancakes. Very good! I didn't need butter or syrup which is considered a victory in my book! My family had this and thats which they enjoyed as well. My cousin had a skillet which looked much better than what I had experienced at Crackers and Co the day before! My biggest complaints have to be the fact that they use Minute Maid oj and the coffee was awful!!!! Seriously could have been the worst coffee I ever tried to choke down!! But mmmm those pancakes! The server was friendly as well which made things better.

Def one of the better if  not my best of the East Valley. The owners are very welcoming and its a nice quiet place. I'm a huge fan of fried rice and sweet and sour and they do both very well. I love the chips in the beginning and who doesn't love ending a meal with a fried banana delicious bite!! MMmmmmm Enjoy

Ok, so anyone who follows any of my reviews should know now, that I love deserts (chocolate especially), so of course I would end up reviewing here! I love the peanut butter cup perfection. But to make it that much better, add a brownie for like $.80. So worth it! Cold Stone has some great specialties, but come on people. Pay the extra for the extra fixin's and make it exactly the way you like it! Even try changing out the flavor of ice cream they use to make it taste different every time. I mean I'm totally a girl who fixates on one thing they love at a particular place, but even I, on occasion, change it up! Keeps my taste buds guessing (come on, you only live once)!! Just enjoy slowly the price and of course to curve brain freezes!!

I had the pork tenderloin, it was kinda salty. The garlic mashed potatoes were pretty decent. The green beans were very rubbery!! The server was pretty cocky but my grandparents like it here so I go! My grandma raves the Wedge but blue cheese isn't really my thing.

Always love coming to this location. Good service. Great pizza. I'm  crust lover and everything I've tried is great. I'm definitely a fan of the sausage there. I'm quite the pizza lover and there are a lot of let downs in the valley. This one has never let me down! Thank you Nellos

Ok, so I went here on a Saturday morning last weekend and it was awful. I loved that it was tucked away and had ample parking even though the lot was pretty full. I was seated right away. I ordered the cinnamon sugar french toast even after having my doubts from seeing it brought out to someone else. Ugh I hate when I don't go with my gut instinct against something!! It wasn't soaked with the batter all the way through so it was like dry bread on the inside. There wasn't enough cinnamon either. Not sure why it is allowed to carry that name or be on their favorites list! There was plenty to eat though, so if you don't require flavor, it will be filling. I began talking to a couple sitting next to me during the meal and they too were out hunting for a good breakfast in the east valley. He ordered a skillet. It didn't come out in a skillet and it was more like a stew than a skillet. It was so wet and disgusting. I hadn't gotten to her before they ordered so she had the french toast as well and it was just a bland for her. She covered hers in syrup and said it was much better that way but I believe if a steak is good you don't add A1 and if a pancake, french toast or waffle is good it doesn't need it either!! Not sure why everyone else had such a great experience here! Probably just all of my bad luck!

This is now called Pavilions Shell or Pavilions Auto care. It is no longer a 76. If you need to use your Conoco Phillips card, there is a Conoco off the Bee line (Highway 87) near Shea. They do great work at the shop. Eric and Ricky have been there for over 10 years! As has the manager of the gas station Carrie. The only of this location is a good person as well. I know this because I worked here for 2 years. It was a great experience. We do try to go above and beyond for you and we have many regulars who are just like family. I definitely recommend going there for auto work.

Its good don't get me wrong. I've heard there is a soup to die for but I have yet to enjoy that. The sushi is great but the sushi for what it is I think is highly overpriced. 2 rolls for me for $30 is a tad steep but then again...welcome to Scottsdale. You do get what you pay for.

A year ago someone hit my car in a parking lot and took off. My deductible was $500 and they managed to pay for my deductible because my car wasn't able to properly turn and my door woulldnt POW. They fixed it in 3 days and did a great job! You cant tell there was ever any problems! Thanks guys!

I do enjoy the italian bread here, but there isn't enough meat, cheese or topping to enjoy it! I definitely hate to say it but subway is just on the NW corner off the 101 and Shea. Its pretty expensive and not very loaded with toppings.

Best bagels in arizona!! They blueberry bagels with blueberry creme cheese is amazing!! They are fresh daily, never hard or lacking flavor. They owners are amazing and the people definitely are friendly and remember me no matter how often or little I am in there. The prices are right and they will go above and beyond to toast your bagel exactly the way you want it! Even the young people there are very friendly and inviting!! Check it out and hit the gym next door, to keep that spare tire at bay! ;)

This location is always busy, especially in the morning. It can take up to 20 mins to get through the drive-thru which is never fun when you are trying to get to work on time. And the parking lot situation is terribly done, totally not their fault obviously! But the employees who work there are absolutely awesome!!! When I was in there this morning my card declined and I had no other way to pay for it. She told me to keep my skinny latte and muffin and not to worry about it, it happens. But I swore up and down that I would be back and of course I was later that morning and I left a tip! I'm an honest person but some places would take your drink back and simply throw it away, but they understand their customers are not first timers and will be back! Not saying go there to try this, but its nice to know great people and decent companies still are to be found around the valley!   *update* I returned to pay my bill and they wouldn't let me pay for it! Apparently it was my 1 millionth visit freebie!

They have a great supply of fish coming in constantly. I also love that they take your fish you no longer want or need instead of flushing them!!! They have a great variety of larger tanks as well as varieties of fish food. They sell sugar gliders, chinchillas, and ferrets as well. Not overly priced for a pets store. I no longer have any of those things but I am here a least 2 times a month for a 3lb frozen rabbit. I have been disappointed as they don't always have the size I want but are good at having it for the next time I come in. Their knowledge and variety of reptiles is almost unbeatable this side of the 17. Their prices are the cheapest in the valley for live or frozen feeders (rats, mice, rabbits). I have spent hours in there before just walking around checking out all the new animals they have. They are very good at checking to make sure they are not selling you a sick animal or taking in any that are sick either! If you are going to be bringing something in to be looked at or sexed, it must be in a bag as not to spread any possible mites to their other reptiles!  This place isn't meant for the basic dog or cat owner so maybe the name isn't the most fitting, but for aquatic or reptile, stop by!!

I spend so much time on my tires and in my car with little time for TLC for it! This is the place to take it for just that! They have unbeatable prices in the valley! They were able to get me in immediately and had it finished in no time! Luckily I was in and out so fast I didn't unfortunately get to know any of the workers. But from speaking with them on the phone they were very friendly and helpful! I would definitely recommend them!

This is my favorite sushi restaurant along power rd. I have not experienced the sashimi yet unfortunately but have not been disappointed in the rolls. I had the rainbow roll there the last time and the fish was all very good. They bring you miso and salad with anything you order which is nice while you are waiting. It is a very small order place but definitely check it out for the food!

I love the margherita pizza here!! Right amount of sauce, chunks of mozzarella cheese, and big leaves of basil! Delicious, hot, perfect!!! They get their bread from the Breadsmith off Power and McDowell. Its great!!! They have great wine, pizza, drinks and desserts! Come check out this adorable place! There is a wait on the weekends so try and get in early on the weekdays!! Their cappuccinos are delicious with some decent tiramsu! Enjoy!!!  To bad they don't deliver!!!

They were very helpful yesterday, not just for me but with all the other customers. I came in to get some flyers printed up regarding my lost dog. They gave me previews of the b&w vs the color. They were all very helpful. There was a short wait in the checkout line but it gave me the opportunity to watch them with other customers. The female cashier gave them a very helpful description of how long they would need their Staples card until they would be in the system. She gave them the rundown of where to find specific needed information when registering their new printer and a basic step by step of how to install. Nothing she did was unnecessary or made the wait very much longer. They opened up another register to get other customers through and the managers were not impossible to find as they were out helping customers on the floor as well. I was very impressed with the customer service at this location and if you have any questions regarding copying or cropping, they can definitely do for you anything within their means.

I cannot give it 5 stars because the service isn't always amazing and the wait can be pretty long. But definitely 4 stars worthy because of the delicious garlic bread they start you off with. They have a decent wine and beer list. The salads are good, even better if you add chicken or salmon! I haven't had anything on the menu that wasn't worth trying. They do have some great Specials daily. The halibut cheeks are quite a fav! But I do wish they had more of a routine schedule because they have a great broccoli cheese soup (try it if its on that night). Enjoy your meal, just don't fill up on garlic bread!

This place is just cute good old fashioned fun! The ice cream is nothing to scream about but its a nice change of pace to the Dairy Queens, Cold Stones, and Baskin Robbins. Definitely a fun little place to take people visiting in town! I wouldn't necessarily drive out of my way to get there, especially because finding parking in old town can be a bit of a nightmare. But the prices are good, there is a bunch of video games in the back for the kids to play but the bathrooms are not so great! Avoid those is possible. But enjoy the cute Family Circus cartoons.

So happy I finally came!! This time, as I will b back, I had a Thai tea which was delicious with sweet and sour chicken that was better than most in the valley, loaded with veggies but a good sauce. There is so much that this place has to offer so I will def b back soon with new updates on the thai, sushi and vietnamese that this restaurant offers.

Your spine is not something you want to trust into just anyones hands! I got very lucky 3 years ago when I happened upon Darrin Walters and his staff in the yellow pages (though I don't recommend scanning yellow pages like I did! *I got lucky*) But as your fellow yelper...u can definitely take my recommendation!!   If you are looking for amazing chiropractic work, look no further! I live out in East Mesa and travel to North Scottsdale to see Dr. Walters! Everyone in the office is very outgoing and friendly! Its in an easy to find location right off the 101. They are very helpful figuring out what it costs you vs what your insurance will cover before you even go in! The massage therapists there are all amazing! Everyone has their own style and technique. I definitely recommend trying out a few to figure out who best fits your needs. They make you feel very comfortable. *Tipping is encouraged though not required* ;)

Very interesting sweet and sour had kind of a spice to it but good. The pork itself wasn't my favorite but it was good. The rice was very sticky. Unfortunately I had to get it to go so  I missed out on a lot that the great food specials have to offer. But I would def go again.

I have been coming here for years! The fried tacos are awesome and the margaritas are pretty good! I definitely don't come here because its fancy or anything but I believe its a step up from Filibertos (Filly B's)! The service is always great! I recommend this if you want real mexican food that isn't overpriced!

Got my first tattoo done here when I was 19. They took me in as a walk in and helped me feel very comfortable. It hurt like a SOB because I got it on the top of my foot. But he was patient and reassuring with me. It was clean, very cool decor and the artists are great! I'd definitely recommend it over Club anyday!

Toto we aren't in AZ anymore...it was like stepping into Connecticut! Very yuppy, sail boat outfits! Ok ok back to the actually experience, I called to make a reservation and they hadn't even written my name down until I came in and told them I called, so then we waited 5 mins. I ordered the raspberry white chocolate mocha which was pretty good and not overkill on the price. Then I had the blueberry girdie cake-no flavor! Bland blueberries and dry, not great pancakes. And if you didn't want some sort of egg dish, you are pretty sol!

Best BBQ I've had in AZ. I smoke meat every other month or so but love to be treated. Most places smother meats in crappy bbq sauce but they were really light on it and I got to enjoy the meat. I had the brisket and pulled pork. I have to say the brisket was hands done great!! The beans weren't anything special personally. But the corn was good as was the mac and chz and dear god how could I forget!!?? The corn bread! I'm super picky on corn bread but it was awesome! No honey needed! Def a cute set up as well. The little booths around the bar was great. And they have a dance floor at night on the weekends. Awesome place! Highly recommended!

I fought my love for the G-Spot but I give in!! I decided to spoil my family in East Mesa and brought home the largest container and loaded it up with my fav flavor rocher!

Best and only drive-in on the East  side. What I really like about this place is that it has several movies to choose from and you have to love the doubling up on a movie (even if you don't stay for the second) for oh so cheap!! Bring your own drinks and snacks and pick up some popcorn on location! Enjoy your evening in a truck bed, with some blankets, cards, etc...its fun! Wednesday is family night...even cheaper!!!

Probably some of the best quality sushi in the valley! I loved how quiet and not busy it was. They had plenty of rolls to chose from and the prices were not outrageous, they were actually cheap for such good fish! The flavors were good and the bill was $50 for 3 people to order 9 rolls!! Crazy good! It is definitely not somewhere to drop in quickly bc it does take a while to get the food to the table. Perfect for a night out with friends or a date to talk without being rushed or bothered.  I will definitely be back as soon as possible!!

Enjoyed the weather outside today and sat outside on the fake grass patio for lunch. I ordered the Oreganos fav Jr salad and the sausage pesto pizza, I did however manage to convince myself that I was too fat for a pizzookie(though I don't recommend you talk yourself out of it...I've been regretting since I left!) The salad was amazing like always. This particular pizza I tried for the first time! I loved the sausage, very full of flavor but could have had a few more on it. The tomatoes were good as well. But the pesto sauce...kind of lacking. Not too flavorful, couldn't really tell it was there. But I am never disappointed by the tomato sauce pizzas...do try. This location is great to visit because they are usually not "as" busy as the other locations.

I am a regular visitor to D'Vine! If you love a small place, with well done art by regular people thats for sale, live music regularly, great food for decent prices...than look no further in east mesa! The bruschetta is amazing! The caprese and prosciutto are my favorites but lucky for you, you get to pick 3 off their menu and you get a total of 6 pieces, 2 of each that you choose. The Scallop salad was amazing. The scallops were cooked perfectly and full of flavor. The dressing wasn't over powering either. The filets are always on the menu and are always amazing. If you split the meals, they don't charge extra but definitely give you a little extra of the sides to fill you up!  What I was never told about for the longest time was the wine club! If you have time for 2 bottles of wine a month than its worth the $30! On top of that you get plenty of extras including $10 off your first bottle of wine of every visit! The service there is always awesome!! They remember you and can joke around and enjoy serving you. Skip Caffe Boa next store...and come here!

Its a close 2-3 stars for this park. The main problem with this park is that they never have sections closed off like the park in Scottsdale, which totally helps with all the wear and tear the dogs make on it. This park is always full of mud, smells like piss and the water stinks too. I did have a dog bite my dog here pretty badly which can happen at any dog park but the particular owners did nothing about it, that can be very frustrating. But my lab loves to run off the dock after his ball here, so I do on occasion suffer this place.  I think there are many things that one must consider before going to the dog park. *your dog may be pushy with some dogs, you must run your dog down and control it, apologize immensely and be prepared to pay a vet bill if something goes wrong! *your dog may be pushed on. Do not take it personally and be prepared to pay a vet bill if everything goes wrong! *your dog may get very dirty, bring towels and still prepare that your dog ends up dirty! *be prepared for your dog to possibly bring home fleas, ticks, or new habits! *don't bring young children or food!

Definitely, good quick pizza. Inexpensive and filling!! Much different than the thin crust I'm used to but I still feel there are plenty of other pizza places to enjoy! I'm from Chicago, so I understand that everyone needs a different kind of pizza to keep them happy!

Its great for me that this is the closest, cheapest and healthiest desert location around! Their frozen yogurt is great! All the flavors appeal to one person or another. And they are changed daily, though they do carry the basic ones daily. I am a chocolate girl and they have different flavors and levels of chocolate everyday! They have a good variety of toppings as well. The best part is that they give you a stamp every time you go in, after 8 stamps you get a free small! If you buy a $20 gift card you get 2 free mediums. *Toppings are extra* Monday is family day, 4 mediums for $10! yet again toppings are extra! Tuesday is 2 stamps, so you buy 1 yogurt and get 2 stamps, 2 yogurts is 4 stamps...you get the picture. Well the best part for me is their mini size, its only 4 ounces (perfect for dieters and only $1.95) Definitely come by and enjoy what they have to offer!

Located off Hayden just S of Costco and N of Raintree Rd on the East side of the road. The parking lot is a little scary but there is a decent amount of parking. I called and ordered Pho soup for pickup and they said it would be ready 5-10 mins. When I arrived it was being wrapped up in the back. The man at the desk was very nice. They do delivery through a delivery company but they charge by distance I believe. The inside was very cute. The pictures make it look a lot fancier than it is, but most Vietnamese places are hole in the walls, so this was definitely a step up from that.  When I got the soup home it was still warm. Not hot or cold which was great. I added everything into the broth and the basil aroma just filled my kitchen. They did include a fork, spoon and chop sticks which was great. The flavors were all there but it definitely could have had some more basil, noodles and sprouts personally. I don't hold this against them though because delivery is always a little different than on location. I will definitely be returning! The price was great and the menu had plenty to chose from! They have been around since 2005 and definitely deserve to stay around!!

Their bread is awesome!! Its made fresh every night! You can actually drive by around 9pm and see them making the bread. They have different breads daily but have some daily. Unfortunately their hours are pretty short so definitely get in there. You can taste several of their breads everyday so the more you go in, you can taste test before buying the whole loaf. And when you buy 8 you get one free. Great deal! You can check out their website for all of the breads they have in detail daily.  http://www.breadsmith.com/locations/mesamenu.pdf

The fries garlic fries are amazing!! And the onion rings were pretty good. The burger I ordered was awesome! But I have to agree with some of the other reviews about the shake, it wasn't great but still better than DQ I highly recommend driving out this way to check out this place!! It used to be a house that was converted into this restaurant. There is a coffee house located on the same property but I was unfortunate enough to see it on the way out! So def check that out for me!!

So I took my family visiting from out town there and they were happy. You do get a good amount of food for the price and if you are smart like us, you can each order something different and be able try some of everything. I did get to experience the sweet potato fries this time...pretty good! They were a bit thinner cut than I would have liked but they had great flavor. Still I recommend coming to check this out if you are in the East valley, its one of the most fun flavorful places to be!

I'm giving this 5 stars only because I have yet to find anything better in the east side area. I have tried cupcake, lulu's, etc but this has yet to let me down. Partially because I'm a choco-holic!! And they carry the dark chocolate cupcakes everyday!! I personally have never had a problem with them being dry. There is a lot of frosting but lets me honest, you don't have to eat it all (better than there not being enough)! I definitely only recommend getting what you will eat that day because yes they are a little dry and harder the following morning! But they aren't filled with rubber crap like they do at grocery stores so they aren't meant to keep! I find it best to go there as an early date, like after lunch treat and hopefully find something to split, makes it easier on the wallet and the thighs!  Getting to it can be done by walking there from the Scottsdale Fashion Square mall or can be entered if you are driving North up Scottsdale Rd best. There are other ways but I won't go into that. There is a lot of parking in the back area, don't waste your time parking up front because it is kind of troublesome, don't make a $3 cupcake cost you a deductible for your car as well.

The only reason I'm not giving it 1 star is because I've been here before and experienced better! I understand that they "allegedly" were caught serving alcohol to a minor but seriously waiting up front and having to receive a wrist band to get one of the awful drinks was a waste of my time!! So yes the drink was awful! It tasted so fake and nasty! Bad cheap vodka. The salmon nigiri was bad bad bad bad bad!! OMG! BAD!! The playboy roll was not good either! It was an all around bad experience!! I may never be back here when their are several sushi places in the area that have yet to let me down.

I was really excited about this place because they don't start off with frozen meats like YC's does...unfortunately I've had better experience with YC's. I didn't really like the fact that I handed off my food and sat down because I'm pretty sure they poured another sauces on mine! I went with everything sweet and ended up with such a spicy meal that I had to stop eating it!! Big problem! It was nice that they give discounts to ASU students though. Not sure I want to go back and be disappointed...but we shall see, I am quite the forgiving person! Everyone makes mistakes! Just wish it weren't ALWAYS with my meals!

Have been enjoying Crust since it opened about 2 years ago. The pizza is very good!! Comes in a cute eiffel tower shape. The deserts are awesome and you can take them to go!! The wine selection is pretty small but they are choice bottles without being overpriced! The owners are very laid back but its a fun little small place.

This place is incredible! Just about every kind of liquor you can imagine! I love the writing along the walls as well, makes it less of a warehouse. If you are as big a wine drinker as I am than you are bound to find something you like as well as necessities needed for your glasses, storing or pouring. Have to love the 5 cents sales! They happen several times of year and if you join their email list, you get to check out the bottles and even have them pack things up for you in an hour and be ready when you arrive. And if you join their club you earn points towards reward cash. Check out the wine tastings as well.

Wow! Been here twice now and loved the bruschetta!! I'm having a hard time finding any the rivals it in this area! The service has always been great and friendly. I love the cozy atmosphere!! I go on mondays to get the $10 off bottles of wine. They have a pretty decent selection. I wouldn't say its the best place to come for dinner but to get $10 off a bottle, enjoy some bruschetta and talk its perfect!

The soup was no impressive!! There wasn't a lot of it and it was very oily!! Not a lot of flavor but they did win my heart over with the amount of basil!! Maybe it wasn't that great because I got it to go, but with so many other good vietnamese places near by-I'll pass!

Zushi has had quite a few ups and downs. Unfortunately they are very hit and miss. One thing I have noticed since new ownership has taken over is that they have a few new rolls. But the rolls aren't rolled tight and the fish isn't quite cut properly. I do love the atmosphere, especially sitting outside on the comfortable seats near the fire. But its just not all that great!

They mixed up my dogs information with a complete strangers! When my dog went missing they gave out the strangers information and my dog was only found because of craigslist!! What do I pay the city for???  And my other dog who got out, his information wasn't even pulled up when they scanned his chip!! And when I went to fix it..they even had him in the system twice!! WTF!  On another note...I did get her from the shelter and love her to death!! Got her on her last day!! And love her crazy butt dearly!

Ok so its great for how small ice cream shops go...but I didn't think it was anything insanely amazing. The variety and type of flavors are quite interesting and fun though. I def recommend people checking it out for fun.

The cheesecake is great! I have tried at least 10 of them. I defnitely recommend splitting one slice between 2-4 people! For the price, amount, flavor and calories its a great idea! Last night I tried the lemon raspberry cheesecake! Not too lemony and the raspberry sauce was great!! Always a ton of extra whipped cream!!! I tried the fried avocado rolls last night and they were good. The dipping sauce for them was even better! There were 6 slices per the appetizer. The seared ahi tatini was delicious but very small compared to the rest of their salads and was therefore a little overpriced for the size but the fish and dressing did taste great.  My grandparents had the seared salmon with veggies and potatoes. They said that it was amazing! The vegetables had great flavor! The hot chocolate was a very deep chocolate and the whipped cream was good but not quite hot enough! The service was pretty good but if you plan on coming here, avoid the weekends!

Delicious variety of oils!! Seriously loved the setup up and the oils and vinegars were great. I am almost out of a few and I'm pumped to go back and get more and then some! Highly recommended as its not the drive the Queen Creek Olive Mill is and honestly the Tuscan Herb oil is my fav oil to use on just about everything. And the variety of basalmics is much bigger and quite flavorful!!

This is such a fun relaxed place to eat!! I always sit at the bar because I totally enjoy watching them prepare everything. Maybe my review won't be the best for most people checking this place out...but I have never actually had a pasty but have been here half a dozen times. So for those who are too scared of the pastys or don't see something they like or just want to check out something else on their menu...I must say, try the artichoke, bowtie pasta salad!! Its amazing! The dressing is great, as well as the spinach, pasta and feta! I have tried to replicate this at home..no success. So if you aren't the pasty type, try the salad!!

I checked out this place with plans to get a shake! Holy cow!!!! $5.50 for a small! Are you serious? To top it off...my shake wasn't blended properly. I ended up needing a spoon. The ice cream was way too cold! She was having a very hard time getting it out to make the shakes. To get 3 shakes took 15 minutes because there was only one woman working there who moved very slowly! The tables were old and there was a leak in the room while it was raining outside. The ice cream was ok but the whole experience wasn't too great. I rather cold stone or marble slab.

Good oj. Good pizza sample. The cafeteria style is kinda cool but usually it can be so busy that its frustrating! The bacon is very thick which is a great change compared to all the greasy spoon breakfast joints. The oatmeal is good and hugely proportioned. The french toast is yummy as are the simple breakfast meals. The red potatoes are great!! It has a vegan menu as well. I usually get the iced teas they have on the counter which I think are great! The service is always great and I haven't really had any disappointing visits, can't wait to come back!

Well who doesn't love saving money! I only go to the big Pet stores when I don't have time to get to a pet club when they are open. I love saving $5-8 per bag of dog food, especially when you have big dogs! They carry a lot for cats as well. And leashs, collars and toys.

My experience here was not so great! The sandwiches lacked meat, cheese, ingredients and worst of all flavor!!! They were out of the kids meal items so instead of fruit she had a cookie and larger drink!! The sandwich I had was bad! And the sandwich Jared R ordered was loaded but he was not told that the 6 extra toppings were going to cost him over $2 extra!!! His medium sandwich was over $8!! Thats insane! Makes me see how much subway or even quiznos can be such a great deal!!

Oh god! No!! Terrible!! No flavor in the food or drinks! The margharitas were sooo weak!! Everyone I know who has gone hated it!! There are enough good Mexican restaurants on the East side don't waste your times here! But then again...its slim pickings this far out east mesa. The service wasn't great either.

Mmmm I life my weekly trip for my gelato here!! I have quite the sweet tooth and this definitely hits the spot! There are so many fruit and chocolate and candy flavors! Apple pie, pumpkin seasonally. The new dark chocolate is awesome!! Always have a fall back of the blueberry-amazing flavor and texture. I have been here dozens of times and still have plenty of flavors to attack! Check out they have delicious Italian coffees, vomma drinks and otis spunkmeyer cookies!!

Orange cake, carne asada, pork, Ahi tacos, fresh fruit, margaritas!! Need I say more. All fantastic. I loved the ahi tacos, followed bu the carne asada. A lot of flavor and perfect sized. I enjoyed ordering just one of each. The margaritas weren't that fantastic. The orange cake reminded me of a carrot cake but more refreshing :) the hotel is very cute as well. I loved the outside water feature. Unfortunately parking isn't the best but the food is worth the price.

I have not actually tried their pies but I did have a chicken pot pie. I wasn't very impressed. The pie crust wasn't very flaky it was a little soft and mushy. And the insides werent exploding with flavor or loaded with meat with I prefer. But it wasn't bad by any means either. Just different than I make and enjoy. Looking forward to trying a pie.

I am rating this store not for their computers but the Fun Friday's Microsoft days for kids. I brought my 2.5yr old here and she really enjoyed it. Its held every friday. After 3 visits she receives a gift bag and after 10 she receives free learning software. They sang songs, read a story and did a fun activity! I thought it was very interesting. Ages 1-5 I do believe and it starts at 1030am and runs till about 1115am. Enjoy!!

Ok so I had really high hopes for this place and felt pretty let down. I've heard tons of great things about the food, I just didnt have the same warm fuzzy feelings about it. It was nice to have good music but I felt it was too loud. I could hardly hear. I did like the art on the wall but unfortunately it wasnt enough to save itself. I am not a fan of cafeteria style set up. And the service was only ok. It just fell short of my expectations.

Ok I am not a Boa fan. I have been to the Tempe location and was not impressed. The menu is different in Mesa but I still was not happy. Of course who doesn't love getting 100pt at OpenTable and D'Vine was of course packed on a Friday night so I unwilling checked into Caffe Boa. The wine list is nothing impressive and there isn't many options as far as food goes. I ordered the California salad. Blah! The only part I liked was the avocado and I mean how badly can you mess up avocado, just pick up a ripe one and cut it properly! Congrats Caffe Boa, epic win on that! Other than that, overpriced and not the greatest flavor. I'll stick with waiting 30 mins for a table at D'Vine.

Ok so they are pretty pricey...but I pay out the *nose* for a good pair of jeans!! I thought the young woman who helped me was very nice, friendly and professional. I of course know my size and style so I don't generally need help but she did offer up some other styles that would fit similar to the BKE capris I picked out. The punch card they offer is pretty cool, you do have to spend a lot...but anything in there does happen to cost a lot!! I thought the store was very clean and professionally run, so congrats Buckle, I will be back!

Awesome!! Who doesn't love a $3 car wash with free vacuum. For someone like me who owns a husky, its so nice to have an unlimited time use on a powerful vacuum. Usually busy but I've never had to wait for a stall to start vacuuming! I come whenever I need a good hour to vacuum out my car!

I love Jamba juice! I love their morning breakfast smoothies (spoon required!) They are high in calories but you definitely need to jump start your morning with some calories and protein to jump start your metabolism. On the other hand, they have 3 great low calorie smoothies to enjoy and everything in between! Enjoy yourself a free boost! For the brave and health conscious, definitely take advantage of the wheat grass shots. The prices at Jamba are not high compared to some of the other smoothie places in the valley, after all fruit isn't that cheap! The people at this location were very friendly and it is a nice location away from all the crazy traffic of tempe with outdoor seating available. *for the smart and brave, order something off the secret menu..unsure of what I'm talking about, google and enjoy!*

This is 2.5 starts really. I just didn't really feel any of the food was overflowing with flavor. It actually really let me down. There are at least 4 other pizza joints I rather go to. Very cool how fast you can get in and out but the bruschetta was just...ok. The buffalo pizza was just sad. And the cannoli was a waste of calories. Decent set up but just not impressed.

I am a huge fan of the Italian beef and of course everyone is going to have their favorite places and tastes. But this seemed like a place to satisfy a lot of different tastes. There are several sizes, extra meat is available and if you are getting it to go, I'd say go for it! Only order it regular if you are a fan of super dry sandwiches. I'd say go for wet if you are like lightly moist but if you are a big au ju fan like I am, definitely hook it up with the dipped!! They have american, cheddar and provolone cheese (pretty sad they didn't have the mozzarella). They giardiniera was pretty good as were the sweet peppers. It wasn't too greasy or hard to eat while driving. They did have a variety of other things to eat so definitely check those out if you aren't up for a beef...but thats what they are known for!!

The peppermint was yummy and for only 32 cents and oz it was cheap too. Much better than some other yogurt places and there isn't any other one too near by so luckily its well done. Not enough fruit toppings though.

Such a great place! The happy hour is awesome! Who doesn't love 2 for 1!!! The fish is great quality and the rolls are well done. I love how different the las vegas roll here is (kinda hard to eat but very good!) The people who work here are very friendly and the live music on Friday is great fun. The food from other countries I have never tried but I hear great things! Check it out for me and let me know.

Smoothie beats candy any day. I'm a total smoothie freak. The menu is descriptive of what's inside the drink. Good flavor and usually not very busy so its easy to get in and out of there quickly!

Great flavors even though there aren't many to choose from! Fresh fruit is such an awesome feature as most places are def not and limited to the healthy choices of topping! I visit as often as I can!!

Let me preface this review by explaining that you aren't just paying for the amazing food that you get at ShinBay. You are paying for an overall experience and it is worth every dime! My fiancé and I had dinner here on a weekday evening late so it was not busy at all..in fact we were the only ones in the restaurant and what an experience it was to have the place all to ourselves. My fiancé had always been a very selective eater and wasn't open to raw fish when we met but has since been willing to try anything. And boy was he impressed and awed. Paying that much for a dinner was not his thing but by the last bite of dessert we were blown away, full and happy. Hands down a perfect romantic restaurant to enjoy each others company and the experience. You will not be disappointed by any part of this experience. Take advantage of this amazing place!

Horrible! The water smelled like fish and they didnt offer to bring more so we had to order drinks which they charged us for. We ordered 3 rolls and they brought us one wrong roll and then said they would take it off the bill but I had to wait an additional 10 mins for the correct roll and then they charge me for it. When I asked to speak to the manager, she was even more rude. She ended up not charging me for the roll bc she couldnt prove I was lying (after she went to look for the sheet of paper we filled out) and told me to make sure next time I ordered the right roll! The waitress never read back what we had written down in the first place which they almost always do at every well done sushi place I've been to so how would I even know if I wrote down on the wrong line. Yes people make mistakes on both ends but I know I didn't because I double checked but for them to be so incredibly rude was shocking! When the waitress brought back the corrected bill she didn't stop as she walked by she dropped it on the table. Never once apologized and to top it off the roll I had ordered was not good once I got mine when everyone else had already finished eating. I will never return and will for sure recommend going anywhere else!

From the time we ordered to the time the food was placed at our table was 30 mins! Then when our food arrived it was cold! All 5 of us had cold food. It was terrible! You can tell the potatoes weren't even cooked long enough, they were soggy and cold. I've eaten here many times, this was the least busy and the worst experience! Maybe it's not busy because they are starting to make so many errors! I'd recommend a dozen other restaurants over here any day now!
