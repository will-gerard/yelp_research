I've been in and out of this airport alot lately.   I decided to write a review after passing through today on another international USAirways flight.   I love their customs and immigration,  the baggage drop for those passengers connecting to a domestic flight and the fact that the international flight's exit is in very close proximity to the security check points!  Talk about convenient.  They have electronic kiosks in which you fill in your customs card and the kiosk prints it out for you.   The kiosk scans your passport and you have to hold still for a quick picture.   I was through customs in less than 20 mins and that includes waiting for my checked bag.     I also get my Bojangles fix when passing through here.   But let's keep that between us.   I don't want my trainer to find out.

****Entrance is in the back******  This an attractively unusual restaurant situated inside of what looks like an industrial strip mall with store fronts.  This place is not easy to see from the street because it is in the middle of this industrial looking strip mall.  Be mindful of that. The drive to turn into the rear parking lot is just west of the building.  The building is on the north side of McDowell.   This was the perfect place for a Sunday afternoon dinner.  A lot of families coming in for Sunday dinner and tons of laughter and friendly banter filled the room.  The menu is full of Sal Vadorian favorites and I had an interesting time perusing the menu for a selection.  I ordered 2 things.  I ordered El Plato Tipico and   Ensalada (not a salad, but a fruit drink with fruit in it.).    I especially enjoyed the flavors of the Ensalada.  It was surprisingly delicious and sweet. I don't usually care for sweet drinks; however, this drink was refershing and the sweetness wasn't overpowering.  The chunks of fruit was nice too, but caused a bit of a challenge when I attempted to drink from the straw.  One of the things I love about South American restaurants is that there is always some type of "typical meal".  At a Colombian restaurant, you order the Bandeja Paisa.  At a Guanaquito, you order "El Plato Tipico".   This dish comes with an array of things that allow you to sample some of the simpler offerings.  My favorite part of the meal had to be the cheese and meat pupusa,  This is quite similar to the Indian paratha in style, not in taste.... A pancake stuffed with goodies.  The pupusa was so tender and moist with the appropriate amount of cheese and the hints of meat.  I savored every bite of those.  I also enjoyed the tamales.  Their tamales are wrapped in banana leaves and was the most moist and tasty masa I have had in ages.  I wasn't crazy about the chicken, I wish I'd gotten a pepper or veggie tamale, but ... still very tasty.  Return Factor 100%.

What a fantastic meal I had.  I've been desiring amazing Mexican restaurants in Arizona.  Since I moved here, I've been to several places that were underwhelming, at best, and generally just not good to me.  So, I'd given up on Mexican Food in AZ and I just didn't eat any.  Well, a conversation in Yelp Talk about Mexican Food inspired me to check out some different places and this one turned up in my searches on Yelp and other websites.  I'm happy to say that I was so thrilled and enjoyed my meal very much at Mariscos Playa Hermosa.  Again, another hole-in-the-wall, but still quite the find.  Mariscos is located in a pretty seedy part of town, so don't get nervous going there.  They close early, so you'd better arrive early.  You will find that there is a full bar inside this colorfully decorated resto.  Don't eat at the bar.  That things not suitable for anything except decoration as the bar itself doesn't extend out far enough to make it comfortable to sit there.  (this is a tip from a person who opted to sit at the bar)  I tasted a few items off the menu.  The shrimp in diablo sauce was my favorite.  I ordered extra diablo sauce on the side.   The sauce has a smokey taste with the heat of the peppers.  Perfect for my heat seeking taste buds.  They prepare the sauce "fresh to order".So there is a charge for $3 for the extra sauce on the side to go.  I used that sauce to make more shrimp diablo at home later that week.    I also enjoyed the camarones culichi... shrimp in green sauce.  Culichi is a tomatillio sauce made with some dairy product and cilantro and of course the poblano or tomatillio peppers.  The sauce is simply to die for.  I left there satisfied and happy!    I will return and take a friend for the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce.  Can't wait.  I'm sure it will please.  They have a check-in offer too, so be sure to check-in.  Oh, that parking lot is TINY.  Be aware of that when you go.

I go here for my bacon.  AT 5.49 per pound, this bacon is cheaper than most bacon in the stores.  I love the taste and flavor of the bacon.  I know that they have handmade sausages, but I'm not into sausage.  HA!  An interesting fact...   you can customize your sausage recipe there... so bring in your recipe and order your sausage.    They also carry a variety of deli meats.  I love to try the samples, but I have not ordered any of their deli meats.  Return FActor: 100%  FYI: they have a $5 minimum on credit card purchases.

Stopped in here yesterday to give a try because fellow Yelper Anthony P swears by the fries and this place is so much closer to me than Port...'s (not long because the Tempe location opens Sept 10).  (I also hate to mention a competitor in my reviews, thus the abbreviation)  So went with a very close and dear friend visiting me from out of town.  She wanted a Chicago-style polish sausage and it was dinner time, so what a great opportunity to stop by Luke's.  I love Italian Beef sandwiches, so Luke's was the perfect place to stop in.  My friend ordered the polish sausage.  She was so satisfied with it that she wanted to go back the next day and have another.  I put a quick stop to that.   But we'll return before she leaves.  My friend said that the Polish Sausage was better than alot that she'd had in Chicago when she lived there.  I had the Jr Italian Beef and whoooooooo wee.  Lemme tell ya.  That thing is amazing and the Jr is HUGE.  I had it for dinner and lunch the next day!  Definitely the best in Phoenix and quite possibly better than most that I have had while I lived in Chicago too.  The bread is quite delicious.  I'm not a big bread eater, but a little dippy-dip-dip of the sandwich in the au jus and I have to sample the bread a little bit.  See, the Italian Beef is on a very dense bread that can hold up to single, double and triple dips in au jus!  Trust me when I say this, if you don't get your Italian Beef dipped, you're missing out on something special!!!!  I also had the giardiarano peppers on my sandwich.  Those were tasty but with little to no heat.  Not the best I've had.  The star of this sandwich is quite frankly... the beef.  Where's the beef?  Oh, Luke's has got it baby.  The beef on that Italian Beef melts in your mouth real real good while exploding with mellow saltiness and HUGE flavor in your mouth.  OH!  Goodness, I could scream that beefy goodness was just delicious!  The best tasting Italian beef I've had in a long long time.  Better tasting that Port..'s.    This place is conveniently located right off the 51 on Indian School.  Very easy to locate.  Look for the sign with the little Chicago Gangster on it and the Pepsi products on the sign (they have 7UP, RC cola, etc).   It is a small place, so I would not say it is good for large groups.  But certainly you can go with a group of 6 or less and should be comfortable, provided they don't have a crowd already there.  The menu has a lot more to choose from, ever heard of a Chicago style hot dog?  Uhm yeah... i've heard Luke's dogs are good too!  They close fairly early, 8pm.  So, why the 4 star, well, I docked them for the lack luster peppers and the fries.  My good Yelping buddy Anthony P swears by these fries, but the fries were just *aight* for me.  So, I had to dock them for not providing an all around amazing experience.  BUT still... my friend and I are returning this week.... for round 2.  Trust me... That thick giant beefy sandwich is worth it... and my friend likes the polish sausage too.  TWSS.

8/17/2013  Bfast club UYE with many many Yelpers today.  Great event.  I was very happy that I got the chance to have b'fast with 2 yelpers I have not seen in a while, Joan G and Meagan G - so nice to see these ladies!     I had the egg-white omelet.  That was fantastically delicious.  A lot of people love their English muffins too and they sell them by the half-dz.  So, I am finally, after 4 years of shopping here, writing a review of LGO.    I love coming here.  Everything about this shop screams hipster and I like hipster stuff too.   I love the lunch salads.  Their salads are often creative and delicious with fresh local ingredients.  Just grab a salad from the cooler in front of the main counter.    I love the pizza.  IN fact, the pizza here is some of the best in the valley to me.  The star of their pizza, to me, is the delicious crust!  the crust of their pizza has an appropriate balance of crisp and chewiness.  I have also enjoyed some of their cookies.  Certainly the last Yelper Cookie recipe in July 2013  was the best cookie I've had from their Bake Shop.  I know they sell wine and a bunch of other stuff.  I always feel like I'm running into stuff on displays for sale in there; but to be honest, I've never paid that stuff any attention.  I don't know what is on those displays in that store.  When I was in there today, I noticed a children's book on one of the shelves and remembered thinking, odd.  But maybe people buy them and read those books whilst they eat lunch. (?).    The parking situation at this corner of Campbell and 40th street is typical of most central phoenix eateries - frustrating, limited, best-to-valet - to name a few adjectives.  Which is why I normally get what I want from LGO to go.  They have convenient "to-go" parking spaces right in front that are almost always vacant.  I park, run in , grab what I need and come right back out.      Until this morning, LGO certainly had a round-up-able-to 5 star rating in my book.. I had to knock them a star for the following TWO  reasons:   #1 this place doesn't lend itself to large groups at all if you come for lunch or breakfast.  No reservations.  Just dispatch your buddies to hold seats with cell phones, napkins and whatever else you can use as place holders.    RCV Alert:   #2 They got rid of or lost the Tammie Coe Cake's  Red Velvet Cupcakes.   I came to know TCC's RVC when I stopped in to have lunch at LGO once and that's where my love of TCC's RVC originated.  When I stopped in some time ago and saw the RVC cupcapes in the display.  I instantly knew something ewas off/wrong.  It didn't look like my beloved TCC RVC cupcake.  I inquired about the cupcake and why it looked different.  I discovered that TCC's was no longer being sold there, a person working at the counter told me LGO's RVC was just as good as TCC's.  Uhm, Houston, we have a problem, that sales person MUST have fallen and bumped her head!  I don't think so.  I've tried the RVC made by LGO's bake shop 3 times to see if it came close, the cake itself is not as good as TCC's.  The cake itself lacks the appropriate flavor.  The taste is off..  The cake is moist enough, and the texture is just right.  but the lack of enough flavor is where they loose the battle.  The cream cheese frosting is perfectly done.  If their cake's taste popped more, they'd be in a position to take on my #1 RVC in PHX.  Certainly a contender in my Top 5 favorite RVC's in Phoenix.  .

2 stars because I would never come back,  there are better ways to consume 10000+ calories.     I am sitting in the restaurant writing this review.  I've passed this place several times and the parking lot is usually full.   I figure with 4 starts on Yelp,  it might be worth a try.   I ordered the western burger and fruits.   Maybe I should have tried the sliders.  I'm not sure.   The burger patty seemed like it was pre-made and frozen.   But what really killed this was the bacon that was as tough as jerky.   The French fries were uninteresting.   I wanted to enjoy this so bad.   I'm a little disappointed I came here on a whim,  especially since I had left over Salmon cooked at home.   Oh well...     I feel like I've been cheated out of "cheat calories".     Return factor: 5%

The Travis L. Williams Post is a great venue for community and neighborhood events.  Some people know this place as a place where people can go and party and drink.  Don't get me wrong, they certainly do have their party nights here!  But this party spot also supports the community by allowing community organizations to host events in the location with little to absolutely no hassle.  They have hosted community events such as election watch parties, private parties, sorority/fraternity fundraisers and wine tasting fundraisers.  For that, I give this place 5 Stars.    My favorite time to go here was on Wednesday nights for the line dancing practice.  I haven't been in a couple of months, but I would substitute a workout in the gym for a trip to the Legion to learn line dances and kick up my heels.  Awesome environment because I can go in my jeans or work clothes and put on a pair of heels.  No worries about if I'm dressed to the nines and I can dance for 2 straight hours!  Whoooweeee!  that's the best time for me.  The ladies on the dance floor kicking up their heels and helping each other get the steps right while the men sit around the bar sipping their cocktails and chatting it up.  I know on other nights there are dance classes there as well.    I've also been here a time or two on the nights when the Legion actually operates as a club.  This is why I kick down the review a notch from a 5 star.  The Legion as a club serves it's purpose.  It is an around the way, club and you get an "around the way experience" at the Legion.  If you are from around the way, you'll enjoy it.  That said, you know the drinks are strong enough to leap tall buildings in a single bound by gholly!    The food is that of a neighborhood club with a kitchen...  I love it that, there's a kitchen in the club and a window where you order the food from.  They have fried wings and fish.  I'm not even sure if they serve anything else.  That's because I've never ordered anything else!  haha... I love good wings and the Legion's wings are that - Good.    NOTE: when I've gone on non-club nights, the kitchen and bar are usually open.  The Legion is one multi-faceted facility.   If you are on that side of town or you cater to the folks in that area, or if you're just looking for a venue that is low-hassle,  this could be a facility for you.  Drive by there and check them out.

The unfortunate experience of having a tire issue while you're far away from home or when you are close to home can be completely stressful.  I pulled into this Tire Discount without an appointment on a Saturday and they were able to work me in to their busy schedule.  I was extremely appreciative of the fact that they kindly took care of me.  They were not generating business from me because I bought my tires from a different Discount Tire store, so the repair to my tire was free.  I was very happy with how attentive my repair-person was.  The salesperson told me about how long I would have to wait and I didn't wait any longer than that.  They took the time to show me what caused the issue with my tire before repairing it.  I liked that a lot.  They fixed my tire and sent me on my happy merry way.  I would definitely go back to this tire shop!  No one wants to come here with out an appt, but if you have a tire emergency, then this is the way you want to be treated!  Although, if you can, make an appointment so you can be at ease when you show up.

I'm mortified!  I've never written a review of the Farm at South Mountain?  I'm not sure how this is even possible!  I go here so often that this might actually be my favorite place in Phoenix to go for a relaxing cool/warm Saturday or Sunday afternoon in PHoenix.  In fact, I think I'm headed there momentarily.  Many people write reviews for the various "businesses" at the Farm on South Mountain on the wrong Business/Venue pages.  But I guess this listing is a catch-all for everything.  Let's see if I can help people get this clear.  I really want to point that the Farm at South Mountain has several "businesses" and venues listed on Yelp.  You can go here for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  You can have your baby shower here or your 200+ person wedding and reception here.  You can hold a corporate event in "Stoned Grove" area around an outdoor pizza oven or you can have an intimate dinner under mature trees with glimmers of stars at night at Quiessence.  This place is a one stop shop for everything simple and beautiful in the out of doors.  I've written reviews for a few of the places on the farm and I will let those reviews speak for themselves.  I've posted pics too...   One of the things that the Yelping community might appreciate knowing is that you should visit their website for special events.  Sometimes, they have special Farm dinners.  Sometimes there's a special holiday dinner or lunch.  For instance, I know for Valentine weekend, they have Valentine Dinners and Picnic lunches.    Here are my reviews of places on the farm:  Maya's Farm (At the end of the Farm Drive and directly North.) Organic Certified Farm.  See them at the Farm on Sunday mornings.  Phoenix Public Market on Saturdays and also get on their CSA)- http://www.yelp.com/biz/mayas-farm-phoenix#hrid:5dPGtdn4SQIClbJ_uIe1zw  Succulentia (it is in the green house on the north side of the farm, back by Maya's garden House) http://www.yelp.com/biz/succulentia-phoenix#hrid:Z91CIQ4jVqF9RG3HrRe22w  The Farm Kitchen  (Lunch/Brunch and is the closest to the Picnic Tables.  you see it immediately as you enter the farm, north of  "The Farm Driveway".) http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-farm-kitchen-phoenix#hrid:7w3mgerwC9Yqd_b1amkDjA/src:self  Morning Glory  (Breakfast only, but the patio is a nice place to rent for an event.  Go All the way to the end of the Farm Drive and YOu'll find it.) http://www.yelp.com/biz/morning-glory-cafe-phoenix#hrid:yzI8RxBsNlKndP1HMQ0Q6A   There are a few other businesses on the Farm listed on Yelp Weddings: (I am sure there was a wedding listing on Yelp for the FASM because I used to check in to it accidentally when I first started Yelping.  If I find it, I will update)  Quiessence (I haven't written a reveiw of this either.  SMH!!): http://www.yelp.com/biz/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix  Botanica (Been here once, but no review) http://www.yelp.com/biz/botanica-phoenix-3  This is a great place to visit after you've completed a Hike on South Mountain too.  Enjoy.  Thank me later.

This is absolutely as Good as it Gets wrt Views of Phoenix.  SMP absolutely deserves all 5 stars and then some.  This happens to be the ONLY 5 Star place I can write about that I can say, I've never driven all the way to the location.  Haha, it's because I'm terrified of driving up that narrow winding road.  Oh boy, talk about scary.  I love to take all of my out of town guest here.  Well, as far as just before the road begins the ascent, then I notify the passenger(s) that someone else needs to drive the rest of the way up to the top!  haha!  Great hostess, right?   Oh well, YOU can take Central Ave south as far as it goes, and you will be at the top of Phoenix!  If you're squeamish, I recommend hiking up there or riding.  Now, I've hiked south mountain.  My favorite hike was the National Trail Trek  last year.  What fun was that!  This is one of the best organized hiking events I've attended.  Google this event and get on their email list.  You must register for this event the day it opens or you won't get in.  This is one of the most beautiful hikes.  The National Trail runs along the top of the ridge and the views of Phoenix are stunning.  The National Trail is about 15 miles long.  Not the typical out and back length, but there are several smaller trails that you can hook on to the National Trail to do a portion of it.  I've done trail running along some of the trails on South Mountain as well.  I usually enter from the Ahwahtukee side for the trail running.  There are always a lot of people out there doing various things.  I see people cycling.  Iv'e even seen a group of guys headed straight down in what I called a death wish on a very rocky side of the mountain.  I've also seen horses on the mountain.  Not for me, but maybe for you!   For the novice, I recommend preparing well for your visit to the mountain by bringing water, proper clothing.  People actually get lost over there.  which is quite strange, but it happens.  don't underestimate proper preparation.  good luck!  YOu will love it.

Why on earth would anyone come to this location?    I don't know where to begin with my issues with this establishment.  From the salad bar that needed maintenance to the restrooms.  This is a place with kids, most of the them under the age of 12, the bathrooms need to have a regular schedule for cleaning and restocking, especially on the weekends!  Kids in general are messy, but now you have a couple hundred running through a restroom, it needs to be cleaned regularly.  I was so disappointed to see that the staff only appeared for the birthday party and to drop off food, but when I looked around, I only saw one person out sweeping and trying to clean up and the person at the entrance.  Other than that, I would occasionally see a person come from the back and look around and go back to the back..  You have kids running around wildly.  Everyone at work that's not cooking should be out trying to man the restaurant floor.    Hand sanitizers ran out in the play area, but people working there were waking around doing nothing.  I will return if a kid I know is having a party there, but I won't be eating the food.

A teacher's Paradise and a place parents should love too.   This is a very neat and well organized store with school supplies.  Lots and lost of school supplies.  From very early development through at least middles school.  I don't understand the method behind the way that it is organized.  But I know that the staff was able to help me find things I was looking for and I had no idea of the name of some of the items.  "Uhm, I'm looking for this card that teachers put stickers on for little kids.  They collect stickers on them as rewards..."   That my dear Yelper is called, "an Incentive Card".  But my point is that  I was looking for several things to donate to a school, but not being a teacher, I had no idea what those items were called.  The staff in that store was amazing.     They have a rewards buying program, so be sure to ask for the card.  I'll bet anything the sales person won't forget to suggest it.  I have heard some people complain that hte prices are too high.  I comparison shop just about everything on Amazon.com and I found the prices for the items I went in there to buy were comparable.  (If someone knows of an online site that offers cheaper than here, PM me.)

I've been trying to shrink my "To-Do"/"Bookmark" list on Yelp.  Shimogamo was on my list for quite some time and I was happy to stop by late last year!  I really wish that I had gone long before.  This is now my favorite place for sushi in the valley and I keep going back and forth between 4 and 5 stars.  Let's see by the end of the review where I'll leave it.  Shimogamo sits in a strip mall at the corner of Warner and Dobson Road, just barely inside of the Chandler city limits.  It share a wall and a door in that wall with a popular DimSum restaurant.  I have assumed that the 2 are sister companies because of the door.  Shimogamo is definitely a modern day sushi/Asian establishment with a modern feel to it.  It can appear kind of cold, but I guess when you're dealing with sushi, you need things to be cold.  Needless to say, I think that this place is fantastic.  One of the things that I like about Shimogamo is the fact that the quality of the sushi is stellar.  The fish that they use is incredibly fresh.  The sushi that I've tried is unique and creative.  My favorite roll is the Big and Spicy Roll.  It lives up to its name too!  While just spicy enough for me, the smokey oil marinated jalapeno's may be a bit much for others. Since size does matter, this big role is a perfect fit for my appetite!    I love to eat Black Cod cooked in Japanese restaurants....Amazing delicate and flaky.  Seasoned well and simply delicious!  Shimogamo did not disappoint.   The service is attentive and professional.  They have a large room in the back from a semi-private dining experience for large groups.  The best part about Shimogamo is I spend less money here than I do in other sushi establishments in the valley, but I have had a far better experience with respect to flavor, creativity and freshness!  I've decided given the quality of their sushi and the price... this is the best sushi in Phoenix.  If you disagree, send me a compliment with your suggestion.

I went here to celebrate my birthday.  First let me say this, the service in this place is impeccable.  I've had very few establishments serve me in such fashion and I would be surprised if an establishment could top the quality of the service in Kai.    Off the bat, i'm giving this a 4 because I wasn't thrilled with the food that I had.  I would recommend arriving about 45 mins before your "just before sunset" reservation so you can sit in the lounge area outside of the entrance to the restaurant and have one of the original, creative cocktails.  Wow, what flavorful and different cockatails!    Make your reservation for "just before sunset" so that you can stare loving at the beauty that the dessert has to offer at the right hour where the earth glows from the beautiful oranges and reds from the setting sun.  I would also recommend, if you are not staying over night, to plan to stay 45 mins after dinner to walk around the hotel terrace area.     I will update more....

Carrabba's is my favorite chain restaurant business - PERIOD.  This review is for this location, specifically because I think that the food prepared in this location is better than in other locations.  I eat out a lot and because I love local-fare, chain restaurants are definitely not on my to-eat-lists.   However, this Carrabba's is frequently in my rotation for 2 reasons - #1 I really love a few of their menu items and #2 the service.  So, the food is always good here.  I've never had a bad meal and from my experiences with other Carrabba's across the country, I think this one prepares their food the best.  Now, on to the meat of my review - the service in this establishment is impeccable.  I've gone in here on more than one occasion and ordered things that were not on the menu - if they have the ingredients in house and can make it - its a done deal.  You know how you DVR a show and watch it 3 months later and see a commercial for something "new" Carrabba's is serving and get there and it is no longer on the menu?  I can't tell you how often that has happened and how often I was able to get the item prepared for me.  I've been there and had the manager offer to make a shrimp item with the shrimp prepared 3 different ways.  WHO DOES THAT?  I was there for lunch recently with a friend and I overheard a manager telling a customer that this restaurant never had a particular item on the menu, but they have all the ingredients.  He informed her that the dish takes a while to prepare, so if she would call him an hour in advance, he could have it ready for her when they got there.  Uhm... Yeah.  That's  why this Carrabba's gets a 5 star from me.    There are only a select few National Chain restaurants I would choose, this Carrabba's is one of those when I'm in Phoenix.

Spaghetti... meat balls.    I stopped in here with a friend because we were both hungry and this place was convenient for us.  The service that I received was nice and I enjoyed my server very much.  I was really sad that the place that advertises "Spaghetti ... meat balls" didn't nab at least 3 stars from me.  I suppose it is an uphill battle for any Italian restaurant because I don't eat pasta.  *gasp*  I know.  I just don't eat it.  I think pasta is a bunch of empty, tasteless calories.  Yikes.  So, when I go to Italian restaurants with friends, I always order any pasta dish w/o the pasta sub a veggie or lettuce.  I don't mind paying extra for what I want.  This is the first establishment that I've been told that wasn't an option.  I just don't see why not if you're making the ingredients to order to put OVER plain pasta or tossed with plain pasta.  Why can't I have it "OVER"/"with" anything I choose if I'm willing to pay?  I would have loved to have ordered the roasted asparagus with the Bolognese, I'd imagine if the Bolognese is half way decent, it would have been awesome with that bread.  IDK.  But, that's the way they choose to run their business and I was fine with that.  The server was kind enough to point me to some other options on the menu that did not have pasta in them. Great, I can work with that.  I went for the Asparagus Fra Diavolo with roasted chicken and the Mista Salad.  The Mista Salad was delicious.  I believe I had it with their house dressing.  YUMMY house dressing.  I also dipped their bread in the salad dressing.      Oh wait.  How could I forget the bread.  Wowzer!  Their bread that they serve prior to the meal is simply divine.  Warm, moist, soft and tasty.  Very good.    So, back to the Asparagus Fra Diavolo with roasted chicken.  I just simply didn't enjoy it.  It didn't taste good to me.  :-(  My friend ordered the Jambalaya and that tasted pretty good to him.  I have heard the east VAlley location was good, so maybe I can give that a try some day.  Sadly, this was likely my first time and my last time here.  I didn't get to find out if Spaghetti enjoyed "meat'ing" Balls or not... So sad.  BTW, they have a very nice patio dining space.

Staycation's all I ever wanted.  Staycation had to get away!  And Happy happy happy I did.    I stayed at the Wigwam for the AZ Jazz festival this past October.  One of my most memorable experiences about this resort was the fact that I arrived after dark on the first night.  I went to the first concert that night and enjoyed the evening.   I didn't think much about the property at all.  I woke up the next morning to take a walk around and see what I could grab for breakfast.  I walked out of my casita to find that that resort is a green lush of beauty suitable for the most discerning eye!  I was WOWed by how well kept the property was.   The property is well manicured with beautiful huge palm trees everywhere.      I was very pleased with the quality of service I received at all the various points that I interacted with the staff of the Wigwam.  From the housekeeping to the bar/restaurants to the bell hops who shuttled us around in their golf carts (yes, you can call the bell hops to pick you up or drop you off).  The staff was catering to thousands of people on the property there for the AZ Jazz festival as well as the hundreds of patrons who were actually staying at the resort.  I think that everyone I encountered handled that influx of people well.  Albeit, the rooms are somewhat outdated, you're not staying in an actual wigwam either!  The rooms were fairly large.  Actually, in comparison to a standard hotel room, these rooms are pretty large.  All of the casitas have these wonderful patios and my friends and I sat out there and chatted in the AZ sun!   Keep in mind that this is a historic hotel.  There are a lot of fun facts to learn when you are walking around the hotel about the hotel and the city of Litchfield and Goodyear.    There are several food options on the property and several that are right outside of the gates of the property on Old Litchfield Rd.  Since I never moved my car the 3 days I was there, I did eat at all of the resorts restaurants and some along Old Litchfield.    I realize this is getting long!  But there are a lot of things I loved about this place.  I loved the fact that the main house/lobby of the resort has all these little conversation nooks all over the place.  The lobby, if you can call that a lobby as it is huge, is so cozy and has a delectable southwestern theme to it.   Property - 5 Stars Rooms - 3.5 Stars Food Options - 4 Stars Quality of Service - 4 Stars. Golf  - ?? I'll try to do that when I return.

This is one of the most beautiful and peaceful places in the valley.  I've had the privilege of visiting this resort on a few different occasions and for a variety of reasons.  From the stay perspective:  Native American themed room. Nice comfortable bed. Very lovely and spacious room with a beautiful balcony.  Wonderful radiantly beautiful sunsets everyday in the desert.  From the Dining and Entertainment:  I've been to all of the restaurants in the resort.  Kai lives up to its name and reputation and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting the resort or the casino.  I've come for cocktails on the patio and sat outside by the fire pit.  This is my favorite part of this resort.  That terrace/patio is just fantastic.   The walkways to the rooms are laced with benches for quiet moments and conversations and to steal a moment just before sunset.  From the Events perspective:  I've attended a couple of meetings and most recently, the Fashioneta Fashion show.  I will be honest, for the table service during the fashion show, our server was quite rude and unpleasant.  But in general, during other events, the staff has always been pleasant to me.  The facilities are beautiful.  This is one of my favorite places to go to in the valley.    Return factor: 100% .

The people complaining about the way Chars looks have no idea what a Juke Joint (or a Honky Tonk if that's your flavor.  Dive Bar if you can relate to that) is supposed to look like.  The lights are supposed to be dim.... the place is supposed to be small... The place will have a band that doesn't care if their makeup is on correctly.... the place should make you question if the walls might fall down if the music gets any louder and the dance floor should be small as JUKE JOINTS are usually kinda small!!!!!  Somebody please educate these folks on JUKE JOINTS.... Meanwhile, let me tell you about Chars.  If you're looking for absolutely NO pretentiousness, NO frills, Tables that don't cost $600, or basically the opposite of clubbing in Scottsdale .... Chars is your spot.  If you are interested in Rhythm and Blues and Soul covers and a rocking good time.... Chars is your spot.  If you are looking for a live music venue where people dance AND mingle with each other and actually speak and talk to you just because... Chars is your spot.  If you have stumbled upon my review because you are looking for a decent time.... Chars is your spot.     I absolutely LOVE Chars for everything that it is AND for everything that it is NOT.

For my 200th review, I have chosen to write about a place that has been a place of joy for me as well as a place of therapy.  I first came to know the AZ Humane Society via a Yelp community service event in which we came in to make blankets for the cats.  I used to take my dog JackJack here to play in their outdoor runs that are open to the public from daylight til 12 noon.  My dog and I would stay for very long periods of time.  I found that those dog runs were very under-utilized and we enjoyed them.  The dog parks/runs were always very clean.  The water was always on and worked well.  Even if you don't want to use the dog runs, the property is huge and you can bring your dog there to walk for change of scenery.  I always brought my own poop-bags, but I think that they may even have poop-bags that are for the public.  Since it is a non-profit, it is probably best to bring your own.  When my dog died, I came here for the pet grief group that meets on the first Wednesday of every month.  I came to learn of the Pet Grief group from my visit with Yelp.  When a pet dies people who have never loved a pet in the way I loved my dog JackJack just don't understand the pain you feel.  I really felt so isolated and in the most pain of my life.  I was so happy to be among others who could relate to my pain and who could help me make sense of what was such a shocking feeling of pain.  The group is run by a pet chaplain who leads the discussion.  Being a scientist who is very spiritual, I honestly didn't know what to expect from a pet chaplain, but I was so pleasantly surprised to find a kind and understanding person who made the pain of losing my very best friend more understandable to me.  I appreciated that service.  Many people may not know that this is a service that is available to them, but it is.    When I am ready, I will sign up to be a dog walker and volunteer at the center with the dogs.  I have not reached a point where I don't get very sad when I think about my dog or am around other people's dogs.  But when I do, I can't wait to spend the time with the dogs there.  This is an amazing facility with so many dogs and animals that need homes and need to be loved.  Even if you can't give a home, you can give a buck or you can give an hour --- an animal will love you for it.

I loved this place so much that I started writing the review at the restaurant before I left!  The food here is delicious.  I tried 2 entrees.  Why not order lunch for tomorrow.  Haha.  I had a fish dish and my all time favorite, bandeja paisa, actually a Columbian dish.  Both were delicious.  My dish was Everything I remembered about Bandeja Paisa.  Beans seasoned to perfection.  Steak marinated just right.  Even the plain white rice rated better than any plain white rice I've had.  It was cooked just salty enough and just fluffy enough.  Perfect!  Don't come here expecting the traditional restaurant. This place is small.  I counted... There were exactly 6 tables that seat 4 people.  That's 24 seats!    don't go there if you are in a rush!  The food is cooked to order.  Home cooked food takes time.  The gentleman, Carlos, that waited on me seemed like he took his time because they understand it takes time to make good food.  I even found that the folks in the restaurant were extremely friendly.  There was a regular customer there that day that kept me entertained the entire time I was there.    Keep in mind, this is a small establishment and it is not fast food, just amazing food.

Who's not a fan of Bebe?  I know for sure that I am.  I shop at this location several times a year.  In fact, the dress(blue) I'm wearing in my profile picture is a dress that I picked up from this Bebe store.  What I like most about shopping here is that I can always find something kinda trendy, kinda sexy and hot in this store.  I've always found that the sales associates were on point with suggesting a dress that suits my curves.   When I think, "uhm no, I dont' think I need a smaller size in that."  They say, "yeah, you do".  And they've been right.  When I think, "uhm no, that color is not right for me," they've been correct and on the money.  All of the sales people that I've worked with in that store have been RIGHT on the money when it comes to suggesting the size, colors and accessories to me.  The only person complaining about my affection for this Bebe location benefits from it.  My only issue with that store is, I love Bebe shoes.  I order them online quite often.  This store rarely has a shoe I'd like to at least check out in person at the store.  I suppose their money maker is the clothes, and they just don't carry all the current stock of shoes.  Trust me, if you're looking for a date night outfit or just a trendy outfit to wear to the gym, the ladies in this store will help.

*HH in RBar daily from 3-6p is worth going at least once in a visit.  *Live music on the Lobby patio from 6-10p daily.    Where do I begin?   I'm not even sure....  Ok.   Yes,  let's start with everything.   I liked everything about this resort.   Some things I loved.   But I like everything about this place.     I'm local and I love a staycation.   I've visited Camelback Inn to dine at BLT and to have spa treatments.   But I had not stayed until recently.   This place embodies desert beauty.   The grounds are beautiful and I loved waking up and walking out on my patio and watch the bunnies hop along.  I love the  fact that no building in the area is talker than a couple stories.   Every room has beautiful views of the mountains, even from the 1st floor Casitas.     The standard Casitas are very spacious.   There are generally no more than 4 Casitas per structure.   Someone complained that the kitchenette is tucked in a small space on the side of the room.   I personally loved that!   My guest for the weekend didn't even notice the kitchenette until the moments before we checked out.   My guest walked past that space (nice size fridge,  counter space,  microwave,  sink) all weekend and didn't notice it.   We thought that was funny.  The bathrooms have dual sinks and one is in the dressing room.   Loved it!   The Jackrabbit pool area is nice and fun for kids with a splash pad.   The pool is 3.5' deep at its deepest.   No zero depth entry though (thinking of really small kids).   There is a splash pad.  BTW : the pools are chilled in the summer and heated in the winter.   The day spa and amenities are nice.   I wrote a review of this business on Yelp too.   The best part of my experience was certainly the staff.   5 star service from the moment I walked in the door!   Unbelievably great service.  I can't say enough how they made my "Zen-ful staycation" one of my best resort stays ever.   I don't see this as a kid friendly resort though and there were not a ton of kids running around either.   I hate to say that about this resort.   The entertainment is very adult.   The vast majority of guests were adults.   The best amenities are for adults (spa,  bar,  blt).   I would say kid-friendly,  yes.   Kid-recommended,  not by me.   Return Factor:100%.   Next starvation will be Desert Ridge,  but I'll be back!......... (If you made it this far In  the review,  I am going to leave the auto-correction there,  I cracked up when I saw it after I posted the review. Autocorrection strikes again!)

April 2014 International Supper Club UYE (#ISCUYE) met here for dinner.  This was the anniversary of Monica O and I organizing the Yelp PHX International Supper Club and I'm so happy that we come here.     AFter a couple  of minutes, we were greeted at the front door and seated at an upstairs table - conveniently located next to the bar.  Kudos to the Persian Room for being THE restaurant with the BEST and most ATTENTIVE service in the 13 months that our group has been meeting.  We usually have from about 15- 30 people to attend.  IN this case, we were some place in the middle.  A large group that was waited on by 3 very attentive people.  I liked this - A LOT.  3 people helped to make things go more smoothly and efficiently. I can't say enough about how happy I was with the quality of their service.  In addition to our large party, there was another large birthday party in the downstairs dining room that was being seated at the time that we were being seated.  This is an awesome place for a large party.  Their happy hour lasts until about 7 or 7:30(Insanely late), so I am pretty sure that most of us ordered more than expected because all of their appetizers are half price during the happy hour.  I ordered a very delicious Chicken eggplant borani as my appetizer and shared it with the table.  Several others ordered appetizers and shared too.  My favorite was the Yogurt and Garlic Dip.  YIKES.  That stuff was great.  Becca H ordered that and she was sitting right beside me.  I felt like a little kid sneaking someone's food.  I just kept dipping in her Yogurt/Garlic Dip.  (LOL - TWSS).  I ordered a small side salad for my main course since the Chicken Eggplant Borani was enough to feed an army.  The side salad was just fine.    This also happened to be 2nd least expensive #ISCUYE!  I was happy with that.  My return factor for this place is 90%.

Stopped in here to have my brakes changed.  I was very happy with the service from the initial phone call to check the price of the service to picking up my car at the end.  I called in and said I think I need to get my brake pads changed, they told me, we'll do a full inspection and let you know if you really need them changed.  Cool.  This worked out, I did need them changed.    They changed my brake pads and explained to me how my rotors were wearing.  Showed me how they measure the thickness of the rotors and how they rotors get smoothed out.  I was impressed with the extremely careful attention to the detail of a curious person interested in the services rendered.  I would, 100%, go back here for an additional service.  If I get the same level of service on a return visit, I'm bumping this shop up to 5 stars.

I will never return to this Jiffy Lube.  My experience here was unpleasant.  I won't recount the whole story of my experience moment by moment, but what I will say about this place is that I left there feeling as though I'd been bamboozled and that they'd try to take advantage of me.   I will say that I felt as if they were trying to sell me ANYthing and everything.  Their gimmick?  They pull out your air filter and show you how dirty it is and try to sell you a new air filter.  they try to sell you all kinds of services.  Despite my stating - I DO NOT WANT ANYTHING ABOVE A STANDARD OIL CHANGE.  Every time I was asked would I like this or that, I repeated that statement.  After the oil change was complete,  I was told my oil change would be $74 dollars.  $74 dollars for a standard oil change?  really?  I spoke with the manger, i wanted them to put my old filter back in and put my old oil back in my car.  I wasn't going to pay for that.  They tried to slip in a charge for some kinda super duper oil despite my repeated requests for nothing extra and just the standard oil change.  The manager did reduce the price back to whatever teh standard oil change cost would be.  I will NEVER go back here.  I quite possibly will NEVER go to another Jiffy Lube.  I can't stand the way they try to push any and everything on you.

Even though the name says, "Senior Center", this is a multi-purpose facility with a tremendous amount of amenities for everyone of all ages.  Some of the amenities include, baseball field, basket ball court, playground, swimming pool, and a workout gym.   You will find that this facility is great for meetings because it has a couple classrooms with tables, chairs and white boards.  I would assume there are over head projectors and screens.  There is a large multi-purpose room in the back that has a foyer that could be used for a large meeting that required a setup just outside of the room, ie registration or packet pick-up.  There are a variety of activity rooms.  There is also a youth activity room with hang out area, pool, cubbies and TV.    The welcome desk is staffed and on a Saturday, there was more than one person working the desk.    Really, there's nothing senior about this multi-generational facility.  People of all ages can find something to do here.

I just read my first review of this business.... and I quote "I would go back for a group lunch or something, but the suggestion would not come from me."  Oh what a tangled web we weave....   I did go back in a group lunch (twice since) and guess what - You guessed it, the suggestion DID in fact come from me.  And boy was I ever so happy that I did.  I'm bumping Lalibela Cafe UP a notch because the food was incredibly good.  Recently, I went here with a group of folks who like to "tour the world one spoonful at a time".  I chose Lalibela because I wanted to choose a restaurant centrally located from the continent of Africa and because the Yelp reviews down lie!  You don't get 4 stars here for nothing!  Definitely worth a 3rd trip for me.  The group was seated promptly.  Everyone at the table enjoyed their food... how do I know?  Because every plate was cleaned!  I mean cleaner than clean!  When we ran out of injera to clean the plates, more was ordered!    If you plan to go there for lunch, there are 3 different types of lunch specials.  I would recommend the #2 lunch special in which you can choose different wats (like an Indian curry or a stew) to eat with your injera (crepe like pancake) - Here's a breakdown of what I ordered in my last visit, I had the Doro Wat (Spicy Chicken) and they Key Sega Wat (spicy beef) and a lentil based wat with injera.  I would have eaten it all, but I couldn't.  I had to be rolled out of that place my tummy was so full.    The fact of the matter is, and clearly, my last 2 experiences here have been fantastic with the latest one being even better.  Try them, you will like it.   Parking can be very tricky at lunch time.  You may want to get in the area before noon.  I've never been for dinner.

This is one of those places you stumble upon when you're looking for a costume for a party thrown by the greatest website that ever existed.  (no shameful plugs here).  I went into this store to rent a costume for a western themed party and what a treat it was.  This small store is tucked away in a very unassuming small shopping plaza on the southeast corner of University and McKinley (A block east of Hardy).   You have probably driven by this plaza 100 Million billion times and never noticed it, but once you've been there, each time you pass by, you look over there and think, "Oh, there's that little shop of horrors right over there."    Yep, little shop of horrors!  Why you ask?  This store kinda reminds me of a horror film.  First I walk in and there are pictures hanging on the walls of this very narrow front room.  Shoes and hats galore are on display making the space seem even more narrow.  I walk toward the back slowly as no one is in the front room and I call out, "is anyone here?"  I kid you not, I thought I'd walked in on the set of Friday the 13th.  Very spooky and creepy in there, but isn't that JUST the right place to buy or rent a costume!    I met the owner.  What a nice man.  He showed me his catalog of costumes.  He showed me his many pics, a great deal of the pics of costumes were of him in them!  I looked through the cow girl costumes and thought the selection was great.  There was at least costume that I had an interest in.  I was informed that the rental was around $50 and the deposit was $50.  I did not rent one of their costumes because I decided to go with my own costume at home, but I will go there when I have a need for other costumes that I don't keep readily in my closet, ie for the Renaissance Festival!!!    This place was fantastic.  I highly recommend it.  Check them out.

I came to this restaurant thinking... Hmm... this is the place that doesn't have as much traffic coming and going as the neighboring Mediterranean restaurant that I enjoyed so much..... Something must be wrong with THIS place.  But, because I organize a monthly "World Tour Lunch" group, I wanted to go to this particular restaurant because it is an Iranian restaurant...    Not a surprise,  it seems like each one of us ordered some form of a kabob/combination plate.  I also ordered the veggie soup, Aash, and the Baklava.  I was so surprised to find that the food in this restaurant tasted so good.  I enjoyed every bite of the tender and succulent chicken and the lamb.  And of course, the objective of most of us who are doing the tour is to also try each other's food, and I enjoyed the samplings of other folks food too.  So, I've come to this conclusion, this place has to be the best kept secret in Tempe!  I can't see how people will walk pass Tasty Kabob and go to the neighboring establishment  when this food is awesomely fantastic and prepared by a talented kitchen.  In addition to the the food, I was so very happy with the service!  Any place that willingly accommodates my strange requests for lettuce in place of rice/pasta in their dishes is generally okay with me.

What a sweet little find!    This small restaurant is located steps away from a very popular crepe restaurant.   Not to be dwarfed by that place,  P Croissant is big on taste,  service and options.   I went here on a Saturday,  pulled right up to the coffee bar and ordered a tasty cup of coffee.   The coffee ran out as I was pouring so the staff quickly filled the carafes.   Tasty coffee,  but that is not what makes this place special!   Tons and tons of freshly baked croissants.   Think of this as the Bagel shop of croissants.   So many different types of croissants,  from sweet to savory to spicy.   Then there are the sandwich options that are available.   I enjoyed a wonderful Croissant breakfast sandwich with veggies,  cheese and eggs.  I had taken a few bites and realized I didn't have the veggies.   I just asked them to brim then on the side,  but they insisted on making it over and making it right.   Awesome!     Great treat.

Lux lives up to its hipster hype.  Go here for the hip, bohemian feel you crave from Soho, Central Phoenix, or similar places.    I prefer getting my things to go because this place is always crowded and parking is a nightmare.  This is why I dock them 1star.  However, Lux is conveniently located just off the lite rail.  I am not sure how many times I have stopped in Lux over the past few weeks for a cup of coffee and a breakfast sandwich.  This Friday was the first time I noticed the bottle of Tito's and next to it a bottle of Hendrick's.....  This place has a bar?  Oh, gosh, they do!  Well damn!  Oh, I never envisioned myself as a hipster hanging out there eating at the the huge tables with my laptop on their free wifi or in one of the comfy chairs reading a book, but I see a book, comfy chair and cocktail in my future!  Stumble home....  Repeat.  Lol... Stumble home from the coffee shop.  Funny.  I highly recommend this place.    Return factor 100%.

My favorite place for pizza in Phoenix!     I absolutely love going to Cibo for many reasons.  What is there not to love about this place.  Cibo is a restaurant set inside of an early 20th century bungalow with beautiful hardwood floors and exposed brick. When you walk through the main doors, you are greeted by the hostess stand and a small quaint bar... there are several dining "areas" throughout the restaurant, as this was a "house" that has been renovated in the historic Filmore area just off the main downtown area of Phoenix.    The pizza here is fantastic.  People often compare this pizza to another popular pizza restaurant in Phoenix.  I don't think that there is a comparison.  Cibo is so much better.  I have tried several pizzas here, but my favorite, surprisingly, is the Genova.  I always order the pizza well done and the crust comes out nice and crisp.  I love the Pear Salad as well.  The salad is huge and can be share between 2 friends.  You must also try the lemoncello.  It is divine and the best in Phoenix that I've tried other than homemade.    Bon Appetite!

I'm sure I can't add anything that has not been said about this place already.  But given the fact that I love Yelping, I gotta at least try!    Walking into this establishment, you get the sense that you have walked into a hipster dining experience with the very unique light fixture hanging over the lounge area of the restaurant.  The bar with its clean lines is a somewhat bright and warm modern space that is separated from the main dining room by frosted glass and metal room dividers to the right of the entry way.  You walk in and the hostess stand is  a few steps inside of the door.  That's a good deal because I'm sure there is a line out the door most nights.   I stopped in here solo one day after the lunch rush.  Yea for me.  I like it when restaurants are quiet at that time of the day.  I had my pick of tables and I chose a table right by the window overlooking the wonderfully appointed and comfortable looking patio.  I asked my server to give me the most popular burger and the spiciest fries.  I had not planned to drink, but she threw out a cockatail (Pom Press) that sound great and I went for that too.  The server told me the Fez burger was the most popular burger and I said, "I'll try it."  She asked me if I wanted to read the ingredients, I said, "I can read them, but I don't care what's on it, I want to try it."  WOW I'm so happy I went with the server.  That was ONE HELLUVA good burger.  You could taste how well the Molasses BBQ sauce and the cilantro go together.  The sweet of the pears and the crisp of the fried onion straws contributed well to the taste of the burger as a whole.  I don't eat much bread, but I had a few bites of the bread.  Next time, I'm getting that burger w/o the bread.  yes, there will be a next time... and another one and another.  I would give them a 5 star review, but I wondered if the burger patty itself is pressed just before it is cooked.  Is it fresh or frozen.  I'm sorry to say, but I wasn't sure.  I meant to as my server, but forgot.  The food coma knocked me out for the count.

Mmmmmm.. Mmmmmm. Mmmm... oh wait, i should say more than that I suppose.  Ok, I go to this bakery for one reason and one reason only - RVC.    Ahhh, what is RVC you ask?  haha, you're clearly not a cake conniosseur (neither am I).  BUT my dear, I know DAMN good Red Velvet Cake when I taste it.  I'm orginally from the region that spawned this decadent moist cake.  I know women who make these cakes from scratch that would make you slap 10,00 Mommas.    Once I moved to Phoenix, I started on a quest to find a place where I can get moist decadent RVC.  I've been to just about every notable bakery East of Central.  it took me a little over a year to discover Tammie Coe Cakes at La Grande Orange.  Then I realized the bakery itself was closer to my home and now I go to the shop itself.  Hands-down, if you are a RVC fanatic like myself, then you will find that this shop has the best, most authentic RVC prepared in a commercial establishment in Phoenix.    this shop is so conveniently located right off of 7th Street, just after the I10 Exit.  You can't miss it.  You don't want to miss it.  Trust me.

*restaurant/Bar only*  So, Gallo Blanco, the popular restaurant that opened a few years ago and was debuted in the cover of Phoenix magazine during their 25 Best new restaurants, stopped operating in the Clarendon Hotel.  However, a modern Mexican restaurant does operate in its place and is doing a very fine job.  I have stopped in here for drinks and come for a couple meals since GB closed.  My favorite thing on that menu has to be the other-worldly delicious flapjacks!  Oh my word.  Those things taste better than any pancake I have ever had in my life.    I had a few custom crafted cocktails and the bartenders did a pretty good job with my list of favorite ingredients.  The roof top is a nice place to hang out and have a cocktail.    The pool area is adorable and the last time I was there at 11pm, folks were still hanging out there.  If you like the boutique hotels of south beach... You will enjoy this one too.  Return Factor:95%

I can't believe I've never written a review of this place.   I think they have delicious food.  I wish their calamari were better.  But the other items I've had on the menu are tasty.  I had no idea they had a formal dining room or a private dining room.  I've ALWAYS only gone to the Lounge.  The atmosphere in the lounge is usually energetic and fun.  THere is an outside patio if you like sitting outside.  I have gone here on weekend nights to hear live soul music and to dance.  The crowd is a 30+ crowd and I personally love that, since I am 30+.  :-)  I have been for HH and for the later hours for the band.  I think they have great HH offerings from the appetizer menu and for the drink menu.   The service here has ALWAYS been top flight and top class.  I've never been disappointed with the quality of service here.  My only complaint about this establishment is that it is in Ahwatukee and not in a more central location.

In a single word, Awesomeness....  For a restaurant that is part of a chain of restaurants, there's really nothing that can compare to Mastros.  There's nothing chain about the experience or the ambiance of Ocean Club.    My last visit here was on a night in the middle of the week.  That didn't stop what seemed to be the rest of Scottsdale from coming here for a great evening of food and libations.  When you walk into Ocean Club, there is an ambiance that simply states sophistication and upscale.    I was fortunate to be on the arm of a dashing and handsome gent as we were joined by another couple.  We were seated promptly for our reservation at a fantastic table that had a great view across the dining room.  The service was impeccable.  We ordered drinks and a bottle of wine suggested by our server.  We ordered a couple of appetizers and we were set for while as we looked over the menu and carried on conversation with our friends.    My friend and I are pretty easy to please at restaurants like this.  Dare I say, we're pretty predictable.... for me almost always I order sea bass if it is on the menu and my friend 100% orders bone-in filet.  We were in luck, they had both on the menu as a great and amazing establishment like this should.  Their sea bass was as buttery and delicious as it was the first time I had it and all the other times thereafter.  So, the sides are where we usually get somewhat creative.  I suggest the lobster mashed potatoes, so very yummy and succulent and filling.  Not something I would order, but I definitely enjoy when someone else has ordered it at the table!  The garlic mashed potatoes are also tasty.  My friend loves the creamed corn.  My personal favorite is the sauteed spinach.    For dessert, my friend loves Mastro's butter cake and we never go there without having it.  Again, very tasty and delicious.  This is a place to bring your mom for her birthday or parent's wedding anniversary, a woman that you are with that you care for or just care to get with.  This place is fantastic.  It is truly as good as it gets.  I'm also a HUGE fan of Mastro's Steakhouse.  I'm totally biased, this is the best restaurant chain on the planet.  Period.

This place is everything that all the other reviews have said before me.  The food here is quite simply - awesome.  I've been a few times.  I've ordered the Cajun Pasty and the Pesto Pasty.  Both are very good options if you like chicken.  I usually eat half and save the other half for the next day.  It's still good heated up the next day.  What I like the most about this place is the food comes out remarkably quick.  I've gone for lunch on various occasions, arriving around 11:45 each time.  I've gone with one person or with 4 or 5 other people and the food always came out in a reasonable amount of time - even with the restaurant packed to the hilt with hungry folks.  I give them an A+ for their speed given their popularity.  This establishment is fairly odd in a quirky way that makes you want to return.  The decor has "character".  I suppose the intention is to replicate a English Pub.  I'm not sure.  They expanded the dinging room in recent years and the new dining room is full of these very long tables where the seating looks like what used to be a church bench.  A little awkward whilst you try to chump down on your pasty.  Nonetheless and church bench aside, however you have to sit, its definitely worth your time to visit this establishment.

Cool place.  Tons of shops, art and  entertainment.   You get everything you are desiring in a very small area.  I love old town for that reason.  It's where "hip" young adults want to go when they are done with the Tempe style night life.  This is where young adults with a lot of snootiness go.  And then, there are the commoners like myself who go here for a good meal from time to time and the occasional night of dancing and excitement that makes up a night on the town in Old Town!    My favorite Old town spots are FNB http://www.yelp.com/biz/fnb-scottsdale#hrid:4rcXAsUdD2iha-eMQBv0yA, Citizen's Public House http://www.yelp.com/biz/citizen-public-house-scottsdale#hrid:_owXWzQUkjY1KnIL8sG6VA and  Pig and Pickle(is this really old town?) http://www.yelp.com/biz/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale#query:Pig%20and%20Pickle to name a few.  These are places I go for the late night (or any time) vah-vah-vah-vooooooom shake it down swizzle-me .... TIMBER ------at the end of a night of dancing and walking around in ridiculous 5 inch heels with the tightest dress known to mankind.  Yes, old town is a place for fun for all ages, but I'll be honest, I'm not there for the art walk http://www.yelp.com/biz/scottsdale-art-walk-scottsdale, I'm not there for the fabulous Mall http://www.yelp.com/biz/scottsdale-fashion-square-scottsdale-2#query:Fashion%20square ---- OK ok, you got me on that one, I go there for the mall.  but I'm not there for the Ollie Trolly http://www.yelp.com/biz/dunn-transportation-ollie-the-trolley-tempe#query:trolly.... Honestly, I'm there for the drinks, the food, the beautiful people and the vah-voooooooom baby.    Go there.. have fun...Yelp about it, like me.  Have fun!  See art!  Go drinking!  Also, don't forget to Thank the almighty for your DD.    Yea!

What an awesome park.  This park has everything except a bunch of pavilions and picnic tables.  I don't think that it is a good park for having a BBQ or a church picnic.  but could be ok for a small kids party.  There is a pool, a splash pad, a senior/community center, a skate park and 2 separate play areas for kids under 5 and kids over 5.    I love the fact that play ground area has the nice seats all around for the parents to sit very close by and watch their kids.  The play ground area has a huge sand box, so bring your "beach gear" and play on the splash pad and then go to the sand box area and dig for seashells or whatever you dig up.  There is ample parking all around the park.  Follow 48th Street all the way south until it dead-ends into this park.

I'm surprised that there aren't more reviews about AZ wine company.  I had the special occasion to stop in here prior to having dinner next door at Atlas Bistro.    I found that their staff was extremely helpful on more than one occasion in which I wanted to select a bottle of wine.  I appreciate the wide selections of wine and the knowledgeable staff, buy what appealed to me the most was the fact that they have several bottles of wine that are highly rated for under $30.  I was a little surprised by that actually.  Of course there are wines in there for new and mid-level collectors.  I'm not sure if this is the place for serious wine collectors.    One thing is for sure, I have used AZ wine many times when I wanted to stop in and pick up a quick bottle of wine.  I took 3 bottles of wine to the International Supper Club UYE and everyone that had wine said they really enjoyed it.  I have NEVER been disappointed with the recommendations.  I highly suggest this store for the wine lovers who love local businesses!

I've been here  a couple of times in the past.  Usually at someone else's suggestion.  I can't say that I recommend this place, UNLESS you like your lunch served up with a lot of attitude.  The lady that takes the orders at the counter is usually abrasive and rude.  I am the type of person who will kill the meanest person with kindness, but there are places where I draw the line.  So, I have drawn the line with Rome's Pizza.    The funny part about it all is that my line is often zig-zag and curvy, so i still go here when someone else wants to go.  hehe.  My friends like the abuse I guess.  One friend says the lady is nice to him.   The plus side of going here is the fact that they serve an average pizza by the slice with your custom toppings.  They also make hoagies and some other Italian-like dishes.  they have a nice lunch special that includes soda for a few bucks.   They also serve some typical American favorites like hot wings.   I usually order the 2slices of pizza lunch special and get the unsweetened tea.  I'm not sure why I forget, but their tea tastes horrible because the water from the fountain tastes terrible!  But it never fails, I forget that I need to BMOB of water with me.    All in all, this place is a dive.   Give it a try.

I've been using SUPER Shuttle for many years to be transported back and forth to the airport in various cities.    The vans are always clean.  Always on time.  The prices are decent.    I am giving them a solid 5 stars for a seamless process for catching a shuttle.  I went on the website, paid for a round-trip ticket a few days in advance.  The day before my trip, a reminder text and email were sent to me confirming the 15 minute window pick up time.  The next day, about 30 mins or so before my pick up time, SS sent a text confirming the driver was coming for me with a link to view the driver's progress on a map.  I could see how far/long before the driver arrived.  I went outside when I saw the driver turn on my street.  I am then whisked away to the airport.  The return is exactly the same.  About an hr before landing, I got a text message (I was using the plane's WiFi) asking me to check-in once I had my luggage.  The check-in link told me exactly where to go to wait for the shuttle.  The check-in page told me the identifying number of my shuttle and provided that map so I can see the shuttle approaching.   5 mins after I walked to the shuttle pick up location, my ride appeared.    Seamless.  Everytime I thought I needed to look up how to do something, Super Shuttle read my mind, apparently, and sent a text and email that answered the question.  Bravo.  This is amazingly good service.

Like other Yelpers, I found out about this hole-in-the-wall via another Yelper.  I have had it bookmarked for a while!  I haven't gone before today because they only accepted cash!  You guessed it, they accept plastic now.  Whoop.  Awesome.    I tried the beef tongue, carne asada and chicken tacos.  I thought the tacos were amazing.  I am definitely a food venturing American and I am ashamed to admit that I just love the insides of tacos, but I usually leave the shells.  Either I was super hungry today, or those shells were amazing because, I ate all 3 shells too.    While the tacos were great, the salsas and pickled veggies were amazing to me.  They have a salsa bar stocked with whole roasted jalapeños, pickled veggies, and regular, chipotle and green salsa.  The salsa was so yummy that I am pretty sure I ate enough of the regular salsa to have been charged for a bowl of salsa soup.  Just fantastic to me.  One nice thing, this retaurant has expanded and can accommodate small groups for lunch or dinner.    The parking lot is small.  I saw strange things happening at the businesses mext door and I saw some kids walk in large bowls of what looked like was food for someone, I just hoped it wasnt for serving in the restaurant.  Alas....  My return factor for this place is 100% and it could very well be tomorrow!

By far one of the top 3 salons I've ever been a client.  What I love about this salon is the warmth of the stylists and how welcoming they are.  Any salon can make you look beautiful, but it takes a unique combination of attention and care to not only make you look beautiful and also make you feel beautiful!  When I leave Arlette's salon, I FEEL beautiful on the inside and out.  Arlette and Deshonna are genuinely concerned with the health and beauty of natural hair.  I was so lucky to find Arlette because when I started going to her to care for my hair, I was learning how to care for my "new" natural hair.  Arlette was so patient and willing to teach me how to care for my hair!  2 years later, I'm still Embracing My Natural Curl!  I have never waited longer than 10 minutes for my appointment to start.  As far as I'm concerned, that's an on time appointment - all the time!  She is extremely flexible with appointment times.  You can call and book apps, or text, or use her scheduler on her website or her Facebook page!  I love that convenience!  There is free wifi in the salon.  What I love about Arlette is that I have never experienced her acting catty or saying negative things about other people.  That's major because there are only a couple of other salons that I can say this about.   This is a part of creating an atmosphere conducive to an all around feel good and positive experience.  I don't get extensions, but both stylists do provide that service and I've never seen an unhappy client!    Arlette's and Deshonna are awesome stylists and even greater women.

Still on time and still doing hair well.    Arlette is skilled at what she does.  She is very attentive and she does a great job at giving you personal service that is on time,  all the time.     I call Arlette a "Hair Artist"  because,  quit Frankly, that is precisely what she is.   She provides amazing styles.     Arlette can provide you excellent care of your natural hair.  I have learned alot from Arlette with respect to taking care of my natural hair.   I was embracing my natural curl long before I met her,  but she helped me learn how to jazz that curl up.     I docked a star because I didn't like the fact that I couldn't  schedule an appointment with a different stylist,  who was available at the time I could come,  when  Arlette wasn't available to do my hair.  I was desperate to get my hair done for an event that night and I was baffled by the fact that I was basically being told to go to a different salon,  instead of using the other available stylist in This salon.  I had gone to the other stylist in the past when Arlette wasn't available.   I am a grown woman being told I can't spend my money the way I wanted and with whom I wanted.   That has never set well with me.

A day full of errands is not one of my favorite ways to spend the day.  But every now and again, you gotta do what you have to do and when I need to ship a package whilst I'm on that side of town, most certainly, I'd like to stop at this UPS store to do it.    On this occasion, I was returning an online purchase.  I searched on my Yelp App to map out my stops and this UPS store turned up.  This is a typical UPS store with packaging materials for purchase and mailboxes to rent.  I was particularly happy with the service that I received from the lady who waited on me.  I arrived to the store about 3 or 4 minutes before they opened.  She saw me outside and opened the door.  I appreciated her not making me wait the 3 or 4 minutes and she let me come into the store.  She was helpful in that she reminded me that I needed to keep up with my receipt because there was no other way to prove that I dropped off the package.  Great tip for me as that receipt would have gone in receipt purgatory, my purse pocket.  A clean and well organized store.

Who doesn't like a little play house for kids!  THis theater is simply adorable.  Just ripe for fund for children of all ages to sit and watch young budding actors and actresses cut their chops on the stage.  I recommend arrive a little early in order to park close to the theater.  There is a parking lot behind the theater and 2 across the street.  There is pay parking along the streets in the area.   There is a very limited snack bar with water and snacks that seem to along with the play of the day.  This is a great place for a summer playdate!  Have fun!  Return factor 100%

I'm happy with the professional service that is provided here.  I will have a 6-8 month relationship with this office as I have procedures done in stages.  I will complete my review at the end.  So far they rank a 4 star in my book after 3 visits to the office.  To make things short for you, I am ranking them a 4 at this point in time for 2 solid reason: #1 Most dentist-type offices are more modern and #2 they don't send out reminder texts or emails!  Most Dentist-type offices do that.  I LOVE the modern services that Dentist offices provide.  My work with this office is mostly cosmetic.  I want to be afforded the luxuries of texts and wi-fi when I'm spending 1000's of dollars on cosmetic stuff!  (note, this is only phase 1 of my process with them) I REALLY appreciate how thorough their office is in the  consultation phase of the process.  This is how things will happen for you if you decide to visit Chad Cravatta's office.    you make an appointment for a consultation.  You bring in your insurance information and whatever information that you are bringing from your dentist that referred you to the office.  They will take some x-rays of  your teeth so that the doctor can evaluate your treatment plan.  for me, he looked at 3-d images and then explained how the treatment would occur.  Once the consultation is complete, they submit a request to your insurance to verify that the insurance will cover/approve the work and they make a follow-up apt with you to go over the costs and the procedure as well as pre-operative and post-operative care!     I consulted with another Periodontist near by, but I chose Cravatta because I felt more comfortable with him and I felt like his explanation of how the procedure would go included his contingency plan along with various other things that could possible need to be done.  he thoroughly explained everything and answered all questions.    I had my first procedure done 3 or 4 weeks go. I'm doing just fine.  I'll follow-up in a few month when I return for the subsequent work and update my final disposition of this office/doctor.

If you like comics, this is the place for you.  Tons of magazines to choose from and so much more.  I stopped in here with comic-enthusiasts.  I am a novice, but it was fun learning about the history of some of my favorite comic strip characters.  The store is fairly large and there are a ton of things to select from.  I think you will find it to be a very interesting place.

This is a favorite "staycation" hotel for me.  I stayed here on my 3rd trip to Phoenix, just prior to moving into my home.  I loved it then and I love it now.  Every since I moved here, I've spent at least one night a year at this resort.  Here's why...  I stayed at this resort once when I was ill and had work being done at my home.  I called ahead and said I would be staying and I was "sick" and basically immobile and I would be alone most of the time.  The staff there was so helpful to me.  I didn't even realize that asking a hotel to borrow a wheel chair was an option, but this hotel offered a wheel chair to me to use during my weekend stay!  ha!  how wonderful because then, I was mobile!  I could wheel to Jurlique, the dayspa!  I could wheel myself to the Taggia!  And most importantly, with this being late May, I could wheel myself to the pool and lay out by the pool.  The staff that I saw along the way offered to help me.  I'm not sure if they all knew my health situation, but I know one things for sure, they were all so incredible helpful to me during that weekend.  I fell in love with this resort on my first stay, but I really fell for them after my stay whilst I was sick.  A few words about the resort itself.  I would give them a 3.5 - 4 on the quality of the rooms.  4 Star for the lovely patios that each room has.  4.5 Stars for its location.  5 Stars for the pool area.  5 Stars for the daily wine tastings - I like to chat and meet people.  5 + Stars for the quality of service I received EACH time I've stayed there!  I continue to visit the day spa and stay a night here or there.  I drop in from time to time to have a drink as well.  I've always been happy with this resort.  I would recommend it to anyone: folks with kids, romantics, retirees and adventurers.

CASH ONLY  Well, let's hear it for the "$3 Movie Theater".  Yaaaaaay!!!   I LOVE this place!  I don't care that it is an old theater.  I love the creepy memorabilia that fills the lobby and the very retro arcade games.  I love the fact that the movie theater is so old, it only has a center isle down the middle of each auditorium.  I love it that the folks sitting in front of me are squarely in my view of the screen and I have to either move or look around their big heads.  Even that extremely odd, but not out of place, mechanical band in the front lobby that plays music you never hear.  I love it that people take pictures with the statues in the lobby!  Such a strange place and such a wonderful bargain.  I particularly LOVE their popcorn and the fact that their large popcorn is refillable!    What I love most about Pollack is the fact that I can see a movie that is not that old for just $3.  I wait a few weeks after the opening and I can pay $3 to see the movie instead of paying $9 for the matinee!  I take my chances and wait for a movie to come to Pollack before I run out to see it.   I recently went there with a young person.  We had a large popcorn and we both got in and I spent $3!!!  Coolest way to win points with the young people w/o breaking the bank!    I  bring my friends here too.  Everyone knows, I love popcorn.  Truth be told, I get a desire for movie popcorn and decide to go see a movie so I can eat popcorn.  I mean if you are what you eat, I would BE a popcorn kernel (DON"T tell my orthodontist that)  But my popcorn is mine, I don't share it and I'm pretty serious about it.  At Pollack, the prices are cheap enough, so just get your own.  :-P  CASH ONLY  (SN: this was my 100th review.  I had been saving that review for a special business and dang forgot about it.  well Pollack, at least you're 4 stars.  Happy 100th to me)

Never thought I would review a golf tournament or a golf hole, for that matter.  Oh, where to begin?  I know....  I attended the Phoenix Open a couple of weeks ago. My perspective is not that of a person who plays golf or even a spectator!  My perspective is that of a reveler.  I went to the open with no intentions of seeing a single ball hit or a golfer play.  Some guy named Phil Michelson was there, but what did I care.  (I know who Phil M is.  But what about that Tiger Woods guy?)   I had my cocktails, my prime seat and all the drunk revelers to watch.  Needless to say, I had fun despite it being rained out this year.  For the sheer size and volume of people, this event is well organized.  The event planner did a great job moving a few 100,000 people in and out of the course over the week long tournament.  Tips for the ladies: 1. Wear heels at your own risk. 2. Don't bring a big arse purse.  You can't take it in the tourney.  You will have to leave it in your car.  If you have a small clear purse, use that. 3. Wear sunblock 4. Look nice.  Dress comfortably cute.    5. Get a pass into somewhere.    My return factor: 100%

It is with a bit of sadness that I write this review.  But I am sure that it will be therapeutic in the end.  I took my little dog here for the past 5.5 years.  Most of the time, he went here for boarding and he loved it.  When he would arrive, he would jump from seat to seat in my car and the care takers in the kennel knew my dog and they all loved him very much.  My dog loved this place.    I liked the indoor/outdoor kennels for him because he liked to run around.  At the end of each visit, my baby boy would come home exhausted from all the jumping and excitement.  Depending on how long he stayed, sometimes, he would just rest for the first day back home.  He loved the excitement of barking at the other dogs and bouncing bouncing bouncing around.  My little guy was also cared for very well when he went here for boarding and I also allowed the doctors there to take care of his veterinary needs.  Once when I was out of town, they phoned me to tell me that the doctors had taken a look at him to make sure he was ok because he seemed to be having some problems.  I appreciated the call.  The doctor that I spoke to explained to me the symptoms to look for when we arrived home.  I did, but never saw them and he was healthy.  VERY healthy.  My dog, unfortunately, got out of our yard and was hit by a car.   I had to bring him here for the last time.  I called the office before bringing him down, as he was already dead and I just didn't know what to do.  Misty was so kind to me and helpful and comforting.  I was understandably upset by it all.  But she comforted me when I needed it and had the paperwork ready for me when I arrived.  I was given all of the information and options for handling my dogs remains.  I paid and I went on my way.    This office is great.  While some may complain about the prices, I know my dog loved it here.  I would recommend them over and over again.  I know Jack would.

Always a delicious, kinda healthy meal option. Very friendly to the vegan/vegetarian population.  I have enjoyed many different things at PJ.  My favorite has to be the falafel.  I enjoy adding their spicy chicken to salads.  Their pita bread is always light delicious and very fresh.  I'm truly a fan.  I to to the various Pita Jungles across the valley several times a year.

There is no a/c  waiting area. But they have free vacuums. Cheap decent wash.  Worth it. I recommend going early to beat the heat if you get full service.

The Farm Kitchen is a casual dining experience suitable for a date picnic, an outdoor baby shower, or an afternoon lunch with the family.  A favorite for sandwiches and some of the desserts.  They close for the hot summer months.  They are reopening on September 13. I will update with a check-in and a review of some of my favorite things.

I'm a huge fan of the Farm Kitchen on Maya's farm.   I frequent the farm businesses and I am a CSA member of the farm itself.  So, of course, I have very high marks for this farm in general.    The Farm Kitchen is a casual dining experience suitable for a date picnic or girlfriends lunch in an open air patio with quaint picnic baskets to boot.  For the novice visitor to Maya's Farm, there are 3 restaurants.  The Farm Kitchen is in the "Little house" at the right of the driveway on to the farm.  This season, they stopped allowing cars to park along the drive to the back of the farm where the 2 other restaurants (Quiessence and Morning Glory Cafe).  Now when you come to visit The Kitchen, you have to park in the parking lot on the east side of 32nd street and walk across.  once you enter into the Farm Kitchen, you are greeted with the aroma of some amazing baking or cooking.  It always smells so wonderful in there.  You will find some local food items in the store, even down to the locally made Poore Brother potatoe chips!  LOCAL LOCAL LOCAL.  Inside the Kitchen, you place your order from a menu that is loaded with your choice of sandwiches, salads, flavored teas, and soups.  They normally have an array of desserts to choose from as well.  I personally love the buttner squash creme brulee.  Once you place your order, you go outside and wait for your number to be called.  Once your food is ready, you can choose to sit on the patio or venture over to the picnic tables or spread your own blanket and eat your food under the pecan trees.  One thing of note;  you can schedule baby showers, et al with the kitchen.  My personal favorites on this menu are: Tuscan Chicken Sandwich Italian Sandwich Any of their broth based soups.   Butternut Squash Creme Brulee Chocolate Chip Cookies

Update:New Management = New way of life.  this Starbucks has made great improvements.  I don't go as much as I used to when I thought I had less time.  but I do go often enough to read or just pick up a coffee and I've seen a great improvement in this store.  That's great.  2011 Review I'm giving them a 3 because I rarely get exactly what I want from the window. But let me start with the good first.  Friendliest bunch of folks I've ever seen.  All people on the staff seem to love their jobs!  They also seem to work very efficiently.     Unfortunately, the attire is a little small.  Ites not conducive to a small study group, even though it practically sits on a small college campus..  No couches or comfy chairs to sit and socialize.  My main reason for the 3 rating is the fact that I rarely get what I "want" from that drive up window!  I used to order a tall coffee and a HOT veggie sandwich.  The sandwich is almost always cold in the center, even if I ask them to heat it longer so the center is warm.  Sometimes I ask for my coffee with two pumps of cream and I have to go in to get more cream.  I have stopped ordering the sandwiches as much, saves me money, that's for sure.    I started making my own coffee at home, and soon, I'll probably just stop by there as a treat once a week for the coffee, sans the sandwhich.

I occasionally stop in this store while driving past.  I will try to keep my comments on the positive side.  NOTE if you don't read anything else: if you are shopping here, it is imperative that you check the expiration date for food items.    So, my comments here will primarily be about my experience with packaged food items in this store over the past 2 years. Generally, I don't buy a lot of packaged  food, but when I do, I go to Wal-mart because they generally have the cheapest prices.  But for a while, many of the items that I did buy were extremely close the expiration date or beyond it.   There is a certain brand of frozen biscuits I like to indulge myself in from time to time.  I've only seen them at Wal-Mart, of course.  So, I bought them at this store once.  I got them home and realized they had expired in 2008, it was early 2010.  Like I said, I may stop through here once a month in passing to do some shopping for packaged items - because I won't buy meat there at all.     I stopped through there a couple times recently and I have found that I only saw some yogurt that was expired in the cooler and salad dressing that was due to expire the next day.  None of the packaged items I bought were expired or extremely close to the expiration date - I usually check everything before I put it in my cart.  I find that the produce section of this store is sub-standard at best.  Can I see shallots, buttnut squash, artichokes or any locally grown veggies/fruits?  They carry typical fresh veg and fruit.  I applaud that , but much of it looks unsavory and old.  Again, in the recent 2 months, I've seen an improvement in this area as well, so I applaud that.      Will I stop shopping there on occasions?  No. I won't.  BUT, I have experienced far better.

What I like about F&E is the customer service.  I can't get enough of going into a grocery store to do my shopping and everyone in the store offers to help or greets you.  It is a refreshing change from the big box stores.  I love buying 1 or 2 ready made meals a week.  It is inevitable that I will need to use one that week.  F&E's ready-made meal selections are pretty extensive AND are very yummy.  I freeze them too, they keep just as well in the freezer for about a week.  Not sure if I'm breaking any rules by doing that, but whoopie it works for me!   I love love love their Greek yogurt.  I'm pretty sure that F&E yogurt is NOT healthy, can't be.  Nothing that tastes that darn good could be.  It takes 45+ minutes to cook brown rice, the fresh and easy ready-made brown rice is fantastically delicious AND takes 90 seconds to prepare.  I shop around and I also find that prices in F&E are often cheaper than they are at the big box stores, especially Fry's.    This store is always clean and is a great place to pick up your groceries.

What a wonderful experience for me.  I had planned all winter to visit this resto.  My friend and I kept trying to set a date that would work in Mar/Apr this year.  With it being the high season here in AZ, we had to book about 4 weeks in advance to get a decent seating time on a weekend night.  So, we booked our date.  A week out, my friend has a family situation that came up and could not make it.  Well, I waited all that time (not including the time it finally took for us to settle on a date) I sure as hell wasn't going to cancel the dinner JUST because my friend could not go.    Ok, so this is definitely not the type of place one would expect to see a woman sitting along eating dinner.  NO WAY.  This place has the most romantic, quiet and beautiful patio dining room.  With it being April, the patio dining room was in full effect and in walks ... ME.. solo.  Dressed to the nines in my 5 inch heels and dress and etc as if I were meeting someone.. Nope... table for 1.  I am seated right away and this is when I began to really sit back and enjoy myself.  Every person that came to my table called me by name, Ms D, can I get you some more Tea?  Ms D, how was the this and Ms D, can we get you a that?  Oh man, all that fuss over me made me feel like a true princess.  Chef Chris even came by twice and commented that he was happy I had decided to come anyway.  I was too.  My meal was very good.  A week or so before the dinner, Chef Chris personally called me to ask what types of foods we didn't like and what we liked.  I said Chilean sea bass is my favorite fish and I generally enjoy fish.  I forgot to mention that the only thing I really HATE is fennel and caraway seeds - like PLEASE DO NOT PUT THAT IN MY DISHES.  How I manged to forget that important detail is beyond me!    So its the dinner night....   On my drive to dinner, I remember thinking to myself, how could I forget that i HATE fennel and caraway seeds.  I thought, what are the chances that he would have fennel or caraway seeds in the dish?  I shrugged it off and thought, "naaaah".  Get to dinner and discover they had Chilean Seabass (Yeaaa!) with, you guessed it, blanched fennel and etc.  My heart sank because I don't really eat beef, which was the other option.  so, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass.  I figured I could possibly remove anything with fennel in it and just eat the fish.    To my surprise, the fish comes out and, you guessed it, I LOVED it.  Fennel and all.  I was shocked.  I ate EVERY bite of that fish.  Chef Chris told me that blanching fennel calms down the flavor and he was right.  It was actually extremely pleasant.    Any place that can make me like fennel and cause me to start cooking the fennel in my CSA basket at home deserves a minimum 4 stars.  They get a bonus star for the stellar service.  I think I will return for a b'day dinner... alone in the next couple of weeks.  I'm due for some food pampering.    Bravo Chef Chris and staff!

Great service.  Tasty food.  I like it for lunch because later, I can skip dinner.  Their salad bar satisfies the vegetarian taste buds.  I like this place alot.  I think it lives up to the hype.

This place is a right of passage for any foodie in Phoenix.  Until recent months, I frequented their Tuesday Ramen nights, but duty calls, and I can't go as often.  By far Posh's Ramen is the BEST in PHoenix.  There is no mistaking that.  If you like Ramen, don't be intimidated by the gourmet reputation that comes with POSH.  A standard bowl of Ramen is reasonably priced at ~$12.    4 nights a week, though, POSH is an improvisational food destination.  I've had 3 improvisational dinner services.  My last experience was absolutely fantastic.  I could not believe the food experience (notice I call it an experience) that I had.    Fortunately, most of the staff remembers me (I kind of stand out), so my experiences here are always pleasant and wonderful.  I love to sit at the counter of the open air kitchen and watch the chef and his staff at work.  I also make a reservation most of the time, even when it's not necessary.  I love this place.   Return Factor: 100%

There is a reason that on Friday nights the "seafood" buffet is only $14.50.  Pacific Coast seafood buffet is about the same price and is far better with way more options. I'd don't really have much in the way of positives to say about this place.  Wait, my server was pleasant and enjoyable.  Now, first off, I would never bring my child to this place to eat.  This has to be the smokiest establishment in metro Phx.  Even though the restaurant is nonsmoking, the casino's smoke proliferates into every available pocket of space!  At the end of your dinner, when you get to your car and open your purse to get your keys, smoke will billow from it.    Now, on to the food...  You walk into the establishment and pay for the buffet much like u would at any casino buffet.  You leave your tip at this point too. Not an issue for me, but what disgusted me was the cashier tried to short my server on the amount of the tip that I left!  I kept telling her she wrote the wrong amount on the slip and the cashier kept pretending to not understand me.  But I've waited on a few tables in the college days, so we got that fixed.  So the seating area is approaching Dive-ey.  But looked clean.  They have an "overflow" room that people can sit in if the main dining room is full.   The most disappointing part about RRB was the food.  I can deal with a shady cashier, dive-ey atmosphere, but bad food is not an option when I have driven 30 + mins to get to you!  The buffet bar is relatively small with salad options - green mix, romaine and Caesar.  There are the regular Salad bar staples.  They do have a lady who makes a great pepperchini and feta mix from scratch that taste great.  The hot bar has mashed potatoes and rice.  There is "prime riib" swimming in warm juice and over-cooking it.   There was stuffed cabbage that taste like u can imagine stuffed cabbage tasting like.  Oh, yeah, I'm forgetting something, the seafood... Crab legs and fried shrimp.    Suffice it to say, I will most likely will never return.

It really is a shame that I've never written a review about this place.   I've loved the coffee here for quite some time.  Personally, this is the best cup of coffee in Phoenix.  I don't get the 5 dollar coffee-bombs, I get the traditional old fashion regular coffee with half of it being decaf.  The baristas in this location are FAST, efficient and provide decent service.  I have to dock them 1-star because most of them do something that is highly annoying to me.  I hate being called "girl".  I'm probably old enough to be some of those kids mom!  I don't look it.  Riiiiiight?  Hahaha. Buy honestly.  Excessively calling me "girl" when u greet me doesn't go over well.  I mentioned it to one barista.  They are also a little bit more expensive than SB's.  That aside, the coffee is still very good and I go here every week.  TIP:  get out of your car in the fall/winter/spring and walk to the side window.  That is always much faster than sitting in my car.

This is a review that has been in the making for quite some time.  This review is for the THIS location.  This is a 3.5 Star review, but I can't give them a 3.  I will cut to the chase and save most of my comments for the Phoenix/Original location.  LoLo's is down right good chicken and great waffles.  This location seems to not be as busy as the flagship location in downtown.  But, please don't think that means that this location is not busy.  At lunch time, if you arrive before noon or after 1:30, you will stand your best chance to be seated right away.  On the weekends, fa'git about it, you'll wait.  its worth it.   I order the exact same thing Every time I go.  I rarely change my order.  I order a Tre Tre with blue koolaid.  When I first started going, they didn't have the blue koolaid, so I ordered the red koolaid.  On a couple of occasions, I was feeling snazzy, so I ordered the Toy Toy.  The Tre  Tre is similar to the Toy Toy.  Both have 2 pieces of chicken and a waffle.  Tre Tre - Drumsticks.  Toy Toy - Wings.  The chicken is hot and crispy.  I have had it a time or two and thought that perhaps it had been cooked and sitting in a warmer too long.  The waffles are extremely good.  I enjoy putting a little of the butter and a lot of the syrup on mine and eating my waffle from the inside out!  YUMMY!   I haven't had much else on the menu, but I've sampled the plates of folks I've been with and their food was good.  I was in there a couple of weeks ago and I see that they have added several new items to the menu.  I want to try the shrimp and grits.  The thing about this location that I like is that the service is always friendly and prompt.  This is the only place in Phoenix for chicken and waffles.  I love being waited on by a couple of guys that work there.  they are twins.  Mr C and Mr D (if I recall correctly).  Those are some nice fellas.  I have tried their Red Velvet Cake and I was somewhat surprised to find that it was a decent contender for what I would call a good Red Velvet Cake.  It doesn't rival my 1st and 2nd favorite RVC's in phoenix.  The texture of this cake is exactly moist enough and the cream cheese icing tastes creamy and sweet.  The one thing their RVC is missing is the taste of the cake.  The hint of the chocolate is not there.  I DO NOT like the raw nuts on the cake, but I can eat around that.    All in all, LoLo's is the "only" spot to get  chicken and waffles in Phoenix.

Went here today because I missed the OCT 2015 International Supper Club Unofficial Yelp Event (UYE).  Norm R was right.  This place has the best Pho in Phoenix.   This place is situated in a nondescript strip mall of Asian inspired shops.  I have literally passed it a dozen times and have never noticed it.    it looks like a bingo hall on the inside with these tables with numbers on them.  Fluorescent lights lining the drop ceiling and rectangle folding (-like) tables with 6 or 8 chairs at most of them.  The Pho is relatively inexpensive.  I didn't realize, ordering the oxtail Pho, that I was ordering one of the most expensive things on the menu at $12.  I am one of those weirdos who order Pho for the broth and the beef.  I'm indifferent about the noodles and rarely eat much of them.  The broth here is the best I've had in Phoenix.   This was a warm treat on a chilly rainy day.   The place was packed too.  I was surprised, but then maybe not.  It was a rainy cool day in PHoenix.  Who wants to be out?  Apparently others had the same thoughts as I, let's get Pho!  Return factor: 90%

I live by the "Thrice" Rule.  I'll try anything thrice.  My latest trip, which sparked this review, was a 2 star and so was the first visit.  I can't imagine what a third trip will do, but I will likely try this place again sometime in the future.    My latest experience with this nail shop was about like the first time I went there.  The staff is not very pleasant to work with.  I think the lady that did my manicure at station number 5 was unhappy that day.  She pulled and twisted on my arm as if I were some kind of rag doll.  I asked her nicely to just let me know where she wanted my arm positioned so I could put it there.  As I think about it, she was just plain rude to me during the time she was doing my manicure.  As I think about it more, this salon wasn't packed on a Friday at 5pm.  That should have been a sign.  The salon itself was clean.  There are  about 8 spa pedicure chairs and 8 stations for manicures.    If you are here looking to determine if you want to go to the nail salon, I would say try it out.  Don't expect anything glamorous and you'll be just fine.

Got a huge appetite?  Ready for savory food?  Ok, did you make a reservation?  Yes to all 3 questions?  Well, it is time to head over to the FnB.  WOWzer!  I happened to choose this restaurant by chance on a nite a friend and I were looking for some place different and nw to go to.  I'm so very happy that we did.   this is a small establishment with the kitchen practically the center piece of the small space.  The kitchen is surrounded by the bar.  If you're lucky, you can take a seat there.  BTW, you may make a reservation to be seated at the bar.  I think the restaurant is quaint and has a romantic feel to it.  (This review is based on the old location.  They've since moved.)  That night, I was so happy with the service.  The waitress was kind and thoughtful.  She was very busy.  She was playing hostess as well as waiting on tables.  She explained things on the menu and suggested drinks to us.  I don't recall the mixed cocktails, but we each had 4 different cocktails between the two of us and enjoyed the variety of the flavors in the drinks.  The cocktails were original drinks  We ordered the okra fries, I'm not sure what I was expecting, but they were just "ok" for me.  I was not that impressed by them at all.  However, the dinner was a different story.  I had a wonderful dish with duck in it and my friend had a chicken dish.  Both of the entrees were enjoyed by us both.  The menu changes frequently.  I just visited there 2 months ago and I looked on line to see if I could spefically name the dishes, but the menu is completely different!   I recommend this place for date night!!  It's also nice for out of town guests who enjoy food and think of a meal as a grand experience.

What can't I say about this place!  The Cosmopolitan has set the gold standard for casino resorts in Vegas. If you are intending to open a resort in Vegas, well, there's the model by which you should meet or exceed!  I suggest getting there early and leaving late.  Arriving to the hotel is like arriving to the set of a movie (or some island resorts if you've been to few with the epoxy drive ways, etc).  Once you turn off the main street and into the valet area of the hotel, you know for sure you are in for an ultra-hip experience.  From the fragrance that fills the air to the details of the 5 story chandelier, you know that no detail was spared the hotel. The thing that's most impressive about this resort is the casino area on the first 5 or so floors. WOW.   I beg of you - get to the Marquee early!  3 fantastic pools!  The strategy should be different for all 3.  #1 - Bamboo - go here in the morning for a more peaceful atmosphere and brunch. #2. Boulevard - check out this pool for the special events or if you want to do lunch and play some games in between soaking in the pool. LOVED it.  Louder younger crowd.. #3 Day Club pool - this is a spot for all day and night.  I believe it is connected to Marquee, but I can't really  be sure. I should have asked.  The Bond Bar - uhm basically a club, sans the $25 cover charge.  I preferred being here for that reason.  Great drinks and nice bartenders. Oh yeah, and it practically sits on the strip!  So people walking by wave at ya if you're sitting on the near side of the bar... they just basically wish they were you.  my only complaint is the Cosmo's rooms just are not as nice as Aria's rooms.  Aria has the Cosmo beat on rooms.  Other than that, no other casino can open down there and not be compared to the Cosmopolitan.

Bumpe up to a 4.  this place deserves it!  Tots Fun.  Tots Cool.  Tots The SHIZZLE!  "Dirty Bits... Dirty Bits.."  *singing*  whenever I pass this restaurant, I think of that song by the Blackeyed Peas "The TIme -- Dirty Bits" because this restaurant has these awesome Dirty Chips!   Homemade chips with blue cheese, bacon, cheese... Yums... I usually love them.  I like RnR for 2 reasons... Dirty Chips and Sunday Brunch/Day Party.  When I have friends in town, this is the place we skip church to go to for food and bottomless Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's from 10-3pm.  If you have these type of friends in town, this is a cool place to go for brunch and bypass the snooty brunch locations in Phoenix/Scottsdale.    RnR has the craziest hours of a restaurant like this... 8am - 2am.  Yes folks... I have gone here after a night out for those Dirty Chips.... Dirty Chips. *singing*  A DJ starts around 10ish.  If you have a large party, make a reservation.  Get there just before 10 to avoid the crowd.  This place calls itself a Gastropub, but I wouldn't.  I think of it as a cool local bar eatery.  Return Factor: 100%.

So, my childhood donut shop is still safe atop the donut throne.     I would never cheat on my favorite donut shop (except with Krispy Kreme a few times).  But I was drawn here after having their buttermilk donut.  I finally brought myself to stop in this donut shop after having had a Buttermilk Bosa donut a few months ago at work. What an amazingly good donut, when it is fresh.  I've had that donut 3 times and the first 2 times I had it, the donut was simply AMAZING.  Something that tastes that good scares me.  I was afraid I would be drawn to this place over and over for that donut.  So, on a weak day, when I just wanted something sweet.... NOW.  I pulled into this shop at about 4 in the afternoon.  I see the yummy "specialty donut" in the display and quickly order it.  I get in my car and I don't immediately pull off as I whip out that donut to break off the first piece.  I take a bite and I'm suddenly shocked.... disappointed.  It was STALE.  I wondered how long that donut had been in the display.  It wasn't very good.  i have resolved to never return -- a lie!  I should stop lying to myself.   Nothing that good could possibly, truly be that good.   Someone at work brought 3 dz of these donuts this week.  I resisted.  I resisted.  but I'm sure.. in that weak moment, I'm returning for that buttermilk yummy goodness.  But I've learned my lesson, I'm going first thing in the morning... I want a fresh one.  Yumms!

This is yet another urban indoor/outdoor market place that is becoming very popular in the Valley.  Think of the food court at the mall.  Independent counters to order services/food from.  Then think of a circus.  Then think of the arcade  Then think of a bar.  Ok, got all those things in mind?  cool, you've got the picture.  Things I like: 1.  My sliders were great.  The Mac and Cheese muffings were just OK for me. 2. The craziness of it all.  its like walking through the mall food court.  You might see any kind of activiy on display (i.e. Mall fashion show, Mall concert, Mall boxing ring.) 3. Those drinks:  they are winners! 4. do they have concerts here?  Geez Louise!  I'd love to attend one there.  Things I'd like to see changed: 1. Nothing.  I loved this place.  so unique and so cool.

If you don't know how to do it, I'll show you how to walk the dog! - Rufus Thomas said it waaaaay back when, but I'm saying it now.  I'll walk a dog and anything else a long way to have one of these creative tasty delicious hot dogs.  It all dates back to my childhood when I thought a hot dog, boiled in a pot of water, on an unassuming bun with a squirt of mustard and a dash of ketchup was the best a dog could get.  Then I went to Chicago/New York during my undergrad years only to  discover that more than ketchup and mustard can go on a hot dog and make it taste REAL good.  So, as my hot dog paradigm is making another shift... I want to recognize and give the appropriate YELP-out to Short Leash Dogs!  This place is quite simply Ah-mazing.  They put "stuff" together on a hot dog that I never would have imagined putting together across meals in the same day!  But these interesting toppings together  taste sooo good on a hot dog from SLD!  I've had exactly 3 hot dogs from this place and each time I'm amazed that, not only did I like the dog, I LOVED IT!  The most interesting thus far has to be the Bear hot dog.   I had it prepared Naked (that's no bun, 2x the hot dog) with the spicy hot dog.  The bear has Peanut Butter, Cracker Jacks, smoked Gouda, Bacon and BBQ Sauce on it.  Yes, you read it correctly!  Cracker Jacks and Peanut butter... If this is your first time around the block, I'm sure we had the same first thought - Are they serious?  Oh, but yes... serious as a dog about his bone!   The flavors in the bear meld together in your mouth and the taste bursts with the peanut butter and the cracker jack, just enough salty with the sweet; nutty with the mild flavor of the cheese.  I would recommend this dog to anyone!  When you go, look for the special of the week.  I think upon my next visits, I will always have the special of the week OR I will try my own hand at creating my own dog.  Be sure to try the very delicious fried pickles.    To boot, the folks working in this food truck are top-notch folks.  I find that most if not all food truck owners/employees are extremely pleasant.  Wag your tail on over to their website and check out the calendar and see where you can find their trailor.  I just heard that they have a new true bonafide truck.  Don't you want to break it in?

This place has some fantastic food.  No MSG, no corn starch, just simply the food with no fillers to bolster the flavors.  Just enter Mekong Plaza through the northern most doors and walk directly back to the food court.  You practically walk right to Hue Gourmet.  Don't let the food court atmosphere fool you.  The food here is quite tasty and the owner is happy to tell you all about the food and how they prepare it.  I have been here on several occasions for foodie lunches (got to try a lot of different things) and lunch with friends.   I've gone here for lunch most days and I'm partial to the Banh kahn cua.  I recommend this place for folks who enjoy food!  Return Potential:  90%

Late Night Problems... there are those nights at 2 am when every thing with edible food is closed.  You pull out your mobile Yelp app.  You search for restaurants that are open now.... and just some times, you find a rare 5-Star gem and wonder,  "How could I have not found this place before today."  JoBot Coffee is one of those places.  Everything about JoBot screams hipster.  It is in an ecclectic part of down town Phoenix, they serve as much local food as possible,  it sits next door to a house-pub, it is in a house itself and  the inside is retro-shic.  AND It is open 24 hours on the weekends.  I fell so deep in love with this place that I wanted to bring my cot and blanket and move in.    The selection of crepes and specials is phenomenal.   You walk up to the counter and order something good.  This IS a coffee shop, so expect brekfast-like options with tasty salads and other things.  Sit at the counter or a table inside or stroll to a table outside on the front lawn.... enjoy food.  Repeat.  Repeat.  I can't wait for my return to this restaurant.  I am sure there are more exciting things about this place that I have yet to discover.

I've been to this restaurant for lunch usually, but I stopped in for dinner on their "famous" patio.  Here's my take on this place.  Service:  Incredibly professional and wonderful staff.  Every time I have gone, the staff's attention to my every need and concern was a priority to every single person that I have encountered.  I can not say enough of how professional their staff is.  Food:  again, wonderful food that bursts with flavor.  I've had several things here to eat, my favorites are the polenta fries and the Wild Boar sausage with the pasta (I forgot the name on the menu) - incredibly delicious and bursting with a warm exotic flavor that is both satisfying and filling.  I have also enjoyed a popular dish there, the shrimp and grits.  This dish was ok for me, I think it could be better if the items on top of the grits were all placed in the middle with the cheese.    Patio:  this is why I give them a. 4.  Needs live soft music on the weekends.   The ambiance is a bit dry without it.

Y'all don't know good eatin' 'til you stopped at Jamburritos!  My tastebuds died, went to heaven.    I'm a southerner.  I DO NOT, I DO NOT, order fried catfish in restaurants outside of certain states in the south.  It just doesn't happen.  Something about folks in other states putting beer batter or breadcrumbs or  flour based breading on it that runs me outta the restaurant.  But I figured, this Mex-Cajun fusion way would  be something to try.  I ordered a fried catfish jamburrito... that's fried catfish, with jambalaya (2 staples in my kitchen) and all the other fixin's of a burrito.  I got the fire hot sauce on the side and I also ordered up the hush puppies.  They had Faygo pops (yep, I said "Pops", that's cause I'm from the South.  If you're from other southern regions, you might call it a "cold drink".) That took me back years to my childhood and I ordered up the orange Faygo.  Whoop Whoop!    So, what does this southerner say?  They killed it.  The hush puppies were absolutely delicious.  A bit on the small side in comparison to what I'm accustomed to having back home.  But exactly the taste you want in a hush puppy!  WOW.  I'm bringing my mom to the truck, I bet she hasn't cooked hush puppies since I was a kid.    The Jamburrito was something out of this world.  The taste of the jambalaya in every bite of the catfish was an amazing mixture of spiciness with the delicious cajun flavor of the rice.  And don't forget that there's also beans and all the fixins of a burrito.  The lettuce and fresh veggies help to cool the zing of the spice from the hot sauce.  if you don't like spicy, don't get the hot sauce on yours.   Here's a pic of my plate: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jamburritos-cajun-grille-express-phoenix?select=xh1Ac9X35EPQywGj9QZbnA#7gSc9b6Jr19CHMRtb40tmA  What a creative fusion of the Mexican burrito and cajun food.  I was so satisfied and  thrilled with the tastes and flavors.    I have to go back and try their friend crawfish and perhaps some other things that will take me down the Mississippi river of memories... Bravo Jamburritos!  Bravo.

How is it that I don't write reviews for places I absolutely love to go.    I think that when I truly LOVE a place, I get writer's block.  I generally don't know where to begin, so let me start with the item that drew me in.... Bacon Popcorn.  If you read my reviews, you know by now that popcorn is my favorite food.  My second favorite is bacon.  When a place takes those 2 things and puts them together in one dish, it won't take much to make me a fan, for life.  When I walk in Citizen Public House and pull up a seat at the bar, I feel like I'm in a craftsman style supper club.  The interior of the building itself is beautifully appointed, yet simple with those beautiful wooden beams.  There is a lovely patio area as well.  I've dined on several things from the menu.  I've gone for dinner with reservations and I've stumbled in late night for a bowl of popcorn and libations.    By far my favorite thing on the menu, save the Bacon popcorn, is the Chopped Salad.  I enjoy it every time I've gone.  I'm a creature of habit and it is hard for me to order something different at a restaurant when I've found something I enjoy a lot.  HOWEVER, I love it that I have some adventurous friends and I've managed to try several of their drinks and menu items.    I like the fact that they host a monthly cocktail tasting.  Come in and taste their crafted cocktails for about $65 with some food pairings.  Their drinks are adventurous, but to be honest, I've had better crafted cocktails around Phoenix.    I would give them 5 stars, but I did order something once that was not prepared correctly and I had to convince the server that it wasn't.  I didn't have to twist his arm but he tried to tell me that it was correct and etc, but I said no, I don't think so.   I suppose after the server took it to the back and examined the food item more, he discovered I was right.  They remade the item for me and the night kept going.  But that makes me wonder if the menu is being prepared correctly.  I wouldn't know, probably never will since I'm stuck on that salad. (SN: I think their chopped salad has a facebook page.)   And the menu doesn't change often enough.  Another downer is the fact that there is no audible music.  I'm on the fence if I'd want it there or not, but when I've gone, I notice I look around thinking, we could use some atmospheric music.  I also think that place would rock with a really good Jazz band playing live music there.  Please don't get me wrong, this place has excellent service.    The fact of the matter is that I will definitely be back  CPH has the chance to earn 5 stars from me.

It's one thing to wait until you're in your mid-30's to want to make some crazy changes about yourself.  You get kind of obsessed with aging gracefully.  It's a whole 'nother situation of crazy when you decide to get Braces at 35+ ---- (insert mysterious music) dum dum dum... In comes what I call, the "mid mid-life crisis".    Not sure what I was thinking.  I looked at my smile after I did a photo-shoot and I said... "Hmmm.. I want to fix my smile".  2 weeks later, I had FULL on teen-aged braces on my teeth.  Only a person in the "mid mid-life crisis" could come up with something like this and have it implemented in 2 weeks!    So, if you're reading this review and you're over 30, and you are wondering about your own "mid mid-life" crisis, let me tell ya a little about Dr Curtis to help speed you along!  ;-)  I interviewed several orthodontists, even my regular dentist who also does Invisalign,  However, Dr Allen Curtis won me completely over after my consultation with him.  I went in for my consultation, they took 3-D images of my teeth and then systematically showed me how he was going to move my teeth.  I asked a lot of questions and he answered them and I was comfortable and happy with all the answers.  Most importantly, I was comfortable with his timeline for the treatment.  See, when you are leaning on door number 40 so hard you can hear the hinges squeak, time is very important.  He didn't quote an obnoxiously short period of time or suggest I do damage to my other teeth to get things to work in my timeline.  He understands the adult patient's needs and desires.  And for that, he won my trust... and my business.  The staff?  Professional, gentle, knowledgeable and friendly.  Dr. Curtis is also such a great doctor to visit.  Visiting his office is always a WIN-WIN situation!!  Dr. Curtis is like the Wizard of Ortho, he has the coolest toys in his office!  This office has modern amenities that make me want to live in this office versus visiting it.  The free Wi-Fi, iPad in the lobby, video games, the 3-D imaging, and that CRAZY geeked out sound-system!  Even his consultation office is awesome!    My only "needs improvement" at this point is how well this office works with other offices that are also in on my treatment plan.  The two offices must communicate with each other behind the scenes so that my visits to the 2nd dentist is not confusing or wasted time. There were some hiccups there I attributed to Curtis's office.  If this improves in the future, I will definitely update  I'm still a patient (8 months in), so I'll have to update my review at the end of my treatment.    We're off to see the Dentist and The Wizard of Ortho is in the office and IT IS ALL GOOD over here in the mid-life!

I was underwhelmed with the food here.  I've definitely had better food.    The parking lot can get VERY full on weekdays for lunch.

Update 8/29/2015: I called the restaurant today because I'm befuddled by it all.  We've never had a bad experience with any of the Valley restaurants in the 2 years that we've been doing this and I owe some explanation to the people who plan around the 3rd Wednesday of every month to join Monica and me for ISCUYE.   Apparently, there are some illnesses in the business-family that are consuming their attention.  A small business like this relies on everyone in the business to operate at its best.  No doubt! I get this.  My family owns a small business.  When one person is out, everyone feels the heat.  Our August reservation was forgotten in a vulnerable moment for the restaurant.   I understand.    My review, which is not caustic by the way, will stand.  I have no hard feelings!  This review is an accurate account of the events that transpired.  BUT, at least we know WHY it happened.  We might consider this restaurant again next year.  I really wanted that bouillabaisse!  :-)  In my review below, I said "I'd never go here again", but ... I'd give a try some time next year if Monica agrees to try it out.  8/29/2015 _________________________________________________________ We scheduled the July and August 2015 International Supper Club UYE at this location.  Why on earth would we have the ISCUYE  in the same place 2 months in a row?   Welp,  definitely not because we liked the food that much.   We never actually had ANY of the food.  I'm so disappointed with the lack of professionalism by this restaurant.     The first try here we made a reservation on the 3rd Wednesday at 630 pm.   Hours prior to dinner time, they called Monica O to cancel because of an emergency.   OK,  fine.   Things happen. .   So,  we decided to reschedule for August.   Someone pointed out that the restaurant might be closed on Wednesdays for dinner.   So,  I called and left a message  inquiring about our dinner plans.   I asked if LPF would be open and gave a date,  day and time (Wed Aug 19 at 630pm).   I stated that if they were open,  please reserve a table for a 10 for Aug 19 at 630pm.  A couple days later,  I received a confirmation call/voice-mail confirming the details of the ISCUYE.     We arrive,  on time and the place was closed.   As soon as I can borrow someone's phone to record a video with the audio from the voice-mail confirming our reservation,  I will.     I waited a week to write this review because I called 3 times and left 2 voice-mails asking for a call back from someone to help me understand why they would tell me we had a confirmed reservation when they were closed   Maybe there was a good explanation.   Maybe the manager forgot they were closed on Wed.   I am not sure.  I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt.   But,  alas, it has been 8 days,  no call back.   Sadly,  I'd never go here again!   Extremely unprofessional.    But what irritates me most of all is 2 months in a row we had to scramble our plans at the very last minute because of this place.  Monica and I take a lot of pride in choosing local businesses to patronize every month.   Our fellow Yelpers rely on us to choose good AND reliable AND professional businesses.   This wasn't one.

Taquitos Jalisco serves up Mexican street food common to the state of Jalisco.  You might be more familiar with the state capital city, Guadalajara.  This particular restaurant has a "sister" property on Gilbert Road that I've heard has better tasting food than this location.  Hmmm... I may have to find out!  as this was very good Mexican street food!  There's a bandwagon forming for Taquitos Jalisco and it's making stops in Mesa!  Let me jump on the bandwagon for a ride too!  I missed the Yelper Lunch UYE here in April, but I scheduled my lunch group to go here this month.  I'd heard from Robyn N and Rand H that the place was small, but had no idea that by small they meant TINY!  The international lunch group that I organize was about 14 deep for lunch!  We were smart enough to arrive early.  Every table was taken once we got in the door.  Thankfully, it was not terribly hot outside and the tables outside were still open.  We gladly occupied those tables under the shade with the roar of the traffic on Broadway whizzing by.  I sat next to my buddy Dawn K and we split our food!  I ordered 3 carne asada Tacos and 2 Tamales.  I will say that I was disappointed with the Tacos.  The carne asada was a little dry for me.  But still tasty enough to enjoy.  The tamales were fantastic!  I split one of my tamales with the entire group so that everyone could get a taste.  But I saved the other for myself for lunch the next day!  Dawn K ordered a platter with 3 things on it.  Enchilada, Taco and a Chile Relleno.  I tried some of her Chile Relleno!  The chile relleno was extremely good.  It was my favorite thing that I tasted.    I did not try it, but one lunch'er raved about the fish tacos and Robyn N also said their fish tacos were very good.  A slip of the brain as I would have ordered that instead of the carne asada taco.  Everyone in the group was happy, even the vegetarian lunch'er was happy with his veggie burrito!  Score!  This place is worth stopping in and trying.     Remember, this is definitely a DIVE!  The parking lot is also very small.  It is on the north side of the street.  Pay attention.  The building is so small, you will likely drive past it and miss the turn.

As I sit on my "perch" on the second floor of this library, I write this review.   I absolutely LOVE coming here and I give this library my 3rd 5-star rating.  Here is why....  (Keep in mind, I'm writing this review as a working professional and not as a student of the college).  When you walk into this library, you are awe-struck by the beautiful architectural design of the building.  During the day, this library is full of bright natural light because it is surrounded by glass windows from top to bottom.  The library is a huge open air space so that the light flows from the 2nd floor down to the first floor.    I come to this library to read my own books or use their computers to do some studying.  I love to take one of the computers that faces the Southeast of the building.  There are near panoramic views of South Mountain.  The views are stunning as, I believe, this is the tallest building south of downtown.  The library provides free (for now) wi-fi.  Private study room are reservable for the public use.  State of the art media rooms that must be reserved.  There are a few things I want to keep secret.  I don't want everyone in the VAlley to know because I don't want to see this library turn into the circus at some libraries.  YOu'll have to find out for yourself.  The library is conveniently located on the South Mountain Community College Campus if you attend school or live in the area, that's a bonus.    I personally never imagined myself being that person that comes to the library weekly to read a book .  I could do this at the Starbucks up the street that I am the Duchess of.  BUT, I LOVE this place and I spend less money!  ;-)  But to be honest I do.  I'm a bonafide people watcher too, and I have found that there are other regulars to the library just like e and they all have their own interesting stories.  Some of them I've talked to and inquired about why they frequent the SML and others, I just observe quietly.

I contemplated this review the entire drive home... as I stuffed my face with the GREAT puf pufs that I got to go.  This restaurant has a LOT of 5-star ratings.  I've only given out three 5-star ratings, and I would not give this place a 5, but I was seriously contemplating the 3 or the 4.  I decided to go with 4 becasue I can't fault the sweet lady who owns this place for the lack of GOOD service from the servers.  So, I will give Fu Fu a 4 star.  Here's how my experience went.  I arrived and I was not greeted as warmly as I would have expected.  I will not dwell on how poor/untrained the service was.  I think the girls waiting on the tables need some training and the experience will be better for people.  And I should never see a place with that many people in it and one of the servers is just sitting down.  WOW, I hope Ester reads this and really works on those servers.  On to the good part!  I arrived with my mind made up about what I wanted to eat.  I had the GingerMango drink.  A little pricey, but very very tasty.  Spicy due to the ginger.  The texture was just right.  NOt too thin and not too thick.  Too much ice!  ;-)  I wanted more, basically, for $5.    I ordered the pepper soup.  It arrived with a LOT of meat in it.  I had no idea what kind of meat would be in the soup.  I just wanted to try something different and tasty.  Did not let me down!  From the taste, I knew it was an animal's stomach.  I wasn't sure what kind.  I didn't ask until I finished it.  I didn't want to hear it was pig belly until it was over!  So I ate the broth and tasted the meat.  Turns out that was Goat belly in there.  LOL, I loved it.  I really did.  If you like menudo, you'd enjoy it.  I definitely did.  For my lunch/dinner, I had the fried Tilapia and Jallof rice.  Both were bursting with wonderful flavors.  I was very happy with the fish.  The Jallof rice was also tasty and delicious.  The food was just as appealing visually.    There was a large meetup group seated in the dining room and I saw the owner come out and speak to them.  I can appreciate this lady and her business and I do love it.  As far as the music, I'm not sure if they have adjusted the volume of the music, or if some people have spidey ears.  I did not have an issue with the volume of the music.  I personally enjoyed it.  I'm tickled how much the Nigerian music sounds like western/caribbean pop/hip-hop music.  Funny how all things come full circle because African music orginally influenced some western/caribbean music and now it has gone full circle!

Slickably good!    I went here based on the photos of the ice cream sandwich.  So, if you're perusing reviews and taking a look at pics....... well....... In this case, a picture truly is worth a thousand tastes.    In a single word...  FANTASTIC  Homemade cookies.  Ice cream made in house!  cute little shop on a popular corner in Tempe.  You can't get any better, but if you could, Slicables is where you'd look.  I went with about 3 other friends one day after having dinner nearby in Tempe.  We wanted ice cream.  We.  Needed.  Ice.  Cream!  Everyone turns to me to figure out where to go.  I turn to my trusty Yelp App and discover a highly rated ice cream shop less than a mile from where we were.  So, we park on Mill Ave.  (I add this part for those who might end up making the same mistake.)  Unfortunately, we went to an ice cream shop across the street by mistake.  Watch out, that area along Mill Ave can be confusing (especially after a few glasses of wine at dinner), so be sure to use the address.  That "other" shop doesn't have the ice cream sandwich.  So, we leave that shop and cross the street and hit up the correct location.  I had a nice simple sandwich, a scoop of delicious creamy vanilla ice cream between 2 delicately sweet and chewy chocolate chip cookies.  I was more than satisfied.  I licked the sweet ice cream in the middle of the cookies and then I finally took a hefty bite of the sandwich and I was sold.    My friends had various combinations of mint and chocolate and other cookies.  They were super happy with their sweet sandwich-loves.  Being sandwiched in the middle of Tempe at Slickables is the right thing to do.  Go lick that creamy middle and thank me later!

Oh Vintage 95, I am in love with you!   This place is fantastic.  From the modern decor to the eclectic menu options.  I can't say enough about this place.  Did I mention that I like this place?  I went here for a lunch while visiting downtown Chandler.  I have had V95 on my Bookmark for a while.    First, you walk into this establishment and it is a posh modern place of beauty.  This time (Early spring/Late winter) of the year is perfect for going to a place like V95 because they can open all the doors and extend the inside outward.    I enjoyed my bruschetta board very much.  My friend and I both had wonderful glasses of wine.

A big thank you to All Pierogi Euro Kitchen for hosting us for the November International Supper Club Unofficial Yelp Event (ISCUYE).  These folks adjusted to our growing party and dealt with 2 other large parties all in the same night.  I can't thank them enough for their patience and exemplary service.  Once again, the ISCUYE has located a delightful locally owned business in an unassuming strip mall with delicious food.  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers and their amazing pictures, I decided I had to try the Pierogi and after looking over the menu, I wanted a warm and soothing cup of Ukrainian style borscht.  Ukrainian style borscht is served warm and this cup of soup was a very interesting brothy soup with finely shredded hearty root and earthy vegetables like cabbage and beets.  Someone mentioned that they were concerned about an overpowering taste of beets and that was completely unfounded.  The dollop of sour cream was just enough to make the soup creamier and add a zip of "zing" to the soup.    I also enjoyed 2 different pierogis.  I tried the jalopeno and cheddar and the bacon.  Both very delicious.  These dumplings are very similar to the Japanese Gyoza, except the Japanese dumpling is thinner.  The Pierogi is made with a thicker dough.  The Pierogi can be boiled or fried.  This restaurant serves them in multiples of 3 with a side of bacon bits (yummy!!), sour cream and roasted onions.    Give this place a try!  You will not be disappointed.   Return Factor: 85%

If I were going to be visiting a pediatrician, Dr Judy is THE ONE pediatric doctor that I would like to see.  Dr Judy explains everything, answers all concerns and she is even prepared with valuable knowledge for the "just in case"/"contingencies".  She tells you, if your child is taking this medication, you might see these symptoms and what to do if you do see them.  When I first met Dr. Judy, I honestly thought that she talked far too much.  But as I got to know her, I began to appreciate the information she provided.  I absolutely trust her knowledge and advice.  She has young children and she will honestly tell you what she'd do with her 2 or 4 year old.  She's very good about that.    The office is staffed with caring and sweet nurses.  Linda, Libby and the other ladies that work there are awesome.  I can't say how happy I am to call that office and ask questions.  I've called the office during the day with questions and I've never felt like I've called too much.  They welcome my questions and encourage it.  The office is also staffed with 2 other doctors.  I would imagine they are as wonderful as Dr Judy Clark Barnes.  NOTE: this practice was "Saguaro Pediatrics"

What a Gem in south Scottsdale!  Exceptionally great food and service.  I have gone here about 15-20 times in the past year, maybe more.  And the service has been consistently the same.    There is no secret, I love the hummus here.  Everyone knows it!  I rave about it.  I love hummus and the only hummus I've ever tasted that was better was made at the table for me.  They offer 3 different mix-ins with their hummus.  My favorite is the roasted garlic and i will often order the chipotle-something when I order the hummus plate  I have also tried 2 or 3 other things on the menu.  I have fallen in love with their "Grilled Cheese Sandwich".  I consider it to be a grilled cheese for adults.  This Grilled cheese sandwich is far more than just bread and cheese.  They also put avocado and tomato. The sandwich is simply divine.  After having the grilled cheese, i thought it was necessary for me to go for the Prima breakfast sandwich one morning.  WOW, what a yummy breakfast sandwich.  Egg, Cheese and Bacon - typical, but they throw in Pesto on this sandwich!  The Pesto is quite frankly in a food class all its own.  It is so delicious.  I order this sandwich with their 12-Grain Bread or the Wheat Bread and I love it that way.  I know that on Wednesdays, they used to offer a "hidden menu" option.  you have to be "in the know" to request it.  So, now you know.  The proceeds from the "hidden menu" option go to Muscular Dystrophy.  You have to ask about this one on Wednesdays.  The only reason I rank this place a 4 is the lack of a warm side to go with those delicious sandwiches.  I would give this 5 stars if I could get soup or fries.  I might change my mind and come back and change my rating to a 5 one day.  I'm that on the fence about this.

Named after the mountain pass that cuts through Afghanistan and Pakistan, we find Khyber Halal right here in Phoenix.... Another amazingly delicious mom and pop type restaurant.  The Phoenix Supper Club UYE visited Khyber Halal in January.  I was out of town on business, but I stopped in last month to sample a few things and I was very pleased with the offerings.     The most moist and tenderly seasoned  lamb!   Practically melts in your mouth.   Large portion.   Get the kabob with rice and order a specialty naan on the side.   Fluffy tender rice with a strong cumin flavor laced in every bite.  I don't usually eat much rice, but the house rice was a delicious treat.. The Lamb came with a Cucumber tomato onion and cilantro mixed salad.   I also ordered the Garlic naan.  nom nom nom.... The bread was perfectly tender with a lite crunch and bursting with the flavors of roasted and fresh garlic.  Deliciously spiced beef.   Reminds me more if a Jamaican beef patty,  spicier and more flavorful.   The chicken samosa is just as yummy,  but lacks the bold flavors of the beef.   Rather spicy for most Americans.  BTW: Halal means "permitted by law" in Arabic.  Halal food follows the laws for dietary needs described in the Islamic faith... humane slaughter of animals, no pork or pork by products, no animals without external ears and so forth.

I've never been to a business that operates with such efficiency.   These girls are always on time.  I'm a punctual person and I appreciate it.  This office is fairly new.  It is located in a new medical office park/building.  So, the area in which it is located looks fabulous and is clean.  The office door is right up the stairs to the right.  It is not at all difficult to locate.  The ladies in the office are professional and they know how to get the job done.  I could not be happier with the services that I've received and I will go back and complete my treatments.  One of the better $99 I've ever spent.  I am SO happy with the results!    NOTE:This is a note for women with darker skin.  This office does have YAG lasers.  If you are thinking about getting Laser hair removal and you have darker skin tones, then you want to use the YAG laser.  Google it.  It is the best laser for darker skin.  Even if you don't choose this location, I would ask if a different location has the YAG before accepting an appointment there.  I personally think that when I'm getting a cosmetic service such as this, the office should provide modern amenities that I don't get when I go to my GP, like WiFi so I can check my Yelp Messages with faster downloads.  :-)  Unfortunately, this office does not provide that service.  I wish they would.

At the base of the movie theater Esplande, sits the PERFECT cocktail Lounge/Patio for summer.  That Lounge/patio rises above the Biltmore shops at 24th Street and Camelback with the perfect north-facing Mountain views.  The kicker part about it, the misting system is SUPER cooling and SUPER awesome.  They outdoor lounge has comfy sofas and a bar serving crafted cocktails.  I went here this summer for vibes and libations with friends.  Happy Birthday Del Frisco's!   I had the most wonderful time at Del Frisco's for their 1 year birthday.  It was a scorching 115+ degrees that day and I'm not sure what made me think it would be ok to hang out outside in their outdoor lounge.  It was hot in the moments before the sun went down, but once that sun went down, their super misters seemed to kick it into high gear and it was extremely comfortable up there.   My friends and I hung out in their well misted outdoor lounge.  A local band played exciting and entertaining soulful music for the anniversary.  There was dancing... I like to dance.  I danced.  I laughed and I danced some more.  I ordered my favorite DFG cocktail.  I'm totally into spicy crafted cocktails and DFG has a decent spicy drink.  Every girl loves a "hottie" and Del Frisco has one of those too.... the Biltmore Hottie (Rum, simple syrup, jalapeno and lime)...  That hottie is something special.  A must try if you enjoy spicy drinks.  Thank goodness for DFG.  I have a great place to sip cockails while overlooking Camelback Mountain.  Try it, YOu will love it too.

Meh.... I think this is my first resto 1-star review.    Went here on Labor Day.  Must be the slowest day of the year for restaurant businesses.  Many restos were closed and this was the first place on my "to try list" that I found open after calling several other places.  I wish I had stayed away, perhaps had McDonalds?  Perhaps kept calling down my list?   I was seated on the bar side.  The bar side has around a 12 top bar and about 6 or so tables.  I saw 4 different guys/servers/bartenders taking food/drink orders and delivering food and drinks.  I could sense there was chaos in their service, so when they came to take my drink order, I stopped the guy from quickly leaving my table and ordered my food.  Food came out... great.  I'm eating.  Now, I want my beer.  BUT, I must have been invisible after my food was delivered.  None of them came back to my table.  I wanted to try one of the craft beers.  I saw other people being serviced at the bar and their tables and  trying and ordering them.  I just kept waiting and thinking, some1 will come to my table next.  Hum, no.  So, I gave up on ordering the beer, since I had finished my brat.  I waited and waited and attempted to signal for my check.  Nada. Zilch.  I had to finally yell out for my check.  "Ahhhh, can I get my check, today?"    Needless to say, I know where I'm unappreciated.  My dollars can go some place else.  I hate I had to spend my money there.  If I could have un-eaten the food, I would have so I could keep my money in my pocket!  As for the food, it was just ok.  Perhaps in a month I could be convinced to return, today, I don't see me ever going back there..  To borrow from yelper J.D....  Return Factor:  1%.

Feels like part-carnival, part-picnic, and part-mall-food-court!    I've rarely eaten in one of those places and was disappointed!    This is Phoenix's amazing stab at the good life of trucking good food that Food trucks in places like NYC provide.  In my opinion, Phoenix knocks it out of the park!   The event happens every Friday during the lunch time from 11-1:30pm.  The trucks form a perfect rectangle around the tables in the middle, making it easy for you to eyeball your next stop while you chomp down on your food.  Food truck Friday's has been on my to-do-list for a while.  After hearing how good the Jamborritos were at the recent Food TV food truck event that was held a couple Saturdays ago on the coldest day in Phoenix in a couple years, I decided I would check it out and today was perfect at 70 degrees!  :-)    I came there with a friend and a very highly opinionated 3 y/o who is ripe for a Yelp! account of her very own!   So, we visited the Short Leash Dogs to get the 3 y/o's meal outta the way!    We walked around the perimeter of the trucks to observe the menus of the other trucks and make mental notes of where we wanted to visit the next time.  Our mission was to try the Jamborrito's from Jamborrito!  The food there didn't let us down.  What I like best about each truck that we stopped by to say "hi" and read the menus is that EVERYone is so friendly and chatty.  I like talking and I love chatty people.  For those that are visiting and are not familiar with the parking situation in that area, there is some street parking.  there is a strange parking lot directly south of the PPM where you can park.  you must pay cash.  Today, each parking space was $6 and you slip the cash in the slot for your parking spot number.  There are other parking lots around, but I don't know on a weekday if those lots are free or paid.  On the weekend, for the PPM, they are free.  My one and only complaint about this place is that there aren't more trucks!   LOL, but other than that, this is such a wonderful and great atmosphere to enjoy.

Once again, I'm reminded of a place I visited and that I enjoyed, but allowed to drop off my food radar.  I guess for a while I traveled so much last year that it's not too hard to imagine I'd forget about a few places.  I remember my first 2 stops in to the brick and mortar of what used to be Trucking Good Food.  I really did enjoy the food.  Almost a year since my last visit and today was no different.  I stopped in today for a lunch, solo.  I ordered the Buffalo Chicken savory crêpe and I also ordered the Sugar/Brûléed Crêpe just to have a taste.  The Buffalo chicken crêpe http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cr%C3%AApe-bar-tempe?select=QcNdkQMEQXf1U1YcdRRfmA#gouRfEaEXqFqRmQbKNUsOw was sided with a shaved pickled carrot mixture.  I don't eat a lot of "bready" foods, but by gholly, this is one dish that I can just dig into.  The buffalo-blue cheese sauce was delicious.  Not as spicy as I like, but still good and definitely not to salty as some sauces like this can be.  The sauce was not in a quantity to make the dish messy and hide the texture of the crêpe.  The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.  I loved it.  it would have been nice to have some fresh bleu cheese with it though.    I should have gotten something on my sweet crêpe.  I thought the Sugar Crêpe would  be a little sweeter.  Still, it was delicious for a small taste of something sweet after lunch with a cup of coffee.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cr%C3%AApe-bar-tempe?select=QcNdkQMEQXf1U1YcdRRfmA#MY2V3YAlEVwkb5yXIhCfgw  I discovered that the Crêpe bar now carries Hayden Flour Mills products.  The fact that this company is attempting to bring back native grains to AZ is a great story.  If you're not familiar, check it out.  http://www.haydenflourmills.com/  You can buy some of their products at CB now.    My last review still stands!!!!  Where are the duck fat fries?  I did ask about the, but it looks like there is no plan to bring them back.  I have to monitor Facebook and Twitter to find out if they are on special.  which pretty much means, I probably won't have theirs again.  *sad face*

So, I heard about this place via another Yelper's check-ins the same week I read about it on one of the food bloggers.  So, I bookmarked it.  Oh Wowzer!   If you're in your car reading this review and looking for a place to eat... Uhm... Go here.  I will be honest, I've not ventured into other options on their menu.  I've been stuck on the first thing that I tried here.  The garlic chicken is simply amazing.  A very spicy and flavorful dish that lights your taste buds up and sets your mouth aflame.    Don't be afraid to stop in here because it is very small.  There is an option to sit in the tiny dining room.  There may be 6 3-top tables in the dining room.    Whatever you do. Please be patient.

It is not difficult for breakfast place to make me happy.   The Park didn't fail.   In fact,  they succeeded at making me a fan.   One of the things I like about this location is that it is steps away from the Wigwam resort.  Just exit the Wigwam from the west gates and walk to the corner of Wigwam and Old Litchfield.     The inside of The Park is also very cute with a loft-like feel to it with exposed brick and air ducts.     I've been here a handful of times and I had the same thing, the Veggie Omelet with the cheese and a side of bacon.  Perfectly cooked omelet each time.  Professional service folks who know and understand the meaning of "service industry".  Many folks love their French Press coffee.  I thought it was a good cup as well.  If you are at the Wigwam and want to get out but not go far, this is a SOLID option for breakfast or lunch!  YOu will enjoy it.

Was there moments after it opened for the first time yesterday and was back today.  New and beautiful.  Spinning theater is the neatest feature of this gym.  My favorite feature is the number of step mills.  I should not have to compete for the use of those.  There are several racquet ball courts and basketball courts.   I will update after I have taken classes there.

I had decided that I was not giving in to the "Pig-themed" restaurants.  I mean "Pig", "Pork" and "Swine" restaurants are popping up everywhere!  But I noticed that, no matter how hard I tried to ignore P&P, it would pop-up on all of the foodie sites that I check around Phoenix.  So, for several months, I scoped this place out... checked out this restaurant online and with daily drive-bys in my daily commute.  I finally decided 2 months ago that I needed to check out P&P.  I was sold, food-whipped on my first visit and I've been every week since.  They source all their veggies locally.  They make as much as they can in house from the meats on the chacuterie tray to the pickled veggie/items that appear on every dish.  They even bake their own bread!  I fell in love y'all, with a Pig & Pickle.  This restaurant is in a nondescript strip of shops.  I could not tell you what stores exist adjacent to P&P.  It is off the well "beaten Scottsdale Rd" path, and yet, the food is exciting, relevant and has a depth of flavors that is unbelievable.  I'm a fan of P&P and once you give it a try, I think you will be too.  I have tried a few things on the menu, let me start with the crafted cocktails - pricey, but still yummy and worth every penny.  They carry premium spirits and they make just about everything that goes in those crafted drinks from scratch.  If you don't want to spend $12 per cocktail, they have a wonderful HH menu with $5 cocktails from 4-6pm. Satly Dog: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=aG_8tn9ZxqvTDDwRB-tfhA#wshXHwfqyLloLxHV7g86eQ    The star of P&P is the food.  I have tried several things on the menu and I'm happy to say that not one thing was even remotely disappointing.  Everything that I've been served there was 4 Stars and above.  My favorite item thus far was on the new brunch menu.  P&P started serving brunch this past Sunday.  After church, I stopped in and ordered the Bloody Sconnie and the Bacon, Andouille Sausage and Aisago Cheese Fratta.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=f-ez6J4BhI4U2Gk_Brvr7Q&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA  An extremely delicious dish that is really more like a crustless quiche.  This dish has a serious (and I mean SERIOUS) kick to it.  It is not for the people who can't handle spicy food.  This dish was excitingly delicious.    My 2nd favorite was the braised pork belly http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=od8GMSNVUu4fAT3H1IoqcA&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA   The braised pork belly sat atop a delicious mound of mashed turnip bottoms.  The pork belly provided the right amount of saltiness that was balanced just right by the sweetness of the apple butter.  The arugula top the creation was just the right amount of earthiness to pair with the turnip bottoms.  I love all the flavors.  But as I told my mom, it was almost like eating a southern meal that contained ALL these ingredients, but prepared somewhat differently!      During Happy Hour, they offer a chacuterie plate http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=n62C4gnnQkajkiORQ-tpaw&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA that is HUGE for the $5 that they charge!  In this pic, the chacuterie included bacon butter to spread on my homemade pretezel bread.  YUMMY... YUM is all I can say!    To top it off, they have the nicest guys working behind the bar.  I mean... honestly, part of what makes my day when I go into a place like this are cute guys who can mix a drink and order up some food for me to eat.  Clayton and Scott are awesomely attentive and I just love sitting at their bar!    My to try list (because I trust everything on their menu): Shrimp and Grits Braised Duck Leg Croque Madame Salmon Tot - 6/30/2013 - 4star.  Pork Shoulder Tostadas  Each 3rd Monday of the Month, join them for Beer Dinner 6:30pm.  I'm hopeful they will have other events in the future.  I think their crafted cocktails would be a great thing to center an event around.  Oh gosh, they have free wi-fi too!  This is a gem in Scottsdale/Old Town.  Eat, Pig out and Enjoy!

I'm not sure how I could be such a fan of this place and not have written a review!  Gadzooks!  Eee gadz!  And gee whillikers!    Gadzooks is located in the heart of midtown Phoenix.  It is on a very busy corner at 7th Street and Osborn.  But, fortunately, there are no valets for parking!  You may self park your own car and I love that.  I'm the odd ball yelper.  I don't go here for the Enchiladas.  I go here for the soup part.... Yeah, uhm....did you notice the word "Soup" in the name of the restaurant?  Hehe...  I love their tortilla soup so much that I could easily eat it a couple times a week.  You can chose the meat/toppings to add to your soup or chose the grilled veggies.  These options are the same for the tacos and enchiladas.  I also add a touch of Pico de Gallo and a bit of the Hot salsa.  Perfection in a bowl for me.  They also serve a corn chowder that I have yet to try.  Actually, I found my favorite item and I just basically stick with it.  Jajajajajaja!  Return factor:100%.... I'm headed there now.

I'm moving my review to the correct page.  Unfortunately, the name is mispelled on this page.  its confusing because searching doesn't turn up the right page.  I wrote to Yelp Help about this.  Correct spelling Huauchinago.  Link to correct page http://www.yelp.com/biz/huauchinango-mesa#hrid:nWlYQPQOS5PXc2zqoyM4iw/src:self  Ok, I'd forgotten about this restaurant.  They moved a while ago from their SoScott location (that may have been in Tempe) on McKellips.  So I basically forgot about them.  I was searching for this restaurant on Yelp/Google after a discussion about my taste in MX food.  Come to find out, when Huauchinango reopened in the new location, the person that submitted this business page on Yelp spelled the name wrong!  So my search would turn up nothing on Google and Yelp.  I figured the resto was out of business.  Then like magic, another Yelper mentioned it in Yelp Talk.  I caught the misspell by a Yelper today and searched on that and bam... IN BUSINESS!  Yes, this is some really good food from a bonafide-hole-in-the-wall joint.  Makes me wanna do the happy dance when I used to eat their tamales.  So of course, after finding them in the search today, via a Yelper mention, I knew I had to go here tonight!  I'd waited for 2 years!    No tamales as they were out and would be making more for the next morning.  I will return soon for the tamales.  I'll stop in for lunch this time or, call ahead to make sure they have them.  So, no tamale tonight --- that's ok, I stuffed my face with a couple tacos.  I had the carnitas and the beef tongue tacos.  Both delicious and yummy.  I ordered chicken enchiladas for lunch tomorrow.   In true pig-out fashion, I took a bite of that and the enchiladas are far better than I remembered them being when they were on McKellips.  Just the right amount of salt-ness with enchilada sauce and cheese on top.  I top everything with something spicy.  their spicy habanero salsa adds the right amount of kick to it.  Also on my to have-again list from Huauchinango would be the mole (mo'lay).  I would easily give this play 5 stars if I could drink alcohol there and they don't  accept credit cards!!!  Oh Lord, please get the Square or something!  However, after I'm reminded how good the tamales are, I may come back for an update next week.  Stay tuned.

This is a place where your tastebuds could just run wild.  Wellllll, let's face it, tastebuds AND waistlines run a'muck in this froyo smorgasbord!   You walk in here and they set you up for failure.... the first choice you have to make is super large cup or extra-super large cup for your froyo.  From there, proceed to the line of froyo machines.  They have about 12 different flavors of creamy cold froyo to choose from.  Oh, don't forget to grab the little sample cups!  Try out a flavor or three.  My favorite being the salted caramel, I head straight for that machine.  Once you have your froyo in your super-sized bowl, you head for the toppings... Yaaay!  More calories to top off that super-sized bowl of tasty frozen awesomeness!   Now you have your toppings, head on over to the scale and get it weighed.  .49 per ouce!  Yikes... you just spent $6 on 1500 calories worth of good food.  Best $6 you'll ever spend.    Make sure you come back and do it again!

I FINALLY made it in to the ever popular Portillo's.  I wanted to go for the opening night UYE, but it was just too cold for my thin blood.  So, I waited to go here for a Yelper luncheon.  I met up with  Mike C., Georgie M, Rand H and Marvin A.  Only girl in the group and that was fine by me!    What an amazingly delicious place.  I left there thinking, I understand the excitement.  What's baffling to me is how a place so big can do, at least, one thing so well.  This was my first time taking a "dip" in the Portillo's family of restaurants.  I've been to Chicago plenty, lived in the burbs for a short while, but never heard of Portillo's.  No matter, what I lacked in hearing, I made up for in tasting yesterday.    Oh yeah... this place has been open about 3 or 4 weeks now and the crowd has yet to die down.  I highly doubt that the crowd will.  At any rate, I get there just before 11am and you can tell by noon the place would be packed.  There was a very short line that I hop in to place my order.  I checked out the menu before I arrive and then I wrote down my order so when it was time to order, I just read off my little piece of paper.  But, to be honest, I don't know where their menu is displayed.  I did try to take a last minute peek to see if I wanted to change my order, but I remember thinking, " I don't see the menu, just stick to the script."  I pay and then I wait for my number to be called.  The place is REALLY REALLY LOUD, so you definitely need to pay attention for you number to be called.    I ordered the half sausage/half beef sandwich - Dipped baby Dipped and with hot and sweet pepper and mozzarella cheese!  What a simply delicious sandwich.  I RARELY eat bread, but I wanted to devour the bread.  the bread was firm, yet soft.  It has a subtle hint of Italian spices that you can definitely taste.  I highly recommend adding the mozzarella cheese for that reason.  I wish I had my sandwich DOUBLE DIPPED!  or more gravy on the side!   I didn't enjoy the sausage, and I would never order that again.  I also ordered the fries.  This is where I kinda got irritated.  YOu can't order a salad for less than 5 dollars there.  I wanted a simple side salad with my sandwich.  I need a reasonable option to make up for the calorie bomb!  But they don't offer a small salad, so I ordered the fries.  Definitely some of the best tasting fries I've had in quite sometime.  The perfect amount of salt with a crisp exterior while hiding the soft warm middle.    I will definitely go back.  I hope sooner than later.

There are places on this site that get 5 star reviews and I wonder why.  And then, there are those places that get 5 star reviews and I think that it is so well deserved.  Miu's Cuisine is one of those places.  This is the kind of place that moves the 5-star-review-bar just a little bit higher for future establishments!   I don't even know where to begin.  My palate and my mind have been blown completely away by the flavors that I experienced tonight.  Thank you Norm R for organizing the UYE.    I ordered the Spicy Lamb Ribs and the Garlic Pork Belly, both were delicious items.  The Spicy Lamb Ribs dish is seasoned with the Schezchuan pepper.  That pepper is not in the family of HOT like the jalapeno.  That pepper makes your mouth tingle and feel numb when you eat the food.  There was an appropriate balance of salty with the zingy-ness of the pepper.  I came to learn when our dinner was over that the chef toned down the spice level for my American palate.  I'll say that is a huge mistake because I wondered why they would give that a 4/5 star hot star rating.  They should have asked me.  I will be sure to request the correct spice level if I order that again.  Fortunately for me, I had dinner there with about 10 other Yelpers (Jeff E, Laura I, Jared R, Chrystalle B, Tom S, Liz S, Norm R, Robert O, John M, Teresa S and Mario C).  We all were happy to pass our dishes around for others to sample -- family style.  So I had my share of food there tonight.  I found that my palate was partial to the schezchuan style and not as partial to Cantonese.  No surprise there, I LOVE spicy foods.  These are my favorites from tonight in order.  Cumin Flavored Lamb Water Boiled Fish Spicy Lamb Ribs Braised Eggplant Pork Belly In Garlic Sauce (Kinda hard to chew) Combination Fried Rice (I was going to skip this, but had a last minute taste.  SO GOOD!!!!!!) Sauteed Green Beans Seafood w/sizzling Rice Cake  To put it into perspective, the Seafood w/sizzling Rice Cake would get a 4.5 Star from me.  At the bottom of the favorite list and at the top of the NEVER AGAIN list would be: ANYTHING with bitter melon. (Yikes, not good that bitter melon).  My Wish List: Salt and Pepper Squid War Wonton Soup Roasted Duck Any of the Reservation Only Seafood dishes.  I didn't mention the ambiance, the service or the location... all not so great, but with the food being a solid 5+ Stars, who cares if its located on the moon, I'd go there.  Let's hope the service improves.  The servers just need to improve their efficiency.  Albeit, they are extremely nice and accommodating!!   Go here.  Period. Mini Update: I've thought about how slowly food came out.  it was actually nice so that plates of food could be passed around and sampled.  and empty plates could be removed to make room for the next plates.  If everyone's food had come out within 5 or 10 mins.. then some food would have been cold  by the time you get to it, etc.  I like the way the plates trickled out, in hindsight.

This place is fascinating!  Here is a greenhouse sitting on the Farm at South Mountain that I've walked past many times when I have visited the farm in the past.  I decided to stop in the greenhouse this weekend.  What an amazing place.  If you like plants, cacti and/or succulents, this is the place for you!  No, this is a MUST see place for you.  When you first walk in, you are greeted by a sign high above that says, "These are not for sale".  I think to myself, "oh, what is this place?"  Come to find out, most of the plants are "not for sale" and are a part of the owners personal collection.  Most of the cacti and succulents at Succulentia are indigenous to Africa.  The owner is a collector.   But there are plenty of cacti and succulents that are for sale and definitely so much to see.  There is a sign in the are of the greenhouse where the plants are for sale.  You can tell that the owner takes great pride and care of these beautiful plants.   This is a beautiful greenhouse to visit.  I took a ton of pictures that I am posting with whatever information I can recall about the plants.  I hope you enjoy!  Go to the farm and check out Succulentia, you won't be disappointed.

Update:  So, I told my dining buddy about my experience here and he was interested in checking it out.  My second stop in was a 4, makes an avg 3.5 for me which means, I'm bumping this review up to a 4 Star.    My previous experience was dampened by the over-bearing people sitting at the bar with me who talked loud and were just pretty annoying.  So, my friend and I made a reservation and we were seated in a comfortable table on the inside as it was too cool for the patio.  The dining room is fairly small, but it is nice and elegantly done.  OH, I recommend a reservation.  This was a week night and it was pretty full at 8pm.  Here's a very quick run down of what we had in my 2nd trip:  Cocktails - liked 'em so much we had 2 of each. 1. Strawberry and Basil Cocktail - sweet, tasty and a winner. 2. Farmer's Margarita - extra jalapeno did the trick for me.  Appetizers 1. Fries - MUST have.  AWESOME. WONDERFUL. DAMN Good!  Ketchup is fav sauce. 2. Fried Ribs - Again, a winner.  Sauce is awesomely good. 3. Shaved Carrots - Delicious 4. Fried Brussel Sprouts - with dollop of yogurt on the side, still not a winner for me.  This time not burnt, but barely chewable.  I want to like this dish so bad!!!!  Entree - we were too full to order 2. 1. Bolognese - simply stunningly delicious.  This dish replaces the traditional pasta with a dense and hearty piece of garlic bread and is topped with fresh parm.  Most certainly a hearty and filling dish.  Simply delicious.  Quite possibly among the best Bolognese I've had.  Pic -  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/binks-midtown-phoenix?select=Wbe27DhUqSCO843J8fhmPQ#aE_ejhNuLJ8zoS7K4_ZsJw _______________________________________________________________ 1st Visit (Last week) I went there alone on my "Date Myself Night".  I was starving which may have set this place up for a 3-star review.      I chose a seat at the bar in the 8pm hour of a week night.  I was told that my server/bartender was busy, but would I like a drink.  "Suuuuuure, of course.  Where's that cocktail menu? "  I tried the Farmer's Margarita $11 - a great drink that they could kick up the spice/jalapeno on a little bit and put a dash, or two more of tequila in.  Despite the "mods" on the margarita, it was still a creative decent drink that I would order again with the extra spice to kick it up a notch.  For dinner, I ordered a few things.  Everything on the menu is under $30.  The menu is broken into a couple of sections.  Cold and Hot sides.  Appetizers and Entrees.  I had one of the Fried Spare Ribs, the small chopped salad and the fried brussel sprouts.  The Fried Ribs were just fine.  The sweet/hot sauce that came with it was the star of the night in my opinion.  The kick of heat in that sauce was at an excellent level to allow the sweet zing of the sauce to explode in my mouth.  I loved that sauce, but too bad I had to eat that rib with a fork.  Oh, the horror that dental appliances put me through!  I digress.  I enjoyed the chopped salad, but it was certainly not what I would have expected from a chopped salad.  I expected the salad to have a little more seasonal veggies in it and a little lighter on the lettuce.  Still a yummy salad.  The one item that was not as appealing was the brussel sprouts.  They taste pretty good, although I would have eaten anything at that point, but they looked like they had been brunt in the cooking process.  They were all browned too far.  Here's a pic of what I expected http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/binks-midtown-phoenix?select=ziN4xNNDOrEKIRKbAUUK5w.  See there is evidence of green there.  And the dollop of yogurt was a bit much in the middle of the brussel sprouts dish.  I should have asked to put on that on the side.     I thought the atmosphere was nice and the service was stellar.  After reviewing the notes I took that night, i completely forgot to mention, in my rush to review, the fact that all the beer on tap was Arizonan beer.  A detail definitely worth an update. Sun up, Four Peaks and a couple other AZ beers.  I thought that was awesome!   Parking is complimentary valet here, so bring some cash.  In general, I wouldn't write a review after a night like that night because there were a few annoying things that occurred that affected the ambiance for me and brought down my experience that really isn't a reflection on the business, just the loud mouth idiots.  I plan to go again with a friend so we can try out the patio.   I will update!

A place that puts turkey, cranberry sauce and dressing (stuffing for non-southerners) on a crusty bun deserves a 4 star or better rating.   Geesus people that's an insane sandwich.    I had lunch here recently with Rand H, Mike C and Robyn B.  Met Jackie C for the1st time.     For lunch,  I stuck with the "more of the middle road" and ordered the Capistrami... Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and coleslaw.  But instead of having mine on a toasty bun, I had mine with a bit of lettuce in a bowl.  A fantastic bunless sandwich and since this particular sammie is quite the messy one, I'm happy I could eat this one with a fork.  For those who love sandwiches, their's come in 9, 12 and 15 in bun sizes.  Uhm yeah... BIG, HUGE and Gigantic.    I'll definitely return to this place.  I may work up the courage to try the Bobbie, but until then, I'm fine with the Capistrami!

I averaged my rating based on Oct 2012 (5Star) and April 2013 (3.5 Star)  The Arizona Jazz Festival is one of the nicest/prettiest music festivals I've attended.  Normally, festivals are held in these huge fair grounds with dirty dust being kicked up everywhere.  But what is so wonderful and nice about the AZ Jazz festival is that it is held on the beautiful grounds of the Historic Wigwam Resort http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-wigwam-litchfield-park#hrid:-Yra83fScX6aPuKW8hLBSQ.  My review in this link tells you how I feel about the Wigwam.  As for the musical selection at this "jazz" festival, it is a common tongue in cheek comment  that this is not a real Jazz festival because the major draws to the event are "neo-soul" and "old school R&B/Soul" performers.  A fellow Yelper, Reese J, commented that the festival should be renamed "Arizona Soul Festival".   Nevertheless, the fun atmosphere and talented draws are certainly worth the money and time.  So for a little FYI:  This festival was previously held at the JW Marriott.  This festival is put on every 6 months in October and April.  I attended both the October 2012 and April 2013 events.    My friends and I bought hotel packages for each event.  If you live locally and you live out in Mesa, consider it.  The convenience of running to the room at 4pm after sitting in the sun and heat to take a quick shower and change can't be beat.  As well as not having to drive an hour to get home.  As I stated, I attended Oct 2012 and April 2013.  In Oct 2012, the festival set the bar extremely high.  I sent them feedback and my only "needs improvement" comment was "get an after party".  Litchfield park has no night life.  Capitalize on that.  They didn't do any better on Friday night in April 2013.  The lineup in April '13 was far better than Oct '12.  But less Jazzy and more Soul.  So, in April 2013, all they had to do was maintain the BEAUTIFUL experience I had Oct '12, but they fell short.  here's where I was unhappy.  -The Will Call line  AWFUL on Friday night.  I missed the entire Will Downing Concert because of it.  Suggestions: Have lines based on last name.  A staff person in the hotel lobby during check-in hours of 3:30 - 5:30 to hand out tickets to hotel pkg people.  Separate Will call for VIP.     -Drink Tickets!  ANOTHER unnecessary line. Suggestions: Presale drink tickets online. And/OR Use a mobile app so folks can buy the tkts at their seats and get in line to buy drinks.   -OverCrowded!! Suggestion: Reduce the Max Capacity.  Get a new, larger Venue.  In October 2012, people danced at their seats as there was more room.  Since we were packed in there, you didn't see that very much.    -Entrance to Festival Area.   lines were long and the VIP line was largely empty. Suggestion: Run the entrance like the TSA does the security chk points at the airport.  The TSA person checking the boarding pass/ID of the 1st class passengers ALSO checks coach-class folks when there is no 1st class person is in line.  Apply that concept here too!  Anyone taking tickets should never be doing nothing (excuse the double negative) when you have a long line.  -Guarantee Event exclusivity  the resort members scheduled an event on top of this event.  I can say that many people felt there was some bias there.  I'll leave that comment there.  My experience in Oct 2012 was extremely pleasant.  I could not imagine a festival being done better.  Apr 2013 was just ok for me.  The AZ Jazz Fest has my support in Oct 2013.  I'm hoping they use a sensible cap this time.  But I'm not sure how I will support this event in Oct 2013.  I'll have to evaluate the pricing and then make my decision.  Update: one thing I forgot to mention: They had more vendors this time around than in Oct 2012.  That may have contributed to the lack of space.  You may like it.    I also didn't comment that every single act was amazing.  The shows almost always ran exactly on time and finished on time. I especially love that.

I hate to give this place less than a 3 star review.  I am giving it this because the cost-to-experience ratio is skewed.  This place, in my opinion is not worth $19 Adult and $9 for kids.  You can also spend more and see a light show and some other things.  My opinion would be to visit the butterfly exhibit at the Desert Botanical Garden.  You spend about 4 or 5 dollars more, but you can have the same butterfly experience AND tour the beautiful garden.    I could not make the connect in this place between the amazon fish and the butterflies.  I guess the fact that the conservatory is like a rain forest... so the Amazon is in a rain forest, so include fish in this exhibit.  Ok.  I got it.  not really.  I could understand the stretch to include the bees, but I could not understand why they included ants, scorpions and spiders.  There may have been posted signs to explain, but I don't recall seeing why these creatures were at Butterfly Wonderland.  It seems to me as though, at the last minute they decided to throw in some sharks and fish and some bugs to help extend the exhibit.  Furthermore, their guides/employees are not as helpful or informative as the DBG Butterfly exhibit.   I would have expected guides to be walking around and basically talking to people to share the information, like in other butterfly conservatories I've visited.    The 3 bright spots were the 3D film and the butterfly conservatory ...  because of the butterflies AND the wonderful climate-controlled humidity of the rain-forest like atmosphere.  Oh how I loved that humidity.  I didn't want to leave.  Don't be silly and wear jeans or you'll be very hot.  The 3rd bright spot was certainly the Butterfly emergence... watch butterflies emerge from their chrysalises (some of them look like piece of jewelry!) and spread their wings for the first time.  AMAZING show right there.  Perhaps this place is worth a one-time visit.  For me I wish I had saved my money.

The allure that drew me into this parking structure for my most recent flight out of Sky Harbor was the fact that I could pull up to the "Early bird curb-side check-in" at the parking garage, drop off my bags at my leisure, check-in to my flight, park and the take the PHX sky train to the terminal.  Certainly seemed like a huge convenience.    This parking structure is located directly East of the airport.  Follow the signs to the entrance of the lot.  Take your ticket upon entry.  Keep in mind that you can do the easy check-out, so, remember to take your ticket with you and pay by the elevators when you return.  Once you get your ticket, the fun part begins, pull up to the Early-bird curbside check-in to drop off your bags and check in.  Be mindful that you MUST be checked-in by 90minutes before your flight or their computer systems will not allow them to check you in or take your bags.  The curb-side check-in window is 4hrs - 90mins before your departure time.  Don't learn the hard way, as I did.  I got there at 90mins til.  By the time I got my bags out and walked up to the counter, it was about 87 mins until my flight, I could not be checked-in.  It also sucked to lug that luggage from the parking garage to the terminal.  It took me exactly 1hr from the curb-side to the gate!  1 hour.  --- BUT WAIT.  The kicker part?  I would have been there in plenty of time if, on the way out of my community, I had not thought to stop at the ATM machine to pick-up cash to tip the curb-side check-in guys!  hahaha!  Oh well, such is life!  The curb-side check-in service is currently ONLY available for USAir and Southwest customers.  Currently, it is not available for International travelThe hours are from 4am - 6pm, Daily.   Definitely check the website to confirm this information as it may change over time.  Once you've checked-in to your flight, park your car.  If you park on in the covered structure above ground level, be mindful that you will need to come back to the first floor and then get on the Skytrain elevator to catch the Sky Train to the terminal.  The fee to park here is $9/day uncovered and $11/day covered.  My tab after parking there for 2 days and a cpl hours?  $33.  Given the amount it costs to park at this lot and the fact that it took me 1-hr (includes the time I spent at the curbside) to get to my gate, I've decided that I won't use this parking structure again.  I will continue to use the satellite parking lots that have covered parking AND drop me off at the airport curb-side.  That takes less time and I am pretty sure I have never spent $33 for parking at Sky Harbor.

How is it possible that I've not written a review of CB&C?  WOW.  Let. Me. Fix. That. Right. Now.  Ok,... I have my laptop... Let me Yelp this!  I have been to CB&C several times over the past year.  I love their creative BURGER options.  Their burgers are great.  They have these extra-neat ordering "forms" in which you can "Build Your Own Burger".  Toppings range from cheese to eggs to grilled tomatoes.  Pro-tip: On Wednesday nights, you can "Build Your burger" and fries for $10.    But, of course, it is just like me to continue to come back to this place, NOT for the Cold Beers and NOT for the CheeseBurgers.  I have had a single burger here in all the times I have gone.  So, what have I been eating you wonder?  For heaven's sake, my weakness is french fries and chips and this place has THE BEST Tater Tots EVER.  On top of it, they have Buffalo Chicken Tots and Cots in which sliced chicken, blue cheese and hot sauce are drizzled/sprinkled over the Tater Tots.  Talk about Tater Tot heaven!  Simply divine.  I hosted a large group here on their patio.  The service was just OK for me.  We had a party of about 28-32 people, but one server.  That annoyed me big time.  The server was nice and cordial, she just didn't have enough hands to move things along faster for a work lunch group.  Alas, I still love this place.  Another great deal, they have a dang-on awesome Yelp Check-in offer too.     How anyone can justifiably rate a place called "Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers" below 3-stars is baffling to me.  My return factor is 100%.

I have always been a huge fan of Short Leash Dogs.  I just recently had dinner there with a close friend. The "Brick and Mortar" Short Leash dogs is located in the historic artsy Roosevelt District with all of its eclectic shops and gallerias and beautiful murals on buildings sprinkled around the district.   I have traditionally ordered the Bear Hot Dog at SLD.  It has been my staple.  When you look at the ingredients, you think... "Who puts peanut butter, bacon and cracker jacks on a hot dog"?  But once you give it a try, you realize, these flavors are amazing together.  I usually enjoy the fried pickles, however the last batch (see below) were a bit different and not as appetizing.  On my most recent visit, I went off script and tried the Bacon Wrapped Chedder Brat with the warm potato salad.  This was a bit of a let down.  I didn't care very much for the brat because the skin was a little thick and the taste wasn't there for me.  I definitely disliked the warm potato salad for many reasons, starting with the fact that it seems like a saucy-soupy mess. If I had known it would be so saucy, I would have passed.  There was a kid in the bunch, so we ordered a Strawberry donut.  The young child took one bite of the donut and said "Bleh" and pointed to her tongue.  YIKES.  Maybe those donuts are for adults only?    I had to kick them down a notch for the last meal.  Albeit, this is one of my favorite places to dine in Phoenix and I will definitely be returning.  Return Factor: 90%

What is a "Coney Dog?", you ask.  "Definitely not a chili dog" is what has been told to me.  A real Michigan Coney Dog has an all-beef casing hot dog grilled to perfection and placed in a steamed bun.  This hot dog is topped with, and this is where it gets the distinction from a chili dog, an all meat chili, onions and mustard.    Since I LOVE to try the most I can in one order... I ordered a "Combo Coney Dog".  This is the Coney dog I described above (I got my onions grilled) with "Loose" meat on top of the hot dog.  What's "loose meat"?  Well, that's just grilled ground beef crumbled up...  They put the loose meat on top of the hot dog and then put the all meat chili on top of that.  Just dang delicious.  I really liked the taste of the hot dog itself.   Not to be out done by the hot dog, the fries here are fantastic.  I litterally watched the chef cut the potato and put the curly fries in the fryer.  The fries are just that fresh.  Oh, by the way, they grind their own meat daily for their hamburgers.  I stopped in Coney Grill to have a Faygo pop and to try the hot dog.  I grew up drinking Faygo pops when I was a kid.  Grape being my favorite flavor.  Detroit Coney Grill has Faygo pops in the bottle.  There is something about the taste of a soda out of a bottle that makes it taste 1000 times better.  I savored every cold, sweet sip.  I like this place.  I'm going back.  I'm taking some of my ex-Detroit family when they come in town.  Yummy.  This place is great!  Get there early, they close a little bit early.

Let me join the Marisa S. and Joe S. bandwagon and say this place is fantastice and yhanks yo Joe and Marisa, I now know about it!  I/we went here on a Wednesday night after the ISC UYE with a few yelpers for their wine tasting quiz.  For $10, you get a blind 4 wine tasting in which you compare your tasting notes to the list  the Wine Warehouse provides and then you make an "educated" guess for each of the wines you are tasting.  I loved it.  What a great idea.  And the best part, if you get all 4 correct, your flight is free.  Ahhhhh, bliss.  I got none correct.  Zero.  Bummer, but I drank wine!   This is a very cute and well stocked wine store and from what I can tell, the staff is very knowledgeable and well trained.  From the serious jazz tunes playing to the short sale wall to the wonderful assortment of tapas and cheese plates, this wine store has all the makings of a fun evening out!  Can you imagine telling your date or friends, lets go to a wine store tonight.  They would be surprised!  My return factor is 100%

Thank Jah for this beautiful weather.  The music has started... DJ on deck... vibes are good....    There were several Bands throughout the day.  I posted a couple pics for the bands I liked.    Pick up Reggae bucks for food.  I suggest pricing your food first, then getting the exact amount in Reggae bucks.   The venue is an open soccer field.  Ladies leave the stilettos at home.  Wedges are cool. Bring an umbrella, there are no trees, there is no shade..  Bring a blanket  Don't be crazy, wear and bring sunblock.     This was the first annual festival.   I was impressed with the way it went for the 1st time around!  I was initially upset that it started 2 hrs late, but I can be forgiving for that.  We sat for nearly an hr in virtual silence.  12-1; 15pm!  If u came on time at 11, uhm, that's 2 hrs. People, DEE JAY - hire one next year!

First,  let me confirm that this establishment has not 1, but 2 restrooms.   One for ladies and one for men.   A fellow Yelper and I exchanged messages about this before I went because that Yelper's review states that Bei does not have a restroom for customers.  It does.   The sign out front is for non-customers.  I snapped a pic of the restroom sign as evidence for others reading reviews and considering this establishment----- because I almost bypassed this restaurant because of that Yelper's information. I hope this helps.  Lately,  I have been into Ramen and brothy soups in general.   Miso, shrimp and pork ramen to be specific.   Take a look at the picture of my Ramen http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bei-scottsdale-2?selected=ovAcABgI3P5BFBUiBYQ9KA#xSczojjTQAVoXmEqcY19yw and view the pic of the Ramen posted by Yelper Britt C.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bei-scottsdale-2?selected=ovAcABgI3P5BFBUiBYQ9KA#Gx2-zZuvY5ynZbUD27BlpA  They look quite different.   Mine had a few tiny pieces of meat, a limited amount of veggies and lacked adequate broth.   I hated it!  I can honestly say the 25 cent pack of ramen I made in college was better!  The veggies tasted canned. I expected a nice piece of pork in the Ramen like the aforementioned picture by Britt C, but there were only a few flavorless tiny pieces. A well known improvisational restaurant, that has monthly ramen nights, down the street has ruined my palate to tolerate ramen any place else.   I can not say how much I hated that dish!     I ordered a spicy sushi roll that I split with a fellow Yelper.  Decent roll.  I would like to try the Bei roll one day.   I went here with the international lunch group that I organize.   Everyone else ordered a bento lunch box.  They were all happy with their lunch and had a consensus 3 star meal.  There were 6 of us,  we were automatically charged a 20% gratuity.   I don't know if this is normal for everyone or if that is the case for groups.   It was not printed on the menu.   It aggravated me,  but alas wasn't a big deal.   They should print that on their menu.  2 stars - I hated my dish.  Because the location is cool for me for easy access to sushi in SoScott, but considering the proximity of other sushi restos that I like better: Return Factor: 15%,   .

SOME People with strollers annoy me!  Sorry.  Ok, that's out the way.     This festival could be more fun if #1 the vendors didn't run out of candy and #2 the lines weren't so long at the vendors/ballons  that had candy.  #3 there were more events/games than bouncy houses!  It is Halloween... Fall... a Festival.... how about games of some sort of skill (potato sack racing, obstacle courses, etc!!!), things you would expect at a Fall Harvest Festival.  We got there at about 5:10, so we did not experience all of the parking issues that others did.  But I can imagine that it was awful considering we waited in line and there were about 15 cars in the area at the time when we were parking.    The KICKER?  1 Adult and 2 kids... $50 spent without any food, w/o any real drinks!    Radio disney was a bright spot.  Wow, the energy of the staff was awesome.  I didn't know that the radio Disney had a local staion on the AM band.  I listen to satellite radio,  but that is good info to know.    Tethered hot air balloon rides were nice.    I'm over this event. Sorry, I tried to like it, but just could not get past the fact that it is advertised as a place to trick or treat BUT the treats were in short supply.  I wouldn't go back to this again.

I stopped in this newer Cornish Pasty with the International Supper Club UYE (#ISCUYE) for February!    This restaurant sits in the shadows of old town, just south of the hussle and bussle around Camelback.    I give this place 4 stars because the pasties are just as yummy and tasty as the orginal, but this building that it is in is just beautiful.  A prefect British pub with these HUGE tables.  this is the perfect place for a large group.  I think our group was about 18 or so and we all sat at one table.  And there aren't just a few large tables, there are a ton of them.  They have this fantastic and beautiful patio.  I can't wait to return and sit out there.

I was debating a 3 or 4 star for this place on my drive home.  I decided this place is certainly over the 3.5 star mark, so 4 star it is.  First, you will find that the Cleaver Koi is on the west side of Central/Lite Rail in a small copper/bronze colored building that has a small breezeway down the middle.  The sign out front is small.  You should turn on/down (don't U turn) Glenrosa St or if you U-turn, be sure to turn into their parking lot at the FIRST left turn (just north of the building) you get to.  If you try that second turn, you will be turning into the wrong parking lot and you will have to circle around on Central and come back again.  Don't ask me how I know this.  But I will say it could be helpful information for those who are not familiar with the area.  Cleaver Koi is a very "neat/cute" space.  I LOVE the ambiance, the look and feel of the restaurant.  It has an atmosphere that is right on par with Central Phoenix, hipster, chic, cool.  I stopped in there today, a Saturday, for lunch. The cleaver Koi has been open about 2 months, so there wasn't a crowd, but the server mentioned that the day before on a Friday, they were completely packed pretty much the entire lunch and dinner service.  So as the masses are finding out about this place, it is filling up like good CenPho restaurants do. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#6MLtRK4fGBKOt9g05P8XFg  My friend and I ordered a variety of things.  Here's my take on a few of memorable things.  My favorite item was the "Pig Face" dumplings!!!  Amazingly delicious and savory with an appropriate level of spice.  Tender dumplings that practically melt in your mouth.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#TwNmKVIhbSWHQgm22KMfQw  We also tried the following notable things: Salt and Pepper Shrimp:  worth having again.  I was pleased with the size and amount of this dish.  I would have had that as an entre.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#QJLxMqO42DMuun5bZzDsoA  Peking Duck Steamed Bun:  Oh man, the duck is very good!   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#uy69wuSn45EnO-Z0sUj88Q  I will definitely come back here for HH when I get the opportunity.  I originally planned to have the roasted pork ramen, but I ended up ordering the Massaman Noodles.  I was satisfied with it, but I ordered it thinking that the noodles would be in a more brothy/soup-like base.  but this dish is certainly a curry (gravy) texture (as the menu stated) and the dish could be eaten with chopsticks.  Oh, they have the cutest crafted cocktail menu... there's one drink "Hey Bartender"... you tell them the spirit and the flavor choice you like... the bartender creates a drink just for you.  It worked twice for us!  Awesome, loved it.

I loved coming here and not just because of the food,  the service was awesome.  The service and the ambiance deserve an extra stand-alone star.  They captured the fwel of a down south restaurant in presence as well as ambiance.  Most places can't get the correct feel/presence.  ANGRY CRAB does! The staff was beyond friendly and accommodating.   The guys working there walked the live crawfish and live lobsters around the dining room for folks to see!  I really found the crawdaddies to be quite Interesting looking creatures!     So I came for a UYE arranged by Arana W here today.   I got there early and held a table for our group.   I was starving so I ordered a pound of crawfish with the Trifecta sauce at #3 spice level.  Half a dz Grilled Oysters and a basket of the calamari.  I nibbled a couple of the calamari and packaged that to go.  I dug into the crawfish and obliterated them!  I also ate all 6 oysters.  I enjoyed everything.  I wished that the grilled oysters were less done and more spiced.   I thought that the trifecta at spicy level 3 was good, but level 3 was barely spicy at all to me.  I was wondering what 4 was like.  There is a seriuos warning on spice level4, so I was afraid to get it, but if you truly like spicy food, I would request 3.5 if I return.    It is difficult to come here and not compare this place to BC or HnJC or other popular "boil" restaurants (I never mention a competitor by name in my reviews).  I like the other new crawfish joint in Tempe just a little better because of their combo sauce.  This is hard becauae the feel, service and ambiance in Angry Crab is like being at home down south.  I danced in the dining room after lunch and knew it would be ok... yes, this was downhome for sure!   My return factor is 100%.  I am bringing my mom when she comes and I will update!

This event was held at La Grand Orange.  This was an easy location to go to for shopping for me.  I go to LGO often enough and love their cookies.  I arrived at 5:30 on the dot.  Yelp had a table setup for "shoppers" who checked-in to pick-up their check-in offer sweet treat - for me, it was the mini-red-velvet cupcake.  I dropped off my cleaning supplies that I purchased for the Ronald McDonald House at the table.  We also received a sweet ticket to get a cup of hot chocolate and an invitation to try out the new restaurant in the LGO family that is located across the street.  I ordered food and sat in the dining room.  I ate dinner and then went back to check out the offerings that LGO has.  I previously wrote a review about LGO.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix#hrid:gx2aCOeK4UAv7h2_jBB3Ag  Besides the food (salads, sammies, desserts), you can get an eclectic variety of games, coffee mugs and various other trinkets in the store.  Here are the links to the pics I took of the things in their store a few months ago.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?filter_by_userid=True&select=XfNKgRbVsXo_6-pb_F0ePw&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA#XfNKgRbVsXo_6-pb_F0ePw  http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3DFO8xOw0Bz_gNA44d2hxw/l.jpg  http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6inoyyD0nrBf9XcU1yjunw/l.jpg  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=YN5Vf1tXbANm1L0etkobQQ#YN5Vf1tXbANm1L0etkobQQ  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=7Ut5X_m74qV9EI7tFzht-Q#7Ut5X_m74qV9EI7tFzht-Q  I enjoy shopping local.  I co-organize a supper club UYE that almost exclusively supports locally owned restaurants and I usually eat at local places.  When I can, I do like to give my business to locally owned farmers and grocers.  Thanks to Lindsey and LGO for the invite to join. I am hopeful that next week's shop local will introduce me to more stores in the Phoenix area that interest me.

I'm not sure why folks rate this store so poorly.  I came here to swap out some equipment.  I was in and out in about 10 minutes, if that.  My name was placed on a list by a friendly gentleman who met me at the door.  Then, a gentleman called my name, swapped out my damaged equipment and then he escorted me to the door and opened the door for me and sent me on my merry way.  My experience in this store was pleasant.

Where's that darn bandwagon?  Oh, there it is.... wait wait... hold on, wait for me!  I am getting on it!... slow that wagon down so I can jump right on it... ok.. there. I'm on it.. I'm taking a seat... whoopie... I'm enjoying the ride.  There is not much more I can add to the mountain of 5-star reviews.  This is THE best BBQ in Phoenix.  It just is.  I knew this from first taste.  The owner's dad confirmed it when he told me about how many awards they have won in BBQ competitions.   FYI:  #1 LMB posts on their Facebook page when they've sold out.  You can also call to see if they are sold out before you come.  This place cooks the meat for 12 hours!  This is not something you can decide to cook at 9am and it be ready at 2pm.  Call them.  They are so nice when you call on the phone.  They understand, you want BBQ... they want to sell BBQ to you and they want you to be happy.  CALL!  Check Facebook,.... I have done these things.  #2. I want to point out that ribs that are cooked properly DO NOT FALL off the bone.  They will pull off cleanly, but won't fall off.   Trust me on this.  I love the fact that ALL of their meat is served dry and without sauce.  Their sauces are delicious.  Add your sauce if you like it, but if you don't like sauce, like me, then you can enjoy flavorful meat and not have to complain about a sauced meat (which is usually using sauce to cover up a lack of flavor in the dry meat).  I may be misquoting the owner on this, but they intend to specialize in absolutely delicious generic BBQ - meaning..... you can eat it with or without sauce and still enjoy.    #3. I have tried EVERYTHING they cook here.  My top 3 favorites are. Fatty Brisket Sausage Pulled Pork Lean Brisket Beef Rib (more like a Flintstone sized piece of meat.  You get this on Fri/Sat ONLY)  Sorry LMB, my dad still makes the absolute best BBQ pork ribs I've had in my life.  But LMB makes the best brisket I've ever tasted.  Ok, So that was five.  But you get the point.  Go here... EARLY.  There will likely be a line.  Be prepared.  Enjoy.

I'm kicking them down to a 4.5 for this recent visit.  I would normally drop a 4.5 to a 4 star review, but all of my prior experiences have been 5 Star, so I will leave them at 5 Star this time.   Strategically, I went here the Saturday before Thanksgiving because I'd hoped that the link would not be as long as I've heard it has grown.  I arrived at 10:20 (I was 4th in line) and I was back in my car by 11:15.  Great for me.  My plan actually paid off!  Even at 11, the line was not very long at all.  Funny thing happened that I must share.  While waiting in line, a cab pulls up about 10:40, out hops 2 ladies with their suitcases.  They were on their way to the airport, but wanted to stop by to have this food and maybe take some with them.  HA!  For some folks this is really good BBQ.  For Phoenix, this is definitely the best you can get.  Please check my previous review WRT to my favorites here and my thoughts about this restaurant.  None of that has changed.    As for my most recent visit, I was somewhat disappointed with the depth of the taste of the meat.  It lacked the seasoned flavor I'd grown accustomed to having!  On this visit I ordered:  Pork Ribs (not nearly as flavorful as they were on my last visit) Brisket (Somewhat not as flavorful, but still the best) Beef Rib (Still very good) Sausage (Still very good)  I was somewhat taken aback by the lack of flavor in the ribs.  Albeit, in the past I have stated that I think my dad cooks the best smoke ribs of any place I've ever had BBQ.    I found it interesting to compare how the prices have not changed much in past 17 months.

For the folks that don't consider this a cocktail parlor,  I really would like to know what you think one is...   I enjoy coming here.   The offering of Vodka is nice.   (some)  People think all vodkas are created equal....  Uhm,  no.   They aren't.   I have enjoyed sampling the potatoe vodkas and other things on the drink menu.   A friend of mine is hooked and he always suggests BT when we want to meet up for drinks.   This place is aesthetically pleasing.   I have to take off a star because I am not impressed with the food choices.   I really enjoyed the ramen burger,  but that's it as far as food is concerned.   I have tried several other things that I didn't like.   I didn't like the smashed chips at all.   :-(  something odd about the spices used on them.   I had an outing with about 10 ladies,  when BT was suggested by someone in the group,  I suggested we stay away because the food offering is really for folks with wide palates and smaller tummies.   I haven't had a problem getting in to this place,  except when I stopped by last Monday.   I was pissed!   How dare they lock the doors on the day they are closed.   ;-)   I love the Yelped board,  I do hope I do not make it though.  If I do,  please let me know so I can come in for a drink and document the occasion.

While the Phoenix Open was getting rained out, this was a convenient location to go and hit a few golf balls.  I had a great time.  I had a bloody Mary, that was fantastic, to get the day started.    You should visit their website for details, but they charge by the hour.  And depending on the time of day, the price per hour increases as the day progresses.  We went in the morning at the $25 an hour rate.    There are a variety of different games one can play.    The food was surprisingly good.  My only issue with this place is the lack of "scalable" fun.  How about small kids?  I know a gang of pre schoolers would love to play golf there, but they probably would never get a ball in a target.  Docking TG a star for that .

Beautiful views and a wonderful spa experience.     There is a very private area for female guests to lounge.  This area is right off the hot tub room.   A perfect place to sun privately.   I walked out there and allowed the cool air and dry heat to dry me off after showering.   It has the perfect elevated view of Camelback mountain too.   During any season,  if a spot next to the spa pool is what you want,  arrive early.   Schedule your services fairly early in the day so you are at the  pool by 11.  The service at the spa pool is nicer,  in my opinion,  than the Jack Rabbit pool.   Sorry.   It may be the size,  Jackrabbit is considerably larger than the Spa pool area.   The spa food is delicious.   On my last visit,  I had the strawberry fields salad.  In general,  I think the resort could benefit from more creative and exciting crafted cocktails.   However,  perhaps not.   This resort as a whole is doing everything right to me.    This spa could be more inviting by dimming the lights a little in the common areas such as the dressing room,  the treatment waiting area,  the hot tub.... .   It is very bright in there.   That bright light doesn't make me feel relaxed.   Maybe a yellowed light?   I'm not sure,  but I like toned down lighting in the areas with the hot tub and the treatment waiting room.   I think that the spa was fairly full this last trip.   So the quiet common  areas were not very quiet.   Small issues and thus the 4 star.   Return Factor 85%.

This Southern girl was good and satistifed when she left Hot and Juicy Crawfish!    When I saw this restaurant flash on the Yelp front page,  I thought I would give it a try eventually.  As I looked over their website, I realized, this is the same resto/company that I have had on my Vegas bookmarks for years.  The second I realized that, I bumped up my visit to "today".    Going on a weekday at 4:30p has its bonuses - parking on Mill is much easier and Mill is not as crowded. So, I park and walk toward the restaurant.  The one thing I want to warn the Yelp community about is that the address says 740 S Mill Ave, the restaurant is actually facing 7th street and is west of Mill Ave (west/around the corner from Mellow Mushroom).    So I went alone as this was decided an hour before I arrived.  I am so disappointed that you can't order a combo boil.  So I made up one.  I ordered 1lb of crawfish with the Hot and Juicy sauce served Spicy Hot.  I also ordered a half pound of shrimp (the only thing that can be ordered by the half lb) with the Lousiana Style sauce served Spicy Hot with sausage and a corn.  Each order comes in a plastic bag with enough seasoning to cover, but not drawn your crustaceans.   I couldn't eat it all, so I saved the shrimp order and ate the crawdaddies.  In general, if you like southern food that is spicy and full of flavors, my advice is to completely bypass the any other sauce option and go straight to the Hot and Juicy - trust me on this. (Order a different flavor as a side, thank me later)  So, I pull my first crawfish tail off and put that head to my mouth and sucked the head and out flowed the the hottest and juiciest crawfish deliciousness I had ever had in my life.  Sucking dem heads and pulling dem tails is how you eat crawfish.  But what I LOVED about these crawfish the most is how juicy they were!  So much seasoning and juice flows into your mouth out of those heads!  And the tails were tender and not overcooked.  So many places muck up crawfish by overcooking them!  They were also so tender and just right because they had not been frozen.  Yes, fresh, ALIVE when they cook them fresh!  Someone help me, I could have slapped someone it was so good!  I have eaten crawfish my entire life and I am pretty sure these were definitely seasoned the best because the Hot and Juicy sauce is so much thicker than the typical crawfish boil juice.  So the flavor just coats your mouth really good.  Thats it folks.  Get yo' self on over there and enjoy it.  Get over there, roll up your sleeves,  put on a bib (very important!) and get a beer! For Pete's sake, don't look like an amateur and wear the gloves they offer!  And always  remember to Suck dem Heads and Pull dem tails.

This visit - 2 Stars.  The quality of the crawfish I ate last night was terrible.  I do not think I will return to this place after last night's experience.  I brought a family member to try this place out and she barely ate the crawfish because she felt like they were frozen and tasted horrible.    I inquired about the crawfish because they were not good.  When I came in April, they were fantastic,  they were delicious, they were Hot and Juicy.  I wanted to know where they came from.   I was told Lousiana.  I asked if those were live when they cooked them... I was told Yes.  Here are a few more questions I asked the manager.  1.  Do you sell crawfish year round?  ANSWER: Yes. 2.  When out of season, do you get them live?    Answer: Yes. 3.  Wow, where do you get them from?  ANSWER: From Lousiana.  They have farms that grow them in the off-season.  Me...  dumbfounded.    I have lived in the deep south a good portion of my life, eaten crawfish since I was old enough to pinch tails by myself and never... not ever have I had crawfish in the off-season.  Places that sell crawfish in season stop selling them in the off-season... because it's the off season!  HNJ has an interesting distributor that has resources and access to things I've never heard of in my matriculation in LA.   We also ordered a shrimp basket.  Excellent fries, but cornmeal battered shrimp?  if you are going to do that, please make sure the corn meal batter is the best on the planet because cornmeal on shrimp is unusual and is not so great.  Did someone in the kitchen forget the recipe?  I don't know.  1-star for the good fries and the attentive service.  Return Factor: 5%.

Walking in here made me feel like I was having an "Oprah Winfrey" moment.  Not the "Ah-ha" moment that we know her to have.... Not even a "I feel like buying every shoe in here because I am a billionaire" moment.....     I was having an "Oprah Winfrey" moment as I walked in this Designer Shoe Warehouse because I felt like screaming at the top of my lungs........ "You get a pair.  YOU get a pair.  And You get a pair!  EVERYBODY. GETS. A. PAIR!"    What a crazy and exhilarating high I get from walking in a store that has waist high displays of shoes everywhere.  Rows upon rows of shoes, no, not just shoes..... discounted shoes!    As Wilma and Betty (Flintstones) once said, and is now the battle cry of every shoe-loving woman in America ................. "CHARRRRRRRRGE!"  Kids, elderly, men and women, out of my way as I charge for the back of this store for the shoes that are marked down even more. Yes, I head straight and I mean do not pass GO, to the clearance section!   As I am heading back there, I scan the area for my size.  Once I spot my size I almost, no---- I gleefully skip to my section.  I almost always find a pair of shoes that I like.  When I find a pair of shoes in that clearance section, I feel like I have won a battle!  Mission accomplished.  Once I have taken a look at the clearance section, I start making my way to the checkout counter.  But as I do, I peruse the isles of shoes that are not on clearance.  I check out sandals and boots usually.  DSW has all kinds of shoes by many different brands.  Like many shoe stores now, DSW carries many different types of accessories from Jewelry to Purses.  I have won many a battle on a DSW showroom floor.  I was in this one today.. I went, I shopped, I conquered.  Put that on repeat!

How awesome was it to score an invitation to the Hotter than Hell Bonspiel.  It was close to being as hot as hell outside, but inside the Coyote Curling Club, it was as cold as ice.    The curling club is located in a fairly industrial section of Tempe, just off the R143 between the I10 and the 202.  It is pretty easy to find, just look for the triangular flags flying at the entrance.    I have always been curious about curling. When I heard there was a curling club (in the desert no less) and they had a bonspiel this weekend, I was excited to attend.  I dropped in for one of the final rounds in the bonspiel.  I walked in and immediately felt comfortable and at home.  A lady named Kelly was sitting at the first table.  I asked her if I needed to pay anything and that opened the door to her explaining EVERYTHING about the game to me.  I learned so much about the game of play as well as strategy for winning.  I would ask questions, and Kelly or whoever was sitting in the vicinity would jump in and discuss the game with me.  I know people make fun of curling, but it is fascinating to me.    The curling sheet is contained in its own room with 4 areas for game play.  During my visit, there were 4 games going on at once.  I could observe the games from the viewing studio.  I observed different styles of play.  Some teams like to play draws (ie land in the house) and some teams like to play knockout (knock the other team's stones out of the house).    In the viewing studio, they have nice comfortable couches to rest on or you can sit at bistro style tables.  They also have bird's eye view cameras of each house (ring/targets).  The club seems to be working on getting a snack bar off the ground.  When I went, it looked like all the snacks were free. This is a great place to go this summer to just watch a game or practice game and learn about the game of Curling.     If you are interested, check out their website to see what the schedule is like and drop in.  There is no admission fee.

THIS PLACE!  I hate to even write a review because I want it all to myself.  I refuse to give any details.  Ok.. .Ok... There is a lot of smoke and ash and cigars and blue flames.  Ok, that's all you get.  I rate it 5 stars.  that's all I'm saying.  Good bye.

I'm only holding off giving a 5 star review until I return to have other things on the menu. When thinking of ways to describe my experience... A Dream... Delicious... Memorable... I'm so into this place.  First of all, it is absolutely adorable, buuut, Not pretentious, yet sumptuous and splendid.  I walk in and order right away.  I saw the pics of the Shrimp and Grit Cake and I was anxious to try that.  I was also interested in the Cucumber Gimlet...  both items were 5 star experiences for me.  When I got the shrimp and grit cake, I thought, "I think I need a spoon for all this gravy."  but I soon discovered, as you cut away from the grit cake, it actually soaks up all of that gravy --- NO spoon needed.  This may be one of the best tasting and the most aesthetically pleasing Shrimp and Grits I've ever had.  It was perfect.  From the grit cake gradually soaking up the gravy to the nicely spiced and suitable seasoning to the appropriately cooked shrimp... Every. Thing. About. This. Dish. Is. Perfect.  Then the cucumber gimlet... simply perfection in a glass.  I'm enjoying the old and new EXCELLENT gastro pubs around Phoenix.  Ten is proving to be a 10, indeed.  I plan to return soon.  I know my 4 Star will go to a 5 star.  Can't wait.

Cute Shop?  Check. Taste Great?  Check Moist Decedent Red Velvet Cake?  Priceless.  This girl loves A Bakeshop.  This place is simply adorable and aesthetically perfect.  I would love to have a girl tea party in this gorgeous bake shop.    I was fortunate enough to receive this cake as a gift from a friend who lives out of state.  Good deal, this bake shop allowed him to place the order of the phone and I picked it up when it was ready.  I am not a desserts person.  I've never been one to eat cake and cookies.  I put my fat-calories in salty foods like chips, hot wings, and French fries.  So, when it comes to cake, I usually eat the icing off the cake and then I toss the cake away.  I had a very different experience with this cake.  I tried to a full proper bite of this chocolate cake with a layer of strawberries in the middle and I was surprised to find it extremely moist.  I should have known that a cake that heavy would be packed with delicious moistness.  Ok, they have the moist factor down.  The cake itself tasted extremely delicious.  It didn't have that weird boxed chocolate taste.  It tasted very chocolate-y, without being over-bearing with the flavor.    The best part of the cake, the icing, was a buttercream that was light and non-greasy and absolutely delicious.  It wasn't overly sweet, simply "Just Right".  I also picked up a Red Velvet Cupcake... the still fell short of that taste I look for in a RVC.  Thus, 4 stars (I reserve the 5 star bakery reviews for the bakeries with the best RVCs).  This cake was extremely moist, with the absolute right approach to the taste.  The texture was perfect. The small morsels of chocolate were surprising and a nice touch.  The cream cheese frosting was perfectly done.  Although the taste was good, it lacked the taste I grew up with.  I need to try it again.  This could be a 5 star bakery.  I need a repeat.  :-)  I still think TCC has the best RVC in Phoenix.    Return Factor: 90%

One of my favorite wing spots just opened near my favorite library.   I am always in need of a great and awesome location to pick up food when I am headed to the library to read/study.   This place just happens to be my all time favorite.   Brand spanking new with my favorite lemon pepper wings and hand cut fries.   Order online or with the app.   Could life be any better?   I think not.

I bumped this review up to 5 stars because AC is your best bet for the Southern flavored seafood boils.   Plus,  their menu has tasty options beyond the boils that don't seem like after-thoughts ie - "Oh yeah,  let's put something else on the menu besides seafood boils".   Nice because boils can be a little messy.   It is no secret,  I love the little dirt Devils known to most as crawfish,  some know them as crayfish and others crawdads.   For the past 2 years,  I have had the pleasure of going between AC and HnJC for my crawfish.   Crawfish are in season from early in the year until about MID-SUMMER.  They are best,  to me, between April and late June.  The window is small considering the fact that I can eat snow crab all year long.   OK,  with that in mind,  it is mid-June and I have been to both places 3 times each since April.   I have come to the conclusion that Angry Crab is the best and most consistently good establishment in Phoenix for Southern flavored seafood boils.   Every time I have gone over the past 2 years,  I have received a consistently flavorful and fresh batch of crawfish.   I order the Trifecta-hot.   There is always an adequate amount of seasoning and the seasoning has consistently tasted good and the same.  I normally add half an order of sausage and corn to go in my boil.  I Took a visiting family member their this week and she said her crab boil was the best flavored she has had in quite some time.   The nice part about AC is the "extra"  stuff on the menu is equally as good.   Po' boy sandwiches,  char-grilled oysters (oooh lala,  delicous)  and the oyster shooter is to die for!   They also have the yummiest seasoned fries.   If you like oysters or if you like escargot, I highly recommend that you order the char-grilled oysters.  They are delicious!  You won't regret it.  Send me a compliment if you read my review and order them!  I'll just reply back, "I told you so!"    BTW: They do have BBQ.  If you read through my reviews, I only do BBQ at one establishment in PHoenix.  Their oysters are good on the barbie.  I have no clue about the other meats.  Kid Factor 7/10 My Return Factor: 100%.

This is a review that has been in the making for quite some time.  This review is for the THIS location.  This is a 3.5 Star review, but I can't give them a 3.  I will cut to the chase and save most of my comments for the Phoenix/Original location.  LoLo's is down right good chicken and great waffles.  This location seems to not be as busy as the flagship location in downtown.  But, please don't think that means that this location is not busy.  At lunch time, if you arrive before noon or after 1:30, you will stand your best chance to be seated right away.  On the weekends, fa'git about it, you'll wait.  its worth it.   I order the exact same thing Every time I go.  I rarely change my order.  I order a Tre Tre with blue koolaid.  On a couple of occasions, I was feeling snazzy, so I ordered the Toy Toy.  The Tre  Tre is similar to the Toy Toy.  Both have 2 pieces of chicken and a waffle.  Tre Tre - Drumsticks.  Toy Toy - Wings.  The chicken is hot and crispy.  I have had it a time or two and thought that perhaps it had been cooked and sitting in a warmer too long.  The waffles are extremely good.  I enjoy putting a little of the butter and a lot of the syrup on mine and eating my waffle from the inside out!  YUMMY!   I haven't had much else on the menu, but I've sampled the plates of folks I've been with and their food was good.  I was in there a couple of weeks ago and I see that they have added several new items to the menu.  I want to try the shrimp and grits.  I was reading another Yelper's (Tigra C) review and realized, the only vegetable that I've ever tried at LoLo's is the fried green tomatoes and the fried pickles... oh and the french fries. I'm pretty sure that those 3 things do not constitute vegetables anymore.  LOL welp, I will consider the spinach the next time.  The thing about this location that I like is that the service is always friendly and prompt.  This is the only place in Phoenix for chicken and waffles.  I love being waited on by a couple of guys that work there.  they are twins.  Mr C and Mr D (if I recall correctly).  Those are some nice fellas.  I have tried their Red Velvet Cake and I was somewhat surprised to find that it was a decent contender for what I would call a good Red Velvet Cake.  It doesn't rival my 1st and 2nd favorite RVC's in phoenix.  The texture of this cake is exactly moist enough and the cream cheese icing tastes creamy and sweet.  The one thing their RVC is missing is the taste of the cake.  The hint of the chocolate is not there.  I DO NOT like the raw nuts on the cake, but I can eat around that.    All in all, LoLo's is the "only" spot to get  chicken and waffles in Phoenix.

Another well done Jazz festival.  Since moving to the AZ grand,  many of the issues that were associated with the festival are resolved by moving from a primarily residential area to one in which the audio can be directed right at the noisy freeway.  The prices keep going up. I sat about 12 rows from the stage just outside of the Golden circle,  right in the middle,  and those seats were pretty pricey.   Just to give you an idea,  the 1st time I went to the AZ fest in 2012, I spent less on my 3 night  tkts and 2nights at the Wigwam than I spent on the 3 night tkts and no room at the AZ Grand.   I think the prices may be comparable to Essence music festival,  but it is not on the Essence level!     For AZ,  this is a great music fest for jazz and soul music lovers.... ,  that gets no press like other music events.  *shoulder shrug*

On the most unassuming, industrial street intersection sits the most interesting restaurant in Phoenix.  Why so?  Well, where else can you get crispy fried chicken, donuts and ramen?  Where else might you find a restaurant with that type of variety... I'll wait...   Buhler?    Don't go here thinking you'll have Southern Fried chicken that is usually heavier flour and more seasoned.  This chicken is Korean Fried, which means it is "twice fried" with a very light batter that is almost tempura-like, but not quiet.  The chicken is served with (or tossed in) Asian inspired sauces.  I ordered a 2 piece chicken with the Korean Chili.  Since I got the combo, I could have a salad and donut with it.  I opted for a Sprinkle donut.  I also had a the very good cucumber salad.

So, Gallo Blanco, the popular restaurant that opened a few years ago and was debuted in the cover of Phoenix magazine during their 25 Best new restaurants, stopped operating in the Clarendon Hotel.  However, a modern Mexican restaurant does operate in its place and is doing a very fine job.  I have stopped in here for drinks and come for a couple meals since GB closed.  My favorite thing on that menu has to be the other-worldly delicious flapjacks!  Oh my word.  I never would have expected this at this establishment.  Those things taste better than any pancake I have ever had in my life.  And bonus... breakfast is served all day at this restaurant.    The tacos are good too.  I love the SOBE boutique feel of the hotel.    I had a few custom crafted cocktails and the bartenders did a pretty good job with my list of favorite ingredients.   Return Factor:95%

Now hear this... Now hear this... "Heaven is a place on Earth."  "Heaven is a Wonderful Place" full of fried potatoes with an interesting name like, Poutine, Putin or pootin, depending on what happens in the gastrointestinal area.. but never mind that... lets get back to this "Postcard from Heaven" review because reading this puts you "Just A Step From Heaven".    I stopped in here one glutinous evening and took the "Stairway to Heaven".  I ordered the buffalo wings and loaded fries.  It was like experiencing "Heaven Tonight" right there in my mouth.  The salty goodness of a french fry, topped with the vinegar and heat of the buffalo sauced chicken.  The beauty of this is that there can be "Heaven for Everybody"  "As Heaven is Wide" and plentiful right there on the campus of ASU.  You will find a plethora of toppings for your fries like hot wings sauce, gravy, blue cheese and sour cream.  When you go, don't expect to have a leisurely dinner or lunch.  This is a place that is stop and go.  Seating is limited.    Ladies and Gentlemen of Yelp, "I Found Heaven" and I intend to keep "Knocking on Heaven's" door every time I need a french fry fix.

This place has the makings of a 5-star favorite.  Happy Hour is Everyday 4-6pm Weedays, but you get an extra Hour on Sat/Sun when the hours are 3-6pm... All of their Southern Cocktails are on HH.  Most of the small plates are, Beers and wines... and I think the prices are pretty decent too.   I stopped in on a Saturday around 5:30 after reading Taric's review.  And yes, this place is everything the folks are saying about it and more.  I already know that I'm going back.  I want to try a few more things on the menu.  So far,  I've had the chicken skins..  Honestly absolutely delightfully tasty... The crispy skin and the sweet and spicy drizzled honey sauce pairs well with their Okra Hot sauce.  (just be careful pouring the sauce out of that bottle... it has a wide mouth and you'll have a plate full of sauce)  I also ordered the Tennessee style fried chicken.  A leg and a thigh.  I was not quite a impressed with this as I was the chicken skins.  The chicken wasn't seasoned well enough and to me, Tennessee hot style chicken (like Gus') is not wet, its actually dry.  Nevertheless, the chicken was still very tasty and I would have it again, but request the sauce on the side.  No time soon, there are things on that menu that I must try...Here's a todo list: Chicken Skins: 5/5 Tennessee Fried Chicken: 3/5 Beef brasato: 5/5  Pork Belly Bites and Greens Pimento Cheese Burger Hamhock and blackeyed peas Bonemarro biscuits and stuff potlickker mussels Oysters al forno....

Great, awesome and LOVEs IT.  Ordering from here reminded me of a Chipotle or Subway.... you roll up and state the size "bowl" you want.  I took the regular size bowl that comes with 2 scoops of fish.  (The large with 3).  YOu have the option to take white rice, brown rice or half and half.  I did .75 and .25.  I don't eat that much rice.  A scoop of Ahi tuna and a scoop of Tuna Luna....  There are 4 different sauces that they can mix your fish with.  Me.. I go for the spicy house sauce.  yumms.. not too spicy at all.  A bit heavy on the sesame oil on my second trip, but still tasty.  then there are about 9 different toppings that you can add on... Me... ALL of them please.  Oh boy talk about deliciousness!  I returned on the grand opening.  The line was long.  Everything was half price.  :-)  Return Factor: 100%  Taking my coworkers here for lunch.
