Moved from Houston to North Scottsdale.  Terrified by the reviews of dry cleaners there.  Stories of shoddy service and over pricing.  I contemplated shipping my clothing back to Houston.  But thanks to Yelp I've found a perfect option. Great job and everything (almost) is $2.50!!

A few things:   1.  I have a low tolerance for pain.   2.  When in pain I want empathy AND a science based approach to a remedy   3.  I want to be heard.  I want a clinician who makes me feel comfortable, asks meaningful questions and sincerely listens.     I got all of this ...and more ...with Dr. M and her staff.  On the mend and so grateful!!

Wonderful little cafe.  Great food, excellent service and in a perfect location.   I had the omelet which was divine...it comes with wonderful breakfast potatoes and I opted for the biscuit which was good ...not my momma's , but definitely one of the best "restaurant" biscuits ever.

I was a little apprehensive given the overall average rating was only 3ish stars ...but my fridge was adamant about attending their Halloween Bash and the concierge says the best option would be to do dinner then club ...  All that said, my concerns were unfounded.  The food was divine!!  We started with the Lobster Spring Rolls which were delish ...the Sea Bass truly is one of the best things I've ever eaten (apparently that's their sig dish) but the shut yo minute dish was the Coconut Shrimp.  Huge shrimp in this crispy coconut coating was beyond yummy ...  We finished with the Fortune Cookie which is much much more than a cookie!!   Full and a wee bit tipsy we went through the gyrations to get into the club (why so many stamps and check points??)   Party if was!!! Really amazing costumes. Great music. A place to stand or Dance.  Best of five clubs we visited!

Once again, Yelp did not disappoint.  My brother ~ who lived in San Antonio ~ and is addicted to good Mexican Food came to visit.  With the pressure of finding a great place, I turned to Yelp.  Excellent selection!!! So many yummy salsas and the Tacos were quite good.  Not as amazing as Barrio Queen but definitely yummy.  The Margaritas were beyond divine tho ...as was the fried Quesadilla and I am not s fan of rice and beans, but these were exceptional.

I'm afraid I have echo those who say the patient care is deplorable.  I am insured with Blue Cross.  I DO NOT HAVE MEDICARE.  Yet, they wanted me to sign a form, re Medicare Payment.  I asked why this was relevant and asked for an explanation.  The desk clerk was sooooo rude.   She said I had to sign the document.   When I pushed... They refused to see me?!

Was hugely apprehensive about finding a new nail salon ~ I wear my nails long and with gel or whatever.  Thus with each move ...Chicago to Houston and now Scottsdale I've had issues finding the right salon.   Yay!  This is it.  Great energy.  Exceptional service snd Kelli did a fab job on my nails.  Perfect.

My review is not in reference to the staff ~ the young woman I spoke to was lovely.  Nor is it in reference to the inventory.  My issue is with the return policy of SEVEN DAYS.   Our "interior designer" purchased a rather pricey (yet not so cute) mirror ...I assumed I could exchange for something more our taste.   Only to learn that their return policy is within 7 days. So now I'm stuck with a rather icky mirror that I'm not sure I can give away!  That's $175 lost ...and yet another reading I'm not a fan of this "designer"

Yikes.  So wanted to love this place since everyone was super nice.  But alas the end results were not thrilling.    Pedicure: tech trimmed my nails big two are "crooked" ...  Nails:  one broke ...I have acrylics and rarely break them.  But within 24 hours, the nail cracked like  glass ...then broke.  She also failed to glue my nails to the "tip" to minimize separation and the likelihood of water getting between my natural nail and the tip.

If only for the Sea Bass and Frisse Salad. The decor was ok.  Quintessential "French" ambiance ...sorta.  But the food was divine.  A huge huge Frisse salad with just enough tang in the dressing, lots of flavor, perfect egg.   Enough to share and the Sea Bass was a large and beautifully prepared piece of fish that was fresh, flavorful...yummy.   I'm definitely a fan!!

...am super picky about my appearance and while it's important for my hair to look fab, it's even more important for it to be healthy.    I often find some stylists will sacrifice one for the other, but not Janair.  Although I wear a weave (gasp) Janair spends as much if not more time on my "natural" hair...resulting in an incredible mane   I also like that she's innovative and constantly looking for ways to provide a robust array of services...from making my eyebrows glam to ensuring my grey hair isn't so grey ...  Cannot compliment her enough.

...I've long admired the design elements of their furniture, and I've purchased a few pieces (about 10 years ago) from the store in Cincinnati , and had a great experience.   Consequently, when my guy bought a new home in Scottsdale and asked for help decorating, one of our first stops was the store in Houston   We met with a "designer" and discussed our design styles (which she seemed to get) and left her the house floor plans so she could create a proposal.   We returned and she had some good ideas and despite MY concerns about the sectional, assured us it would fit.   My issues:   The sectional DID NOT fit.  She ordered the wrong configuration.   The furniture arrived months (we were told 8 weeks.  It was closer to 12) later than promised, but after our purchase of nearly $26k worth of furniture, we received no follow up from the designer, sales person etc.   We later learned the designer quit, so we began working with the manager (who did her best) ...  Overall, this has been a rather disappointing experience ...and quite honestly, I'm not sure the quality warrants the price.   I fear they've grown too fast ...
