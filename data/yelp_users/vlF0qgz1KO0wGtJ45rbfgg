There are quite a few Thai restaurants to choose from in downtown Tempe, but this is my favorite. They have the best Pad Thai and a fantastic Red Curry. The employees are always super nice and greet me with a smile when I pick up my order.

I always try to hit up the most popular veg restaurants whenever I travel, but nothing compares to the food and atmosphere at Green. I'm so happy that the best veg restaurant on earth is in my own city. The Big Wac, Wendy's Pickle and Blackjack Pita are a few of my favorites, but everything on the menu is pretty delicious. And don't forget to grab a treat next door at Nami after your meal!

The manager here was very unfriendly and needs a refresher on AZ law. He wouldn't let my out-of-state friends in with me because they had vertical IDs, even though they were still valid and acceptable forms of ID. This law was changed back in April and when I showed him the updated identification requirements from the AZ liquor board on my phone, he scoffed at me and still wouldn't let them in. Stacy, please educate your employees on the new ID laws and make sure visitors from out-of-state aren't treated like this in the future.
