I met someone here for dinner one night... They have the best Pad See Ue (sp?) that I have ever tasted. They sprinkle fried garlic over it and I love the burst of garlic every time I bite into one. Service was decent and the wait staff was very attentive. We had papaya salad, beef salad, chicken and beef satay and green curry. Everything was delicious. I live in the very northern parts of Phoenix but do not mind the drive. It is worth it.

Best Chinese food in town.... they do salt and pepper EVERYTHING (Chicken, pork chop, shrimp, and squid)!  Not to mention they are quick! You can call them up and no matter how big the order is it will be done in 15 minutes. I always joke about it but it's not a laughing matter when other restaurants have you waiting.

Definitely a fan of this place. It is not too often you find a Thai Buffet yet alone one that serves fairly decent tasting food. This place does both and a really good job of the later. The selection is good here... My favorite is the dish with the fried fish fillet. It always hits the spot. I really like the 2 soups they have. I usually have 1 small bowl of each. The chicken with basil is good also. None of the dishes in the lunch buffet are bad but aside from the ones I mentioned earlier it's just decent. Hence the 4 stars versus 5.  For desert they have mini donuts... they taste like malisadas if your familiar with that.   Wait-staff is nice but I always need to tell them I need extra napkins.

The Baristas Justin and Anthony make my day everytime I go there. They are so cute!!! I love starbucks but the fact that this one has a drive through makes it all the better. I like how they know me by my voice or my order. There is one guy there that creeps me out... He is an older guy with this weird stalker voice.   It does get crowded in the morning though... But they get you in and out fairly quickly. BTW did I mention how ridiculously good looking Justin is? He's the Barista with that wonderful smile.  Can't wait to go there tomorrow morning!!!  My drink of choice: Iced Venti Americano no water lite ice and sometimes I get a splash of soy if I am feeling like being on the crazy side.

Just the thought of this places makes nauseated. I would give no stars if I could. The tandoori chicken on the buffet tastes like the smell of feces. The chicken curry uses cheap cuts of meats. There was so much bone and cartlidge. For a good Indian buffet I would check out Indian Palace next to I17 and Bell.  That place is soooo much better.

Holy Atomic Pile of Sh!t Batman!!!! This stuff sucks.... Like the previous reviewer I got sucked in by the commercials. Plus they were the only ones open at 9:50PM for delivery. Else we would have done Barro's Pizza, which by the way is awesome!  Yes the website makes the process look cool but it is 2010 and I know high school kids with flashplayer skills that can do the same thing.  On to the food review!  We ordered a thin crust cali bacon chicken ranch pizza with mild chicken wings, cheesy bread, and that chocolate crunch cake thingy.   The Pizza and Bread... Tasted like they put tons of salt on it. I was hoping that the additional green peppers, onioins, and mushroom would give it some flavor but I would not  have noticed they were there if I did not order it. The crust was all right but how do you screw up a thin-crust? Let's not hold them to that though...  The cheesy bread was cheesy, crappy, and salty all rolled into one.   The chicken wings were not as cooked as I would have liked which made it even more gross.  There was a lot of skin on them. GROSS GROSS GROSS!!!  I am not sure what kind of sauce they put on it but it looked like watered down ketchup and it just looked plain nasty. It did not look appetizing at all! On a normal day I can throw down a double order of wings with no problem but with this I only ate 2 pieces and said to myself "what a waste of money."   The chocolate crunchy thing tasted okay but it was very sweet. I might be diabetic now because of it.   Next time it's late and no one is open for delivery then I will either starve or get my lazy as up and drive somewhere that is open. Considering In-n-Out and Denny's is right down the street from me I definitely wasted my money.   If you enjoy wasting money on pooh then by all mean go for it.  I would give this place negative stars if I could.

Went here for breakfast... The first thing I noticed was the weird smell from the parking lot. The restaurant is located right off the freeway in an old plaza. The entire building looked old and run down.  The lady waiting my table brought drinks and silverware to the couple sitting a 3 tables down. I did not get the same service. I found that odd.  The food selection was poor. They only eggs they had were scrambled eggs and eggs sunny side up. The bacon tasted very gamey and the pork sausage was dry. Most of the items looked like they had been sitting out for a while.  For less than $8 what can you expect? I would try another home town buffet but would not go to this specific one again.  Also the bathroom was a 4 out of 10 in terms of cleanliness. It smelled and looked liked it had not been cleaned that morning.

This place was recommended by a co-worker when first moved to Phoenix.  At one point I was going there 2 times a week. Food is EXCELLENT considering the prices. It's inexpensive, quick, and delicious. I recommend the ASU Devil Chicken... Their stir fried veggies are good too. I have not had anything that was not good. Their crab puffs are really good. A bit on the sweet side but I am not complaining.

This is L&L... How can you go wrong? If you been to one L&L then you been to them all... It's a franchise, but they do a good job of it.  They do chicken katsu really good here...   I like how they have poke and kim-chee but the poke is a bit over priced and it is loaded with onions... sometimes more onions that fish. Then again you can never put a price on good food.   I really like the Lau Lau from here... It is rare that I can get good Lau Lau unless I am at someone's house and someone's grandmother made it.    I like how they have the atkin's plate for those who are watching carbs... Portions are big so I would think about going with the mini plate and try 2 different things.   The spam musubi is good for what it is... A piece of pan seared spam over rice wrapped up in seaweed... Sometimes I think it is too much rice but it is not like you can't take some of the rice out.

I would like to start this review by saying that I WAS never a real big fan of sweet BBQ sauce. That is more of a cultural thing though. I was just never exposed to it. That said, I was not too excited when co-workers chose this place for dinner one night.  Let me say that this place is sooo good I ended up BUYING BBQ sauce to take home with me. They come in different levels of HOT! My favorite is the Devil's Spit which seems to just get hotter the more you eat.  I have come back here multiple time and I may have possibly tried everything on their menu. I LOVE their ribs... I am a fan of the corn bread and the mashed potatoes are good too. Other things that are good are the brisket and pulled pork.   I wait-staff is attentive and they were really helpful in explaining each sauce. It gets crowded so don't plan on having a quiet evening if you come here.

Service here sucks!  The atmosphere is very pretentious considering this place is pretty much in the middle of the barrio... The seating inside is horrible.... It is one big long table and everyone gets seated next to each other. I was deeply immersed in the conversations of the groups to my left and my right.  The group on my right were going to watch a show after dinner and the group on my left just got back from a trip and they were meeting up with a friend for Vietnam. I made up stories about getting a sex change operation just to mess with everyone because if I heard them then sure as hell heard me.   I went here with my mom after we visited the Botanical Gardens. The outside looks like it could be a local dive bar... When you go in everything is dark... I hated it... The kitchen is open so you see them cooking the food and you can hear all the dishes making noise. The client√®le seemed like they were more middle-upper class but they were all weirdos... It is one thing to watch the Real Housewives of Orange County but you can't pretend to be the Real Housewives of Orange County.  Thank God the sangrias are good. They get 1 star for their sangrias... the other star was for the flavor of the food. It was good... I really like the Paella... They did not get anymore stars because the server got our order wrong and failed to bring us one of the dishes we ordered. Oh and she gave us bread with olive oil... No balsamic vinegar... I had to ask for it... WTF???  Did I mention how she made us feel like we did not belong there... Excuse me miss I work for tips. You messed with the wrong Diva today!!! So I ended tipping her $1.00... on a $90 bill. My mom was embarrassed but I am not running for Mrs. Congeniality so be glad I even left a tip. *Evil Laugh*   Oh and they do not have diet coke... WTF? It is 2010... Doesn't every place have a diet soda.  They said they have Lemon Aid.... Um... Diet Soda is not Lemon Aid. Another WTF moment!  Also one last thing to bag on them about... The waitress told us they had specials but when we read the menu the specials were just the same thing. I even asked if there was something different and she said no. To this day I wonder what made them special if they were part of the regular menu.  BTW this place is all tapas so everything is on little plates. Not sure why people are surprised.  That is a given considering the name of the place. Price was in-line with the quality of the food.... don' get me started on the service though.  I am now taking away 1 of the 2 stars I gave them just because I had to think about the service we got and it still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.   I hope you have a better experience at this place and less "WTF" moments. LOL

This is an amazing space and a great experience each time.   Rates are always a good deal and I like that the local community has access to the pool and spa as well as the restaurant. The last time I visited the hotel was for ARTel which was a amazing and I look forward to going back for that show. This is a great little boutique hotel that caters to both the locals and visitors alike.

The best Korean food I have tasted since moving to AZ. It took a while to find one that I actually like. Their spicy squid remind me of the restaurant I went to as a kid. Their jap chae is good but a little sweet which I am not used too. I still order it though. I have had their hot pots (Dolsot Bibim Bap)  and they are all good... the bulgolgi and kalbe are good as well. My mom orders the broiled milk fish and she loves it. They have a great selection of kim-chee and give you more if you want some. I am always asking for this seasoned seaweed and seasoned fish cake.  The staff is good and always attentive. We go here soooo much that they know us.   They also serve sushi and sashimi. I order the Sashimi if I am really feeling hungry. The cuts of meet taste fairly fresh.... I am picky about my fish especially since the closet ocean is a couple hundred miles away. This place does a good job of it. The sushi rolls are decent. Nothing spectacular.... Their smaller than what I am used to but then again I come here for their Korean food not the Japanese food.   All in all the best Korean Restaurant I have been to since moving to the valley.

This is the only place I go to watch movies now.... They have a full bar, the food menu is extensive for a movie theater. Drinks are pretty good and you even get a glow stick in some of the specialty cocktails. Servers have always been helpful without being pushy. Appetizer sampler is a good starter... Don't forget you can also get candy and popcorn like a regular movie concession. BTW the order of regular popcorn is HUGE-GANTIC!!! Parmesan Fries are also good and the portion is huge! Don't forget the full bar!! You can meet up before the movies and get a little toasted! Hahaha  Try to get a theater that has the touch button recliners. They are so comfortable... It makes it feel like you're watching a movie in bed. Don't forget to validate your parking.

Not a big burger fan but this place is close to my work and I just needed to pick up something real quick one day so decided to check it out. I must say I was pretty impressed. The steak burgers are sooo tasty and they look homemade not your typical commercial patty. I went back and took a chance with the hot dog and it was good too. I love the grilled onion they put on it.  I am not big on sweets but decided to try their frozen custard one time and I must say it was pretty damn good. Better than any ice cream I have ever tasted. I like the texture and consistency... It is very creamy and not too sweet.  Oh and their fries... Can't get enough of them... I get them extra crispy and the seasoning they use it awesome. It's not just salt...  Definitely a good place if you need a burger fix. I always use the drive through but the service is decent. Nothing special for a drive through. They have never got my order wrong.

I am not big on Pizza but this place is definitely a winner!!!! The best Pizza place in Anthem!!!  I love the selection and the food tastes oh so fresh. From the pizza to the ravioli. The pizza is good, the pasta is good, the bread is good, and the chicken wings are also... you guessed it. GOOD!  Their delivery is quick and the people are nice. Prices are good for the quality of the food you get and I'd rather spend money at Barro's than waste it on Pizza Hut or Dominos any day.  Their meat pizza is really good and the italian sausage they put on the pizza sare these huge chunks of italian yumminess.  The chicken pizza is good too and I love how much green peppers and onions they put on it. It gives it a crunch and makes it taste very fresh.   Chicken wings have good flavor and HOT means hot... I even like the honey hot flavor which is not something I usually get.   The spagehtti comes with this giant meat ball that is cut in half. The meat tastes soooo good. Like it is home made. Ravioli has good flavor too but I am not a big pasta fan so I usually eat the meat ball and  move onto the pizza or wings.  The garlic bread that comes with the pizza.... SOOO GOOD! We always order extra because I will not share... hahahaha

This place has the best tandoori chicken that I have ever tasted. It is so flavorful... They also have tandoori spicy chicken wings that I recommend. I have never had problems with their service like some of the other reviewers. Some might think it is a bit pricey but my motto is that you can't put a price on good food.  I love their garlic naan. Their chicken saag is also very good. Everything I have ordered here  has either met or exceeded my expectation. The menu is ala cart so if you want rice then you need to order it on the side but they give you a lot.

This is THE ONLY dim sum place I found in PHX. In Orange County I had no problem finding a good dim sum place but in Phoenix, this is as good as it gets.  Hence the 5 stars....   The food is good and well priced... Dim sum is ordered on a menu. Not rolled around in carts so you miss out on that experience. I definitely recommend the custard filled bun. Anything with Shu Mai is good... I really like the flavor. The sesame seed balls are good too. I love how fresh everything is when they bring it to you.  The dim sum prices are good for the amount you get.  Weekend mornings get crowded so  u better get there early if you have a large party. Wait staff is nice but the English is broken.  Not an issue for me. I do the point and order.

Taking away stars from this place. They no longer serve dim sum daily. They now have a buffet that for the most part is rather bland and the presentation is so unappetizing. At least make it look good enough to eat. Dim sum comes out over cooked as if it was just reheated.

Best Indian lunch buffet I have had while living in AZ. Dishes are flavorful , staff is very attentive. Their Nan is sooooo fresh. I try to come her once a week for my Indian food fix. The selection changes every day and everything is good. I never leave here disappointed.

LOVE LOVE LOVE This place! I was feeling sore from a work out and got the first time member's price...  Deep Tissue never felt so good. I liked it so much I got the membership... I was going every other week but then decided to upgrade myself and go weekly. What the hell... This is my weekly treat to myself.   Dennis is really good for deep tissue but he hurt himself so my new guy is Brano. He's just as good. For a little guy he sure can put the pressure on. Can't wait for my Friday appointment...  The whole membership deal is not bad at all... 1 free massage a month and they have a location in Costa Mesa so I can get my massage when I am in Southern Cali. They have locations all over the place so it is convenient but still a little dangerous because I am contemplating on doing a 30 minute massage during lunch. Who needs to eat right? LOL

A co-worker brought this into work one Friday... I became an instant fan. I am not big on sweet or donuts but this place is sooo good. The donuts are huge and they taste homemade not commercial like Crispy Kreme. I order the manager's dozen for work for Fridays.

The juice bar here is full of sh!t!!!! They are never open and the excuse the front desk tells me is that they are not affiliated with LA fitness and the owner just opens it when he wants. That is not an acceptable response.... the gym itself is great... good equipment, hot guys to looks at and hook up with. You get 1 star until you change up that crappy ass juice bar that's never open. It's a waste of space!

Food is yummy and drinks are just as good. The seaweed salad is one of the best I have tasted in the valley. I like mine a little more dry but the flavor is spot on. The Poke is great and I could eat it as a meal. Did I mention that the Poke taste like a little piece of Hawaiian heaven?  I had the blackened fish which was good. It had some mango salsa on it but I am not a big mango salsa fan so I had to put that to the side. The Poke alone has me hooked on this place.  The architecture of this place is pretty cool... It was different and a good topic of conversation when you're on a first date. Even the bathrooms are done up pretty nice. I like the tongue and groove wood panels that go half way up the wall. Very nice touch! Even the sink was unique.   The only thing I did not like were the sweet potatoe pomme frites (french fries). They were soggy... and that is a personal thing... I am not a big fan of soggy fries. I like my potatoes to be croquant (Crunchy).

I saw all the reviews on this place and thought I would go here for lunch. The only bad thing I can think of is that it is too close to my work.   First thing I noticed was this place had Kim-chee, seaweed salad. and fried fish skin!!! They basically had me at hello.  The seafood delight is the best I have tasted from a buffet. Very well flavored and not drowning in sauce and brocolli. The stuffed crab was great and they had vegie tempura that was good too. The short ribs were well seasoned. Everything I tasted was good considering it was a buffet. The dishes were always being refilled and I never had to wait for anything.   Not having too much of a sweet tooth I decided to just walk by the dessert section. Big mistake! They had nilla waffers covered with banana pudding. Can you say comfort food? So I grabbed a little and on my way back to my seat I picked up a malisada (donut) and fried banana. All was good!

I agree with the first review... This is the best market in the area. I did see some organic or free range beef when I was there today. What I couldn't find was aged beef although the butcher pointed out that the premium steaks they had were at least 12 to 15 days old.  They really have a good variety here... and don't forget the sushi station they have. You won't find that at any of the other markets in the area. Their fried chicken is the best in town also. It is a quick dinner for a small price. They have low carb items that other markets in the area do not carry. This is my market of choice since moving to AZ.

I just found this place about 2 weekds ago and I have been here twice already. It is about a 40 minutes drive for me but well worth it. The strip mall it is in is very ghetto.   Food here is a little on the hot side so be warned.... Medium is more like HOT.   I love the appetizer platter that has a little bit of everything. The fried tofu is sooo yummy.  I can order that for my dinner and be satisfied. The Thai Spicy fried rice is really flavorfull. I like their fried catfish with some red sauce... Very good as well.  The next time I go I am getting green curry with beef...

This is my little gem in the city... I can call them at midnight and still order chillaquilles!  I have tried the different dinner specials they have and I constantly tell myself, "Oh they need to put this on the menu..." Oh and I can taste hints of chocolate in the mole sauce.  I'm getting hungry just writing this review and I think I know where I'm going to grab some dinner! But seriously.. check this place out. Great menu and flavors!
