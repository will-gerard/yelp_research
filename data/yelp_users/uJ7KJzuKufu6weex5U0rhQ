Lots of excellent food for cheap.  Got the tuna sandwich and it was awesome.  The staff are hilarious, too.

Absolutely terrible. The overweight, ugly, disgusting 'manager' of the store - I couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman - sees that my check engine and ABS lights are on because my sensor chip in my car is messed up (note: The car is just fine. I take it to a mechanic every 3 months or less), and STILL charges me $20 without even conducting the full test. In fact, she knows it's going to fail the whole time and does it anyways.  This place is a scam and this location in particular - I'm filing complaints with all of the offices, both written and verbal (ADEQ) and I hope that this location in particular is shut down and that the 'manager' (who didn't wear a name tag, which is either out of shame or the sure sign of a scam) is FIRED.  Private functions need to replace all State functions within the next 5 years. Scottsdale, we can be first - let's kick public industry out of our city.

Wasting millions of dollars to have public industry take hours to do what private industry could do in minutes. We need to close every MVD/DMV in the US and replace them with an independent, private equivalent.   If you gave this or any government facility more than 1 star - you are what is wrong with our country, please leave immediately.
