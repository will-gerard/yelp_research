I would generally agree with the rest of the reviews. I went here for the first time last weekend (I had only gone to the Tempe store before), and agree that this place does seem to be better organized. The space seems better laid out, and the staff seems a lot friendlier here. Well, honestly I haven't had anyone be mean to me at the Tempe store, but the people here were just super helpful when I was trying to pick out jeans. I went to the fitting room like three different times trying on different sizes, and they very helpful trying to help me sort out what I had already tried on and what I needed to bring in with me.   If you're looking for more designer labels, I'd say Tempe is the better bet. I was looking for dress/work pants, and there were a few more here. It could have just been that way this weekend, but in general, you shouldn't come here looking for a good slack or dress pant score. These stores mainly have jeans in their pants area. It's worth checking out if you haven't been before.

I HATE flying, thanks TSA for making travel suck more than it has to. PHX is better than most because it has a waiting lot for people that are waiting for passengers instead of making them circle endlessly like vultures or park for $2/30mins. This airport also has pretty decent food for a decent price that's not the usual crap they try to pass for food for way more than its worth (Yes, I'm talking about you Houston!)   The US Air line is always way long, but if you fly out of any other terminal, the lines are really tolerable.

The food here is a tad pricey, but I forget that most Korean places will bring out their array of side dishes (kimchi, potatoes, anchovy, seaweed?, etc.) Other than that, I'm used to my BBQ having more of a BBQ flavor. Yes, that charred, I'm going to give you cancer eventually carcinogen flavor - don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about! The flavor was still really good but not exactly 5 star quality. ,   Pluses are that they refilled side dishes! I've never been to any other Korean place that offered. They also refill your drinks, abd the kimchi doesn't make your mouth feel like its going to burn off.  =) All in all, its a very nicely decorated mom and pop run place that makes really quality food.

I come here probably at least once a week. The prices are right, there's a good variety of "ethnic" food, the cashiers are quick and friendly, and they're just helpful. I locked myself out of my car when having a space-cadet moment and they let me use their phone to call AAA to bail me out.   Fresh flowers + great selection of wine and cheese + all the essentials   They deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they don't have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible. =) GO TJ'S!

I came here for my routine cleanings and to have a mouth guard made.   My student dentist is sweet, easy to talk to, and explains what she's going to do. Yes, you will get probed here and they'll do a lot of other things that normal dentists probably won't do to you, but its sorta neat to learn about it.   The facility is brand new and the first dental school in Arizona, so support your future dentist! =) Prices here are lower than your regular DDS because they're in training and it will probably take a bit longer to have the procedure done.

I'm somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. This place has pretty good food. I like that they have kalua pork, which other Hawaiian places don't have. I also like that I don't HAVE to have the macaroni salad, but I don't like the fact that sometime things are over salted. Their rice is always perfect and leaves me wanting more than two scoops.This place does satisfy cravings I have for good rice plates, and they also have a pretty diverse menu.   They also have luau's once a month that's $10 for all you can eat food and drink with music. I haven't been, but am thinking about checking it out...

This place was OK. I'd give it 2.5 stars. I had a bowl of pho and the worst freaking lemonade ever. It tasted like it was made of sugar and water and threw in a lemon just to pretend that it was a lemonade. I had high hopes because they place looked pretty busy for a lunch crowd, but looks are deceiving.    I'm told I can't compare California food to Arizona food, but that is a load of crap. If you don't hold food to higher standards, how are they going to improve? I know I sound like your 7th grade teacher that tells you that you have a lot of potential, and you aren't living up to it, but thats how I feel about Saigon Pho.   The price point is right, and they're not trying to charge me something crazy like $7 for a bowl of pho like *ahem* other places...   I might give this place one more chance, cause my friend that went with me told me they were having an off day... but we shall see.

It hurts my inner Asian to give Dim Sum only two starts, but this place is lacking. This place would be out of business so quick if it were in California. I've been to take out Dim Sum places that would shame this place.   The best dish was probably just average, and there were some that were... not good. Please do not just Dim Sum from this place, its not a good representation.

I thought these guys had another review because that's how I found them. The Kobar brothers are awesome.   I took my car to Big-O Tire in Tempe for a tire rotation and they told me that I needed A, B, and C done. I know that I had some wear, but they made it sound like it was unsafe for me to drive with my tires. Anyways, I decided to get a second opinion, so I went to Kobar Auto. Not only was the services priced lower at Kobar, but they reassured me that I didn't need new tires right away. They estimated that I had another 10,000 miles to go.   As a girl that doesn't know a whole lot about auto maintenance, its hard to know when someone is trying to swindle you, but I trust these guys and if I'm ever in doubt, I'll go to them!

Did this place used to be a bank? I was trying to figure out what one of the dark little studying holes used to be. It had an interesting door, which I assume was some type of vault before? Oh well, that's not really important.   I think that this place is the coffee shop I've been looking for. Good drinks, reliable wifi even for the amount of people that are there using it. There's even a drive thru for people that want something on the go. The only beef I have with this place is NO SPLENDA. WTF. There's only Equal offered as a sugar substitute.  This is the only thing keeping me from giving five stars, because they have great hours too.

I have to downgrade this place.   I feel sad about this, but the last two drinks I've had were shitty. Too much freaking milk, and not enough java. Also, there are SOOO many people there now, that it's hard to get yourself situated. Isn't it summer break?!? Shouldn't all the ASUers be somewhere else?!

I have been a beader on and off for about ten years. I have been to many bead stores, and this one is awesome.   I didn't know that they have FREE classes at the store until I looked at their website, but most other places charge $40-100+ for a single class. When I first went, it was a weekend where they were having a sale, and there were tons of people there. Their regular price is pretty reasonable, but sale days are even more awesome. It's hard not to get overwhelmed because there is just soooo much stuff in one store. And don't let the store front fool you, this place is large and in charge.   If this is something you do at least semi-regularly, I would suggest getting on the mailing list because they have sales pretty often. One critic I have is that their chain selection was not super great to me. There was a lot of it, but not all of them were really what I was looking for. I told this to a sales guy and he was shocked. He said I should just more beads instead of chain. Hah! People here are friendly and helpful in trying to get you what you need! Highly recommended!

This gets 5 stars because its the best Indian food I've had in Arizona. Granted, all I've been eating the last two weeks prior to this was freggin' hospital food, and this may skew the view slightly, but OH MY GOD! It was so good to taste good food!   The naan was perfect. Buttery, with some charred crisp to it, properly seasoned with garlic and non-descript green herb. This buffet also had chai and a pretty good dessert bar. Service was friendly and attentive without being too in your face. I'm planning on going back soon.

I've been back and it is still equally as yummy!   Last time they had a mushroom curry, which I've never heard of, but it was delish! It was also really empty when I came last week and I was sad. This place is so great, but its in this crappy strip mall where everything else has gone out of business. Its sort of tucked away, but totally worth the effort to look!

I recently purchased something from the REI website, and it shipped free to the Tempe store. (As with online purchases which can be tricky,) The item was too large for me and I was able to return it to the store without any problems or hassles. The staff is super friendly, and the only reason I don't give them five stars is because the store is somewhat small compared to other outdoor goods stores, which means a more limited selection. Online may be the way to go without worrying about return shipping... or heck., shipping fees at all!

I got a highlights and a cut for $55 which is what I would just pay for a normal haircut at places I used to go.   I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out, but my student is about to graduate and had a lot of experience under her belt (those are the best kind to get!) which also meant less time in the chair. Woo!   I left totally happy, but some friends have told me that they haven't be as happy with their cuts here which is what prevents a 5 star rating. The place is sorta loud and does feel different from a salon (like there was a line forming for the wash stations because everyone's color was done at the same time), but it's totally a good deal to go. Where else are you going to get color so inexpensively??!?!

This place is better equipment that the rock climbing gym I used to frequent in SF. They also change the walls, which I'm not sure happens at all places. It also has what looks like a pretty decent bouldering area, but I don't have arms of steel yet, so I haven't tried it out.   There was no first timer orientation charge that I had to pay elsewhere, you just watch a simple video on the basics and safety, which you should pay attention to because they have a mini quiz on how to tie in and belay. The gym is pretty decent size, and wasn't too crowded on a weekend afternoon when I went. No waiting for ropes, so you could climb one of the two 5.7's or something.   They have lockers there too, but the pickings were limited, so try to throw everything in your car if you can. The staff are friendly and helpful, so give it a shot!

This place leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to decor.   My family popped in for a bite after they got off the plane. I wasn't too hungry, so I got spring rolls, which were alright. Not great, but good. My mom and dad had a bowl of pho, and both said they weren't great. Which is pretty bad since they're not really ones to give negative feedback.   There's better pho out there.

This is your typical Buffalo Exchange. I've been to others in San Francisco and San Diego, and they're all pretty much the same. Yes, they're super picky brand name whores about what they buy from you, but it means that there are some really great items for a much smaller price tag. I've gotten dresses that people always compliment and things that I've bought on impluse because I thought it was a great buy, and wore once.   The building this one is located in leaves a lot to be desired, but  there are good buys inside. I walked away with a great pair of skinny jeans, a cute top, and a super comfy dress for under $50 =).

I went to a football game here with the bf awhile ago. We had cheap tickets, but still thought that the view was pretty decent even in the nosebleed section. We also parked waaaay out in the boonies, and there was a shuttle service that was easy and accessible.   The new stadium was clean, has your standard concession stand, and the bathrooms here are the only place where there's a longer line for the men's restroom than the ladies restroom. I've been to a few other stadiums before, and this is by far the nicest. I also dig that its an indoor/outdoor stadium.

I love this place. The food, the atmosphere (despite the cafeteria style like line - I think it sorta adds to its charm), and the atmosphere are totally on point.   Everyone I've taken here loves it. It's just really good. I personally was won over by the bottled sodas and the cheesy potatoes. Don't get me wrong, the pulled pork is fantastic too, but you don't see bottle sodas very often, and I heart potatoes.   It's also located in a really cute part of Gilbert which looks like an old town of somesort (forgive my ignorance, I'm a newbie here.)

Things I like about the Roosevelt:  - You can park right in front of it, and have rockstar parking! - They have hard cider. (I'm not too big on beer.) - Great service - Clean bathrooms - This is impressive being that it is a bar/tavern.  - Good place to sit and chat with friends even though its not a "lounge" - We went on a Wednesday night - Laid back vibe - Food was actually quite tasty  What is there not to like?

I don't get this place.   First - Chicks don't like to go to a place where girls are being hosed down with water. Why would I want to see a girl in a bikini look like she's showering without soap in front of me? I get that guys are all about this, but no... don't do that.   Second - Why the hell would an artist be painting in a night club.   I just don't get you Myst!

This place is teeny bopper central. I never went to Arizona Mills before going to this theater, so I didn't think it was going to be that bad. Uhh, I was wrong.   The theater itself was adequate. I just think that the massive crowds of high schoolers made me wary of ever coming to this place again. It is crowded as all heck. And I had the strangest feeling that people were looking at me like, "what are you doing here?" because I didn't wear my Twilight t-shirt and don't know the first thing about High School Musical.

God, why did I ever go back?  I had low expectations coming here again, because of what it was like the last time, but this time it was worse. We sat in these seats which reeked of BO, and had to move several times to a seat that wasn't nasally offensive. WTF.

Not feeling this place.   I heard so much about their freaking pizza here, and I'm sorry but you need to try Zachary's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/zacharys-chicago-pizza-oakland#hrid:D4WR-ODCz7HzmFihXKblQg/query:zachary's)  and see what good deep dish is.  When I first walked in, EVERYONE said hello that worked there, which is fine I suppose, but its weird. Our waiter was helpful, but then later said it didn't matter how much I ate (after I said I was full), because I was just going to throw it all back up anyway. He apologized, but what the hell?  The food was just ok. A lot of freaking cheese doesn't equal good pizza.

This place has its own credit card or rewards card or some sort, which I thought was ... interesting. Actually, the whole place is interesting. I was sort of unsure where the restaurant would be since the main entrance brings you to a staircase (you go up).   The food was good, although it was a little rich for me. I like the salad room is really cute and goes along with the historic building. It has some different things like pickled quail eggs, but your regular salad bar staples as well.  It was on the pricey side, but your entree allows you unlimited access to the salad room so you get a lot of bang for your buck.

The drinks are really great here: the chai and mocha are my favorite, but they have quality coffee too. There's a big outdoor area that's usually occupied by smokers and sun bathers, and an equally large inside area for people that prefer to be surrounded by walls.   They used to have free wifi, but now you have to get a code for the wifi when you get a drink beceause people were stealing the internet. Its still a great study spot, that's open late for people getting your late night study on.

This place wishes it was Whole Foods or something. I get that you're trying to be an upscale market and all, with your marked up prices and such. Just don't try to pull that crap off with things you can find half price (ok, maybe an exaggeration) for the same exact product elsewhere.   The store is large is there is a good selection, but I was not impressed.

I used to work at a bakery, so I have a soft spot for bread companies/places. Some things are better than others. The veggie sandwich is very tasty, but falls apart really easily. I tried the butternut squash pasta, and it was too sweet... it was almost desert-like while trying to be savory. Anyways, it didn't work for me, but the other day I got linguine with clams and that TOTALLY hit the spot with the yummy garlic bread. Pastas are available after 3pm, are at a good price point, with a good portion size. It's not like I'm going to feed you for three meals, but its filling if you have the bread with the meal. They also have some pastries that I haven't tried, but look very appealing.   Oh, also free wifi, but please don't be talking on your bluetooth while online shopping the whole time. That bugs.

This place is either hit or miss. The first time I was here my soba was soo salty that I couldn't finish my noodles, and I'm a girl that loves her noddles. I came back again, and got the curry and it was really pretty decent. I friend ordered the pad thai, and I know its not authentic, but there was something in the sauce that made me think, wow, maybe this place isn't as bad as I thought.   I went back earlier this week to get my own pad thai and was disappointed once again. I don't know if its the change in the moon cycle, the way the wind blows, or which chef is making the food, but it totally stumps me how this place can be so on and off. Overall, more off times than on, so I'm going with 2 stars.

This place is very visually appealing, but not super practical for people who are using this as a study cafe. I'm average height, and I found myself bending further than I would like to get to the table. It makes your back tense up after awhile, but the tea was good, the service is great, and its a good people watching spot.  It does get loud at times, and I think they have games at the bar. For me it seems like a better hang out with friends and lounge awhile than a study place even though they're pushing the free wifi for the cafe crowd. The location is sort of odd, but is good if you want to multi-task and get some shopping out of the way.

I went here on Sunday after I picked up my roommate from the airport. His flight was delayed so I was driving in circles with some serious hunger pangs. We decided to go get Indian food because we haven't had any since we moved here a couple of months ago. We had the Lamb Saag, Aloo Palak, and Garlic naan with complimentary papadum. Everything we ordered was great, esp. the Lamb Saag.   So, now I'm on Yelp reading the review that Phil G has written, and I have to respectfully disagree. Although, this was the first time I had Indian food in the valley, it was super delicious. The only thing that prevents me from giving it a 5 star rating that it is a tad pricey and service left something to be desired in terms of friendliness (maybe its because I asked for tamarind sauce to go with the papadum since it only came with one (mint?) chutney and that was totally blasphemous out here, and they couldn't look at me the same way again... I was told the tamarind chutney didn't really go with the papadum, and they were totally right... it was super sweet and wasn't what I was used to ) On the other hand, my water was never empty and they have really cool lighting.   Some points of disagreement are that they are NOT strictly an a la carte place. They have an all you can eat lunch buffet, which I imagine as being equally as yummy from 11-2:30 PM for $8.99 a head ($5.99 for the kiddies under 8). I completely plan on making a visit during lunch hours and stuffing my face on a day when I miss being home or being with my boy because we always go out to eat Indian food together.  (Ah, the life of a graduate student...)   All in all, I think the food was totally worth it because its been days, and all I can do is think about going back and how yummy everything was.

Great service! Don't worry if you don't know what things are, just ask, and they'll let you know.    Happy Hour is where its at. 5-7PM with specials on appetizers, rolls, and sake bombers. Things are fresh, tasty, and in a cute atmosphere. They also have pretty good lunch specials.

I really wanted to like you Apple Dumpling. I was sort of mislead thinking this was going to be Asian Dumpling place, but when we walked it, my friend said it was like stepping into her grandmother's house in the Midwest. We stayed despite completely different expectations, and it was good and tasty comfort food. They're known for their custard (with apple dumplings?), but they were out of custard when we were there.   A few hours later, my friend and I were studying, and the food didn't sit right for either one of us. I'm not sure if its because they don't fry their food, and I don't know what alternative cooking method is used, but it didn't go over very well. Sorry Apple Dumpling, I tried!

Friendly service!  The super pink walls sorta make my eyes bleed, but I get that that's their thing. I still think that the new mango flavor tastes like my peach yogurt (pre-stirred from the supermarket), but whatevs. Its tart, tasty, and really good in the heat right now. I had my mango with mochi, which is really a lot sweeter than I would have expected. It's also a lot chewy-er than I would think; more so than tapioca balls.   There's not a lot of people here (yet?), so its great to spot to sit and chat for awhile. =)

This is the one mall out here that I like. Its got a lot of the stores that I frequent (Sephora, VS, Banana Republic, Forever 21, Body Shop etc.), and a movie theater. They have misters in the summer, since its an outdoor mall.   Parking is pretty hassle free. The only thing I don't like is how In and Out is across the street. I guess its not upscale enough to hang with the other food establishments on this side of the street or something stupid like that.

So I had a faulty piece of Mac equipment, and remembered that there was an Apple store in this mall. Oh boy. You know all shopping trips turn out so innocently.   The Apple Store is getting 5 stars, because #1 - they exchanged my cord hassle free, and #2 - I didn't have to wait in a crazy long line at the Genius Bar like I thought I would have to. A guy asked if I needed help, and I told him what was going on, and I was in and out of there in about 5 mins. No hassle about receipts, boxes, or any of that crap that I was worried may happen.   Then I walk over to Banana because the last time I was there I found some great deals on dress pants, and I was hoping lighting would strike twice. I wander around and find a suit on sale. I'm about to finish grad school, so I figured a suit would be a good investment, so I buy it. I get home and find out that one of the sensor tags is still on. Mind you, they had already taken this big rope thing off the jacket already, and you think that that would be enough, but no. They had to be extra careful. I figure I'll just go back, and get it taken off when I get the chance, and might as well ask if there's been any price adjustments since I was last there, since I have to go back anyway.   I go back next week, they take the tag off, I ask about the price adjustment, and they say sorry, that it's been more then 7 days, so they can't price adjust me. Oh well. In the meantime, I pick up some nice dress shirts for my dad and brother. I have absolutely no clue what size they wear in shirts, let alone what neck size they have. The sales guy was helpful, and I ended up getting two shirts for them.   Across the street was a VS Semi Annual Sale, and in true Becky Bloomberg fasion (a la Shopoholic series), I say I'm just going to take a look, and come back out with more than I planned to.   Why Santan Village! Why do you make me spend so much money!

I'm surprised to read the bad review about Sprouts. Honestly, I haven't bought a lot of their meat because I come for other things, but its never been a problem for me.   I didn't know this before I went to this Sprouts, but I LOVE pink lady apples. They are also usually on sale too, which makes me happy (and even when they're not, they're cheaper than other places). Other things that make me love Sprouts: their corn muffins are delish, they have a regular bulk section, but they also have a bulk spice section. Who wants to pay friggin $3 for a tiny jar of spice, when you need a tablespoon for a recipe you're trying out?   I assume they also have a good deli because I see people getting the lunch special here, but I've never tried it.

I went here after being picked up from the airport with my roommate. She had been to a happy hour here before and liked it so I said, "sure, lets go."  The atmosphere was nice, but I should have heeded my own hesitation about the name of this place. I usually steer clear of any pan Asian offerings because no one can do all Asian cooking well. I rather have one cuisine that someone done right then a pan Asian place with so-so everything.   This place ended up just being that. Their non-happy hour menu is a tad on the pricey side with smaller rolls and fewer pieces for what I've come to expect for the price point. Oh, and there is gratuitous use of eel sauce. Holy cow! Everything that had eel sauce just tasted like it was drowning in a sea of eel sauce. This place is just alright.

I know, you're thinking... a review of Target? Duh, we all know what Target is!   Anyways, I come from California, and I have never seen a SuperTarget before. I guess it's like a WalMart Superstore, except I don't feel dirty when I leave SuperTarget. (P.S. I hate WalMart, and try to avoid shopping there as much as I can. )   SuperTarget is like regular Target + Supermarket + Optical store = everything I need. I'm basically pretty effin blind. This has been confirmed by my optometrist, who has said it a bit nicer than that, but we know when we get the super condesnsed lenses and they look coke-bottley that you're pretty effin blind. Anyways, Target optical is THE BEST. Their prices on frames and lenses are so reasonable, and their staff does not care if you spend hours, and literally, I have probably put on and tried over 50% of their frames to see if I'd like it and if it would be good for me (AKA my lenses would fit in it without it being too obvious that I'm Mrs. Magoo.) If you have any problems with it. I think they have a 90 day return policy, so you can go get another pair if you decide that you're not totally in love with the ones you already paid for.   I can't say enough good things about Target Optical! I don't know why this place isn't any busier, but I guess cause it's sort of tucked away, but seriously, its worth it to go there if you want/need glasses.

Reasons why I like Mood Swings:  1. The Aveda smell - when I first when, I walked in, and thought whoa, this is... herbal. But it grows on you and now I love that smell!  2. Free bang trims for established clients - no appointment is needed. Just walk in when you need a bang trim.  3. Coupons - who doesn't like a deal?   4. Massages - they put a hot towel on your wet hair, which I haven't had at other salons before, and give you a nice hand massage as you're having a little mini retreat.   Some girls are better than others. I like that they give you suggestions as to what they think would look good on you, because sometimes I just don't really know what I want. Anywho, I'm sad that I'm moving and I won't be near this salon anymore =(.
