We have been dining here every Dec 24th for 9 straight years now and we have had exceptional food and service every year! They offer such great food specials that can't be beat. Their food is on par with other top steak restaurants but we have always been the most impressed by the outstanding service we receive. The waitresses we have had have all been very friendly, enjoyable and prompt to the table we each course and/or beverage. We always look forward to this holiday meal tradition to start off our Christmas Holidays.

BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse has well over a hundred menu items, fifty craft beers and a very friendly, high-energy attitude. (Plus TVs, of course.) Known for their deep dish pizza and handcrafted beer, BJ's is popular with all ages and offers a great value on every meal.

What an extraordinary experience from A-Z. We were greeted by name upon checking in. We were seated immediately and acknowledged that it was our wedding anniversary on the way to our table. Upon being seated we received a complementary starter dish, a happy anniversary card signed by the staff and was greeted by our waiter who was the utmost friendly, professional and attentive waiter we have ever met! We enjoyed 2 unbelievable Ribeyes, cooked and seasoned to perfection. They should call their steaks "Crack Steaks" because once you have had one, you are hooked and must have another! Our waiter guided us through the entire meal experience making sure that we were happy and pampered. He even suggested that we share a potato rather than ordering one each as they were so large. Our waiter also suggested an incredible red wine to complement the steak. it was reasonably priced and a perfect steak companion! Our waiter also recommended that we order dessert early so that it would be ready to be served promptly upon completing our meals. Once again, absolutely delicious!!! The entire dining experience was beyond words. We have NEVER had a better meal, service or experience than we experienced at Flemings. So if that was not enough, we were presented with a delicious box of truffles and a $25 gift card as a wedding anniversary gift before we left. Are you kidding me??? I am currently seeking that Flemings adopt me so that I can be fed and cared for in this same manner everyday!

Teakwoods has a great atmosphere with plenty of TVs around the place; wings and cheese curds seem to be among the favorite appetizers. And everyone loves the bucket of peanuts on the table and being able to throw shells on the floor without being scolded. Some of the best hot wings that I have ever had...and they always have cold, local beer on tap.

Service has been a wee bit slow. Bad luck is table/waitress. Hope the food is better.

Let me start by saying the food was delicious and cooked to our liking. However, the portions were very small. Don't come here if you are looking for the "Hungryman" dinner. The service was where our family was greatly disappointed. We waited far too long to receive the next course (15+ minutes) and our waiter was no where to be found, never checking to see how we liked our dinner. My water glass set empty during half the meal until I snagged a busboy to fill it for me. I saw our waiter only once during the meal when he did a "flyby" through his serving area, not making eye contact with any of his tables. We waited and waited to order an after dinner beverage and when it was finally brought to the table, our waiter tried to leave both glasses with the closest person rather than distribute them accordingly. Our waiter shall go nameless here as I do not wish to humiliate openly on the web, but something was not quite right with this guy! Not just his absence, but his actions, speech, facial expressions and demeanor. I think that this establishment needs to reevaluate its hiring/training standards.

We went to Roy's for a "date night" and most certainly did not choose wrong! We fell in love with Roy's when we were in Kauai and this location surpassed even that! From the edamame they serve instead of bread to the lobster potstickers to the Cesar salad, everything was melt in your mouth delicious! I had the Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi, and it was truly a dissolve in your mouth tender with a light crunch coating. We shared 2 martinis before dinner. The 1988 and a pineapple one. Both were fabulous. This has become our new favorite place to go for special dinners or anytime dinners for that matter. The service was excellent, though a tad slow coming from the kitchen, but since every thing is to order, that's understandable. The decor and ambiance was spectacular , lots of bamboo, flowers and tiki torches with a modern twist. Definite go to this place! You cannot go wrong!!

I wish I had more space to comment so in brief; I called the Restaurant 3 different days to discuss my upcoming anniversary. Each time the phone just rings until you must leave a message. On my 3rd attempt, I did leave a message requesting the Mgr to call me back. The next day I did hear from an associate who told me the Mgr would call me later that same day when he arrives. That return call never came. The food service was very slow, had to wait approx 15 min between courses, which is probably why we were seated 25 min late for a 7pm RSVP. The food was merely average, employees were polite and formal but had zero personality like working with robots. For a $282 dinner for 2, I don't see Donovan's as an establishment that I could recommend.  All areas of opportunity seem to revolve around the Restaurant's people/employees and there performance and execution or lack there of. This change in culture and performance must of course begin from the top with the Restaurant Manager who himself, fails to display a commitment to customer service and a fine dining experience. Your Restaurant is a good example that just because the meal is expensive, doesn't guarantee that the food and service will match. I no longer consider Donovan's as a premiere dining destination.

They have really expanded the menu since the last time we were here. Lots of tasty entr√©es for you to consider. I had a very hard time choosing. I must encourage you try and Electric Iced Tea, if you're into adult beverages. We enjoyed the Carne Asada Chimichanga & the Enchilada Trio.. DELICIOUS!

I am a 20 year Realtor and I just hired Nick for the first time and he was fantastic. He explained everything clearly and gave my buyers suggestions and solutions. Nick let us know if any issues were significant and his explanations made my buyers feel more comfortable about the home they were looking to purchase. Personally, I found Nick's knowledge of FHA safety guidelines to be great resource in determining what issues had to be corrected in order to get the loan approved. I highly recommend Nick to anyone looking to buy. I will be using Nick as my Home Inspector going forward.

So I dropped by this Native New Yorker for a quick bite since my local favorite hang Old Chicago, closed down. I ordered a Bronx Calzone (again missing Old Chicago's) and well... don't bother ordering those here. I swear that the ingredients used were merely packaged cold cuts from a grocery store. However, the service was excellent!!! **Native New Yorker; quit attempting to sell raffle tickets to your poatrons while they are dining and start paying more attention to the kitchen!!

Ronda has been cleaning my home exclusively for years. She works extremely hard and quick. She brings all her own chemicals and equipment which I really like. She is always on time and will clean anything that I ask her to clean. Im so glad that I found such a friendly, hard worker as Ronda and at such a reasonable rate. I always tip Ronda because of the consistent quality of work that she provides. Thanks Ronda!!
