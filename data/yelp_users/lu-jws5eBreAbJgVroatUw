I love Dunkin Donuts, but not for the donuts (for that I go to KK or QT).  I love the wraps and breakfast sandwiches.  My somewhat weekly splurge is the turkey sausage egg-white flatbread.  I often get the $.99 egg and cheese wake-up wrap.  For about a buck I get my protein fix for the morning in a tasty tortilla.    I was a huge fan of McD's iced coffee, but that is like 70% sugar, so its essentially a soda parading as coffee.  DD's iced coffee actually tastes like coffee, cream & sugar, and their hot coffee tastes like coffee - not frappamocalattechino.

We first went to Sushi Kee about 6 years ago when we lived in the area.  It felt like any new sushi place.  We have since been back twice in the past 3 months, recently for my birthday.    We were there on a Wednesday night, and the place was more dead than the fish that they serve.  We considered the all-you-can-eat deal, but after sharing a few bad experience, we opted to just buy sushi and maki.    A friend of mine and I each got our own bottle of cold sake (note to Sushi Kee - Hana Awaka is awesome, you need to cary it) and proceeded to slam down some really outstanding sushi.  The 6 of us cleared 8 rolls, soup and salad, and a few pieces of sushi.    Right as we all were throwing in the towel, the waitress brought over a complementary special, that we called WhatToDoWithLeftoverBits.  It was a lightly fried california roll covered in diced ahi, salmon, cucumber, and a few other items.  SIMPLY AWESOME.

With another Pho place in the same strip mall, and another just up the road (Pho Ah Sen), there is a lot of competition for Pho Van to deal with.  This was my second visit to Pho Van.  The first was my wife's first Pho experience, and it went well.  Although the place is clean, I always find it funny how these little asian places are designed with furniture and whatnot.    This time I got Pho with brisket and beef, vegetarian spring rolls, and Thai iced tea, all to go.  It took them about 10 minutes to get everything done and wrapped up, and off to home I went.  The set up for to-go orders are just fine.  The meat, which is rare (wife thought it was raw) was in the same box as the vegies and noodles, which would be fine, but wife was scared because it was so rare.  I assured her it was fine.  The soup needed to be heated in the microwave because it wasn't warm enough, even though I only had a 5 minute ride home.  The noodles were correctly undercooked so that they wouldn't be too soft when added to the soup.    The broth is quite excellent and I loved the brisket.  Pho Ah Sen gets the thumbs up for the atmosphere, but I'd got to Pho Van any day of the week.

We recently celebrated our 10th anniversary.  We were recently given a gift certificate to Shula's, and after finding a good rate using Expedia, decided to also stay the night.  Prior to our arrival, I e-mailed the rooms manager and let her know it was our anniversary in case they did anything nice for folks like us.  I got an e-mail the next day from the concierge letting me know we would be upgraded.  I'm not a guy that asks for free stuff, but this was a nice surprise - I thought, at best, we might get a fruit platter.  Check-In We pulled in around 4pm for check-in and Valet'd the car.  There was only one bellman/valet available, who was nice.  Check in was very smooth - they use a credit card reader display instead of paper, which is the first time I've seen that.  As a former front-desk agent, paperless check-in sounds awesome.    The Room Our upgrade was to a beautiful suite on the 6th floor (Room 601).  There are (by my calculations) only 9 of these rooms, which are called "South Corner Suites".  They have a small kitchen with full refrigerator, sitting area with flat screen, a separate half bath, nice king size bed and huge bathroom with double vanity, granite countertops, shower and Jacuzzi tub.    Hotel provides complementary water bottles - a rarity - and does have turn down services with mints.    The bed is very comfortable, but BRING YOUR OWN PILLOW.  Their pillows are very large, and a bit hard for my liking.  Water pressure is good.  I did use the jacuzzi tub, spending some time reading.  When I turned the jets off, I noted a strange green watermark on the side of the tub.  No, that didn't come from me.  Perhaps it was some grease from the jets?  I hope ...  The Food I'll review Shula's separately.  It was good, but very pricey.  A proper dinner for 2 (appetizer, main dish, side) with alcohol will run $200.    We did eat breakfast in the cafe in the morning.  Very reasonable pricing.  Wife had french toast and I had pancakes.  Nothing spectacular, but zero to complain about.    The Pool Very nice pool.  It was the perfect temp, and although it was the summer, there were great clouds that kept the temps in the mid-90s.  We had drinks - virgin pina colada for my preggo wife, and a great frozen margarita for me.  Only drawback - bar/kitchen is far from the entrance to the pool, and the deck is hot.  Wear sandals!  The pool wasn't super busy, and the bar was dead - I'd recommend the hotel have the bartender walk around and try to do some selling - you'd increase your revenue for sure.  I would have had a 2nd drink easy if I was asked.    Want to be a high-roller?  You can reserve one of 6 or 7 cabanas.  I didn't inquire about the price, but it is an added luxury.    Check-out Nothing unexpected.    Casino We walked through in the morning.  Lots of good games and great colors.  Looks like a lot of fun.  Until you see the people playing the games.  Then you get depressed.  Very, very depressed.  This is why we have Social Security?  The casino is almost completely separated from the hotel, which is great for families.    Thanks WHP!  We've used Harrah's as a getaway in the past, but all that might be over!

After posting about a visit to the Tempe location on facebook, a buddy expressed a desire to check out Five Guys.  I met him at the Val Vista location today for lunch with my 4 month old and he brought his 6 year old.    As always, the place was very clean, and although it was lunchtime on a weekend, we were through the line quickly (must have been before the Mormons got out of services).  We both ordered cheeseburgers and his son got a grilled cheese, along with a large order of regular fries.  My buddy loves CheesburgerCheeseburger, so I was anxious to hear how FG compares.  He took his first bite and had a very suprisingly pleased look on his face.  The double patty cheeseburger, complete with plenty of accoutrement, was jucy and flavorful. After a previously distatetful experience with the cajun fries, the regular fries are absolutly superior.    The staff at this location gets extra points for checkin in on us (they knew we had a first timer on our hands) and going the extra mile.  I wanted my friend to check out the cajun fries, but they didn't have any cooked up, so they just gave us some spice to put on the extra fries that we had.  Then, they called the 6 year old over to the counter and gave him a WHOLE NEW FRESH bag of cajun fries.  "We didn't have any samples for you, so we decided to just cook you up a whole batch."  Seriously awesome service!    Sure, the lunch for 2.5 of us cost $25, and I'd only really go for something special, but I have a feeling every visit will be quite excellent!

Please keep in mind I like this place.  I like it enough to want to spend a LOT of money here for a special treat for my staff.  I will not likely eat here again.  Here is a letter I wrote to the management: ========================================== Today I attempted to obtain a reservation for next Tuesday. We have a party of 16 who will be looking to celebrate the end of the tax filing season.   I was informed that it is against policy to take a reservation of that size, opting instead to ensure you have room for walk-ins.   I have no doubt that your restaurant is successful and that things are going well. However, I find it strange that any company would turn away guaranteed revenue in favor of the unknown on an evening in the middle of the week. Perhaps if it were the weekend, I would understand, but on a Tuesday?   When my staff called two weeks ago attempting to schedule, they were given the same answers I was this morning. I simply could not believe it, so I had to call myself. They were given the answer of "we need to make sure we have enough staff on the floor." I would expect that, if scheduled in advance, you would be able to plan for your staffing. I would also assume that a previously unscheduled staff member would be happy to come in for a two hour shift in exchange for a guaranteed tip of over $150 (at 20%).   I look to Rigatony's as a great neighborhood restaurant that would be outstanding to plan a special occasion such as ours. Apparently I was incorrect, unless the party is 12 or less people.   I wish you best of luck in the future.

The location is convenient to my office and easy to get in and out of parking.  If it were as easy to get in and out of the restaurant, I might have another star on my review.  As I was waiting for my to-go order (quoted 5 - 7 minutes, took 10 - 15) I saw numerous patrons attempt to leave the same way they came in, which is where the line was.  The traffic pattern inside is very poorly designed.    I was greeted nicely by a cashier  that looks like she needs to remove her funky earring and get back into high school and get her diploma, but she was friendly and efficient, until she needed to count out the 46 cents in change.  Yes, some people still use cash.  I ordered a mushroom-swiss SmashBurger for me and a Classic for my father.  I added on the sweet-potato fries and a shake.    Since the burgers took a while I had time to savor an outstanding milkshake.  Handmade & mixed, and it tastes of quality.  After I got back to my office, I tore into the burger, which was moist, jucy, and flavorful.  A really outstanding burger that befits the fast-casual restaurant.  Not as impressed with the sweet potato fries though - as my colleage Jason B. mentioned, it seems that they are trying to do too much with them.    2 burgers, a shake and side of fries was almost $20.  Of course, you're paying for quality, but that is very pricy, and I'm not sure it fits the demographic of the area.  I'm certainly down to go for a special occasion, but I just don't see this as any more than an once-a-month place.

I'm sad to give my first experiene here two stars.  I will be back so that I can try it again on a better day.  I came here after driving past the Starbucks and finding it to be too busy.  I also wanted to show off a local business to my inlaws, who are moving to the Islands shortly.  It was a Saturday morning, and only one person was working.  I assume it was the owner.  He was quite flustered and busy.  It took quite a long time to take our order because he had to cook some stuff for another customer.    Besides for the tough customer service experience, the coffee was quite good, and my egg and cheese crissont was awesome with the chili mayo.  We'll give it another try sometime soon and hopefully he'll find some help.

Yummy yummy!  I went there on a Saturday night to find that the owner was closing up.  They were sold out ... except he had one more cupcake he was taking home.  Seeing my disappointment when I went to the door and found it locked, he came back from his car and gave me his last cupcake.  Bannana-nut with cream cheese topping.  My only disappointment was that I had to share it with my wife.  I look forward to returning.

Heard about the restaurant during a Gilbert Chamber of Commerce meeting and immediately decided I was going there for lunch the same day.  This seems to be a sister restaurant to "Christina's Italian Restaurant" a few miles away, also on Williams Field.  The owners have obviously taken over a previously improved space.  Decorations are sparse.  There is a kids play area right by the front door so you can tell immediately that they are catering to families.  There is a bar, but it is really for decoration, as the owners plan on only having beer and wine, and they have not gotten their license yet.  I was there a little early (11:30) but I was the only person besides for one of the owner's family members and two small kids.  It does not seem like it is well set up for sit-down meals.  I perused the menu, which had a few items that were no longer available or aren't really on the menu (they have a "Reuben" with no sauerkraut which is just a hot pastrami sandwich - 'printer error').  I settled on the Chicken Parm sandwich to go.  All sandwiches are served panini style.  Sandwich was quite excellent.  Marinara was flavorful but not over-served (sometimes the sandwich feels like it is swimming in sauce).  Chicken was cooked right and had a nice crisp edge to it.    I look forward to trying their pizza, as I usually get Gilbert Pizza when I want to support local places, but while their pizza is excellent (yum garlic knots), they are short on service.  Hopefully Christina's will pull up strong where Gilbert Pizza falls short.

I'm a current EZ Spaces Member.  I am very pleased with what I get.  Good pricing, comfortable environment, and interesting and engaging membership.  I appreciate having something like this in Gilbert.
