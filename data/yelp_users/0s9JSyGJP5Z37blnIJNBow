I have been taking my dogs to Barks N Bown for years... no issues... excellent customer service... and I can usually get my dogs in when I need.  I would recommend them to anyone!

Customer Service Sucks! When we ordered there was only 1 customer ahead of us, after we ordered there was a line of about 8 people.  It was taking a bit longer than normal even though she was handing out what we ordered to other customer.  When I asked her about my order, she gave me attitude and snapped at me.  We waited over 15 minutes for our order and not once could she muster up an apology.Pretty sad when it was my FIRST and LAST time in this taco shop.  Between her and the 2 cooks they did not get our order, OK no problem just apologize and get on with it, she refused.Her customer service skills suck big time.Would I recommend the place, yes... food is good but I would not recommend when she is taking orders to visit the place.
