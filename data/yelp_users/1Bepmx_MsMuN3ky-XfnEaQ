The food, service and atmosphere at the scottsdale location is not up to par for what I know RA has to offer. The back room smells like peed by the bathrooms and it's not clean. The hostesses were not professional and the servers were even worse! I would not go back to this location!!!!

I ordered Sauce last night to go and I am so Impressed by the service this location offers. The cashier as well as manager were amazing!!! They really know what customer service is.. Also the gluten free noodles option is to die for!!!

When I have a craving for Pho I go to Slanted Rice! Not only is the atmosphere and staff amazing but so is there food!!! If your not in a Pho mood try the firecracker shrimp with garlic noodles... To die for!

I have been getting my hair done by Sarah for the past year and a half. I moved to Arizona three years ago and had been paying SO MUCH for my Brazilian Blow Outs, upwards of $350 at Dulce Salon. I found Sarah on groupon for a Brazilian Blow Out and have been going to her since!!! Her location is perfect in old town, she always makes time for people, she is not crazy expensive, and most importantly she does an amazing job! I have referred many people to her that agree!!!!
