I spent three days looking for a place for my sister. I found myself frustrated because AHCCS does not offer a lot of options and most of the places covered are less than satisfactory. I called Megan at Friendship and right away I knew this was the place for my sister. Megan was professional and caring. The only thing I can say is go in, take a tour and talk to the staff, you'll leave optimistic about treatment. The facility is clean and inviting. If you are in the process of looking for options you can stop here!

On Saturday two friends and I were in Old Town Scottsdale for lunch. We were craving dessert and a friend suggested LGO. Friend no.1 had her eye on a dessert at LGO. Nothing caught our eye for me and friend #2. I'm familiar with Tammie Coe, but have only had items of hers from Whole Foods or AJs.  I saw the sign and suggested Friend no. 2 and I walk over. The minute friend #2 and I walked in Tammie Coe's we were welcomed with open arms. We enter only to see not the regular bakery atmosphere, instead Ammie and two others are working away at creating delicious yummies out in the open.  She asked what we were craving and we mentioned "CHOCOLATE" something LGO didn't have that day. Tammy walks over, gives us a sour cream sugar cookie and OMG! amazing. I ordered the ooey gooey and it was delicious! As we were leaving Tammie gave us a sample of buche de noel, this delectable treat was maybe the best dessert i've ever had. As mentioned before I've heard of Tammie Coe but I had no idea how involved she is in her business. She was friendly, inviting and a true delight. Tammies desserts were wonderful but her warm personality and hospitality were equally delightful.

As a new parent I can't imagine anything worse than having  a sick baby and not being able to get in to see a Dr. I never need to worry about this with EVCC. My daughter suffered from chronic ear infections and with very little notice EVCC always saw us the same day, and in many cases within a few hours of calling. Dr. Curran is caring, professional and most importantly passionate about pediatrics. From time to time we see other practitioners in the office and ALL of them have been excellent. The office is clean and the front office staff is extremely friendly.

I came here for years and moved salons because I really disliked how they do manicures and pedicures at the same time (not relaxing AT ALL 7 Day!) Today I only needed a gel pedicure so I decided to go back. Huge mistake. Reasons: They drilled my old gels off. I asked my tech to soak them off, he said "no take to long". Let me mention there were at least 15 techs waiting for clients to stop in. Time was definitely not an issue this early weekday morning. Make an exception at a clients request. Had I come in on a busy Saturday afternoon I would have gladly understood the drill approach, I wouldn't like it but I'd understand.   He asked which pedicure I wanted I said classic with gel ($26 according the menu) , he responded with "ok $47 gel $20 more"  I responded with "ok regular polish". $47 is a very high price in my opinion for a change that was drilled off rather than gently soaked off. The price did not include callus remover, scrub etc. just your average pedi. P.s. If the classic price is $26 and gel is $20 more that's $46 not $47. The $1 is not a huge discrepancy but com'on know your simple addition.   My foot/leg massage was all leg and no foot. I think my tech was side tracked by his conversations with coworkers so he just aimlessly rubbed without paying any attention to what he was doing. But! He was so nice and friendly with me which was great. And he rubbed WAY too long. Maybe if they cut down the chin rub to less than 10 minutes they could soak gel off? Or rub my feet and not one area of my leg for 10 minutes. Just a thought.   One star is for the pedi itself it was a fine average everyday pedi you can get anywhere.  One star for my tech, he was nice and friendly with a good sense of humor.   I wanted to tell him to transfer over to Pink Polish in Chandler where prices, atmosphere and practices are more on point with what is suppose to be a pampering experience.
