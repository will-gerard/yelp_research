This is a mixed review because I really like Frys in general- I grew up in Scottsdale choosing Frys over the other groceries because it never let me down and they go above and beyond to make grocery shopping easy. But this Frys makes my previous experiences feel bad. I almost feel like I'm in Walmart when I come here. The bathrooms are never cleaned properly- and constantly out of service in some way or another. Apparently people are wrecking these bathrooms and someone isn't doing their job. The stalls are always broken, the toilet paper dispensers are broken, and always empty! As well as the sanitary tissue, and paper towels. The store cleanliness follows through out the store- the front aisles are grimy and the lines are terribly long- walked in at 9:00 this evening and the self checkout lines went back into the soda aisles, and 1 cashier was open with a painfully long line. The products are out of stock or damaged, and no one takes the time to toss the spoiled or damaged items on the shelves out. The natural food section has empty shelves every evening. The Starbucks is at a higher quality that the rest of the store should catch on to. I feel sorry for the associates that work here, they obviously are not being treated right and it falls back o the customers.

I was picking up food for co workers- 2 burgers. It was a heat recording breaking day at 117 degrees. I ordered a large cup of water with my order. DUH. I was in the drive thru line with 1 car ahead of me and it took 10 minutes..!!! When I got to the window she charged me my water as an iced tea!!!! But gave me water. I was in go big of a hurry because I was in line for to long to make a fuss... But that's not right. Won't return

I love say sushi, starting with the lunch specials- you really can't get a better lunch in Maricopa- it's a filling bento box that can be shared between 2 people. Thursday's are for all day happy hour :) The salmon sashimi is the best I have had locally before. The chef cuts the toro perfectly. I tried the bibimbap for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. A lot of food- and so good!

Beware if you are coming in for dinner. I have seen people turned away just before 9:00 who have driven from Phoenix to eat here on the way to the entertainment center on a Friday night after finding say sushi on Yelp and passing up other restaurants in Phx. (Say Sushi lists last call at 9:30). I enjoy coming in because of the good food- but when they start closing earlier and earlier it's not good service, and it's effected me more than once. Last time I dined in on a Friday night the woman asked us to close our check because the register would be closed at 9:00. Tonight really annoyed me because I called at 8:50 to place a simple To-Go order and she told me that they started cleaning up already and could not place my order. This is such bad service to me considering they would not be closing for another 40 minutes and I would not be dining in... If the owners want to post 9:30 for closing time so they can go home early then they should hire employees that will close up the restaurant after said business hours and not shut it down at 9:00. Losing interest. Hopefully Maricopa gets some better competitive restaurants soon.

SERIOUSLY?! My other half and I were craving burgers and recalled seeing a burger Resturaunt in the Biltmore the other day. I visited Zinburger expecting a no frills good ole hangout and good food... We walked in around 8pm on Friday and were "greeted" by a young brunette girl, it was the first nice night out of the season so we asked for a seat outside- she said it would be a few minutes. That immediately questioned things because the outside was less than half seated. I ran all possibilities through my head as to why she couldn't seat us right away- giving her the benefit of the doubt, while my other half wasn't so happy. We waiting for five minutes while she scattered around the front room, she finally came back and said it will be a few minutes because there are no clean tables- the tables were clean and already wiped down all that was missing were the placings. But again I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but wait! there were 7 ( I counted) waitresses/ staff standing around the kitchen entrance talking and laughing, great! She asked us for our name after all the time we had already been there and put it in her iPad, she ran off again to the back and no one cleaned the tables. She finally returned and just kept "checking" parties into her iPad. It was awkward all of the people waiting behind us waiting to be seated that even one party said " you obviously are moving in to many directions [to the hostess] can I just sit down and wait" Eventually we asked if we could seat ourselves at the table we requested outside considering it was empty and we had been waiting for 10 + minutes, she insisted the table had to be cleaned so we waited and still not an unjust soul cleaned it. Another few minutes went by and I insisted I sit down outside. Eventually menus and silver ware were brought. I was sad to find out this was a Fox concepts Resturaunt.

The best yogurt in town! It has been a long standing business compared to the others. They do banana splits, smoothies, shakes and yogurt. I also love the fact that they have added a chocolate non dairy option! And they have a good and CLEAN topping bar! Can't wait to go back...

I haven't had anything bad to say about this place- it's the only Mexican food restaurant in town that is good every time- the food is always fresh, and there are many different options (bowls, salads, tacos, burritos, nachos, fries). Love the tacos, the fresh salsa bar, and the chips. Although I haven't had the cilantros sauce for dairy reasons I've heard that it's a must have! Defiantly better than the chipotle in town.

Yum! I was so excited that they had chocolate sorbet! The sorbet flavors Zoyo had the first time I went in after the grand opening were mango and green apple, both were great but I wasn't craving anything to tart or sweet! I knew I wanted chocolate!! I was so happy to know that when I went in they had chocolate sorbet! I hope Zoyo will keep the dairy free flavors going as much as possible, it would even be great to see some new dairy free/sorbet flavors next time. A girl can dream.. In chocolate. Also, the point system is good at any Zoyo Location. I think the girl working said 1 point per dollar.. & 100 points is good for a free pint. That's a lot of yogurt, so I might have to share my phone number with my family. Very worth the late night drive in pajamas for yogurt.
