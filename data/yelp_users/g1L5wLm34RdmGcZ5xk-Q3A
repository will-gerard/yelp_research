Definately my kind of place- Diamond in the rough... Fresh seafood... and cheap beer! The food was delicious! I can't wait to go back and try that giant seafood pot!

This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Everytime that I have eaten here, everything has been delicious and the staff is very courteous. If you dont like Spicy food, this is NOT the place for you. Even the food on the menu without the pepper next to it has a little spice. My favorites are the hard chicken tacos, carnitas, and adovada short ribs. If you save enough room, you have got to try the sopapilla with ice cream. You'll thank me later.

Love... love... love this place. The decor is cute and girlie. The staff is very friendly. The mani/pedi's are flawless! Great location for a party but it could get pretty expensive.

They happily took in my large group on short notice. The food was good and the bombers are great!

My family hired the Real London Bus to help us out with transporting the fam for a family reunion.  We got the cute Pink Cheeky Bus! The driver Pat arrived early and was very helpful with taking a group photo of everyone in front of the bus. We were able to play our own music and bring beverages onboard. Overall, it was lots of fun and really fun for our relatives from out of town. I would definately recommend to friends and family!!

They almost ruined my b-day! I had a private table reserved for 10 of my friends for this last weekend. Well when the first person arrived the damn restaurant was closed! They didn't even bother to call me. Luckily, Pearl Sushi  was able to accommodate my guest. Pearl sushi 5 stars.... Bonfire 0.

I went in last Saturday to purchase a battery for my vehicle. Upon entry, we were greeted by Ed  who asked us if we had purchased the old battery from there. Of course we could not remember so we proceeded to pick out the new battery and brought to the counter. Ed then looked up our number and found out that we had bought the old one their and that it was still on warranty. My bill went from being $130 to $2.16 all thanks to Ed. Great store and honest!

I've used them for my kids birthday 2 years in a row. It was a great experience every time. The customer service is excellent from the website, to the office, to the delivery guys. The jumper was clean and fairly priced. The delivery and pick up has always been right on time. I definitely would recommend them to anyone. Be nice and tip the delivery guys, but also what they would like most is a cold bottle of water.
