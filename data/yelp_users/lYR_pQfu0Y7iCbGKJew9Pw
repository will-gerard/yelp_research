I've had two guitars setup here only to return with fret buzz, poor intonation, and an Ernie Ball replacement string in my set of premium strings because the tech didn't understand how my locking tuners worked. The shop owner also made my partner feel very uncomfortable with some of his comments towards her.

I had played two guitars the tech, Doug, had setup before going in and was surprised how great he had gotten some cheap guitars to play. Outside of this I was looking for a new tech after having a few bad setups and experiences at a shop in south Scottsdale which led me to Guitar Tree. After taking my Jaguar into get setup I'll definitely send the rest of my guitars through this shop. I can't believe how great the fretboard felt after Doug's work, plus he knew how to treat some of the common issues Jaguar and Jazzmaster bridges have.   When picking my guitar up, the owner of the shop encouraged me to play until I knew I was satisfied with the setup and also told me if I had any adjustments to be made they'd be free for the next 30 days. My setup had a three-day turnaround which was nice. I paid for a full setup plus partial fret leveling.

Is 180Q for real?! Last time I went out for First Friday I couldn't find their truck and ended up dropping $10 on a grilled cheese at another truck when what I truly wanted was 180Q's wicked brisket mac n' cheese. After walking around a bit I found 180Q parked over at monOrchid. They we're like "Yo, you guys hungry?!" and we were like, "Yeah, we've been looking for you, but we spent all our money on grilled cheese!" To my surprise, one of the gentlemen running 180Q (sorry I don't remember your name dude!) offered us a free sample of their tacos and queso AND hooked us up with some banana pudding from their friend's food truck. Again, is 180Q for real?! Yes, and they're the best.  Customer-4-Lyfe.

Ron rules. He helped me turn a cheap kit into into a great kit by teaching me about what heads to choose. I don't know much about drums, but Ron wanted to make sure I got what I wanted so he asked me many detailed questions about what I wanted the kit to sound like.

Fresh and fluffy donuts, amazing hours of operation, and an unusually nice location make this BoSa my favorite in town.
