Food has always been good. Generally we have good service. Last visit took almost twelve minutes just to order drinks. The restaurant was pretty empty at 3:30 on a Thursday. I otherwise was pleased with the service. Pollo con queso was great.

Enjoying birthday dinner with our son tonight. Our server was nice and kept up on our needs. Only minor things I would mention is that for only ordering crab legs bring butter and shell cracker out with (or before) the order. Other than that, it was a great experience.

Oh my goodness! THE...BEST white pizza around!! YUM!! And super friendly people. Their location is a good size, a little dated but that doesn't really matter. I have tried several of their pizzas, and they all are really good but always go back for their white pizza. That heavy garlic and no red sauce is PERFECT. Located in a nice strip mall. I always appreciate the quick service, and when I call in for a pick up order, my stuff is always ready and waiting for me to pick it up.

Even with all of my "littles" grown up, we are all still very big Disney and Mickey fans. One or all of us visit the Disney store, sometimes just for a couple of shirts before our Disney vacation, or gifts. Selection is generally pretty good. As with most things Disney, they can be a little pricey on certain things. Most any time we have been, always had good customer service.

I made a quick stop here to get some lunch and talk to the owner/manager. Unfortunately the manager was really rude. Opted to not have lunch there and won't bother to go back with all of the other reviews.

Where do I start? I have a serious disease, so the doctors I choose to see are very important to my health and well-being. I had an appointment with Dr Rudger, although I actually saw one of the PAs. Dr Rudger dropped in to the room to introduce herself and tell me I would be in good hands, but she didn't have anything to do with me medically. She then left the room. The PA that I met with asked me to draw up some labs, but said they would not call me, I needed to schedule to come back in and see them for results. (Another co-pay) although I didn't complain, I scheduled to come back. The following month, I actually had a visit to the ER the morning of my appointment. Unfortunately I missed my appointment, which has NEVER happened before. The following week, I got a letter in the mail that said if I ever missed another appointment, they would not see me again. I called and left two messages for the gal Lin Hoang, to let her know what happened, and offered up my discharge paperwork, so she could in fact see I had been in for emergency treatment. I never got a call back. I then wrote a letter and included my discharge document and mailed to her, and never got anything from them acknowledging they had received it. At my next visit, I was sure to let the PA know what happened and she didn't really seem to care, so I thought it must not be a big deal. Then today, several months later (and months after I chose a more professional specialist to see), I get a random letter that they will no longer see me as a patient, but if I would like their help finding another specialist, to call their office. Are these people SERIOUS?! Like I would ever do business with an office or Doctor that they refer? No way. Glad I left them months ago.  I will mention additionally too, that the pushing of sales for vitamins and supplements etc., was so unprofessional. They carry a brand of vitamins and supplements, (I am assuming they make either a kickback on, or maybe it is like a MLM thing, which they make money off of a certain number of sales, but I don't know for sure.) when they tell you that you should have vitamin B12 shots and then they will offer up these extras for additional purchase. I have yet to have a professional Doctor try to sell me things in his/office until I went to EDLCA.  There are some exceptional endos in the valley, I would highly recommend doing your homework and finding a professional Doctor and office that will actually meet your needs.

Nice establishment. Booths are nice and long so you aren't crammed into the persons arm, next to you. The menu provided a pretty decent selection. They have a lot of oyster and clam options, but I didn't try any as I don't like oysters or clams. The rest of the menu offered some great fish dishes and some steaks, salads and burgers. I opted for the king crab legs, they were hot and tasty. The sides were pretty good, although the garlic potatoes were just a bit on the dry side. Hubby got a Filet mignon. It was grilled perfect, and very good. He wasn't a fan of the cooked spinach side, but everything else was good. He enjoyed the coffee stout, and said it was nice because it didn't have an "after-bite" like some of the stouts can.  Our waiter was a 8/10. Although at first he got our drinks and then didn't return to our table for almost 10 minutes, once he came and got out order, he was much more attentive, and came to refill our drinks often. We sat and visited for quite a while, so we were sure to drop some extra tip on the table since we took up one of his booths. Overall, I was pleased with the visit. We will return again.

Good steaks. Generally little or no wait time. Good service, always make sure you are happy with your food. Good customer service, wait staff is generally attentive to needs. Food over all is a 4.5/5. Nice bar set up with lots of seats. Plenty of TVs if you want to catch a game.

Always enjoy our experience here. We like having a big menu to choose from. The staff is friendly and helpful. The restaurant is always clean and welcoming. The food is always very good. I would say 5 stars however some of the rolls are on the pricey side. But you most certainly get what you pay for. It is quality food!

I stopped by with my hubby and a business friend for lunch today. Very cute little place with lots of fun Sinatra memorabilia. It took about 10 minutes to get our drinks but we were sitting around talking when she came by the first time. After we got our drinks, it took another 15 minutes or so for them to get our order. Once our order was in, our food came out in just a few minutes. Server was very polite, and all the staff was talkative and friendly. Food tasted great, sandwiches were fresh and the wedge fries were hot and tasty. What a great atmosphere, and especially if you want to go for a little music entertainment in the evenings. I would recommend.

Always a great experience. Excellent food, great service! And the flaming turtle is exceptional for dessert!!!!! Highly recommend for your special occasion, like a birthday, anniversary, graduation. But also a great place for that first date night. (Or any date night for that matter).

LOVE the new owners of this company!! Amazing customer service. Showed up on time, specialist that looked for our pool leak was professional and efficient. Charges were very reasonable for my needs. Should the need arise, I will do business with them again any time.

Always a great experience with Arrowhead Ranch Animal hospital. I love that they have let me do payments with them in the past. Doctors are always on time and I have never felt rushed through an appointment. Like all healthcare, it can be pricey anytime our pets need  extensive vet care. That is to be expected as a pet owner. I appreciate the smiles and welcomes the moment we walk in the door.

Always a super experience at elevate. I love that they are a local company. They have a great meeting room available for a small fee, and they also (on certain nights) have some entertainment. They always are stocked up on product, and their coffee seems much fresher than some big chain stores. They have a HUGE selection of coffee and tea choices, they have alternatives for those lactose intolerant coffee drinkers too. Their breakfast/snack options are nice. A much more inviting and relaxing atmosphere with charging tables, several big longer chairs, and plenty of outdoor seating as well.

What a fantastic store. The owners are fabulous people. The selection is better than any of their competition. I love all of the flavors of oils and vinegars they have and the occasional cooking classes are a great opportunity to learn how to cook healthy and new ways to use our purchases.

I see Dr Peachy on a regular basis, as I prefer a naturopath for a disease that I have. I have seen her for over a year now. I always have a good experience. She is thorough in my appointments, has been a wealth of information in regards to my disease, and is helping me slowly transition to more natural treatment methods. I am almost always seen on time, or within a few minutes of my appointment. Everyone in the office is always helpful.

Great food. Occasionally they are pretty busy so you might have a little wait. Food usually 8 out of 10. Last time they had just a little too much sauce on the dragon rolls. Owners are GREAT people, and always friendly.

Great donuts at this little shop. We have stopped in several times for them, however most times the coffee is empty. They will brew a fresh pot though. The lunch sandwiches are exceptional. I love having a fresh sandwich for lunch on soft fresh bagels.

Always kind and friendly, however as of lately, they have had several items in their menu not be available due to lack of ingredients. Certain bagels were not available on visit, the next two consecutive visits they didn't have the lunch meats or veggies for two sandwiches we wanted to order. We certainly love this location and their food, and would love for it to be stocked up for their lunch menu.
