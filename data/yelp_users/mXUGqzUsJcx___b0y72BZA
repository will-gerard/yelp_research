What a night. The first time I tried Paisley was the night of the first Grand Ave Festival. The place was hoppin. My date and I seated ourselves and it took awhile for us to be helped. This is just one thing out of a myriad of other reasons I should only give Paisley 1 star.   They get 4 stars because the one girl who was helping us was trying to handle the entire restaurant. And we were informed the one girl cooking all the food had been doing it 12 hours straight. With this in mind, we were quite impressed by the level of service.   Another winning point was the ambiance of the place. My date remarked a number of times about how cute it is. She's right. This is a great date place. Low light, lots of art and decorations to look at, great live music to listen to, and not so loud that we couldn't carry a conversation. We had a great time.   Thank you Paisley Violin. We'll be back.

One of east mesa's hidden gems!  Very small dining area but very large portions and delicious food!  The crew behind the counter is also very friendly.  I just moved here from Boston.  I miss having a family owned diner at every corner.   If you're looking for a local place with that hometown diner feel, and you want good food, friendly service with no pretense, then Giant Hamburgers  is for you.    I had the newest addition to the menu, the breakfast burrito.  Very tasty!  I also liked how many choices I had for the ingredients in the burrito.

The sausage and egg sandwich was incredibly tasty.  I would recommend putting it on another bread.  The ciabatta is a good flavor combination but the outer crust is incredibly tough.  Impossible to eat as a sandwich so ended up using a fork.    Finding seating was a challenge during a busy holiday shopping weekend.  I think that is a testament to the popularity of the place.  The service from the gentleman who rang me up behind the counter was decent.  I was also pleased that I didn't have to wait in a line to pick up my food.  It was quickly delivered right to my table despite the crowd.

I am a little surprised by the low ratings being given so far to My Florist.  I believe no establishment should be given the full 5 stars unless everything is perfect.  When my girlfriend and I visited late one night after work, the experience at My Florist was exactly that.  The service was quick and attentive by an awesome and obviously experienced server named Jason.    The food was quick, and even though we were there late, the quality of our meals was far better than we expected.  To this day my girlfriend still says, "Hey remember that honey mustard chicken we had the other day?" It challenged our culinary expectations.  Hats off to the chef that night.  As for the low ratings, our server informed me they're well aware of the areas of opportunity they have at My Florist and are actively improving.    This place is worth a second, third, and fourth chance.  We're going to see great things from these guys in the very near future.  Thanks My Florist!

Of all the unassuming Mexican "taco stands" in Phoenix, this one takes the cake... or uh.. el pastel.. as it were.  There isn't much to write because there isn't much to this place.  So let's keep this simple.    Call ahead and order.  Pick it up.  Pay with cash.  Take it home and enjoy the food.  And enjoy it you will.  I'm a fan of the beef tacos but I'm positive you'll find something you like.  Take my advice: Get some of that red sauce.  I swear they put crack in it.  Please don't go here expecting anything more than a run down building that churns out some of the best tasting Mexican food in town.  If they wanted to deliver this food in the setting of something like Gallo Blanco they could.  But let's cut to the chase, the food is the best.  And that's all.  Thanks.

I first took my border collie mix to Alta Vista to be spayed. They took such good care of her. The staff was friendly, timely, and informative. There was an issue with the price of the medication and they worked to find me alternatives that would help bring the price down.   I then brought her back for updates on all her shots and some light grooming. I received phone calls from the doctors asking me questions and giving me information.   But Alta Vista has been great even after I moved out of town. They were kind enough to contact another kennel and provide confirmation of her vaccinations, when I was unable to locate a copy.   I highly recommend you give them a try.

I love Rancho De Tia Rosa!  The food is out of this world delicious! The expansive list of margaritas is as delicious as the food!  And the service has always been attentive, flexible, and upbeat!   And of course there's the decor! You could spend an evening just walking around the place looking at the wide variety of Mexican artifacts on display.    I would love to see the owners try a fine dining Mexican place.  They could use the exact same recipes, take the already superb service up a notch to Ritz Carlton levels, tweak the already entertaining decor ever so slightly and I think you have a formula for success!  Not that they need it!  The place was packed! Keep up the good work!

Dear The Roosevelt,  My friend and I, in town from Boston, came in to enjoy a delicious beer on the night of First Friday.  We thought this would be a big mistake.  Thank you for proving us wrong.  And thank you for proving that you are by far the superior beer drinking and food eating establishment in the downtown area.  We took it upon ourselves to steal some seats at the bar.  Despite the crowd we were given above and beyond attention by your staff, the lovely ladies behind the bar.  The beer flowed continuously and the food was quick and delectable! (Who knew you could do that to a hot dog?!)  Thanks for keeping such an impressive roster of beers on tap!   See you soon!

To quote Mr. Vincent Vega, "That's five dollars? You don't put bourbon in it or nothin?"  This was my initial reaction to the price of the eternal favorite, the Fair Trade large iced mocha which after tax fetches a solid $4.87.  I recently moved to the downtown area and I'm ready to throw my money at the local shops.  I was also hoping I'd save a little by giving up the Starbucks Fourbucks experience.  So I was a little shocked to see the price of this staple of a beverage.  But let me tell you, "This is a pretty f***ing good (iced mocha)!"   It is worth every. single. penny.  Don't take my word for it.  My punch card shows it all.  (Double punch Mondays??  Yes please.) I don't know what the secret ingredients or processes are in making this gem.  Honestly, I don't want to know.  Let's keep the magic.  On another note: Gentlemen, the last few times I've been to Fair Trade the place has been packed with the loveliest of ladies (on both sides of the counter).  I don't know if this is a marketing strategy, but it's working on me.  Good show Fair Trade! Cheers!

One visit is all it takes to know I will never set foot in here again.  And neither should you.  In no particular order:  $9 for an 8-ounce (maybe 10) pour of Red Bull and vodka.  That's price gouging plain and simple.    Way too small.  As I was walking around I kept asking, "Is this all of it?" Which made me wonder why they were admitting more people.  Where were they planning on putting them?   Turns out they hadn't thought that out at all because the place was way overcrowded.  I was baffled when I realized they were still letting more and more people in the door.  After only an hour everyone was literally packed in so tight you had to push several people out the way just to move a few feet.  This made going to the bathroom a near impossible journey, one that wasn't worth the trip. The bathroom attendant is totally unnecessary and out of place.  This place isn't upscale enough to warrant an attendant.  And if you're going to pack so many people into this place, you need more toilets.  It's simple math.  No one likes to spend their evening waiting in line to piss.  Because it was so packed, if you left the upstairs to take a piss, security wouldn't let you back upstairs to be with the people you came with.   Which brings me to the staff. The bar staff were alright.  Attentive and polite. (Just way too expensive.)  The security on the other hand were rude and aggressive.  But I can't say it's entirely their fault.    Because whoever is managing this place is clueless and clearly only interested in the bottom line.  This has an obvious effect that ripples out to the staff and patrons.     I related this story to a friend the next day and she said she wasn't surprised.  She had stopped going there as well after her roommate got into a fight with the security.    We can do better than this, Phoenix.

I've seen a few shows here and each time I've been terribly disappointed by the venue.    The bands are always top notch.  They seem to get that it's a poor venue, but in an effort to please loyal fans, they always deliver.  I feel bad for bands of such caliber as Miike Snow that have to put up with this place.    Not having A/C is a no brainer.  We're in AZ.  You pack a room full of people.  It's going to turn into a sauna.    There really is nothing to worth bragging about at The Clubhouse.  It's just  a dark room with a bar, a stage, and some sound equipment.

I rescind my 2-star vote and wish I could give them negative stars.  It is clear this is just a room designed to do one thing: make the promoters and owners money.  Wise up people.  A venue that doesn't have working AC in AZ isn't worth your couch cushion pennies.  When a credit/debit card is a chore at the bar, take your plastic elsewhere.  When the band themselves complain, you are in THE WRONG VENUE.  If you're a touring musician reading this, contact your promoter and ask to be rebooked elsewhere.  This place is a joke and it's embarrassing to the local music scene.  Don't settle for this Arizona.  We can do better.

I realize that at the time of writing this I'm still relatively new to this whole Yelp thing.  So the question I ask myself when writing this review is do I rate Philthy Phil's based on their ability as a dive bar or their ability to meet the standards of a fine upstanding establishment with all the qualities one would expect?  Yes. Dive bar. =)  As dive bars go Philthy Phil's accomplishes to both break the status quo and exemplify the title.    How they break the mold: Incredibly friendly staff and regulars. I've never felt so welcome in a dive bar in my life.  From the friendly and attractive ladies behind the bar to the man running the show in his ten gallon hat, I was made to feel right at home. "Three visits and you're a regular!" I was told.   Karaoke! There is something cozy about listening to the dregs of humanity belt out the classics.  The crowd at Phil's delivered.  I would have liked to see some more beer options. But right now this is my only complaint.  Also i hear there is a food menu on its way.  All in all Philthy Phil's is a haven from the rat race.

Some things I like, and some things I don't.    Let's start with what I think is the most important aspect of a self-described "coffee house"... the coffee.  I have had my two staples at Hob Nobs so far so this is by no means an extensive or expert opinion.  These drinks were good.  The mocha was almost $5 but I would feel more comfortable paying about 3.50.  The espresso in my Americano was pretty stinkin good.  I have to say, though, that both of these - based on taste alone - are much better over at Fair Trade. (I'm sorry. I don't know what it is.  There's just some magic drug they put in it.) This is not to say Hob Nobs is bad.  Not by any stretch.  It's good high quality joe.  And the other aspects of Hob Nobs are what make it so attractive.  Read on...  Let's talk food. After reading the previous comments I will say I could care less where the food comes from be it Costco or elsewhere. Everything I've had has been beyond delicious.  I've devoured the Plantation Chicken salad multiple times already.  The ambiance is my favorite part of this place.  There is so much room!  If you can't find a place to sit you probably haven't been to the other rooms yet.  Oh and there's outdoor seating!  The music changes from day to day ranging from just the radio to live acoustic guitar. My suggestion: Let the staff make some playlists. I predict success! =)  But the true gem at Hob Nobs is the friendly, warm, and welcoming service I've received every time I've been there.  I'm always greeted promptly and with a smile.  The staff is quick and attentive. Good show!  I wish I could give a 4.5 because I am thoroughly impressed by these guys.

This is currently the single coolest bar I have seen in AZ.  Kick ass decor.  You could pull off Awesome Dance Party here or Super Chill Out Lounge Night.  The guys behind the bar (Jeff?) were really friendly.  They actually shook my hand and asked me my name.  The owner was also behind the bar the night I was there.  He was pouring a round of my new favorite drink.  I think he called it the Linden Palmer? Clearly a take on the classic Arnold Palmer since it has a delicious sweet tea liquor of some type mixed.  To die for!  I would have had another if we didn't have to leave!  And an impressive beer list!  Anchor Steam and Dead Guy? Nice.

I heart Local Breeze!  Every time i've visited I've been greeted at the door and shown to my seat by Sid the owner.  What a class act!  The service has been nothing but top notch from all the servers I've encountered.  Kate took care of me last time.  Great job!  The food is phenomenal.  I recommend the Ahi salad, and the hummus plate to start.   But nothing rivals the lemonade mojito! Keep 'em comin!

Do you like things that are delicious?  What about things that are cool?  Or how about friendly people? You know. Cute girls/guys? Or maybe you like really tasty coffee? What about an establishment with good taste in music? No? Not into those things?  Well shoot.  I don't really know if you'd enjoy Giant Coffee then.

I firmly believe an establishment shouldn't receive 5 stars unless they are perfect.    I have tried to find some reason to knock off a star.  Maybe even label it 5 but call it 4.5. But I just can't.   This guy has it figured out.  What first struck me about Centurion is the price.  If you want to show up and drop $50 a plate, sure Chef Eric will oblige you and steer you to the lamb.  But I've never left this place and left hungry for more than $10.   His lunch selection includes paninis, salads, the best risotto I've ever had, and mind-blowing burgers.  (Zinburger? Who's that?)  Do you like wine?  Come prepared to have the perfect pairing with whatever you order.  You won't be sorry.  The service has never been short of phenomenal. Prepare to tip big.  This is my new favorite place in the downtown area.  Get here as soon as you can!

I like this place a lot. Based on my visit, plus what I'm reading in the other reviews, they've come a long way since their opening, and anyone reading this is sure to have a good experience.  The shining star of Circle H is the food! I've enjoyed The Pig, the ribs, and the half chicken with a number of different sides. The meat fell off the bones of the ribs. The spices and seasoning were on point. The sauces are a great combination but I found the ribs to do fine on their own. The chicken meat was soft and juicy and also fell off the bone. The dry rub they use is killer.   My only feedback of the food is that there's WAY too much of it. The two of us could have been filled on a single order. My suggestions? Keep the prices where they are. Cut back the portions by nearly half. Only offer a single side.   The service is during our visit was phenomenal. I wish I could remember the gentleman's name who helped us, and I hate to profile, but he was the oldest employee on the floor that night. He knocked it out of the park. Our drinks were always  full. Our table was clean.   My feedback regarding the service and staff is that when we arrived there was a small group of people sitting at a table on the patio laughing and having a good time. I was surprised to find out they were staff when one of the ladies jumped up to greet us at the door. This struck me as somewhat unprofessional. Later we found out the owner was one of the people in the group. We watched him throughout our visit sitting watching YouTube videos on an iPad while our server ran the whole place like a boss. My suggestions? If staff are on the clock have them at the ready every single second, or have them backing up the one server running the whole shop. The owner should be doing the same.  Overall I really enjoyed our dinner. We'll be back and we'll send our friends.  P.S. The reviewer RB needs to relax. Go smoke a bowl and take it easy man.

Perfection.   Read Maria M's review from 6/28. It is spot on.  I say this with no hesitation whatsoever: This is the best sandwich in Phoenix. No contest.  I've had a few of the items on the menu but I'm sold on The Phoenix. Spicy, but not too spicy. Savory, with whatever that aioli business is and the cheese.   But the hero of this sandwich is the meat and the bread. The steak is the best quality around. It's tender and juicy and there's no fight to it. Your teeth just cut right through it like soft butter. The bread is obviously thought out as well. Slightly crispy on the outside, but not so crumby that you're left with a mess. And warm and soft on the inside. The bread soaks up the sauces but doesn't become soggy. An impressive feat.  Every time I've been in there I've been greeted with a smile and attentive service.   Take the time to seek out this gem.

I really wanted to enjoy this place.   The good: The decor is fun. And the servers are so kind, and even attentive, despite the conditions in which they're forced to work. Really. They're superb. The 2 stars up there are entirely for them. To the owners: Help them help you.  And i'm afraid that's it for the positives.  The bad: Generally speaking it feels like no one is in charge or that this is the first time the owners have run a restaurant.   When you first arrive you are left to find your own seat. That works in some places, but Pallets needs a host stand and a host(ess). This will give a level of defense between the uncontrolled steady stream of customers and the overworked wait staff. It also communicates an element of control over the situation to the customers. When you tell me to sit anywhere I want, you might think it gives me some independence in my decision, but it's just forcing me to work against your broken system to find the least inconvenient seat.  Which brings me to my next suggestion: more wait staff and clearly defined sections. Each time I've been there the staff seems like they're managing the entire restaurant. And while I appreciate a team approach (much like Windsor) I never got the feeling that any one server was owning my table's experience.   The kitchen. Each time I've eaten at Pallets I've dined with a companion and each time one dish comes up significantly earlier than the other. And each time the runner had no idea who ordered what. There is clearly a timing issue in the kitchen.  The food. It's okay. I don't have anything negative to say about it but I also don't have anything really superb to say about it. I wasn't blown away. But that's okay. It' doesn't have to be amazing if the rest of the experience made up for it. But it doesn't. You can't have a disorderly restaurant and just okay food. If the food was amazing it would be worth the inconvenience. (See: The NY soup nazi, or the long wait's at Matt's Big Breakfast.)  So there's my constructive criticism. I'll try again in a few months and hope they've improved.  However I do have one ranting complaint.. the single element that absolutely drives me crazy about this place... and I can confidently say I won't be coming back until it's gone... the DJ. Why is it that every time I just want to go have a nice piece of sushi I have to feel like I'm in a night club? I could barely hear my friend speaking to me. And why would I want to relax in a hammock with a DJ blaring into my ear five feet away? I don't get it and I don't like it. Save the restaurant some money and just play some music over the house PA.

This just might be the one place in Arizona where espresso is treated with more reverence than any other. Do come here for the most delicious espresso you've ever had. Don't come here for the traditional experience of wifi + comfy couches + caffeinated drinks. Bill has made sure to strip away any potential obstacles between you and the espresso you deserve. Trust him and his menu. But be forewarned: This will surely ruin all other coffee shops for you.a
