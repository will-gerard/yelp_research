I've been going for a year now and finally decided to get serious about my workout goals. So I expressed my hopes to management and they were quick to jump on board and help me achieve my goals. The club manager was absolutely amazing in helping me with getting a personal trainer. And Dominic was also amazing l, he did my assessment, he was very personable and made it easy to feel comfortable in my first session with an instructor. The staff is absolutely amazing and are eager to help you achieve your goals.

I absolutely love and support chick fil a and was please to hear they would open one by me. But since they have opened I have had nothing but problems, atleast on their drive thru. The first time I let it go. The second time I called to let them know, then the second time I was put on hold while an employee talked with another employee on how there was a complaining costumer in the line. At that point I was livid. Hung up and wrote a complaint on their website. Finally of weeks of not going there I finally decided to try it again and once again I was disappointed. The food is great it just seems like their costumer service sucks. There is no difference now from that place and mcdonalds next door
