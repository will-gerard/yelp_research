This is one of Phoenix's hidden gems! It is family run and you can tell. The food is great and the service is as well. Juans is one of the few traditional Mexican joints left. I highly recommend checking it out. Try the green chili!

This is my first visit. We stopped for lunch and were pleasantly surprised. It is a beautiful restaurant tucked in the corner with a large menu. We both had lunch dishes and the portions were very large and delicious.  I would recommend giving them a try.

Great shop! They are always willing to answer questions and help out any way they can. They carry used equipment. Chris answers emails quickly. They do workshops on the weekends to teach you how to so some things yourself. Couldn't ask for anything more. Don't forget to sign up for their emails.

Great service, good food, good seating. Just a little pricey.  I will return but 2 of us spent $75.

Great staff! They always take time to talk to me and make sure all my questions are answered. I did a lot of research and I feel I chose very wisely. I highly recommend them if you ever need them.  (HOPEFULLY NOT)

Overall not impressed. My chile rellano was really greasy and the guy cooking was touching everything with the same gloves he was making the food with. I thought the portion was a little small for the price.

Service was ok. Tacos were great but small.  The first set of chips were rancid :(

Great BBQ! The homemade sauces were great but the meat stood on its own. The pulled pork was fantastic! The rub has just the right spice. The Mac & cheese is a yummy compliment to any meat choice. The kids loved the pulled chicken sliders which they dipped in the sweet sauce. The street tacos were great as well.  I highly recommend you give this joint a try. Hek yeah is my new goto for all things smoked. They obviously take pride in their flavor profiles. Winner, winner brisket dinner!

I gotta say I was expecting more from reading the previous reviews. We got the nachos which were quite large and had a very generous portion of guacamole but were just kinda boring. The Mac and cheese was a big let down. A small step up from velveeta :( The service started out fine but once we didn't order anything from the bar our server disappeared only to deliver our meal and then our check, nothing more. Bummer, I live right by here but I probably won't become a frequent visiter.

This theater has the best seats of any theater I have ever been to. The theater itself is very nice.  It's my new go to.
