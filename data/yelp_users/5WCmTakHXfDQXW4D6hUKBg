Overrated. Service was slow, food was mediocre and a bit pricey for the service/food you get. I had satay chicken and the meat was dry and the sauce was crumbly. Then I ordered the pad-see-ew and it was super salty.

I love this place. All items on the menu are worthy to try them. My favorite one is the Koko (biscuit with fried chicken). The service is a bit slow but they are so sweet and cool that who cares?

Great ambiance, simple yet elegant menu, and consistent service and food. I visit Cyclo every other week and it's always a pleasant experience. Plus, to converse with the owner, Justina, is a delight. Witty, fashion and fabuchic!

Amazing ambiance, gigantic and delicious pastries, and very welcoming atmosphere. Staff members are super nice, and the art exhibits are always a nice plus to the space. Their BLT is one of the best BLTs I ever had.

The only good thing about this place is the service. Staff and waiters put a lot of effort in serve you the best they can. The main problem here is the food. For the price you are paying, I rather recommend you to go to a mediocre buffet like Golden Corral. Food did not look well, and did not taste well. In top of that, the over the top decor (almost Disney World-like) is overwhelming. They use "Brazilian" on their name but the only Brazilian element is the meat service at your table everything else is cheap-buffet food.

Just had their ramen burger, cauliflower soup and their fingerling potatoes and I'm leaving with a huge smile. Great food, creative whimsical dishes, and superb service.

Overpriced. I spend almost $20 for two regular burritos and two drinks. The burrito was dry, cold,  and the tortilla was hard and flavorless. Trash cans full of trash made it impossible to use. I would never go again.

This is the kind of place that every time I have people from out of town, I'll take them there and I know they will love it. The ambiance is really nice, it reminds me of Austin's unique restaurants. Food is excellent, service is consistent and their Mushroom, walnut and spinach soup is to die for. Highly recommended!

Great location, rude staff, and the item I ordered was not only terrible, but cold (Lavosh Pizza). In top of that, after five minutes into the food, they gave us the check, like rushing us out. I've been to other locations and the items I've  ordered were better, but the staff is usually rude and careless.

As a Puerto Rican who lived in the island for 26 years and who cook Puerto Rican food on a weekly basis, I have to say, hands down, that Millie's Cafe is a great option for those interested in authenticity. The staff is really sweet, they make you feel like home. I had their alcapurrias, mofongo and sandwich cubano, and everything was amazing. The only critique is that they don't accept credit cards. Besides that, Millie's is a great option for those who are looking for authentic flavors from the Spanish Caribbean.

The problem here is the staff. They are simply rude and very unprofessional. For example, I had an issue while entering the gate -it never opens- and I forgot to pick the receipt. The employee, who saw me struggling with the gate, refused to gave me a deodorant for my car because I failed to grab the receipt. In top of that, they always forgot to give you the wipes to clean the interior of your car. Oh, and one more thing, bring a towel, because the time under the blower is not long enough to dry it.

Staff is super nice, and the pocket sandwiches are really good -a bit small tho- I LOVE their kale salad: the best in town!

Sounded yummy: too bad they have us waiting 8 minutes on the phone and then the call just ended. A world of unfulfilled promises!

Really nice place, great outdoor space and excellent service. Their ahi tuna tacos are above and beyond. Be sure to try their orchata, really good. My critique will be to be more consistent with the side dishes method of preparation. They never tasted/looked the same.
