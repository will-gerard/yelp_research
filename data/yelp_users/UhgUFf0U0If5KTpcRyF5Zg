This place is awesome.  I'm a total girl and lacking in bike repairing ability.  Hell, I didn't even realize that bikes need maintenance.  Whoops.  Anyhow, they've tuned up my bike and fixed several flats for me.  I suck at cleaning/oiling my chain, but Eric takes care of me.  Everyone is super nice and knowledgeable, but I'm partial to Eric.  They've also ordered a bike rack for me and helped me install it, because obviously I am no good with manual skills....  I will definitely be back when I need to purchase another bike.

I just moved here from Kansas and have been looking for a good BBQ joint.  We ordered the lunch special, which was a choice of a beef or pork sandwich with coleslaw and fries. We also got an order of rib tips. The food took forever, and there were only two other couples there. The  sandwich was tiny and served on a regular hamburger bun. The fries were average, and the coleslaw had zero flavor. The rib tips were cold inside. When I told the waitress, she apologized and said that they come frozen. She said that they get steamed before coming out.  I couldn't believe that a BBQ restaurant would have frozen meat. WTH?  This place was so disappointing.  I will not be coming back.

This place is awesome for happy hour. We had the wave roll (spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber, soy paper), crunchy crab roll, crab special roll, and calamari. Everything but the wave roll was delicious and the bill was about $20. You can't beat that!

Crap service.  I hate when I go to a Mexican joint, and they never refill your drinks or chips.    I went on a Saturday night, and it was semi-busy.  Our food came out quickly, but the waitress never came to check on us.  I shared an chimichanga meal with the boy, and it was very small for being $10.  The menu does not have a lot of selection, either.  I finished my margarita and  the waitress dropped off the check without asking if I wanted another.  I was planning on drinking more and getting dessert, but decided to bail after the poor service.

I was so excited to see this show. $135 per ticket, so I was expecting to be wowed. Nope. His show was really hokey, David seemed to be a little mean when interacting with guests, the "magic" wasn't super impressive. The only good thing was that it was an intimate venue, and you could see everything easily. I miss Siegfried and Roy!

This is a bad, sketchy location with old rooms. The staff is very nice, though. I've stayed at newer Residence Inns, and they are so much nicer.  They only give you two towels. The tub is old; too scary to take a bath in.  Breakfast was not ready at 6:15 when it opened at 6:00.  Bed and pillows are super uncomfortable!  It's located next to 1-17 and can be very loud. Blah.

Terrible little shit-hole.  I've flown Allegiant four times in the last six months and have had a terrible experience each time.    The last time I flew out of there, they said that my name has been flagged and they needed to contact Homeland Security.  It took about an hour on the phone to get me cleared.  Whatever.  On the flight back, the same thing happened, but they pulled me out of line, and it was mortifying.    So, today's flight had me popping my Xanax even before boarding my flight.  I was escorting my handicapped mother back to Wichita and was returning on the same day/plane.  We arrived at the airport at 6:25 for our 7:35 flight.  As i was walking through the doors, the ticket agent was screaming for all Wichita departures.  I made it to the back of the line and informed her that I was Wichita bound.  She yelled at the line of people in front of me to make room for me to get up there.  I get a lecture from her and was told that I WILL miss my flight for being late and that I better "hustle it" through security.  I make it to the security line, and there was not a single person in line.  I unloaded my bags and shoes and waited for some instruction, as my mother was in her wheelchair.  The TSA agent sees me and yells, "You can't push her through there."  No shit.  He calls for a female escort and off she goes.  I get the stop signal from him, and then he motions for me to go through.  No beep.  I'm wearing a tank top with a tissue-cotton cardigan over it.  He tells me to take it off and send it through the machine.  What a perv.  I make it pass the x-ray and meet up with my mother again.  The agent searching her goes into ripping me a new one about how I should really arrive earlier and it's "not fair to rush" my mother through this.   1.  I was not late.   2.  My mother was completely fine and had no complaints.    Ok, finally get to the boarding area.  I waited patiently until everyone was boarded and went up to the line.  This ticket agent also scolded me for not being here two hours early and said that we are holding up the flight.  She radioed for someone to help with a wheelchair assist.  Some girl comes up and pushes my mom to the tarmac.  I could've done that.  I see that there are still about 20 people waiting in line to board from the back of the place.  Don't make me feel badly about escorting my disabled mother and  say that I'm making them run late when there were still people boarding,  Then they called for some weird dolly for humans that reminds of when Hannibal Lector was being transported.  Allegiant used this for my mom last time, and it was horrible.  There were so many straps and she was uncomfortable.  Also, my mom is in an ankle boot and couldn't stand.  I told them I would rather carry her, as she is only 80 pounds.  They acted all inconvenienced.  I carried her onboard and placed her in her seat with no problems.  Why was I given so much grief?  I can't imagine how my poor mom would've been treated if I wasn't there.  I'm an adult, do I really need to be treated like a child and chastised about everything?

Another day, another dental emergency. I have a second home here, but my primary is in Kansas. I've been through the horrible, wake-you-up-in-pain experience before to know it's root canal pain. I called them this afternoon, and they got me in. The office is very nice and cozy, and they have the best sweet snacks in the lobby! I'm obviously big on aesthetics, and the office is nice and shiny. That's enough to win me over. The staff is quite friendly, and the doctor got me all situated. In and out, easy-peasy!!

I agree with Albert about the Recession 'bailout" menu not really being a bargain.  I had the Uncle Sam's Italian Special.  The sandwich was a 1/4 club for $4.  They stuffed it with a lot of toppings, and it was hard to close the sandwich.  It was also dripping with some kind of oil/dressing, so it gets all over your hands.    The service is not good.  I've been here twice, and both times my drink was never refilled.  That's a huge pet peeve, as I am a camel and need to stay hydrated.

The name of this place is deceiving. It's upscale, fine-dining, candle-lit, and a hip feel.. It reminds me of Houston's Steakhouse. The server was kinda air-heady, and service was slow. The shrimp cocktail was standard, but the shrimp was huge. Wedge salad was good. It was a chunk of iceberg with all the dressing on top and bacon, bleu cheese. Spinach salad had goat cheese, fresh walnuts and strawberries. It wasn't as good as Houston's, but not bad. On to the good stuff: I had the Seafood Sirloin. Perfect steak with scallops, asparagus, and mixed vegetable (mushrooms, peppers, and squash.) There was a lobster claw that was cracked. Sooo good. My sis got steak and a half lobster. It was a full pound. Excellent restaurant!

Starbucks are usually pretty standard service/coffee, but today I stopped in to use my free birthday reward. These expire ONE day after your birthday. I didn't know, but the cashier was lovely enough to give it to me anyhow. I truly appreciate the guest service!

Bad. Real bad. I got a mani/pedi. They had one person for each. I can see why people get annoyed when they don't understand the language. I speak the language, and they were talking all kinds of shit!  The lady who did my nails was real snarky and didn't do a good job.  My nails were smudged, and my cuticles are a mess. The dude who did my pedi was awesome though. He rubbed and massaged for at least 10 minutes.   I wish there were good, white folk who do nails. Lol.

This place is great! I've never been a fan of froyo, but this stuff is tasty! I tried the skinny strawberry and topped it off with mango, strawberries, blueberries, and Fruity Pebbles. I got the quart size (yeah, i was asking for a tummy ache, but it was worth it.) I love how it is self-serve, and you can pile whatever you want on there. It's a bit pricey at 39 cents/ounce, but if you go to their website you can print a buy one get one free coupon.

Yup, still love this place.  I've been to four other fro-yo places since then, and they pale in comparison.  Mojo's is great because they have good customer service, fresh and plentiful toppings, and quality frozen yogurt.  I got the new flavor of pomegranate, root beer, and  passion fruit today with  kiwi and fruity pebbles.  It was the best $5 that I spent!  I just love that everything is fresh and you always see the staff cutting up fresh fruit.  I think that this location is nicer than the City North spot in regards to staff and selection.

I love this shopping area. The stores are unique, and it is such a beautiful area. The palm trees are lit up every night, and I could just sit and stare for hours.

I do enjoy my FRC restaurants.  They're all so hip and cool-looking.  I had the Sam burger, which the special of the week.  It was bacon and two types of cheese.  The burger was huge, juicy, and oh-so-flavorful.  I am a glutton for punishment and also ordered the apple pie shake and banana cream pie.  Man alive, that stuff is GOOD!  The banana cream pie is made daily and has huge chunks of bananas, and the crust is perfect.  The shake is as the name states, and tastes like the pie in liquid form.  As you can guess, I left the place with a food gut!

Surprise!  A Vietnamese restaurant in Surprise.  I ordered bun noodles with beef/lemongrass to go.  I waited at the bar, and the service was great.  The owner sat next to me and had a plate of spring rolls.  I made a comment on how tasty they looked, and he asked if I wanted one.  I think that's when I knew I loved this place.  Anyhow, I got home and tasted my food.  Awesome.  The noodles were cooked perfectly (not soggy), and there were plenty of veggies and meat.  The nuoc mam had a lot of flavor as well. (You can have really good food, but if you have crappy nuoc mam, your food won't taste right.)  I think I'm gonna have to start ordering to-go weekly.

This place is terrible. We had them clean our condo while we were away. The place wasn't dirty,  we just wanted it professionally cleaned. They left dirty dishes in the sink, didn't scrub the tub, and didn't wipe out the refrigerator like we requested. We will never use them again.

We will never use them again.  12/23/15: I've updated this review and have given them another star. The owner contacted me and tried to make things right. They offered to reclean our place, but since we're not in town often, we opted for a refund. I really appreciate that they did try to fix things.

This is the best place I've been to! Most places I've been to love to talk shit in Vietnamese (yes, I can understand you!) They were very friendly and professional. The standard pedicure came with a great calf/foot massage and hot stones. My toes and hands look awesome. It's my new favorite place.

This place is a bit of a hole in a wall, but I'm keen on those. Their prices are great. My pho was $7, and I don't feel that pho should ever be more than $9. Those places that are priced high aren't usually authentic. Pho was really good, and believe me, I'm a pho connoisseur. The bowl was huge and was enough for two. The soft noodles with beef has great flavor with a bit of spiciness. It has fresh carrots, broccoli, bamboo shoots, and onions. This is definitely my favorite place in the valley!

Only in Vegas! My puppy came with me to Vegas for a conference, and I chose a pet-friendly hotel. Well, puppies and the strip don't mix. This resort is only located a mile from where I was staying and so extremely beautiful. I was nervous about boarding my dog, as he has never been away from me and also suffers from megaesophagus and requires extra care. The owner was very accommodating and sweet with out boy. The facilities are immaculate and does not have the dog boarding-sterile smell. Our dog had so much fun and made new friends. I couldn't have asked for a better place.

I came in with a party 12 without reservations and had no problem getting a table. We received excellent service and food. We had popovers, which were amazing and they gave you the recipe. We also tried the tuna tartare, shrimp cocktail, and mussels. I had the bone-in ribeye, one of the best steaks I've had. I added the turf option of crab, but it was very salty and dry. It's a great go-to for steak.

I'm a snowbird and love this place. It is the perfect location and so close to Kierland Commons and Scottsdale Quarter. The amenities are amazing (free tanning, lounge area, movie room, spinning classes, chef nights, etc.) My largest complaint is parking though. Our condo comes with a garage spot, but guest parking is impossible! And it sucks being an owner due to all the maintenance :/

Those tiny Asian women are strong! I think this was the best massage I've ever had.  The spa is quiet and clean, and obviously relaxing. I may have accidentally sex moaned halfway through ;)

I used to go a lot at the old Scottsdale location. The new location just doesn't feel right; it's way too fancy!  It feels like a hip restaurant with the light fixtures and flooring. I liked going before it became a big franchise. The service is terribly slow; it took almost 30 minutes for our food to arrive. The gizzards were very bland, and the batter had no flavor. I also has the 3-piece chicken meal with 2 waffles. The chicken was very greasy and not crispy. One of my pieces of chicken was red inside.  (There is a photo!) The waffles are the reason why I come, and they're totally different now! They weren't sweet and soggy instead. I am so disappointed that this place sold out.

I've been here twice in two days of that means again. The staff is super friendly, and the food is made when you order. It's a fast-casual place, but feels like full service. The gyro and chicken pita is stuffed full and tasty. Greek salad is a bit plain, so skip it. Fries are yummy, though!
