If you've eaten at Pizzeria Bianco, you already have an understanding of how much care and attention the folks at Pane Bianco will give to your sandwich. Today's market sandwich was filled with textured goat cheese, roasted tomatoes, and arugula -- delicious. Each sandwich comes with a small piece of candy for dessert (which, if you're like me, you'll eat on the way out the door).   While the sandwiches are great, here's the beauty of Pane Bianco -- you can purchase loaves of the house bread served at Pizzeria Bianco for $3 each. I've never had better bread than this. Period. I'll be picking up a loaf the next time I make Nigella's trout pate (http://www.notquitenigella.com/2008/01/22/smoked-trout-pate-from-nigella-express/).

I hate to give a 1-star review, but Manuel's earned it. Having lived in Albuquerque for six years, I know how a chile relleno should look when it arrives at the table. Manuel's batter was heavy on the egg and what we found on the plate was, unfortunately, an omelet with green chile. Disgusting.

I do indeed love Apple products. I bought my first Apple computer -- a little iBook -- in 2002 when I began grad school. I bought a 2nd generation iPod, too (it was as heavy as a brick). I'm not going to lie, this commercial sold me on giving Apple a try:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GxC4kKD9qA  Still, that doesn't change the fact that the computer successfully carried me through my master's degree. I'd have to check, but I think my diploma was made out to "iBook" rather than "Chad."  This particular Apple store is great; not only does it sell amazing products, but I've never had a problem getting a faulty device replaced. I once had an iPhone die on me and they simply handed me a new one. Also, I brought a 3-year-old laptop in hoping for a free fan repair; they couldn't waive that cost, but they did go the extra mile and look into my battery while they were at it, then replace it. Yes, it sounds like I've had a lot of faulty Apple products, but when I think about how many purchases I've made here, I think it's par for the course (especially when I think about my disastrous experiences with Dell and HP).  I'm bringing my Macbook Pro into the Apple Store today in the hopes they'll be able to take care of a stuck pixel or two; it's annoying to try to watch a movie with a stationary white spot on the screen, especially when the cost of this computer is the reason I still have no dishwasher in my house!

If you're like me, you go to Chuy's for:  -cold Dos Equis on tap. -tortilla soup when you're feeling under the weather. -free salsa and tortilla chips.  Overall, I enjoy this place quite a bit, especially since it's only a mile or so from my house. If there's one thing on the menu to avoid, it's the burgers...they're often overcooked, and I find it odd that the cheese for cheeseburgers is served shredded and on the side.

Delicious sliders for a great price. Also, it's just a few blocks from work. Also, eating there makes me feel manly. Enough said.

I can't recommend The Cheesecake Factory. When you flip through the menu, you'll see why -- it has too much variety. Variety sounds like a good thing at first, but you've heard the phrase "Jack of all trades, master of none," right? The Cheesecake Factory is worse than a typical chain restaurant, it's a chain restaurant that has no focus or mission. It's a restaurant that, because of the sheer numbers of dishes it serves, can't possibly concentrate on any of them long enough to make them well.  On a menu like this, choice is more a crap shoot than an opportunity.

I moved to Phoenix a month or two ago and this was the closest sports bar that a) had delicious wings and b) was willing to let me watch hockey on the big HD screen.   They have daily food and drink specials and some especially great $5 deals on the weekend.   I'm addicted to chicken wings and The Dirty Drummer delivered. I'd recommend you spend an extra buck and a half on the grilled wings (but ask for some hot sauce on the side).   I'll never turn down an invitation to The Dirty Drummer, especially during hockey season!

What can I say that hasn't already been said a dozen times? Sweet potato fries -- delicious. Aioli - worth every  calorie.   I had the Delux burger and though I would have liked a bit more bleu cheese, it was a damn good burger. You might get the same result at home, but only if you have time to grind your own beef and grow your own arugula.   I tried the Papago Orange Blossom beer...not bad, but soft; it was a bit too similar to what the eight year olds are selling at the lemonade stand down the street from my house.  Finally, the restrooms were clean and candle-lit. It's the kind of restroom you'd see in one of those late-night, Showtime movies.   I'll go back to Delux in a month or two, but I'll probably order from the to-go menu rather than pulling up a stool.

I can think of nothing I enjoy more for lunch than a well-crafted, hot sandwich. Bertha's sells a mean panini, and I can't bring myself to order anything but the one that features asparagus. It's that good. My wife surprised me with the asparagus panini on Valentine's Day, and it was the perfect gift.  For those of you who like sweets, this place has some fantastic cookies and dessert bars.

This place is great. I began bringing my son to the Children's Museum when he was 2, and he still loves it at 4. My friends have had a bad experience or two with parents who weren't supervising, but I haven't run into any problems at all.  My son's favorite room right now is the fort room on the 2nd floor. They did it up right. Our tip is to get there as soon as the museum opens -- you'll have the fort room to yourself and you won't have to share your creation right away. Also, they have a few really great books about imagination and fort building in that room.  Just like a few of the other reviewers, we're on our 2nd or 3rd yearly membership, and it's well worth the money. We let our zoo membership lapse, but wouldn't dream of doing so with the Children's Museum.

I can't say that ATS has the best carne asada I've had in Phoenix, but the atmosphere and the patio make for a great evening. What's more, the bean and cheese burrito is pretty fantastic. I've also had their breakfast burrito a few times; you might want to ask for an extra side of salsa.  The best part of ATS -- the staff is friendly and chatty. I was glad they placed a tip jar near the register.   If you've ever visited Houston, you'll understand what I mean when I compare happy hour at ATS to happy hour at Mission Burrito. The food couldn't be more different, but that atmosphere is quaint and enjoyable.

Other than highlighting some of the excellent side dishes, I'm not sure what I can add to the other excellent reviews. The collard greens are frackin' fantastic, and I order them every time. My Baby Mama likes to order the fried okra, which she raves about at the most random times (playing disc golf, watching Dr. Who, playing euchre). I also tend to order the home fries, though I've had to deal with an underdone potato or two.  My father-in-law was in town last weekend and wanted to treat us to fried chicken. We suggested Lolo's. WARNING -- read on only if you feel very little empathy for others. Otherwise, the next sentence might break your heart...OK, ready? He showed up with a bucket of KFC. Sadness.  Last word? Lolo's has the best chicken and most complimentary side dishes in Phoenix, hands down.

I recently discovered Zipp's and it's now my favorite place to watch a game while lesson planning. The burgers are pretty good, but the wings are outstanding. Great specials most of the evening.
