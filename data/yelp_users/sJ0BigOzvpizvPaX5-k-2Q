The apartment is older but it is in a great location. Staff is friendly and attentive to tenants needs.

The person who answered the phone when I called needs to seriously brush up on her customer service skills.

This place is delicious and the customer service is amazing. One of the owners came to our table to introduce himself and gave us two shots and yummy dessert.

If you're looking  for a slim,  strong sculpted dancer's body, tenpoint5 is the place to be. I took a class with JoAnne as the instructor, I found the workout challenging and rewarding.   JoAnne was friendly and engaging. Being new to Barre, she made me feel comfortable from the moment I walked in.
