it is hard to find good help... My husband and I have been going here for over a year... we are both in the food service industry, he's a chef & owner to a local Burger Joint and I am a server... Z has ran into a problem finding reliable staff... we know this is difficult because my husband and I have BOTH been on both sides of this coin and well... simply... it sucks... Z's might not be able to find reliable staff... but she sure NEVER has a problem with her food... Z sources some of the most flavorful starts to all her dishes... sometimes she sources straight from her own garden... This action  is one of Love... please know that you might run into an issue with 'service'... however don't be afraid to ASK for more water rather than complaining about not getting it... I would hate to see this place go out of business, the food is sublime and Z is one heck of a gal... keep it up mama... you will come out on top... so in closing... head over to Z's and enjoy a wonderful meal at a calm, loving pace... and ENJOY THE LOVE

Wow... "...This thing could be nationwide" Steve says to me... in between shovels of warm, gooey jalapeno corn bread... and boy has he hit the nail on the head... The staff; informative, engaging, entertaining bunch of 'my kind-ofs'.  All I have to say is go... if you're a vegetarian? GO... if you're a meat eater? GO... something out-side-the-box? Go go go.

Okay... I don't usually write reviews... if something is good, I just tell my peeps and thats it... HOWEVER... I can't keep this one in...  there is too much to talk about... so, I will just touch on the most important... FOOD and service... both of which get a 5 star from me... I've been a vegetarian (eating fish sometimes) for about 7 years now and happy about it... so, at the chefs suggestion I tried the Grilled Heirloom Cauliflower... WHAT, WHAT, WHAT was I tasting... Jimney Cricketts!!! Queso Manchego and a cumin eggplant puree... ohhhhh my!!! you know when a kid does the pee pee dance, hopping from one foot to another... wooooooowhooooo that's what this feels like... AMAZING...   now, I said to my husband... who was busy happily munching away on Crispy Pig Ear Pad Thai... I think I want to try that Tuna thing... The Bigeye Ahi Crudo... Of course he said... without even looking up from his Pad Thai... when the tasty little morsels arrived at the table, I had to take a minute to enjoy the beautifully prepared plate... LISTEN... I never did understand the point behind plating... until now... a decadently cut tuna lay nestled on my plate with with a brightly colored, velvety avocado mousse... tangelo gel√©e...ginger and shallot confit...pistachio dust...Serrano chili... PARTY IN MY MOUTH!!! I had to copy the ingredients from the menu because my mouth couldn't explain what was happening in there!!!   moving on... now...the Roasted Bone Marrow shows up to the table... I have to admit... my curiosity got the best of me... I HAD TO... but wait... I'm a vegetarian... let's google that and see just what I'm getting into... vitamins... minerals... yada yadas ... okay... I'm tasting it... OHHHHH MYYYYYY GOODNESS... just a little taste... but between the lamb bacon...onion jam... and this ridic crostini... i might need another... and wow... wow... wow...  I can continue to gush... but I need to stop there... to say a quick thing about the service... between the Chef/Owner Chris... Bar manager/Owner Adam... and our server... we felt like we were regulars at the local... My husband and I were not dressed for a 5 star restaurant... However... we got the 5 star treatment!!! THANK YOU THANK YOU to all of you at The Local.... you guys rock... we will see you again

It's really really sad... here we sit... tonight my family and I wanted Mexican... and figured we would try out the new joint in the hood... mistake... let's start with me... The black bean burger... GREAT flavor... however... it fell apart... when I took the bun off to place the burger back on , the bun... I realized it was stale!!!! Annnnnnd there was a quarter size squirt of chipotle mayo... sad...so sad... when I told the server...  "sorry about that"... she was sweet for sure... she just didn't have that "let me take care of you attitude"... listen... im a server myself... I would bend over backwards for a guest... my daughter had street tacos... ummmm don't waste your time... my husband had the green chili burrito.... veeeeeery disappointing... how can you get this stuff wrong?  This is all basic Mexican recipes... stale chips overly salted... my fries?  I'm almost sure they are frozen...  and the cherry on top... my husband is of the by gone era of "finish everything in your plate"... hes still eating, I refuse to eat crap and obviously my children are following suit... and the server asks (after my drink has been empty almost the whole meal) do we want refills... I say "no, we are all finished" and she replies "okay, shall I bring you the check?" ... young lady, my husband is still downing food... check? Jimney cricketts!!! She is definitely not trained properly... ummm honestly... I screw up as a server from time to time... I also try to make it right... this one... didn't get it... I'm sorry if she reads this... but more training is needed... oh on top of that... KNOW YOUR MENU!!! 56$  meal and we will NEVER go back!!!

I wish I could give it more stars... I had high hopes... maybe it's an off day... however... my coffee was lukewarm... Actually it wasn't a coffee it was a latte (tasted like a watered down dunkin coffee)... I figure the best way to test a new coffee shop is by ordering a latte and a scone, if they have one, my luck they had both! Would you like that warm? he asked (thinking back now he might have meant the latte)... Why of course I do! I was excited at this point... They also had coconut milk! I love love love a creamy yummy frothy coconut milk latte! Of which they did not have here... my son got the Indian chai tea iced which was delicious (from concentrate im sure) that's why I gave it 2 stars... However my latte was terrible! Two sips and i couldnt even finish it... just the thought of a third sip made me mad for spending the 12$ I had spent... dont get me started on the 'fresh (warmed) pastry'!  There is NO WAY this is made inhouse THAT IS WHAT FRESH MEANS!  I'm so disappointed...  oh so sad!
