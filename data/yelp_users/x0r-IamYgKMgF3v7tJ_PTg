i am SO glad we decided to try this place on a sunday night!  they were a bit busy and there was about a 15 minute wait-but it was well worth it. the service was amazing, the sushi was awesome, and my yakisoba with tofu was so yummy. portion size is great-plenty of leftovers. will be returning there very shortly!

I can't say enough good things about Martin's-I first found them through yelp reviews when I desperately needed brakes on my saturn. they were helpful, reasonable, and had them done the same day. recently, I brought my car in again  last week to get it in shape to pass emissions-my tags were seriously expired and the check engine light had been on for a few months. glen kept me informed on everything that needed to be done, had the needed part rush delivered, got me a temporary tag, AND took my car down to emissions for me. it of course passed and my 10 year old car runs better than ever! i would recommend them to anyone needing a reliable, knowledgeable, and reasonably priced mechanic

there is one problem with bagel nosh: it's not close enough to tempe! went there on a sunday a little before closing-the bagel selection was sparse but they offered to get us any kind of bagel we wanted. the garlic,feta, and dill cream cheese was amazing and the breakfast sandwich looked hella yummy! went to get a refill on our way out and the owner offered a free large glass of iced tea since they were about to close. the service was great andi might have to make the trip out there very soon!

found this through yelp on a night where we just wanted to sit,relax, and have a iittle food and i'm SO happy we did! we came in around 9, sat in the bar area, was served right away, and got amazing service. the hummus was good but since they were out of their usual variety, our drinks were comped. we ordered potato skins, which had chipolte sour cream and were delightful! i can see going back to try their regualr menu- it is contemporary american food, but what's so worng with that every once in a while???

i do so love pita jungle! i usually get the mediterranean platter, which is enough to share and has a bit of everything on it. a few times i've gone they've been out of falafel but are more than happy to subsitute. the chicken lavosh pizza is also amazing. this location doesn't have the usual servers named "starflower" or "rainforest" and i like that. the leftovers are always good as well- a definite plus in my book!

we went here for a belated birthday party and i only have two complaints: it was "hip hop" night and they only played new songs and they don't let you have hats or cell phones on the rink. i realize the 2nd thing is a safety issue but seeing as though there were people racing past us, i think my hat would have been fine. for the money, it's great time and a great workout-i definitely enjoyed myself and will go back

i am revising my review of back east and embarrassed to be duchess of this place. i first loved this place because of their vanilla half and half. that was until one day, when coming near closing time, i realized it was fat free vanilla coffeemate! their service continues to go downhill- how many times to i need to get attitude from someone before i decide that einstein's is actually better?  last time we went, they were out of ice and soda, yet my friend was sold a cold cup with no argument. we have changed our weekly bagel brekkie to bagel nosh- i'd rather drive to awahtukee and have someone be happy i'm dining at their restaurant and have decent sandwiches-other than the veggie sandwich, back east fails miserably,imo. i hope someone that works here and/or management reads this and realizes that they pretty much just lost 3 of their best customers..

it gets two stars instead of one because the burgers were actually decent. other than that, it's your usual douche-y sports bar and the bar staff has the worst attitude+ can't pour a decent draft beer. i could understand the guinness i ordered but a fat tire shouldn't have that much foam EVER. i actually prefer bogey's over this place..

if i could give a zero star review i would- i can't even review the actual services because i never got that far. called at 2pm on a saturday to see if they had any appointments available and was put on hold for TEN MINUTES- someone kept picking up the phone and putting me back on hold. finally a different person answered and asked if i been helped and when i mentioned how long I had been on hold she put me back on hold! she came back a few seconds later to tell me that they had nothing that day  but I could make an appointment for monday- when I said no and  asked why it took so long to figure it out, she hung up on me. I ended up going to the target optical at christown, which was an awesome experience

i guess i'm the only person that didn't enjoy this museum but i guess my standards are a bit higher. if you came with kids, the gold panning would probably be fun but seeing as i truly enjoy natural history, i found 99% of the museum to be less than educational. "dinosuar mountain" seemed cheap, as did the animatronics that went with it. the jail and gold panning section seemed meh. i do think it would be great for kids and it's a decent price, but i'll skip it next time..

the beer was good and  it was a beautiful day so sitting outside was nice. the spinach artichoke dip was good but VERY rich-a nice place to spend  weekend day. it was packed at 3pm so i'm assuming it would be worse at night. not bad for a local brewery

this is my real udpated review.  demetrios sent me my gift card right away and my boyfirend(also a fellow yelper) and i went with his roommate. the service was great- we had the same server as last time and she was really helpful. the greek dressing is amazing- very creamy and very authentic. i got the slouvaki- the only bad thing was that they were out of lamb but the beef and chicken were very good. the mediterranean pizza was amazing and the feta burger was ordered again, this time medium well, and was well cooked. i will be returning and appreciate the chance to give it another try!

i have so many friends that love lush but had never tried them. went to the store and was greeted immediately and not at all pressured. i got exactly what i needed+ a sample of their hydratingg shampoo bar since i had mentioned that my hair was dry. i abolutely love their stuff- i've been using it for almost a week and can already see the difference!!

i seriously love middle eastern bakery. i usually get take out but every time i've eaten in the service has been great- the owners take time to answer question about the food and you can tell they care about their customers. i usually get the vegetarian platter- their falafel is the best i've had since i moved to the southwest, the dolmades are good, and their tabouli is good and not too lemony.. i've also had the lebanese chicken, which is awesome, and the gyro, which was good but not amazing. definitely order the lemonade- it's rose water and excellent!!

the four stars are strictly for the cupcakes and the service. $2.75 for a small iced tea is outrageous and while the field veggie sandwich was good- it wasn't worth the almost $8.00 i paid for it. the cupcakes, however, were amazing-the boston cream and red velvet were SO good and the fact that they held them in the freezer for me until i got there was great. i would recommend you call ahead and find out what flavors they have-they are more than willing to make suggestions and give reviews. the place is nonsmoking inside and out, which is a plus for 99% of the population.

saw pinback there and will be returning in may to see man man. the floors were sticky, there's only one toliet in the bathroom, there was an odor that almost made a friend of mine physically ill and they have a fair beer selection with not so great prices. it's really a typical music venue- nothing great, though they do seem to get decent bands

i love asian food- i also love spicy food and decent portions and thai hut gives me all of that.  the service is excellent and the drunken noodles with tofu are amazing. i get it thai hot and it is plenty spicy! i've also had their green curry, which was excellent. there are a few places in tempe that i like better, but it's the best in central phoenix, imo

i hadn't had a haircut in over a year- my ends were ridiculously dead and i had to basically pull out my hair every day when brushing it. i went to ginger for a cut and brows- i've been growing my hair out for over two years and wanted to keep as much length as possible and also wanted something simple since i don't own a hair dryer and have no desire to try and style it. she ended up cutting a little over an inch off and it looks and feels AMAZING! she checked with me through out every part of the cut and just put little layers in it and cut it dry, which i really prefer. i never felt pressure to buy product but ended up doing so since what she used was so awesome. now onto my brows- i tend to overdo my brows and have tweezed and waxed them to death. ginger did an awesome job and explained exactly what she was using and showed me them before she did anything further. overall, i am a HUGE fan- well worth the money and will be returning for regular cuts and brows!

i have always loved  whole foods but this one tops them all as they have an amazing bar with at least 20 beers on tap- microbrews and imports. they have a beer class every friday at 7:00pm and james, the brewmaster, is super knowledgable and does an awesome job. they have mini restaurants in the store so you can eat while you drink. i look forward to my friday nights off so i can go, be educated, and have great beer!

i like cheeseburgers- i really do. i'm not all that picky when it comes to them but i can appreciate a good one and lucky boy has good cheeseburgers. i usually get the ranch burger with cheese and bacon- it's a good size, well made, and for $6 for a good sized burger and fries, it's definitely worth it. the fries are thick cut and don't taste at all frozen. i've never gotten a shake or a drink there- they're a bit pricey and i'd rather go to the circle k next door for a soda. i only have two complaints- the first is that they close too early! i wish they stayed open until after8. the second is that the parking/drive through situation is horrendous- trying to turn from 16th st and navigate through the parking lot into the narrow drive though is very difficult:( it's still worth it, however, for an awesome and inexpensive meal!

i hadn't had pho in forever and my dinner date had never had it, so we went on yelp reviews and came here and i'm totally glad we did! the ambience is great- zen like and calming. we ordered the spring rolls- very good. i had the #22- bun bo hue. it was amazingly spicy and flavorful- the meat was lean and the portions were plenty. i had read a yelp review where the reviewer claimed the portions here were too small-i'm used to big food and i was fully satisfied. my boyfriend got the pho tai chin- also good but a little milder. the service is a bit meh but still good. i will be returning and thanks to my fellow yelpers on recommending another great place!

i'm not a veggie but i tend towards veggie food and i do love indian food. i loved the chutney bar! the only variety i wasn't crazy about was the tamarind but that could have been just me. the portions are amazing for the price- when they brought a huge plate of air filled naan, we were amazed and impressed:) i have already recommended it a few times and will be returning!

we come here about once a week. the soup in a bread bowl is yummy- i usually get a wildflower salad with the pesto vinegarette, which is amazing! their grain mustard is also amazing and the service is usually very good. the clientele can be interesting so it is a good place to people watch :)

went once and that was enough for me. the waitress was snotty and not at knowledgeable-when asked if the seasonal brew was hoppy, she said no and looked at me like i was crazy. the beer was extremely hoppy, of course. she ignored us once she found out we weren't ordering food and the beer was mediocre and overpriced.

the only saving grace about this place is that after 10, they have their rocky pointe nachos for $4. those are super yummy BUT the place is a meat market and they have little to no wait staff. i'm sure i'll go again, but only if there's no other real options. you can smoke inside and that also is a plus..

i just had my 2nd move with justin time movers and they are amazing! there's so much i love about my experiences with them that i'm struggling to write a decent review! they are professional, efficient, and super reasonable.  this time- i called a few weeks in advance but couldn't actually book until two days before my move. they called me when they were on their way, came right on time, respected my belongings, and kept my move under three hours. the movers were personable, respectful, professional and just all around awesome. their prices are super competitive and the price they quote you is the price you pay and i really appreciate it.  i have recommended them to everyone i know doing and they will be the only movers i will use while in az!

i still love woodlands the best but a lunchtime craving for indian food paid off when we went to new india! i got the palak paneer combo- the portions were great as was the food. the spicy chutney they served was amazing. the gobi was even better- spicy and not overloaded with sauce. the prices were decent and the service was great- i'm assuming it was the owners that were working. i really want to go back and try the buffet too!

i'm a caffeine and coffee shop junkie but i hadn't really explored the awesomeness that central phoenix has to offer until recently. i really like fair trade- the prices are good, the service was good, and the coffee was amazing! at one point, their credit card machine went down and they still made my drink and didn't charge me until they could accept my card. the spot is nice and they do have a bit of outdoor seating for us nasty smokers-will be adding it to my caffeine fix list!

i saw a ton of 5 star reviews o this place, including one from a friend of mine, and it is basically next door to gold bar so i decided to try a bacon cheeseburger. the service was fair at best- the girl that took my order obviously wasn't listening to me and got attitude when i repeated what i wanted. i thought the burgers were cooked to order but obviously not. after she took my order, she came out from behind the counter and sat on her phone and the cook gave me my food. now to the burger: it was grey. yes, grey and greasy. the grilled onions were good but the "lobby's sauce" seems to be taco seasoning, ketchup, and mayo. i was so unimpressed that i doubt i'll use the check in offer i got to try something else

i like tmi but i doubt i'll ever be a true fan. we went there yesterday during monday's "all day happy hour"-the seasonal draft was exempt and they were out of two of the 5 remaining drafts. plus, our waitress was actually bitchy about the fact that we questioned the fact that they were out of so many beers and  waited to order food until our whole party arrived- there were a decent amount of tables available and after she took our order, she basically disappeared until it was time for a check and handed them to us with the most unattractive bitchface. i'm a fan of the music but it's a bit too loud at times. the food is good but so is a lot of other food in the area

i've been to pita shack twice and the first one was solely based on yelp reviews. i will be returning as much as possible- the staff is amazing, they talk to you, make recommendations, and generally make you feel like a valued customer. the food is also amazing- the lentil soup is super yummy, the veggie oombo authentic, and the chicken shwarma and gyros are delicious! definitely a place to check out if you're in the mood for actual greek/mediterranean food!

disclaimer: this review and the two stars are for the chandler location ONLY! i will post a review of the tempe location along with the extra star it deserves. i grew up around authentic kosher delis and was in love with chompie''s the first time i went to the tempe location. we went past the one in chandler and decided to give it a try. the restaurant was not busy yet it took quite a while for our sever, who seemed to hate her job, to even come get our drink orders. our drinks came and then it was another 15 minutes until we got our 1/2 sandwich and soup. our waitress then disappeared. the corned beef was lukewam and a little fattier than i'm used to. the matzo ball soup was good-no bagel chips, however. the service shocked me- i'm tempted to give this a one star review since our waitress, amy, was so rude and horrible. i will still be a chompie's fan but plan to avoid the chandler location at all costs!

i'm not sure why i haven't written a review for jobot yet- i'm there at least once a week and it has become my go to coffee shop. their toddy is the best i've had in phoenix- it's well made and a good price. the crepes are good as well- i usually get either a #2 or a #3 with an egg. i've really never had issue with the service- i'm not expecting my barista and i to be bffs. the fact that they are open late sun-thurs and 24 hours on fri and sat is a plus and so is the wifi. it's a cool spot and the crowd is way less pretentious than lux or cartel.  have only one complaint- the piano in the back room has been a source of annoyance for months now. i know it's not always being used but when it is, it makes me question whether to move onto songbird or lola...

i move here in november from georgia and was so excited when i saw that mellow mushroom was coming to tempe. went last night and was so not disappointed! they have the same amazing beer selection and food that i've grown to love. we got the "mellowterrainean" pizza- a greek chicken pizza with a side of tzaziki sauce. the service was good and i plan on going there again to grab a portabello and cheese hoagie

i got a door hanger from this place with coupons and decided to try it. ordered delivery and was told 45-60 minutes-this was on a wednesday night at around 6:30pm. 90 minutes later, i called and was told the driver had already left. 2 hours later, i called and canceled my order. the woman was nice, canceled it, but told me the driver had left a while ago and to just go ahead and take the pizza. almost 3 HOURS later, the driver knocked on my door- he told me he had gotten lost trying to find my place (you have to walk around to the back of the building to get to it) and told me i could have the pizza since "he didn't like mushrooms' . the pizza was obviously cold and slightly smashed. it was decent pizza but i doubt i'll ever order from there or even eat at the restaurant again!

i was  anxiously awaiting the opening of this restaurant- i'm not a vegan or a vegetarian, though i do tend to eat that way, but i enjoy good food and i really enjoy good diner food. we went there at around 1pm on a saturday- they are open from 7am-2pm and it was still relatively busy. we were seated right away- the decor is fun and kitschy. the service was very good- all of our questions were answered and our server made us feel very comfortable. i ordered the reuben- the marble rye was amazing! the slaw for the sandwich was both sweet and sour and i definitely couldn't tell the swiss cheese was vegan. my friend ordered the coo-coo (?') banana pancakes- he couldn't stop raving about them and was very pleased that the side of fruit salad he ordered actually contained different kinds of fruit. i'm only sad that i didn't order the eggplant bacon- my boyfriend is now obsessed with it! i can't wait to go back to try it  and a piece of their homemade pie!

I can't say enough good things about this office- after a hellish nightmare with eyeglass world, i got on the target optical website  booked an appointment online for that same day. got to the office-the front desk staff was amazingly friendly, they got me back right away,  dr ziff(?) very was friendly and thorough, and my exam was done in 15 minutes! i wasn't planning on buying glasses there and they gave me my prescription with no pressure or hassle- i would definitely recommend this office!

i am a full blown fan!! i've used lush products for many years and i've now completely switched to strawberry hedgehog- it's eco-friendly, vegan, and made with obvious care and love. the tea tree rosemary soap is awesome for my oily skin as are the toner and moisturizer. my husband and i are huge fans of the sandalwood/patchouli and ginger/citrus soap- we both started using the peaceful person natural deodorant and it works great! the products last for a good while and the prices are very affordable. my only problem is not buying everything when i shop!!

I honestly feel like this might be the best pizza in phoenix! we came here tonight and ordered an 18" pizza with garlic, mushrooms, onions, and olives- there were three of us, all major pizza eaters, and we still had 2 slices left. I felt the price was totally comparable to other places in phoenix- if I want a $5 cheese pizza as another reviewer mentioned, then i'll go to little caesar's. the fact that they used kalamata olives was particularly awesome. the pizza was amazing, the outdoor seating area is nice and has misters, and the service was great. the fact that they are open until 4am is also a plus!
