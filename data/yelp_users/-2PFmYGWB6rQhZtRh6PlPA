Clean, had some pretty good prices and a lot of the goods. And like the variety of not norm grocery items, plus the friendly staff was helpful.

The employees I encountered barely speak English. They were semi busy so it took a while to get my order in and the freakin thing didn't even come out any sort of correctly. I also realize that the carhops do not make regular minimum wage so i also tip. This is the first time that I absolutely refuse to. She didn't even bring a spoon for the sundae so my kid could start eating it while we had to wait for our food to come out at different times.

Like their happy hour stuff, pretty good sushi for being in Phoenix, good service, friendly people, funny sushi guys.  We had went there after being disappointed by Nobuo at the Teeter House, found out they were owned by the same company, became less of a fan after that comment.  Seems kinda dark sometimes.

Took a friend here to pick up some things he needed and I wanted to see what Rainbow Loom stuff they had.  After trying to get the attention of the 3rd employee and having to wait while they finished their conversation, I was informed that they only received about a dozen of the upgraded kits and has sold out of them a few week prior, and they weren't sure if/when they would be getting anymore in.  At the check out counter we had Ryan.  He was making jokes and really friendly with the person I brought and while replying I said one word that he didn't like.  I apologized and was trying to be friendly with him but from start to finish, he wasn't very nice to me at all.  Ryan kept rolling his eyes and was very short with me.  So I started to think that maybe he was rude because I don't look Caucasian.  Either way, he should not be working in anything customer service related.

We used to love coming here, but am leaving very angry today so, I'm not too sure that we will be visiting here again.  Every time we have ever been here, they have had clam chowder. It is one of those staple soups. Each month they do feature something new or different, but there are a few things that are always the same. We came today. Still actually sitting here. Got our salads, paid, sat, and checked out the soups. My hubby went up first and noticed that the chowder only had scraps left so he figured that they were heating up a batch to refill the container with. When I went up a few minutes later, the container was almost scraped empty and the sign labeling the item was still there. We ate our salads and some other soups, waited for half an hour, saw a few other people waiting for that soup too, noticed they replaced the container...only to have something totally different in it!  I asked what happened and was told that they only make it on Fridays!!! On the site it says that it is one of the soups today and have never been here when it wasn't. But, now it is only on Fridays?  And, if I wasn't already disappointed enough, it got replaced with something I couldn't even eat because of an allergy to cilantro.   The glorified busser in our section asked if everything was okay, told him no, he said he would have the manager come over. Been another 20 minutes and that guy hasn't come over yet.  There was one lady, not sure if she is assistant manager or supervisor was super friendly, apologetic and even tried to see if they had any in the back. She at least tried, the manager could learn a thing or two from her.

I love Kohls, whenever people get me gift cards I try to get them to Kohls.  I love the Kohls cash, especially when my mom goes shopping online, she just emails them to me, plus all the percentages off make you feel like you are getting a great deal.  HOWEVER, the thing I hate about Kohls is the fact that they raise some of their prices for a big sale to make people feel like they are getting a GREAT deal.   Luckily I keep up with the prices and shop around to see who offer the same things for cheaper.  This Kohls is usually kept pretty clean, and the employees are friendly, even the ones that tend to space out.

Went for family breakfast.  Our server was the service captain, I think her name started with a K, it was 2 weeks ago.  Everything for the most part was just okay, nothing great.  She was kinda of slow with everything and thought she could remember everything, but couldn't even remember to bring lemons for water.  She wasn't the nicest either, kinda of that fake nice thing that a lot of servers tend to do, but would have been portrayed better if she hadn't been rolling her eyes. Not crispy bacon means the bacon will bend!  I always ask for bacon that is not crispy. There was a hair in my brother-in-law's pancake.  They didn't seem mortified or like it was something that doesn't normally happen.  For that reason alone, I will never go back there.

Would have given 3 stars based on the food, but the server (Brianna) was what made this place get only 1 star. We (4 of us) went for Cinco de Mayo and they weren't busy when we got there, about 430.  Brianna took our order, another guy brought our drinks, she didn't bother to tell him I wanted lemons for my water.  She didn't bother to ring in margaritas on the rocks instead of frozen, and when she finally came back to the table, she just kinda chuckled and said she didn't write it down and told them to take the wrong drinks to us anyway because we would be happy since they had alcohol in them....UMMM NO! it is not okay, we asked for more chips, she walked by them and kept walking.  A few minutes later we passed by them and got our own.    Asked for extra napkins...we had to get our own.  She didn't seem to do anything right. Asked to speak with a manager, Forrest, he seemed very timid and unsure of everything.  Not sure how he is even a mgr.  All in all she shouldn't be allowed to be a server, she also discriminates offering certain tables stuff while doing not even the bare minimum for others.

Went on a fri night...they are the busiest here but with the call ahead seating we got a table right away.  We love Roadhouse... consistent food and service and the two of us and sometimes my kid and usually leave full with leftovers for about $35! And...fried pickles= YUM!!!

Corey is our "server" and he is super fake. The main reason I know this is because when we were walking in he was clocking in and was adamant to let the girl (his female room partner) that he was now on.  She was the one that took our drink order, she also brought out our food and even took an order for us for fried pickles when she brought our app.  Corey was complaining in the kitchen when she let him know because our meals were already ordered, so I let him know that it didn't matter whenthe pickles came out.  He spends a lot of time trying to rack up the check but not taking care of the table. As a server, it doesn't matter how much my bill is, there is potential for a great tip.  Corey also does not know how to prebus or stop at the table when asking if the meal tastes good. I am pretty sure he is one of the servers that tjinks he will make more by having lots of tables instead of giving quality service.     If Jessica was our actual server then the rating would have been better.  She helped us more than our supposed server.    Food is Chili's, it's the same everywhere.  Not great, but not bad. Decent.

Employees seem a little snooty unless you are a regular.  Had a party of 7 and business was dying down so they just had to clean off tables and that took little over 10 minutes, but no biggie. The server took a while to come greet us, but came back with our drinks in a reasonable amount of time and tried to take our order but had to come back to get the rest. She refilled our drinks once and checked on us once.  We asked for butter and she said she would bring but almost 8 minutes later we had to ask a bussed for it. When she was clearing plates she asked if I was finished with mine and when I replied no, she tried to take my plate anyway.  You would think a server would offer the bill or anything else when everyone is just sitting around but no. We had to ask.   So we just got our bill and we weren't aware that gratutity is apparently included so that is why the service sucked. Never coming back again. Food was decent hut not worth the service!

We went because I was craving artichokes.  Looked up the facebook page and got the coupon.  Rachel was our server...she was really friendly and smiled, and was pretty good but  I felt like we were running her since she would always leave the table quickly.  It was slow when we got there, but then again it was just before 5.  Our meal was paced nicely and the prime rib was more over medium than the mid rare ordered, but overall it was a good dinner.

Small quaint place. Hardly anyone else there. Went for happy hour after reading yelp reviews...and so glad we did. It was great! Decent prices and awesome sushi. Nigiri has pretty big pieces also, eel sauce not overly sweet. Vegas roll best I've had in Phoenix. Salmon melts in your mouth. Miso soup good, beef carpaccio cooked very well and not drenched in sauce. Crazy roll is pretty awesome with right amount of spice. Yum! Can't wait to go back

I usually don't check in or give reviews for fast food joints, but I came here after my PT appts and couldn't believe that McD's employees were actually friendly and efficient.  The one time I did go inside (btw I only get a large sweet tea when I do go) I was in shock that the inside was that clean!  I wish they could swap the employees with the ones on 24st and baseline in Phx.

I really needed to get my nails taken off so I found this place on Yelp since it is so close to work. They happen to have an available appointment during my break so I came and had Claudia. She is so super nice and fast. Tammy is also here and seemed nice. Was out in like 10 minutes and will definitely try when I get another set done!

Had a craving for Schlotzsky's today so went.  Jentyl was the cashier and was super friendly and was able to offer suggestions which I ended up getting for the hubby, I always get get the original on sourdough.  They got new the new drink machine that makes an exorbitant amount of combinations. The cinnabon looked okay and I was going to get one but they didn't look $3.49 appetizing.   And the  one thing I absolutely hate about this place...the smell when you walk in.  It always smells like the sewer backed up when you first enter, have never been in the bathroom.

Got in quick, got out in a reasonable amount of time for what was being done.  Got a list of stuff that needs to be done to car...stuff I already figured needed.  They got a new manager who used to be just an employee, and lots of coupons online to help out.  Plus they weren't pushy and very friendly

I only went through the drive thru earlier today, but, everything I could see was clean and Melissa was manning the window, great smile, super friendly.  I was able to see two two of the other employees and they all seemed to work well together being friendly AND efficient, wasn't even going to check in until I had such a great experience.

They get the extra star because the store was clean.  Ashley and the girl cashier are awful. They seem very lazy and don't care about customers and should learn how to deal with people better.  Those two employees alone make me want to switch to Petco solely instead...

We went after going to Glendale Glitters and got here about 10pm.  We sat down right after walking in, they weren't too busy at that time.  We had to wait almost 10 minutes before a server came over, guess his shift was just starting because you could hear either the other server or manager telling our server to that maybe they want to clock in and start working since their shift was starting.  I got our menus, we had to wait to get silverware until after our food came because they said they didn't have any, some of our silverware was still a bit dirty.  Our server took a few minutes to bring our drinks and that was after he had to come back and ask again what one of them was.  He was slow, but nice enough.  The food was okay, it's typical Denny's food.  When we were about to leave,  I counted I believe 6 of the employees standing outside, near the front door, talking and smoking.  Even the MoD was out there with them!  Right outside the door, not even down the ramp, not the 20 feet all the signs says.  I'm pretty sure the only employee left in the building was the kid that was serving us.

We had taken the hubby's car to Manny's and had to come here for the rental car through the other person's insurance.  The driver that picked me up was friendly, but the other employees were just kinda there.  The process took forever, they weren't very organized, didn't know what was going on, didn't have their reservations right, couldn't get my card to run because of all this, and didn't have any choices.  I would never rent from Hertz unless I absolutely have to again.

The guys here are great! Especially Nick and Nathan, I only know their two names. My hubby had no air conditioning in his car and the price that I was getting from friends was about the same price I got from these guys!  I called in the morning, dropped off the car, and it was ready the same day.  The shop is kept clean and doesn't have that dirty garage smell, they have a couple vending machines, and a TV to keep occupied if waiting.   I feel like this place is more about getting and keeping customers happy rather than some of the other places that price gouge patrons once and don't get them to come back. I'm okay with driving the 20 miles to bring our vehicles here from our house.

I had gotten a living social deal back in July for this place and it was going to expire Monday so we went last night still celebrating the hubby's graduation.  Parking was a nightmare.  The hostesses were nice and smiled.  Rachel was our server, came by promptly, was able to give recommendations, and did a great job.  We started with the spinach artichoke dip,  it was unconventional but tasted great and had a kick.  We also had gotten the blackened chilean sea bass, really good and not dry, and the porterhouse, good flavor but was one of the fattiest steaks I have had in a restaurant.  There was also roman bread and the kid and hubby both really liked it, but I couldn't eat it since it is made with rosemary.

Saw the article about the "magical" burrito and decided to finally try this place.  It seems a tad pricey for what seems to be a taco shop, but the employees were friendly and I am guessing by the amount of time it took to receive my order that they are all made to order.  The main issue that I had was I had also gotten 2 chorizo, egg, potato  burritos and added cheese, can't really recall any potatoes, but there sure were A LOT of egg shells in my burrito.  The Fundido burrito was pretty good, better with their hot sauce, and the chicken chimi with red sauce was good.

Arrived the afternoon of 12/2.  This was the second time I stayed at Harrah's Las Vegas this year.  The valets were friendly, the box office lady was friendly, the maids were friendly, and I wish I wrote down her name, but the lady who checked me in in the diamond check in was awesome!  The "snack bar" was closed the entire trip and the cafe is closed during the day/evening.  Cocktailers didn't come around often at all and took a while to come back with the beverage.  And out of all the Caesar's properties I seemed to have lost here and Imperial the most.  The room was upgraded to a suite and was nice, well the couch was a but lumpy and older, but the beds were comfy, loved the jacuzzi tub and the shower.  Also loved the fact that I could see the water show at Bellagio from the room

My Bestie and I found this place on Yelp and fell in love with it. We actually wish we could pick up the place and move it to Ohio for her and to Phoenix for me. John is quick and amazing as is the others, everyone is also super friendly and we were able to have full on conversations with them! It isn't on the strip, but is totally worth the drive.  They also do a great job with eyebrows!

We stayed here because it was the only Caesar's property that I haven't stayed at. We arrived late because we left late since I had to work so the diamond check in was closed. We went to the desk and a little Asian lady and a tall black guy checked us in. They weren't very friendly and were not accommodating at all. I reserved our reservation through the VIP line and they said that they had requested that we be upgraded but the people at the desk said that they would have to ask the hosts and they might based on play. It has been my experience that the Caesars properties casino hosts are all useless...except I think her name was Veronica or Victoria at the Rio. They don't work with anyone that doesn't spend 10s of thousands of dollars. The employees at this hotel and casino act all hoity toity when the place isn't even that great. The rooms are mediocre at best. After the service we received I didn't even want to play at any of the properties and ended up spending more at the MLife properties. Will never stay here again

We went there for dinner after our wedding.  We had 15 people in our party and got served with no problems and our server was great!  My mother and I started with the mussels as an app and they were HUGE, and weren't gritty at all.  Prices aren't too bad, especially for the quality of food and service.  So glad we picked this place.  Next time I want to go earlier during the day so i can try the crepes.

The food is pretty decent here but the employees are what makes the place suck.  Mona was the cashier and was rude and arguementative. Marjorie was the seater and was nice and pleasant. Genet was our server. I only got her name because I read it off her nametag. She only said on thing to us and that was to ask which wine we wanted because Marjorie didn't mind if we had one. She coulda said it better and without attitude. The busser took our plates and we were never offered for our drinks to be refilled.  This is becoming a buffet that I may plan on skipping in future trips.

We went here because a coupon I got from the MyVegas game on facebook.

Started our buffet of buffets pass last night here and started out with one server but ended up with Ronald when we moved tables because a family with a loud kid sat next to us.  The buffet was as it always is, some things great,  some okay, and some just no. They have a lot of variety in choices and loved the biscotti with my coffee. Almost took some with me!  Ronald was great, very attentive and was always on the ball.   Players club get discounts I believe, could be wrong, and locals get half off.

Haven't really ever had any issues here but this visit was different.  We had the buffet of buffets pass and I am a diamond member so we always hit the buffets without having to wait in the long lines.  We were sat in the diamond area and didn't realize that they had put platinum on the receipt.  The server was literally at the table when we were sat.  So we sit, we already ordered our drinks at the entrance counter, went around the entire buffet, I even got a crepe.  Get back to the table and my bestie informs me that the waitress just got our drink order.  While waiting the 12 minutes for our drinks to come back, a hostess starts questioning us about who sat us there and why we were sitting at that table.  I informed her that another hostess sat us here because I was a diamond member, she huffed and puffed and didn't believe me until I showed her my card, that was already on the table, and then started murmuring something about the counter people needing to do their jobs better.  Our waitress has finally come back with our drinks and cups and started walking off with the coffee.  She said maybe she should stop smoking so much, so either she was taking a smoke break while she was supposed to be getting our drinks or she smokes too much pot and can't handle being a glorified busser.  The only saving grace on this trip to the buffet was the crepe guys, they were fantastic!

The in-laws took me as this morning as a belated birthday meal.  They usually go to Crackers but I found this place under one site's best breakfast, and it got pretty good reviews on Yelp so figured why not. We went at 930 and they were busy but not busy enough for a wait...it was like people were still sitting from earlier.  The hosts seemed like a fake nice and when the bro-in-law and his girlfriend showed up, they didn't bother to bring them menus.  Never even caught the server's name but she seemed nice enough.  Two of the glasses on the table were dirty and when I handed them to her, she didn't bring new ones. It also has bad acoustics or something since it is kinda loud in the place, I kept having to have people repeat themselves.  I specifically picked a place that made eggs benedict because it is my favorite breakfast meal.  The hollandaise sauce was really good but one egg was overcooked since the yolk wouldn't run and the other was slightly underdone because the whites were a little jiggly.  I do really like how the pancakes are huge, my daughter should have only gotten one, and how they leave carafes of water and my tea on the table so you don' t have to wait for a server to refill.  We will definitely try this place again.  This visit was more like a 3.5 instead of 4

The bestie and I decided to finally catch a show while in Vegas, since I get 2 free tickets every month for being a diamond member, and we originally pick Penn and Teller but they were on vacation during the first week of December.  I thought this show was going to be super cheesy but agreed since she picked it.  I was wrong.  This guy is hilarious!  Tickets aren't super expensive like some of the other shows, and even raises money for charity.  Way better than expected and would recommend others to see!

Bring headphones.  This was by far the loudest library I have ever been to and the only thing said was..."oh yeah it is usually louder the last hour we are open."  The employees didn't seem to care and at some points were just as loud as the kids running around screaming and their parents.

Went there twice, first time wasn't that bad, but the second time, went off on the owner.   Pedicures aren't that great, they are just kinda eh.  And they, like most of the places in Phoenix, nickel and dime you...oh, you want...$5.   The only good things about this place is the guy that works there, he is pretty good, and the powder or one of the powders they  use doesn't lift as much as other places.  But the girls that work there aren't very good.  I had lots of bubbles and some of my nails already looked like I was needing a fill.  And the owner was extremely rude. When I told her about my complaints she blew me off and wouldn't fix it and I still had to pay.   I also told her about my favorite place for pedi s, which is in Surprise, and what they did for what cost, she told me I was lying and that no one did spa pedicures with salt and hot towels and massaging for $20.  So I told her that neither me nor my friend would ever be back!

More like a 4.5   I was going to give it 5 stars but then went in the bathroom.  The stalls are really small and if I were a little bigger then I wouldn't fit.  And it had been some time since they were checked because there was paper trash throughout the floor.  We went for date night before going to the movies because it is one of the places that offers a deal for restaurant week.  Instead of bread, they give edamame seasoned with sea salt, brown sugar, and togarashi (?) oh my are they addicting! The lobster potstickers were good even though there were only 3 of them, the sizzling beef app was tasty, but not worth $14.  The macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi, YUM!  I would even pay the asking price for that!.  Even the blueberry  cheesecake was light and fluffy.  Eric was our server and he was great!  Everything in a timely manner, the right personality, absolutely loved the team work they had there.  I think every should enjoy Roy's at least once!

They only get 2 stars because the price.  I know the Waffle House isn't known for their service but, today's was horrible. The cooks had yelled for our order to be picked up 4 times and she kept walking by it and even took another order after ours was finished...before bringing ours. Jodi was our "server".  Late night is way better

My fiancee and I went here for date night a little over a week ago because they are part of Upromise and I am glad we did.  We got the garlic bread with cheese...YUM!...and the special roasted tomatoes with shrimp app they had, good too.     He also had one of the specials on the board for dinner and I had chicken piccata (one of my favorite all time dishes).  His was good and mine was okay, could've been better, maybe if it was served with rice or something.  And we got their tiramisu for dessert...plus a coffee, a tea, and a glass of wine for $57.  Thought that was a great deal since we also had enough to take some home too.   The only thing was the server we had didn't start off very good, we waited almost 10 mins for an iced tea and water, and it took a while for him to take our order and for our apps to get out.  But, we will definitely be going back

Went with the hubby's family for his bday for breakfast.  Found this place on yelp!   Service is true diner friendly, portions are huge, prices seem good.  My daughter and hubby split the greek omelet and I had a bite, then wished I had gotten that instead of my eggs benedict.  Mine were okay, there was nothing wrong with them, just weren't the best I have ever had.  They could also use a better credit terminal/computer system.

We went here because I was craving the stuffed bread with bacon, cheese, and jalapenos.  It has been a few weeks now, but they were super busy, super friendly, seemed short staffed and still got our food within a reasonable amount of time.  Would have been all stars but my bread was a little overdone.

Don't come for the service at breakfast time.  Me and the Hubby went a few weeks ago and I wished that the review would show up on the check in date instead of the write up date but... We went for breakfast, were promptly seated, then waited, and waited, and then our waitress (I usually call them servers seeing how I was one for many years, but not in this case) finally gets to us and takes our drink order and sighs because I wasn't quite ready to order. When we did order, my hubby was asking me what he should get out of 2 things and all she heard was him saying something, heard it was a menu choice and decided he was getting that for breakfast.  Meals came out timely, they weren't the greatest things ever, but it was IHOP, and didn't expect them to be; however, they were pretty good, he had gotten some moons over my hammy type thing they have at Denny's and I got the double BLT and was happy that they didn't make my bacon crispy.  Finally got a drink refill and with it came the question if I needed a box...not if I was going to  need one, as I am still eating the last half of my sandwich and fries are gone, but the question wasn't brought up to the person that still had half a sandwich left and was no longer touching it. The bill came early almost the same time the food was dropped off and I guess that is protocol for them and by the service I guess she felt that since she dropped off the ticket that we no longer required service.  Talked to the guy in charge at the time and he made excuses and so I told him that we wouldn't be returning to any IHOP for a while and never again to this location

My bestie and me have been trying different places in south Phoenix to find which nail salon we like the best and went here based on someone's recommendation.   Um, not again!  The girls that work there are really nice and can hold a conversation in English but that's about it.   The paint from our pedis chipped, mine the next day.  And our nails started lifting not even a week later, I get hers lifting a bit since she works in healthcare, but I don't work and don't do anything where my nails would be lifting that quickly.  We both got our brows waxed and since we spent more than $50 it was free but would gladly rather pay for it if they are going to do it right.  Might not have been so bad if they didn't rush us to get to other people.

The employees here aren't the friendliest, especially at the customer service desk.  Eugencio? was a total dbag and even rolled his eyes at me when I told him that items weren't being rung up what they were being advertised for.

Went yesterday after the hubby graduation.  We had to convince his parents that this location is okay because they had horrible experiences at the tempe location.  Martin was our server and was friendly and attentive, didn't come by too often or not enough.  All of our food came out right and my sauteed mushroom burger was so good that it was stolen by my daughter.    Would have given 5 stars but the restroom wasn't totally clean, and an employee had even gone in there to fix her hair but didn't bother to clean it at all.  The fries weren't fresh, and the water has a weird taste to it, like either it isn't filtered or the line needs to be cleaned.

I wouldn't know about the food or waitstaff, but was trying to make a reservation for my wedding dinner and told them I would prefer they not put the gratuity because of all the reviews stating lack of service when auto grated and the manager was a complete asshole.  I explained to him why my request and he got very defensive and telling me they have policies and refuses to break them for any guest and it is there to protect his servers which NEVER give bad service or anything remotely close to bad service, and that we probably shouldn't eat there.  REALLY? what the hell kind of manager alienates guests who is bringing in a large party.  If you are that sure of your staff, then omitting the grat for someone who is a server, used to bartend and manage, shouldn't be that big of an issue.

Food was pretty okay.  Good rice and beans. Service was lacking.  Took her almost 10 minutes to get to us the first time and she wasn't very pleasant.  If you can't handle a 6 table section (1 of the tables had 1 person 4 of them had 2 people and pretty sure one had already paid, plus our 3 people and then a table of 4), you shouldn't get one.  Thought some of the prices were a tad high for MExican food but it is at a resort.  Not sure if would go back just because of the service.

I haven't had a bad experience with anyone from Dolce.  I think my massage therapist was Kristen? She was new to the location and came from the Arrowhead location. Would've given 5 stars if they didn't have everything as an upgrade and didn't have to push to sell anything extra. of course will go back since they have really good deals that can be found

My kid wanted to go here for her birthday so that is where we went.  Jason was our server and was by far the best one we have had in a while. He was proactive and very attentive with a great personality. The food came out properly cooked and had flavor which is what one expects from a chain but doesn't always get. Definitely a great experience here.

I don't know how the day time is, but late night they only serve a few items. The cooks are dirty and don't wash their hand or change their gloves after starting or wiping their heads or running their hands through their hair

Guess I am doing mass reviews today...I brought my car here one Thursday early in December and got a appt online the same day. I believe my service advisor was Nate and he was awesome. He had a feeling that there was a recall on my car, went and checked, and was right. I wasn't sure if I was going to have time for everything because I had to go to work shortly after. He had everything done with the recall and oil change by the time I got back from lunch!  Might have to make this place my choice for dealerships.

Went here just before 6pm on December 9th.  I only know that because it was where my daughter wanted to go for her birthday dinner.  We were sat within like 10 minutes and the host were friendly.  Our "server" was Melissa, and I only found out because I looked at her nametag.  She didn't do a proper greet, she took a while to deliver drinks, the only part of the welcome that she did right was offering a wine sample.  She didn't offer refills on soups, or drinks, had to wait to get the plates clears until we stacked them.  I saw her take a dirty plate from another table and put it on the tray while boxing a different table's food, and she lied about how something was made because the bowl was messy and she didn't want to take it back and get another that looked presentable.  They were also told that we were there for my kid's birthday and no acknowledgement or anything.  The assistant manager?  might have even been a service pro was the reason for 2 stars instead of 1.  She was nice and engaging when I told her what happened and seemed a bit mortified by some of the stuff I told her.  The manager seemed like a donkey (some words can't be said on yelp)  He was very dismissive and acted like I didn't know what I was talking about, and then I informed him that I was a server trainer at a different location.  Meal was comped, which I told them I would pay for it so I could get the survey.  Guess I will have to stick with either going to the locations I know or making the food at home myself.

My daughter wanted to try here for her birthday. We went 12/10/14 for her 10th bday.  The staff was super friendly, and the restaurant was clean.  The chicken bryan is really good and flavorful, pastas were well cooked, and tiramisu tasted like it had been doused in Kahula.  I tried the arancinis too because I was told that everyone loves them...they were just ok.    People should be aware that they do nothing for birthdays, not even a candle.    Also, can be a little pricey.

I love this place, for the most part.  Except I don't get why rice is so expensive!  I tend to find the majority of stuff I need and a lot more stuff I don't here.  The only real complaint I have about this place is some of the prices.  The Asian candy costs just as much here and sometimes more than in "American" stores  I could probably drive to San Diego get the same things at my old store and drive back for less than it costs  here.  I also don't like how some (more than a few) of the produce is going to go bad within a day if not use and some already looks like it went bad.  But at this place, a lot of random out there items can be found, and their meat dept doesn't seem bad at all and actually reasonable

Food wasn't bad. Just ok, cheese wasn't completely melted on omelet. Amber server woulda been better pretty sure if she wasnt the only one on or if the mgr on duty was better. He tried to give me a burnt english muffin after waiting 15 mins for it. Glad this place isn't one that I crave.

My husband's parents picked this place so we met here for family dinner.  It was a Sunday night and there wasn't a wait but when we went in there was a kid about 10ish working the register and then cleaning tables and picking up plates.  I didn't think that was right and seemed odd.  The buffet was kinda small and a lot of the pans were bare.  It seemed like most of the food out wasn't even Chinese at all and of what was out, it was just kinda meh.  If going off the food then I would only expect to it to cost somewhere in the $3-$5 range.  Not to say the prices were bad, but they are comparable to most of the other buffets with either more of a selection or better food. At least the restaurant was filthy looking but there was lots of food/trash on the floor. If I had to go back, I would only end up getting the ice cream which is scooped out of ice cream containers and doesn't come out of a machine.

Would get 5 stars but I don't get why everything has to be that expensive, and it is really loud in the restaurant.  There is nothing to absorb all the sounds. We have been there a few times now and none of the visits have been the same, not even the food was consistant.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good and a lot even really good, but it isn't the best food I have ever had even though it does cost the most.  The sides are big enough to share but I am not a fan of sharing my food. All the servers have been pretty good with the exception of Kim, I believed she didn't work as well since we had a party of 6 that time so she added a gratutity on.  Be prepared to be there for a while seeing as everything takes a while to get out.  I will go back again seeing how I get food comps from the casino, and even then can barely afford to go.

The hubby and I went back on Halloween since we had a bad experience for my bday and they were trying to redeem themselves. The host and hostess that were on were super friendly and smiled liked hosts should.  The restaurant was clean, as it should be.  Jeannie, Jeff, and Tyler (the one that has been there longer) were the people taking care of us.  Jeannie was really nice, seemed timid and unsure, I even had to tell her how to do one of the comps at the end.  We started with french onion soup (always a great choice), and blackened scallops with mango salsa ( tasted great, but was $14 for 2, salsa was okay, not a fan of mangoes).  Jeff took our order because they had gotten other tables, (just because there are 3 people helping each team does not mean they can handle 6 tables and still be effective). He got the chicken, meh; he liked it, but then again he will eat just about everything.  I got the quarterly special because it comes with the pecan tart.  I asked for my steak to be mid rare and it came out medium, I let them know and said I didn't want it remade because I didn't want to wait that long for my meal to come back, the steak had really dry overcooked onions and mushrooms topping it, (told Bob but he made it seem like I was crazy since they are cooked to order, STILL HAPPENS!)  I did get the lobster add on, Jeff tried to push me into the bigger one which was $15 more but I had already stated which one I wanted, don't be pushy. It was good.  For the sides we got steamed asparagus, scallop potatoes, and truffle fries, (the truffle fries tasted like regular fries with parsley, tasted no truffle oil, and saw a couple specks of parm but couldn't taste it).  For dessert we had the chocolate bourbon pecan tart with vanilla bean ice cream.  We had the same thing on my bday and it was AMAZING!, however, this time it wasn't the same, I was informed that it came from the same company but that doesn't mean squat to me, the only way you are going to know that it didn't change at all is if it was made in house...speaking of, why is a restaurant of this "quality" not making their own desserts?  If I had know that the tart was going to taste like that then I would have gotten something else all together.  Tyler was great! always filled our glasses, actually both of them ended up helping us and they did better than the servers.  Jeff asked if we wanted the rest of our stuff boxed up, and then decided that he needed to help other tables instead and pushed it off on the new Tyler, and while he ran to get the to go ramekins I stole the boxes and did it myself since I was ready to go and could do it quickly.  Took 20 minutes to get our bill and have Jeannie take the comps off and give it back, I didn't have to wait for change (luckily) because I made sure to have enough cash.  Bob was out doing his table touches and every time he came to our table he gave an awkward feeling, it was not natural at all, seemed very uncomfortable which I thought was weird since talking to him on the phone was great and he was funny, but not in person.    I think it is going to be a while before we go back, every time it seems to be something and for a restaurant that charges that much, it should never be anything that is less than outstanding

I went to this location because I had to get some stuff from Walmart since it was the only place open before 6am.  And since it was early in the morning...or rather late night for me since I hadn't been to bed yet, I was super hungry and Subway sounded delish!  Went across the parking lot and as soon as I stepped in the door was greeted by Tanner.  Very friendly and helpful.  I gave the basics of what I wanted and made him choose the other stuff for the sandwich.  My breakfast sandwich was great, I love that chipotle sauce!  The place was super clean and the other person working was friendly too, but Tanner!...keep him

I come here all the time even though I don't check in every time. The quality of this location has gone down and so has the customer service of the employees. Sabrina was the one in the window on this trip and she was almost rude. Like I was a burden asking for the sauce that they had asked if we wanted while ordering.

Beware if server spills a beer in the room  Went a while ago.  Their small plates are SMALL.  Service should be better considering.  The table that got sat after us was older, and they got better explanations of everything when they got sat.  We had to ask.  The clams were really good, the black cod was just okay, only had like 4 tiny pieces, but the sauce was yummy.  Their kimchi tasted like a white person version...not supposed to be offensive.  4 tables in the room we were in.  Acoustics were awful, sound bounced everywhere and was kinda loud and echoey.  Plus I like oldies music but didn't go with the place.  Also didn't care for our server.  She seemed like she was trying really hard at being one of those trendy hipster type people but just came across like a snob with a working man's complex

So we have been wanting to try this place since before it opened and finally tried it tonight.  Never again!  It is decently priced for buffets but doesn't come with a drink...and then you get the food and start to think that it is now overpriced.  The green beans were hard, the spring rolls were bland, as were the pork eggrolls and most of the food.  My daughter LOVES rice and noodles and after one bite wouldn't touch the white rice or lo mein noodles again.  The "salmon" nigiri was like plastic and the rice in the sushi wasn't good either...later found out that it is the same rice for the buffet and sushi.  Broccoli in the veggie delight and the beef n broccoli was pretty good but the beef was really fatty and chewy and the mongolian beef lacked.  They have both hot and cold mussels, the cold ones drip a lot of water and come frozen and just get put out and the hot ones come frozen and get heated a bit, both are chewy.  Popcorn shrimp has very dry breading, chicken nuggets and fries couldn't have been to good since again my daughter only had one bite of those.  Out of the soups the only decent one was the egg drop soup.  Even the mushrooms were kinda meh,  it's like they took a random brown sauce and threw some button mushrooms  in it without doing anything else.  It's like everything comes in frozen but they don't even get their food from a good supplier.  The baked sweet potatoes were really but they don't have brown sugar to put on them.  And Tim was our server person/glorified busser, and he did a great job and was friendly...plus, we spoke with a manager and he was really nice but didn't seem like he has a firm grasp on everything and more make excuses like sundays being crazy days for them and that was why the floor was so dirty and covered with food and trash, and he did say that they are building more and already have some in other cities and states and that they all use the same recipes, so BEWARE.  Lastly my guy will eat just about anything and even some of the most disgusting things and doesn't have issues with it and before we left he was already running to the bathroom

This place has become one of our buffet stops.  I absolutely love the smoked salmon! Service is actually pretty good.  We like to go for brunch.  The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that they keep burning or over cooking the Kalbi.  It is my most favorite thing ever, food wise, and had been over cooked every time we have been.

Went here because of restaurant week and just had to try the "famous" chop salad.  I am wondering if that was the regular size or a smaller portion as part of the meal.  The scallops were huge so getting 3 is no biggie, I am actually about to eat the rest of it.  My hubby got the lamb burger, he loves lamb, and it was really good but a little greasy/oily on the bottom.  He liked the fries with the cardamom ketchup but I didn't care for them, but I did really enjoy the "pickles".  The restaurant is open but with that come loudness, the acoustics aren't very good.  Really liked how the bathroom looked and how the stalls didn't make you feel like you were trapped in a tiny box.  The host guys were super friendly, both on the phone and in person, I called today to make a reservation but ended showing up an hour early.  Bussers quickly came by with water and Kent introduced himself as our server.  Dinner started a bit disappointing and my side plate was dirty but then became much better after the first round of food came.  Will definitely go back again.

Saw Christopher Titus here, found out it was a charity event.  The comics were funny.  Meaghan was our server...AMAZING!!! She rocked.  It sucked that one of the tallest people was sitting in front of me ( I am barely over 5') and the chairs were close together and all the drinks seemed to be $11 or more.  The food and drinks were good but for 5 of us, 1 drink each and 1 app each, was $135 plus an added grat

Finally got a chance to try this place after it being open for months and being just down the street.  The people are actually from Texas! And have really good barbeque. Some of the meat seems a little high but totally worth it.  Just means I wont be able to eat here as often as probably would like.  The sauce is on the sweeter side, then has a kick...and the pecan pie is homemade and isn't a true southern recipe but is really good too. If you are in the mood for great barbeque, try this place. Better than Rush's!

I called last minute when I noticed my dog wasn't acting like himself.  They got us in, and all the employees we encountered were super friendly and awesome.  Even the doc seemed to care about the well being of the animals and of Charlie.  Also they were very reasonably priced, and the office visit was less than that of all the other vets I called but didn't have time for my dog.  We will definitely make this our vet for Charlie

I was hesitant on having to go to physical therapy after the car accident, but absolutely LOVE this place!  I got very lucky that the other two places couldn't get me in quickly and that the other places didn't pick up the phone.  Ashley (receptionist) answered the phone in a calm and friendly manner, and was able to get me in the next day.  I ended up with Danny and even though I thought he was trying to kill me at times, he is awesome and amazing.  With his treatment, I was all good in 5 weeks (not normal) and my neck and back have never felt better.  I highly recommend anyone to has to go through PT come here.  Their awesome staff will take great care of you!

Burnt ends just okay, barbeque sauce pretty good, quesadilla bland, pulled pork sandwich was just okay.  The meat was super fatty, even for barbeque.  The fries have too much powder on them and taste like barbeque lays potato chips.  Service was just okay saw employees lounging near counter where food comes out with the paper or ipad or kindle or whatever brand, "chef" made table visits twice, but was to the same table.  Took my husband there for his bday and mentioned it twice before he got there and once again after he got there and not even a happy birthday and guess they don't do anything for bdays. WHAT THE HELL KIND OF BBQ PLACE DOESNT HAVE FRESH BREWED TEA?  Shameful!  And no potato salad.  AND...both of us ended up sick for a cpl days after eating here. We won't be back and tell everyone we know not to go there. Disappointing because the hubby kept talking about it wanting to go there for a while since he listens to the DJ that owns.

LOVE IT!  We went after voting.  The only thing was wish they had kimbap and daeji bulgogi on menu.  We got the Taka special chicken, and Kalbi (my favorite thing in the entire world!), and a boba smoothie.  The food was great.  Pretty sure the older Korean couple owns and they were so cute and sweet.  You order at the counter.  Will def be back...Oh and prices are GREAT!

I took my kid here after the movie because she has been really good and they had a sign for 25% off with that day movie tickets.  The place is quaint and the girls there seem friendly.  I would've given all 5 stars if the $3 cupcakes were a tad bigger and if was a flavor that had appealed to me.  My daughter chose the chocolate one (of course) and I took a lick of the frosting.  I am not usually a fan of frosting but theirs was light and fluffy and wasn't too crazy sweet...it was really good.

4 stars based on the tastes of the cupcakes.  We went today because I got a coupon for a free cupcake from 104.7 for my bday.  I don't get why these places are charging $3.50 for 1 cupcake, they are good but not that good...and also don't get why they use so much frosting.  The cream cheese frosting that was on the princess one and the frosting that was on the birthday surprise were really good and not overly sweet but there was way too much. Cute little place but probably won't go back seeing as I can make the same thing for a lot less .

We went during spring break on Monday and found out that it was dollar games and dollar shoe rentals, (GREAT DEAL), This place was clean, Mason was awesome.  And for a bowling alley, it wasn't too loud.  The only downfall was the lane servers weren't the friendliest and took forever to come by.

The burgers were great,  I had the Euro and my bestie had the Earth burger. Both were flavorful and just big enough to fill us. We got the Just fries since she is vegan and can't eat cheese. They were okay, just as the name they were just fries, no seasoning and were a little hard, not crunchy but hard. It comes with a chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup, I didn't care for either but she loved them both.   The fries, price, and service were the reasons why it doesn't get 5 stars. Our server took a few minutes to come to the table and different people brought our drinks, food, and the regular ketchup I asked for. They were busy, but as always, if you can't handle a bigger station then maybe they should staff more servers. The 2 burgers, 1 just fries, and 1 ice tea came to almost $50.  At least I had a diamond tier card and didn't have to wait in line.

Let me just say I LOVE Chik-fil-A!  We went here to get a snack and got a 12 count for 3 of us and I am so glad we pulled into the parking lot to eat them. Apparently whomever made the package couldn't count and shorted us.

Love how Trader Joe's and Whole Foods are right next to each other, because I can find everything I want and even things that I didn't know that I wanted in the same parking lot.  I absolutely love how fresh many of the offering are, and how much organic stuff they have.

Decent prices, great donuts, super nice (guessing) owner.  We went late at night while he was closing up. He saw us walking away from the door and opened up to let me get my craving.  We have made this our donut shop. We used to go to Central donuts and were sad when they closed, but now that this place has opened, we don't even miss them.

We are still sitting in the restaurant but I felt the need the go ahead and post.   I brought the hubby here for his birthday because we like to try new places and were craving Korean food. SO GLAD I FOUND THIS PLACE!   The reviews had people complaining about the service or the time it takes for the food to come out.  Service was actually pretty decent for a Korean place. They were friendly and always working and kept busy. When I really needed something I was able to stop someone and they brought it right away.  The food did take a bit, but it wasn't even as long as most other Korean places I have been to. Everything is always made when it is ordered and quality food takes a while. I make this type of food at home and it is an all day event. Everything we ordered was really good and reminded me of my father's cooking when he was alive.   Our table was visited by an awesome sweet lady and we thought she was the owner, turns out she is his sister and was just helping out for the night.  We will definitely be making this place our go to for Korean food! And it saves me from having to spend all day in the kitchen. Don't be discouraged by timing, just make sure you have plenty of time to enjoy.

We were told to go here from the guys that work down the street. The place is one of those small hole in the wall places, but the food was decent. My hubby got the chorizo burrito and I the bacon. His burrito was really good, but my bacon was crispy and I hate crispy bacon...but I didn't tell them so I ate it anyway. I also wasn't too crazy about my eggs but I like well done scrambled, so not docking for that either. I think it just may be the owners working, cute nice older people...of course she was cooking :). Probably try something on their menu when in the area again.
