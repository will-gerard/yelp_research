I've been taking my car to a national chain store for repairs for years.  Luckily, my 2006 Matrix is running great and I've only needed in the past year brakes and a belt replaced (about 5 months ago).  I also had the brake fluid changed and it was almost $800, I was also told I needed a front end alignment but by that time I was feeling so ripped off I just had to get out.  I WAS SHOCKED.  This past week while walking to my car I was struck at how bad my front tires were worn.  I convinced myself that I needed a front end alignment and I was worried about the rear brakes.     I called Compu-Tech yesterday and I dropped my car off at 7:30 am today with Shane and Wes.   As I worked within walking distance of their shop I didn't bother waiting and told them I'll be back around 3 pm.   Wes called me and said I didn't need an alignment and the back brakes are fine but dirty.   He also told me that he could order tires for me and install them but he couldn't offer the type of warranty you get at a tire place and his prices would be higher and suggested I get the tires replaced from one of those shops.   I told Wes to go ahead and clean the rear brakes and I'll pick up the car after work.    I'm am thrilled to find a locally owned shop with great, GREAT customer service.  Even though I live in Ahwatukee my car will be serviced by Compu-Tech.  I was so totally impressed and they answered all my questions.

Update.....I recommended a friend here to repair her broken driver side window motor.  They had it for the day and it is within walking distance of work so she gave it a go.  We both walked over to pick up her car since she was my ride home that day and the window worked.  But.  BUT, it sound horrible.  Horrible grinding noises.  It just wasn't "smooth" sounding as you would expect.   We both did a "hmmmmm".   I later found out they were under new ownership or management.   So I decided to bring my car in for an oil change.   They did that and then recommended over $900 of additional repairs including engine mounts.    I took my car to another mechanic and all I needed was front brakes, air filter and a recommendation for wipers.   I won't be going back.

This is the best Hot & Sour soup in the valley.   The Prime is my comfort meal when I have a cold as I always feel great after eating there.

While driving home from work last week my car developed a loud noise that sounded like I was dragging something.    When I arrived at home I got out and looked under the car and sure enough, a piece of plastic was hanging from beneath the fender.   The next morning I drove to work and left my car with collision center of a Toyota dealer that conveniently was across the street from work.   They had my car all day and  when I walked over to get the estimate it was $856 and they would need my car for 3 days!  That same evening I had to pick up my dog from Dog Days of Tempe and I drove past Tracy's Auto Body and the next morning I called.  Boy, was I happy I did.   I drove there after work  and Chip, the owner, walked out to my car looked underneath at the area and we went back into his office as he worked up the estimate.   I loved the setup they have too.  I had a monitor in front of me so I can see the prices and parts as Chip entered them into the computer.   The price for this repair, get ready for this people,  $141.   I authorized Chip to order the parts needed and a couple of days later he called and said the parts were in.  I drove back and waited while they did the repairs and I was out of there in 45 minutes.   Tracy's is a family owned business and one of his daughters runs the front office and was very nice as was her sister that was working in another section of the building.   Customer service is top notch and I really felt comfortable there.  They also have a car detailing serviced in the building called JT's Auto Detailing which is owned by a son.   I plan on getting my car detailed in the coming months and know I'll get the same outstanding service from JT's.

I've been in the valley for 20 years and never knew this place existed at "The Farm" on 32nd Street just south of Southern.   Seating is all outside under large beautiful trees, lovely breeze this morning too, it was one of the most relaxing areas I've ever experienced and it was hard to believe that I was still in the city of Phoenix.   We were seated within 10 minutes and our server Carrie was great with answers to any questions we even brought us a menu from the restaurant adjacent Quiesscence and answered questions we had about that restaurant.   Now the food.  I had the chef special which was a braised beef and carmeralized onion omelette with potatoes.   My sister had the Eggs Benedict with the potatoes and of course, being family, we shared.  Everything was delicious and fresh.   After we ate we wandered around the farm and came across a small crowd and we were informed that the goat had two kids yesterday.   Just watching them brought a big grin to my face.   Next to the goat pen was the chicken pen.     It was just a lovely morning.

I've been taking my boys here for years, even before Megan took ownership.   She has done an outstanding job in keeping the vision of Dog Days.   I recently lost my Scottie to old age and was worried about Oliver and how he would be without his big brother.  On his first weekend stay  the staff send me videos of Oliver playing with other dogs and I felt secure that my boy was well taken care of.

As a single person I find Fresh & Easy the ideal market for me.   My first stop is always the discount bin to plan my nightly, or next few nights, dinner.   My favorite time to shop is Saturday and Sunday mornings since the discount bin have more meat in it and I can bring it home immediately vacuum pack and store for later use.    The Italian bread is to die for.  YUM.  Love the addition of the in house bakery.   I routinely buy the F&E frozen entrees ($1.99) to bring to work.  (think lean cuisine)   Great cheese selection as well at better prices then Fry's or Safeway.  The dog food I buy for my dogs (not a big selection but they carry what I feed them) is $2 cheaper then Fry's and Safeway and to top it off the dog treats are all natural and a great price.   Yes the store may be small but keep in mind just about all you need is in the store.  I think I venture to Fry's about every 6 weeks to replenish the Blueberry Pop Tarts I keep at work for a quick snack.  F&E has Pop Tarts and cheaper then Fry's but not my favorite Blueberry flavor.

I went there yesterday for the first time and had the Eggs Benedict.  OUTSTANDING.  Hash Browns were perfectly seasoned and very tasty.  The hollandaise sauce was to die for and I wish I had toast to sop up every last drop.   My sister thought every thing was a bit salty but she seasoned before tasting so my advice is to taste first then season as we get used to the chain restaurants to under season everything.   This is a place that I have to come back so I can try everything on the menu.

I've been to Zookz 3 or 4 times and haven't had a sandwich I didn't like. I plan on working my way through the menu and Carole and the rest of the staff are outstanding.  Zooks is close to work so it is easy to pick up a quick breakfast or lunch sandwich and get back in our 30 minute time frame.    I don't eat my green veggies like I should (or at all) but I can survive on the Kale Salad.  It is to die for.   I would recommend Zookz to anyone.  It is located on Central across from St. Francis RC Church.    Try the Nutella, peanut butter banana sandwich as a dessert.   My friend and I share it as it is too sweet and filling to eat after a full sandwich.  Prices are great too.
