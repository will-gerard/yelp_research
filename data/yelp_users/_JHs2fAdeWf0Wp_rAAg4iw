Mama Java's is very cute.  We used to have work meetings in the back room (well, they company I work for still does but I don't work there anymore).  My favorite thing about Mama Java's is that they have MATTE!!!!!:)

The food is pretty good, especially the cheeses:) The cold brew is also pretty good most of the time.  The place is pretty adorable. I really enjoy coming here, but the parking sucks big time.  There is "free" valet in the back, but of course you should tip.  I mean, does this place really need valet?? Also, I avoid this place on weekend afternoons.

My husband rented a suit for our wedding.  A couple days before the wedding he went to pick it up and they had the wrong suit.  My husband is 6'2 and they had been shipped a suit for a man who was only 5'10.  Furthermore, their idea of fixing it was giving him a different shirt suit then the one he picked out months ago.  The women was extremely rude to me when I told her that I thought that was unacceptable and replied starkly that "mistakes happen".  I told her that it was her responsibility as an employee to fix the mistake.  After 45 minutes (if you've ever had a wedding then you know there are a zillion other things you could be doing in 45 minutes three days before the wedding) of her being rude and rolling her eyes at me, she finally got her boss to help us.  He gave my husband a new shirt (one that was not a rental) and just asked that my husband return it after the wedding, which he did.  I mean, was that really that hard for them to figure out how to make THEIR mistake right???

Parking for echo canyon pretty much sucks. They have blocked off a lot of the places you used to be able to park so it's kind of a hike to get to the trail, but I just try to look at it like it's a good warm up and cool down:) It's a pretty good exercise trail.  The only reason I gave it a 4 was because it's super crowded which can be annoying.

Great place to see movies.  The place is a bit outdated, but whatever, it kind of adds to the experience.  I've never seen a movie here I didn't enjoy and I'm so sick of predictable Hollywood movies.  If you haven't been, you definitely should check it out!!

When I moved back to Arizona I specifically picked a place to live that was within 5 miles of F&E so I could get coupons in the mail.  I love fresh and easy.  The food is pretty good quality and is very inexpensive, which is great for a college student:) I also used to work 2nd shift and their prepare meals were a much yummier alternative for dinner than having a sandwich or gross frozen meal.  I will say though that I am a very picky person and typically enjoy eating the same meals every day for months (for example, I have had F&E greek yogurt, raspberries, and F&E granola almost every day for lunch for about 3 months).  If you prefer a wider variety of food items F&E may not be your place; however, there is a sign out front right now that states they are working on getting over 200 new items:)

Great coffee and staff is pretty nice.  I have sat in Giant for hours on a few occasions trying to get work done and have always felt welcomed.  Anyone who says the coffee is over priced probably doesn't know what good coffee is.  It's not the best I've ever had, but it's pretty good:)

My very very favorite hike in the valley!!!! I love flat iron!!! The scenery and theme of this trail change quite a bit making it super fun to climb up it.  You probably should be a little bit experienced to hike this trail in decent shape.  Also, make sure you bring enough water.  I bring 70-100 fl oz in my camelback and that's enough.

Place is super clean and great customer service!! I think the guys who serve it are the owners because they do a great job at representing the place.  The yogurt is good but the toppings are even better.  By this I mean the fruit is always fresh and I'm pretty sure the use name brand candies because it tastes better then generic stuff.

I forget the number but I got the turkey, avocado, and bacon sandwich and the kale side salad. The sandwich was really good and I loved the salad! I asked for my sandwich w/o tomatoes and it was delivered to me with tomatoes so my husband took it back for me to get it fixed. It wasn't a big deal, I'm a picky eater and used to my food not coming out to me the way I ordered it, plus the food didn't take long to cook.   While we waited a woman came out, I think the owner, and apologized and offered dessert to us dessert on the house. She made us this delicious peanut butter, banana and  Nutella sandwich, so good!!  Overall, the food was really good but the 5 stars is for the service. I used to work for a well-known foodie deli in Ann Arbor, Mi (Zingerman's), where not only was I taught to appreciate food but also the value and importance of great service. If we made a mistake, we went the extra mile to fix it. Even though I wasn't upset about the mistake, I REALLY appreciate that they went above and beyond to make up for it. This is part of the reason eating at local, small businesses rock!

Service is rough. Went there today around 1pm with a coworker and there were only 3 people in line but we were in there 30 min (and our order was to go!). I didn't get anything because they were out if chicken, from what I overheard they run out certain food items often. Anyways, no one greeted us. We stood in front of two people making tortillas for 5 min and they didn't even acknowledge us. I understand if this is your role but one could at least smile and greet us.   When my coworker was trying to pay, a staff member opened the cash register to exchange their tip money and made us wait while they counted their tips before cashing us out.  Afterwards the cashier wrapped up my coworker's  food that had just been sitting there for a few min, meanwhile other staff continued to stand around and act like they hated their lives. They also kept asking my coworker "is this your food?" When you basically only serve enchiladas its hard to tell the plates apart, you think they would pay attention to whose food is whose.

OMG, yes please. So good! I would eat here everyday if it would not cause me to gain weight. I always get praline bacon (AH-maxing), a ham and cheese croissant (croissants just as good as in Paris), and beignets (not quite the same as in NOLA, but I'll still eat them!). I like to think if I walk here from my house it helps offset the calories.

Every time I go back home to Michigan I make it a point to only get food that I can only get in Michigan. It's still weird not to have Coney Island on that list but I'm definitely not complaining! Plus, the owner is SUPER nice!! I hope he opens more around the valley since I'm in central Phx. Plus, ASU downtown (where the cool kids go) would totally eat it up! Rush hour traffic pretty much stops me from going M-F, so that really only leaves Sat:( I could probably eat chili cheese fries everyday. Let's be honest, as a teen I totally did;)  And to the few people on here complaining about the prices, seriously??? We go here with my other friends from Michigan and the 4 of us for $24. Pretty cheap for such deliciousness!

Funke yoga is a relatively new yoga studio to Old Town Scottsdale, but it is NOT "Scottsdale". The owner, Mara, is very friendly and welcoming and so are the teachers. Every time I've been to a class there the teacher has always taken the time to help me adjust my pose to get the most benefit. I'm not flexible AT ALL so it's always nice to have someone show me how I can still get the stretch in without being able to touch my toes. I really like restorative yoga, it's an hour practice of deep stretching. Perfect for me since I run and I know I never stretch as much as I should! Plus, I work in a nonprofit so I get 10% off!
