Don't ever try to do teppanyaki when they open....they must get to work late....nothing was prepped and ready for the first customers....we will stick to Benihana!

I tried not to select any stars....that is disappointing to have to give them even ONE!  I've been to this car wash many times and have had things happen before but chalked it up to my irresponsibility..... money missing, things (not trash) missing or thrown out....kids toys, CD's....my Adele 21 stolen still burns my bum....but yesterday took the cake!!! I left my vehicle for an interior detail and VIP wash at 2:20pm Feb 11th, 2015....details are important you know....I had just left at CarMax and decided to spruce up my vehicle and sell it on my own...their appraisal was good, but I knew I could get more because the salesman said it was in AWESOME condition...I normally detail myself but wanted to save myself the sore back (big mistake)....so back to the car wash....I decided to leave my vehicle because even though they were totally dead I figured at LEAST 2 hrs, right? I knew they closed at 6pm and I popped back in at 5:30pm to grab my van....I hurried out so I didn't delay their closing, it looked OK, plus I always expect to get in those cracks and crevices you know they don't. However, when I pulled into my garage and walked around my husband met me at the rear and says, "Looks good except for your busted tail light, Babe! What happened?! I was shocked! Of course, I knew it happened there because I had spent all the time at CarMax getting it appraised! I called and Manny said to bring it back. Got there in 15mins....he met my husband and I outside and said, " I don't know"...probably 6 times...I'm being nice...I said, "I want to speak to the manager or owner." Ignacio is his name....says he will meet us at 8:30am the next morning to take a look. Next morning we arrive back at the carwash...I had already looked for replacement lights and even found some as low at $65....after all, I'm not trying to get anything out of this, but it' only fair to have them buy the headlight! Heck, I'm a DIY kind of girl and I can even put it in! Well needless to say, I got very upset as Ignacio basically implied that I hit something...."It didn't happen here" were his EXACT words...something like they don't ever have that happen and I have no proof (of course their cameras are NOT operational... Of course!) Offered me some carwash credit (are you serious?! Not after this! The other stuff I let slide but COME ON!) We left, I was so upset...got home, called CarMax just to verify EVEN THOUGH I KNEW IT WASN'T CRACKED BEFORE, even after my husband ran back down there with our paperwork from CarMax and explained that CarMax would have noted it on our paperwork because it would have to be replaced..John at CarMax insisted it must have been fine because Samantha would have noted it in her inspection (they do this all the time). My husband returned home and again, Ignacio refused to accept responsibility for the tail light. Reluctantly, I ordered my tail light online and went back out to my van to put my floor mats back into their spots in the van....and would you believe it?! One is missing! Okay, "please tell me I'm being punked!" This is just RIDICULOUS! We head back to the carwash again! I go inside and get the mat....Anna the cashier brought it to the counter for me....thank goodness she was pleasant, I might have lost it....and what do you know...there's Ignacio making himself a coffee...see's me and turns around...then walks past avoiding eye contact! What a piece of work! I leave and if I EVER hear the name Francis & Son's Carwash, it will be too soon. It's really sad how some people operate their businesses these days.

We got there after waiting over 30 mins for food at a nearby restaurant and gave up waiting...walked over to Szechuan and were so pleased with the speedy service at weekday lunchtime...,food was delicious! We will go back regularly!
