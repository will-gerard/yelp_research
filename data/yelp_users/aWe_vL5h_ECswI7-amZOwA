Its been quite a while since I've been back to PF Changs, but our server, Brittany was great last night! Very friendly and easy to communicate with. My tofu lettuce wraps were wonderful! Not enough vegetarian options without making things complicated though.. Otherwise great dinner and will return.  :)

Amazing customer service from everyone!  It was really busy for lunch and pretty loud. There was a huge line which appeared to move quickly.

Picked up a TOGO order today around lunch time. Awesome as always! My order was ready when I got there and was still fresh upon receiving. Great service and atmosphere.:)

Yay Vegan!! Everything I have tried so far has been good. My only complaint on the food would be that the Bacon Burger could use some lettuce or something. It's just a bit plain and dense.. It needs a boost!  However, the Wac is awesome! and the fries are always good. They're thin, crispy, and best when hot!

Excellent customer service this morning! The french toast is to die for! It was cooked to perfection with what tasted like REAL maple syrup! Definitely ask for the fruit topping on the side though. It's overwhelmingly sweet and would probably make the french toast a bit soggy.  We also ordered a lox bagel which was delicious! The bagel was toasted just right along with a lovely array of toppings including a whipped cream cheese, salmon, capers, and sliced tomatoes. YUM!  So I had to update this since I just opened my left overs.. I usually prefer to box things up myself at restaurants for this reason: The rest of my french toast was thrown in with the fruit sauce and is now ruined. :( The worst part is that there is no side of maple syrup! I had plenty left when they took my plate.. How am I supposed to eat this???

Be nice if I had some pizza about now. Ordered an hour and a half ago and it never showed. What a flake  pizza joint. -called 3 times and some one was there to hang up the phone every time so I couldn't even leave a message.

Love this place! I've been coming here since I was in middle school! Always been my favorite coffee spot. :)

Sky High does not deserve any more of my time, but I wouldn't want my experience to happen to anyone else.   In addition to total lack of customer service while at Sky High, I was overcharged on my purchase. I called later that night, the guy said he couldn't do anything, since he wasn't there when it happened. He said the owner would have to meet me another day and watch the surveillance tapes to prove that I was overcharged and that I should call back.. I told him that this was unacceptable and finally he agreed to have the owner call me the next day. I spoke with the owner, Mo, and he said I had to either come back to the store or he could mail me a refund. However, he said I would have to call back another time since he was too "busy" to write down my address.  I was really fed up at this point and started posting this review. Within minutes of this review being posted I received a number of phone calls (like 5 in a row) and a couple of voice-mails using profanity and then agreeing to take my information to mail my refund right away. Way to take responsibility...

Bomb bean burrito! Salsa is really good too! Perfect amount of spicy. Absolutely no animal products in both pinto and black beans! Amazing!

Only 1 vegetarian option on the whole menu unless you wanna build it yourself.. Not vegan friendly either.

Crowded and noisy...lucky if you find somewhere to sit.  Speedy service today! Vegetarian white bean chilli soup was just okay and the wildflower salad is always great.

Not as noisy or crowded today! Both hot coffee choices were decent. Wildflower grilled cheese was great, but make sure you ask for it on sour dough bread!

A little pricey, but so far so good! Took a couple of days, which is long enough for me to almost forget. Regardless, I felt my things were in good hands here. :) Informative and friendly staff. Will be back again soon!

I've been here a few times and today was probably the worst experience I've ever had at this location. The tables were gross and the girl working today was totally PMS-ing. She was slamming things around acting like a 2 yr old! The only words she spit out was the total and what spoon we wanted. I thought she was going to split my credit card in half by how hard she swiped it. LOL! Rediculous.

Outstanding management to work with! Came back today and enjoyed some brand new flavors that were just recently added! Everything was super clean and all of the staff was super friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back again soon! :)

Got a 5 cheese panini and a brownie. Panini was okay. It came with chips which were really plain, but the brownie was AMAZING! Probably one of the best brownies I've ever had!

By far the worst Americano I've ever had. There's hardly what any would call espresso in here! The girl that took my order had an attitude and when I ordered a bagel with cream cheese, she tried to give me one that someone just returned. This was only obvious since she handed me a bag as my receipt was being printed and the bag was already crumpled up with someone else's name written on it. wtf?! I told them my name wasn't Ashley and asked for a fresh order. when the girl that took my order found out she couldn't fool me she said, "well I guess this is nobody's then!!!" and stomped her feet all over the ground. LOL how rediculous.

Horrible Management! GM will not take responsibility for his own mistakes is very rude when spoken to. He will completely ignore and interrupt you, if you try to speak to him. VERY Unprofessional!!! I was so offended by the GM's attitude that I will never go back or recommend this location until he has been fired or just gone!

AMAZING place!! Staff is super friendly and the butterfly garden is a breath taking experience! It is pretty humid in there though, so don't bring a jacket unless you want to carry it around. There is also a variety of butterfly workshops! I personally enjoy the Butterfly Yoga.

Honestly, I'm not usually the biggest fan of the food at Jimmy John's, but I just ordered online and I was just blown away by how speedy the service was! My order was processed via email in seconds and ready to pick up in less than 10 minutes! Very convenient. Good job.

Horrible service.. if you can get any!! Also don't expect a tip if I've been waiting 20 minutes at the bar to order and then have you be a total jerk to me! I only tip when you do your job well (if at all)! This is America where tipping is optional to begin with.

So far I like it! A few vegetarian options here! Very happy with the caprese sandwich! It feels a little tight inside with not a ton of places to sit or wait for Togo orders. However,  food was ready quick and super fresh! Will be back soon. :)
