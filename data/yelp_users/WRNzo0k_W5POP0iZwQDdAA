This is our new favorite place!!! We went for a breakfast date and it was just amazing. The girls working there are so sweet and help so much. Every time we go the service is amazing. I was waiting for my husband there one morning and was sitting and the lady came over and was so sweet to ask me if she could get me anything while I waiting. Their breakfast is fantastic, I especially love the sour team muffins. No more paradise bakery for us!!!!

This is such an amazing restaurant!! The service is so wonderful. Everyone is so sweet and work very hard. Never had to wait for a refill on sodas or drinks! The food comes very quickly. The food is the most authentic Mexico City food we have had in az. The enchiladas and chile relleno are to die for!!!! Salsas are fantastic and I can't wait to try their margaritas, they just look so tasty.

THIS IS THE BEST RESTAURANT EVER!!!! Me and my husband go here a few times a few and we wish we could everyday! Everything tastes so unique not like everything is just cooked in a pan together. All the meat and toppings have their own unique tastes and seasonings. The price is wonderful, it allows us to get a few different things. I always get the pork quesadilla, steak taco and split the carne asada burrito. The salsa is wonderful, I crave their chips and salsa all week.   Their margaritas are a whole other story. My favorite margarita I have ever had. It is made with amazing tequila and fresh line juice. No mixes like other places try to sell me. They are strong, but since they actually use the good tequila it is just wonderful!!!!

We were not happy with this place at all. We went a little later in the evening and the lady working seemed very annoyed that we came in. I love leaving work on time like anyone else, but if business comes in I suck it up and smile! She was cleaning all around us and it was ver uncomfortable. Once we got our food it was so bland. I got the chile relleno and rice. The rice was a plain scoop of white rice with no flavor and the chile relleno was just plain and mushy. My husband got the chicken burrito and it was literally just baked chicken and rice with no flavor at all. The empanadas were okay but I felt weird that they just came microwaved in a plastic bag. Haven't gone again
