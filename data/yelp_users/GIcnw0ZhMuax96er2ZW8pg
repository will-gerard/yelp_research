Food was regular bar food, the beer was ok.  Omg but the wait staff, yeah that's what we did, WAIT.  Had to call them over to take our order, bring drinks and our bill.  All of this with only 6 people in the restaurant and 4 wait staff.  Will give them one more chance.

Thank you Nick.  I may have to drive to Tempe from Glendale.  Had an issue at the the midas at 43rd and Glendale and Nick took care of the issue for me.  Maybe he should instruct other managers what and how to deal with customer service.

As always the food was again great.  Had the menudo. It was excellent almost as good as my mom's (you know mom's is the best. At least 95% of the time)  The waitress was so busy but was able to take care of her tables and keep us satisfied.   Will continue returning back.  Love it here.

Enough food to have for lunch the next day and it was still finger locking good. Ribs were well rubbed and right amount of sauce.  The mac and cheese was a meal within itself.  Keep up the good work.

If I could give zero stars I would. I have been waiting for three hours for an appointment that was 2.5 hours ago.  The person is running behind, no kidding.  They must think people don't have any lives.  I guess schedules don't mean anything.

Wow, we had some pizza, chicken, potato wedges and I am filled.  It was so good.  The pizza crust was sweet, potatoes were MOJO type.  Reminded me of shakeys.  The chicken was great and not greasy.  Loving it.

I made an appointment two weeks in advance as I had two cars for them to do the chip repair. Was told between 8 and noon.  1151 am, I called and they said it was to be between 8 and 1 pm, really !  Then they call and said they an emergency and could make it around 130 pm. After this repair going to find someone a little more reliable.

Great burger and the Cobb salad with smashburger on top.  Sooo delicious and it was topped with a fried egg.  Quite large but I was able to handle it all, barely.

Good stuff tonight, had as the cookie crumbles.  Very delicious, it is a diabetics nightmare.  So good yet so sweet.  The sweet cream was over the top.  A friend had a chocolate with vanilla scoop of ice cream with chocolate covered nuts.  He was a little disappointed, thought the covered nuts would be different.  Still like the place and their wonderful selections.

Food and drinks were outstanding.   Went for restaurant week. The butternut squash ravioli was outstanding.   The zin short ribs were zinful.   Made the wrong choice for desert,  had berries and cream that was good, but lemon torte was fabulous.     For a high end restaurant was disappointed on the wait staff.  When plating they would cross over in front of someone's face, my favorite as someone was taking a bite they would reach over to take someone's plate.  Had to ask repeatedly to refill drinks and bring out an extra place setting.     That is the only reason for the four because the wait staff is an easy fix but the food, definitely will go back.

Always good food, but the beer is why we come here.  The beer and wine selection is great.  Would like a few more local beers and wines from bodega pierce would be a great added selection.

We were here for special function dinner. Fora catered event always put your best foot forward. Chip are good, salsa not exciting at all very bland.  Here's to hoping the meal is better. Food was not much better. Rice and beans good, cheese enchiladas and beef tacos ok.  Coke was really good.  Probably not a returney.

Lucky I love the coffee and staff, since the drive thru line takes forever.  20 minutes to get through not good.  Coffee is good though.

Thank you restaurant week and a HUGE thank you to Binks.  Tomato gazpacho was a meal in itself, the herb and paremessan focal Cia and olive oil blended so well.  Delicious.  Short rib lasagna had enough meat to not overpower.  Grilled Mahi Mahi grilled to perfection.   Desert was sour cherry clafoutis, omg.  What else can I say.  Definite will return.

This is what happens when you find a new place to try.  Nice restaurant and atmosphere is great.  Had the rooster booster, good stuff. My eggs were scrambled and fluffy.  So good.   My other half wanted his eggs over medium and they ran all over his plate.  He loved the scrambled much better. Will return.

Beer good, buffalo burger good, service ok, noise ugh, unbearable.   That is my only problem.   Never was part of the conversation as it was so loud.  Will wait until weather is cooler to go outside.

There were five of us.  I only gave them 4 stars because service was slow.  There was only one other couple there.  Lobster bisque and the combo sliders were outstanding.   French onion soup very good.  Impressed how good things were.  We will return.

To bad I have to give any stars.  Should had known when speaker was broken.  The all day menudo for Saturday and Sunday was not served in the evening.   Strike two.  I ordered my food and 27 minutes later finally got my three tacos de lengua.  I called three times and I asked where my food was, as I was asked to park at the neighboring business.  I opened them up and they were the most tasteless tacos ever.  The tortillas tasted like they had been warmed up in water. I went home so I could doctor them up.  Will never go back here and horrible experience.

Food as always was excellent!  Wings great, mac and cheese fabulous,  pork rinds great, still crackling when arrived at the table.  The French dip didn't like but was my fault forgot to order with no horse radish.   Beers were not as good as previous.   But will return.

So disappointed,  was here previously and food and drinks were good.  This time food was sub par.  We had the snack in the jar tasted like the costco bar food.  The server said we don't do the seasonings anymore.  The sliders was tasteless.   Now I know why the other places are down the street are busy and packed.  Probably won't return.

The service is impeccable. Ask for Darby. The back patio was so comfortable you never want to leave- it's like being in your own backyard. If you don't have a backyard, this can be yours. The prime rib French Dip was outstanding! There's even a dog -friendly menu! Oh, and Cigar Smokers in Glendale have a new home with their Cigar bar!

Costumer service poor as the waitress/ bar tender took 10 minutes to get us a menu as there was only 5 people around the bar.  The taco was bland had to put salt and pepper to make a little tasty as the food was  food bland.  My first drink a tequila sunrise was so sweet you could not tell if the tequila was even in the drink.  I ordered a soda and the first one was flat they said they had to change tanks, they brought me another soda and it was still flat.  At least they didn't charge me for the soda.  My friend had some coffee and said that it was a good cup.  Should have gone with the coffee. How this place will stay open until football season I don't know if service and food doesn't improve.

Had the classic, unless you like your cow still mooing, make sure you get it well done.  Great burgers, truffles fries are much better than other places and their sodas are all sugared naturally.  Good place will make the trip back.
