Wife and I had the opportunity to attend a YELP event ! The show was called "Circus Americana". Seating was great, don't believe there is a bad seat in the theater. Staff was very nice, bathrooms very clean. Parking is just across the street. Would like to come back and see other performances!

We really had a great time here, We were celebrating our oldest foster daughters 8th birthday. So my wife, our two foster kids, and myself met our daughter and her boyfriend here. We had a 6:30 reservation, we were actually there early. This is were I had the only problem of the evening. When we first arrived, I told them who I was and we are early. The hostess said that we were going to need to wait for our reservation time. While I was in shock, I asked her. So if we just walked in now and asked for a table, we would be seated now? This is when she said one moment so she can talked to her supervisor. She sat us when she came back and apologized. I told her there was no apology needed. She asked us if we needed them to keep the birthday cake Denise baked in storage which was very helpful. Natalie the birthday girl was in awe on the decor of the restaurant and very excited that we ate in the trolley. I ordered the gluten free baked chicken and pasta. It was better then I thought it was going to be. At my age, I am trying healthier food options. Although the chicken was a little dry, pasta was very good. The two girls had spaghetti and meat sauce and had no complaints from them. Not going into detail on what everyone else had, but there was no complaints from them either. When we were finished, they came out with the cake, ice cream, and sang Natalie the birthday song. I believe this is going to be a great memory for her. I know that Natalie never had the chance to experience things like this. Something that myself and very many people take for granted!   The food here is good, I have had better.  The service here was great, even with the little issue. The reason why I gave this place the 5-star, because it gave Natalie a time of her life!

One year later and another birthday for Natalie at her favorite restaurant. We had another great time here. This time I had their chicken Alfredo, and a salad. Meal was very good, kids had their usual spaghetti. Wife had the penne pasta, and we all thought the food was very good. Service were spectacular, and gave all five kids a free ice cream. Thanks for the great time again.

Been wanting to try Honey Bear's for a while, was planning to go visit Town Talk ll. But since I start work at 5:00am, and take lunch around 10:00 - 10:30. Town Talk doesn't open until 11:00, and Honey Bear's opens at 10:00! Honey Bear's sits right next to another of my favorites(Best of Philly).  When you walk in, there's a counter right in front of you. Menu is a little confusing, but just tell them what you want. Even though it was lunch, I had a half slab of pork ribs with potato salad. Their ribs are probably my second or third favorite ribs I have eaten. Ribs have a lot of meat, very good smoke taste, not the tenderest ribs I have had but nothing wrong with it. Potato salad was very good also, little different from what I am use to.  Price wise is about what is expected for ribs. Half slab of ribs(meaty), potato salad, order of fries, plus a drink. for about $20.00 Very happy with my meal, will diffidently come back.

Had a opportunity to bring a few of the family here last weekend! My baby big brother had the Big Unit and with help from all of us, I thought with the size this dog would have problems! Just because it's big! Doesn't mean it better! But this was not that bad. Wife and I shared an order of nachos, Daughter had her usual cheeseburger, son had an order of wings, which they are breaded, and was OK. Over all we had a great time. We will be coming back again!

Mom and Aunt were in town, my Aunt wanted to come here so on there way back home we all stopped off! Now I had no idea, that my 60 yr old aunt had the intention of ordering the Big Unit! I was shocked!!! Yes, we all had out share of it. But my Aunt Sue was game and actually ate most of it!! I had the Rob Zombie Burger! It was great, cheese burger with guac, salsa, and bacon!! All had a great time, and yes again, we will be back!!

Really a fun place for the kids to learn. Everything is interaction with the kids. Kids were willing to learn about science. Best thing about this place, parents can get involved also. The whole family is having a great time together. The attendees were very helpful and very nice. Only problem is, they will need to change things up. You can do the same thing over again for only so much. Overall great time,

It was daddy and daughter day. So I decided to bring her here since she loves cheeseburgers! We both had a cheeseburger w/potato salad. NOTE: They do not serve fries!!!! Service is a little slow, but we received our order very fast. We both enjoyed our burgers very much! Very juicy, and cooked perfect! I really liked the potato salad, the daughter is very hard to please! She liked the potato's but she had to pick through the rest of the ingredients! She was ecstatic about being able to create her own shake! She ordered a banana and cheesecake shake, she usually only eat part of it and give the rest away! I was lucky enough to at least try it before she consumed the whole thing!!! Very tasty! I had their fresh lemonade, this was probably the best lemonade I have ever had!!! We really enjoyed this place and definitely will bring mama here.

Just wanted a pizza for delivery! The hotel recommended them, and I was quite happy. We ordered a garlic chicken calzone, chicken tenders, potato skins, and minestrone soup. We were very happy with the delivery time and food. Would buy from again!

Recently had my fathers memorial service here, with the help from Jean Green. I couldn't have asked for anything more! I really felt good afterwards, a beautiful church, gorgeous chapel, Rev. Greg Mengay was stiller, and the ladies who volunteered their time at the banquet room was great. Even though it was a sad day, St Joan of Arc really made it a lot easier! We used the small chapel with out knowing how many people would show up, Jean made it clear if more then hundred people showed up it would be no problem to move everything to the large chapel. After the service everyone went to the banquet room which was only about 100 feet away from the chapel. We were able to put on a slide show, play music, and was allowed to say a few words to everyone. Food and drinks were provided, and we were allowed to bring our own. Jean, thank you for your hard work.

Had some tamales, and they were one of the worst I have ever had! There is no way this place is the best in town? Now I am not condemning this place, I will come back and give them another try. I will try something different and maybe I might change my mind. But I just don't get the hype!

Love this place, only lived in the Phoenix area for a year and have already been here at least ten times. First, if you are picking up family. They have two cell parking lots! You can park there and wait for your guest to call you when they fly in. Then just do a drive by to pick them up! Very easy!! With the way security is now, there is no reason to park in the parking lot and come inside to wait for who ever you are picking up. TSA check point is not that bad at all when you are flying out. I love this place!

Wasn't to happy with the cleanliness of this location. The floor needed mopping and had a lot of flies. Wanted to give the kids apples with their kids meal, however they only had enough for one? I ordered a chicken salad, and they were out of the salad dressing that comes with the salad.  Noticed a lot of transient traffic at this location. We all still ate, and it was fine.

What a place! And no one even knows it's here! In the middle of these million dollar cars. There is a museum with a great collection of Indy 500 winners. If you know your racing, this place is for you. There are cars that were driven by Tom Sneva, Gil De Ferran, Mark Donohue, Rick Mears, Bobby Unser, Danny Sullivan, and much more! Now they are begining to add more NASCAR's! I'll be back with my nephew!

Family was out late, wanting to get out of the house. Mama had a gift card from AMC. Did not want to stop by West Gate! Coyotes had a game and it was going to be crowded! So we ended up in Mesa! Watched a movie around 10:00pm, very nice snack bar, just like anywhere else. Price is going to be a little high! Popcorn was great, and fresh! Seating were very comfortable. Over all we had a great time! Do not know if we will ever come back since we live in the West Valley!!! (West Side!!) But it was a great experience.

This was a cool place, sure it's a tourist trap! What do you expect people!! When you walking down main street, the buildings make you wonder about the old wild west days. It's really neat. The first building you walk into is their candy and fudge store! Boy, I spent most of my money their. Fudge was awesome, and you will find some candy that will bring back memories! (If you still have any) This place have a variety of places to visit, they also have three tours, we only went on the train. The train was nice, it's only goes around the town and tells you stories of the past. Hey Taryn C., pull your head out of you liberal ass and smell the roses! No one cares what hell your saying! (trying to keep this clean) Sounded like someone pissed in your cheerios that day? There are tourist traps all over New York, so lay off! When it's all said and done, I had a good time. And will bring my family over to visit.

Couple of friends and I had a great time here. We played the Devils Claw course. It's well maintained, greens are fast, rough is not that bad. That's a big deal if you golf like myself. This is a desert course with sand traps and some water, not much trees. We did lose plenty of balls, so bring plenty. I personally think it's worth the price, however I understand if others do not agree. Staff are very nice, they have plenty of rentals available in case you are in town and need clubs. Their pro shop is well stocked, plenty of choices to choose from. We did not try their food. This is a course I would like to visit again, it was a lot of fun.

What a remarkable place. A friend referred this place since we have foster kids. We are always looking for something new to experience. Luckily we were their on the last night of Christmas lights. We purchased four all day rides passes. They were ten dollars each. So if you're planning to ride on the rides more then a few times. Its well worth it. There are three rides. There is a carousel, little train ride, and even a littler train ride. Don't worry, adults can fit on them also. And the kids would love having you ride with them. They also have a couple of great museums and a awesome model train exhibit.  It doesn't cost you anything to enter the park. And if you just want to enjoy the park itself, they have picnic benches with BBQ's, and two playgrounds. There is also a snack shop, and a ice cream shop.  If you ever have the opportunity to watch the Christmas lights during the holidays. It's a must see! This place really knows how to put on a decoration show. We all loved it. But you must be there around 5:30 to wait in line, because the line will get large. We had a great Christmas, and this place was a great ending!

Wife and I stopped here after attending a D-Back game. It was Sunday around 5:00pm. Not busy at all, we were seated very quickly. After waiting for a little time we were finally served water and asked for our drinks. Right away I asked if we can order one of their sliders so we can try it before our dinner. Waiter said no problem. Now their sliders are very good, It's like a whole meal in a bun! Don't know how anyone can eat their 12 sliders challenge! NO WAY!! Wife had their crispy chicken wrap, I had their all you can eat ribs. Wife's wrap was awesome! Very tasty, and her side dish of potato salad was just as good!! Their ribs were OK, not much meat, very fatty, even though I packed away 13 ribs!! Mom, it sounds worst than it is!! There just weren't that much meat! No wonder it's all you can eat! Now I am writing this review the next mourning and I can still feel the wrath of the ribs!! I will definitely go back. They have way too much items on their menu for us not to go back. But I will not longer order their ribs again.

Took our daughter and her boyfriend out for dinner, she wanted to try Marello's? When I seen the prices, I knew then why she haven't tried them yet! But after being seated, we had a very nice young lady as our server. She took her time to explain all of the day's specials, told us exactly what it was. Started off with their bread, it's a marinara sauce bread with herbs and garlic. You can dip them in vinegar and balsamic. I ordered their  CHICKEN AND SAUSAGE PEPPERONCINI, I very much enjoyed this. It had a bite, but not enough to ruin it. Love their garlic and pepperoncini sauce. Wife had a pepperoni, and bell pepper pizza. Of course I had a slice, she asked for it to be well done(like it crispy). When she got the pizza, it was not crispy? But it was very good still. Daughter had the chicken parmigiana, and her boyfriend had the godfather pizza. I did not have a chance to get a sample of their plates, but they must have liked it since they had no left overs. Now the first thing I said to my wife was they had small portions, and for the price I thought their portions were not enough. But after eating I totally changed my mind, it wasn't about quantity, it was about quality. It was well worth it, planning to go their again when we visit our kid!

Because we are foster parents. Any children below the age of six, we must have a pool fence. Create A Curb was recommended by our fence installer. We needed 50 feet of curb installed, 20 ft of it was added in the last minute. There was no issues, very professional crew. Did the job in one day, matched the color I wanted, and have had no issues since the job was completed.

Total Joke! A place for kids to smoke! Even if you just want to play pool, you have to deal with all of the smoke and immature people. For some reason a few people think hookah is cool, but for each is their own! This place can really be a great place if it was serious!

This was probably one of the worst Walmart I have ever been to. Inventory was very low, everything was out of order. And the biggest issue was trying to find someone who works there! I could have lived with the mess, customers act like the own the place and just throw things around. But when your're trying to find something with no success. It would be nice to have some help.  Now this place is huge, one of those Super Walmart. One stop store that has both retail and grocery. Getting out was pretty easy, just went to one of the self check out. Not a big fan of the big box stores, but this location has a lot of issues.

Trader Joe's! What can I say, it's one of those make me feel good stores? Trader Joe's knows how to make you think you are doing something good just by shopping at their store. You start thinking how good you are by eating organic, even though you can't afford to. But it works! And I do enjoy going there.

I've came here a couple of times. Nothing special here, just another big name franchise. You can tell they try to cater the younger customers. Never been a big fan of this franchise, but will come back to try something new or meet up with someone? Food is usually salty and not much flavor. There is a lot of other options out there for you to try instead.

Funny how much I love Outback, but only ate a meal at one of their locations just a few times? I have always enjoyed Outback, It's different with a kick in the flavor. Last time I tried this location, I was amazed at how many customers were their! We had to come back and place a reservation. Steaks are just awesome, service was great, have no problems with this location.

It took us a while to find some good pizza parlors in this area. Now in the last few months we have found some! We were not sure if we wanted to try this place? It was empty, and the crew was just sitting around doing nothing! So we went in, I ordered the pepperoni and bell pepper pizza well done. Wife order their spaghetti and meatballs. Unless my mom made the spaghetti, I'm not eating it! Their pizza was very good, the sauce had a lot of flavors, not sure about the crust yet. But the pizza is well worth an other visit!

This place is awesome! Yes we are a little young to play bingo all the time, and yes there are a lot of older senior citizens here. But this facility is great. Outside it looks like a run down steam boat, it's kind of cute. But inside it's really has a nice set up. More than enough room to be comfortable, a snack shop that has decent food. Volunteers roaming the room to make sure you are taken care of. Best thing about this, they do this for charity. In Cali we always went to churches for bingo, but this is a new breath of fresh air.

Throughout the years, we have enrolled some of our foster kids here. Very convenient for the kindergarten kids. Tutor time does not pick up kindergarten kids since they are only half days. Above and beyond will pick them up if your child is enrolled at Willow Springs. Only problem I have is they do not discipline the kids enough. They are to nice. We have had some foster kids with behavior issues. When they acted up at day care, they are still allowed to participate in activities that day. Some times you need to take that away. But overall, the crew are very nice, lots of activities for the kids.

Finally found a way to get the girls to a seafood restaurant! Have people give us Red Lobster gift cards!!! Wife and daughter does not like seafood, will the wife doesn't! Daughter just copies her on everything!! I, do like seafood! I'm just not able to ever get a chance to eat any! So we just recently ate here, wife had a steak, I ordered the shrimp jambalaya! You have to realize, I may not be a good person to review seafood! Because, I am not able to eat it enough to know whats good and whats bad! I was just happy to be there! Wife did like her steak, and like their dinner rolls a lot. So when ever someone gives us another gift card, we will be back!

When I was going to school in the Phoenix area about 25 yrs ago!!! I was a regular customer at the local Peter Piper Pizza! It was no big deal, when you are on a college budget! A $4.99 large pizza would last me all weekend! Now our 5 yr old nephew was visiting us from Cali, we took him to our local fine Italian establishment! It reminds me a lot of Chuck E Cheese! He had a great time, played all of the games, spent all of our money, and you know what! The pizza wasn't to bad either! I really expected the worst, left there really impressed.

Yes! I gave Peter Piper Pizza a 5-star! I can't believe that myself.  This story starts back in 1985, this is when I was going to school in Glendale. Being on a very tight budget, I could only afford the Burger King Whopper at 99 cents each and a large pizza from Piper Piper at $4.99. It got be through 2-1/2 years of school! All I could remember was how bad the pizza was. Now fast forward 29 years(wow, am i getting old). Last night we had a great opportunity to meet our foster kids for the first time! Now they could have gone anywhere, heck I was trying to get them to choose a nice restaurant. But it did not work, they wanted Peter Piper Pizza. So all four of us(wife included) went off to Piper Land, I laid down a 40 spot for a Large Pepperoni Pizza, half with Jalapeno's the seven year old likes it spicy like me! Order of hot wings(did I mentioned the 7 yr old likes it spicy like me), 4 drinks, two ice creams, and 40 tokens. Before I even sat down the six year old was out of tokens already?? So luckily the food actually came out fast, we all sat down had a great dinner. Had a chance to ask questions about each other. Then I realized something, their pizza wasn't that bad! I could not believe how good it was! I guess that 29 years of practice actually works. So overall we had an amazing night, brought back memories of our own grown kids when they were young. We will probably have many more visits here, and I don't have a problem with that any longer.

Been here a few times, had a couple of my rifles cleaned. I have purchased a couple of ear muffs. But mostly I have just browsed here. Prices don't seem to be that bad. Comparing some of their prices with the recent gun show, their prices are very reasonable. When I have been here, they have been very nice and informative. Answered every questions I have had.  They offer safety classes, but are done at the Ben Avery shooting range. I will continue to come here, and will probably end up purchasing a fire arm from them

Not a very good branch, was happy they had a minute clinic! But noticed a huge line for the pharmacy. They also had a huge line at the check out booth. People there were very annoyed, and getting frustrated. When we had to wait for the minute clinic, the waiting area was very messy. Not blaming the staff, management had this place very understaffed.

This is one of my wife's favorite place to shop, we can be here for hours if we don't watch out!!! Neat place, find things you don't normally find anywhere else. Prices can be high at times! Employees are always nice, and helpful. When you go, do not forget their coupons!!! you can't miss them!

First time here, had a great day. Son was in town so we seen the offer for unlimited golf and a free meal for $30.00. Well worth it. Greens were in great shape, fairways were fine also. Probably would have never played here if it wasn't for the special. Regular price is a bit high for the quality of golf. Surprised with the amount of trees. It's a bit narrow with all of the mobile homes around. Some bad areas in the rough, however still a good course.

I really do not know why I haven't shop here at Lowes more often? Every time I come here, they have everything I need, and their prices are very reasonable. I usually go to Ace, and Home Depot. Only because they are closer to home. But for now on, I will make more of an effort to shop here.

First time we tried this location, brought all seven of us. Had a great time. When we placed our order for five children's popcorn, snack, and icee's. Plus mine and the wifes soda and popcorn. They actually helped us carry everything for us to our theater! Theater was very clean, service was great. Will come back again.

When you're reviewing a franchise there isn't much you can say differently then the rest of them. This location is fine, I have never had a problem with Red Robin. Food is always decent, service is always good. Always enjoyed their grill chicken salad. Burgers is never a bad option.

I don't give out a lot of five stars, however wife and I had a very delightful experience. We have been meaning to visit this place for years, and we finally did. This place is a lot larger than it looks from the outside. So we didn't have to wait to be seated at all. They have this place decorated as if you were eating outside. Service was very prompt, and very friendly. I ordered the chicken parmesan. Spaghetti was good, sauce is not running like a lot of restaurants. Sauce is very good. The chicken was very thick, juicy, and crispy. Just plain out good. Wife had the baked zitti, and enjoyed it very much. Prices were very reasonable. We had a great time, and will definitely come back again.

Ever since I tried Whataburger for the first time is Texas, they have been one of my favorites. Since there wasn't any in SoCal, I was very happy when I relocated to the Valley that there were plenty of Whataburgers to pass around!! Been here a few times, never had any problems! But then again, I don't expect to much from a fast food joint! Plenty of parking, and seating inside. Service has been good, sometimes the drive through can be slow. Their food is better then most other fast food joints, but you do pay for it.

Had a coupon for this restaurant. So after out foster kids therapy and on our way home we stopped by for dinner. There was a hand written sign on the door announcing they will be closing at 7:00 pm. Now we got there around 6:40, but they had no problem with us coming in and knowing we would have a party of seven.  We ordered a large pepperoni pizza, their Chicago style. Now this is where I have a problem understanding. I thought thin crust pizza was New York style, deep dish was chcago? Now I was just in Chicago a few weeks ago and had a Lou Malnatis deep dish and that was amazing. Anyway fuzzy offers a thin crust Chicago style pizza. We really liked their pizza, loved the spicy sauce, and you can really taste the cheese. We also had the Italian beef sandwich, mac and cheese for Naomi, spaghetti and meatballs for Natalie, hot dog for Nathan, chicken fingers for Neci, and Kailey wanted to eat pizza and wings with me. I really can't complain about anything here. The food was great, especially the beef sandwich and pizza. The employees was great and did not rush us even though we were there after closing. Just was warning, give your food a little time to cool off. They are served piping hot. Great time, great service, and great food.

Wife and I had some some time to waste before daughters performance. So we had something small to eat at Anita's.  1st) Chip and Salsa: Chips were greasy and rubbery? Don't know how this is capable! But they did it! 2nd) Shredded beef taco, green chili tamale plate: Rice tasted like a uncle Ben's rice out of the box. Beans were OK, didn't quite like the taste. Both were way to salty. I however did like their taco, beef was reasonable seasoned. 3rd) Water: Now after sharing this plate I was drinking water. Now during the meal, I noticed the glass was dirty. All this time I thought it was from me? Turns out it was inside the glass.  I will never come back here again, even though everyone was very friendly, and our service was decent.

No doubt this was the best burger I have had in a very long time! My mom, wife, and myself were on our way to Prescott and stopped here for lunch. I had their BBQ western burger, have to admit. This is a great burger! Very fresh patties, very seasoned. I would come back here again just for that.

We just recently visit this place again! What can I say, I will continue to come by when we are in town. Every time here I'll try something different. It just gets better.

Here for a birthday party. So there will be a lot of credit cards on tab. So you would think they would ask for ID when you close the tab. Well they don't! Well, they gave my credit card to someone else? Then they got defensive when u question their procedure of closing a tab without proof of ID.

Took the family to the museum, wasn't that impressed with it at first. Went through a bunch of rooms, seen a lot of different types of art. Yes they had Andy Warhol paintings there. But not what I was looking for. When I thought we were done, we found a stair case that took us up stairs. There we found the paintings that I was looking for. All old classic oil paintings. They were amazing! That was worth it. Glad we went.

It really depend on what you expect. This was my first time at Comerica. We had the opportunity to see the Moscow ballet nut cracker. The show itself was amazing, however the theater had some issue.  Usually when I go watch a show like this. It's formal and the theater does a good job keeping control of the audience. I was surprised to see a snack bar and on top of that, you're allowed to bring in food and beverages inside. Now im saying this is bad, just not what I was expecting. The ushers could have done a better job with some of the rude and loud people.  We still had a great time, we did have popcorn and drinks. Prices are reasonable and the snacks were decent. Parking is close but everyone is leaving at the same time, only one way in and one way out so expect a wait to get out. Absolutely recommend coming here.

Family and I really enjoyed this place, luckily we came by during off peak hours. I have driven by at times and the parking lot was full. But it has a great environment, burgers were very good, fries and onion rings were great. Overall we had a great time and we will come by again.

Very cool place to eat at! Like all of the history, the news paper hanging on the wall near the cash register kept me busy for at least 1/2 hour! Couldn't imagine how it was back then reading about WWII ! Any way! back to the food, I was in the mood for a quick sandwich near work. So I asked for yelp! Once again yelp did it's job!!!! Had a grilled chicken sandwich on sesame seed roll, it was really good! Sandwich is large so plan on taking half back home or share with your buddy? This is definitely a come back location.

This was probably the worst hotel location I have ever stayed at. The rooms were nice, but the plumbing was awful! The toilet flushed very slow, and the drain in the shower was also very slow. Then the house keepers did not clean the restrooms, they only changed towels and made the beds! Did not take out the trash either. This place needs a lot of changes before I'll ever come back.

Drive by this place every morning on my way to work. Never had a urge to eat here until recently. I knew what I was walking into just by looking at this place. Do not know how this place stays in business? Never see any business there! i ordered a breakfast burrito, it had eggs, sausage, and potatoes. Nothing special, something I could have made up at home. This is my opinion, when you have a restaurant. You should serve food that has something special. Not food, we can serve up at home. Give me a reason to return!! The location is very out dated, needs a new coat of paint and get rid of all the pictures. There are too many options in this area to eat at. This place really needs to change. But I doubt if they will!

Only reason why I grab something from KFC was for their new Nashville Hot chicken. Something new and wanted to try it. When I arrived, I planned to go through the drive through. However it was about eight deep. So I went ahead and parked so I could go inside. But I was about the fifth in line. There was only one person servings walk ins. You can imagine how long this took. There was about five workers there. One to service drive through, one servicing walk ins, and three to cook and bag the food. Sounds simple right! The manager should have help direct and help with the food. Instead she was the one serving walk ins. Now when I finally got my food. The new Nashville Hot Chicken was actually pretty good. The biscuit was good, but the coleslaw was that good? Did they change it? Hardly eat at KFC anymore, so it doesn't taste the same as in the past.  Here's my deal with fast food. Is these an easy job? Not really, thats why no one wants this job. However I don't want to hear that they deserve $15.00 an hour. Hell, most managers don't deserve that. This place is way to slow. Workers need to show some effort, and manager needs some training.

Finally had a chance to try this place after a year driving by it. Glad I did! had their Philly Cheese steak. Meat was a good quality sliced very thin. Great taste, people there were very polite. You just need to get their during the off peak hours. When they are busy it's very hard to find parking. But it's still worth it.

I had nothing but a great experience with Hertz! I was involved in a little fender bender, luckily no one was hurt! My insurance gave me an option between Budget, Enterprise, or Hertz? I went ahead with Hertz since I have never used them before.  I had their car for about a month, just like any other rent a car I had an option with a mid-size or luxury. Since My insurance covered 80% of the rental I went cheap and picked the mid-size. they also gave me an option to purchase gas at a set price or just fill it up when I bring it back.  Glad I pre-purchased the gas, fuel was about 25 cents higher a month later!(every penny counts) It was an easy check out, a do it yourself damage sheet. Now when My truck was delayed, and I was expecting to have it back in time for our trip to SoCal. I had to upgrade the car for room purposes. It was an easy, just show up and exchange the cars. When It was time to pick up my truck, all I had to do was leave it at the repair facility. Hertz picked it up them self. Everything was easy, no problems, and I will probably use them again when needed.

I have been here a few times. I try not to visit any fast food franchises, however I did wanted to try out the new buttermilk chicken sandwich. Well can't be any surprise. Not that good. Chicken really didn't have any flavor and if it did. The excess of mayonnaise kind of blasted it away. Service sucked, still can't believe they want $15.00 per hour. When I arrived there at 11:00, drive through was six deep. Then when I was trying to pay, the guy was trying to take an order at the same time. Not a good idea!  Can't really complain to much, it's McDonald's.

Just transplanted from SoCal! I have been staying over at my fathers house. He took me here for dinner one day. He used to play with his band here years ago with the owner. The food here is awesome, I have had their pork carnitas, and their steak picado. Both plates were great. I will come back here more often.

On my way to see pops, had some extra time and had lunch here. I ordered their steak fajitas! Since wife hates this dish!(the smell), and she wasn't with me!!! That's what I ordered! The carne asada steak was awesome, really loved this plate. Comes with beans and rice, both were good. Chips were ok, didn't really liked the salsa. But that's not why I came here for! Great restaurant, will come back again.

I have always enjoyed Whataburger, this location is near my work. I usually bring left overs from home. But sometimes I get lucky and get to eat out!! As I say this time and time again. A fast food franchise is just that! So my expectation is not that high! I love their chicken BBQ sandwich! I get this every time I eat at Whataburger. You can compare this to the Carl's Jr BBQ chicken sandwich. Fries are a little salty at times, so I usually ask for no salt. Service was just fine, prices are a little higher? But you are not getting a Big Mac!! This will always be an option for me.

Just a little dive on Indian School Rd. with a lot of history. Now I might have been born here, but I grew up in SoCal! My father was born and raised here, never leaving this area. He had told me a story how as a little boy is mother sent him to the neighbors to get some tamales. As it turns out it was Sylvia? He was a devoted customer and has brought some of their food home to share with me. I really enjoyed their tamales and chili Verde! Wife and daughter enjoys their enchiladas, their sauce is almost like a mole sauce. Over all, very good food, location is not that great, but don't be scared!

We have been here a few times and never had any issues. We only come here when we are in the area. Not to confuse this place with the Original Garcia's further south on 35th ave. This location is very good, I have been to others that have not been as good.  I have had there nachos, tacos, grilled chicken. Everything has always been good, kids loved it last time, and wife has no problem coming here. The service has always been great, never have to ask for anything. Seems like every time we come here they have their nite club going on. So it can get loud up front. My two favorite mexican restaurants are Rio Mirage in Surprise, and The Original Garcia's in Phoenix. However, this location is right up their with them.

Our visit wasn't bad at all. We were in the area for some foster parenting training. Stopped by for a quick bite to eat. We walked right in, gave our order. And what I like about Carl's Jr, they will deliver your food to you at your table. Everyone was nice, received our food pretty quickly. Place was very clean. I tried their limited time only bourbon BBQ burger, very good. Other then that, food is like any other fast food franchise. It's OK. We had a good experience here.

Wife and I have been on three different lake boat cruise! The Desert Belle in Saguaro Lake is the best one so far!!! Some times we just need to get away, and enjoy! This is a 90 min cruise, and has some of the most beautiful scenery around! Learned a lot on this cruise, about the history and about the volcanic rocks near by. Boat holds about 147 people, 47 inside! Has a snack bar, not food!! But you can purchase food at the restaurant and bring on board!!! Snack bar is more of a bar!! lol. Has a lot of booze, with snacks. Does have water and soda! This something I am really thinking about coming back for a dinner cruise?  Over all we had a great time!

Wanted to take my honey out for her birthday, and noticed a special on travel zoo! Even though my wife is not much about going to a more "classier" restaurant, I was able to talk her into it!! So we put our good clothes on and applied our good perfume or cologne and made our way out to Scottsdale. We arrived about twenty minutes early, but we were seated within minutes. We ordered the chicken scaloppini, and the special of the day Steak and mashed potatoes. We also had the baby mixed green salad. We both loved the salad, especially the roasted garlic vegetable dressing. The steak was cooked to perfection, mashed potatoes were excellent, I actually enjoyed the steamed vegetables. The chicken was alright, since the wife does not like mushrooms, we asked to use a different sauce. I would have loved to try it with the original mushroom sauce!!! Overall we had a different experience we normally do not have, we enjoyed it very much. I am glad my wife had a great time, I knew I was taking a chance but it was worth it. Thanks Razz! For a great time! The only reason we did not give a five star rating was based on the amount of time waiting for our waiter. Even though everyone were very nice, our waiter was very slow on replenishing our water and soda! Yes I said soda! I would come here more often, but it would have to be from a special or coupon.

Daughter and I have been wanting to check this place out since we seen one in Mesa! So the family was in the area. (picking mommy's necklace up at Tiffany's) Noticed on the way to the FWY there was a Charleston's. I have checked this place out on the web, and only thought this was just a ribs, and burger joint. Something we all have been to. Boy was I wrong! I ordered their grilled pork chops, with garlic mash, and glazed carrots. Pork chops were awesome, cooked will done, with garlic and butter on top. I would order again anytime. Their garlic mash was very good, and mommy loved the glazed carrots. Daughter had the 1/2 ribs with fries, the meat was just falling off the bones, had plenty of meat. Wife had a cheese burger, with a salad. She loved the salad, and burger was good. Overall we had a great time, it does cost a little bit more. But it was well worth it!!

We only stopped by, because of the hour long wait for Lo-Lo's just a few doors down. i had their orange peel smoothie, daughter had some kind of Hawaii drink? But it was better than mine!! overall it was a good experience! They need more chairs inside, got us out pretty fast and greeted us when we walk in.

Had dinner with the girls before our Evita engagement at the ASU Gammage. We only had about 45 minutes until the show starts. They got us in and out really fast, this is when they were busy! Wife and I shared their triple platter, came with burger sliders, potato wedges, and their chipotle boneless wings. Very good! Glad we opt to eat here, their crew were very courteous, and knew we had a time limit and got us out!

*ROTD 1/1/2014* Had a great time. Me and the family had an opportunity to watch Evita last night. Never been to a place with so much leg room. Looks like there is no bad seats. Workers are very nice and courteous. A great night with a great woman on her birthday.

always liked fudruckers, my favorite is a cajun chicken sandwich. have not been on their menu for a while. it's a grilled chicken sandwich with grilled onions, pepper jack cheese, and a cajun sauce. this has been my favorite for years. of course you have to have their fries with the jalapeno cheese sauce. this location is a little dirty, but they have a lot of customers coming in and out. had a great meal with the family.

Just like any tech school, you will only learn the basics. Then you have to grow up and learn the trade on the job! Place really gave me a direction of where I want to go in life. Not saying this is the best place to go, it was hard. But life is hard!

Sucks that I had to give such a low rating! But my mom said so!! When my mother was visiting us from Cali last week, I brought her to see the light at Glendale. Now originally I was born in Glendale, but was raised in Long Beach! So when we drove by Pete's, my mom had me make a u-turn right to there location. She said as a child her and her sister use to come by all the time and loved it. She mentioned how large the fish use to be, and how good it was. Well, time has changed and she was very upset how bad it is now! The chicken tenders were OK, but the fish and shrimp was to greasy, and taste was lousy. Looks like another mom and pops place that just grew to large and forgot why they were their in the first place. Always happens when the kids and grand kids take over.

I have had the opportunity to watch games at the Staples Center, and Honda Center in Los Angeles and Anaheim. Both are great arenas and are very fan friendly. Jobing.com is totally different, and that's not a bad thing! I really enjoy the arena is in the same complex with restaurants and movie theater. Great place to hang out before and after the game. Parking is great, I actually had a parking pass and did not use it. I just parked at the west gate parking lot. The arena was very easy to acess, and we had a great time. We will be coming back many more times.

Really do not know how to rate this place?  We were out shopping around for a pinata, we are having a birthday party for both of our foster daughters. A & C had a very small selection of pinatas, they were nice but not what we were looking for.  Now with that said, this place is very small but offers so much. You can rent chairs, tables, bouncers, and much more. They have plenty of party supplies to offer. I would love to have a business like this where we live. However they didn't have what we needed, so with that only reason this is why it's getting a 4-star. The people in this area doesn't realize what they have over here, it's a great place to have locally.

Don't have many choices for night time! Summer hours are open until 10:00 pm, have plenty of room, can accommodate a lot of people. Huge selection of equipment in the pro shop. Just  wished I lived closer.  This is a two stories range, has about 60 stations. Love the new track tee, tracks your ball speed and ball distance. One of the best driving range I have ever been to. Place might be a little pricey! But you can't complain with all the added features.   1) Self serving tees 2) Track tee technology 3) 60 stations 4) Huge pro shop 5) Great condition  I do go to the local driving ranges during the day, but during the evenings, this place is it!

Were new in town, and New Years Eve was approaching us and I was looking into going some where this year. So I had a lot of ideas, then my daughter mentioned the AMF Peoria Lanes  were offering a new years eve party. So we decided to attend this year. We really had a lot of fun! This was a great place to bring your young ones and spend your New Year Eve with them. Service was great and very friendly. I have no problem attending this every year.

I am actually a Filiberto's fan, however this location just doesn't do it for me. Every time I have ordered from here. There food just doesn't have much flavor. I always drive by them on my way to work, like the idea that they are opened 24 hrs. But there are too many choices to choose from (three by the time I hit the 101 fwy) to settle on their food.

I drive by here five times a week on my way to work! Since my hours changes during daylight savings. I can only stop here 6 months out of the year. The other 6 months they are still closed. I go to work at 5:00am!! Glad I was able to finally try K-May. When I first seen the reviews on yelp, I thought OK, something wrong here! All the reviews are five stars!!! Bring up the red flag, but I had to add another five stars! Walked in, they were just starting to bring out the donuts, had a apple fritter and a cinnamon roll! WOW! were the fresh, just melt in your mouth. Now no! I am not going to stop by here all the time, even though I would love to! I have been told that donuts are not good for me!! But yes, when I feel like I am going to take a chance! This is the place to go!

I drive by here twice a day five times a week, going to and coming from work. Been here a few times, I usually purchase donuts here, they are very good, when I get there in the morning(Which is very early). I don't have a great selection, since they are still working on the donuts. Since they have a very large selection of cakes, pastries, cookies, bread, and donuts. Wife and myself needs to stop by and check everything else out. Only reason I only gave it four stars, Twice I have wanted OJ, and both times they were currently out of. No biggie, will be there again.

Since the west valley doesn't offer more choices, I really can't complain much. With the small amount of space they have, they sure have a lot of inventory! The workers are really nice, and always checking to see if you need any help. I wanted to try out a certain iron, no problem at all. I grabbed an 8-iron and went to there hitting area, and took a few swings.  One thing I really liked about this location is the employees really took the time to talk with you, made you feel welcomed! Because of that, when I am ready for a new set of irons, they will be getting my business.  Funny when I started this review I gave them a 3-star rating, but by the time I finished it. I raised it to a 4-star rating! Looks like I talked my self into giving them a better review. Even though I am a big fan of Golfsmiths, this place isn't to bad at all.

What  can I say about this place, it's like any other Ace Hardware. Not going to be the cheapest. But it always gets you out of a pinch. This location is conveniently located at the west side of Surprise. This area is in the middle of growing, and eventually there will probably have a big box hardware store built in this area soon.  I like coming here only because I don't feel like driving to Grand  for Lowe's or Home Depot. Most of the time, Ace has what I am looking for. They actually have hard to find items that Lowe's or Home Depot does not have. Is Ace Hardware better then Lowe's or Home Depot? NOT! But I have no problem with them, always great service, always convenient,

Wanted to try this place for a while! Finally had the opportunity this past week end, we actually went there twice in the same day! Wife and I ate here after Church for breakfast. We had eggs, home potatoes, bacon, pancakes, and a small order of biscuit and gravy. Food was great, biscuit and gravy was one of the best we have had! Gravy had a very good and unique taste? Kind of tasted like chicken sausage gravy? We cleaned our plates and brought home the daughter a cheese burger. That  same night we came back for dinner, wife and I really like the way, the burgers looked. So I had their bacon burger deluxe. Burger was very good, their 1000 island dressing was also better than usual! Over all we had a great time, family loved their burgers and we will start coming back more often.

Moore Law Firm has been by my side for the last eight months. My father passed away early last year, and when a lawyer was needed. Moore Law Firm was recommended to me. Matthew Gobbato has been my probate lawyer and has done a great job. From Kelli the receptionist, and Carolyn the probate paralegal, to Matthew. All have been very courteous, and very helpful from day one.  Now that we can see the light at the end of the tunnel, things are beginning to roll pretty quickly now. They have taken care of everything, and been very involved with every step of the way. Always there to take my questions, basically have been there for me. I am diffinetly going to use them on future endeavors, and will feel very confident it will be taken care of with every effort used.

Wife and I have been here a few times. Always left satisfied! 1st - Cash only! Might be a inconvenience, but not enough to take away a star.  2nd - They do not serve fries. Again, might be a inconvenience to some?  With that said, I would have love to have chili fries. Their food is great!  I love their chili, has a little bite, bursting with flavor. Their burgers are really good also. They don't have a large menu, don't need it. Its a simple bar and grill dive. I do wish they would stay open late on race night at the nearby Canyon Speedway. We don't come here all the time, but try to once in awhile.

Not to impressed with this place. Its a run down bar and the only reason why I was here. Because of naked pizza. Stock isn't that great, had four out of five taps empty. Half of their slots on the bar wasn't working. Service is good and very nice. Hope naked pizzas business won't get hurt because if this place?

This place really came through for us. Wasn't sure if we were even going till the day before. So on our way to vegas we were calling around for rooms. However most of the hotels were full, and the ones that weren't were very pricey. So I hit my trip advisor and Tuscany came up! I never even heard of them. So I checked their reviews and they were decent so I reserved a couple of nights.  THE GOOD: Price was decent. Very clean Location near the strip Great restaurants in the casino And the rooms are discreet away from the casino itself THE BAD: Ask for the top floor, you can hear the people walking around. THE UGLY: Nothing really  Found a gem, and will become a permanent customer.

One thing I learned about Mexican food, is LEAVE IT ALONE!!! Border Grill tries to take Mexican food to the next level? Why! All they did is screwed it up! I will take a taco from the local taco shop any day before I come back here again. First they will give you a very salty chips and salsa, we asked for some with no salt and their reply was sorry but they put salt when they get out of the fryer! Then they will charge you for water! WHAT!! Because it was filtered water. BIG DEAL! We ordered their taquitos, tacos, tortilla soup. Seems like they do not understand how Mexican food should taste like! Just being there for a few minutes I already know what they are trying to do? They are trying to make them self a higher class then any other Mexican restaurant! Sorry but this place just can't cut it! Come down to Phoenix, San Diego, or Los Angeles. And your local mom and pops taco shack will turn this place out!!

If you have the power to write what every you want with out any recourse. You need to be responsible. I am still learning this, just because I don't like something. Doesn't mean someone else won't like it! After posting a 1-star review on Border Grill, their management messaged me and asked for me to come back again. They were willing to make it right. When a restaurant is reaching out and trying to make right. You have to give it to them. Now I did tell them, I probably will not go back. Because I am rarely at the Mandalay Bay! But I did appreciate the offer! So! I am going to add another star, I am still not impressed with their food, and we might have been their  on a bad day for them. That does happen!

I was very amazed by this place. Came to town thinking big deal, watching a game in a dome. Boy was I wrong, besides low prices for parking, game tickets and food. Stadium is beautifully and a fun place to watch a game. I recommend you to schedule a tour before the game, especially if you have kids! Too bad the local fans do not support their team. There were only 24,000 at the game, maybe 12,000 were angels fans. I will come back again!!

FINALLY!  I was able to have the Chino Bandido experience! I have been wanting to eat here for a while. I just happened to be in the area, so I had to stopped by this historic place!  First, when you walk in, you have the wall!! All of the press clippings, picture of Guy, and awards! Basically just bragging about yourself! Hey! If you're good enough, then you can back it up! And Chino Bandido can back it up!   After you read all of the bragging rights on the wall, you walk in to the order area with a deer in front of the headlights look! They already know, they will direct you to their tasting station. Give you samples of their food. After you got a taste of their menu, the planning begins!   I ordered:  Jerk rice, cuban black beans, Jen red pork, and chinese bbq pork. Now you have an option. You can have this Plain! Everything on the plate, or in a burrito, or in a quesadilla! I chose the quesadilla way. Now, i'm not going to lie! I had my thoughts about this! Fusing two kinds of food this way? And better yet, two of the most fattening foods? Before I get into details about their food, I wanted to say that their cuban black beans is the best! And I have had good black beans, heck my father in-law was from Cuba! My Jen Red Pork was in a quesadilla, and that was amazing. Then the mixture of the Jerk Fried rice, black beans, and the Chinese BBQ Pork! I did not expect this, this was one of the best place I have ever had! Boy am I glad I do not live near by! (I would be in a lot of trouble!)   Their dining room is spacious, nothing special, but not needed. I had a great experience here. Not saying that everyone would like it. Remember, we all have a different taste. But looking at their reviews, it looks like they are doing really well.

Another DDD try, we had to come here twice. The first time it was just to crowded. Glad we came back. I really enjoyed the daily special, which changes every day. Also enjoyed the waffles. Wife and daughter enjoyed the usual eggs and hashbrowns. Very friendly service would come again!

We have been here a few times in the past. Never had a problem with Yard House anywhere. Usually when we come here at the mall, usually to visit Tiffany Co. it's during lunch hour on the weekend. I like eating out in the patio area. It's really not outside since it's under the parking structure. But it's still nice.  Service, food, and facility is always decent. Last time there, wife and I shared the chicken club sandwich. When we received it we were kinda surprise that it was a hot sandwich. We expected a cold sandwich. Didn't matter it was really good, don't sure what kind of dressing it was. But it was excellent. It comes with a lot of fries, so there is more then enough to share this dish with somebody. Yard House has a huge selection of spirits and beer. I had the pineapple cider, Always wanted to try a pineapple alcoholic beverage. It was pretty good.   Overall: They came and checked on us plenty of times, Beverages was always topped off. When we need to come by again, pretty sure we'll come by again for a meal.

Finally had a chance to try Famous Dave's. Place just opened, picked any seat I wanted. Served my drink really fast. And took my order. Now for some weird reason, I have been on a ribs fest? When I was younger I loved them, and for some reason I stopped eating ribs for the longest time? But since we moved to the Valley, It's been on! Famous Dave's has three different style ribs. Their famous St Louis ribs, Chicago Style, and Memphis Style. Wasn't sure which one I wanted to try. So I ended up getting a half of slab of the St. Louis and Memphis.  St Louis Ribs were great, I will continue to come back just for these ribs! No wonder why they are their award winning ribs.  Memphis Style ribs were OK, not my cup of tea. I have had better, but this wasn't real bad. Next time I will try their Chicago Style. Ribs come with a selected side dishes. I had their beans and fries. Over all I had a very positive experience, service was very good, and the food were very good.

Had a very interesting day, So the wife and I packed up all four kids and took a little road trip. We were looking for some kind of storage system. So the girls can keep all of their clothes separate. We started in Surprise and worked our-self to Tempe. Wife has never been to IKEA, last time I have visited  IKEA may have been about twenty years ago! And guess what, the store that I visited about twenty years ago, looks just like the one I visited yesterday in Tempe. Nothing has changed!  When we got there, parking lot was packed. We managed to find a spot all the way in the rear of the lot. Which is OK, I need to walk more often! So we wobbled all the way to the store. The first thing you hit is the children's play house. Yes! They have a baby sitter for you!! We decided to take the posse with us, and they were well behaved.  So my wife was in awe! Never seen anything like this before. Glad I was there, you can get overwhelmed with all the people, and products. Ikea has a one-way system. This is to allow you to see all of their products. After spending about three hours looking and writing down what we are interested in. We made a decision to get three wardrobe closets, but since this was a larger item that consist many other parts. We had to go down stairs to the self service area. This is were it can get frustrating! You have to find the correct aisle and bin location for each part and pull it yourself. By the time you get everything you need, get through the cashiers to pay, and then of course they have to have the snack bar right in front of the check out area!  Overall we had a good time, glad I was able to take the wife here. I think she had a great time!

Something I never thought I would do! I support female sports all the time, I have a daughter. But only if it's a good product. I have never been a WNBA supporter. I feel when you need something else to finance your league to keep it a float. Then why have it. The WNBA wouldn't even exists if it wasn't for the NBA's money. Of course the NBA was only thinking that they can gain more fans this way.  With all of this said, I truly hope this league can stand on its own feet in the future. I have been to Lakers games at both The Forum and Staples Center, been to Clippers games at both the L.A. Arena and Staples Center, and attended a Suns game. And I never have been this entertained when I attended a Phoenix Mercury game. They give out a good product, keep the fans involved, and come up with some really great entertainment. Kids and wife had a great time, we'll definitely come back again.

Well,  Since the last review. We have moved to the Phoenix area. And we come here often! Nothing has changed, food is one of the best in the area. There are others that are just as good, but this place impresses us every time we go.

Wasn't sure how to rate this place, but it all came down to the service and food we received.   We had an issue, where we sat. You can see the servers come in and out of the kitchen. We had a perfect shot of what was going inside the kitchen. We had noticed a couple of servers coming out to the dining area chewing on something. As it turned out, they were eating food from the kitchen! I get it, things happen in the kitchen all the time. But don't make it so obvious. At least finish chewing before coming out to serve the food.  Besides that everything else was great. I had the T bone steak, it was great! I also enjoyed the mashed potatoes and gravy that came with it. Wife had the baked lasagna. Think she enjoyed it also. Service was great, and when we will stay at Tuscany in the future. Have no problem eating there again.

Came here a few years ago for a company outing. So you know since I didn't have to pay for this, it's going to be a great review. 1st, even if I did had to pay. This place was awesome. The view, the rooms, the pool, and the service. Really enjoyed my time there. I didn't get a chance to try everything, was busy with work related business. The rooms were outstanding, beds were very comfortable. I slept well and had no problem with noise. Everything was clean, and if I needed anything service was fast.  What I seen of the pool was really nice, they had a couple water slide tubes.   Overall I had a great visit, never encountered any problems.

Really enjoyed this place. We were staying at Tuscany, and decided to try this place out. They give you chips, salsa, and bean dip. Refills will cost you a buck. Wife and I shared a two items combination dinner. Comes with rice and beans. I had a chicken burrito, very good. Comes wet with red sauce. Wife had the beef taco, looked like she enjoyed it. The beans are very good, great taste. Overall we had a great time, service was awesome and very courteous. This place is a must visit.

I have always enjoyed Carl's Jr! This one is not to far from my work, I was actually looking for the Puerto Rican food restaurant in the same strip mall. Since they were closed I went ahead and ate at CJ's!! Just like any of their franchise, food is good, never been a fan of their fries! CJ's is always adding to their menu, so you need to look at it once in awhile. You might miss something you might like!!! I had their Memphis Burger! This beast consist of: hamburger pattie, pull pork, onion rings, and bbq sauce. You have an option to add another pattie if you want, but you don't need to!!! Burger was great, loved the fusion of all the flavors! Service was great, they were training a new worker when they took my order. This location seem to have  a lot more seats! Lots of room!! Area is not that great, but this is a nice location!!

This is diffidently not one of the better Circle K's location! Now that My fathers house has been sold, and no other reason to be in the area. I will probably not come by this place again. I get it, it's not in the greatest area. But when your store looks more ghetto then the area. You have an issue. I have been at this location numerous times, for gas, for drinks, and even to air up the tire once in a great while. Their fuel pumps are just a mess, outside the front door looks like they haven't steam clean the sidewalks since they first opened. Last time I was there, I was moving my dads El Camino, this car was stored in his garage for the last four years. So the tires were a little low. Everywhere I have been to, the establishments has always turn the air on. But not this place, this penny pinching convenience store would not turn it on. The person at the front counter stated they removed the button over a year ago? One dollar for four minutes to air up the tires. Wow   That's all I have to say about this place.

Had a chance to play the palm course, what a nice course. Yes I have played better courses, but you can't take any thing away from this place. Mostly flat and rolling hills. Water only plays in a couple of holes. Bunkers placed at very good locations. Hopefully I will become a regular here.

Best Buy has always been one of my favorite place to go. I usually already know what I want before I arrive. So I never had a issue of needing service. But if I did! Then I would find someone to ask!!! I have always believed that electronics are over priced, so I wish they can lower some of their items a little more! Overall this is a good place to go!!

I like to do reviews when you think they might be under the most duress! When do you think that might be??? Christmas time! Yes, sure there were a few problems, but that will happen all the time! I was looking for a few items, during that time I was asked from four different people if I needed help! One of them I asked if they can look for a game. He had no problem, he told me it should be in a certain area, when I was looking in that area he went to the computer to check if there were something else! He did his job, when I went to pay for the items I had, I asked if they can look up a movie I was looking for! No problem, they looked it up right there for me and I got my answer! This is all I ask for, and they did it! Most people working are just doing there job, it's their job to sell you a warranty, it's their job to sell you extra items, IT's THEIR JOB! People relax! All you have to say is no thanks, then move on!

Walmart is another place I do not like to spend my money, but again! You have to do what you have to do! I really don't understand how you can have Target supporters, and Walmart supporters! I think they are the same, just different colors on the store!! Heck, you can bring me to one store, blind fold me, take me to the other store, and I'll think we still at the first store!!! Same crap, different name! Service is ok, they try! But sometimes it just won't work! This location is pretty big, but there is a lot of people who shops here. You get cheap products at a cheap price, if you want some reliable products? You need to shop somewhere else. So we come here a lot during christmas. We buy a lot of our donated gifts here. Wife loves to give during Christmas! Maybe that's why our church likes her so much??

Just like any chain, people expect the best! But hold on here! This is a chain! You want the best service then go to a fifty to hundred dollar a plate joint. Burgers are very good, one of the best for a restaurant chain. Menu has a very wide selection. Note: If you eat outside in the patio, they tend to forget about you. So you must have patients! Service here is like any other low price chain. It can be up or down. We like it here enough to come back often.

Daughter and I decided to have dinner together, knowing this is one of her favorite place to eat. I figured this would have been her choice! I never really had a favorite dish at red robin, even though I do enjoy trying their variety of hamburgers! But I have been noticing that I have been ordering their fried chicken salad lately! I truly enjoy this plate, now of course it must have honey mustard dressing! Daughter had the same thing but with ranch, and we shared an order of fries with no salt! First time in a long time I really enjoyed having dinner with her, no i-phone!! Pet peeve of mine! If you are going to spend some time with someone! Stay of the F-n phone!!! You can text them later!!! There! Got it off my chest!!! Let's get back to Red Robin, great place to hang out, has a nice bar area, and good service!

Chase bank has always been good to me. Great service, always fully  staffed! When we moved here from California, they were willing do what ever was necessary to make the transfer smooth. They have a drive through ATM, as well they also have a walk up ATM. I am a sold customer of theirs! Our HOA also banks with this same branch. When I became treasurer, they sat me down and explained and helped me about everything. I really like how concerned they are about our accounts.

As of today, I have been trying to get a house waiting for inspection gas on. Now on our fourth try, yes fourth! It still had not been taking care of? Since the house is empty, no one lives there. We have the key in a key box, we instructed them where the key box is at, and the key box code. Pretty simple! Right? BUT NOOOOOOOO!  Their first excuse on 12/31/2013: It was to dark! We are not allowed in a house in the evening.  Second Excuse on 01/06/2014: The key code we gave them is wrong? For your information, I left the key box at 1234. When I checked it the next day. It was still at 1234? Wow, They never even tried!  THIRD EXCUSE ON 01/10/2014: At first they said the key code was wrong again, when I was on the phone with them I was looking at the lock box and it was still at 1234! Again, They never even tried again! I told the customer service rep they are full of it and I am being lied to! I told him that I left the lock box at 1234 at it's still at 1234. He told me to hold, after about fifteen minutes of holding. They came up with a new excuse, we are not allowed to open CBE boxes! (Call before entering). I told them this is just a regular lock box, and  in the past there has never been an issue before!   So now we have a fourth call out for them to come turn on the gas! Just like it has been stated before, SWG expects you to hang around 8-5! Are you kidding me! Who do you think you are!! Cox Cable!!! Now it's just time to wait and see what happens,

Now If you seen my pictures, there's not much hair to cut. But I wasn't the only one!! Now Sports Clip is a man version of a beauty salon for women. And it's pretty cool! Place is loaded with sports memorabilia, and flat screen TVs with ESPN on. You are greeted by some pretty girls. Ladies you have to realize they are trying to bring in the men! And you know how weak we are! Now the young lady who cut my hair was Andrea, and she was very cool. Usually I just keep to my self and let them do the cutting which is only #1 shave all around. Pretty simple and cheap. Andrea was very nice as was the other girls, they try to make you comfortable. But this place does more than that. If you want, you can ask for the MVP and get your hair washed with a scalp massage while sitting in a massage chair. They will also apply an heated towel around your face, and massage your neck and shoulder. Boy they know what our weak spots are! Sports, pretty ladies, and massages! Like I said Andrea was very cool, and nice. I would definitely come back!

Been back here a few times since my last review. Had not changed! Great service, great product. When I do come here, and it's not all the time! I can cut my own hair! I have a great time here. MVP package is the way to go. If your girlfriend or wife doesn't mind you getting your hair cut by a pretty girl! This is a great place to go, it offers a lot more than that!!

I really like this place! Plenty of room, very organized. And is willing to help you out. Price is very acceptable @ $7.00 a day. They have ear plugs, targets and beverages to purchase at a reasonable price. If it's your first time there is a 10 min video they want you to watch. It's diffidently a great place to go, just have to watch out for dumb A$$ like myself. I tend to have a major brain freeze. But the workers there are nice enough to let me know what I did wrong in a polite way. Give me time! I promise I won't shoot anyone! I'll get better.

When you can catch this place open, you need to try it! Food is fantastic, and we would eat here a lot more. But you never know when this place is open for business? Three times yes THREE TIMES!!! We have came here during business hours, and the doors are locked? Last time it was Saturday @ 5:30pm, yes on a saturday. This is when they are suppose to be open? Have no idea why they were closed again! If this place would be open when they say they would, place would have more stars!

To let you know! This place is a hit and miss place!! Food is great, But you need to get there when they are open! When we are able to find this place open, we just love the food. And since I raised their rating to 4, that is only because they were opened again!! I have had their meatloaf sandwich, cheese burger, vegi sandwich, chicken, and pork Schnitzel. I have yet to have a bad plate. I always tried to get something different every time I come here. But I may only order their Pork Schnitzel for now on. One of my favorite dishes.

With the recent death of my grandmother, and father! It really made me starting to think about having a will. So I went ahead and had one wrote up, I just needed to get it notorized, and I was surprised that the UPS Store takes care of that!! I had a couple of witnesses with me to sign, they knew exactly what I had to do. The only reason why I did not give them 5-star review. I was there the day before, no more then a couple of minutes past closing time. I run a branch for my company, one thing I learned is never turn away customers!

When I went to school back in the 80's. This was my source of meals! Had a very tight budget, hardly had any money. But on my way home I would stop off here and buy two whoppers for 99 cents! That's right only 99 cents. I probably ate there 5 days a week. So I'm just rating this place for keeping me full!

Still searching for that best pizza in the valley! Since our favorite was at Bronco Billies, and they recently closed down! Since Rosati's was across the street, we had to give them a try! We ordered a thin crust, pepperoni, green peppers, cooked well done. I was surprise with the burst of flavor. I do wish they would have cooked the pizza even longer! Crust were not crispy enough. We also tried their garlic bread, and jalapeno popper! Again, they should have been cooked just a little bit longer. Over all we were very happy with their food! We will come back again!!

Wanted to find a burger shop out here that reminded us back home, like a Fabulous or Douglas Burgers. So far this is the closest thing. Wife and Daughter loved their burgers especially their country burger. Daughter and I loved their chili cheese fries. I have had their Italian beef sandwich and their burgers! We have no complaints about them. This is not a restaurant!! So you are not going to have great service! We will be coming back often.

Into the twilight zone once again!!  I have written a review in the past, but noticed it was nowhere to be found! So after finding it on one of my list, there are two Benny's links? Guess this place in under new management, so yelp allowed them to start over. Like I have said on the other reviews, never had a problem with this place. Wife loves their country burger, reminds her of the Douglas Burgers in SoCal. I have always tried different items on their menu never being disappointed. I have had their burgers, Italian beef,  pull pork, and much more. Great place, will be back again, but not during lunch hour on the weekdays. Very busy!

Sadly I had to use their service recently, Was involved in an accident and my insurance recommended this establishment. From coming to tow my truck, keeping me updated, to allowing me to drop off my rental at their location. Everything was very smooth, very nice customer service. The only issue I had was when my truck was repaired, I noticed the steering slightly sticking. Automotive agreed and called my insurance about it. However, my insurance had their own opinion.  The only reason why I could not give them a five-star review was, they should have noticed the steering sticking when the truck was at their facility. But other wise, it was a easy and great experience.

I attended the Nationwide series last year and had a good time. First of all, the drive to and from is a nightmare! Not much thought there? And this is for only Saturday! I wonder how bad it is for the Sprint series on Sunday? But once you're their, it's a great time. I really like this semi-short track. Even thought they are changing the track as we speak now! Wonder how it's going to be now? Seating is pretty good all the way around! Sure glad they don't race during the summer months! If you are a NASCAR fan, you need to come by and experience this place!

Brought our two girls, one of them who is six years old wanted to donate 10" of her hair to Locks of love.  We only had to wait for a few minutes, and since it was slow. They brought them both in very quickly. Our 6 year old wanted a drastic cut, they cut over ten inches off. She was nervous at first, but they made it fun for her. By the time they were finished, her hair looked great!  Our 8 year old wasn't so brave! But she did have about 3 to 4 inches trimmed. It was funny to watch these kids get their hair washed and scalped massage, they were totaled zoned out!  Both of their hair cuts were great, we had a good time, and we will probably come back here for their hair cuts in the future.

This was our first meal together when we moved here little bit over a year ago. Yes! We ordered pizza! I have always liked Pizza Hut, but this was a bad experience! Pizza was just plain, not much flavor? And we had to pay for it that evening to the next day!!! Wife refuses to order from there again. And I have no problem with that.

I really don't know how my son and I ended up at this location? There is one closer to where I live!! Anyway, son was down visiting from the dreaded S.F.!!! Now when we both lived in SoCal, we use to visit a Sonics in Anaheim after hockey practice. So we have always enjoyed Sonic's. We both ordered breakfast, I had their breakfast burrito with bacon. I thought it was good, not to much salt which is good to me! Son had the texas toast breakfast sandwich! Even though we both like the bread, it is a little to large trying to wrap your mouth around it! They were very nice, and got our food out very quickly.

On my way to Kingman, I dropped by to get a breakfast burrito. Now when the wife and I go to Cali early in the morning, Our ritual is to pick up a breakfast burrito on the way out. I usually order the steak and egg burrito while my wife always order their country burrito. Their country burrito consist of potato's, eggs, and cheese. Well I decided to order the country burrito with a twist. I asked them to add chili verde. They were more then happy to do that for me. Filiberto's is conveniently located in the same building with the Shell mini-mart. So you can go next door and get what you need and come back for your food.  Everything was easy and convient, got in and got out very quickly. And the Burrito? It was great!!

Never been to a more disgusting and dirty store in my life? Guess they do not know how to shampoo their carpet? You see carpet stains every where at this place. Clothes just thrown back on the racks, just a cheap place. Noticed everything here is made in China, so don't expect anything from here to last!

Tutor Time has been very helpful, we have five foster kids from ages 2 - 8 yrs old. My wife is able to drop off the 2,4, and 5 yrs old on the way to work. The 7 and 8 yr old is picked up at their school by Tutor Time after classes. Then on my way back home from work, I am able to pick all 5 of them up. Very convenient and very easy to work with. However the only issue I have, some people actually a lot of people also work on the weekends. Tutor Time is only open on school days. So that means, they are closed on weekends, holidays, and any other days the school district is off. That can be an issue, kids are off, we are at work, and the people you are depending on are closed!

Well,  All we have heard is nothing but good things about this place. The only reason we tried it because Garcia's is much further away! Looking at their menu it really looked like they specialize in spinach, and looks like they have some other food that other restaurants do not offer. I just had a simple carnitas? Not to hard to screw it up, but they did. Seem like they over did the marinating! The beans were good, their spanish rice tasted like rice pilaf? Place just doesn't do it for us.

All of these years, I have always wanted to learn CPR. Now that my wife and I are earning our Foster Parents license. This is one of the requirements! This is a four hour class, yes four hours!!! I for one I was happy it was this long, There is no way you can learn safety in just an hour or so. Our class was CPR, First Aide, and AED for adults and infants. My worst fear has always been if someone close to be is in need for help and I couldn't help. Now I have a lot more confident in knowing I can at least try, and make a differences.  Everything was hands on and video training. I will definitely come back when I need more training!

Wife and I decided to go on a little run last night. We stopped off at Western Trails. Nothing going on Sunday nights. But their restaurant was open. Only a few locals were there eating, but it was nice. Waitress told us we can set anywhere! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries, and coleslaw. (always have it with coleslaw, so you can put the slaw on the sandwich! Only way to eat it!!) Wifey had their TNT BLT? Extra crispy appplewood bacon, with pepper jack cheese, and chipotle mayo on a croissant! They were very good!! We are going to come back during there busy days to check everything out. But their food is well worth the trip.

This is a local General Store that takes care of the locals! Drive by this place all the time, wished I have stopped by a long time ago! What an awesome place! They just don't make these anymore!! It's been years since I have seen a store like this, has a lot of equipment for the local farmers and horse owners! Has a sandwich deli, offers pizza, chili dogs, hot sandwiches, AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OF ALL!!!!!! THRIFTY ICE CREAM!!!!!!!!!! Yes!!!! Here we are my wife and I have been arguing about were to go for ice cream! We both grew up with Thrifty Ice Cream, Now this place doesn't sale their ice cream at a cheap price. "Remember the old 35 cent scoop at Thrifty Drug Store! But now we have a place to go, when we are in a mood for ice cream!!! If anyone is near by, you just gotta pay a visit. I really think its a really cool store.

Very nice to see Las Vegas adding a place like this! You can watch a musical in full length! We had the opportunity to watch Les Miserables on opening night! Unless you are season ticket holder, or you purchase your tickets from a ticket broker? You will most likely have seats in the balcony! Listen, it's not that bad! We had a great time, The Smith Center is gorgeous, great access to parking or valet. Yes, you do have those snobish idiots! Yes those people who has lots of money and thinks they own everything! And you have a lot of those in Vegas! I actually go into with one when he was angry that The Smith Center does not offer Capt. Morgan Rum!! I told him to get a life!! Any way we had a great time, great show, and will plan to come back! You should see their 2013-2014 schedule! It's loaded!

I have no problem with this place, very convenient when you want to eat, watch a movie. Even if you're at a Coyotes or Cardinal game, you can get a bite or drink before or after the game. Has a nice selection of shop to browse through! Quick tip, there are other restaurants across the streets or further up on their parking lot. They can use more shops, but this can really be a nice place.

Was just driving by when I decided to try this place. I ordered their pastrami dip with spicy mustard and a soda. I am not much of a pastrami person but a pastrami dip just sounded good. It was! So when I have more time, family and I will come back and give this place a better try!! But so far it was great.

I never thought I would ever eat at Golden Corral for a very good reason. I just don't like buffets. Just the idea of bulk food being pushed out ASAP. It has been years since I have been to one. But today was my lucky day, Our aunt wanted to take us out for dinner after I was nice enough to help her at her apartment. Now this place has a lot of food! And a lot of people! I had their steak, medium but it was more like medium well and tasted like leather. Wanted a bun, but this one lady decided to take all twelve buns at once and left none! Asked her if she had enough, I can easily get another plate for her and take it to her table! She just looked at me? How rude! Anyway, I had some other food. They did look good, but just didn't taste that well. This place was a mess, tables were dirty, crumbs everywhere. But what do you expect! Only came here because of my aunt, this is not a franchise I normally go to. Only because I am not a buffet person.

Just in the mood for a new place to have breakfast, hit my yelp button. This place pops up. I had the steak strip breakfast. comes with two eggs, sirloin steak strips, hash browns, choice of pancakes, biscuit and gravy, or toast. this was one of my favorite plate I have ever had! Steak was very good, had a great taste seasoned very well. hash browns were cooked exactly the way I like them, crispy! The pancakes are the only reason I did not give a five star review, they are good, but I have had better and I prefer the thin pancakes over the thick ones. But I will definitely come back again

OK,  This is really weird! I am writing this review for the second time? What ever happen to the first one!!!!  Any way! We have been here a few times. We really like the people here and the food is really good! Now the times we have been here, it has been later in the evening and is pretty much empty. But there service was still off? Maybe they were in closing mode!! Place has a mountain, log cabin type of decor! Reminds me of my mothers home in the mountains! Food is really good, we have had the usual cheese burger, chicken fried steak, and breakfast! Never had anything bad here yet, but we will continue to find something? As a family we like coming here, only wish we had one closer to our area!

What a way to cap off the night! After a couple of cousins and I caught a game at Salt River. We had to pick up wifie and the girls at our daughters house. So all nine of us went searching for a place for dinner. Our first choice, who I am not going to disclosed. Is closed on Sundays, and it wasn't Chick fil A! So we ended up coming here. Now when we first walked in, we where told to sit any where we wanted. I had some doubts at first, the music they had on was some kind of meditation type. And the first item I seen on the menu was the Tree huggin Veg head! I was like, NO! Lets go! But my professional beer drink-en cousin seen the list of beers, so we decided to stay! And I was glad that we did! Food: I had their Ro Diddy Steak Sandwich, it is basically a steak sandwich with red peppers and cheese. I really enjoyed it. Meals comes with a choice of sides, I had their fries. Their fries are actually cross cut fries, just like the ones at Arby's. Meal was very good.  The rest of the crew had many different items, seems like everyone enjoyed dinner. Service:  As soon we walked in, they were on top of us right away. We sat, they took our drink order, and we got our food very quickly. Our waitress did seem to forget about us at the end. But no big deal, place really got busy during the evening. But throughout our meal, she took very good care of us.  Yes I judged this place by their cover, and glad I was proven wrong. Since we live in the west valley, our visits will be limited. But I will make it a point, when we visit the area to come here.

My mom's car had an issue with the battery or alternator! Brought the car in for testing. Service department said it was a bad battery, quoted me an outrageous price. I figured since they already had it in their stall, go ahead and do it. Brought my mom over to pick it up, when she started the vehicle. The warning light came back on!!! I am not going to allow her to drive this back to California with this risk!!! So I brought the Service manager, and the mechanic who worked on it to the car. i showed them the issue, he wanted me to look at the test paper! Really! You was just going to let my 63 yr old mother to leave your yard with a defect!!!! So I went ahead and took the car to O'Reillys, they will test your alternator for FREE!!!! Test showed it was a bad alternator. I went ahead and bought one, took it to my house and replaced it. Wow, the warning light no longer comes on. I took the car back to Firestone, asked for the battery back, umm! We no longer have the battery! Really!!! The only reason why I did not rate them at one star, because the manager tried to make amends for this. He went ahead and credit me the electrical test! I felt better that my mom had a new alternator and battery! NOTE: Battery job cost more then the Alternator job!!! Don't know if I will give this place another try????

After years of going to the Orange County Fair and Los Angeles County Fair for years. I thought there weren't going to be any fair much better. This year was our first visit at the Arizona Sate Fair! And it was very enjoyable. My Mother in law and Sister in law were both in town from Cali to visit. So we all decided to stop by here. Now of course I had to eat the scorpion, and ended up eating a wagon wheel, BBQ beef sandwich, chili cheese curly fries(w/daughter!!), Navajo taco(w/wife),took a bite of corn dog from my daughters hand! There were some killer rides out there. (I have been at Magic Mountain tons of times, and none of their rides intimidated me at all. When it comes down to it, we had a great time! I expected exactly this! This is not going to be Disneyland, Knotts Berry Farm, or Six Flags Magic Mountain. This is a State Fair!

This might be funny to some of you, but I never seen a Sun Devil game here. I was lucky to catch a few of the old USFL Arizona Wranglers or Arizona Outlaws games. It was a lot of fun, and I can only imagine how great it would be in a college atmosphere!!

Wife and I actually had a good time here. Been here twice now, service is very good. In two visits, we have had their BLT, cheeseburger, sports fries w/chili, chips and salsa, prime rib sliders. All of it were very good! Daughter had their meatball sandwich, even though she wasn't that impressed. I liked it very much!!! Music was great, and we will come back again!

There is a few reasons why we wanted to eat here! 1st- We seen this on Triple D! 2nd- They offer baked spaghetti, even though it's not on their menu! 3rd- I was told their pizza is one of the best? There's not much more I can add that everyone else has already said. Parking is very convenient in the back. We had a waitress that was awesome! Dumb ME! I never asked for her name. But she was very nice and made us feel welcome! When we visited Texas a few years ago, my wife discovered baked spaghetti! Ever since then I have been on a mission to find another restaurant that offers it. Watching triple D, is how I found out La Piazza offers it!!! So we ordered their baked spaghetti, filetti pizza, coca cola light? and to end the night with their homemade cheesecake with caramel and chocolate! Wife enjoyed the baked spaghetti, it wasn't the best. But she would order it again. She think the baked spaghetti at Cheddar's is the best!! Their pizza was really good, I am a pizza sauce type of guy! But I have been really enjoying the authentic type of pizza. Their cheesecake was very good to cap off the night. Overall we had a great time and will come back again!!

Co worker recommended me to try this place, so I forgot my lunch at home (oops!!) and came here during my lunch hour. Came in and the owner was at the front desk. Told me I can sit anywhere I wanted to! Place was very clean, in one room it was like a little sports bar! Had TVs and a bar. In the main room was more like a little dining room. Place is not that big, but still nice. Decorated with football memorabilia, especially from New Orleans. Had a sizable menu, I order the Ranger! It was a pulled pork sandwich w/coleslaw an a white or wheat bun. It also came with one side order! Sandwich was very good, I have never had creole BBQ! First time and I would have it again. People there were very nice, Now I am not a professional food taster! (but I play one at home!) And if you look at my pictures I have tried!! Everyone is going to have their own opinion, and you have to realize everyone has a different taste! I liked this place!

We were in town and wanted to try some of the DDD recommended locations. We only came here because Matt's was so small and crowded. Glad we came by, It's not the best place in town. But we really enjoyed the wolfpack, service was very friendly. We had a good time.

It's been about a year since we have been here, boy has it and it's going to change! Service was much better, a lot more customers, and they are going to move at a new location. No more outside in the patio. Everything is going to be inside now! Hopefully this move is going to make this place even better?

Came back for a second time. I always give even the worse ratings a second chance! Daughter was spending some time with me and we ended up here since she has never tried it. She ordered their cheese enchilada, and ground beef taco combination. I had their "The Fireman" it's like a steak picado but more spice and heat. I loved this plate, daughter loved her plate also. The rice and beans were still great from the last trip here. Their chips seem to be different and better. We ended up coming back the next night to bring my wife for her second time. She also was surprised about how much better it was. So we now have a second best place to go! Garcia's on 35th Ave is our favorite, but now at our West Valley location. Rio Mirage Cafe has now replaced La Fuentes has our favorite West Valley Mexican Restaurant! Cheers to you Rio Mirage for making changes to get better!!!

This is going to be one of the hardest reviews I will ever do! Rio Mirage have been our family favorite since we moved to Surprise three years ago. Yes, it started off with a bump in the road. But this local gem have seen us three to four times a month on a regular bases! Every time we have family visiting, we would bring them to Rio Mirage! This is how much we have loved this place! Sadly, we had a recent issue. And if any of you yelpers out there think I am in the wrong? Please do not hesitate and message me!  On Jan. 31st, wife and myself was having dinner at Rio Mirage. We noticed a posted sign advertising a Superbowl platter @ $29.95 each. My wife knowing her work was going to have a company party on Feb. 10th. She decided to order five platters, large rice, large beans,  salsa, and chips. Totaling over $400.00, we asked since she was paying for the order that day. Can we get the Superbowl special price? We were told no! Rio Mirage said the platters special were for the Superbowl only. Since the company party was a week after the Superbowl, we had to pay regular price. Even though she paid before the Superbowl?My wife went ahead and placed the order, and still pre-paid the order. Now this is were we are upset about! I have called Rachel Gomez who owns Rio Mirage, and is their corporate contact twice and left a voice mail, I have left two messages on their website, I have sent Rachel an e-mail. All of this since Feb. 1st. As of today! Feb. 12th, we still have not received any replies from Rio Mirage!! This really saddens me, the crew they have working their is great! Always nice, fast, and really try to service you! We have gotten to know JC! The best waiter around, he also tends the bar! But now we have a very bad taste from the management and owners. Regular price on the platters are $40.00 each. Not making a big deal about the $10.00 difference per platter. But a $50.00 difference is not going to make or break this restaurant, Our biggest issue is no one every got back to us about this? At the bottom of their "About Us" page on their website states:  "Alex and I will always strive to deliver the best food, service, and truly desire to make your every visit a memorable one."  Rachel! With you ignoring our phone calls, messages, and e-mails. This is one statement you truly do not believe in!

I have been going back to Rio Mirage once again, management got  a hold of me. We were able to discuss the situation. Again, I was never asking for anything! Food and service were never an issue. We discussed the problem, management gave me an reason, and everything is fine. Rachel admitted there is a problem with their website and getting her messages off the website is not the easiest way. The only reason why she knew there was an problem, was reading my review on yelp! Once she knew there was an issue, she messaged me right away! I could accept that, and will move on! Rio Mirage can expect me there once a week again! Glad to be back!

Well,  We knew what we were getting our self into when we decided to try this joint! And we were right, Besides the good looking girls, this place is not that great! Burger was OK, I made it better with the condiments, fries were OK, I did though liked their shakes! Glad we tried it, probably will not come back! But seriously, you get what they advertise!!

Wow! Never knew this place even existed. Stopped by here only to try their burger! Yes a burger at a Frenchie restaurant! Probably one of my favorite burger of all-time!!! The Cabernet Burger!!! This puppy has a 1/2lb beef patty flavored with Cabernet wine, Swiss cheese, bacon jam, caramelized onions, served with French fries. I'm at that age when I am trying different thing in food. And am I glad I tried this. Since I am only a few blocks away from here, this is where I will be getting my burger from. Not sure if the family will like this place. Wife and daughter are pretty much safe on food. I will like to come back and try other things here soon.

This is a nice theater, only came here for a special engagement showing of the 25 anniversary of the Phantom of the Opera. Had a very good time, seats are very comfy, had enough leg room. Popcorn was very good, prices are a little steep, but almost all theaters are. I will return only when I need to. I still love our local place in Surprise.

Never actually ate at the location. We have had take out on a couple of occasions. Really good food, have had their orange chicken, chow mein, Mongolian beef. Seems to be the best locally. I could only think of a couple of places that are better, but they are California!! This will be our Chinese food joint, until they fail us!!! Service has always been good, and price are decent!

just happen to drive by and noticed this pizza joint hidden on Reems! So since i have been trying to try out every pizza joint out in the west valley! I stopped by and had a slice. i usually have my pizza well done, since I like the crust and doe to be crunch! But since I was in a rush and didn't ask for it. Pizza was still great, sauce, cheese, and peperoni had a lot of flavors! Everyone was very friendly, seemed like all the customers were having a good time. I will diffidently come back with the wife and try it again!!

Finally was able to eat here. After a year of putting it off or just plane out forgetting about this restaurant. We finally decided to try it out!! One thing I noticed about the Phoenix area is there are a lot of great food out here. Living is SoCal most of my life, it seemed we just ate at the same place all the time. But here we try a new place almost once or twice a month. No Babbo is a restaurant located at Reems and Bell plaza. You have to look for it, kind of tuck away in the back. It's not that big, but there are plenty of tables. Now I had their Chicken Chipotle Pasta it has Roasted Chicken, Corn, Scallions, Mixed Peppers, Chipotle Cream, Lime Juice, and Cilantro. Served on Penne. I thought it was something different and I am glad i ordered it. Very good, especially I enjoyed the extra kick in it. Wife had their pepperoni pizza, it had good taste, but we should have had them cook it a little longer. We like that crispy crust! Daughter had there spaghetti and meatball. She actually loved it, I had a taste of their meatball and it was very good. Overall we had a great time, and yes if we had company from Cali over. We wouldn't have a problem taking them here.

Really don't know why it took us almost four years to come back here? The food here is great! On this visit, I had the cajun jambalaya. This dish comes with chicken, sausage, onion, and peppers. It's a spicy dish but well worth it. Mama, had the pepperoni pizza. We asked for it to be crispy, I guess we need to have them burn it? Still the pizza was really good, and another dish that was spicy. Sounds like this should be a five star review, right? Well, The hostess needs to dress better. If I wanted to see a tank top over a tube top. I would have gone to the beach. Other workers at least are running around in black t-shirts.  FLIES, there were flies inside the restaurant. One just bugged the hell out of us. Finally at the end of our meal, I was able to smashed it. YES PETA, I killed it! Hopefully our next visit will be sooner then four years.

This is a tough review,  When I usually do a review, it's a experience not only by me but also the family.  I was just OK with Logan's.  Service: The service was fine, the atmosphere was good. We actually had a very good time there, but please note! Next time we go there, we will be seating in the dining room. The bar is very uncomfortable. AND PLEASE WATCH YOUR STEP, wife almost fell! FOOD:  I ordered the half rack of baby back ribs w/fries. The ribs were cold, and maybe that took away any chance of a good experience? Ribs were tough, and just wasn't doing anything for me. Very disapointed about that, I was really in the mood for ribs. Fries were good, and their dinner rolls were great! Now for the rest of the family who had a great time. Daughter #1 had he usual chicken tenders and fries, Daughter #2 had Mac and Cheese, and the wife had a bake potato and salad. They all enjoyed their dinner, I had a piece of Daughter #1's chicken and it was very good, loved the texture and spices.  Like I said before, we'll comeback again

Finally found a decent BBQ restaurant! Since I have moved here, it has been really hard to find a place I would like to come back over and over again. Dillon's the place, so what if there are older people here! This place is in Sun City Grand, what do you expect!! So what if it's loud! The family and I tried this place and I am already to go back and try something else. Of course we started with their onions rings, and yes they are as good as advertised. Momma had the pulled pork sandwich which was great. Daughter had the hamburger, and that was really good. And I had the brisket with mash potatoes! As you could tell I tried everything! Very happy this place is close to our home, and no we do not live in Sun City!

I recently set up my wife and daughter for a hour massage on Mothers Day. It was really easy, they asked all the questions regarding gender and who they prefer! They were charged the first time of $39.00 each, and with the great experience they both had. It's a good chance they might become members.

Being from Cali, and had the oppertunity to watch movies at the premier sites. Of course this place does'nt match up to them! But for being a local theater, that offers Tues. and Thurs. specials! I have no problem with this place. I usally come here during the week days late to watch a movie with the family to stay away from the kids who would rather talk then watch a movie. The D box is ok to try once, but I will not be using again.

Once again, family was out to try something new! I was in the mood for pizza. I noticed there were quite a few pizza joint in this area! So this was the first one we tried. We order a pepperoni and green peppers pizza well done, spaghetti and meatballs, and chicken Parmesan. The pizza was good, I enjoyed the flavors, pepperoni, cheese, and sauce was very good. I am not sold on the crust! But overall the pizza was still good. The spaghetti was very good, especially the meatballs! It takes a lot for me to like meatballs and these were one of the best I have tasted. Daughter hardly gave me a chance to taste the chicken Parisian, but what I did taste was really good, they do like to pile on the cheese, that's the way to get my daughters heart! Over all we had a great time, we love the small mom and pops atmosphere, and we will probably come back soon!

For the experience, it is definitely a solid five stars. You get to have a top notch lunch or dinner, then you watch a broadway musical right from your table. I have been to a few musicals in my time. And ABT knows how to put on a show. I took my wife to watch The King and I. We had the lunch and show package. We walked in around 12:30, and was greeted by a hostess. She took us to our table and explained every thing to us on what to expect.  The menu their changes with the shows. Wife had the orange chicken with rice. I had the peppered crusted steak with vegetables. Food was out of sight!  Overall we had an outstanding day, and will be planning to return many times. Why I didn't give it a five star rating you asked. Even though the talent is great, it's not on the level of a major broadway theater. But you should still come and have this experience.

Like I said, we were going to come back. I love this place, and hoped the one bad experience was and is going to be the only time. We came back last Sunday, had an awesome experience. Took our orders, brought them back exactly they way we wanted. Service was top notch! And of course the show was amazing! So I raised the review to five stars where it should be. Great place to take my wife, and enjoy the day or evening at. Might become a subscriber here. Get a chance to see about four or five shows a year.

Wanted to stop by based on the television show Outrageous Food! I had the Crazy Cowboy! Based on what I thought was going to be a different kind of breakfast. I am really happy I had it! The Crazy Cowboy is a chicken fried steak, smothered with beans, scrambled eggs, topped off with there chili verde! I was very happy with this meal! Their Chili Verde is one of the best I have had in a while. Daughter wanted to try a apple pancake, very different, not bad. I am just a plain type of pancake person. Wife had their eggs, bacon, and potato breakfast. Their potato's are very different! Has a mixture of red, white, purple potato's with the sweet potato's. Not bad! Over all we had a very good breakfast, if we are ever in the area again, we will come back again!!! One thing! Dude! If you're going to have a night of passion with your lady or guy!! Cover up your neck! Wear a turtle neck or something! Or maybe call in sick! Not something a lot of people want to see!!!

Wife an I decided to have a slice of pepperoni pizza. Glad it was only a slice! Their slices are about the same as a small pizza. So we never been here before, and wanted to try it out. We are really glad we did. Pizza has a very crispy crust, sauce has a little bite to it, and since their pizza is on the well done side. Their pepperoni is perfect. The only problem here, they do not check on you to see if you need anything! But we will be back!

Let me make this clear to everyone!!! People at fast foods are there for a reason! Most of them are going to school, or just there for the summer! i am not talking bad about them! Most of them, this is their first jobs!! So the service at most fast food joints are not going to be great. With that said, this location does have some issues. But that is expected. Popeyes Chicken is my favorite fast food chicken only behind Pioneer's!!! I love their spicy chicken, mashed potato's and gravy, and red beans w/rice. I like that their menu has a lot of different items! This location is the closest to my home. So when I am in the area, watch out! I'll be there!

1st! Place is not closed. There was an issue with legal workers in the franchise chain. Now they are back! Food is one of the best! Especially their chicken mango! Daughter is a huge PF Chang fan, so she loves this place also! Her favorite is their Mongolian beef, and noodles! They are always coming up with something new, so you may have to try them more then a few times.

OK, Don't know whats going on? But this is the second review I know was already done before! It must be in the black hole!!!! Any way, I love this place! We usually eat here after a Coyotes game (Go Coyotes) It's a fun place, great food, almost any kind of beer you want! Whats wrong with that? (nothing) This place can get busy, and does have a lot of seating, but during game day! Expect some delays. But well worth the wait.

Had to ship out a package, like any other post office. It's a hit and miss with traffic in the parking lot, and lines to be served. Luckily, only had a few cars in the parking lot. Not that many people inside. Customer service was very helpful, and got me out very quickly.

Food is very good, service is also good. Problem is that my favorite food is not very healthy! And OG's food is very fattening! But that's my problem! For a restaurant chain this place is one of the best.

Its McDonald's! What do you expect? Workers that believe they deserve $15.00 per hour. But will get your order wrong most of the times.  When you decide to eat at McDonald's, you know what you're getting. Nothing special, not healthy, but it's not intended to be. Service here is not to bad. We only come here for their ice cream. Kids love it. Had to ask for napkins, other than that it was OK.

Trader Joe's is a very nice store. If you're looking for organic, healthy, or just the out of the ordinary items? Trader Joe's just might have it. It does get busy here, and tend to have long lines. I have to get into a phase when I start coming here again. But it's always there for us!!

Took my girls out for Valentine's on Saturday night! Jeanne Robertson was in town, always wanted to see her but was never out west until now. This center is not that big, but that is fine with me! You don't have to deal with the outrageous crowd, and everything else that comes with it! I can truly say that there is not a bad seat in the place!! Seats are comfortable, and they don't try to squeeze you in a sardine can! And of course the show made it that much better! If they are having any other show I want to see, I will be there again!!

On our way to Canyon Lake we noticed the Goldfield Ghost Town! So I mentioned to the wifey, we'll stop by on our way home! It was around 2:30 when we ended up stopping by. Wife was hungry, so men! You know what does that mean!! We have to be hungry also. When you walk into Mammoth Steakhouse, the first thing you noticed are the boots hanging up on the ceiling, and animals on the wall. They have a very nice bar, and even in the heat. They have enough fans on to keep the place decent. Now the service was probably the worst thing here. We were walking around for a few minutes until someone finally noticed us! Place was not busy? We sat at the stage area were they had some entertainment! I had their BBQ beef sandwich w/ fries. Wife had the mammoth burger w/fries. We also had their potato skins as a appetizer, now we did bring home a lot of food! Their potato skins were great! Lots of flavor, it had your usual cheese, green onion, bacon, and sour cream. This was probably one of the best potato skins we ever had! Getting to my BBQ beef sandwich, this was alright. It was just your basic shredded beef, and sauce. It was just plain, nothing special! If they have added peppers and cheese WOW!! But that didn't happen. Now to their mammoth burger, wife had this with no mushrooms, burger is a good size, and man did it smell good. Wife was grubbing down on this thing, saying this is one of the best burger she has ever had! I finally got a bite from it, and she was right. Lots of flavor from the pepper jack cheese, grilled onions! This is the reason why we will come back. Now back to the down side of things, first our diet coke seemed to be stale, and our server was Swayze. Now I'm not going to grill her about how bad our service was, just pay a little more attention to your customers. Overall she is a real cute and nice girl, (don't let my wife know I said that!) We had a great time, the entertainment was great, food was great!

I'm not a huge fan of OG! Just your typical franchise restaurant. But the wife, daughter, and myself had a great experience at this location. Food was very good, I had the stuffed chicken Marsala. Seen it on TV, and wanted to try it. Glad I did! Chicken was very moist, stuffed with dried tomato's,  Wife enjoyed their ravioli's with meat sauce, daughter had no problem with the Alfredo! Our server was Wolfgang, really nice guy! Always came by and checked on us, always made sure everything was fine. Place has a very good server there! This OG location, is probably the best experience we have had with Olive Garden.

My son was visiting us from San Fran. for Thanksgiving. So we decided to stop here on Thanksgiving night, since I don't have NFL network, and he wanted to watch the 49ers. We had a great time, just had a few drinks. Probably will eat there at a later day. Seating were very comfortable, service was very good. I have no problems here, going to come back!

After living here in the west valley for the last three years, I finally was able to attend a game at Camelback Ranch! Since I am from the Los Angeles area, of course I am a die heart Dodger fan. I was very happy to attend a game when my cousin came down to visit. Stadium is very nice, this in my third stadium to visit here in the cactus league and is one of the better one's. Since I live in Surprise, I am a little biased with Surprise Stadium. But I think Camelback Ranch is a letter better! Seats are very comfortable, very close to the game, and the most important thing is the beer is just up the steps. Only issue I had was during the game, and trying to watch it, the vendors are very loud trying to sell their products. Not the ones walking down the isles, I'm talking about the ones stationed on the walkways!! But overall this is a great experience, and it's never a bad day to watch the Dodgers!!

Had the opportunity to watch a game here with my cousin. Very nice park, plenty of space, seating is very comfortable, and plenty in the shade. Just like most spring training parks, you are very close to the game. The volunteer staff was very courteous and helpful. Prices are just like any other parks, a complete rip off. But oh well!! Selection of food was very good, they offer coors light for the Bud Light lovers. But it works! Every year my cousin and I goes to different parks to enjoy the spring training. This park will be revisited.

I actually found a place I like in Surprise! So now this might limit my trips to Garcia's on 35th Ave. Service was excellent, food was great. Next time we will try their buffet. Can't add to what has already been said. We are going to make this our weekly stop during our movie night!

What can I say! The changes! McDonalds has been around forever! And now they want to change! Just because a few people wants to run our lives!! I get it! You can always make it an option! But no! You have to request fries! or soda! If I want a freakin apple or milk, I'll just eat at home! We come to the golden arches to get away from everyday life. Give me that processed food! That's why we come here for!!! Anyway, this location is like any other place. Good service, at least they try! You have to realize that if these workers were more valuable, they would be working somewhere else! Give these kids a break. We have all been there!

After driving by this place for almost a year. Daughter and I decided to try this place for breakfast after our Sunday morning hike! Daughter had her favorite! The Country skillet with no gravy, she enjoyed it very much, She's not much on home fries, she loves hash browns. But since they did not offer that. She actually enjoyed the home fries! Sausages were different but very good. I had their pancakes, I could only eat two out of the three. They were very thick, and very good. Glad we finally tried it, and we will definitely come back!

Well, we just had our worst experience this past weekend! Has nothing to do with the food! Food is really good, their service was really bad. Wife, daughter, her friend, and myself had lunch there this past Saturday! Even though their food was good, Again! our waitress was really bad, Wife order their cheeseburger well done! I had to send it back because it was really pink. Daughter wanted extra bbq sauce and ranch dressing! Never got the ranch dressing. I had to keep on top of her for refills! This is not going to stop us from coming back, but now we will consider other options now.

Been here a total of six times in the last six months. Just had two procedures done on my legs. Everyone are very nice, place is always clean. Dr. Romi did the procedures and I had a good experience. I choose not to be put under, he did everything when I was awake. He did the best as possible to be pain free. During the procedures he explained every thing to me while doing the work.  Only reason I only gave them a 4 - star review, because their billing department doesn't have it all together.  Hopefully this will be my last visit, but if needed. I'll come here again.

After fours years of living here, and kept on talking about eating here. I finally had my chance!  1st mistake, do not take your wife who hates seafood, and can not stand the smell of fish here on Fridays! It's all you can eat fish fry! After getting over the smell, she was fine. Now I wasn't sure if this was a restaurant that serves beer? Or a bar that serves food. This place looks a lot larger from the outside, however it can still sit a lot of customers by using their outdoor patio. Now the food! I order the bangers and mash, I was very satisfied with this dish. Really enjoyed the sausage. Very good taste, loved the texture and seasoning.  Our girls both had chick tenders, both liked their dishes very much. I actually tasted the tenders and I also agreed with them. Again, very good seasoning. Wife had a cheeseburger, and after taking a bite out of it. I knew she liked it, because of the grill taste of it! She loves her charbroiled flavor. I also had to get some hot wings. The girls like to have them every time we go out. They were good, and very tasty. Service was great, even though they were very busy for the Friday fish fry. They were able to take care of everyone without any problems. This is definitely a place to come back to, and we will.

Great dogs, great drinks, great people!  We have stopped by and grabbed something to eat many times. We have also hired them to cater a company picnic. Have always been very accommodating. They have a selection of: Jumbo Dogs, Mini Dogs, Spicy Dogs, Polish Sausages and Brawts! All of it are great!  They are located in the parking lot at Home Depot. There are two benches there if you choose to eat there. Many customers end up eating there while talking to the workers.  Had one today, and will continue to be a regular customer.

It's not a bad place! Reminds me of a yogurt shop we use to visit when we lived in Cali! It's a self serving yogurt bar, everything is at your expense. So you can't complain! They charge you by weight, and tends to get a little expensive. But that's OK, since you can build your yogurt any way you want!! The location is very clean, always offers a wide selection of flavors.

We usually stop here on our way to Cali! All three of us always order breakfast burritos and a order of taquitos. Wife get a country breakfast burrito with beans and pico. I always get a steak and egg burrito, wish the quality of the steak is better and less greasy. Daughter also gets a country burrito. Now of course that's a lot of food already, but we always add a order of taquitos no matter how early it is. This will continue to be our breakfast stop when we travel out west.

Daughter was shopping at forever 21, when I noticed Sugar Daddy a couple of doors down. So I sneaked out and strolled my butt over there. Right off the bat, I had to wait for a while until someone noticed I was there? But after being noticed, he was very apologetic and very cool. So I purchased the peanut butter cup, Elvis Presley, and the Carmel apple! The Carmel Apple is a 10+, one of the best cupcake I have ever tasted. The Elvis Presley, and Peanut Butter Cup was very good. Overall the cakes are very moist, and the frosting is not over powering. They have a lot more selection here, we will have to come back and try them.

Well,  We got the house painted, we had a pool fence installed, and our kool deck was in dire need of resurfacing. So originally we were going to get the acrylic lace redone. However, we had a few estimates done with different options. We ended up getting a flag stone stamped concrete. It looks amazing! Very happy with the results, and really made our pool area special. Since I was at work during the repairs, they worked with my wife. They explained everything to her, the types of patterns, and colors. Even when she had an issue with one of the colors. They had no problem changing it.  We look our new pool deck, very excited to show it off!

Very useful facility, it was New Years eve and I needed my prescription refilled. My pharmacy could not do auto fill since my doctor denied it. Now I was caught off guard, since when I get my auto dial from them. I assume its just a reminder for my prescription. Apparently they were trying to notify me that my doctor denied it! Well my doctor office was closed for the day and I had to get my prescription. This place brought me in and checked me out, and gave me a prescription. I would have been out of my medicine for about four days.  Great place, nice people

1st! It's american oil!!! 2nd! Lowest price in town! 3rd! It has a car wash! 4th! Has a red box to rent movies!  Not to bad, it also has most of everything that other gas station/convenient stores have!  I usually stop of here on the way to my weekend job! Get my 5 hr energy drink, diet coke, then I'm good for the night! The only problem you might have with this location, might be the construction on the 303 fwy. Lots of traffic at times.

Have always liked Sam's Club over Costco. Since we moved to Surprise, Sam's Club is our only choice! This place has a huge parking lot, very easy to access, just like any other warehouse, not much to ad. Their bakery is great, always sending out fresh bread. Our biggest fave is their pizza, not there cooked? But their pre-made refrigerated pizza is awesome. Just take it home and pop in the oven for 15 minutes. A very good pizza! But their snack bar is awesome also. Pizza and dogs are great!!

Before I give our daughter one of our cars, I needed to replace the tint on the rear window. It was hard to see out of it and it was poorly done previously by someone else.  Randy was real easy to work with, I was able to drop off the car a day earlier to satisfy my schedule. We picked the car up yesterday and it looks real nice. I did noticed some bubbles, and he explained to me with these cars that has a lot of dimples on their window. It's impossible to make it perfect. I already knew there was an issue with that, so It wasn't a problem. As time goes on and if there is any problem or not, I'll revise this review up or down. But as of now everything is just fine.

Really neat place hidden in the back of the 1920's bungalow called The Country Maiden  in the Catlin Court Historic District in downtown Glendale. They have a nice selection of ice cream, and the courtyard is very relaxing.  Here is a couple of tips, They carry Karen's Kreamery ice cream and Frosty Paw frozen treats for your dog! I never knew they were here, glad I found them on yelp!

The Arizona Diamondbacks is a fun organization to watch. Can't say they are not trying.  Let me first get the one problem I have with them. "STOP TRYING TO MAKE THE DODGERS A RIVAL" This will never happen. The Dodgers already have a hundred year old rivalry with the Giants. And that doesn't include the interstate rival Padres, and just down the freeway rival Angels. So you are not a member!  With that said, the wife and I have been averaging about 15-20 games a year since we moved to the valley six years ago. Our favorite time to attend are the weekday daytime games. Their offense is explosive, they need to with the pitching they have.  I have never had any issues at a game. Since most of the fans there are transplants and just baseball fans. Everyone are there to have a good time.

I usually come here on Wednesday morning. This is when I am at work by 5:00 am. Holds me over until a reasonable lunch time. Actually sometimes it holds me over until dinner. I always order a chili verde and egg burrito. Not on their menu, always willing to make it for me. Love this breakfast burrito, use to visit my grandmother here in Phoenix when I was a child and she would make this for me all the time. Now this burrito is huge, and very filling. Plenty of pork in the chili. I might not get there every week, but it will be a lot.

Let you know right away!! I have never been fond of AT&T!!! So this review may be bias!!!! We have been here about four times, actually as I am writing this review! My wife is there now replacing her phone. Service can be tough at times! My biggest problem is you can call AT&T and talk to them on the phone, when you get to a location. They don't offer you the same deals!! Always some excuses!! Always want to sell you something you don't need. Wife goes there now without me, because I won't take their crap. When I have a chance to opt out of their, I'm gone!!!

Since Ace Hardware is just down the street from our home, I come here quite a bit. Unless I want to save some money, I'll take the time to visit Lowe's or Home Depot. But this place will have items that are hard to find elsewhere. Always have the items I needed, very friendly staff willing to help you at all times. Wonder whats going to happen to this place when they eventually build the Home Depot near by at the Prasada?

The Spotlight Youth Theatre is a great place to enjoy a night out with the family. This is a youth program that educate and empower youth through the performing arts. Very small and secluded place, most people don't even knows that it's here. They do about 6 musicals every season, the kids are very talented. My wife comes here and donates her time during each showing. Well last week I had no choice, and had to see Rug Rats. I am not a big fan of youth shows! Yes they are for a great cause,  But after going through 4 years of my kids high schools plays/musicals. I had enough of it! However, I wished we knew about this place. This would have been a great added experience for our kids.  After watching Rug Rats, the crew is very good. And I had a better time then I thought I was going to have. It's very little inside, but plenty of seating. This place  needs everyones support and it would be nice to see more people there.

FOLKS!!! One thing that amazes me is that the Coyotes does not draw more fans! I'm not saying there is enough Coyotes fans? But with all of the snowbirds, and retirement population here from the northern states! At least you would think they would come and support the teams they were from? Ever since we moved out here we have made a commitment to support the Coyotes! Yes we are huge Kings fans! But that doesn't mean we don't care for this team. Never saw a team with so much heart! Especially what they have to go through not knowing if they are going to be here next year again!!! No owners! Bad location! Even though Glendale is closer, team would serve better if they played out of the US Air Arena!!! Afraid we are going to lose this team to Seattle! Come on fans! Support this team!

During my search for great tasting Carne Asada, we decided to stop here on our way home. Food City focuses to the Latin community, and what's a better place to find great carne asada then a Latin grocery store? I have been to food city before. It's not my preference, but it's not a bad store. Now the plan was to run in, get the carne, and run out. But the six year old had other plans! So we ran in, had to stop and get a Tamarind lollipop! Then we ended up getting a bottle water, now we finally got to the meat butcher! Got my carne, tried to go back the same way so the six yr old won't find something else. By the time we got to the cashier, we ended up getting a box of cereal, yogurt, water, and her lollipop!  Food City has a great selection of fruit, meat, and seafood. Did I find a great place to purchase our carne asada in the future? I think so! We cooked it on Fathers Day, and everyone loved it. Have no complaints, and will continue to go there in the future.

After visiting our Aunt in Goodyear, we ended stopping here for a bite. I have always enjoyed Red Robin, enjoy their selection of different burgers. There was nothing wrong with their food. Food was good as usual, but their service here was not acceptable. I can go down the list and make them sound like one of the worst restaurants around. But I don't want to do that! Basically, their service was very slow. Seems like they really didn't care? There were people on the floor texting on their phones, gathering together and chatting. In the mean time this affected their service, not getting the food out in a timely matter, had us asking every time if we can get refills on our drinks. And during all of this time they stepped over food and a wash rag left on the floor next to us. Finally when we were almost done, someone decided to pick it up and clean the area. This place was not busy, place was half full, and over staffed. But yet they had a hard time doing their job. There is no doubt that the management needs to step up at this location, customers do not want to deal with this. Would we go to Red Robin again? Yes, but at this locations? I doubt it.

On my way to Kingman, I wanted a breakfast burrito at Filiberto's next door. Wanted something to drink besides a soda, since Shell and Filiberto's are right next to each other. They actually have a door you can have access to either place. This location is very clean, well air condition, very comfortable place. Their inventory is very large. It's like your usual mini-mart gas station. I have no complaints about this place, very convenient with Filiberto's next door.

Been here a few times, only because we live near by. In the evening this place usually has a long line. They are usually under staff here, so the wait is long. When the employees are busy and in a rush they will usually make mistakes. Management really needs to help out and make sure customer service is a number one priority! I try to avoid this location and go somewhere else.

Very nice place, I have recently obtained a guitar that has been in the family since the 60's. It has been used and shows it! But I wanted to get it back into a condition that we can display and pick it up time to time to mess around with it. I am really happy with the results, they cleaned it and re-strung it. It is now displayed in our up-stair loft with pride, it sounds great, and hopefully it will be with the family many more years to come.

For some reason, I really thought I reviewed this already?? Any who! I just recently brought some family members here. Wife and I have been here three other occasions. The casino is fun, can get crowded during the winter! (Snowbirds in town). My only issue, they really don't have a sport  book! Or an area were some of us men would like to set back, watch some games, drink some beer, and eat. They do have a small area by the Keno area, but it's not much. Overall we always have a good time here, but we will try out the other casinos just to see how it is.

Wow! what a fun place! I love coming here once in awhile. You get two! That's right Two features, just like the old days! Place is very large, have plenty of room. Now on family nights it can get crowded, also remember! This is a good place to bring your family! Please drive slowly! You also have to remember, this is a drive-in. It's not going to be like watching a movie at a theater. Sound is only as good as your system. But it's a great experience!

The Filiberto's of the West Valley!!! Really like this place! I have been here about three times, get the same old steak and egg burrito, w/beans and potato's! And of course add a little bit of pico! Never been disappointed, a very large serving, and has had very good service. Place looks like its closed down! But it's not, they just blacked the windows to keep the sun out! Family keeps on asking me when I will take them? Soon!

Wife and I decided to stop by the casino after work. So we had dinner at the Blue Coyote Cafe, since it was Saturday. The Casino and Cafe were very busy. So we were seated outside, it was a very cool evening. But the portable heaters did their job. Now only if the waitress did hers. Since we were outside we felt like we were forgotten. We shared a bacon cheese burger with fries and added fruit. Burger was excellent, filled us both up. When we were outside, the manager came by a few times to check on us, and the helpers made sure we had plenty of water. But we had to wait for ever for our food, to ask for our check, and even to get our check. Then we had to wait for our sign receipt. Food, prices if it's not a steak are good. Service still needs help! Would I try this place again? If it's food, I'll try anything twice!!!!!

On my way home from visiting my father at the Hospital! Wife's at work,not in the mood to cook this late in the evening!!! I haven't had my yearly splurge of McRibs!!!! So I stopped off at this location, pretty big place! Walked in, because drive through was pretty busy. Only one person in front of me, it was time for me to order! I order the McRib Sandwich Combo, she asked me if I wanted it large! Well no, but thanks for asking! Then she offered me a second sandwich for only .99 cents!!! Wow, well yes! I love to have my yearly McRib sandwich, It's a great time! This half hour of eating this great icon of a sandwich was amazing! You get that stamped piece of pork, lathered in a authentic BBQ sauce and loaded up with pickles and onions, Yea baby!!!! It's only one time a year, and just once! After that I'm good for another year!! Going back to this location, it was quite nice. Very clean, bilingual, and great service!

We were on another road trip, so that means! Looking up and see what food joint has been on TV? Naked City was on DDD, never seen the episode and was very skeptic about eating here? With my wife, daughter and her boyfriend with me. It was around 11:00 pm, after our Les Miserables show at The Smith Center. Wasn't sure if I wanted to bring my wife and daughter here? Place is not in the best area, and it's inside of a bar!! Moondoggies! But after we sat down and trying to talk with each other with the screaming, yelling, rock music on! We started to eat our food! Now with the shift change at the bar, the music changed! All of sudden we started to hear Journey, Boston, and Chicago! Music we can just lay back and listen to! Got myself my first Red Apple Ale, which I sucked down in 1 min! Now back to the food, we order three large ground beef tacos! Order the small! Large is like a burrito, just to large and ask for cheese, doesn't come with? There taco sauce is more of a buffalo wing sauce? I had no problem with it, it was different. But the girls did not like it! We also ordered a large pepperoni pizza, daughter ordered a side of large fries! Fries were very good, daughter loved it, can't really explain it? But there fries are different, and very good. Now their pizza! We all loved it, I can seriously say this was probably my favorite pizza of all time! Dough was thick but very crispy! I love the thin and crispy, when I seen the thickness of this I wasn't sure about it at first! Very cheesy, perfect amount of sauce and pepperoni were very good. Think I found my pizza place in Vegas! Glad we stopped by, had a great time to end our evening.

Just like a lot of other people, I wanted to try this place out since I seen them on Man vs Food! Now they are on the Best Sandwich in America contest, I really wanted to see what this place was all about! I went there during my lunch hour, 1st thing is they got me in and out of there really fast! Service was very fast and very courteous. The only thing I did not like was when it got slow, all of the girls who works there, had nothing to do. So they all huddled together and started to chat! I pretty sure management would rather have them use their time better. I ordered their Reyes torta! Only because this was their iconic sandwich, it was pretty good! But for me it was just to much ingredients! I want to go back and just try a simple one item torta! The Reyes has beef, pork, ham, chorizo, eggs, hot dogs, etc.., I can just go on forever! Again, it was a good sandwich, but I am more of a simple sandwich person. Their salsa for their chips were awesome! Nothing I had before, great taste, with a little fire! I'll let you know how my second visit go's! But yes! If you have not tried this place, it's a must visit place!!

Had to send a package out, parking lot was only a 1/4 full. Only about four people in line, only problem here was the customers asking to damn many questions. The workers were all nice and helpful. Got me right in, slapped on the label and shipped it out! No problem!

Pizza was just plain, nothing special. I have always feel when you make a pizza, something needs to be special! Sauce, dough, or cheese? Something! Their pizza has absolutely nothing special, nothing to brag about.

We have been shopping here since we moved here, and haven't changed! Yes we have tried the local Albertson, and Safeway. But Fry's seems to have lower prices and it's very convenient for us. Just right down the street from us, and it has almost everything we need including fuel for our vehicles. When my mother comes down to visit us, this is the first place she wants to go. She just loves this place!

Not going to try and act like a food critic here! If you are looking to try this place, then you already know about Seasons 52. Wife, daughter, and myself came here on a Saturday for our wedding anniversary! I had their chili, and buffalo burger. I was amazed how moist and good the burger was. Wife and daughter had flat breads! Over all place was very good and if you are looking into eating healthier. Place is a good choice!

This place is amazing! Since I was kicked out of my house! (my 20 yr old daughter wanted to have a romantic dinner with her boyfriend!) I took the wife out! I have heard about iPic, but never looked into it! So we seen the women in black! (Great Movie) We had the premium seats, which I knew it was a risky move! It doesn't take much for momma to fall asleep! Now of course, my wife had a hard time at first. She is not use to of experiencing some of the luxurious stuff. She is a penny pincher and loves to save. But after she sat down, reclined back, layed her head into the pillow, covered herself in a blanket, and yes kicked off her shoes! I thought there was no way she was going to make it through the movie! We order our diet coke(free refills) we also received free popcorn, and we ordered from their large menu, mozzarella sticks. Every thing was awesome! Food was great, soda, and popcorn was great! Now the only reason why they did not receive a five star!!! The waiter was to loud, through out the movie, he was taking orders, even and the end of the movie, the couple behind us had to ask how the movie ended, since the waiter was trying to get them to pay their bill at that time? They should wait until the movie is over? There is only one way out of the theater, when you exit. But this is a place we (wife and I only) will come back!

OK, We came back! But we did have company, I decided to give my wife and daughter a iPic and Tanzy Christmas gift! Had a 10am Les Miserables show on Christmas day. We had a great time, maybe this might be a yearly thing now? This was my daughters first experience, and was wowed!! Movie was very good, girls liked it and cried through out the movie. We had our lunch during the show and it was great! (See the Tanzy review for food rating!) Yes the prices are higher but you are getting a lot more. No I can not afford doing this all the time, but yes wife and I will come back again and again.

1st this is a review of their food only, we did not stay at the restaurant! They have three options. 1) Tanzy Restaurant - Dine In 2) Tanzy Express - Take Out 3) iPic Experience - Dine in the movie theater  We did option three, first the price is a little high. But when you are already willing to spend on a iPic experience, then you might as well go all out. Which I did taking out my two favorite girls! I had their Angus burgers sliders, truffle fries, and a diet coke. Sliders were excellent! A lot of flavor, cooked at medium well. Truffle fries were a little salty. But then again, I do not add salt to anything so I am the wrong person to advise on salt!! Wife had the pepperoni flat bread, since I had some! It was pretty good, thought it was a regular pizza. Daughter had the burger sliders and tater tots w/bacon ketchup! Daughter has always been a tater tot person and she was not disappointed! She kept on telling us how great the bacon ketchup was! SO!!  FOOD!! - was great, will eat there food again!! PRICE! - A bit high, but with the experience! It was well worth it!  Hopefully I can write you a update on the restaurant experience instead of the iPic experience?

Since I moved to Arizona, I had to find a new Dentist! The only reason why I visited this place? Because it was very close to home. I was really impressed with this place. Compare to other Dentist I used in California, it's no contest! I was really amazed at the advancement of technology, and every one is really nice. Starting this new year I will also enroll my wife and daughter.

This is a cool little shop just open recently, offers a great selection of  nostalgic, and import candies hard to find. They also offer candy you can find anywhere. I suggest you buy those at the nearest supermarket, since they are a little pricey here. This is a great store to get that hard to find candy! They have a huge selection of candies and soda! You can spend some time here going through everything remembering some of the candies you use to eat as a child! It's great that it's right next to the movie theater! It's a great place to visit!

Love Baskin-Robbins much more then Stone Cold! Wished we had more in the Valley,  After having a hard time finding some local Thrifty ice cream open on Sunday? i used the powerful yelp finder for a ice cream near you locator! It brought me here. This place is a little small, can be very cramped if busy. But as usual, they had a lot of different flavors of ice cream. I haven't been to BR in years, since I lived in SoCal.  Service was great, had plenty of help there, gave our girls samples to try, and very patient. We really enjoyed our visit, and will come back if were in the area.

I was in a rush again! Didn't really want to stop off here, but I am really glad I did! I ordered their grilled steak burrito. OMG!!!! Man that was good! grilled steak, lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, and guacamole. This is a big burrito, and I managed to handle this all by myself! The steak of course is carne' asada, and it is marinated to perfection. Again, glad I came back and gave them another chance!

Great field, Caught a D-back and Brewer game. Great place to watch a game. Many selection for food and drinks. If you don't feel like sitting at your seats, many options to watch while standing in the shade. Parking is very accessible, but the only issue I had was, you drive through a shopping center to get there. Traffic backs up in that area, there is another access rd on the north side on Pima Rd. That looks like a better option. We had a great time, glad we had the oppertunity to check out a game here.

Now you have to realize, I am a race fan. So all you need for me is a oval track and cars! I was very spoiled by living is socal! Irwindale is a top of the line race track in the nation. But after coming here last Saturday, I had a ball. First of all I was just happy to find a race track in the area. After living here for just lest than a year, I am just was estactic that this place even existed! Now you have to realize, this place looks like a track they put together as cheap as they can to offer their fans racing. And that OK with me. Safety fence is basically just a chain link fence, so I do worry about that. But you are up close and see all of the action through out. I do have a problem with all of the smoking going on in the stands. Especially when smokers do not care about the little ones around. But other than that I will become a regular!

Well, It was fathers day weekend, mother decided to visit from Cali. It was about 110 degrees outside, and most likely getting out of town would have been a hassle. So we took the kids to the library at White Tanks. I have always wanted to stop by to check this place out. This is definitely a hidden gem. Kids had a ball, there was plenty of things there to keep them busy. Games, coloring, reading, watching movies, and all kinds of activities. They also have about six different kinds of rattlesnakes, three king snakes, and a gila monster on display. There was an actual feeding at 1:00 that day. There is also coffee and snacks for the adults. You can enjoy the view and drink your cup of joe. It's a must see place, especially if you want to get out of the heat. Kids and adults will love this place.

When we are in a mood for something light, we'll come here to pick up a sami! There is not much you can say about a franchise. Food is usually the same everywhere. Only thing we can really add is their service. Some times they might have a large size line, but they go through it very fast! Very friendly staff, even though they tend to have Friends their to chat! If it's cool outside they have enough seating. But when you prefer inside during the heat. It tends to get crowded. Overall a very nice location.

Once again, A review lost in the Yelp black hole. I know I did a review on this before! Anyway, Wife and I had the foster kids, and Mom with us. We decided to meet our daughter and boyfriend for dinner. We were supposed to eat somewhere else, however something happened and I was in a rush to find a place. I have heard of Don Pancho, but did not know this was a hole in the wall joint. When we arrived here, I was like no way! Not going to eat here. It was getting late and my mom was like, the kids are hungry and lets just eat here.  1st,  There was ten of us, 2nd, Don Pancho was going to close in a half hour. However they said not a problem. So they put a few tables together for us and we all sat down.  We ordered all sorts of items. I had the chili verde burrito, it was great. My mom and some kind of quesadilla. It was corn and fried. It was awesome. I had the luxury to try many items that night, and I can not say there was anything bad.  Workers there are really nice, they did not have to serve us so late, but they did and I am glad. Prices are very reasonable, Food is great.   They fooled me, I wasn't interested to eat here, but thanks to mom. We tried it and can't wait to come back.

Place just opened not to long ago, Wife and I wanted something simple, so we tried quite a few things! I had their Italian Beef sandwich, it was very tasty, nice cut on the beef and you have a options with hot peppers or sweet peppers, I tried it with the sweet so my wife can try it. One of the best sandwich I have had for a very long time. Wife had their cheeseburger, this was also very good, Then we shared their hot dog, its a Vienna beef dog, served on a kysor bun. Place is a Chicago style food joint, which I am not very accustom to, but what ever it is, it's very good. We will diffidently eat here often.

This place is pretty good! First location is Arizona, and the daughter wanted to try it. Never knew there was one close to us in SoCal? I had the BBQ bacon burger with fries. Daughter and Wife had the cheeseburger. Place reminds me a lot of In-n-Out, the food is different though! My burger was very good, next time I will try the tri-tip sandwich. Wife and daughter enjoyed their burger also. We have had better, but we also have had worse! So do not get your expectation up so high, but I would come back again!

Wife and myself was out and about, spending some time together! We were actually across the street at totally wine, when we were a little hungry. Wife was told by her friend that Raul & Theresa's was a must try. Now here friend is a frequent customer at the Avondale location! So we ended up giving this place a try. Now when you first come in, this is not a restaurant that most people expect! It reminds me a lot like a fast food   atmosphere? Since we weren't that hungry, wife ordered their child's plate taco and cheese enchilada, I ordered the carne asada torta. I was happy their torta is small, since I just wanted to have a small meal! Their torta was all right! Wasn't that special at all, carne asada was not that great, just plain. Wife said there rice was great, everything else was OK. Now this is not the worst place we have been at, but it wasn't even close of being a great place to go! But if we are in the area again, we just might try it again.

Never been to Karen's Kreamery, here or at the old location. I was lucky enough to try their products at the Surprise Stadium during a ball game. I was actually in line next to their booth waiting on a order I placed. I over heard some lady asking for a lemonade, she received a frozen lemonade instead. She was complaining this is not what she ordered. So I took it off her hand. Three frozen lemonades later, I am sold!! Family and I are planning to visit Karen's Kreamery in the near future. Can't wait!!!

Since the mother in-law, sister in-law, and grandmother in-law were in town, I took all three and my wife to the Talking Sticks Resort. I really didn't want to go,(bowl games were on). So I ended up by the Keno Area watching the games, noticed Black Fig and ordered their wings, fries, and a soda. First, they give you a lot to eat. I did not finish it, wings were good, sauce wasn't over powering. fries were good and crispy. They have free refills for their sodas! Service were very good, girls were very helpful. Not a bad place to order food, if you just want to hang out , play keno, and watch games!

Since our daughter moved to Tempe, wife and I will take the hour drive to see her once in awhile! So, the wife, our two foster daughters and I packed up and hauled to Tempe. One of the reason why I moved out of SoCal, was traffic. One of the reason why I hate Tempe, is traffic. Anyway, the main reason why we took the trip. So our daughter could meet the foster kids for the first time.  We have been wanting to try Oregano's, so we decided to try this location out. One thing I have noticed since we have had our foster kid's are trying to find a place where they like the food. They are not use to restaurants, they love fast foods. So we were seated, ordered our drinks quickly, and a cheese bread appetizer. Their cheese bread was amazing if you like garlic! Our six yr old had the kids meal cheese pizza, our seven yr old was the tough one. She was acting like she didn't want to eat there. Knowing that she like spicy food, I ordered hot wings and a large pepperoni pizza half with jalapenos. Our daughter had the chicken Parmesan, and wife had the penne pesto. I can tell the six year old enjoyed the food, WHY! She ate her whole personal pizza, had two hot wings,sampled the wife's penne, and daughters parmesan!  The seven year old did like the pizza, and hot wings. I myself thought the food was good. I did request the pizza to be well done, like the crust crispy. However the waiter advised not to since their crust is extra thin and will burn the crust. After getting the pizza, wished they would have cooked it longer.  We had a great time, the girls loved our daughter, food was good. Now for the cons! We felt the waiter was rushing us through out our time there? We were not ever half way done with our food and he was already asking us about dessert, and boxes for our food? And prices, I,m OK with shelling out hundred dollars for dinner. This place just doesn't seem to be a place I would enjoy spending that kind of money. This is why I almost gave this place a 3-star review. But the overall experience we had, was well worth it. We had fun, girls enjoyed the dinner.

I signed up an e-mail alert months ago with Sweet Salvage. Finally we had the opportunity come out and check them out. I was expecting this place to be a lot larger, but that did not prevent them having a decent inventory.  Sweet Salvage is only open every 3rd weekend of each month, that is the third Thurs - Sun of each month! They get new inventory for each show! Almost like watching The American Pickers on TV! You start seeing a lot of old stuff in there! Wife and I will be going here more regularly, hopefully to find that needle in the haystack?  The only disappointment I had was, when we left. We wanted to check out more salvages and antiques. Sweet Salvage is in a area where there are a lot more antique stores around, but they were all closed. I don't know about you! But if I owned the other Antique stores, I would take advantage of the increased customer traffic and stay open late during the monthly shows!

I guess this place has been there for a while. But I don't ever remember seeing it. Anyway, its next to a couple of antique stores across the street from the park. My mom went in for some local honey, and we ended up buying cookies, honey, and coffee. Cookies are really thick, almost like eating a cake. Mom enjoyed the coffee.  People their are very nice and the store is very kept up.

Again, Place just recently opened! Actually they have not officially opened? They are in training, and they need it! I am excited about them opening a burger joint this far west! But boy do they need to improve! First of all, prices are way to high! Pastrami sandwich for $8.00! Really, Chicken dinner for $12.00! Service is horrible, burgers, fries, onion rings are not that impressive. Yes they are new! Yes they deserve a chance! Yes I will go back at a later time! Yes! we need a burger joint out here, but do not take advantage of us, lower your prices and have faster service! Or you will not last!

The wife and I wanted to try something new, so I was driving around and was actually going some where else in the area. When I remembered we wanted to try Caballero out! I really like the decor of the restaurant, a lot of wood work! Well, we were seated as soon we arrived. The hostess was very nice, and quickly recognized that the waitress was to busy. So the hostess took our drink order and had another waitress take care of us. Usually we share a plate, but occasionally when we go to a restaurant for the first time we get two different dishes to try. I ordered their green chili pork plate! I grew up on chili verde, and like many different versions. The version at Caballero's is very good, and reminds me of my grandmother use to make it. Has a nice kick and generous portions of pork! Plate also comes with rice and black beans. Wife ordered their pull pork stacker, its as good and looks as it sounds!! Pull pork sandwich with cole slaw, and french fries piled on the sandwich. This was one of the best sandwich I have had is a while! Loved the zesty taste of their BBQ sauce! Over all we had a great experience and will diffidently come back again!!

Really didn't want to come here, but the girls were down.(their visitation with their parents were cancelled) So I thought sitting by the aquarium might brighten their day?  So we arrived there around 5:00pm, not that many people there yet. We were able to sit by the shark tank, and the kids were in awe. I ordered the half rack of pork ribs. It came with two sides, i had the fries, and potato salad. Wife had the chicken club salad. The kids was OK with their chicken strips and cheese burger, but they were to involved with the tank.  I personally was not that impressed with the food that night. Paying $20 for a half slab of ribs, you would think there would be more meat on the ribs? Again, another place with ribs you have to fight with? Very dry, not much flavor, and did I mentioned there were no meat on the ribs. The potato salad was awe full, not what I expected! I even tried the wife's salad. Not impressed at all. Our service wasn't that great, wife ordered the salad and received and sandwich. And our server seemed to have trouble keeping up with her tables. When we first moved here four years ago. Dillon's Grand was our favorite place to eat. Since they moved, they have just kept on falling down on our list. To the point we might not visit Dillon's anymore. The quality of their food has really gone down, to bad! I love BBQ, but I might have to go east bound for that now.

Well, this is a franchise I have been meaning to try for a while! Ever since I lived in SoCal, I wanted to try Five Guys! I have always heard that they are very similar to our SoCal favorites like In-n-Out. Five Guys just opened a new franchise in Surprise! I have lived in Surprise for the last two years, and have not seen as many youngsters at one place than the night I ate at five guys! It was nice to see everyone there having a good time eating dinner! First! the only thing that is similar between Five Guys and In-n-Out was the atmosphere or the ambiance? (Trying to includes some tricky words today?) Burgers are totally different. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger w/ BBQ sauce, grilled onions. Burger was very good, my honey had the cheese burger, and we shared a large fries! Here is some tips! 1) We had way to much food, If you want one patty! Order the little burger. Their regular burgers come with two patties! 2) Wife and I could have shared an small order of fries, their larger fries is enough for four people.  Other than that we had a great time, nice trying something new, and really nice seeing a place where people can hang out and have fun.

We decided to stop off here after church, always have wanted to try this place! I ordered the build it your self skillet, o'briens potatos. bacon, bell peppers, over easy eggs on top! with a side of gravy. I really didn't want to have the gravy, so I ate this with out, this skillet had a lot of flavor! Portions are very large, service was great! Wife had the breakfast burrito, again it was very large! Came with potatos, bacon, cheese, eggs, salsa, and sour cream. She was very happy with her choice. We want to come back for lunch or dinner. Give you and update at that time!

Came back for dinner! We ordered the sloppy joe's appetizers! WOW! This was good,  this brought back some memories of how mom made them! On a very soft but toasted roll,  they pile on this great mixture of ground beef and spicy tomato based sauce! I ordered their Pork tenderloin with a caramelized base sauce! This was probably on of my favorite dishes I have every had! Until I took a bite off my wife's steak!! Her steak just melted in my mouth! Not going to lie here! But Marley;s is beginning to be our favorite place to eat now!!

Just a quick update,  Marley's is one of our favorite restaurant in the West Valley. On our last visit, I had their BBQ ribs with their new fresh cut fries. First of all, I am not a fan of their new fries. Wished they never changed! Fries were to greasy, and salty. Please go back to the old fries. Their ribs was a huge portion, I thought is was pretty good. I have had better, seen them more tender. Flavor was good, but it seemed to be more from the sauce. Glad I tried them, they have much better option on the menu.

When we moved to Arizona four years ago, never thought we would actually have children going to this school. We have two kids, one is 29 and the other is 23! So why would we ever think that? But we decided to become foster parents, now we have two more kids. One is seven and the other is 6. Our girls have big odds against them, school has never been a priority. Now with us, things has changed. It has been very hard and the kids are trying so hard! Nice to see them improving in every subject in class. Nice to see them come out of their shell and actually get involved now. Hopefully we have enough time to get them up to grade, and with the teachers they have.I think we can. This school have been a great experience, great people to work with.

We recently had a opportunity to purchase a Grandfather clock. We weren't sure if it was worth the effort? So we hired Jerry and Susan to come by and take a look at it, service it, and give us some info regarding the clock.  They came by on a Saturday, he took a look at it, and gave me an estimate for the repairs. He spend about a couple of hours taking the clock apart, cleaning it, re-greasing, and oiling it. During that time he told me a lot about the clock. He showed me how to adjust the hammers, if the time was off with in a week, he showed me how to adjust the seconds. Learned a lot from Jerry! He did a great job, clock is working great, sounds great. If I have any further issues with our clock, he will diffidently be the first person to call.

Really like this place, very wide selection. Might find that one thing you have been looking for. Been here a few times, and always find something different. Now they have expanded to the upstairs. It's even more intriguing. Workers are very nice. Prices very. You will find some junk, however you can find that needle in the haystack.

Sorry to do this but!!!! I brought my wife here for the first time after we caught a movie. It was on Sunday, during football games. Now this place was half empty, not good when you depend on the football crowd. Service was great, and very nice. We order their double pepperoni pizza, and their burger sliders. Pizza, was awful! Tasted like it was a frozen pizza!!! HOLD ON, I can find frozen pizza that taste better!!! It was even worse, when we reheated at home!! Their burger sliders were good, nothing special. Seems like the food just not that great! Now when we where there watching a game, there was a table of four playing dominoes!!! Seriously! They were loud, slamming their so called bones on the table!! Just stay home and play your game! I'm surprised they let them treat their tables like that?? But then again, when your business is slow, you start being desperate! I hate giving out 1-Star reviews, and almost gave one!!! Just put out better food, and stop allowing customers to do what they want to!!!

I wasn't to happy when I noticed this place being built! Just didn't want a car wash in our area! But I went ahead and tried this place out, since my son let me know that my truck needs a washing when I was taking him to the airport! Why didn't you tell me this when you were here earlier? He knew I was going to give him a bucket and soap! Anyways, glad I stopped by! Vacuums are free, I really don't understand why the sign says three dollar wash? There is nothing on the menu that is three dollars? I went ahead and purchased an $9.99 wash. Then Puff!!! My truck looks like it's new again!!!! I will probably become a regular customer

Never had an issue with the Filiberto's franchise. Always decent food, and always open! This one is on my way to work, sometimes at 4 in the morning! A good chili verde burritos sounds like a good way to start the day! In and out of there will fast, haven't ruined a order yet! Easy place to get in and our of there, located right off of Grand Ave.

Yes I am a CJ's fan, have been since they brought out the Western Bacon Cheeseburger in the 80's! Out of the big five! mickey d's, jack in the crack, floppers, and Wendy's. CJ's is my favorite! They have always changed their menu, always add something new, right now I like their Memphis BBQ burger! Haven't tried their breakfast biscuits, but been told they are pretty good. Not a fan of their fries, other then that, it's your typical fast food chain. This location is new, nice to see that in this area! Service is good right now. Can change as time goes on, anyway! Nice to add this option in Surprise!!

Wife and I were able to stop by, and try a few things. We had their chicken and waffles, they were OK! I kept on saying to my wife, man I have had this before. chicken reminded me of another time!! Finally hour in a half later, it struck me!!! Chicken tasted just like Swanson frozen tv dinner!!! I grew up on that! So you can take that any way you want! You need to eat the pretzels with no salt. Comes with way to much! The pretzels rolls were probably the best dinner rolls I have ever had. Since I was driving, it was a no beer night! Would like to come back and try some brats and beer. Outdoor patio is the best, on cool nights they have a great fire pit! Plenty of room, Until next time and a second visit!  Later,

We were lucky enough to receive a VIP invitation for today's grand opening! We did a lot in the three hours we were there, when you walk in it makes you feel like you are in one of the Las Vegas Casinos. Even though they claim to be a family theme bowling alley. To me it's more of a young adult theme event. But there is nothing wrong with that. To much to tell you about this place. You must pay a visit or get on there web site for more info. I felt like a kid again, playing in the arcade for a couple of hrs. Food is really good at their restaurant, especially their boom boom shrimp!! Awesome!! Again, a must visit at least once so you can see how it is.

This is the local auto parts store, and I have used this location more then a few times! They have had everything I needed, and if they don't they can always get it for you! You can also bring your used oil to be recycled! Great service, nice people, and at time very knowledgeable. My favorite thing about this place, I don't have to buy special tools! I can borrow them from O'Riellys, saves a lot of money. I will continue to use this location!

After my wife and daughter have sworn this place is the "bomb". I decided to try it our since they just opened a new location is Surprise! i had their Alex lemon ice, since this is my favorite. It was good, but not better then Karen's Kreamery version! but it's not bad! i also had a sample taste of their cherry. Now my wife and daughter loves their other options there, so when I have a chance we will go together and try other things out.

Been here a few times, have no problem! We have had their pizza, burgers, nachos, and my favorite! Coconut Shrimp! Yes, this is a little pricier! Yes, Surprise is trying to be the West Valley Scottsdale! Nothing wrong with that! It's going to take trial by error to make things better! Some of their food needs to improve, but with the choices at that area! Red Embers is a must try choice!

Had a great time with my son after a round of golf. I had just a hot dog with fries and he had a turkey sandwich with fries. Plenty of space to choose from to sit and watch a game. Service was reasonable, and the workers were very courteous. Hot dog was just fine, fries were the shoe string type. Meals were served hot and drinks were cold. Will be back again.

WOW! What a surprise, We use to eat hear when Dillons what at this location. Have not been back here since they moved. Wife over heard someone talking about Angela's, they said the food was pretty good? So we ended up trying Angela's for the first time! Well, It's now one of our favorites in Surprise. We first had their BBQ ribs appetizer, very surprised by how tender it was but also it had a crunch? Turns out after they slow cook their ribs, and the meat actually just falls off the bone. They deep fry them before serving, never heard of this before. And it worked. Wife had the BLT, not much you can do with a BLT. But it was very good. Overall we had a very good time. Service there was great, manager came by and said hello. This is going to be one of our regular stops.

Wanted to have a breakfast burrito before work, drove up and only had one car in front of me! No big deal, right? After sitting there for 15 minutes, I had to go! Was going to be late for work. Should have gotten out of the truck, and gone inside! But you would think the drive through would have been quicker?

Maybe it's because I have been spoiled through out my life, but this swap meet is horrible!! Growing up in SoCal, I have had some great swap experience! O.C. County Fair swap meet, and Santa Fe Springs Drive In swap meet were two of my favorites. Here at WestWind, this just seems to be and over sized ghetto yard sales! And the same stuff every hundred yards! Nothing here at all would want me to come back! I would understand if some of the junk sold here were worth anything, but the junk sold here is no ones treasure!! If someone knows of a decent swap meet! Please message me.

Took our dog to the doctors at Bansfield. Was hungry when we left the house and always have wanted to try Uncle Bears, which is in the same parking lot. First good thing is the patio is pet friendly! I enjoyed it when the previous establishment was Chuy's. So Uncle Bears continued the pet friendly patio. However I am not a big fan of the eat your peanuts and throw them on the floor. But the good thing is you can not take the peanuts onto the patio! So I ordered the prime rib sliders w/fries, I thought this was really great! Comes with four large sliders stuffed with caramelized onions, cheese, and thinly sliced prime rib! Folks! These are large sliders! Even though I would like to try something else next time. I am the type once I find something I enjoy at a restaurant I always get that item!! I will come back!!

We have been coming here since they opened up in 2012. Service seems to have gotten better, but I still try to avoid this place during football games. Service tends to be a lot slower during game day. However we still love coming here, we always bring our pet here with us. Food is great, and very affordable. But we just heard they will be changing their menu soon! Going more to the menu they have with the Uncle Bear's Brew menu? That means, prices will be going up as well. Hope they don't change to much, would be sad if we would have to look for another pet friendly restaurant. Until then, this is still one of our favorites!

This is a decent place to eat. We use to eat at the original's Nick's until we started to have a few issues. Later we found out that Nick's and Nick's ll are not related? Nick's ll are the original owners of Nick's, but then sold the original Nick's. Then they opened up Nick's ll, there does that explain everything? I now confused!  Anyway, I have had breakfast here a couple of times. It's pretty much the same as the original Nick's. But this place seems to be more customer service priority. You are treated a lot better here, and don't forget about you. Food is really good, I personally love their pancakes. Their bagel breakfast sandwich is very good also. There are a lot of options for breakfast in Surprise, and this is one of the better ones.

The Sky Train is great, Sky Harbor is not a large airport anyway, so this allows you to park at the economy parking lot. I park at the east side parking lot about ten to fifteen times a year. Never had a problem with it, gets you to the terminal very quickly. They also have shuttles within the parking lot to take you to the tram. Very convenient! It is a little walk to get there from the baggage claim area, but no big deal.

Huge fan of this place, because it's real close to home. This location is located next to Albertson. Parking can be busy at times. Very nice and courtesy crew. I have been coming here for two reason. My father had his account here, and my credit union in California can be serviced from here.  Service: When my father passed away last year, I had to deal with Desert Schools for my fathers financials. It was frustrated at times, they make sure all the paper work is in and they are very thorough. Basically that's a good thing. But in time, everything was able to be transferred into the estate account. I was also very surprised that they will answer their phones in person. Very convenient when you don't have much time to wait around for a call back or being placed on hold.  I was thinking about closing my credit union account, but now that I know I can make transactions here, no reason to close now!

This is a pretty neat place, It's just your typical yogurt self serve place. You come in, grab a cup, dispense your yogurt and add toppings. Then you go to the front of the counter and place it on the scale. But one thing I noticed was the time and effort they give you. As soon we walked in, someone greeted us. Walked with us to the dispensers, and asked us if we wanted to have a sample of them. Having a 6 and 7 yr old with you, this is very helpful. They even recommend us to try some of the flavors, I declined at first. But when they said I would regret it, I tried their salted caramel! Funny how that was the flavor I ended up getting.  This is something we don't usually do a lot, but when we do, It will be Razzleberriez,.

If you have automatic payments, you better check your bank statements! I caught them debiting my checking account twice! When I asked them about it, they knew there was an issue and was working on it. Supposedly I am not the only customer who got charged twice? This is why I cancelled Cox Cable, charging me something with out a notice? Looks like it's time to cancel my automatic payments.  AGAIN!!! Check your bank statements!

Came here since it was the closest Sears in the west valley. Wanted to look at a few things. What a mess! Clothes just thrown everywhere! Kids running around like it was a park. Wanted to try out a couple of treadmills. However they were all broken by the kids. Workers, let get on this? Clean up the place, Tell the parents to control their kids or they would have to leave.

This was formally known as White Eagle, It has recently re-open under the name of Eddie's European Bistro. Wife and I was a fan of White Eagle, only problem was you never knew when it was going to be open? Place has been renovated, smaller dining room, but still enough room. Looks like the same people still works there, and the food seems to be the same! But looks like they now offer a wider menu. Again, we liked it before and will continue to come back!

Wife and I are looking for a new fridge, so this was one of our stops. They have a decent inventory, however we got tired of hearing how they work on commission and make sure we ask for them by name! I understand you need to make a living, but after you gave me your card. You do not need to continue and explain to me that you work off of commission three more times!

This is something I might have to come back to and try it out again. Took the family out for Glendale Glitters, and noticed this place for the first time. Walked in and asked them, I haven't noticed them before. They have just opened up! Bought a couple of hot chocolate, Twinkies cupcake, and chicken soup.  1) Cupcake sucked!! to dry, to sweet, just not good! 2) Soup was OK, but could be better. 3) Since they just opened! They did not have a lot of products, cups, utensils!  This must improve if they want to stick around.   We will give them another try in a few months, give you a update then!!

Yep! It's open, With the growth of Surprise, there are going to be a whole lot more restaurants, fast food joints, and many other things opening around here. Taco Bell is one of the first! What can I say? I am a Taco Bell believer, really fell in love with them in my bachelor days! Saved me a lot of money! Love there flavored meat, and yes the are beef! Don't care what anyone says! Just like any other fast food joint! Service is the same, you get what you paid for people! Glad they open up!!

Love this place,  Since I moved the the valley about six years ago. I have become a frequent visitor to this cell lot. There is always enough room, you can actually see the update board from any location in the lot. There are bathrooms, even though it's an outhouse. It's better then nothing. They also have the airlines "800" numbers posted for your convenience. Just come in, find a parking spot, recline your seat, turn up the radio and take a nap!

I have been coming here since me and the family moved here in 2010. I have been seeing Dr. Fala, very nice guy. I have a weight issue and he is always seemed to be concerned. He is always giving me advice, time for me to start listening to him. Nice crew even took me in when I was late.

Had our foster parenting training in the area, wanted a burger and yelped it. This is what came up! Burgers are great here! It's a little burger shack with a big taste! I had a cheeseburger with onions and bacon. Wife just had a cheeseburger. First, burgers come with two patties. So be ready to eat. We also had fries, which it was good. Only reason why it did not get five stars? I first wanted a vanilla shake, nope no ice cream at the time. Then I wanted a lemonade, nope lemons are not in season. Other then that it was a great visit.

Well, the Yelp black hole strikes again! Wife, daughter, and myself ate here about six years ago. This was before we moved to the valley. What I can remember about this place, very small, limited seating, had to wait outside in the heat. With that said, food was great, service was very good. I had pancakes, OJ, I could remember daughter loved the eggs, bacon, and potatoes. I wife enjoyed the food also. Haven't been back, because how small it is. But as much I am at the airport. I have been to that location a few times.

Been here a few times, and actually thought I written a review before? Really thought they were crazy when they opened up right next to Booty's. They offer a wider menu then Booty's, and is a lot less noisier! Me and some fam were here a couple of times this past weekend. Their food was great, and service was just as good. i had their BBQ burger, only issue I had was there was no BBQ sauce on the burger? But the burger was still good, the next day we all shared a large garlic, tomato, and pepperoni pizza. This was very good as well. I will still continue to go next door for their wings. But tailgaters is a great place to eat.

Been here a few times, wife loves it because of their hot dogs. Burgers or steakburgers as they call it, is pretty good. This location always have a great environment, and is always clean.    Seems like they are always busy and always have a lot of high school kids working there, so patients is needed at times. Now for their hot dogs: Wife likes them, buns are buttered toasted. Dogs are a all Vienna Beef hot dog. And they are pretty good. Steakburgers are actually very good, they look very thin, and smashed. But the flavor are very good. Should at least try them! Our experience has always been positive, and enjoyable.

Been hearing a lot about this place and wanted to try it out,  Rito's is a little dive off of Reems, Supposedly they have another location elsewhere. So the girls and I came in for dinner, thank fully we had an early dinner. Rito's closes at 6:00pm! Kind of early to close?  So we walked in, and ordered: Green Chili Burrito Red beef enchilada Shreaded beef tacos we also added a side of rice and beans.  Their drinks only come in bottles or cans, when we ordered the drinks he was more worried about the girls spilling the drinks on the floor then taking my order. We haven't even sit down yet and the owner is already complaining. Since this is a very small place, seats are limited. When someone asked if she can move two table together so they can sit four people. He replied not to slide the table but to pick up the tables so they don't scratch the floor. Again, he wanted to confront the situation, All he had to do was to say no problem, I'll take care of it for you?  With all of this said, Their green chili burrito is amazing! I grew up with hatch green chili. When my grandmother passed away I have been looking for anything close to her chili verde. Sylvia's La Canasta on Indian School Rd have been very close to that taste, however Rito's just became my favorite place to get my green chili! It blows me away how some of the reviews on here are criticizing their chili verde! Sorry, but if you don't like the chili verde from Rito's, then you don't know how green chili is suppose to taste like!  The girls loved their tacos, the red beef enchilada was good. I am not a huge fan of their sauce, I prefer Garcia's on 35th Ave enchilada sauce.  The owner needs to lighten up a bit, Surprise is a grave yard for a lot of business, and I wouldn't want to see this place on its list. Rito's really needs to get a fountain machine. Being overcharged on cans and bottles will only last for so long. And you need to extend your hours!  I absolutely recommend this place for their food!

I don't like buffets so I ordered their Philly cheese steak. Very good! think cut steak with onions and peppers with cheese! Fries were no big deal, wife had a burger and enjoyed it very much. This is one of three restaurants in the casino, everything else are in the fast food court. Also is the only restaurant open in the morning. We enjoyed it, and no issues with our server. You pay at the cashier on your way out. Very nice crew, and came by quite often to make sure things are well. When we come back I would like to try the other options first before I come back here.

Had my annual blood work done this past week. I usually go to labcorp, however they are no longer a in network facility. I was told to use Sonora Quest Labs, I called in the day before to see If I can make a appointment. They were booked until the next day. The receptionist at the front desk told me if I don't mind waiting for a bit, to walk in. So the next morning I came in and was called in with in a half hour. Everyone was nice, facility is really clean. Only reason why it was only warranted four stars! The man that was probing my arm for the vein was using me as a pin cushion. Still a great place to use.

Archie is now at a new location, they are located at a place that has gone through four other franchises in four years! Takes a lot of guts to make this move. I was never that impressed with them at their old location, this is why I have only been their a couple of times. But recently the wife and I had breakfast there. It was great! I had their bacon, egg, cheese , and bagel sandwich. Very good, going to have it again. Also shared the cinamon apple pancakes. I will never know why I always want to try this special pancakes when I just love the plains! But this was good anyway.  ,Make sure you're hungry, lot's of food, and great dessert.

This location was OK. Like other Crocker Barrel, has the rocking chair in the front, you have to walk through the gift shop to get seated. Food was good, I really enjoyed the fried chicken. Didn't realize how good their chicken is. Was not that impressed with the biscuit and gravy. Service was OK, waitress was over whelmed. She needed help.

We had a very good experience here. We were on our way come from a foster parent training class. Since our three foster kids were very good during the two class, we decided to give them a special treat. Tell you the truth, only reason why we came here. Because it was still opened. So all five us came in and ordered a dozen. My favorite has always been the chocolate glazed whipped cream filled. Kids had there favorites, then we all tried some of the fancies.  It was a good time, service was good, place was cleaned, price was reasonable.

It was my birthday and I really wanted to try something we haven't been to before.This is another establishment I have heard about for awhile. So I packed up the girls and headed north bound on the 303. We arrived there around 4:30, just before the dinner rush. We were greeted and seated immediately. Our waiter took our drink order very quickly and took our order. Since we never been there before we asked what he recommended for dinner, so he gave us a few ideas. I ordered the fried chicken, It was smothered with their gravy on top w/the chicken on their mashed potatoes, this dish also came with some vegi's. I really enjoyed the chicken, it was cooked with some good spices and it was not dried. Potatoes still had their peelings but thats the way I like it. Now their vegi's had a mixture of peas, squash, zucchini, broccoli, and carrots. I am not a peas person so I didn't even touch that. Their carrots were amazing, I would order the vegetables just for the carrots. Since I like chili, I had to order their mama's chili. This chili is great, might be a little spicy to some. But it has an amazing taste. Wife had their gringo burger and she loved it, gave me a bite and it was really good.  The girls had the burger, and chicken tenders. Seemed they both really enjoyed their meals. We had a great time! Food was great, service was great, and the atmosphere was great. We will diffidently come back again.

This place recently opened, it didn't take long for them to open their doors after Poblano shut their doors. Have been here a few times, and really enjoyed this place. My favorite is their Mexican Steak Burger, it's your usual burger except has added chipotle sauce, pepper jack cheese. I have had their sonoran dog, first time I ever had one and really enjoyed it. Glad they open this place up,

Been to a few Texas Roadhouse locations. This is one of the better ones. Crew were very courteous, and began service right away. I had the pork ribs with fries. Very good, and tender. Gave us plenty of bread, and of course the peanuts were already on the table. Overall had a very good time.

My cousin dragged me down to Mesa for a game. I really didn't want to go, didn't want to drive all the way to Mesa.  So we strolled down to Cubs park for a game with the Dodgers, only reason why I went. Now the parking wasn't that bad, parking is cash only. Even though it was posted on all the signs, it still took us to find out when we tried to give the parking attendant a credit card.  So after we waited in line we found a near by bank to get some cash. But decided to park our truck there instead. Walk wasn't that bad, they also have bike carriages and shuttle to get you there sooner. We entered at the center field entrance, noticed a lot of Chicago influence(as expected). I really thought it was cool that some of their advertisement wasn't local, it was actually from Chicago. This park was awesome, one of my favorite spring training parks I have visited.  Seating is great all the way around, they have the roof top seating. Trying to bring the Wrigley Field flavor, nothing wrong with that. And they have the grass seating! They have a lot going on, and a lot of food options. And BEER! This is a great park, and want to go back again.

My favorite pizza joint opened a location on the east side. Unlike its older sister, this one has its own location. You can still order from the office bar just like you do at moon doggie. I love Naked Pizza for their pizza, and this location did not disappoint me. Pizza is the best in town, my favorite over all. It takes awhile to get it, but it's worth the wait. Like I said about the moon doggie location. Very surprising how crispy the crust is even though the crust is thick. Sauce is spicy, cheese is very good, and the little pepperoni is perfect. Doesn't matter if its this place or the west location. I will continue to eat here every time we're in town.

Meeting my Aunt who was in town. I really don't know much about this area for restaurants so I yelped it! I am very hesitant of trying Mexican Restaurants since I have two favorites in the valley. So I will always compare any new place I try out, which may be a little unfair?  However, Fiesta Mexicana may not be on the same level of my two favorites. But they are very close. We had a table of seven, workers were very nice and helpful. Ordered our drinks and gave us chips and salsa very quickly. Chips were good, salsa were very good and had a nice kick. First, they have a huge menu and can become overwhelming. So I suggest you have an idea what you want to eat before looking at the menu. I had their Pollo al le Crema. Its grilled chicken with rice and beans and mushroom cream sauce. It was very good and I really enjoyed it. I know that two other people had shrimp burritos, and were very satisfied with their dish. My Aunt had the chili verde burrito and enjoyed here dish also. The other three, i'm really not sure or cared what they had. But I know there wasn't any complaints from them. Since it was Friday, they had a live Mariachi music. They were awesome and really liven up the place. The only reason why they did not get five stars were the fact they added the gratuities on the check and it was pretty darn high. I was probably going to give them more anyways. But I don't like the fact how they can assume that everything was fine enough to give them self that tip?  With that said, we will be coming back when ever we are in the area. Great place, and we now have three different spots we like in the valley!

This is not that bad of a place, this area really doesn't have to many burger joints. Besides your usual fast food franchise. I drive down McDowell a lot and never noticed this place until recently. I think this place recently opened?  Their menu really reminds me of Douglas Burgers in California, very wide selection. From your Burgers and fries to Burritos and Tacos. And everything else in between. This location was very clean and the people working there was very courteous. I was hungry, so I had a carne asada taco, and a chili burger. I was very satisfied with this. Might not be the best, but it was just fine. Their chili burger actually reminded me of Tommy's Burger, of course another Cali's burger shack.   Overall I was very satisfied, and will come back from time to time.

Rudys is a great West Valley addition. It's nice to see an establishment like this open up. It's still a little drive for me, but it's worth it.   I like Rudys because its different, It's not your usual BBQ restaurants. You walk in and immediately you have a host or hostess to help you. If it's your first time there it can be confusing. Their breakfast tacos are already in the heater ready to go. You have self serve choice to make before you can get to the counter and place your order. Now they sell their meat by the pound, I had their pork ribs, potato salad, and had to try their brisket breakfast taco. Surprisingly the taco was very good, wasn't sure if it was going to be since it had a combination of eggs, cheese, and brisket. But then again whats in a machaca burrito? And they taste great! The ribs were a dry rub, and you add the BBQ sauce at your table. Without the sauce it was pretty decent, and the added sauce made it that much better. Ribs had a lot of meat so they are not cheating you on anything.   I had a great time here, friendly service, received my food very quickly, and the food was good. The atmosphere was really cool also!  This is definitely a place I would like to visit occasionally.

Very, very surprised! Been driving by this place for a while now. Have been hesitant to try it. So on our way back from our foster kids therapy. We decided to stop by on our way home. I had the carne asada soft tacos. First they are large, and very good. I also had a bite of Natalies chile verde burrito. I liked it because it also had beans in it. All five kids really enjoyed their dinner. Wife had the cheese enchiladas, and said it was worth coming back for.  The only down side at this place is their decor is worn and dated. Needs to be updated. But this place is well worth it. Glad we tried it, and will continue to come back.

Another new business in Surprise!!   Tropical Cafe offers smoothies, sandwiches, wraps, tacos, and salads. Great selection if you want options besides burgers, and pizza. Reminds me of Subway, except has a tropical influence.   I had the Korean BBQ tacos, I really enjoyed this. The tacos are in a soft flour tortilla, filled with vegetables, lettuce, and your choice of steak or chicken.   Wife had the chipotle chicken wrap, this comes with vegetables, lettuce, rice, and chicken. Had a couple of bites on this and it was very good.  Smoothies are really good also, I had the strawberry and banana smoothie, while the wife had the pineapple, orange and banana. TIP!! Hers was a lot better!!  Glad they opened this place up, it's in the same square as uptown alley, and Digiplex theater. Always nice to have something new to choose from, and I will diffidently come by more often.

Been here before and wasn't that impressed, Didn't think it was worth spending the time to write a review. However we were looking for some table benches for a table we recently purchased else where. We went to Ashley, we have purchased thousands of dollars worth of furniture from them in the past six years. And we found some benches that would be perfect. Only problem was they were not available until april. Bummer! Going home wife suggested we stop by American Furniture, so we did. So we started looking around, lo and behold there it was. The exact same benches, even said it was a Ashley brand. Not only did they stock it, it was $100.00 cheaper then Ashley. I asked the salesmen how was it possible that American Furniture can sale a Ashley product then Ashley themselves? Because they buy in such a bulk and cash, they are given a very good price. So now this was worth writing about.  I do love about how they dont have the salesperson at the front door hounding you. They have a huge warehouse full of product. Love how you purchase something, you dont have to drive some place else to pick up your product. They have there! Price are great here. I now like this place, and will purchase our future furniture here.

Pretty neat place, had some time. Had french toast for breakfast. It was great! Very thick, so it's going be very filling. It has a little gift store inside, reminds me of Crocker Barrel. Need to come back and try other things.

We have yet been disappointing with either Haymakers location. We have been to this Goodyear location on a few occasions now. And every time it has been a great experience. Service has been great, ambiance has been good, and the food has been amazing. I really enjoy their chili, burger is good, fried chicken is great, anything we have ordered has been very good. This place is becoming a favorite if ours and we will continue to try something different during our future visits.

Only time we cone here is when we are eating dinner at Lucky's next door and if the kids are behaving? We come here for the thrifty ice cream!! Grew up on the ice cream and still remains our favorite! Prices are reasonable, and they also sale filtered water. Very convient for us and will continue to come by only if the kids behave! (yea right)

Just one of those things. How I ended up here, it just ended up that way? It was early, was more hungry then usual. Didn't have time to get a bowl of cereal at home. So on my way to work I was deciding whether I should stop somewhere to grab a bite or just get to work. The closer I got to work the more I was talking myself into grabbing something to eat. So, I seen this little place. Had a 24/7 sign lit up. AT 6:00 AM, there isn't many choices to grab something.  So I pulled into the drive through. I really wasn't that impressed with the breakfast burrito selection. They only had three? Machaca, Bacon and Eggs, and Chorizo. I was going to order the Machaca, but I was more in the mood for Chili Verde. So I asked if I can order off the menu, I asked if they can make me a Chili Verde and Egg burrito?  Note: When I was a little hombre and visited my grandparents in Arizona. Grandma fed us chili verde all the time. Growing up in the years, chili verde was my favorite meal and to this day it still is. Now back to the review! So after asking them for the request, they said no problem. And of course I added my 6:00 AM diet coke with the meal.  First, the burrito is a very decent size. I took the meal to my office. They wrap the burrito in a foil so it was still very hot when I started eating it. Kind of funny, their chili verde actually reminded me of how my grandmother use to make hers! It was very good. Had a nice kick, was to soggy, and had plenty of pork. I like two kind of chili verde. My mothers, which is more mild but explodes with flavor. And my Grandmothers, which has a nice kick but still have enough flavor.  I was diffidently surprised by this place. Did not expect how good their chili verde was. They were very nice to allow me to order off the menu. Very gracious about this and will come back to dine in at a later day.

Had a great time. Met up with my mother and aunt at West Gate. Was walking and noticed this new food joint. Never had crayfish before so I wanted to try it out. Service was great and willing to answer any questions. Since I was a virgin, they showed me how to crack open the shell, pull the meat, and suck the head. It was good, but way to much work. We also ordered their sausage. It was awesome, really made the visit worthwhile. Added some of their great bread. Had a great time, don't like how you have to work so much just for a little meat. But the sausage and bread was worth it.

Never had a reason to come here. However we had some gift certificates to use and we took the whole clan on Easter. Happy we ended up coming here. Loved the recliners especially the kids. Popcorn was actually very good. Employees were very nice, and the prices are very reasonable. My favorite movie theater is Ipics, but thus place is now a close third. Definitely will be back.

#900 Review# Wife and I decided to take our foster kids out to Wickenburg for their last day with us. Knew a few restaurant that were really good. But sadly to say when we got their, they were all closed down! So I noticed Ike's. Parking and entrance was in the rear of the building. When we entered, there is a sign that tells you to go left. Just follow the hallway and you will get to the dining room.  We ordered: Bowl of chili Three kids cheese burger Pulled pork Garlic fries Three single scoop of vanilla ice cream Slice of cherry pie  Kids enjoyed their burgers, wife likes her pulled pork. I took a bite and it was really good. My bowl of chili was ok, it was almost like a bowl of pinto beans. However the overall experience was enjoyable. As long the kids and wife enjoyed it.

I go here a lot since I use American Airline most of the time. There have been construction going here lately so it has been a mess. Plenty of restaurants, and stores. Of course they are expensive. Why do you think they make you throw away your 99 cents bottle water at TSA, Then you buy a $3.00 dollar bottle water inside? Big business! Anyway, this terminal is fine.

A big plus for Surprise. Other then Dunkin Donuts and store bought. There isn't much choices out here for donuts. Well on Friday I took the kids there for a donut. Was surprised by the selection even for late morning. Their fancy donuts are huge. The donuts are very good, I still like the Donut shop on Grand Ave. However this is a great place. The workers are really nice, not a lot of seating inside, but there is seating outside. Well worth your visit, prices are very reasonable.

When I get a chance to eat hear, I'll upgrade the review. However I have been here twice and both times it has been closed. Even though the sign said it should be open?  We'll see where it takes me, hopefully I will find this place open eventually?

FINALLY!! Our third try, we were able to experience Daniel's food. When we got there, they looked pretty stressed. The female was complaining how bad of a day it was and how busy it has been. I replied "Well, that's a good thing then. You never want to be slow." I ordered the carne asada burrito. Wife had the two ground beef tacos. They were worried we might get upset because we would have to wait for about thirty minutes. Some people might get upset, we don't. We understand if you want fresh cooked food, it will take some time. Even when it might take a few minutes more. They offered us a free soda.  1st) Very nice people, There was the cook, and young man, and the female cashier. Beside the females slightly being negative. They were all very nice.  2nd) My burrito was worth trying! Glad we kept on coming back so we can try their food. Wife loved her taco's.  3rd) The facility was very clean, I like how the kitchen is in the open and you can see them cook your food. They have nothing to hide from us!! We did not stay to eat there, however there are plenty of room.  We will diffidently come back often, and try other items on the menu.  Two reasons why I did not give a five star! 1) Chips were not the best, A little soggy, and greasy.  2) The female cashier, I truly understand there are bad days. I honestly know when you are running out of things, you had a long day, you tend to be negative. Nothing against her! She was very nice. Hopefully you will realize the most important thing about running a place like this is be happy to see your customers.

Been to a Texas Roadhouse a few times, but this was my first at this location. This location recently opened. Took me a bit to stop by since the waiting is obscene. New business in town, plenty of people are going to try this place out. However, I did find out is this place takes reservations. I will highly advise you to do this.  I was happy this place opened up, I love BBQ, and they have BBQ, So I decided to order their Grilled chicken salad!! Have to come back again to try the ribs! The salad was great. Comes with bacon, eggs, crouton, and carrots. Chicken is delicious. Serving is huge, you can actually share it with someone if needed. So I ate the whole thing by myself! They make a big deal about their bread. Its good, but I think its funny when they seat you, they tell you we are going to grab your freshly baked bread for you. Just bread, its good, but just bread.  Our server was great, good looking, funny, and made sure the wife and I were fine. Loved how they are supporting the local spring training teams. Have Royals and Rangers pictures up. Not a fan of these team but like how they showed local support. Overall we had a great time, food was great, service was great, price are reasonable. Going to come back again.

Lou's in the valley!!  Since I am in Chicago about five times a year, I have gotten to know Lou pretty good. Daughter recommended them when I am in the area. Now I live in the west valley, been trying to find a good pizza joint since we moved here from SoCal about six years ago. We have a couple of places that are good, however nothing to brag about. Since I work in Phoenix, Lou's is pretty close to me. So it works out! I decided to order carry out. Place looks awesome, they have a huge outdoor area. And the pizza? Taste as good if I bought it from Chicago! Love their deep dish butter crust! The ripen tomatoes add a great flavor. Glad they chose to have their water filtered the way it is in Chicago. Don't think the Phoenix water would have worked out. They went the distance to make this work here, and I hope it works out.

The controversial Casino! If you haven't heard about this casino. Either you are new to the area, or don't listen to the news. After all of these years, it's finally here. Might be in a temporary building, but it's here. Well kind of!  It is a building, going to build a much larger resort as soon all the red tape has been jumped over or paid off? So as of now, no liquor license and I do believe they have only a level two casino license. Not sure exactly that means, but they are not a fully licensed casino yet. Still battling in court and everyone else.  Once this place is in place it will be a great business opportunity for the area. Allows the spring training travelers to have another option of entertainment in the west valley, also anyone going to the games nearby should be entertained by this. Plenty of slots, free soda machines at two locations since there is no liquor. There is a food court which is not bad. Not a lot of tables since they are not licensed for some games. Remember! This is only temporary, it will get better in time. Wife and I had a great time, don't need the liquor since we don't drink that much. Wished they had a non-smoking section, again that will come in the new and much larger casino in the future. This is a great added addition of entertainment for the west valley.

Pretty cool place, Was in the area, on our way home. Wanted to stop for lunch before wife had to work. Yelped the area for a burger joint and Sammy's comes up. I ordered the pastrami burger, wife had her cheeseburger. We also shared a strawberry shake.  First of all I have to say the shake was awesome. Probably the best part of the meal. The pastrami burger was OK. The reason why it was just OK. It was my first Pastrami burger. Wasn't sure how thus was going to be? Next time I will try the green chili burger. Wife thought her cheeseburger was really good. Fries came out super hot and crispy. Have no complaints for this establishment. If in the area again, we will have to stop by again. Service was super fast, and the workers were really nice. GREAT PLACE!

This is my third review for this location, When it was Ultra Star, this place was awesome. It was always clean, customer service was great and it was very affordable. When Digiplex purchased them, it really went down hill! Prices went up, service really suffered, and the appearance took a hit. Very dirty. Now Carmike is the new company, and we have been there a couple of times since the new ownership. It has vastly improved, it's a lot cleaner, customer service has stepped up. Prices are the same, however they do have more specials. Hopefully this place will make a nice comeback?

Had to try this place. The previous business at this location was horrendous. The new business seems to be just fine. Very clean, staff seems to be on their game. Food was good. Yes, it's another sports bar. Seems that's all we have is Surprise. Pretzels were good, and their cheeseburger were excellent. Nothing to complain about.
