I do not like H&R Block, but I give lots of credit to the manager Rose. One she called me back, two she was honest with me, three she found my file when nobody seem to know where it was. I even told this guy one time where it was and he could not find it (load of crap) he just wanted to do it himself and receive all the pay.  If I go back to H&R Block the manager Rose (51st ave & Peoria)  and Lynda T. (35the ave & Thunderbird) are the only because they are straight up with people and that makes life a lot better

They really need to have someone who answers the phones who understands and speaks the English language better. Having to repeat myself 3 & 4 times is not cool. I told what I needed.

Store is a mess. They need to clean a little more. The fountain drink had been down for 3 days. It seems that corporate does not care. They should get that fixed fast because they sell a lot of fountain drinks here in the valley

Ordering dinner for my kids and the cashier gave my food to the wrong person and you want $15 hour (are you crazy).  This place is dirty and the staff needs training on customer service. Now I see why I hate coming here.

No one around to help.  Not a place that I like to shop. I do not feel like anyone cares when you go in there. If I wanted to be treated like that I can go to Walmart. If it is my choice I will never shop there again

When I asked a employee for help with shoes he tried to run off and not help me. If you are busy just say so I will not get offended by that. Just tell me so.

The store is always messy. In our area has a high rate of crime. Walmart needs to take a more proactive approach when dealing with the crime and the mess. Also have more people work the return desk

I talked to Evan just a few minutes over the phone at Papa Johns after one of his people hung up on me. He handled my call with promptly and fixed the problem. If it was not for Evan at this location I would NEVER order pizza from Papa Johns. He is a good manager

The products are always great but when you go to check out the lines are always long and it takes them a long time to ask for help. When I checked out the cashier was on the phone and not talking to me and that really pissed me off. Tell whoever your talking to you have customers and you will call them back and they will have to get over it.

To much money to get in. They charge $5 for adults and $1 for players. The food in ok. The fields are not that taken care of.  The one thing that makes me mad they hassle me about being in water.  I really hate this place, but this was where the club baseball tournament was today.

Duo the store manager Lauren went the extra mile for my family and I. My son was trying on UnderArmour sunglasses and they did not have to pair that he liked so we ordered them online and she go Mr free shipping. He helped my son and he was so happy. I will keep going there because of her.

This is the 2nd review about the bathrooms. The men's bathroom is dirty. Urine stains on the floor and the urinals. I spend a lot of time driving around the valley and this is the worst kept bathrooms. I will never stop at this QT again.  QT are known for clean stores. This store missed the meno. Even the parking lot has oil spills everywhere. I guess this store manager does not care because you are a reflection of your leadership. If I wanted to go to a dirty store and get lousy customer service I would go to Circle K

Just used Anytime Auto Glass again. I have had my windshield replaced 3 times with them and ever time the work has been great. I always speak to Lenny and his customer service is great and he will walk through the whole process. I will always use Anytime Auto Glass because they use factory glass and not after market crap
