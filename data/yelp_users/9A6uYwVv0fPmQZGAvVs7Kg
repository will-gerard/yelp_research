The food is good but every single time we place phone orders my burrito is fucked up! Done with this place!

It's McDonald's so you can't really expect the best the best. But this has by far been the worse McDonald's I have ever been to. For as long as it took to get a McDouble after ordering I could have gone to a sit down restaurant order and probably get my food way quicker. I always try to understand the situations that happen in Restaurants because I myself at one point in my life worked at McDonald's but this was the worse experience. They had a bunch of employees working but yet no one was working. I spotted employees eating behind the counter even a manager took some French fries and put them in her mouth as she passed the lines of people waiting for food and to have their order taken. All those kids working there need to be fired and replaced with people that actually want to work. Yeah working at McDonald's isn't the best job but if that's what you applied for and then do your damn job!! Never will I ever go back to this specific McDonald's again. This was not the first bad experience here but this was by far the worse one that it made me want to write a bad review. Whoever owns this McDonald's needs to really get their staff in check!!!

Today was my first time there and Sharon did a great job. Although it did feel a bit rushed I didn't mind being in and out fast as long as they did the job correctly. I did end up getting a membership that now I'm kinda thinking I shouldn't of have. But we will see how the rest of my visits go. As long as they continue with the excellent service there will not be any issues.

Tried to get a haircut here and I sat waiting for 30 minutes and wasn't helped. The guy I thought I was waiting for suddenly got up and left. Said "I dunno who's gonna cut his hair but I have somewhere to be". Won't be coming back

I just started coming here recently. I figured this was like filibertos and didn't really care for it. I decided to come one night and received great customer service and the food has been great every time.

Usually I go here and pick up lunch for everyone at work. I have never had a problem till today. The new lady at the register was extremely rude! I said I was paying separate and she said in a very stern and angry voice "NO! YOU CANT DO THAT WITH PHONE ORDERS!" Which I don't understand why not  since the food doesn't even get made until you get here to pick it up! Last time I come here! I'm all about customer service and this "new" person ruined this place for me!
