This is one of my favorite places to eat. Better than some of my other favorites like pei Wei and Panda Express. It's well worth the drive even though I'm more on the west side. Service is fast and friendly and the food is consistent. I love the pineapple Hawaiian chicken and the orange chicken with crispy spinach is awesome! Also enough the coconut shrimp appetizer. The shrimp is large and the portion is generous! Also happy hour is a blast! Love the Martini I ordered.

I love this bank! They are like family at this point and I have cancelled my Chase bank account. I do ally banking at this location and they know me by name. You can't get that kind of service at the larger banks.

Clean, Fast, and Friendly! The store is clean and the employees are very helpful. It's nice to be approached at least once and asked if I need any help. This is my neighborhood store and I enjoy shopping in this store. The lines are short and if they're long they aren't for long. It's nice to see employees jumping on quickly to help. They value you're time at this store. Thanks!

Amsterdam but not as cool. Hate when a place tries desperately to be something it's not. I've went twice and the bartenders are rude and unfriendly. It's not the price of the drinks that's unattractive. It's that they're overpriced! The price for what you get isn't worth it.
