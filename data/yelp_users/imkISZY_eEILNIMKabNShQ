I have been going to Salon Surreal for almost 10 years.  Ann Dellisanti is the best of the best.  I am not always the easiest client to work with, I change it up all the time, and she never loses patience with me. She always wants to make sure I am happy.  I have recommended many friends to her over they years and they always go back too.

We were first referred to Joel at Rodiguez Auto Body a few years ago from our auto mechanic.  We needed body work done.  Since then we have been back several times (unfortunately) and each time Joel and his crew did an amazing job on my Lexus RX350.   He is a great guy and does the job well.  No fancy shop, no fancy prices,  just a honest guy running a professional business.

My husband and I are huge Jim Jeffries' fans.  I went online to buy tickets about 3 or 4 weeks before the show.  At that time, there were hardly any seats left - so we picked Section 202 and had to have seats in the second to last row.   First of all, it was strange that there were so many empty seats up front and near us during the show - I guess they save for high rollers?  The fact that all of the seats are the same level didn't help - because I am short and anyone taller than me took away my view.  The chairs themselves were nothing more than padded folding chairs.   We could hardly hear Jim between the low level of his mic and the bartenders and customers ordering drinks.  It was terribly distracting.  All of the people we sat near said they would never go to Ovations at Wild Horse Pass and Casino again.  I don't understand why they would allow drinks to be served INSIDE THE VENUE where you're trying to hear the show.  What a waste of money.  We were really looking forward to seeing this show too.

The only thing good about this place is the location and the interior.  The service was horrible and the staff didn't seem to know what was going on.  Maybe there were new employees?  In any case, don't order a thin pizza here and expect to get a thin pizza.  Their thin pizza is like a regular normal crust.  The Kona pizza was terrible.

Obviously this place caters to a night crowd....  I met up with  9 other girlfriends on a recent Sunday afternoon.  When I made the reservations, I told them we wanted to sit outside if it was nice - it not, we would sit inside.  The man I talked to on the phone assured me we would be able to have a nice conversation at the table and not have to shout at each other.    When we got there, Marcus, the hostess, said he had room for us all inside. Well, that was pretty evident by the fact that there was only one other table occupied.  Since it hadn't begun to rain yet (but it had rained prior that morning), I asked if we could sit outside.  Marcus said he didn't have anything to wipe the wet tables off with, only napkins....I asked him if he couldn't get any bar towels?  He looked at me as if I was speaking a foreign language.  So, needless to say, Marcus didn't want to go out of his way to accommodate us outside.    In the end, it was a good thing that we didn't end up outside because as the day progressed, it got pretty windy and rainy...  After we were all seated, it took over 10 minutes for the waitress to offer us water or take our drink order.  Then, once she took our drink order, only two of the drinks were delivered!  5-10 minutes later, we all had drinks - but remember, there was only one other table with people at it! Not once during the whole two hours we were there, were any of us asked for a refill for our drinks  The good news is that once the food was delivered, everyone was pleased with their order. However, the menu could probably use some sprucing up with some more appealing descriptions.  Things like french toast - plain - no special bread or toppings...I could make that at home and they charge 8$.    When we got there, one of my friends went to the restroom.  She said there was no soap and let the waitress know.  An hour and a half later, still no soap in the ladies room.  What the heck!!????  How do the employees wash their hands?  We had to use the soap in the men's room.  Apparently we were told, they didn't get their shipment in.  So, can't someone run to the grocery store and buy some for a dollar just this one time???  When we were ready to leave, there was finally soap in the women's restroom.  I tried to catch the bartenders eyes several times.  I did not see him smile once.  I did talk to him at the very end of our visit there and expressed our disappointment with some of the things.  His name is Nate.  He said they had to have someone go next door to Dos Gringos to borrow the soap.  I got the impression he wasn't too thrilled with the fact that we had made such a big issue out of it.    The other thing that made us a bit uncomfortable was the fact the as the day got colder, they couldn't shut the garage doors because there was another party sitting outside under the cover of a patio.  So, there's no other door for the waitress to get outside?  Because we were the only ones there (one guy on his computer at the bar), it was nice and we were able to linger and talk for almost two hours. But again, no offer of refills for our drinks or were asked if we wanted dessert or anything.  They probably wanted to get rid of us!  Pro - good food.  Con - bad service

I got the name of this groomer from a friend of mine and soooooo glad I did.  Deon and Mitch are both dog-loving people and it's very evident by the way they loved on all three of my dogs.  Deon is a fantastic groomer and I would highly recommend them to anyone!

Uggg.   I was so excited for this place to open a location in the East Valley because I had been hearing about their fabulous mac and cheese.  I ordered the Budda's Delight mac and cheese and told the waitress to have chef make it al dente and she said no problem.  When my dish arrived, not only was the mac and cheese OVER COOKED, but it was swimming in a tasteless cheese sauce that looked like cheese whiz.  I ordered some truffle oil to see if that would help and it didn't.  Next time I want mac and cheese, I will get the Annie's brand in the box.
