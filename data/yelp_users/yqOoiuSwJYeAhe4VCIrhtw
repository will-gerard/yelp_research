I found this place through Yelp. Had great reviews, so decided to take my vehicle there to have my brakes checked. There's a reason they have great reviews, they are all well deserved! They didn't try to sale me more services than what I needed, were extremely honest about what needed to be done. I paid half the cost of what I have paid in the past to replace my brakes. You won't be disappointed! Super honest and reliable staff!

Horrible service!! I had been to this restaurant once before and the food was good so decided to come back for a date night with my boyfriend. When we arrived the place was pretty empty but it seemed like they were preparing for an event. The host found a table for us, we sat down and waited about 20 minutes for the waiter to take our order. A full hour went by and we never got our food after we inquired a couple of times!!! We were both starving, so we ended up leaving after we wasted 1.5 hrs there!  Pretty disappointed about the lack of customer service!!!
