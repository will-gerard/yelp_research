There's nothing like a good brunch and the brunch here is more than good.  Do yourself a favor if you live in town and sell some plasma at least once a year to come enjoy refueling your body with the delicious spread of the Mansion.  Between the view, the bottomless mimosas, the pancake bar, the seafood spread, and the elegant setting you're bound to have a fantastic Sunday.    All of the food we sampled (which if I'm being honest was enough to overflow the bed of an F150) was of high quality and very good.  The seafood was especially great.  They had crab legs, oysters, clams, mussels, and shrimp to add to the ocean of champagne in your stomach.    At $49/pp it's on the high end of the brunch budget but it is worth it to treat yo self or impress some out of town visitors.  If it's your first visit make sure to fill up your mimosa and stroll through the house after your meal.  It's a historic place and you might learn something other than "how many visits to the prime rib station can I make before feeling bad about myself?"

Houston's, Hillstone...they're all the same.  What you get is delicious food, great service, a slick atmosphere, and an expensive tab.    Hillstone is the perfect business dinner or date night spot.  The bar is nice and the patio is great.  For the food you can't go wrong with anything but my go to is the French dip or the ribs.

I really like Sakana for sushi.  The happy hour roll prices are very good and overall the sushi quality is great.  It's not the nicest sushi place you'll find in the valley but for you'll be hard pressed to do better for a quick, solid, and inexpensive meal.

This is a good breakfast place.  The bagels are good, the lox is tasty, and the sandwiches are plentiful.  Service is reasonably paced and there are tables both indoors and out to enjoy your meal.

I hadn't been here in quite some time and I don't know why.  The food here is great, the prices are cheap, and the atmosphere is greatly improved since they remodeled the place.    The tamales and tacos are both excellent and I didn't get a chance to try the quesadilla but I couldn't stop staring at the one on the next table.  Taco Tuesday provides $1 street tacos on 4 different varieties (Pastor, carnitas, chicken, and marinated chicken when I was there).

I eat here pretty much weekly.  The pizzas are awesome (especially the wood fired ones) and the rest of the menu is no different.  The salads are awesome and large, the bruschetta is solid, and the tiramisu...oh, the tiramisu.  Save room for it.  The beer selection is great and if you're in the neighborhood during happy hour, make sure to stop in.  There are some great deals (1/2 off apps, cheap drinks).

One of my favorite happy hour spots.  The happy hour food menu is strong and there are drink options for everyone.  The best deal would be the $7 Sake and large Kirin.   The sushi itself, while definitely not the best in town, is decent.  I've never had anything bad or regretful here.  The atmosphere is always enjoyable and if the weather permits the patio is a great group spot (or just for general people watching).    You have a lot of choices in this area so I wouldn't go here every week but I definitely would keep it in my rotation.

Drive thru line here always moves at a snail's pace.  Inside, it moves slower.    On the inside, I can't understand the fact that to this day if you order a plain iced coffee that drink has to wait in line behind every frap that's being made.  It takes 5 seconds to pour.

I enjoy pasta night (Monday and, I believe, Tuesdays) when they have half-priced pasta dishes.  I've had the pizza and I'm not a huge fan of it but it isn't bad.  It is a very small restaurant so don't be surprised if you need to wait for a table.  On my last visit I learned you can bring your own wine for a ridiculously low corkage fee so take advantage of that if you go!

Goodness.  I can't understand what took me so long to find this place.  The sushi is remarkably good.  The rest of the food is visually stunning and delicious.  The decor is nice for the limited size of the restaurant and the service was excellent.  Pricewise you're going to spend more than your typical sushi place but when you factor in the quality you're getting a great value.     I'd recommend the gyoza for an appetizer and as much sushi as you can handle.  I look forward to coming back here multiple times to have a full sampling of the menu.

Very good food.  I'm typically not a big fan of going out for breakfast.  I prefer a quick meal and waiting around to pay $10 to eat eggs just doesn't get me excited.  The food here makes it worth the trip and the wait.  The skillets were awesome and the crepes...they looked fantastic.  I look forward to going back and taking them down!

The happy hour is great - $6 apps/drinks but the bar area is tiny and can't hold more than 15-20 people.  As a result it fills up right away.  Get there early if going for happy hour.  For the dining room the food is great.  The steaks and prime rib are great.  The prime rib special on Sundays is an especially good deal.  You get a salad, prime rib, a side, and a dessert for $39.95.

Of the national chains, Houston's is in my top-3.  The restaurant is always energetic, the food is always great, and the service I've had is always top-notch.  The really should be commended for their knowledge and consistency on that front.   The last time we were there we went with the smoked salmon appetizer (awesome and I don't usually like smoked fish), the ribs (actually not the quality I've experienced at Houston's), and the French Dip (very good) but you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu.    If you're looking for an upscale dining experience this should always be a consideration.

For happy hour:    Great value at $2/$2.50 for beers, $5 for specialty drinks, and $3-$7 apps.  The food was ample and very good.  The stuffed shrimp was great and the crab balls were very good as well.      While the bar is a little sleepy you'll have a good time if Big John, a rambunctious regular, is there.

This was my first time here and I can't help but wonder what took me so long.  It's just a great layout for a couple of drinks after work or hanging out with friends.  The beer selection is incredible.  There are 20+ solid selections on draft and then about 200 in cans/bottles found in coolers.  The staff was friendly but a little overwhelmed at times.  Happy hour knocked off a buck a beer so pints started around $4.    Best of all it has that great bar lighting that makes day-drinking perfect.  You know the light.  Dark and soft but not so dark that you squint when you walk it.  But when you walk out you're reminded your whole day is still ahead of you.    I can certainly see this being my go-to place for drinks in South Scottsdale.

Great sandwich, good price, outdoor seating is a plus as well.    I do wish I could have seen the menu prior to getting to the counter to order (it's cramped and the menu is posted on the wall behind the counter so you can't see a lot of it until you're up on the register).  Also, the outdoor seating is very tight as there are probably 3 too many tables out there.    All of the food that came out looked delicious.  I had a sandwich this time but look forward to trying the pasta next time as it looked great.    The grocery area is great and I picked up some old Italian favorites after lunch.

Obviously the reputation preceeds itself.  The restaurant earned that reputation though.  The pizza is fantastic. With their being open for lunch now and adding a second location, you can actually get one of those pizzas in less than 3 hours too, which is a bonus.    The Wiseguy and the Rosa are my favorites.   The prices are a little steep but the quality is fantastic.  As a friend of mine said: "The pizza here is awesome if you wait less than 30 minutes for a table.  If you wait for an hour, it's really good.  If you wait two hours, it's ok. If you wait 3 hours for a table it's just pizza."

This is one of my favorite places in Phoenix.  Whether you're stopping by the grocery side for a to-go sandwich and dessert or sitting in the bar and having some of their great beers on draft you'll enjoy your time here.    The pizza is incredible.  Most great pizza comes from a brick oven but not here.  They cook in pretty standard equipment but their ingredients and quailty are outstanding.  The people are always nice and the prices are reasonable.  I'd recommend valeting the car (behind the restaurant) as parking is at a premium.

Uggggh.  What a disaster.  I came here with a group of people for happy hour and the service was attrocious.  It was 15-20 minutes between server sightings.  Worse than that though was the fact that a portion of our group came here specifically so we could watch a baseball game.  They kept changing the channel from the game to another.  After we explained we were watching that, they'd change it back...until they changed it again 5 minutes later.  This literally happened 5 times until we just gave up.    The lone bright spot here is they have some pretty good beer on tap.  There were 3 New Belgium handles and some Goose Island.

Fish in the desert is a tricky proposition. You're going to pay more for quality and that's what happens up at Wildfish. It's pricey but solid food.  If you're in the area around happy hour time they do have some great apps and drinks on special.  The service was terrific.  The only thing that bothered me was how tight everything was.  If you're at the bar there is constant traffic behind you people cluttered around to order.

Great, unique food and a nice selection of beers.  There isn't much more I'd ask from a restaurant.  The ambiance is very casual and dark but it's a great place for a large group or even solo dining.  The menu is fantastic and makes you want to come back again just to try another pasty.  With a dough wrapped meat/cheese/veggie mix you'd think this would be very heavy but it isn't.  They don't overload with fats or cheeses so the meal remains balanced and tasty.  Happy hour M-Sat until 6 just adds another reason to stop by.

Fear not my fair skinned friends and come get some authentic and unique Mexican!  Obviously this place isn't winning any awards for ambiance or location but for value and food it's a pretty great lunch option.  Located in the Guadalajara Mercado on Arizona Ave, this is pretty much a spot in a mini food court surrounded by predatory cell phone companies, a western union location, and some clothing stores.  The menu is clearly laid out (in English) and ordering is fast and easy.    The signature torta is $6 and will leave you full for hours.  You have numerous other tortas and burrito options as well in the $5-$6 range.  The torta ahogada has a great roll stuffed with roasted pork which all swims in a pool of sauce at your desired spice level.  It's good but I think next time I'll sample some of the burritos.  There is a toppings bar to add pickled onions, lime, cilantro, etc.    If you're over in this area and want a good lunch for a good value then you can find it here.

The Chile Verde was very good.  Just the right amount of spice and a perfect portion size.  The meatballs were ok but the sticky toffee pudding dessert was outrageously good.  I'd come back for that alone.  The menu itself isn't that deep but I tend to like that.  The complimentary valet is nice and the restaurants décor is pretty cool.  Overall I enjoyed it and look forward to trying them again.

This certainly isn't a spot I'd go every week but for a special occassion (family visiting, etc) it's a great spot to grab breakfast or brunch.  The farm is a lovely setting.  If you haven't been there before there are a few restaurants on the property.  This one is in the far back.  I found the food to be very good (better than the other casual eatery at the front).  The ingredients are super fresh (you can see the veggies being grown next to the restaurant) and the portions were sized appropriately.    The cost is on the high side for a breakfast but again, you're paying for atmosphere as well.  Give it a go but expect a long wait on weekends.

I'm not one to sit up on a pedestal and tell you to eat organic.  Honestly, I don't care if there were some high powered fertilizers used to grow my tomatoes if they're fresh.  And that's exactly what you'll get here - fresh.  They harvest their veggies from the large garden out back which you're free to walk through before or after your meal.  The food is varied and there is something for everyone.  The salads are large, the sandwiches are filling, and the sides are all very good.  The only downside of Joe's is the price.  You'll probably be looking at $30 for lunch for 2 especially if you choose to have dessert or a shake (you should have a shake).  All told it is a fantastic lunch option and a great place to take out-of-town visitors, especially in the cooler months!

Parking was -35 stars but only because there was a Giants game on the day I went.  Do yourself a favor and head to the big lot at 75th and Main st. and pay the $5 to park.  It's a short walk to the door from there.  That aside, I really had a good time here.  There were tons of vendors from every medium of art, live music, good food trucks, and reasonably priced beverages to enjoy the perfect Arizona weather.  I feel like this event will be on the annual social calendar going forward.

I live about a half mile away from here. During the two years I've lived in this close proximity, I never went inside until a couple of weeks ago.  I don't know why that is but I guess it has something to do with its very odd location and the fact that there really isn't any other reason for me to be in that plaza.  I decided to stop in for Wing night (Thursdays - $0.40 wings) and watch a hockey game and I'm glad I did.  It's a very good sports bar with great specials, tons of TVs, a bunch of outdoor seating, pool tables, etc.  The happy hour specials are very good (half priced apps and cheap drinks) and the food that I've tried in my two visits has been good.  The music can get very loud around the bar but, hey, you're at a bar.    If you're familar with the area it reminds me of a better organized Public House Garage or a cleaner CKs.

Fleming's is always a good choice for a celebratory dinner, a date, or just a really good happy hour.  The happy hour goes  until 7 and they have $6 apps and drinks.  It is definitely one of the better deals in town.  You can go next door to Z'Tejas for cheaper food or drinks but this is soooo much better.  The only downside is the bar seats maybe 30 people and is always packed during HH.    If you're sitting down for a full dinner hopefully you're there on a Sunday night.  They have a prime rib special that includes a salad, side, and dessert.  This is a very good deal if you can get it.  Otherwise the steaks are all done nicely and I can't recall having anything off the menu that I've disliked.

Large pub with a good selection of beers.  They have a huge list of rotating cask ales which was nice.  The food was very good as well.  We had a fish pie for 2 that hit the spot.  Not cheap but not expensive considering the part of town.  The service was fantastic here as well.

I can certainly see where the food has potential as one of the entrees (the ox shin) was very good.  One of the entrees (the mushroom/lentil pie) tasted bland and a bit like cardboard.  They charge for bread (that's just cheap) and they overcharged for the wine we ordered as well.  The manager/server(?) gentleman had an attitude about him that gave the impression that he didn't care.    So what that boils down to is about half the food was good, the service and prices were off.  Use that information as you wish.

Service was average at best.  The food was medicore to good.  The short rib was great, the sides were not.  The crab dip was good, the bread was not.  The chicken was bad, the sides were good.  You see where I'm going with this...  The value is tremendously bad.  I know it's a hotel but you can't price the average food as 5-star gourmet.  I utilized a deal that was aimed at drawing locals to the hotel.  I had a decent meal but I certainly wouldn't go back.

Great spot for breakfast.  Even on a busy Sunday morning the wait was only about 10 minutes and they move things along quickly.  It probably took 10 minutes from the time we sat down until we were eating.  The food was big in portions and tasty.  The 222 was a great breakfast and the skillets look tasty.  I especially enjoyed the pancakes.  I had the granola and berries version and that came with a large serving of strawberries, blueberries and whipped cream.    If you're out and about and looking for a good hearty breakfast...here you go!

I love DD.  I hate this DD.  They're always terribly slow and they run out of something different everyday.  When my wife and I go through this drive thru we jokingly come up with our order and then our backup order while we wait.  More often than not we have to invoke the backup order because they've run out of something common like bagels, plain donuts, or cups.  It's a joke.  Also, I've waited in the drive thru for upwards of 25 minutes before because the staff is slow.  I've also received the wrong food on occassion.  If it wasn't for it's proximity to my workplace I'd never come here.

As far as sports bars go, this is a very good one. The food is good, fresh, and made by people (not defrosted and reheated like many sports bars). The service is friendly and there are TVs everywhere. It's a little pricier than you'd expect but worth it for the quality you receive.

There is a lot to consider with this place. Chief among those things is the location.  There isn't a lot to choose from in our neck of the woods.   To be fair that's why this location stands out.  The recent renovation was tremendous too.  The bar is now something worth hanging out at, the views of the tvs from the tables are worth seeing a game from, and the drink specials are pretty solid.  There's always a good deal on tap and happy hour runs from 3-7 and again late at night.  The last couple of friday nights I've found this place with a pretty good crowd which is a nice out this way.  The food is typical bar food so there isn't much to look for there.  The wings are kind of small so I'd skip them.  All told, a good place to grab a drink and catch a game.

Great beers.  Especially on Wednesday's when they're $3.  TVs showing all of the games are visible from nearly everywhere, there's a decent patio, and the food is good.  I should clarify,...the food is good for bar food.  There are food specials every day and a friendly staff so, yay, I'm a fan.

If you need your dryer vent cleaned (and I can't imagine you'd be on Yelp reading this if you didn't) stop now and call Matt at Northstar.    The work ethic this man had was inspiring and he charges a ridiculously fair price for the work he's doing.  Let me tell you my experience:  I called Matt and he told me he'd try to get by that night because the rest of his schedule wasn't going to work for me.  When he couldn't make it, he called and apologized profusely before agreeing to squeeze me in the next day even though he'd have to go WAAYYYY out of the way (Litchfield Park to me in Ahwatukee).  He showed up and got to work.  It turns out my house has the world's worst setup for a dryer vent.  After several hours it was very late and he was unable to crack the clog.  He refused to take my money even though he spent almost 4 hours working.  He told me what I needed to do in order to find the clog.  The next day, he came back out and we were able to get the gunk cleared.   He loves what he does, he cares about your safey, he's a small business owner, and he will be easy to deal with.  This is the type of guy/business I love to support.

My wife likes this place and that's why I've been several times. Since I can't complain to her I'll complain to you! Each time I come here I hope maybe this is the time the food wows me. Spoiler: it doesn't. Every meal I've had here is wildly mediocre. The desserts are good.  I was really quite upset on my last attempt though.  Usually I order breakfast/brunch items but seeing as I've had no luck with those I opted for a simple sandwich. Something basic so I would at least not have a bad lunch. I went for the tuna melt figuring even if they opened a can of tuna, mixed in a scoop of mayo, put it on toast, melted some cheese and charged me $9 it'd still be good. Oh, how I wish they just did that. It was, quite honestly, disgusting. The tuna, what I could taste, seemed to be chunk light and had a cornucopia of items mixed in. This included fruit. Fruit in my tuna salad. There were so many things mixed in I could barely taste the tuna OR cheese. The bread it was on was good. I should've just ordered toast. Additionally, while the fries are made in house they are not good either. Clearly they're not blanched because they're soggy and had no seasoning. Lastly, as you've read in many of these other reviews the service is pretty shoddy.   It is a cute restaurant with all the signs that it'll be good but be warned; looks can be deceiving.

You can come here for a couple of reasons.  The first would be for a quality meal which is a good enough reason.  The pretzels and fondue are one of my favorite apps anywhere.  For dinner the pasta was fresh and delicious and I'd definitely order it again.  The sandwiches/burgers aren't that special and the fried chicken is pretty bland.    The other reason you'd come here would be to get drunk.  Great place to do so.  On a budget?  No problem, order 5 brown bag specials and you'll be feeling great for under $10...that is until the hangover from 5 Old Milwaukees or Icehouses you just drank kicks in.

The food is quite good but this review is based on myself going solo.  I was able to walk in and sit at the counter, order, and eat within 25 minutes.  Had it been more than myself I'd have waited 2 hours and probably have gone elsewhere.  The portions are enormous and you should be splitting with at least one other person.  Overall though, a must stop when in Vegas.

I mean, it's probably the best $15 quesadilla you'll get in town.  If that's not your thing you can probably score a $14 salad.  But if you're really feeling froggy, try the $13 half soup and terrible sandwich!

After a full day of drinking and somehow forgetting to eat, Du-Par's saved me by being open 24/7.  Shrimp cocktail, salad, sandwich, fries, and blueberry pie for about $20?  Sure...let's do that.  $3.99 shrimp cocktail is a throwback to the Vegas of old and a must order if you're here.

Annually this is one of my favorite weekends of the year.  The two-day general admission ticket ran about $160/pp this year which, while expensive, is very worth it.  Between the awesome food, the seemingly never-ending pours of wine and beer, and the always changing amenities this is the best food festival in Phoenix.   The crowds this year made it a lot tighter than years past.  I'm not sure if that's from more media credentials, more tickets sold, or the fact that every line seemed to be 40% volunteers/employees who were on break.  As a paying guest, this is pretty annoying.  An additional area of improvement can be with organizing those lines.  Between people blending lines together and not moving once they get their food, it gets confusing if two popular spots are next to each other.    The restaurants all do a great job in presenting their dishes and it's great to get to try lots of new places.  Phoenix represents itself well here and if you like eating and drinking in a beautiful setting...this is a splurge worth doing.

Burgers are great.  I especially enjoyed the Ringer with Frank's hot sauce, bacon, and onion rings.  The fries are good and large enough to share.  The milkshake we had was too thick.  It was a bit like trying to sip a golf ball through a straw.  Prices are steep for a burger and fries but the food is top quality.  If you know you're having a burger, might as well make sure it's awesome.    The bar has a few really good beers on tap and a decent happy hour.  I'd find myself here for lunch quite a bit if I worked nearby.  Luckily (for my pants), I do not.

Review is for Sunday brunch.  The selection is solid, the price is ok ($33+tax pp), and, fittingly, the food is a gamble.  There are some winners and losers on any buffet but I felt like this one had a lot of losers.    Going around the loop, you first see soup and smoked fish (scallops, salmon, mussels).  These were terrible.  Whoever cooked those should be removed from the kitchen and put on maintenance duty where they'll be better suited.  There are numerous salad selections and the mozzeralla on the Caprese salad was about the same consistency as a hockey puck.  The carving area had a few nice choices but unfortunately they were all of poor quality.  The prime rib was very undercooked and full of grizzle, the pork loin was ok but overcooked, and the fresh cut bacon was cold rubber.  You could ask them to grill it up after cutting it but I think hot food is a must have from the buffet.    The Asian selection was actually pretty good.  The shumai were good and the rest of the selections were better than average.  The seafood is right next to this which is the other somewhat bright spot (so you should probably spend your whole time in this corner).  Regarding the seafood, the shrimp were decent but the lobster claws tasted as if they'd been frozen since the Eisenhower administration.  The crab legs, while also clearly frozen since the dawn of time, were of much better quality.  I'd recommend soaking the crab meat in drawn butter to rehydrate and heat it.    Desserts are abundant and, again, hit or miss.  The mini creme brulee was basically a war crime while the mini tiramisu was delicious.  For drinks, the included champagne is cheap but does the trick.    Some to like...so much to dislike.  A decent brunch but if you're going to spend about $40/pp after tip you might as well splurge and go somewhere high end like the Wrigley Mansion.

Good coffee.  Good scones (not life-changing as other reviews would have you believe).  The prices are reasonable.  You're looking at 3.80 for a takeaway coffee and a scone (a pound more if you stay).

I've been here numerous times and I always leave satisfied.  I've been for breakfast, brunch, a Yelp event, and just takeout.  Every time I get a ton of value and great food.    Wednesday's are an especially good day for value if you want to hook up the office with bagels.  They do 18 for the price of 12.  Throw in a half pound of cream cheese and you're taking care of a lot of people on the cheap!    Regarding the food...everything is good.  I love the bagels, the smoked salmon, the pastrami is killer, and the sliders are awesome.    The wait can be long because of all these things.  If you're showing up at 10am on Saturday don't expect a table in 5 minutes.  Prepare to wait but you'll be glad you did.

It'd been a while since I'd been here and I was pleased with my return.  I came during happy hour (4-7p) and had several of the $5 apps.  The Stack and the carne adovada quesadilla were great.  The service was good and I look forward to coming back.

I've lived in Ahwatukee for 5 years and finally got around to visiting Biscuits.  I'm glad I did.  The portions are ample, the service was fast, the food is tasty, and the prices are reasonable.   The pancakes stood out for me the most.  The biscuits (naturally) are delicious and the gravy was also delicious.    This is a very good stop for breakfast and I look forward to coming back after a long hike once the weather cools off!

Do what you do and stop trying to be gimmicky/cute.  That's the only advice I'd have for CPH.  They certainly don't need any advice on decor, food preparation, or service because all were stellar. The wine list and beer selections were very good and the menu itself is drool-inducing.  Here is what I mean though...it's called a "Public House" but it's a very sleek and upscale restaurant. It's not a pub and I get that but that sort of "we're being cool" irony bleeds over into the menu, the food, and the experience.    Another example, happy hour isn't happy hour, it's "Social.". Yeah, ok.  Awesome.   Furthermore each item we sampled included some sort of out of the ordinary ingredient that seemingly didn't belong. This worked terrifically well on the chopped salad.  This dish was just a unique medley I would have never thought to mix.  However the odd ingredient technique fell flat with the pork (fruit??) that was otherwise a terrific dish.  It also didn't work with the bread pudding (bacon).  Now, I know what you're saying, "bacon is never a bad idea."  While that is usually accurate it was completely unnecessay in this dessert and actually disrupted the flavors.  Strip out those mediocre additions and those dishes would have been perfect.   Overall, while gimmicky the food is executed professionally and if in Scottsdale you won't go wrong here.  Maybe one day I'll come back to "Citizens" for "happy hour"...that'd probably be a 5-star review!

The used car dealership of dentistry.  I felt like a medium for their fleecing of the insurance company.  They refused to clean my teeth after I refused their up-sale to a costly (and unnecessary) procedure.  Also, the dentist didn't have the guts to face me himself and tell me this...they sent in the receptionist.  Not even a hygienist.    I recognize at least 1 of these "5 star" reviews as an employee.  Avoid at all cost.  Find a dentist committed to quality health care and not extracting the absolute maximum from the insurance company.  This place is what is wrong with health care in this country.

Unless you're a very tiny person you'll be uncomfortable at a sold out show.  The seating is CRAMPED.  The mixed drink prices are absurdly high.  Stick to beer if you want to get out of your 2 drink minimum for less than $35.  The seats in the back, behind the rail are very far from the stage.  It's a very cold experience.

Very friendly bar staff.  I come here mainly for that.  The food is ok and the setup is fine for watching a game but really, you can get that anywhere.  The happy hour specials are good as well.  It is definitely my first stop for a drink in downtown Chandler and often turns into the only stop.

They should change the name of this place to just "BBQ House."  The Texas part is unfair to them as the BBQ in the state of Texas cannot stand up to this place.  I say this as I meander through Texas tasting any smoked flesh I can get my hands on.    The brisket at the Texas BBQ House is the best I've ever had...hands down.  I've eaten enough in my time to fill an airplane hanger so I think I'm qualified on the subject.  If you fed this to a vegan, they'd leave the restaurant and go on a long spree of violence once they realized what they were missing in life.  It's that good.  Here's the thing though, average BBQ still tastes pretty good and most of your life you'll eat average BBQ.  Once in awhile you'll get a perfectly cooked brisket or pork shoulder or rack of ribs that blows your mind.  That's this place every single time.  I'm not kidding when I say I'd take a half-pound of their moist brisket over a surf and turf from any high end steakhouse if given the choice.  They only cook a given amount a day so make sure to get there early or call ahead to make sure they have what you want.  When a place sells out of food daily...that's a good sign.  They don't compromise their product by squeezing a few more briskets in the smoker.  They have a formula for delicious food and they stick to it.    Some would say the location and shack-like appearence are a downside.  It's out of the way for sure but I find that to be a good thing.  If this place were near my home I'd weigh 400 lbs easily.  If you come here and don't like the food, you just don't like BBQ.  You might like BBQ sauce but you don't like BBQ.  And if you don't like BBQ, I weep for your misfortune.

Good sandwiches.  The bread is really good and the prices are very fair.  I've driven by this place dozens of times and always thought "I wonder if that place is good." Now I know and it'll make it's way into the lunch rotation.

The food I tried was bad.  Not average but bad.  That makes it difficult to give this place more than 2 stars.  If I was just out for a beer before a movie this would be a good spot but I don't think i'd go for a meal.

I came in for Sunday brunch not too long ago and I was very impressed.  I'd been meaning to get to North for quite some time but location and timing evaded me.  Now that i've been, I certainly will find the time to go back.    Tradition dictates, for a watered down italian like myself, to eat Italian cuisine on Sundays.  Lucky for me North has happy hour all day on Sunday as well as a brunch menu to select from.  With 1/2 price bottles of wine it's really a great day to come to North.  We went with the $20 board (meats/cheese/etc) and bottle of wine to start and also ordered some pasta.  Everything was great.  The service was fantastic, the restaurant is beatiful (in that open kitchen industrial sort of way), and the value was tremendous.  Fox restaurants are typically pretty good but this one may be my favorite.  That's in terms of food.  If i want to drink $2 Icehouse and play ping pong, I still prefer Culinary Dropout at the Yard.

This is the best place for rolls in the greater Phoenix area in my opinion.  There are better spots for straight sushi or an authentic japanese dining experience but that's not what they're going for here.  The Sushi Room is a hip, laid back atmosphere with really creative rolls and appetizers.  I've been here a dozen times and I can tell you the service was a big problem for a long time.  I kept coming back because the rolls were so damn good and the value was tremendous (check out their website for their specials and happy hour).  I'm happy to report that on my last visit I had fantastic service.  There was more staff on hand, the girls who waited on our group were attentive and engaging, and the sushi chef even paid us a visit (along with an off menu creation of his!).  If that level of service continues this is easily a weekly spot for me.

OSHO is great.  It's fun to hang out on the patio when there is good weather (bring your dog!) or even when the weather is very hot.  That's because the whole patio is surrounded by fans and has one of the best misting systems I've seen.  The food is pretty good and the beer selection is great.  I always have a good time here.    The only downside would be that it's quite out of the way but that's just an excuse to extend your stay when you make it out there.

This was my first time at the new location and I was extremely pleased.  Four of us were able to walk up and be seated immediately...which I'm not used to with the original location!  To make matters better the restaurant is spacious, well decorated, and comfortable.    The food is outstanding.  I feel like anyone rating it less than 4 stars is doing it because they feel the prices are high.  I feel the prices are fair.  You're getting top quality ingredients and excellent food.  A little bump in price is fair.  Our bill for a bottle of wine, an appetizer, and two pizzas was $88.  $22 apiece and we all left full and happy.   If you're in the Camelback area and want to experience the same great food as the original without the cramped atmosphere and two hour wait, this is for you!

The food here is outstanding.  I reiterate my previous 5 star rating from last year.  We waited 5 minutes for a table and had our food within 10 minutes of ordering.  The pizza is spectacular and the pasta doesn't disappoint.  I think they could do better with the dessert menu but overall it's fantastic.

First off, I'm not a big fan of Greek food.  That said, I really enjoyed my lunch here.  The location out in Ahwatukee is a nice addition to an area that otherwise lacks decent restaurants.  For lunch, they have their pitas for $5 which has to be the best deal in town.  I had the chicken soulvaki pita with fries and had a bite of the fallafel pita also ordered.  We also had the jalapeno hummus as an app.  Everything was good.  My chicken was a little dry but at $5, that's forgivable.  The hummus was very good and the fallafel was really tasty.    The food, what I tried anyway, is pretty good.  Not outstanding but a really good option for lunch or a casual dinner.  The value was terrific.  I liked the small patio seating area and the fact that the side windows open up the dining room on a nice day.  I also like the fact that the manager/proprietor sat down at the table next to us and apologized for the poor service the woman received.  He then informed the woman the server was no longer employed but that was no fault of hers and was something they knew was coming.  My only regret to the day was wishing I showed up 10 minutes earlier so I could have witnessed the incident that led to a server getting let go mid-shift!

This place was really lousy and I'm frankly shocked at the high reviews it receives here on Yelp.  The only reason I tried it was the solid average rating it has.  That was a mistake.  As this was my first time eating here I decided to order numerous items and sample as many items as my stomach would allow for one meal.  I started with the rolled tacos and they weren't too bad.  Not overly crispy and a good amount of cheese and guac accompanied them.  Not great but not bad.    Next I tried the fish taco.  This was awful.  The sauce was slimy, the fish has no crispiness, and the tortilla was lousy.  Other than that, it was good.  I then moved on to the carnitas taco.  Again, the tortilla was lousy.  Think cheapest store bought corn tortilla you can find and nuke it for 10 seconds.  At this point my wife and I started the following conversation:  Her: "I'd rather have Los Taquitos." Me: "Or Espo's." Her: "Or Filiberto's." Me: "Or even Rubio's...."  This went on for about 3-4 minutes.   Lastly we tried the Chili Verde burrito.  It was no better than anything prior.  The meat wasn't good and the sauce was funky.  This is not good food.  I don't care how you slice it.   Maybe the breakfast burritos are good but I'll never know.  There are too many other good Mexican restaurants in town where I know I'll be enjoying my meal.

Food is always good (love the Philly).  Happy hour is 3-6 daily (despite what the website says!) and they have a bunch of tapas for a couple of bucks during that time.

Love the happy hour.  Goes until 7pm and you'll find $5 cocktails, $3 beers, and apps in the $6 range.  Go for the philly eggrolls.  The beers on tap are few but they have some nice choices.  For dinner, the Del Frisco's brand demands quality fare.  This isn't their flagship Double Eagle Steakhouse but they still serve various steaks on the menu along with more casual options.  Valet parking is free, just have the hostess validate you on the way out!

Really good food.    The whole belly clams were delicious and the Connecticut style roll was heavenly.  While not cheap, the food is high quality and you expect to pay through the teeth for seafood in a desert.  You'll spend about $20 per sandwich and they're served on a buttery roll about the size of a hot dog bun but overflowing with meat.  I ate two and felt good after but I'm a pig.  A normal person would be fine with 1.  Each sandwich came with chips.   I've heard the lines get crazy here but I was only in line about 15 minutes and had my food shortly thereafter.  If you see this truck at a festival or event and the line isn't a mile long don't hesitate to jump in.

These were brought into work today and I was stunned by how good they were.  I'm a big fan of Bosa Donuts but what I just ate was better than any I've had from Bosa.  I'm going to need to go back about 6-7 times to make sure there is consistency!

Another place that I had high hopes for but was let down by.  The food was ok.  The coffee was very good.  The service was abysmal.  First, they have an item on the menu called the grand prix which is available until 11am.  Well, that's what the menu says anyway.  I tried to order it well before 11am but was told no.  Not "sorry, we're out of ____."  but "no."  Ok...i'll try something else.  I ordered a breakfast burro and turkey crepe.   And then I waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.    We waited 47 minutes for our food.  For a crepe and burrito.  I know it was 47 minutes because I studied the receipt for about 25 minutes out of boredom.  A couple of staff asked about us after 30 minutes and then went to check on the food.  They told us we were next.  Liars.  I saw at least 5 orders come out before us.   So long story short, the Crepe Bar has one Crepe pan apparently.  Go ahead and eat next door at the bakery.

Went back, against my will but I'm glad I did. The food only took 20 minutes this time and they set the expectation that it'd be 30 when I ordered.  That's how you under promise.   The line to order took another 15 minutes so there are still issues but the food was excellent this time around.  Both spaces next to the Crepe Bar are empty.  For the life of me I can't understand why they don't expand or move to a space with a kitchen that would allow them to service more people. If I could get my food in 20 minutes from walking in the door I'd be here weekly. As it stands I'm here annually. I know I'm not alone in that.

Great coffee if you like cold brew and fast yet delicious food.    I had the banging pocket which was a delicious pita stuffed with eggs, awesome Schreiner's sausage, and smoked gouda.  I also tried the Tortilla Espanola which is a great take on the traditional Spanish omelet.  In Spain, tortilla = omelet so don't expect any circular discs of cooked masa.  The Portuguese donuts are tasty treats as well.  Basically, they're fried dough with powdered sugar on top.  Simple and yummy.    The line moved quickly and the food came out rapidly and accurately.  The price is fair as you can have a very hearty breakfast for two with coffee for about $25-$30.  There's patio seating or plenty of tables on the interior.  If in the 7th Ave area, this is a great breakfast/brunch spot.

New Vegas is a complete and total rip-off for the most part.  The land of $50 cover charges, $20 drinks, and $500 dinners replaced the $5 steak dinners and nearly free booze of long ago.  In exchange you get some very swanky places, gourmet food, and world class chefs...but you also get the worst kind of humans.  Javier's balanced all of this perfectly somehow.    The restaurant is in the Aria and is very sleek and modern.  The music, while a little loud, made the atmosphere upbeat and fun.  The service was solid, the crowd was upscale but not fake and, most importantly, the food was very good.  Now you're still paying $30 for enchiladas but in this setting you'd expect a lot more than $50 a person for dinner and a drink.  The margarita menu is pretty great even at $16-$18 each.    The Cabo Azul was a great dish and I left stuffed.  The chile rellano was my favorite part but all the way around the table the food was great.  I'd certainly come back.

Chop is like a really pretty girl who is an airhead that can't hold a conversation with you.  You can only admire the beauty for a few minutes before being driven away by the flaws.  Chop is a nice looking restaurant. A nice bar, sleek booths, a sharp decor, and a good looking staff all get your attention before taking your seat. And that's where the good stuff ends.  The menu is rather boring but that shouldn't be a problem as long as the execution is good. Well, the food here is really bad.  Like, really bad.  I've been multiple times hoping to finally find something they do great but, alas, there isn't anything. Meats are dry and boring (trying brining those pork chops guys!) and some of the items are so poorly conceived they are disgusting. For example, the spaghetti squash was prepared with a ton of capers.  I love capers but this was so bad it rendered everything else on the plate inedible. Capers and squash- the dynamic duo. But that's what you get here; a nice decor and a miserable effort by the kitchen.

Checked out the P&P for restaurant week.  We arrived early and decided to test out the happy hour specials at the bar before having dinner.  There are lots of apps for about $5 to sample during happy hour.  I recommend the beer cheese.  It was really good.  The charcuterie board was pretty good as well though I didn't care for jam.  The HH drink specials were ok with drinks and beer in the $5 range.  Might as well stick with the liquor.    The main event came around and I couldn't do the 3 course restaurant week menu on the account of the appetizers at the bar.  I opted for the Apocalypse sow (pork burger with bacon).  I wasn't in love with it.  I'd recommend going for the regular burger with a big slice of pork belly added on.  It'd be a $1 cheaper and better.  The rest of the party ordered various things, including the restaurant week menu.  The marrow bones looked great, the crispy chicken received good reviews, and the $2.50 cans of Hamm's were certainly enjoyed.  For dessert, the Elvis was probably the one that went over the best.  All in all, the P&P has a great atmopshere, creative food, and good specials.  I'll definitely be back.

Ended up here with a large group for a birthday party stop and I'm glad I did.  I would have never thought "hey, i should go drinking in an industrial park in Tempe" on my own.  After we all got done commmenting on "where are we and are we going to be murdered?" we went inside and discovered a very cool spot.  There is a large bar with open windows to the brewery's production facilities which is a great backdrop.  The rest of the of the tasting room has about 15-20 tables and stacks of board games for everyone to enjoy which was awesome.  The whole room was engaged in their games.    The beers available are obviously limited to the Four Peaks varieties and for food they had a featured food truck setup outside which was nice.  This is definitely a spot I'll take out of towners to in the future.

Hmmmm....salty pig parts.   This place is great.  I wish it was on my side of town because I would be a frequent guest.  From the nice beer selection to the solid happy hour specials to the delicious dinner entrees I never encountered anything I'd change (high praise from an egomanic).  The bacon (pork belly) and eggs was especially good as were the tacos.  If you're in the northern part of Phoenix/Scottsdale you should swing by here soon and give it a try...unless you don't eat pork.  If that's the case, why are you reading reviews of a place called the "Salty Sow"???

I can't remember the last time I was positively surprised in the way I was with Ginban.  I'm not sure what my expectations were but they were probably tainted by years of experience dining at mediocre sushi places in strip malls.  When you walk in you notice the really nice decor.  Stone walls, a nice long bar, dark colors...it's exactly what you wouldn't expect from the exterior.  As far as the food is concerned, it is really good.  The fish is super fresh, the rolls are very good, and the prices are completely reasonable.  It is easily the best sushi I've had in Ahwatukee.

Restaurants have 3 things they need to ensure in order to be successful:   First is good food.  That's the most important obviously.  Even if you hate everything else about a place you may come back if the food is good.  The food at Joyride is good.  Everything that came our way was presented well, tasted great, and was ample in portions.  Second is to make sure you have a good time and are taken care of.  Primarily, this requires good servers and providing value for your money.  The service here was a delight.  We actually got forgotten about and not served for 10 minutes but the waitress was so friendly and enjoyable that it was easy to forgive.  Regarding the value, the daily happy hour until 5 on drinks makes it hard to complain about.    The last thing you need, to me, to be successful as a restaurant is "it."  You know "it" when you see it.  Joyride has "it."  The atmosphere is enjoyable, the layout of the tables is comfortable, the patio is delightful, the colors are fun...everything just works.    This was my first time at Joyride and I'm itching to go back already.  A great place.

I'm updating my rating to 4 stars from 3.  I've made this my regular happy hour spot when I can get there prior to 6pm.  You can't beat the deals and the rotating taps are pretty great.  They've worked on some of my issues with atmosphere so you can tell they're trying.  Also, the bar staff is consistent and very friendly.   The pizza is still quite expensive but let me save you some grief; order the magical mystery tour.  It's a pesto base, mushrooms, and jalepenos and it is the best pizza I've had here (and I've had probably the whole menu).  It's unique to Mellow so it makes the price more reasonable.  A medium will feed 3-4 normal humans.

I've been about 50 times so it gets 5 stars.  The happy hour remains the best in the valley and the food is good.  The bartenders are great and the beers are constantly rotating and interesting.  Your best bet on food, in my opinion, are the sandwiches.  Get a half on a pita for $6 paired with one of the 50 or so beers and you're feeling good.    They also now have an app which allows you to earn free apps and stuff from your visits which is cool.

Tried this place out with a Restaurant.Com coupon.  The food was quite good.  The brisket and pulled port were both solid with the pork being some of the best I've had in a long time.  I don't like the fact that they cover it in sauce but that's easy enough to rectify during my ordering next time.  The side dishes were good and they have daily specials ($9.99 pork dinner, etc).  For a filling lunch or a casual dinner, it's a great option.  The interior of the restaurant isn't very appealing but it'll do.

The restaurant week menu was really a great deal.  I enjoyed the salad, the duck meatloaf, and the bread pudding.  Prior to dinner we hung out at the bar and sampled some happy hour fare.    Happy hour is a great deal.  They have a few apps in the $5-10 range and several drink specials including $2.50 drafts which is a great deal.  We had the sausage, cheese, and pretzel platter which was a perfect app to start out with.  The food is tasty here and I don't recall trying anything I didn't enjoy.  It is a little pricey (normally - not during restaurant week or at happy hour) and the atmosphere leaves a little something to be desired but it is definitely worth trying out if you're in the area.

If you've been to AZ Wilderness you probably had the same thoughts that I did.    1. This beer is great. 2. This food is fantastic. 3. This bar kind of sucks due to lack of space.  Well, they solved issue number 3 with the opening of their tasting room.  Now you can come in, get a seat, and have one of the 16 unique beers easily.  Between the restaurant, the small beer garden, and the tasting room there is typically plenty of space to accomodate your group.  For food, the burgers are excellent.  The wings are unique (watch out for the pin bone!) but very good as well.    The only downside is the location but even with that it's worth the ride.  I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.

Quite enjoyable.  Good pizza, fun concept, great value.  You'll pay about $8 for a salad or pizza which is enough to split or not (I didn't).  Don't go overboard and try to cram everything on a pizza unless you're just a fatso.  You'll end up with a soggy crust or grease and shame.  Stick to one of their prearranged pies or create your own with a few ingredients.  That's the fun part.  You can come back here 100 times and never have the same thing twice.    The downside here is that if you want to go at a typical lunch hour you may find yourself standing in line for quite awhile.  I arrived a little after 11a and literally 30 people walked in between 11:05a-11:07a.  I can't imagine how it'd look at noon.

I'm a fan.  Anytime i can sit outside, drink beer, people watch, and waste the day away I am fully onboard with that plan.  It's an interesting layout with a rooftop bar/lounge, indoor pub like bar, and outdoor dining.    The service and general operations have a way to go but i'll give it some time.  The issue with sitting upstairs is the food and most bar items are downstairs which can extend the time it takes to get your stuff.  Just more time to lounge around and watch Chandler's finest try to make themselves noticed.    The happy hour is pretty good with $5 pizzas (really, surprising good) and discounted drinks.  The beer selection is great and they have $5 Absolut and Pinnacle drinks all the time.   I'm interested to see how this place plays out in our brutal summers but I look forward to going back for various happy hours and casual lunches in the meantime.

I'm a fan of seafood.  I'm a fan of beer.  I'm a fan of eating with my hands.  I am not a fan of plates.  Therefore I am a fan of the Angry Crab Shack.  This place is fun and more importantly, the food is stellar.  You order your fish by the pound from the day's selections and choose your spice blend.  They boil up the fish and deliver it to your table to be poured out and eaten with your hands while wearing a bib.  They have some very good apps as well and the staff was extremely friendly.    The one downside is the wait can be extreme so be prepared.  The wait is well worth it though.

One of the best burritio I've ever had.  That's high praise, I know.  The short rib meat was fantastic and the burrito construction was just perfect.  It wasn't bursting at the seams but it was well filled and balanced.  Now, your main complaint might be "Mike - it was $13 for that burrito."  I hear you...it is expensive but then again, you probably will eat $8 in chips and salsa before you get that burrito.  Throw in the delicious rice and beans side it comes with and you're getting a fair price.    I've also had the crips (think mexican pizza) and the enchiladas.  Both were very good but I'll be sticking with burritos in the future.  Additionally they have a good happy hour M-F with 1/2 price apps.  The guac is definitely worth ordering.

The ultimate "meh."    You walk into this place and you're struck by the decor.  It's a good looking place.  Good looking furniture, good looking people, good looking design.  Then you notice there's no hostess stand and what appears to be a refugee camp of people crowded to your left.  If you push through that, you'll find a hostess with an iPad that will tell you it'll be 90-120 minutes.  What she won't tell you (or me at least) is that the tables by the door you walked in are first-come first-served.    The bar area is tiny for a place like this.  It seats maybe 15 and you'll have people hanging over your shoulders the whole time trying to get $7 beers while they wait in the refugee camp I spoke about earlier.    Once seated you get the priviledge of waiting 15-20 minutes to meet your waiter, who in my case was a very friendly gentlemen.  I think he was the highlight of the evening.   As has been said in many of these reviews, the menu is very narrow.  We had an app, 2 entrees, a salad, and dessert.  The entrees were good.  The gemelli with housemade bacon was very tasty and the cod was good.  Not $26 good but good.  The salad was literally a few leaves of iceberg and a cherry tomato.  We sent our app back (because it was cold) and then received it cold again.  Really?  Dessert (salted peanut butter bar) was difficult to chew and not really good.  All in with tip for two people we spent $100.    I like Culinary Dropout, Sauce, and Blanco and I'd heard good things about this place.  What I experienced was that this place is new & feels cool, so you want to believe it was great.  But if you look past the plastic surgery (of the restaurant and the audience) you'll find you could have done better for your money nearly anywhere else.

Have some self respect people.   Is the food good?  Yes.  Is your time worth anything?  If so, eat elsewhere. You'll wait hours (yes, plural) to eat.  Get here at 9am to order at 11am.  If you're here at 10:30 you'll still be in line at noon.   I give the business owner credit though. By deliberately serving slowly it pushes the line longer and, as the old saying goes, nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd. Besides, they'll sell their 100 lbs of brisket whether they process everyone quickly or over the course of 4 hours. Why bother hurrying?  A couple of miles away the Texas BBQ house has fantastic BBQ and will serve you in minutes. Have some respect for yourself and realize your time is worth something.

I honestly believe the food and setup here is better than the original restaurant downtown.  I had the breakfast sandwich on toast instead of the roll (highly recommend).  If you have an hour plus until your flight and want some breakfast, look no further.

Really fun place.    Regarding the golf you pay by the hour and, honestly, an hour is enough.  I'm a golfer and I'd had enough after about 45 minutes.  The games are pretty fun (I'd recommend Top Shot for a group) and the waitstaff was very good.  It's a little confusing the first time you go but after a bit you'll get the hang of it.   We ate dinner in the restaurant downstairs and the food actually surprised me in it's quality. Very tasty, fast, and reasonably priced.    It's not something I'd even attempt to go to on a weekend night as I can imagine it's a cluster@%@# but during the week, it's a nice spot for group outing.

Like the other Postino's there's a great atmosphere, great drink specials (happy hour daily from 11-5p with $5 mini pitchers of beer) and good food.  The staff were very friendly and the only real downside is parking.  With the restaurant practically on campus you'll likely be paying to park on the street.  If you're day drinking in Tempe, looking for a great date spot, or simply want a quick bit to eat you're do yourself well here.

While I haven't had the pie (yet!), I did get the chance to stop by and sample the pastry case.  I walked away with a moonpie (two cookies with marshmallow fluff inside all dipped in chocolate) and the red velvet twinkie.  Both were great but the twinkie was phenomenal.  I look forward to my next one...or two.

If high quality, healthy food at affordable prices is what you're looking for look no further.  This is a nice addition to Arizona as it combines all of the things you love about Chipotle (fast service, streamlined menu, quality ingredients) with what you love about asian cuisine (ramen, sushi).  The value is great as they have monthly specials which currently include a $9 combo of a big bowl of ramen, half a sushi roll, and a drink.  When you join their online club you'll get additional specials like free starters or BOGO meals on specified days.  The food itself is very tasty and the sushi was better than I expected with some interesting roll creations.    They're definitely still working out the kinks of a new staff but the management has been very good each time I've been.  On my last visit the manager came over and apologized profusely for us waiting a long time for our food and made things right.  It might have been the difference between us coming back or not and she did a great job.    If you're looking for a quick lunch or dinner and haven't been here yet, definitely give it a shot.

Finally got a chance to go to Ten and I walked in just as happy hour was starting.  As a result, this review will be for the happy hour offerings.  From 2p-6p they offer their "decompress" menu which is what a hipster calls happy hour I guess.  Whatever, the offers were great.  There are about 5 apps on the list that are discounted from their normal menu price.  I tried the fish tacos, hush puppies, fried green tomatoes, and the shrimp and grit cake.  All of those items were very good with the hush puppies being my favorite and the tomatoes being my least favorite.  The portions are solid and the quality of the food is excellent.  Lots of flavor and great presentation to boot.    On the drink side of things they offer several cocktails and $3 beers.  All the beers are bottled or canned but the selection is very good.    Service is attentive as you would expect in a small space like this.    Overall it was an outstanding value and I look forward to more "decompression" and trying them out for a proper dinner.    Regarding parking - avoid the garage and utilize the free valet in front of Del Frisco's.

It seems they have pretty steady local business and for that, I'm happy.  I do wish the restaurant success as the staff was very nice but my meal was very underwhelming and nothing I would even consider trying again.  For $9 I had a sandwich which left me hungry as it was awfully small.  The sandwich was pressed on the grill and still came out cold and flavorless.  For $25 for lunch for two, it should at least leave me full.  Good for them on the profit margin though.  Selling two slices of thin bread, 3 oz of roast beef, and a tomato for $9 is a lucrative racket.

I'm not sure which I was a bigger fan of; the delicious fried chicken and red velvet waffle or the ample free parking in the facist parking state that is the ASU area.  This diner is in the Graduate hotel and is a really nice spot for breakfast, lunch or brunch.  The menu offerings range from standard breakfast to quiches, sandwiches, burgers and the aforementioned chicken and waffles. There are lots of sweet treats like doughnuts, whoopie pies and shakes that I look forward to trying the next time I stop in.    Regarding the food, the biscuit sandwich was pretty boring and not up to the caliber of the waffle. Prices are fair and they even had an all you can eat pancake special going on for $5.  A waffle by itself will run you $4 and with the fried chicken it's $12.  The chicken was perfectly breaded and cooked so I'd recommend that.    If you're in Tempe and want a high quality breakfast without dealing with the Mill Ave parking, stop by here.

I've been to the one in Mesa and I recently came to the Phoenix version.  The difference is this one has a MUCH better bar setup, less wait time, some TVs, and BBQ.    Read my other review if you want to know about the seafood (it's fantastic).  For this review I want to tell you about the ribs I had here.  They were tremendous.  I am a BBQ hound and these were some of the best I've had.  I was blindsided by them as I was expecting regular restaurant ribs.    Seriously, the only thing better than a seafood feast with some cold beers is a seafood feast with some cold beers and ribs.    I love this place.  For a fun evening out with friends over good food I can't think of a better place to enjoy your evening.  Just wear something you don't mind throwing away!

Happy happy happy hour.    How's the sushi?  It's ok.  Don't care, happy hour. How's the service?  Mostly very good.  Don't care though, happy hour. How's the happy hour?  Glad you asked.  It's outstanding.  2:30p-6:30p every day and best of all, all day Sunday.  With a drink menu that is fun, a good selection of beers, a long list of apps, and a nice patio when the weather cooperates I see some commercial space next to Pita Jungle and the AMC coming available for you enterprising restauranters there.

Great food.  Great prices.  Super friendly staff.  I'm a fan!  Good italian food is, to me, the best cuisine.  This place has good italian food and they have it in any variety you want.  There are sandwiches, pasta dishes and desserts.  This is a great fast lunch or you could sit down on the patio and make a long meal out of it.  I had the chicken parm sub and it was very good as was the cannoli (filling made on site).    The subs are gigantic so get the half if you're rolling solo.  Actually, check that.  Live for once and get the full sub.  Save half for later if you must.

This is my favorite mexican food in the valley.  That's high praise, I know.  And some of you read that and will say "How dare he!  I prefer _____."  That's great.  Good for you.  But for my money and my time (most of those other places you'll mention are a 25 minute drive from Chandler/Ahwatukee) this is the place.  I was very happy when they reopened.    The green chili and the red sauce are top notch but I've yet to have anything on the menu I was disappointed with.  If you're in the neighboorhood swing by for some enchiliadas and a horchada and you'll go home happy, I promise.

It's a coffee shop.  A nice coffee shop.  They have cold brew on nitro which is interesting and unique.  The prices are ok.  The location is great.  It is clear these people care about coffee more than you care about what you do.  So that's nice.

I wouldn't come here without a voracious appetite.  I ate at 10am and 22 hours later I write this review, still not hungry.  You get your money's worth.  I had the omelet which was enormous and liberally filled with breaded fried chicken, peppers, and cheese.  Dynamite.  Additionally we ordered the Lo-Lo (3 pieces of Fried Chicken and 2 waffles).  That is a meal you can split between two normal human beings.  Throw in a gigantic mason jar of coffee, tea, Kool-Aid...whatever...and you're going to enjoy yourself.    Besides the very enjoyable food the atmosphere is vibrant and the service was fantastic.  Our server, EJ, was terrific.  Honestly, he was one of the best servers I've encountered anywhere including fine dining.

Not bad.  Came here for happy hour (3-7pm daily) and had a few apps, a pizza, some drinks and dessert.  Overall things were good.  The place is nice and the prices are fair for what you get.  The apps were just ok (chefs board, garlic knots), the pizza was larger than I expected and done well.  The desserts were really good.  The cheesecake and gelato were both outstanding.    There's a lot of italian/pizza places around but this one is pretty good.  If you're in the area this is a good spot.

I've never used heroin or any opiate.  However, I do feel like I understand the addiction.  The feeling I have immediately after finishing a blueberry fritter from Rainbow Donuts is a little bit of bliss, a little bit of sadness, and a quaking need for more.  The second and third never leave me with the same happiness and soon I'm sifting through their dumpster looking for any donuts they've thrown away hoping to again reach that initial blast of pure ecstasy.    They're that good.  The fritters are out of this world.  The cake donuts are spectacular.  The cronuts?  Mouthwatering.    Treat yourself.  Treat your employees or your boss.  Get on the treadmill or go for a walk in the afternoon and think of the sweetness you enjoyed that morning and will likely enjoy again next week.  Just stay out of my dumpster.

Great breakfast spot.  Lots of interesting options for your meal and several pastries to fulfill your sweet-tooth.    I went with the breakfast wrap which was ample in size.  It was full of eggs, potatoes, chorizo, and cheese.  The wrap was delicious and the green salsa it came with complemented it well.  Additionally, because I'm a glutton, I had a scone.  There are a few different flavors to choose from and I went with the Vanilla/Almond/Strawberry.  It was excellent.  The iced coffee too was very good.  If you're into lattes and the like there is a coffee bar to meet your needs.  The decor of the restaurant is great and there is ample seating no matter your group size.  There are about 8 tables outside as well.    The prices are a bit steep.  My breakfast was $16.  I'll be back but due to that reason alone, it won't be as often as I'd like.

I've been here a couple of times and enjoyed it for the most part.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the food prices are reasonable as well.  The pitas are good with the Ivy Club being my favorite.  It's basically a gyro and chicken sandwich with pitas as the bread.  The eggplant and shrimp app is great too. Some on here like the ivy fries but I found them very greasy.  The potatoes that came with the lamb skewers were just awful.  They were basically raw and when we told the server, he said "some people like them like that."    No.  No they don't.  There are ample wine selections and a few quality beers on tap.    Live music has been going on both times I've been there which has been ok.

Charlotte is trying with their airport food but it's still not great.  This place is new since the last time I was there and it got the job done.  Fast pizza and Stromboli at a reasonable price.  The Stromboli was very good and did the trick for holding me over until I got home.  They're big enough to split and it's a good spot for airport people watching (my favorite travel pastime).

Very good bagels.  Great selection of cream cheeses.  I had the bacon/horseradish which was good.  The menu is very limited but if you're in the mood for a bagel and coffee, you're in luck.    The bagel and lox was priced well and delicious.  It was $6.50 I believe.  An individual bagel will run you about $2.50 with cream cheese.  There are numerous coffee/tea selections.  The coffee is really good but priced a bit high.    I'm happy to have this option for a quick breakfast in Ahwatukee and look forward to going back.

I thought this was decent Chinese food but terrible Italian food.  Let me explain...  One of the entrees we had was a linguine with sausage, chicken, and white beans.  The sauce that dish is served in is chicken broth.  No cream, butter, or any other additive to make it an actual sauce, just chicken broth.  So what you have is noodles and other items in chicken broth.  It tasted like wonton soup from any fast Chinese food place you'd go.  Now, I love wonton soup but unfortunately this version wasn't nearly as good (lacked wontons) and cost $15.    The pizzas look nice but taste pretty bland.  The sauce lacks flavor and the most underwhelming part of the pizzas is...you guessed it...the crust.  I had at least half of these dishes remaining when we left and decided against boxing them up, which is uncommon for me.  I also tried some bruschetta as an appetizer and that was fine.  I remember the lemon one being no good, the fig one being tasty, and the other two were forgetful.    The service was attentive yet odd.  At least 4 different employees stopped by our table to ask how we were doing.  That's fine if it's not all within 5 minutes.  Then it's annoying.  Also multiple people tried to take our order which was confusing.    The atmosphere is good here.  The tables are a little crammed in but there's a decent bar, good happy hour selections, and a patio.

Updating my review.    After my last visit the management team reached out to offer apologies and asked for another chance.  I know all kitchens have off nights so I figured I'd give it another go for happy hour.    Happy hour is pretty good.  You have a few different apps and pizzas discounted, $3 beers, and $5 wines.  I tried the meatball sliders which were a winner.  The sauce they're served with was really good.  It had a kick to it from the abundance of red pepper flakes in it but that's not a bad thing.  It gave it a ton of flavor.  Paired with the Konig Ludwig on tap, it was a nice start.  I also ordered an Uncle Louie pizza at the recommendation of management.  I have to confirm that I still don't love the pizza.  Both times I've been I've had the Rustica size.  I'll give the Sicilian a try at some point but I'm out after that if it's no good.  The sauce is too watery for pizza and the crust just doesn't do it for me.  The toppings were good and overall it gets the job done if you're a small group looking for a quick and inexpensive meal.   If you read my reviews you'll see I'm a sucker for a good happy hour and I like this addition to downtown Chandler so I'll round it up to 4 stars.  I hope they keep focusing on the kitchen to give the food the attention it needs to make this a long lasting staple of the area.

For Sunday Brunch:  $19.99 for each player's club member in your party and $24.99 for the others.  Good selection:  omelet station, waffles, prime rib, shrimp, salad and a few prepared dishes and desserts.  Price includes coffee, tea, soda, etc.    The food quality is pretty good and the restaurant is nice.  If you'd been to the previous restaurant in this place, it's the same.

What a difference a little lighting can make.    I liked the old Public House Garage and Philly's has done well to not alter the space too much.  They've added some lighting to brighten it up and they're making alterations to the outside bar.  The beer selection is pretty good, happy hour runs 4-7p (drinks and select apps), and the food is good (for sports bar food).    Most of the booths have their own TV and remote to watch whatever games you want.  This will be a huge hit during football season.  They'll need to work out the sound as they kept playing music during football games which was upseting some tables.  Eventually they figured it out but the sound was low and not clear.    That said, the service was solid and friendly.  All told, it's a good start.  Let's hope they keep it up!  It's no surprise if you've been to this shopping center before but the parking situation is -37 stars.

"Are you ready to order?"    Our first time here was pretty impressive.  This is a beautiful space.  It's very comfortable, well decorated, and clean.  The wine list is extensive and the menu has plenty of options for sharing or going solo.  "Everything ok here, can I get you anything else?"  We had the Butcher Block which was just ok.  It came with a few cheeses and meats, some olives, and bread.  Nothing really stood out.  "Can I take that plate away?"  Next we had a grilled chicken salad (great), the empenadas (very good), calamari (ok), pan de ajo (very good), and the bruschetta (ok).  "Everything ok?  Need some more wine?"  The service, if you haven't picked up on it, was a little much.  I think the training probably lacked.  The wine was poured without tasting, there were questions of how everything tasted after nearly every bite, we were asked what else we wanted no less than 10 times, and the check was picked up the second I signed it.  I guess too much is better than too little but just as awkward.  "Happy holidays, you folks have a good weekend."  There was live music on Saturday night which was nice as well.  Prices were reasonable.  "Oh, you're still here...anything else I can you?  No?  Well then, have a happy holidays.  Enjoy your weekend.  Are you sure you don't want some more wine?"

Came by here on Saturday and really enjoyed it.  The layout is awesome.  Whoever the architect was did a fantastic job. There's 3 bars, tons of outdoor space, a beer garden which has coverage from the direct sun, and lots of TVs for your sports viewing pleasure.  The beer list is fantastic and soon they'll have their house brews ready.  Regarding food there is a decent variety.  This time I only had some fries from the outdoor kitchen (truffle) and they were outstanding.    I imagine this place will be a cluster late at night but for an afternoon out or happy hour you'll really enjoy it.  I look forward to coming back and trying out some house beers and the food.

I had very high hopes for Southern Rail. On the night I came we arrived a little before 6 so we elected to sit at the bar to take advantage of happy hour prior to eating.    The staff here hate each other.  Seriously, I've never seen a group of people with more vitriol in such a crammed space.  The 3 people working the bar took turns snipping and yelling at each other, arguing over who stocked what, and occassionally talking to customers to see if anything was needed.  There were two, a very skinny young lady and a younger guy with a hipster combover that HAD to have dated at some point.  The tension between them was uncomfortable.  I was waiting for him to ask for vodka and have her respond "why, so you can just stick it in every drink that walks by??"  But I digress.  The food was av-er-age.  For a place that claims to have roots in the low country of Charleston, it was very disappointing.  It seemed everything lacked seasoning.  If I could describe the food in one word, it'd be "bland."    The prices were reasonable and the outdoor patio/bar area is very cool.  I wanted to like it but i was let down.  I wouldn't go back on my own but if a group chose to go here, I'd go along to give it another try.
