Dealer wanted $500 to repair a motor not rolling up passenger side window. Angel's did it for $80.00 :)

Seldom that I tell a strange man that "I love him", but, I told Dan. Android has some lame feature that your SD Card & phone will be COMPLETELY WIPED CLEAN if there are too many invalid login attempts. I had my phone in my back pocket, must've been moving side-to-side, too many "unsuccessful login attempts", EVERYTHING WAS GONE!!! Dan was referred to me by a coworker, and, to my extreme delight & relief, Dan recovered 100% You know you are working with Solid Gold when you work with Dan.  I HIGHLY recommend Dan and will always make the 45 minute drive if I have something that will give Dan the Business. A+++

I've been a patient here since February 2014. In the 1st year I primarily saw Dr. Ellison. Dr. Ellison seemed to really care, and I felt like he listened to me, made sure we were on a manageable treatment plan. For the past year +, I've seen Nurse Practitioner, Leann. I've been very happy with the level of care, attention, I've received from this office.  The Medical Assistants take time to chat w/me, and are all pretty cool. LeAnn is outstanding to work with. She never makes me feel that she is in a big rush, write a prescription, then leave. No, she is not only kind & patient, but, very knowledgeable. I feel very comfortable with me & my wife's Health Care being in "her hands". Also, my job requirements are pretty spontaneous. The Front Desk has been incredibly accommodating when I need to shift an appointment to another day or time. Also, on very rare occasion, I've had to cancel an appt. on short notice. I was very grateful they chose not to charge me the $20.00 co-pay like my previous Family Practitioner did. Overall, I am very happy with the attention & care I've received from both LeAnn and Dr. Ellison & Staff.

The Store Staff & Pharmacy Staff are generally very nice. However, the parking lot, sidewalk, garbage cans are disgusting and unkempt. Pay someone to stay on top of it, make it respectable.

It's a Subway, can't go terribly wrong.  What makes this location exceptional? It may sound simple, may sound like "no big deal", but, to me, it made a difference.   As the lady finished up my 2 footlong sandwiches, she realized these 2 sandwiches were for 4 individual people, she wrapped each 6 inch separately, -AND- wrote "Dad" on one, and made the other 3 easily identifiable, too. Very cool. Without being instructed or asked. This lady "gets it" :) 5 Star Service right there!!

I love the food here. The place is clean and simple. Whenever I call in (we only do 'take out' here) there are people eating inside. Shows me that people like it here. The place is small, a tiny 'hole in the wall' type place, but GREAT.   I do agree with one other reviewer though. The owner does over charge for things like soda, drink refills, bowls of rice.  Otherwise, ENJOY!

Garage Door repair is something I know ZERO about. It is comforting when something you own is repaired and you feel like you received honest, fair, pricing and work. Rod & Josh are on-top-of-it!! They return calls promptly, offer fast service, and you aren't going to feel like you got "hosed" in the deal. I highly recommend 'Upright Garage Door & Gate".

I bought a sandwich. Went to use the restroom, there was no working light in the restroom. I went and told a male employee and he responded that he knew about it, and it had not been working for a few days. I found that very disturbing that people might be discouraged to clean their hands because they could not see.

I hate to give Nordstrom's a poor review. I LOVE Nordstrom's. I was about to write a poor review about Nordstrom's because for the 2nd time in 6 weeks we bought something from Nordstrom's and they left a security tag on an item and we didn't realize until we were home.  I called Nordstrom's Scottsdale Fashion Square, Brass Plum, began to explain my aggrevation and the manager politely interrupted me and offered to drive out to our house and remove the tag.  I was relieved.  45 minutes later, a manager was in my home briefly and took care of our stress :) Thank you, Nordstrom's. You were going to continue to receive a steady stream of our Money anyhow, but, it's nice to know that you do actually appreciate it :)

Thank you Harkins Theatres!!! With Loyalty Cups & Popcorn T Shirt, I was able to take myself, 2 daughters, & my nephew to the Matinee showing of "Finding Dory" w/drinks & Popcorn around $30.00.  Thank you for creating affordable Family Fun.

Today, I went to this location to ship some things I sold on EBAY.  I was fortunate to have been helped by the Owner at this location. I did not know he was the owner until I was leaving. This man took the time to pack my box and items for me, and because he packaged the box & items with his expertise, he saved me $20 in UPS Ground Fees. I really appreciate him being willing to help me, even at the expense of costing his business a few bucks. As I was leaving, he told me that he also prints business cards, Banners, and does Vinyl Sign work. I will definitely continue to rely on this location for all of my shipping needs and printing needs.

I had never been to a Barber Shop before. I thought in would try this place for a Beard Trim. I had my beard trimmed here, outstanding. After 2 beard trims, I also got my hair cut here. I normally would get my haircut at Great Clips. Now, every 3 weeks, I come here from Mesa, 25 miles away, for a haircut & beard trim. There are TVs with Sports on, the guys cutting hair,the Barbers, are all super cool.  This place is more expensive than Great Clips, but, conversation is on point, beard trimmed perfectly, hair cut is excellent. It's worth the drive and few extra bucks. This place is Awesome.

Augusta Ranch Location -   I love the Great Clips App. Download from Google Play Store, or, Itunes for Iphones. I always "check in", then, go right to the shop. I rarely need to wait.  Today, Andi cut my hair, trimmed my beard, and rinse, for $13.00. Killer Deal!! I've had 5-6 different Ladies cut my hair. Before I sit down, the stylist will review the "notes" about me, how I liked my hair cut, etc. Today, first time seeing Andi, but, she had an idea of what we needed to do before I sat down. Anyway, I've not been disappointed with any hair cut at this location and I've been coming regularly for 7 years.  I will also bring one of my daughters here on occasion, allow a stylist to trim their hair, cut dead-ends, etc., minor/mid level cuts.

5 Stars. . . PERFECT  My 12 year old daughter's guinea pig passed away. I did not know what to do with the little guy's body. I called over to Pet Smart and they told me they would take care of it for $25.  The reason why I will take 100% of my Family's pets to Banfield forever is that the entire Banfield staff signed a 'sorry for your loss' card for my daughter and it arrived in the mail today. It was incredibly touching and showed that they cared and they understand how much people's pets mean to them.   Thank you :)

I've had Brian help me with my computers a few times over the years. He is very knowledgable, patient, and reasonably priced.  I recommend Brian to all my friends/colleagues as a trusted resource.  I use Brian when I need to, and he does such an excellent job, I rarely need to speak with him :)

I brought my 6 yr old nephew & 8 yr old daughter to TechShop last Friday, as you recommended, for the "springtime activity night".  They had an Absolute Blast!!! The wreath creation was incredible. They had so much fun learning about, and being introduced to sewing when they sewed the bunny rabbits. The gal helping them was amazing. Very patient, very kind, very helpful. She was Awesome!!  Then, we decorated vases with stickers and Josiah(sp) helped the kids & I use the sandblaster. What a fun experience! Josiah was so cool to the kids. He was helping them navigate the blaster, coaching them, and they got understood/applied his instruction!   They both have not stopped talking about how much fun they had. They continue to ask "when are we going back?" Needless to say, my 12 year old daughter is anxious to come with us next time.

Funktion Design created/installed our company logo, enlarged it, and put it on one of our walls in our reception area. It looks incredible and makes an awesome impression as clients, applicants, and partners, enter our building.

Trampoline park is fun for kids. We made the mistake of purchasing the "Birthday Package" from Krazy Air, which included "Party Sub", made on site by "Krazy Sub". I go over to get the Sub Sandwich, and the teenage boy is handling money, making sandwiches, cleaning up, all while wearing 1 plastic glove, the same plastic glove continously, and his other hand ungloved. NASTY!!!!

I'm no Thai food "expert". But, I've probably eaten at 8-9 different Thai restaraunts in my life. We LOVE this place, "Thai Kitchen".  Service is Awesome. Unless, they are super duper, ridiculously busy. Most Thai places I've eaten at seem to want to get by with less labor, using, maybe 1 Server, who also is the Host & Cashier. When this place is half full or less, you are good. If this place is over half full, don't expect your drink to be refilled as much as you'd like. Which, I like my Thai ridiculously HOT, so, I need the Water & Diet Coke on point. This place is Awesome. Clean. Friendly. Killer food. Nice ambiance. You'll dig it :)

We love Rudy's on Ellesworth & Baseline. We've ate Rudy's for 10 years. The new location does not disappoint. Personally,  I don't know if I like the particular spot they are at, ONLY because if Rudy had not told me they were opening there, I would not have known they were there?! Inside the parking lot there are so many trees, I couldn't even see their sign until I was right up on it.  From Guadalupe, you have NO CHANCE of knowing his place is there, or, seeing his sign, because of the trees. Food was excellent.  I would create better signage.
