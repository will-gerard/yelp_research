Great thai in Vegas. Thanks to yelpers for highly recommending this place. Its a small hole in the wall place and located in a dark side of vegas. With the hustle bustle of the sin city this comes as an excellent reasonable delicious find. We ordered Bamboo shoot with veggies in red sauce with Fried Rice and Drunken noodles. The entrees were both excellent. Tasted so good. The separate order of fried rice was screwed up and when we told this to our waiter he was quick to react and remove it off our bill.   They have a hoard of vegetarian dishes and for once we didn't have to explain our needs to the staff. The reason for four and not five stars is the service was darn slow. It took close to hour and half for our entrees to arrive.

We ventured into this neighborhood trying to get some neat food on a cold night. Since it was our first night in vegas and we dint know this side of the city very well we ended up coming in the wrong side out from our hotel and i must say the route was super scary to walk by. I barely thought of how could any restaurant be tucked in this neighbourhood. Once we went in we were seated and we ordered malai kofta ( very enriching taste) and korma with naan. The food was overall very good. The service was not exactly great or worth mentioning but the power of food overpowered the service and hence the solid four stars.

Wonderful helpful staff. Pleasant stay in henderson and minutes from the Red Rock National Conservation Area and other Nevadan attractions. We stayed in one bed suite and the complimentary breakfast and amenities were etched to perfection. The rooms are typically furnished for someone to move-in with equipped kitchen cookware and dishwasher. Pretty neat. Beautiful drive from here to strip as you get to enjoy the nevadan landscape and beautifully stretched mountains.

As soon as we reached vegas we were in search of some comfort, authentic food. While we were browsing this on yelp we stumbled upon india masala bar and grill. As weird as it may seem they had one of the excellent rasam ( A soup) i've ever tasted. Dinner was as well a buffet spread with neat array of items ranging from south indian to north indian. Surprisingly the sambhar,rasam,pakoras were mind blowing and mango lassi was nothing short of stupendous. Garlic naan was so soft and flavourful.  The front desk staff was very cheerful and attentive. The buffet price was pretty kind on the wallet too. I believe if you take some buffet food to-go its a couple of dollars cheaper, but i've no idea what you may be able to fit in a box in their wide selection of delicacies.

One of the worst pizzas I've ever had in all my life. Its not an exaggeration trust me. After a long flight from St.Louis to west side of the coast and a quick halt at arizona we brought our semi hungry selves to this place and we fell short of food options at the terminal we were in. We browsed through their selection of pizza to find a vegetarian option and we went with the margherita pizza topped with basil and tomatoes. Unbelievable as to how could someone completely turn around the recipe made with scramble of simple ingredients. The crust was horrible and the basil wasn't baked along with the pizza it was rather sprinkled ribbon cut over the baked pizza with just marinara.It was like the leaves were flying away as we were trying to bite into the pizza. Gosh and the price I know that its airport and its supposed to be pricey but 14 dollars for a flat iron rubber like pizza duh! Please don't eat even if you are starving you'll just end up spoiling your tastebuds.
