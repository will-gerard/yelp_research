Place is nicely remodeled but the service is super slow and so is the food coming out. It's only a Thursday morning after a breakfast rush. Won't come back if I'm ever in a hurry

Went to have dinner for our 2nd year anniversary. Our waitress Nicole was completely awesome she took care of us in every way possible. She knew her menu she knew her items she even took a picture of us and printed out and brought it to us for memories and then as we were leaving she brought us a parting gift of a box of truffles. The manager Marc was awesome we definitely enjoyed our experience at Flemings and will be going back

Just got my hair cut, colored and styled by Brandi. She was awesome! I found this salon by Google then read the yelp reviews and called during my busy lunch hour. Brandi understood I was super busy but took the time via text to ask everything I wanted down to the color that she did not have on hand. She ran the same day and got me the color I wanted by the brand I wanted without question. Her customer service throughout the experience was wonderful. She listened to what I wanted and made sure I was a happy customer when I left. I will be back and I will bring my daughter to fix what ulta couldn't do. I will definitely let everyone know about the salon, especially Brandi! Thank you Brandi see ya soon

I love coming here for their breakfast comfort food and so does everyone else. The service is good considering they are always busy we come and there is always a wait.  The food totally makes up for it but when it is busy and your hungry, expect your food to take a while to come out. I will keep coming back but maybe when it isn't so busy.    Ok I know I just posted a good review for TJ's, but really? Where shall I start today? First off it was busy like it always is, no problem. It took over 5 minutes to get a drink order. Again, no problem....  I ordered the country fried steak and eggs I wanted my eggs scrambled well with cheese and I got a side of biscuits and gravy. My son also ordered the same thing his eggs scrambled as well but he got hashbrowns and sourdough toast. Our order went into the kitchen at 10:35 AM and our order came out at 11:11 AM it took forever to get our order. Once I got my breakfast I noticed my eggs were still runny, but scrambled and there was no cheese like I ordered so I sent them back. I start to eat my chicken fried steak and after eating a few bites I notice it raw in the middle and I mean raw. I pushed my plate away and said I am done! My sons eggs were also runny and they forgot his toast which has happened in the past. We didn't ask for it because we knew it would take a while to get that too. This was the most disappointing meal I have ever had a TJ's. It will be a while before I go back.

This one star is being generous. The waitress who took our order forgot to take mine but then remember as she started to walk away. When the food came out it was over cooked.  Burger was dry and over cooked and not worth the 10.00 they charged for it. My fish fry was subpar. The fish was over cooked and the fries were so over cooked you couldn't eat them.  The cole slaw had no sauce mixed in with it. The topper of our quick evening was the drunk guy sitting next to us.  Every other word out of this mouth was the F bomb and my 13 yr old daughter was sitting there. Yes, it is a bar BUT it is also suppose to be a restaurant for everyone to enjoy. Needless to say my husband was going to take him outside and teach him how to be a gentleman. If we didn't have gift certificate for this place I wouldn't have gone there. 2 weeks before that we were there with 100+ bikers who behaved better than 2 tables that were in there tonight. We won't go back!
