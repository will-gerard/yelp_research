I've had this place clean my suit for awhile now, so last week I decided to bring in a wool sweater of mine in also. Big mistake. I got the sweater back and initially it looked fine, but today when I went to put it on I discovered it had 8+ holes in it! I will be taking this to the owners, and most likely never coming back here again.

After seeing all the good reviews of this place on here, my girlfriend and I decided to give this place a try. She ordered the veggie roll and I tried the What The Heck roll. The presentation was very good and both of our rolls were simply delicious, we'll definitely be coming back.
