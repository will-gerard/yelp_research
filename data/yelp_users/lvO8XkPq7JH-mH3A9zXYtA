I never thought about taking my dog to the groomer before, instead I would just washer her in the tub at home.  Sure it was time consuming and hard on my back, but it was cheaper than a groomer.   When my dog started to become so itchy from allergies my opinion changed. This groomer offers a "hot oil treatment" for dry and itchy skin.  Long story short, I took my pup in for a bath and brush plus the extra hot oil treatment.  The results... fantastic.  First of all, she was cleaner than I've ever been able to get her and she wasn't as itchy.  The biggest or rather best part was the lack of shedding after her brush out.  The second time I took her in, I just had the bath and brush.  Two hours later and my dog was smooth and shinny again.    I plan on continuing my at home washes for "maintenance" but when the shedding needs tamed again, I'll be back.

My sister and I, on our second day in Arizona, went walking around "downtown" Glendale.  We were hot (July!) and needed coffee.   We found this place on accident.  Inside sat two women, talking quietly among themselves.  At first we felt like an interruption, but this couldn't have been further from the truth.  One woman jumped up, took our order and poured us a delicious cup of strong, but not bitter coffee.  The other woman, after finding out we were new in town, began telling us all about Glendale and Arizona from the history and weather to her intriguing past.  Overall, a nice coffee break.  I will return.

It's a Paradise. Friendly service and consistent food as per the average Paradise. Perfect for a quick bite.

Don't bother with this place.  They were completely rude over the phone, which to me says they did not want my business.
