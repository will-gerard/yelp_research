My husband and I decided to dine at Red Lobster this past week. We were ready for some seafood and thought it would be the place to go. I should have realized we were in trouble when we saw that they were not busy! We both ordered grilled and steamed seafood dishes with salad & vegetables. First the salad was brought to our table and the bowl had about 5-6 pieces of lettuce and two tiny pieces of tomato and cucumber-are you serious? It was less than mediocre! Then our main dishes came and the seafood was horrible. My scallops smelled funny and tasted bad. I bit into my shrimp and they were very mealy and had no real flavor. The grilled Lobster tail was ok-it's hard to ruin. My husband had to send his white fish back-it tasted horrible & they brought him grilled shrimp-same bad taste! Our only positive thing was our server. We asked to speak to the manager and they said they would be right over. After 15 minutes of waiting we got up & left. Don't waste your time or money at this place!!!

BRAVO! Amazing store with clothing you won't see anywhere else! Just purchased chic dress, skinny jeans & a great top that goes with just about anything! It's great to have store that isn't catering to 18 year olds!

Great customer service & great rates! We switched our car & homeowners insurance to Az Insurance . They were quick to respond with quotes & information on all of their services & saved us a great deal of money on our policies!
