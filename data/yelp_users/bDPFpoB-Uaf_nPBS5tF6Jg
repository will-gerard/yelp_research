Horrible service, whether busy or not. Pizza is always limp, soggy or undercooked. Baked Tuna Sandwich is bitchin'. Pizza Cookie is ok. Go to Scottsdale or Tempe location instead.

Let's not get too crazy with the five stars and Vietnamese food. It's hearty, affordable and fast. It may not be savory but, however, remains delicious for both humble and economic reasons. And that's okay, because I want to experience different cultures and their cuisine without all the American influences.  Tasty offerings include the (#3) beef with egg roll and their "pho bo."  The beef is seasoned "awesomely" and comes with fried spring rolls over a California-king-sized bed of rice noodles and greens. As for the "pho", it is a very delicious soup that you must try at least once in life.  Lastly, compliment your meal with a Tai tea or Vietnamese coffee and you'll leave much more caffeinated (and perhaps happier) than you arrived.

I'd rather eat from the lobster tank because that was the cleanest place in the joint. For the price of these "seafood" dishes, one could be eating cuisine from a real chef at Vogue instead of the microwave meisters, Julio and Juan.

Buy a burger, put on your own toppings, and destroy! Why so serious?

An amazing offering of pastries and baked goods for which I thought would only exist in the Midwest or East Coast. Get there early for the free smells and to chew the gum with the snow birds.

Whether you treat breakfast like dessert or like bbq, this is the place to start your day.  I recommend the ridiculous waffle or the salami scramble. What I am talking about... order both, you deserve it!

My favorite place for tea. I like the LAN-party type feel of the place which is a change from all the redundant art gallery meets coffee bar hipster hangouts. The hours are great and can't wait to try the coffee next time.

A great place to chouch out downtown. I was reluctant to try the grub. Georgie told me to try the grill cheese and tomato soup. I did and I liked it. This place gets packed early so make your trip to Lost Leaf earlier in the night.

Dropped in for lunch and went for the half BLT sandwich with side of Beef Stew. Was not impressed with the limited selection of everything in the market but at least lunch was bitchin'! I'll have to slide into the coffee shop next visit.

Glad I had a BOGO coupon, because this place sucks. I may slide in for happy hour at another time but there's better places for less at Westgate and Park West.  If you have to hit this chain, try 59th and Bell.  Tips: - Correct usage of past-tense in "Steamed vegetables." How long ago they were steamed is the question. - When did fish have a casing? Mahi Mahi dog ftw! - No refills for drinks so make it last.

The only reason I give this place any stars is because of the bar and Sunday package. The restaurant is always empty when I visit. It's probably because of that old woman that roams around the place cackling at you while you eat.

The best supermarket in Surprise. They always have what I need and the people are always friendly. Newly added is four more express lanes, which means you can skip the long line of senior citizens/soccer moms and check yourself out. I'd skip on any wine or liquor purchases and hit that Total Wine or World Market.

The most friendly dump and dive in Phoenix.  Friday night is a good night to chill; Saturday night to skank or jive with the band.  The amount of skunk beers in the can is bitchin' and drinks come in plastic cups -- heavier on the sauce than the ice.  Tips: Friday is the night to chill Bring cover on Saturday Grab a few Old Styles Ask for no coke in a Black Russian

All the wine (by glass) taste the same because they've been sitting out for days. I am not much for chocolate or sweets so I'll save a star for those who do. They do offer some of the best Spanish wines by the bottle, however, and may be worth a trip to grab some rare vintage. So skip the food, skip the wine and ask what's new from Spain / Portugal (unless you really enjoy a warm glass of vinegar.)

A great place to grab a bite if you're out of time and happen to be downtown. Notable dishes which I recommend are the Spicy Korean and Tai Mango Chicken. I mean if you really wanted to try something spicy, healthy and delicious, you wouldn't be gnarling those Big Macs, would you? Plus, Zoe's is just going to take forever and I don't think you want to eat at a greek IKEA.  - Time is but an illusion--lunch time, doubly so - Do tai chi or yoga before you find a parking spot - Grab as many fortune cookies as you can without feeling guilty

Quick and tasty "Chicago-style" dogs from one of the friendliest people I have met. If you're feeling brave or hard-core, try the garbage dog!

This Wisconsin dude approves of this custard. Don't ruin it with all that topping junk!  My favorites are vanilla, chocolate and malt.  And again, seriously dudes, you need accessories for your ice cream? You can do that to the crap some chums roll on a stone.

The best burgers in Phoenix. The owners are great and am on a first name basis. Forget about fast food and support this local business.   Go double. Add bacon. Park at Circle K if in a hurry. Plan on holding it until you get home. Stick to the burger and fries, genius.

This place shut down because it took 90 minutes to get an appetizer even when it was empty.

My favorite place downtown to relax and grab a drink at the bar/lounge or enjoy a cigar on the patio. I recommend trying a few of their 150 varieties of rum or a cocktail such as the Mojito Jamaica or Jamaican Mule. The drinks can be pricey, however, at this place, you finally get what you pay for.  Try the For de Cana 18yr for a rum with the finish and nose you'd expect from a cognac.

The seafood prepared here was the least fresh I have had in Phoenix. I've had better results with the Sushi at Safeway or Trader Joes. The beer and wine menu also needs something to separate itself from every other restaurant. If you're looking for Sushi on the far West side, the only joint left after the demise of Be Sushi is Koi (across from the Arrowhead Harkins).

This is the place to be in Surprise, even if there was somewhere else to go. I enjoy the daily specials such as New York strip, duck and sea bass.  If only the single chicks on the West Side didn't have to spend so much on diapers, the atmosphere would be a little better. Roman, Aurore and Rick are the best!  Tips: Ask for the specials. Ask to taste the wines. Leave room for creme brule. Sit at the bar. Leave those kids at home. Don't ask for Coors Light.

I've had Delux and 25 Degrees, but I still say the burger at Vogue is the best. Where else are you going to get grappa or amaro with your meal? It's nice to have a place to chill, avoid the blimps and flirt with the cougars while doing time in Surprise.

This is the best pizza I've had since Bianco. Why would I wait 3-5 hours downtown when I can slide down Glentucky to grab a hand tossed pie and homemade tiramisu? Not to mention, my parents said the pizza was on par with or better than what they've had in Italy.

There may be new owners but they still retain their most excellent chef.   - Don't be a puss and ask the chef for his recommendations. - You must try the lemon roll, volcano roll and sashimi salad.

This place is great for breakfast and however many cups of coffee the help remember to fill. I think two is the limit.  I overheard an argument between a customer and the manager about a brown steak. I think he watches too much CSI and should stop interrogating the customers. Have an alibi ready in case you run into any problems with your order.

No country for old buffet. The banter over tapas will never end just as my love for Sens with their "infusion" of different Asian styles and ingredients. The tofu, the cold duck, sweet & sour soup and fried quail were amazing. Add to that their wide selection of sake and it is heaven on an ill bloated stomach.

This is the perfect place to chill or meet people on this side of town. The sandwiches and wraps are unforgettable as well as the coffee and tea to compliment. Tables and chairs are well laid out and not the cheap lot you find at the typical coffee chain. I've yet to hear any complaints about the Internet (WiFi password on receipt) or variety of power outlets. Overall, I think those who enjoy this place are those who don't value their self worth by which logo is on their cup.

How hard is to keep track of a small fry and smoothie? They have yet to get my or my parent's order right at this location. It would seem that management is lacking as everyone is standing around trying to figure out what they should be doing.

Local Breeze is great open-air joint to grab a burger and a brew--just as long as you leave plenty of time between your visit and that next appointment. You haven't lived until you try the BBQ burger with a Mexican Coke.

I thought I'd be in trouble for trying a place that has happy hour all the time. Who would've known that fresh nigri, sashimi and rolls would follow the reasonable prices?  - Soup, salad and breadsticks... oops, I meant dessert, with your meal - Don't puss out when you sit outside without misters - Go for the healthier sake instead of Sopporo big gulps

You can't go wrong when you can get comfort food and Southern hospitality until midnight. Chicken, waffles, grits, greens, corn bread? Yes, please; all of the above plus some purple drink, too!  I'd avoid the early weekend mornings when the crows do their walk of shame.

Lola, on Roosevelt, is my favorite coffee shop in the Valley. They roast their beans on location and the quality of the coffee is superb. Jency and Lisa are the best baristas; always friendly, even if the last patron is the largest bitch or Richard. The tables and chairs are solid and comfortable; totally put Lux's lawn chairs to shame. And, lastly, if you are craving a treat with your beverage, they have the best baked goods. Overall, I don't any other place for coffee where they know your name, your drink and how to make your day.

Funk yeah! This place is the sheet for chilling downtown without the frown. Where else are you going to swamp yourself in artisan suds as well as the classic Shlitz? Rhetorical question--no where.  Just the Tips: - Roast beef sandwich is mostly awesome. - They have AZ wines if your man-meter doesn't sink to skunky beers. - If you want to talk to your pretty lady and retain your voice, sit outside. - For you veggies and squirrels, the mixed nuts and olives are well portioned.

The best lunch stop in the hipster district of downtown Phoenix. I haven't tried any of the carne-phobic choices but Verde definitely packs plenty of protein with their red chili beef, green chili pork and lime chicken.

I also tried the beef tacos and chilaquiles and they were fantastic. The chilaquiles can be made to order with your choice of meat and sauce. Since this place opened, I think I've been to La Tolteca or Chico's Grill only once.

With Lenny's and Lucky's being so close, the burgers here are a late night compromise, only. I'd rather have a side of peanuts over the soggy fries; that is, if they'd let you. And really, their burgers are really just an expensive version of something you'd expect to get from a campground grill or the high school cafeteria.

I feel that Local Bistro offers an amazing selection of food at an affordable price. Take the pork chop, for example. Both times I've ordered it, It was moist and delicious and complimented with fingerling potatoes and fresh spinach. I recommend the entrees to everyone and for the rest--well, you can get pasta and pizza everywhere.

A movie theatre with a lounge in downtown Phoenix? I think Scottsdale (I mean hell) just froze over. This is great venue for watching an independent flick while enjoying your favorite brew and Japanese snack. I can't wait to visit again because I've heard that FlimBar now has beer on draft!  I recommend the chili bits with a chimay or sesame snack with an oatmeal stout.
