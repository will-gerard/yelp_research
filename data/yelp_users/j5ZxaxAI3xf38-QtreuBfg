My boyfriend introduced me and my girls to this place 2 years ago. It became one of our Go To Places. The service, for the most part, was mediocre. Chasing your waiter to come take your order or get drinks isn't my ideal of great customer service. But we loved going because of the patio sitting and their delicious bean dip which used to be FREE! I understand times are hard and can't always have things for free but to start charging your customer $4.25 for a bean dip, it better come in a large bowl that feeds more than 3 people! If anything, there should be free refills! Otherwise change your price. I never knew refried beans were so costly! You're better off ordering your meal which gives you their rice and beans...and not waste your money on the $4.25 over charged bean dip.  #MediocreService #WhatWasOnceFree #OverPricedBeanDip #ValleLuna

It's very disappointing - the service isn't always great. The service is slow and the sushi isn't consistent. I have yet to like the way they cooked the calamari too - it always arrive chewy and hard at times which means it's overcooked! I have had their Mahi-Mahi a few times with pineapple rice. Once again its not consistent. It's either over seasoned and the sauce they use is too much so it gets all over the rice. I prefer the Kona at San Tan Mall better. Although I come here, to the Chandler site, often and gamble what kind of service & food I get....mostly because it's near my boyfriends house but I know what kind of potential they have because I have tasted it.

Lot's of great selections - my only main issue is that it's gets packed but hey, you can't blame them if they're doing great in business! :)

I met up with some friends. This place was highly recommended to me by my girlfriend and her hubby. They go here often. The place is old and could use an update on their interior BUT their food is great! I had their chicken shawarma plate. It was a large portion and I shared it with my kids. Their fresh handmade pita is the best!!! And oh yes, don't order their yogurt soda drink- it's not the best tasting and they will inform you "no refund! " :)

This place reminds of one of the restaurants that my grandparents loved going to when I was young - the food was good, the staff are very pleasant and helpful. Would definitely come back again. And love that they have a few selections of Gluten Free food - my mom would be happy to see that.

I ate at their restaurant and afterwards we just hang out at the club place after dinner to check out the beautiful view. It was still pretty early so it wasn't crowded. I've been here before where it can get super crowded and can't enjoy as much since you have to pay bottle service to be able to sit which is unfortunate.

We used to go here often when my girls were young. I love that they can enjoy their dinner and have a place to burn their energy. It's super family friendly and I love that. But I think I tired myself out from this place. I love their pulled pork BBQ, Their Mac N Cheese is delish along with their BBQ pit beans and don't forget, their lemon cake - it's too die for!!! If we have a big corporate meeting, I'm always pushing for this place for us to have catered.

Love this place!!! It's has become one of my go to places. They have great choices for both food & drinks during Happy Hour. It can be louder on some days but this is a sports bar, after all, so it's to be expected. I haven't had a bad experience with this place. The servers are always pleasant and the service is good.

Went here on 1/2/2016 by Instagram recommendation from a local friend. I've been craving Korean and unfortunately haven't had a great one in Chandler. We ordered their number 1B which included Brisket. Bulgogi Fried Rice. We ordered extra Bulgogi and Spicy Chicken. Sides came with Ban Cho (saut√©ed bean sprouts), Kimchi that were placed in heated pan - which have always been my fav side dishes. I've never had them warmed before but they were delicious. It came with other side dishes as well - pickled cucumber which another fav of mine, tofu and Daikon which is another side that my boyfriend loves. I love that they had 3 sauces for us to dip our meats with - my fav was the Korean paste. The whole experience reminded me of when my Korean girlfriend would take me to restaurants in LA. We were so stuffed but couldn't stop eating. We ate everything we ordered. It was that good!!! Thank you!!!

This is usually one of our GO TO places for my co-workers and I since it's close to work. Typically I order the Chicken Gyro Platter (which is the Shawarma version). Their portion has always been good but today, I ordered the Combo Mix Platter except I only wanted the Chicken Gyro and Beef Kabob and paid extra $2 for the Beef Kabob. The guy on the phone states if I wanted just those 2 items, it would cost me extra. So I paid for the extra dollar to only get 6 Beef Kabob and the Chicken Gyro was the same amount if I had only ordered the Chicken Gyro. Very disappointing. The Platter itself was already $13.99 and with the extra $2.00, I paid for a combo mix that was basically a single platter.

So I've gone a couple of times after my last review. We even dined in & tried their Baklava - that experience was nice. But my last visit was awful. So a co-worker of mine and I ordered our food to go. Unbeknownst to me if YOU ORDER A TAKE OUT, YOU ARE  NOT ALLOWED TO DINE IN. We were meeting up with our old boss and we knew our time was gonna be limited. I ordered my food  to go with the intention of dining in and just wrapping my food to go when I have to leave. BIG MISTAKE!!! The owner proceeds to lecture me when I went to grab my take out (mind you, I just tipped his staff $3) about how I shouldn't order "to go" if I had every intention to dine in. Of course it took me by surprise because I didn't really understand what the big deal was and why he was upset at me? I wanted it to go because I knew my time was limited and I wasn't about to waste more paper products by asking for a to go styrofoam. As he lectures me and raises his voice because clearly he's upset about something. I'm still confused because he's accusing me of knowing what his rules were! So I asked him "what happens when I can't finish my food?" He responds with "then you ask for a take out box!" So I responded, "aren't I eliminating that process by just asking for my order to go?" So he raises his voice at me and with my old boss next to me trying to order her food now.  My old boss was trying to figure out at the same time if she should order her food to go since it looks like he's denying us a table. She told him we didn't know and reminded him that many of our co-workers from our company dine in & order here often. He proceeds to tell her that she can order to dine it then looks at me says "this is my rules and you did not follow it. I told your friend what I told you so she knows my rule and you still disobeyed it. Please don't do it again and I will let you dine in with your take out!" I was flabbergasted! I honestly didn't know what to say to him. I get that he's trying to cut cost. I'm sure the "to go" styrofoam are more costly but having to waste paper plates and Styrofoam's would cost more because you're wasting 2 items oppose to just 1. They both will be in the trash can after use. Needless to say, I have not come back nor have every intention of coming back.

I love this place! It's definitely our GO TO place for breakfast and lunch! It's right close to our work so it definitely has become our place to go to when not sure where to eat for lunch. We love their burritos - it's large and very filling. Their rolled tacos are good and one of my new fav is the green chili burrito. I also love that they have a little bar that you can grab some pickled carrots to go along w/ your to go order. Their drive thru is a bit hectic but everything is made to order and their food is good so I think it's worth the wait.

It's definitely hole in the wall restaurant. I live nearby so I've seen the sign a few times. My fav was definitely the mountain roll. I love that they serve us watermelon after dinner...it's like cleaning our paletes. We didn't go during happy hour so it was a little pricey. The service was great. Would definitely come back again.

One of my fav place to go with my girlfriends! I used to drive to the one in Phoenix as well but of obviously it made more sense to the one that's closer to me! Love all the Bruschetta options, the wine and even their desserts! The staffs are great and love the place itself!!! My girlfriends and I always have a great time!!!

I love this place. It has become one of my favorite place to go for breakfast/lunch with my boyfriend. Yes, the meal is a little pricey but I feel like it's worth it. Everything they make is fresh and they serve pretty good food.

The food was great - we had the French boned Pork Chop, Grilled Cheese and Gorgonzola Pear Salad. Everything was delicious and the dessert was to die for - Chocolate Pecan Pie. Chef Stacey was great and our waiter, Mark was awesome as well. He was so knowledgeable! Great nite and delish food!

Whenever my co-workers and I get a chance to be near Backyard Taco, we make sure to make a stop at this place! I love the grilled veggies and their Carne Asada street tacos are great and flavorful.

My bf had a place in mind to go for breakfast for Mother's Day but I wanted to spend it w/ his sister and her twin boys so our plans changed. And I'm so happy it did! The place was very busy when we got there. We waited almost 20 minutes and was told that it was a 30 minute wait.  As we waited, we were informed by the other customers that they tend to be busy all the time but we won't be disappointed. And WOW! The wait was worth it. They were right! I love a good breakfast place. I love the customer service - they were fantastic. Very friendly and attentive.  The food was beyond what I expected! I ordered their "fresh squeezed" orange juice which was good. I love that you get 1 FREE refill for the Fresh OJ. And it was not to pulpy...just the right amount! My girls ordered chocolate and vanilla milkshake and both shakes were creamy & yummy. My girls definitely enjoyed it. Both of my girls ordered the kids pancake w/ bacon. It came w/ 4 dollar size pancakes and a bacon. My oldest ate 3 of the 4 of the pancakes. She loved that they were fluffy and delicious. My bf ordered their eggs and pancakes w/ home-style fried potatoes - he said it was delicious and ate every thing on the plate! I had a taste of the home-style fried potatoes, it was seasoned well and loved that it was cut smaller. The twins had cinnamon rolls with their large chocolate milk- the cinnamon roll looked gooey and yummy! I shared the famous chicken fried chicken w/ my bf's sister. She warned me that it was big so I prepared myself for it. It was delicious - the chicken was seasoned & cooked right and I love the French toast that came with it! We ordered cinnamon rolls to go because they looked so yummy and I was too stuffed to keep eating. I definitely over indulge myself! I love this place! Chandler/Tempe definitely needs a Breakfast house like this!

First time trying this place out. I ordered for pick up. I was advised by their employee to order the 20 inch  pizza since I had 5 people to feed but 2 of them are young kids. So I ordered 1/2 cheese and 1/2 Deluxe Pizza. Needless to say, when I went to pick it up, it was gigantic and more food than I had wanted since I also got their Fried Mac N Cheese Bites and Small portion of their Wings. The kids each had a slice of pizza so we had plenty of leftovers. The Mac N Cheese bites had mixed reviews. My kids do love Mac N Cheese (whenever they get it) so I thought they'd fall in love with the bites but I was wrong. My youngest thoroughly enjoyed the wings since it wasn't spicy at all and I ordered the Medium spice. Loved all the fresh veggies that came with the meat on the Deluxe. Will definitely come back.

I love this place!!! Their Hummus is creamy and yummy. Always order extra pita. I typically order a side order of Falafel as well. My BF would order his beef gyro which is also delicious. We had our kids so we order chicken shawarma for them which I had a taste and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. The kids favorite was the rice with it!!! I'm glad we have added another place for us as our "Go To" place!!!

I waited a little too long for having an appointment. I wouldn't have mind waiting but it was a tad too long. I was trying to be understanding since holiday is coming up. What annoyed me more was that someone who was late got seated & started on right away. The reason why I knew she was late - she apologized for being so late right off the bat! Meanwhile the lady that the guy was already assisting stopped what he was doing and asked one of the other girls to finish the lady so he can attend his late client. I get that they're regulars but it's not ok to have everyone else wait because your regular client was late. So that was a bit annoying. The girls that worked there I think are trained to say "thank you for waiting" which is a nice gesture because a lot of us waited. Although I didn't feel rushed even tho I was there close to 7:30....granted I had an appointment at 5. And I got there 5 minutes early too. Finally when I was seated on the chair while my feet were soaking in the water it was 5:19 and sat there for about 15 minutes before anyone started the actual pedi.  Both my pedi & mani experience itself was nice.  I will say I am in love with my 4th of July manicure. The girl that worked on my hands is super talented (wished I remembered to ask her name). I showed her the photos. She was very meticulous and took her time which I truly appreciated. I tipped both girls $10 each...I would say that's a nice gesture on my end.

I ordered their MVPita sampler and added extra meat (Shish Kabob) to my sampler and 2 Baklava to go. When I called in to order my food, I was warned they were busy with a party at their restaurant. I was on hold for almost 5 minutes. The staff who answered the phone and the second staff who took my order were both very apologetic about it, which I can appreciate. Went in to grab my food, I was greeted right away. The place was nice and clean. They had 1 cook and looks like 3 waitresses working. I paid for my to go items and noticed that I wasn't charged for my extra meat and only 1 Baklava was on the receipt (I got a FREE Baklava because I checked in) so I checked with the staff if that was correct. She checked and said she did order me my extra meat and will make sure I get my 2 Baklava. Not only did I get 2, she hooked me up with 3! That was a great surprise! The food I ordered was missing a couple things - it states on the menu for their sampler that you get Hummus, Gyro, Chicken Shawarma, and Falafel. Served with pita. I would assume the Chicken Shawarma should have been a gyro? But I didn't get that. Instead I got Hummus, Chicken Shawarma, Falafel and my extra meat of Shish Kabob. I didn't get a Gyro nor my Pita. The Chicken Shawarma was ok - it was too lemony for my taste. On the other hand, the Kabob was delicious and well marinated and tender. The Fallafel was a little too dry and the Baklava was good but have had better - it was too sticky. I think too much syrup. It should be fluffy and not too gooey. I'm rooting for this plAce and will definitely come back another time and try it out again. Thanks for great customer service!!!
