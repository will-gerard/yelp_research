Total... service... breakdown!  I waited the obligatory 30 minutes on a Friday night so that my 2 boys and I could duck in for dinner (the make-your-own pizza is a kids favorite). When our buzzer buzzed, I took it up and the gentleman at the front said it must have malfunctioned.  My BS meter went to 10 as we waited for another 10 minutes for a seat.  Once seated, the waitress took a ton of time to get our order, and then for some inexplicable reason didn't enter our order until the first kids meal came out to the table - spanning at least 45 minutes from sitting to serving.  Maybe it was a bad night, I could hear constant service and kitchen screw-ups from the party of 10 behind us.  Food quality was bad on top of this... burger bun was hard, pizza dough was crusty *before* they cooked it as my son was making his pizza... the only thing they didn't screw up was my beer.      Although the wait is comporable, I will pick Yard House at the other end of Desert Ridge next time.  I'll stick to Rock Bottom on the West side at Arrowhead, which has never let me down.

My go-to breakfast spot is on my way to work, but location is not the only plus with Hot Bagels. Yes, the bagels are hot and fresh as you'd expect.  But they're also frickin' huge.  Hold one next to any other bagel and you'll see the difference.  Although my wife claims the bagels are too salty, I have always been pleased.  And the family frequently gets a dozen on the weekend. Sweet Kona Blend coffee seals the deal, indeed this place is HOT!

This place has been around forever.  So long in fact that I still recognize some of the 80's and 90's faces in the photos that make up the tabletops.  Of course, the owner always stocks the counter with fresh faces from the surrounding high schools.  Food is good, beats the pants off of Subway.  Bread is made fresh, and veggies are always fresh.  I love the use of Italian dressing on the house special subs.  Make sure to get a Capin' Cooler and take advantage of the inexpensive sub-drink special.  When I first started visiting Captain Bills at age 10, there were so many bumper stickers on the walls that I didn't understand.  I would wonder what my Dad was laughing at.  As my sense of humor developed through puberty, I certainly appreciated a great many more.  The decor of Captain Bills was definitely a major influence on my sense of humor.  Today, my 10 year old asks me what's so funny about some of the bumper stickers when we visit... ah, innocence.  Classic joint, good food, great prices, and a delightful decor.

Cafe Rumba has become our family's go-to quick dinner option.  The baja mexican menu features great fresh tacos, enchiladas, burritos and salads, cooked right in front of you and customized with various fresh toppings.  My favorite is the pineapple salsa. The menu tops out at $7.99, and you can usually find a coupon, so the whole family can eat for a reasonable price.  There's a quesadilla kids meal too!  Mix in an inexpensive margarita for dad, and the whole family leaves happy every time.

A '94 Rocket myself, I heard a good buzz about this place from folks in the old 'hood.  I brought my two little burger critics with me as well (ages 10 and 12).  Lots of soda to choose from, great hamburgers, and delicious fries.  It beats the heck out of a chain burger place in quality and character.  I even ordered the "Rocket Burger" which is a ridiculous three-patty monstrosity on a 10-inch sub roll.  I was embarrassed in front of my kids because I couldn't even finish my fries.  Rocket Burger has the makings to be a classic joint, legendary if they can match Capin' Bills longevity!

Working nearby the AZ Center, I often end up there for lunch.  So I was sad to see one of my favorite joints, Uno, go belly up.  It's replacement, Brick, is a good improvement though.  I'm not big on the hipster vibe, I think they're trying a little too hard to be cool.  The Pizza is so-so and the prices are on the low side of reasonable.  Two things I really like about Brick are the Beer and Burgers.  They have Spaten Oktoberfest on tap (best beer ever!) as well as a good line-up of Four Peaks beers.  The Burger is of special distinction.  It's the best burger in Downtown by far.  The burger is huge and hand-patted.  Order it medium rare for maximum enjoyment.  It has the perfect fat/meat ratio and some of the best flavor I've tasted in any burger anywhere.  The bun is soft and a perfect compliment to the patty.  They also put "pork belly" on it (essentially bacon).  It's just awesome!  Match the burger with a beer at lunch for about $15 with a tip and it's just about perfect.

I grew up enamored of the original location located at I-17 and Cactus.  It was my family's go-to Chinese eatery in the 80's and 90's, we'd eat there every couple of months. Even though I moved out of the neighborhood, I'd hit Shangri-La for lunch every so often in the last decade while I was nearby on errands.  A couple of weeks ago, I saw a "Shangri-La" sign go up at the new location a few blocks from my home at 59th and Union Hills, and figured it was a long shot that it was related to the place I knew and loved.  But last week I walked in and instantly recognized the hostess who was at the old location for at least 20 years.  We had a brief chat and she explained that the owners of the old location sold the business to another family and have opened this new location.   I brought my son in for lunch today and was happy to see the same good food at bargain prices with awesome service.  The only thing the new location lacks is the dated decor and the duct tape on the seats.  The interior of the new location is modern without being too stuffy, with a hypnotizing bubble display as you walk in (you'll know it when you see it). Presentation of the food was better than I remember at the old place, but quality and taste are the same... even the great tea!

I've visited The Counter twice, and won't again.  My first visit I dropped $15 on a burger and fries... plus a tip.  The burger was OK, but there are definitely better burgers in Downtown Phoenix (i.e. 1130 in the AZ Center).  On my second visit I took my daughter for a celebratory milkshake after her music audition.  The shakes were just OK, and pricey.  What's worse, when I looked at my bank statement, the charge was different than I remember approving - with a $6 tip on a $15 purchase!  I like to think I'm a generous tipper, but this was certainly fraud.  I called to resolve the issue, and was asked to come in and talk to a manager.  When I came in one slow afternoon (total of 5 people were eating at the time), I waited to speak with a manager for over 15 minutes - the whole time with a server letting me know every few minutes that the manager would "be with me in a minute".  I finally left my business card with a note to call or email me.  I'm not surprised I haven't heard back.  I won't be going back to The Counter anytime soon but not solely because of this bad experience.  Instead of eating overpriced yet mediocre burger and shakes at The Counter, walk across the street to 5 Guys in CityScape or Coney Island on Monroe to save a few bucks for a better burger.

I wandered in on a morning walk through Downtown Phoenix, entering to a delightful greeting by the manager Andy. It was a slow time so I chatted with Andy while sipping a cup of straight-up black coffee.  The coffee was smooth and tasty, clearly not Starbucks.  Turns out that Andy has quite a few years of experience in the coffee business and really knows what the heck he's doing.  He roasts his own beans next door in one of the quaint historic cottages he gutted and refurbished - like the one now home to Street Coffee.  I bought some fresh-roasted beans for home for a very reasonable price. As Arnold says "I'll be back!"
