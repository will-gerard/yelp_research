We were originally planning on eating lunch at Bandera but they only opened for dinner. So we were walking north and walked by Italian Grotto.   I wish we didn't eat here.    The ambience was very dark and smelled of sanitation. The restaurant just smelled old and rank.   The food was terrible. The salad had old pieces of red cabbage, the dressing was sour and vinegary. The minestrone soup tastes like leather. The entrees were huge, and for the price they should be. However. The quality was so low and I smelled my fishy pasta from when the server came out of the kitchen. I had a seafood medley of 1 large old shrimp, 1 ok scallop, a bunch of old clams and mussels that smelled and tasted terrible, and calamari that was ok. The pasta noodles were fine however, the quality did not match the price.  I think this establishment needs to really refocus and read all these reviews and make a change. Italian Grotto is in the heart of old town, and people from other states and countries come to eat here and leave with a bad impression of AZ.  This place needs a major revamp and as is, this restaurant should not serve to the public.

Every time I get a craving for Indian food, The Dhaba always satisfies. With the intimate environment, great food and great service, The Dhaba was a great experience.   My wife and I had their lunch special and was provided a full course meal for a great bargain. The meal started with a fresh salad. I ordered the lamb and it was tasty and didn't have the smell that most other Indian restaurants have I. Their lamb dishes. The sauce and garlic naan was delicious. My wife had the chicken tikka masala and that was great as well. To top off the meal was a clean rice pudding that refreshed the palate. Highly recommended.

ALERT! New owner and new management.  First off, we went to Sun tonight for the 5.99 noodle special.  We went around 7 pm.  There was 1 table that was just finishing up.  After that table left, we were the only table.  We had 6 adults and 1 child.  We ordered (1) Kung Pao Shrimp, (4) noodle specials, (2) black bean noodles, and (1) Vegetable and Rice Platter.   We were given our drinks first.  The water was horrendous.  I remember that they used to serve filtered water and it tasted great.  I believe the new owners probably didn't see the need for filtered water and just used straight up Chandler tap water.   Anyways, we sat for 1 hour until our first dishes came out.  The Kung Pao Shrimp and Vegetable Rice Platter.  The Kung Pao Shrimp is usually not deep fried, but the outer portion was not even crispy.  The sauce was bland and the vegetables were old.  The onions and bell peppers tasted so old.  The Vegetable Rice Platter was just deep fried rice, vegetable assortment and mushrooms and whatever they felt like they needed to throw away.  The mushrooms especially were just gross!    We waited another 15-20 minutes for the Noodles to come out.  The black bean noodles were disgusting.  The sauce had so much corn starch and salt that it was unbearable.  The prior owners made the noodles very good, but usually the sauce was watery.  However the new owners put more starch and more salt and it was just unbearable.  The best thing that came out was the noodle special because everything else tasted so terrible and it was the cheapest thing.    Even though we sat there no waitress came by or even acknowledged what was going on.  In addition, there were probably 3-4 tables in there tops.  My father asked why everything took so long and the waitress just said that there were so many orders.  And we asked them to just take a look around the restaurant.  She just apologized repeatedly.   Then when we got our bill, they took the liberty to tack on the 18% gratuity on top of our bill.  We only had 6 adults and 1 child!.  We went in for the 5.99 special and came out with a over 100 dollar tab.    I just got home and needed to write this in order to let people know not to waste their money.  It's the same look, but everything is terribly wrong here.  It will probably go out of business if they don't take notice of what's going on.  I'm just praying that I don't get food poisoning.

Our children's doctor was awesome even though we saw him about 5 minutes at most per visit. Whereas their nurses and front office people are the most rude and disgruntled employees I have ever seen. I don't understand how they could treat children so poorly. They could at least smile, but they look so mad all the time.  The front office workers were the worst. We had issues with billing and insurance but that was all taken care of but they continually send notices that the bill will go to collections. This office should really analyze their front office and see why patients are leaving. We won't be going back.

Samir is the man.  This place is awesome.  The food is amazing and well worth the price.  Right in front of lifetime fitness, I love just going after Saturday morning ball, and just eating a refreshing salad, or pita wrap.    All of their chicken is made to order, and is never dry or rough.  It's so tender and juicy and makes your mouth water every time I think of it.  I take a lot of friends there too and they are hooked.  Pita Di Vita beats out all med restaurants in the valley.

"Over" rated. Heard good things when it first opened but the service and the food are subpar. I will not be coming back to over easy.

My wife and I get Thai dessert whenever we are in the area. The snow and smoothies are amazing.  The service and quality are awesome and anytime we get a chance, we want to stop by and get a dessert.

Spent 30 minutes in the drive thru. No apology or anything. The shaved ice was half of what we get from the Mesa dr location. Not going to come to this location again.

I particularly enjoyed their Korean menu offerings.  I love the hwedup bap and kalbi tang.  Their sushi is very fresh and comes in large quantities to get full off of.  The nigiri sushi was the biggest I've ever seen, as the fish on top is the size of 2 orders at most other sushi restaurants.  Sushi and Korean food is always a A+ in my book.  Thankful to have found this place.
