Two stars. The items they carry are fantastic, however, the prices are sky high (although that doesn't mean that isn't room to bargain) and the staff is extremely unfriendly. I would rather shop on Ebay or go pay full price at Lumature or Design Within Reach.

Great food. The service could have been slightly better. I don't see why my drink should ever run dry when it's just a Coke. Best view of PHX in town. I would never go to Capital Grill or Ruth's Chris if I could get a reservation here.

The first time in my life that I had meat literally fall off the bone. I tried their steak, ribs and chicken. It was all fantastic!

I'll give them a 5 star in the context of what I was dealing with and my satisfaction with the outcome. I live in McCormick Ranch and often see dead rabbits in the road. It's sad, but it happens all the time. When walking to my mailbox I found an injured rabbit that was still very much alive. It's little heart was racing, but it couldn't move. I felt terrible for it and had no idea what to do. I moved it off the road and called this clinic. I explained the situation and expected to be rejected or hit with huge cost. The receptionist told me to bring the rabbit in and it wouldn't cost anything. I was so grateful that one way or another they would help with this animal's suffering. Unfortunately it died on the drive there so I cannot comment on how things would have played out otherwise. They took the animal from me and properly disposed of it. I can't imagine what I would have done without their help.

Full disclosure, I have not purchases anything from PHX Metro Retro, however, I love the place and certainly will buy once the right item comes through their doors. I know what I'm looking for and while I play the waiting game I'm more than happy to pop in once or twice a month to see what's new. The place is great.  Heidi and Doug have always been great to talk to. I see them as stewards of the PHX modern/retro community. They love to share their knowledge and have always been super friendly.

If the food is marginal you would at least expect the service to be exceptional. It isn't.   I'll put up with decent service for great food or decent food for great service, but when you don't get either one what's the point in going?

I went for the first time with some folks from work to play ping pong. the place was fun, service was great, food was great and the other customers were cool when the occasional ping pong ball landed on their table. Everyone in the place seemed to be enjoying themselves.

Great food and service. Normally a wait on the weekend, but what would you expect.

I'm surprised to read all of these negative reviews. I had a great experience with this company.   Yesterday my Grand Cherokee blow two tires when I was on an unimproved road exploring and old mine west of Phoenix. I was in the middle of nowhere. AAA wouldn't recover my Jeep and recommend Charity. The driver arrived ASAP and had ice-cold water for me, which was great because I had run out 4-5 hours earlier after hiking in the 100+ heat. The driver, Chuck, and I talked for over an hour on the trip back to Phoenix about family, friends, hobbies, failure, success...life.   When I was stuck in the middle of nowhere (alone) these guys helped me. Based on my experience I would recommend them and use them again.   Thanks to AAA for the referral
