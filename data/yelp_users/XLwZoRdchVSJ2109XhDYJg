I'm a regular here and always get the Beef Udon. This time i tried to have shrimp addon to the regular. They told me 1 tempura shrimp is $1 extra. Then girl asked me if i want the tempura or the regular shrimp. I ordered the regular boiled shrimp thinking i would get more, turned out i got only ONE boiled shrimp in my entire bowl. I tried to talk to the staffs and get the same answer: that's the pricing and only the owner can change it. And they really had attitude when explaining this to me. I dont know but it is pretty clear 1 tempura shrimp is more than 1 regular boiled shrimp. Either the staffs need to learn their pricing right or the owner needs to rethink the pricing. Wont return in the near future.

I came in with 6 people and ordered Chicken Sausage slider. The cups for water were all wet and looked dirty, the place also was swarmed with flies. Everyone got their food except me. So I know they might have forgot my order. I talked to the cashier girl who got my order to check if they do. She comfirmed they're making it so i continue to wait. After everyone done eating, my order still hasnt come. I checked with the cashier girl again and she finally said the kitchen staff lost my order. I gave this place 2 stars since the manager was decent enough to get my order to-go with an extra apple pie and get me a refund as I demanded. I highly doubt that I would ever come back here again.
