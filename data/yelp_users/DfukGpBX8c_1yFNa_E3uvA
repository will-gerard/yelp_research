FRIED SALT AND PEPPER LOBSTER! LITERALLY THE BEST DISH I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!! ONLY $15  Diamonds is as Authentic as it gets with great food, poor service and hidden Asian menu that you have to ask for.   If your looking for good or speedy service look elsewhere. But for amazing and cheap authentic Chinese/ Vietnamese dishes you found your spot (just be pre-paired to wait 15-30 min for food)  My fav dish is deep fried lobster for the beautiful price of $15 (ask for salt and pepper lobster) that is fresh from tank and cooked when ordered. It is the best dish with an amazing taste!  Best dishes: salt pepper lobster ginger crab steamed fish duck pork with skin  if you get Asian menu look on back for combination's you can get  claims lobster steamed fish pork rice   all for $35

it was not bad but not good. I found that it was overpriced and a much more appetizing read than eat.  For appitizer we got chorizo app which was just a quesidilla with chorizo that was cut in half that cost $8. It was good but not $8 good.   For dinner I ordered Lamb Shank that was like $15 which had great flavor but I was only served like 5 small super tiny pieces of lamb that where over cooked.  For dessert I ordered a crape which came out cold  I was not impressed with the place or the food.  Service was great but in my opinion not worth it.

I am Thai and very picky and very rarely do i go out for Thai food because I tend to be disappointed and feel that I paied way to much.   That is not the case with lemon grass cafe. I got a strong craving for Thai food and was much to lazy to cook so i dared to try it. It is as authentic as it gets. All Thai cooks relatively cheap price and environment that reminds me of Thailand

Beautiful relaxing atmosphere to match the good vibes of people that work there. Alex took her time making me feel comfortable and making sure i felt and looked beautiful! I love that they use all natural products and my hair stayed in place and looked great without having to be weighed down by hair spray.  I was very happy with visit to Abloom Salon

CALZONIE!! I love clock work pizza! me and my co-worker have Fri-zone day where we eat a calzone every fri. A large calzone for $9 feeds us both and we are more than stuffed and normally have a piece or two to give out.   Word of advice ask for extra butter and garlic on top and it will be perfect!  top it off with a piece of chocolate moose cake  wham bam perfect combo for an amazing Friday lunch
