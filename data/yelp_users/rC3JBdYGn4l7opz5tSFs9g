Since moving to Arizona I have selected Fry's as my new grocer and am very happy with my choice! I immediately signed up for their VIP card and love seeing the many savings listed on the receipt after every trip.  I am especially happy that I have moved closer to this Frys as it is open 24 hours and even when shopping in the wee hours of the morning can expect to see some nocturnal ASU students.  Any interactions I have had with the staff have been pleasant and enjoyable.

I love heading out to the Cue Club on weekend nights! While the line out front may scare away some potential customers, the wait always seems to fly by. Every time I've been to the Cue Club my group has been able to make new friends. Even while often packed, it has never taken me too long to get a order a drink at the bar. In the back it seems like have enough pool tables and space for people to get a few games in without being bumped around too much as there is only a few tables affected by the men's bathroom crowd.

This is my favorite Starbucks location! Even when living miles down the road in Mesa, I would drive out of my way to frequent this location. The staff is very friendly and never misses a beat, they even have gotten my order memorized. There is always more than enough space to sit down and get any work or reading done and usually prime space around the electrical sockets.

Since my first Sprinkles experience in Newport Beach, CA I've been addicted. Unfortantely for me I was attending school in Iowa where I experienced severe Sprinkles withdrawal. After graduating one of the major advantages while debating packing up and moving to Arizona was being within a few short miles of Sprinkles. No lie.  The staff is friendly and are always welcoming. After becoming a regular the staff has even begun to remember cupcake preferences and are helpful in suggesting new flavors.  The cupcakes are amazing. Everyone I introduce to Sprinkles becomes instantly as addicted as I had on my visit to Newport Beach. I have even found myself anxiously awaiting the various seasonal cupcakes they introduce each month.  Watch out for the lines sometimes, primarily on weekends and when certain events attract visitors to the Phoenix area. However, the staff seems prepared for such a demand and works quickly and efficiently to help everyone as fast as possible.

The Lucky Strike has been our go-to to kick off nights downtown. The atmosphere and crowd are very fun. The bartenders were very friendly when I asked about a new drink recommendation and the waitresses were very prompt and kept a good eye on my party. The DJ was great as many of us noted were noting through the night the good mix of music being played. I have yet to have had any complaints about my time here!

The service could have been a better and this is coming from someone pretty empathetic with service professionals. It was taking a long time for our drink orders to show up, but our server was very friendly. The food was alright. I'll certainly be giving it a second chance.
