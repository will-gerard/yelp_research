I'm picky, but I've found that there are two things Tia Rosa's does really well:  their chile rellenos, and also anything with beef in it. their chile rellenos are non-traditional, almost, I would say, New Mexico style, but they are now my favorite rellenos anywhere. and the beef comes out nice and tender and flavorful. I would highly recommend this place, but it does get crowded on weekends (way crowded!). I try to go for lunch. :)

Unlimited Coffee stays open late, until midnight on weeknights, which is how my friend and I found ourselves there. Located in what appears to be a Pizza Hut building from the 70s (recycling at its best!), Unlimited Coffee has a pretty decent size parking lot (which is important if you happen to want to hang out with friends and their cars in the parking lot after loading up on coffee).  First thing I noticed was the gelato; at least twelve flavors are presented, possibly sixteen, and the staff is quick to offer samples. I selected the chocolate chip. My companion chose chocolate hazelnut, which was a big standout. Both very good, really thick and creamy, so creamy it was almost like an ice cream. The "kitty size", a.k.a. small, was plenty for a snack.  Unlimited coffee offers normal boring tables and chairs, free wi-fi, and huge puffy, comfy couches, which are what we gravitated toward (even if they need to be cleaned a bit).  Oh, and the coffee was good too. ;)

The fish was mediocre at best. For Nigiri, we ordered salmon, albacore, and fresh water eel. First, they gave us fatty tuna (best guess) instead of albacore. After we complained, they brought the albacore. The eel was quite bland. The salmon bordered on inedible. The rolls were competent, but nothing spectacular. The vegas roll was good, but the rainbow roll was flavorless.   the squid salad was by far the best thing we had here; in fact, the only thing I would say that was actually good!  the worst things were a tie; our waitress was terrible. there was only one other party in the entire restaurant while we were there, and the waitress was still completely inattentive.  The other half of the tie was the edamame. Someone else got to ours first; a member of my party found a maggot in her edamame! This is where the wait staff fell apart. They didn't even apologize, and didn't take it away. I had to get up and carry the edamame dishes up to the sushi bar so they wouldn't be sitting on our table! They took the edamame off the bill, but that was it.  we should have left right then, but I had heard such good things about this place, I really wanted to try the fish. what a waste of time. Needless to say, I will never again be patronizing this joint.

Wow! you must have the Savannah Marie double IPA. it's one of my top-three beers! great appetizers, especially the pig ears (order them extra crispy!). the pork belly and the short rib sliders are amazing!
