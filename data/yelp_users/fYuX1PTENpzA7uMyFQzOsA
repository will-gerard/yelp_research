Growing up in Phoenix, Karsh's was the only "Jewish" bakery in town. Back in the day, Phoenix was small and the Jewish community was tight knit (or so my memory goes-TBI on Thomas anyone?) so all of the parties, Shivas, Bris's, Oneg's, (you get the picture) had something or many somethings from this bakery. I don't know about the changes in ownership or any of ins and outs of the business here,  but I have always have had a fondness for their marble rye-which I lovingly referred to as "zebra bread". In fact, their rye bread in general has been my gold standard for years and years.  Now that I live in the Bay Area, whenever I come to town, I knew I would get my deli fix at Miracle Mile(the only Jewish style deli on the West side of town and sadly now closed) and I knew my hot pastrami would always be perfect because they used Karsh's rye bread.   On my visit in January and on the way to Sun City from the airport, I had my Mom (Grandma in tow) take me to Scott's Generations (next door and review to follow) and after a disappointing meal there and an obvious lack of using Karsh's rye for my sandwich, I asked Mom to get a loaf of "zebra bread" for me to eat at her house (best way is toasted with cream cheese and strawberry or raspberry jam). Within minutes (while I was escorting Grandma to the car), she came out with the loaf of rye and a very memorable pink box with a round chocolate chip cake thing that I never can remember the name of that tastes delicious with a steaming cup of Peet's Garuda blend (I brought the Bay Area with me of course)!  I think when my Mom comes to visit next month I will ask her to bring a couple of loaves of zebra bread. I may actually break my vow to never ever freeze bread (those of you with a Jewish Grandma might know why)...

A Jewish girl walks into a (oh, wait, I am writing a restaurant review and not a J.A.P. joke)....  When Scott's first opened many years ago, it was really good and had a lot more competition than it does now. In those days, there was Katz Deli, several Miracle Mile locations, Chompie's and a few other ill fated places (anyone remember Hollywood Deli?). I currently live in one of the best food meccas of the West Coast and can't get really good Jewish deli (Saul's is not great folks, and no, I have not tried Miller's yet).   When Mom and Grandma picked me up from the airport, I had suggested we stop at Scott's to give them a try on the way to Sun City. None of us had been there in several years and I was really excited at a prospect for a delicious hot pastrami sandwich on rye. We got there, walked in and I noticed that the place itself looked a bit run down and dare I say, a little dirty? The owners are the same but the guy behind the counter who used to be friendly and Hamish just sat there like a schlub. We were directed to a table, and I immediately noticed how large their menu was. I ordered my sandwich sadly assuming that my regular hot pastrami would be (a) HOT and (b) on Karsh's rye since Karsh's is right next door. Neither was the case when my sandwich arrived and the pastrami was not delicious and I asked the waitress if I was mistakenly given the "lean" type of pastrami and she said I was not. Mom had a tongue sandwich and thought it was "okay" but she is not as picky (bitchy) as I am and Grandma had blintzes which did not look homemade but that of the frozen variety (I hope I am wrong here). Service was fair. Not warm and not quite the NY attitude that passes in these types of establishments.  After our experience I will no longer suggest Scott's and will have them drive directly to Chompie's.

Another morbid mortuary review.   I have been to this Sinai many times as this is the Jewish mortuary in Phoenix and they have handled many of my family member's funerals, etc. This is not a fun nor easy process for anyone and since I had to use Sinai in Lafayette to help me coordinate it was a better process than I could have anticipated.   There is something about 6 degrees of separation, but I have longed joked that in the Jewish community, there is usually a 2 degree separation if you get down to it.   The Sinai's (not the same business but have affiliation as do most if not all Jewish Mortuaries), did most of the coordination behind the scenes between CA and AZ. Getting my Grandmother's body to AZ and given the Jewish Holiday that could have prevented some timeline stuff, I was worried. My family lucked out that everyone worked together seamlessly and I flew in to Phoenix, met my Mother and Mark at Sinai and made the arrangements.   My Gram was buried next to my Grandfather and Sinai took care of everything from the police escort(my Gram would have loved knowing all traffic was stopped for her) to the ensuring her obituary was in the paper, etc. There were few decisions we had to make (luckily we were aware of my Gram's wishes) and though this is not a business that is fun to review, it is important to know that businesses like this exist.

I know this is a chain and found that there is one in SF. We ended up coming here for a late lunch after picking up the husband and daughter from the airport when they flew into Phoenix to celebrate my Gram's 90th. My mom had yet to come here and the fact that this used to be Houston's which used to be located across the street which well, everything that once was has changed in Phoenix.   My mom ordered the artichoke and claimed it was one of the best she ever had. I had one of the best house side salads ever. It had all sorts of goodies from beets to goat cheese to hidden gems of avocado. Perfect. The husband had a French Dip he said he would fly back to have again and the DD ordered seared Ahi (she is much more adventurous than I) and loved it.   Service was friendly, we left full and I look forward to another experience with Hillstone.

My friend from high school picked me up from the airport and after a bit of discussion on where to have lunch she suggested we come here due to good experiences she had in the past. It is located in her old neighborhood in part of a strip shopping center that also houses a chain grocery store, a bar and some other shops.   When we arrived at the restaurant around 1pm on a Friday, the place was completely empty. This to me is never a good sign. I bit my tongue (out of respect for my friend) and we were seated by a nice enough waitress who was a bit needy seeming (could be due to the lack of customers). The owner was at one side of the restaurant on his laptop and there was one other person working in the kitchen.  After taking our drink order, the waitress then told us what was "good" and what she liked. I hate that. I hate unsolicited opinions especially around food. Oh well. My friend loves hummus so we ordered that to start. As I looked at the menu I found a lot of items to be the same with a little switch around of ingredients. I also found it strange that the gyros were beef only but made in house. Okay, fine-I will have lamb elsewhere. I couldn't decide what to order and when the waitress came back with the hummus, I asked if they made wraps (I wanted falafel but in pita with feta, etc. but no rice). She said they had wraps and she would get us a lunch menu. WTF? 1pm on a Friday and she gives us the dinner menu because it is more expensive and there were no other customers? Tre' tacky my dear, tacky.  I ordered the falafel wrap and had to add feta as it did not come in the wrap. I asked if they had avocado and was told they did not have any. My friend had the gyros combination plate (off the lunch menu which was $4.00 cheaper than the dinner menu) and it came with salad, rice and pita bread.   The hummus was ok. It needed to be a bit creamier and needed a bit more flavor. Toni's is way better as is the hummus from Trader Joe's. Oh well.   Our lunches arrived. My wrap had 3 big flat softish falafels. They were definitely made in house and could have been fried a little longer as they fell apart to mush. They were overly seasoned with a heavy hand of cumin. The feta and yogurt sauce were the saving grace, but I was finished after a literal 2 bites. The gyros on my friend's plate were okay-tender but lacked anything special. The rice was bland and white with a sprinkling of paprika on top for color. Meh.    Our waitress came back to check on us- a lot. Asked did we like the hummus, how was the falafel, tea, rice-anything to make contact. I was put off by her and the food so I did not respond and let my friend do all the talking.   The only saving grace to this experience was that I was with my friend and when I am with her, nothing else really matters all that much.  Needless to say, yes I am a Bay Area food snob and no, I would not come back here nor do I recommend it.

I have long been a fan of AJ's and lucky for me, they didn't open a location on the West Side of town until after I moved back to California. If they had, I would have been more broke then I was as a single working mother.  The daughter and I stopped in before her hair appointment for some coffee and pastries and then I came back in once her hair was getting done. The first thing I did was order some iced tea from their coffee counter. It was absolutely delicious iced tea and very reasonably priced. I want that tea now, I think it was pineapple or something yummy.   I perused around the store, picking up some Goldwater Salsa and a stuffed Cornish game hen to cook later in the day for my Grandma from the butcher counter. I was thrilled that they still had the stuffed fresh hens for the same price I used to pay $4.99. Something inflation hadn't touched.I also picked up some huge honey crisp apples (something again Grandma can afford but won't buy for herself) and a small bunch of flowers for her.   Next time I am in town, I am going to hit up AJ's right away for some iced tea!

I have visited this TJ's several times and it shares the same parking lot as Smart and Final. As far as TJ"s go, this one is pretty decent but the space between the aisles and the checkout stands are minimal and can get frustrating especially since this location is as close to Sun City as it is.   Since this is AZ, there is no such thing as two buck chuck...it is three buck chuck and yes, Grandma knows that this is the one thing I can get cheaper in California!  Thanks for being around TJ's and for providing some of the comforts and staples from home!

I have to upgrade this place a star due to dealing with the Sun City crowd, let alone my Grandmother! This RL location is close to where both my Mom and Grandma live and as far as chain restaurants go, is pretty consistent where everyone can find something they like to eat.   When we stayed a couple of nights in August, we came here as a family (husband, daughter, mom, G-ma and one other) and my Grandma arrived with the other party and lo and behold, she had forgotten her teeth at home! Our waitress was very understanding and suggested a couple of soft things for my Grandma to try. Needless to say, no one left hungry and Grandma like the lobster stuffed mushrooms she ordered and some of the shrimp pasta that came with my meal.   Just recently, I was in Phoenix for a couple of nights before heading to Tucson for my cousin's wedding. Since my mom was working on my first night there, I asked my Grandma where she wanted to go for dinner letting her know I was not interested in her other "favorite" Elephant Bar, so this is where she chose to go. It was a Thursday night around 5:30 (late for her) and we were seated right away(there was a huge wait by the time we left). I made sure Grandma had everything she needed before leaving (including her teeth which we now joke about) and after debating the menu choices, decided that I would order the "Endless Shrimp" (knowing she would eat the salad and some of the shrimp that came with it) and she ordered  the lobster pizza. The rolls of course are the main draw for me at RL, and I was good and only devoured one! Grandma took one bite of the lobster pizza and decided she didn't like it and sent it back and ordered the lobster mushrooms she had enjoyed in August. While waiting for those, she ate the salad and some of my fried shrimp and some really tasty and very fattening shrimp pasta thing. When her mushrooms arrived, she decided she was no longer really hungry, took one bite and sent those back too!   Our waiter was great. I mean super great. When she advised it was her 87th birthday (her actual b-day was about a week away) he asked what dessert she would like "on the house". He ended up comping us a dessert and took both the pizza and mushrooms off the bill. I tipped him HUGE for all of his patience and accommodations and seriously wanted to hug him for being so great. All in all, this must be my favorite RL location and I am grateful for the times I get to spend with my Grandma!

As a creature of habit or maybe a new tradtion, Mom, Grandma and I had dinner here my first night in Phoenix. Yes, Grandma had a coupon and yes, I tipped behind her, but the service and food were good and those cheddar biscuits are still the bomb.   Long live this RL location!

Route 44 cherry slushy with extra cherry juice at 9pm. Cost me $2.09 and such a treat it reminded me of I what state I was in!  Had the trip been any more stressful, I would have put a little (or a lot ) of vodka in it and then I would have more to say!  Nice service and great drink!

The daughter and I made another trip to Phoenix last week and we did what we always do while in AZ:  we tend to frequent a lot of chain restaurants and this is a chain that we had yet to try.  We came here with my Mom for a late lunch (after being picked up from the airport) around 2pm to a fairly empty restaurant. This place is land locked in between PF Chang's, Cheesecake Factory, Buco De Peppo, Elephant Bar, Red Robin and a slew of other fast and non fast food chains.   Our waitress was really nice and we were all glad we brought in sweatshirts because like all AZ restaurants, it was freezing inside. The menu had a lot of great offerings and my Mom and I both chose wood-fired grilled salmon served with perfectly al dente veggies and for me, Parmesan mashed potatoes and Mom's with a baked potato. Daughter opted for some kind of salad with stinky cheese and a cup of their tortilla soup. We were also served fresh baked sourdough bread with cornmeal crust that had Kevin been with us, would have been replenished many many times. The bread was AWESOME.   My salmon was cooked perfectly and was delicious. I was super pleased with my meal (it was huge for lunch and at $14.00 including the large helping of fresh vegetable was better than my favorite chain salmon that only comes with rice and 5 or 6 snow peas). The daughter LOVED her salad (I didn't taste it due to the stinky cheese) and the soup was flavorful but thick like the kind Chili's serves and not in a good way.   I would come back here in a heartbeat and avoid some of the other monstrosities  around.

My dear Yelp Friend Thomas S. will kill me for giving this place 4 stars, especially after I teased him for coming here a while ago however, once he (and you) read this review, you might forgive me.  I am here visiting my Mom, her husband and my Grandma. For those of you who follow my or Toni M.'s reviews, Toni is my step-mom, but she and my Dad have been together since I was 7 (almost 30 years now) and though I have never called her "mom" she and I are as close as I am to my real mom.  ANYWAY....  I was just in Disneyland where everything is close together and you get to choose which line you stand in. Same could be said for this area of Peoria. It is the land of chain restaurants. You name it, it is here. Applebee's (yep), Red Lobster (yep), Olive Garden (yep), PF, Cheesecake,the list goes on and on. Why Elephant Bar. well here are the reasons:  1. Mom, Husband and Grandma all have 20% off cards for being Sr. Citizens at the Elephant Bar (we are close to Sun City). 2. Grandma had a coupon (this is a running joke in our family btw). 3. Their food doesn't make Grandma sick (though she does complain half way through the meal that her food is cold and then gets a new meal to take home. 4. Big menu  5. Did I say Grandma had a coupon?  Anyway, we drove to town to surprise my mom and grandma. My mom just turned 60 and as a gesture for this milestone, she is having a Bat Mitvah at her synagogue. You see, back when she was turning 13, girls didn't go through this rite of passage. We showed up with out either she or Grandma knowing we were coming. We first came to mom's house (her husband knew) and then they picked up Grandma to meet us at the restaurant. My grandmother came through the door, looked right at me and said "You look just like my granddaughter". It took her a minute and when I stood up, she started to cry she was so happy (she is going to be 85 this year).  We had a great waitress who put up with my Grandma. That alone gets a lot of stars in my book. I had a delicious salad (Thai Salad), and everyone else was pleased with their meal (even if half way though Grandma's was cold).  I had been to this location before and it was ASS. This time, the service was great, I ordered well and was happy.   Now, tonight, we shall see what happens...it will be dinner at a local chain not a national one, so we shall see!!

All hail the Arizona cheese crisp and this instituation that has been around since 1970 still makes a great one.  This most recent trip to Phoenix for the Jewish New Year left me longing to visit my Grandfather's grave along with my Great Aunt Florence and my Great Uncle Marshall. In order to go to the cemetery, we have to go through what is now a "sketchy part of town" but a part that I used to be more familiar with when I was younger. Since we were going on our way to the airport, I suggested to my Mom that we go to LP for lunch so I could get my cheese crisp fix and see if my childhood memories of this place lived up.   The Synagogue I grew up going to was close to LP. La Pinata was the first "real" Mexican food restaurant I ate at and the only one my Grandparent's would go to since they never really cared for Mexican food but did like cheese crisps and chimichangas. My Great Uncle had his 50th birthday party here in 1976 and I was there. Yes, there is history.   Most importantly, when we arrived around 2pm on Saturday afternoon, there were mostly empty tables and the decor was the same as I remembered it. Our waiter was super nice, we ordered the cheese crisp and it came out crispy, and piping hot. For those of you who don't know what a cheese crisp is, imagine a giant tortilla topped with cheese then baked or put under a broiler for a few minutes and sliced in triangles like a pizza. It is awesome and something I make at home but it is not quite the same.   My mom ordered a spinach enchilada a la carte, I had a side of refried (lardy kind) beans and rice and the daughter had the lunch portion of steak fajitas (huge portion). Lunch menu is available M-Sat which is a very nice thing to know.   Is this the best Mexican food ever? No. Did the taste and my memory hold up? Yes. Will I be back-DEFINITELY!   Thank you La Pinata for being at least one thing that hasn't changed in Phoenix...

I was thrilled to be able to come to Fajitas for my friend's birthday lunch. This restaurant has been around for what seems like eons and a very fitting venue to celebrate the big 4-0! In fact, this place was a regular haunt of mine for years and I even had my 17th birthday party here (with my friend Kari the now 40 year old!).  We had a party of 16-Kari's family, her parents, siblings and their families. We were seated at a long table and the first thing I noticed is that the decor is exactly the same as it was since we were in high school. The menu changed a little bit, but the salsa and chips were the same too. We had a nice waitress, the iced tea was great and we ordered cheese crisps to start and as a table ordered beef, chicken and shrimp fajitas along with a couple of sides of guacamole.  The cheese crisps arrived first and were incredible. Ivy, if you are reading, this is a must have cheese crisp!Better than both Macayo's or Garcia's hands down. Light, crisp and fabulous. In fact I liked the cheese crisps better than the fajitas! The fajitas arrived, the shrimp had good flavor but were small and shriveled looking and obviously overcooked. The steak wasn't as good as I remember it and realized we didn't order the more expensive meat (cadillac) so that could be why. The chicken was perfectly cooked and really good. The tortillas are great-these have been around since before Chevy's hit the Phoenix area and I will admit the guacamole was delicious and quite the surprise. I was thrilled at how good the meal was and even more thrilled to be celebrating with my friend at a place that has so much history within our friendship.  For those of you who are Fajita's newbies-here is a warning. This is the type of restaurant that the food smell sticks to you inside and out. I knew we were coming here so I had planned on what to wear-even down to the bra I traveled in and knew I would be doing laundry before I packed to come home the next day. Yep, long running joke about Fajita burps, farts, and clothing and they are all true so beware! Years ago, they didn't have a product like Febreeze. Now that they do, makes eating here a lot easier!

This January trip was a bit daunting and my mom had asked that I pick up a headboard for her from Costco the morning I was leaving. Since I was having breakfast with a girlfriend close by, I decided I would check out this Costco instead of having to brave the one closer to Sun City again.   I arrived here close to opening time on a Sunday morning, easily found parking and didn't have to do any navigation through the Sun City crowd. Due to the largeness of the item I had to purchase, my friend met me here after breakfast and helped me lug the headboard onto the cart and waited with it while I brought the car to the front of the store. Luckily, a really nice worker loaded it in with no hassels.   This Costco location would have been a life saver for me when I worked in the area some almost 8+ years ago. I don't think they have a gas station but I didn't look down the other end of the parking lot. All I know is that I was able to get what I needed and able to get out in a jiffy.

So, I moved back to the Bay Area 6 years ago this week. Last week, I was in Phoenix and met with some friends from high school who I haven't seen in 9 and 11 years respectively. Our 20 year HS reunion is next month and since I am not going, decided we should have our own mini type reunion and this was a place easy enough for all of us to meet up. Yes this is a chain, and yes when in Phoenix I play the chain game.   When this restaurant was built, it was all the rage. I used to work for a company close by and this was the place we would go to for recognition type lunches, etc. The portions were huge, there was a salad bar (yep this seems eons ago) and service was great. There was always a line and if you showed up at dinner time, you had to be prepared for a 1+ hour wait. We all met at 6:30 on a Wednesday night. No line outside, no one waiting inside and we were seated immediately. This told me right away that either the economy has taken a real toll or that the Claim Jumper isn't jumping anymore.   We were seated and all just started gabbing away. We all had non alcoholic beverages and warned the waitress we would be there for the long haul with gabbing, etc. so if she needed us to leave so she could get more tables to let us know. Heads up folks visiting AZ from CA-any wait staff in AZ DOES NOT MAKE MINIMUM WAGE. They make around $4.25 an hour now (used to be $2.12) and have to depend on tips. This is why I find service in AZ to typically be stellar compared to service here.   They have a smaller menu than they used to and also offer smaller plates. We all had something different-me a spinach salad and a big ass baked potato. My friends had a chicken sandwich of sorts and the meatloaf with mashed potatoes. We were all satisfied and my friends each took part of their meal home. We also all shared a coffee ice cream mud pie. It didn't taste as good as I remembered it, but it was a nice end to the meal. The desserts are still larger than life and even with 3 women gabbing and noshing, we left about a third of it.   The waitress was great-the restaurant still never got busy and we ended up closing the place down (that would be 10pm)! The three of us then ended up sitting outside in front of the restaurant and gabbed and gabbed until well after midnight. It was a great evening and a nice place to have played catch up with old friends (none of us are 40 yet so they wouldn't like me calling them "old").   I drove back to my mom's and parked the car, took off my shoes and walked through the house on my tip toes. Kind of like how I used to come home in high school but I wasn't drunk or stoned...

Okay, so hard to believe I am the FTR of this Garcia's location since it has been here for eon's (and looks like it) and is still one of the staple restaurants around the Metro Center area that hasn't closed down or changed.   The food is the same as it has been for the last 15+ years. Decent, not great and sadly, the shredded beef in the taco I had tasted like it was boiled without any flavors or seasoning.   For those of you reading this review who have never been to Phoenix (Arizona at all in fact) you may not be aware of the greasy deliciousness called a cheese crisp. This is seriously where it is at pretty much all over the Valley. Garcia's does make a fine cheese crisp and for that, I am still grateful and willing to go.   The one good thing I can say is the restaurant still seems to have a hopping bar area with live music a few nights a week. Good for the happy hour crowd, but since I was there with my mom and a cousin for lunch, it didn't do anything for me knowing this.   Word of warning to ladies who need to potty while in the restaurant area...The bathroom is as old as the rest of the place. One toilet so if you drink a lot, be prepared to wait your turn.

A dear friend of mine turned 40 in January and her mother arranged for a get together to celebrate her birthday here. I was a little put off at the idea of a pool hall and when I looked up the location, I realized this had some other name when we were in high school and has been around for a long time.   The whole Metro Center area has changed a lot over the years. Back in the 80's it was a great place to cruise (when we weren't on Central Avenue), but I digress. I borrowed mom's car, drove from Sun City and arrived close to the start time of the get together. I have been friends with Kari since we were 15 and by coming to town for her birthday weekend, was able to see some women I hadn't seen since we finished high school(back in 1989, yeah I know....)  I had very low expectations and I was glad. The place is pretty run down but super low key. Had I been there for other reasons, I would have entered into one of their nightly poker tournaments, but I was there for other reasons. There was a small group of people for this shindig-around 15 at one point but really about 10 for the long haul. No one ended up playing pool, but there were tons of tables, along with darts and some video games. They had a great jukebox and we had a blast playing all sorts of music from several different decades. They offer food (no one ordered any), a full bar and lots of specials on beer. The cocktail waitresses were very nice but that could be because I tip very well, but it was fun.    This place could use a really good cleaning as I left smelling like something stale/moldy. Not such a good thing when only in town for the weekend with limited clothing. Thank you Febreeze!

Yep another chain and though I have eaten at many OG's over the years, have never been a huge fan.   Had lunch here on a Thursday with Gma, mom, and daughter towards the late side of the lunching hour. For some reason, there was a wait, and the dining room was crowded.   Long story short, 2 of us returned our meals as they were nasty. Breadsticks and salad are still good but unfilled iced tea, weird service, etc. makes this one chain we will never visit again while in the area.

I typically despise Home Depot, but when I needed some help figuring out their propane tank exchange system (it is different than in the Bay Area), I walked in and was assisted immediately(again, something different from my HD experiences at home).  My mom was with me, and we decided to check out their ceiling fans as the one in my Grandma's bedroom conked out and she had a list of requirements for a new one and even though at 89 she is quite internet savvy, she couldn't quite differentiate what was what.  Sadly, we left without a fan but did get mom her new propane tank (I am quite the cook and did not learn from mom) as she relies on the bbq for just about everything you can overcook :)  Mom also said I got the help I needed right away because I am tall, and under 60. Who knows, but I was glad to be in and out without any problems!

The man needed a dress shirt to go with the suit he brought for tonight's event and lo and behold, we spotted this place and didn't have to deal with Arrowhead Mall.  We walked in to a sea of young men getting fitted for their prom attire and a salesmen immediately approached us-grateful to see a few crows feet I am sure.  He was great-non pushy and helped us get a shirt and tie that was needed. He even steamed the shirt for us so we didn't have to deal with it ourselves.  $75.00 and not a single problem or waiting in line with all the "boys". Great service and EASY!!!

(Catching up on reviews from my last trip to Phoenix Oct. 19-22)  This salon is the epitome of a Senior Citizen salon. Yes, it is Sun City, so I wouldn't expect any differently, and their hours cater to seniors-open 8am-4pm M-Sat. It is a cash/check type only place and there is a nail salon connected to the shop as well.  Why am I writing a review for this place? Well, this is my Grandma's hair salon and she has a weekly appointment here. If I am in town when she has her appointment, I take her. I think I have taken her here 3 times now (twice this year) and have seen her hair after an appointment more times than I can count. They do "old lady hair" and they do it just fine for a reasonable price. Her beautician is very nice and low key.  The real reason I wanted to write a review for this place is that in late July, the appointment my Grandma had here saved her life. How? Well, there were two retired nurses getting their hair done at the same time and they noticed a wound on my Grandmother's ankle. My Grandma had a biopsy taken earlier in the week on a possible skin cancer and sure enough, it turned out to become infected with MRSA and landed her in the hospital for a week and in a rehabilitation center for 3 more.   Old lady hair do's or not, my Grandma is treated right here and at 88, here is where she will be every Saturday at 1pm.

This is a meat place close to Sun City so dinner at 5 last night was quite appropriate.   Dillon's is decent fresh food in a casual environment. Good for groups, efficient wait staff and big portions. The man was on a brisket kick and since this was a BBQ joint, figured he would try it. It is Kansas style and it was nice and tender BBQ-though not quite "smoked" and definitely sliced on a meat slicer.  The daughter had a pulled pork sandwich that was tender and delicious. The Grandmother had a brisket sandwich, there are other offerings as well-fried chicken, chicken fried steak, fish, etc. Salads are good as are the onion rings they ordered for appetizers. This is no BBQ joint. This is a family restaurant with decent food and decent service.  I am giving 4 stars again mostly due to the great service we have. For some reason, AZ is still ass backwards when it comes to recognizing waitstaff. They are not paid minimum wage (though I am not sure how this is legal). They make about $3.25 per hour from the establishment (this is up from $2.12 two years ago) and the rest is supposed to come out of tips. Any young person willing to work in the Sun City area and depend on tips and actually works really hard to get them deserves a whole star to themselves (oh and an extra tip behind the chintzy tippers in my family here).  Reservations are only taken for a party of 8 or more.

We managed to work our way through several hotels in order to get to our "final destination" where I was going to use my "free" $200 worth of slot credits at Casino Royale. Since we were walking through and saw $5.00 Let It Ride tables and $5.00 Black Jack tables, we decided to spend a bit of time here.   The tables and the dealers were worn out and not in a good way. I pretty much felt like this was a notch down from the Golden Nugget on Fremont Street and barely a step above The Plaza. Oh well, at least this place provided me with another place to Yelp!

The Wynn=I WIN!!!  The man and I wanted to check out this gorgeous hotel. It is gorgeous and we enjoyed walking around and taking in all the sites. Since we were new to the casino, we decided to sign up for their promotions card called RED which was toting sign up and get $10.00 worth of free slot play.  So, many of you know I am a girl who plays poker and other live action games. I do not typically play slots, but if I do, there is one type of slot I will play (Jackpot Party) and I will do the $0.25 draw poker machines. I decided to put $20 into a draw poker machine, bet the max $1.25 and kept hitting small stuff. My guy was off at another machine and when he finally found me (20 minutes later), and sat down next to me, I was about $40.00 up. Next thing I know, bam, I hit a royal flush and win the jackpot for the day which was about $1,100.00. Talk about fun luck! I then took that $10.00 free slot play to the Jackpot Party machine, put in their $10.00 and a $20.00 bill of mine and ended up cashing out of the $.05 machine for $230.00!   Long story short, I came home with just as much money as I left for Vegas with and I paid for all of our tips, taxis and misc. stuff with other winnings.   I love the Wynn!  I have lots and lots of reviews to write and cannot manage to do them all tonight. I am hitting some main points and must be honest, we did not stay here, this review is mainly for the casino and for the downstairs itself.

D.U.M.P.   Sticky floors and slot areas. The $200 worth of slot credits were for the promotional machines only and they were gross. I felt like I needed to bathe in Purell afterwards.   For this kind of sleeze, I would stick with Mermaids or Four Queens on Fremont Street.

Stayed at this hotel our last night in Vegas as it is my love's birthday. We were upgraded to a suite on the 29th floor over looking the Eiffel Tower, the pools and the water show at the Bellagio. The room itself was lovely. We had a dining area, a living room with plasma TV, 2 bathrooms(one with a shower and one with a large jacuzzi tub) and a large bedroom w/plasma TV. We were totally enthralled with our room and our view, but sadly, I cannot give it 5 stars for the following reasons:  -the bedding was old and getting threadbare-it kind of itched a bit at first. -the towels were also old. Not what I would expect for a suite that can go for over 3K per night. -no robes provided -light switches were strangely located and the lamp set-up near the bed was less than stellar.  We ordered room service for breakfast and while some things were wonderful(they brought the requested candle in the grapefruit), most of the food was generic and not nearly as good as the breakfasts we had at the Renaissance.   I would stay here again, especially in a suite overlooking everything again.

Update: After writing this review, I decided to contact customer relations at the hotel again. I spoke with a very nice representative "Lisa" who credited back $150 on my credit card-even she couldn't believe all of the notes on our account nor the fumes we had to deal with. They are also looking into other things for us so I am glad I called.  Upgrading to 2.5 stars and this review might go higher depending on what else happens. _____________________________ I had high expectations for this hotel-and even higher given the fact that we upgraded to a fancy pants suite to celebrate my 40th birthday. While the hotel lobby is beautiful and the poker room giant, the rest of our stay was just okay and I promise to post pictures of our room once I get around to it. We had some really nice service and some not so nice service given what happened here, and I will do my best to outline it.  -Check in time is supposed to be 4pm. Our plane was late and we arrived at 6pm to find out our suite (that had been booked since mid September) was not ready for us. We were offered a lesser suite on a lower floor, but it was a smoking floor so that was a "NO". We were then told they would have our kind of suite available in an hour so for inconvenience, we were offered free drinks at the bar (husband does not imbibe) and $100 food and beverage credit (not to include tips). We said that would be fine, brought our bags to the Valet area and went to look around a bit. As promised, an hour later, our room was ready and we had a suite on the 26th floor-all the way at the end of one hall.  Upon walking into our suite, we were blasted by the smell of what I thought was new paint. When the Bellman brought up our luggage, he advised us that this was a newly remodeled suite and that we were the first ones to stay in it. This is usually a good thing, but the smell was so overpowering I felt dizzy and like I would pass out. I called down to the front desk, was on hold for about 15 minutes (word to the wise-if a major rodeo is in town beware for lots of cowboys and no room availability). I was told the hotel was at capacity (7,000 rooms) and they would send housekeeping up to refresh the room with air freshener. Luckily, we didn't stay in the room that long and we did have a bedroom door that shut and we couldn't smell the fumes with the door closed.   The next morning, I woke up with a bit of a headache and at about 6:45am, I told the husband I was going to get coffee from Bouchon. First, I made a beeline for the front desk. -I let the front desk know about our room smell. Again, I was advised the hotel was at capacity and was credited another $50 towards food and beverage. I was told that they could have housekeeping come and ionize our room but it would be a 5 hour or so affair. I told them that was fine as we had planned on going to Caesar's for the day and would call when we were leaving the room. I also advised that the jets in our tub were not working properly, there were lightbulbs burned out in the light fixture over the dining room table and that the makeup mirror provided did not work. I was assured everything would be taken care of. - We were gone all day. Left the Venetian around 9:30 and arrived back around 3:30 with a full expectation our room would be better. When we returned, the ionizer was still going full blast and whilst the bed had been made and the towels and ammenaties replenished, the bathroom was still not cleaned, lightbulbs still not replaced, etc. etc. I called down to the front desk and was on hold for about 20 minutes and was finally connected to a "manager". At this point, we were running short on time as we had dinner plans with a couple of my friends and my Mom and her friend before we had tickets to see Jersey Boys. I was advised by this manager that they were at full capacity but they could have another comparable suite available to us but we would have to pack up and be ready to go by a certain time. I reminded him that we were on our way out the door to dinner-meeting people BEFORE our showtime. He was an ass-and I ended up telling him so and we left for dinner and I tried to suck up how furious I was about the room and the smell. Luckily both dinner and the show were enough to take my mind off the room and I did get a call during dinner on my cell from the asshole manager telling me that someone was coming to repair our tub, thoroughly clean the bathroom and that the ENTIRE hotel was out of the particular lightbulb to replace above the dining room table. Hard to believe, but by this point, I was done.  There are other problems with this hotel but there are also some great things. The front desk clerks were awfully nice, the hoochie mama dresses worn by most guests made for great people watching and the overall aesthetics of the hotel are magnificent. I enjoyed the restaurants, the window shopping, etc.  I may stay here again, but probably not and definitely wouldn't waste our money on a suite here again.

We had early reservations for a party of 9 for my 40th birthday. We were seated at a lovely table and were all surprised how we could hear everyone without having to strain. This means the acoustics in the room we were in were spot on.   Our waiter was Lamont and there were various other folks helping us out. We were all served warm buttery rolls that had both a salt and we are pretty sure bit of sugar sprinkling on them. Drinks were ordered by a few of us-I imbibed just a bit as it was my birthday after all and the drinks were good, reasonably priced and tasty.   Everything we ate was wonderful. We started with 2 orders of house made potato chips with truffle oil and Parmesan. They were yummy and the perfect combination of salt and grease to help the booze go down easily. Some of us had starters, some of us chose not to.   I had the lobster bisque to start and it was heavenly with perfectly cooked lobster and nice pieces of it. Others had the Gumbo (no seafood-heat but not hot), the heirloom tomato and Burrata cheese salad. There were also a couple of other appetizers ordered-BBQ Shrimp (delicious and unlike anything we had before) and Escargot(I was too chicken to try it). Truffle Parmesan potato chips  For mains, people had  Filets Bone In Rib-eye  Salmon Scallops Medallions of beef  Since sides are generous, we all shared: Asparagus Creamed Corn-delicious (and I make my own just as good) Creamed Spinach (the most boring) Sauteed Mushrooms-fabulous Potato Gratin Twice Baked Potatoes Grits (meh-but not for me texturally)  We were all so full, we only ordered one dessert to share and that was the infamous Banana cream pie. Worth every bite and every calorie-in fact....  Kevin and I came back here for lunch our last day in Vegas! We shared the BBQ shrimp, I had the lobster bisque again and he had the heirloom tomato salad. We also shared another slice of the banana cream pie and I would do it again in a heartbeat.   Fabulous birthday dinner and wonderful company!

Most people know that the one chain restaurant  I am typical fan of is the Cheesecake Factory. Little did we know that this restaurant (and it's sister at the Palazzo, is in the same family as CF). We ended up here several time during our stay due to various reasons. Our first night here, we ended up having dinner due to the lateness of our check-in and simply being starving. We had a great waiter, and though the restaurant may be a sister to the CF, the menu is mostly different. The bread here is delicious and very crusty and basically a vehicle for butter. Great crust-and great butter. I ordred the four cheese pizza and added mushrooms and asked for the pizza to be cooked "well done".The husband ordered the chicken pot pie. When our meals arrived, the pot pie was in a GIANT bowl, covered with crust and my pizza was served Roman style (oblong not round) and was more chewy then I like. A few bites in, Kevin and I switched dishes. He loved the pizza as it was very flavorful, but texturally more to his liking. The pot pie had one of the most delicious crusts I have ever had, but the innards were kind of bland and boring. I had a crust and chicken dinner. We were too full for dessert.  The second time we came here was for dessert after the Jersey Boys where we learned that the dessert menu differs from the same restaurant in the Palazzo and our group was disappointed because we dined at the Grand Lux for dinner(at the P)and had our hearts set on certain desserts that weren't offered here. We did manage to order the strawberry shortcake (yummy) the key lime pie (good but afterwards a bit too tongue tart and the banana pudding with home made vanilla wafers. The wafers were the best part of this dessert, but the pudding itself was cloyingly sweet and our waitress wasn't too excited for our table of 6 only ordering dessert and water.  Our third and last time at this location was for lunch with 2 of my girlfriends from high school who flew in on my birthday day. They were starving and chose to come here since they were also staying at the Venetian. We came down a bit after they had been there and had already ordered.  I had the miso salmon (a staple order for me at the regular CF) and it was much better here than what I have had at any CF with more vegetables, no butter sauce and a little kick. Kevin had the lunch  size pepperoni pizza and salad and the pizza was actually small enough to fit on the same plate as the salad. I had a bit, it was too greasy for me, but that is because of the pepperoni. My friends' had a Cuban and a Carnitas sandwich both served with fries and they both loved what they ordered.   Of course the meal was served with the good vehicle for butter and yes, I had my fill.  This place is open 24 hours, with a late night menu, a breakfast menu a lunch time menu and the regular menu. If this was a place close to me, I would be a regular and not have shame since it was good.

I arrived in Phoenix a little after lunchtime last Tuesday afternoon and with a nod of approval from my mom, headed directly for FEZ. I didn't really care much what was on the menu because I mainly wanted to go to finally meet Thomas S. who has been a Yelp "friend" of mine and is now a FB friend as well.   The restaurant wasn't terribly busy because it was after 1, and the first thing I got a kick out of was the eclectic music mix that ran throughout the restaurant. I found myself singing along a little too much and luckily, my mom is used to that so it was no big deal.   She ordered the lamb kisra and a decaf coffee. I had the burger (without a bunch of stuff because I am picky like that) and a diet coke. The kisra was fabulous-different than anything either of us had ever had, and wonderful. My burger was good, but the kisra took the prize.   Service was friendly, Thomas a doll and I am really glad I had an opportunity to check this place out. Central Ave. has changed a hell of a lot since I moved back to the Bay Area 6 years ago, and with additions like this place, it has been for the better.

For any of you that have watched WPT (World Poker Tour) on TV and  have seen the bright blue tables and the banner marked The Plaza Hotel and Casino and thought, wow, this is a nice looking poker room for a Downtown Hotel, you have been duped. That was a made for TV poker room. The actual poker room is very small and positioned next to the lounge/bar area where an "old school band" (so a dealer said) played authentic music from the 40's, 50's and 60's. What they played was a lot of oldies from my parents' generation which was fine but not great.  Thursday night was dead. 1 sit and go tournament looking for another player or two and one 3/6 table going. The 3/6 table died when 1 more person decided to play the tournament which ended my poker playing at The Plaza.   No need to go back again. The gambling tables were threadbare, just like most of this hotel.  A bunch of years ago, I stayed here with my Grandma (she had 2 for 1 rooms at $40.00 a night). The rooms were scummy then and I can only imagine they are worse now after seeing the condition of the casino.

Sad to report that there is no longer a poker room at this casino... Even if the rooms are updated, there is no "draw" for me to venture to this side of Fremont Street.

We had a quick lunch here after my winning streak at the Wynn and before heading over to window shop at the mall. The man went with the special of the day-Kobe beef sliders with fries and I had a caprese panini.   Both of our dishes were served on house made rolls which were fresh and tasty. The sliders were beautifully presented and delicious and the fries were crispy and perfect for sharing. My sandwich was nicely balanced with ripe tomatoes and good pesto which was mild enough for my guy to eat (he doesn't typically like pesto). We sat outside under a large umbrella with a waterfall right in front of us giving off a lovely breeze. It made me think of being in Hawaii and I forgot for just a moment we were in 105 degree weather.  The ice cream concoctions other guests were eating looked yummy as well, but we abstained.

Read as 3.75  The layout of the shop/food is very pretty with lots to look at. The service is hit or miss and the prices are high. The plain croissant took me back to the first introduction I ever had to a croissant at a bakery whose name I can't remember that was on College Ave. that Toni took me to as a kid. Anything that brings back a visceral memory is rare and awesome.   The lattes were decent and my sweet husband went downstairs to get one for me every day of our stay. We were also treated to a box of what I think are JPP chocolates by The Aria as a gift for my birthday. My husband hogged the entire 8(or 10) pieces so I can't attest to how they taste, but the fact he didn't share spoke volumes.   Aside from the price and hit or miss service, this place is probably in the top 3 of positives of the Aria Hotel experience.

We found out about this hotel due to a timeshare spiel I got us lured into. This hotel was one of their "upgrade options", so for an extra $99 we were able to stay here for our 3 nights on the timeshare company.  I must say, this hotel was one of the best discoveries we could have ever made. This place is a non-smoking and non-gaming hotel near the convention center and the monorail. Not terribly convenient for summer time traveling(too hot to walk far,etc).and the other hotels are a $12-$15 cab ride away. These are the only downfalls to this hotel.   The customer service is by far the best I have ever received at a hotel-especially of this caliber. Friendly and helpful to the max. We ordered room service for breakfast every day, it was wonderful. The bed was super comfy with great bedding and plenty of pillows. The water pressure in the shower was better than any I have had while traveling and the bathroom had a separate shower and tub. We had a view of the Wynn's golf course and I would happily stay here again in a heartbeat-even on my own dime!

Le-CRAP!  This is really the only negative review I have for food establishments our whole 5 days in Vegas, so that is pretty good.  We had lunch here today. I ordered French Onion Soup and a Caprese salad. The man had a French Dip with French fries.   The soup was ok. Broth was a bit off tasting but we couldn't pin point why. The caprese salad was awful. So bad that we both agreed to not eat more and to send it back. It was served with both red and yellow tomatoes and only 3 slices of mozzerella. Kind of stingy for this kind of salad, but it was the tomatoes that killed the dish. They were not ripe and they were so cold they were hardly edible even if some of them would have been ripe. The sandwich was cafeteria fare at best, but what clinched this place as going on my shit list was the service.   I have a long list of jobs I have held in my time. I will not go through the list here, but know that jobs that revolve around food and customer service are on said list. This being said, our waiter did not come back until we were blatantly waiting for the bill/some acknowledgement. When I told our waiter the salad was "not good because the tomatoes were not ripe", he told me "the salad does not come with cooked tomatoes". I told him he was not understanding what I was saying, that I was saying that the tomatoes were "NOT RIPE", he then told me "well, that is how this salad comes". I told him not to argue with the customer and to take the salad off of our bill. Needless to say, this was a first for me. I totally stiffed him on any kind of tip what-so-ever and a little part of me wished I could have skipped out on the whole bill all together.  Do yourselves a favor....don't eat here!

Ever have one of those small world experiences where you think you might be safe from running into someone you know, but then wham, there you are, in a town with hundreds of thousands of people and a plethora of hotels and restaurants and bam you are sitting next to a person you worked with for a total of 2 months and left that job because that person was such a royal ahem, let us just say interesting person? Well, that is what happened to me at this fine buffet restaurant. It was awkward to say the least, but I managed through with grace and dignity that my folks would be proud of.  The food here is pretty good for a buffet. Large variety and the man was very happy as he loves seafood and sushi. The crab legs were watered down a bit, the shrimp still had shells and the crab in the sushi was krab, but those were the only negatives. The prime rib and fried shrimp were a deliciously fattening combination, that I particularly enjoyed but what made this buffet the best was the dessert bar with tons of flavors of gelato (really good gelato I might add) and some interesting cupcakes with different toppings and fillings. Good service with our soda and iced tea constantly refilled and plates taken away lickity split.  I would come back here for sure and it is definitely worth the $40 per person.

When I lived in Phoenix, I went to Rolf's at the Biltmore location a few times. It was super expensive and I was living on a budget but at the time, it was one of the very few splurges I had in my life.   On our most recent trip to Phoenix, my mother wanted to get something for my daughter's upcoming 15th birthday that she really wanted. What my daughter really wanted was highlights because she (sad at her age) hates being a redhead. We called around to a few places to see if they had any openings and then I remembered Rolf's had opened a location on the west side of town. I was able to make a very early morning appointment for her and off I took her to get her wig busted.  The young woman who did my daughter's hair (can't remember her name) was uber pretty and super sweet. She made my daughter feel comfortable right away and I left her to do her magic while I went over to my aunt and uncle's house for a visit. My mom picked my daughter up after her hair appointment and I got a call and a text from Ilana telling me how much she LOVED LOVED LOVED her hair and with the way the rest of the trip went, it was definitely the highlight(no pun intended).

This is the place that first started serving fried Oreos and Twinkies in Las Vegas. This is also the place that has scantily clad women in front handing out beads. This is a slot machine only type of casino that we walked in and out of because it smelled of the same skanky oil it smelled like when I was last here about 3.5 years ago.

We all know about Bouchon-at least us Bay Area folks do,  and this review is not for the food but for the ASS service and ASS latte i got here yesterday morning for the lovely price of $5.25.   The bread is slamming, but seriously, learn to make a fucking decent latte. When someone asks for extra foam and you give them a latte with NO Foam and said person says I asked for foam and your reaction is to pour out 1/4 of the latte to ADD foam, you best realize you are pouring out the ESPRESSO I paid for. They were not happy that I told then to remake the whole thing, but for serious, learn to make a fucking latte.    ***** Upping to 2.5 stars. Lovely husband went down this am and got a triple shot latte for me with extra foam and it was better, not great. Maybe it is because he is cuter than me!

This review is for the downstairs areas and casino only as we did not stay here.  Very pretty hotel with a comfort level of sameness that has been here for what seems like, ever. We played a few table games here and checked out the poker room which was beautiful but did not play. We did end up playing blackjack in the "Pussycat Doll Casino" which is based right outside Pure Nightclub. The music was loud, the atmosphere fun and young and we had a great time. The man ended up leaving +$200 and I was +50.  Last year, my guy stayed here with a group of guys who were in town for a bachelor party. They dined at Bradley Ogden,played poker ( a lot) and really made use of this hotel. The room was just average from what he says, but since I didn't go, I cannot comment. They are in the process of building yet another tower planned to open in 2009, so if you are looking for something newer, this might be your best bet.

I find it hard to believe that anyone would rate a Coco's a 5 star experience, but to each their own. I happened to find this location pretty much ASS when I happened in here with Mom and Grandma in tow.   Growing up in Phoenix, Coco's and Bob's Big Boy (then JB's), and Village Inn were the only coffee shop type restaurants around and Coco's was always good. Sadly, the memory of the chain and the reality of this location didn't match up.   We arrived around 1pm on a Sunday and though it wasn't my choice to eat here, I agreed. Grandma was hungry and wanted pancakes. We walked in to a pretty packed restaurant and were seated fairly quickly by a teenage host. We sat and sat and sat and sat looking at our menus and me looking around at other tables who were also sitting to either order, get their checks or their food. Turned out not only was it the "B" team, it was probably the "C" team. When our waitress finally arrived to take our order, I realized she was the only one working the entire dining room and one other waitress was working the other half of the restaurant. The hosts (2 teens I noticed) were standing around basically doing nothing and the kitchen seemed behind on getting food out to customers.   Grandma had her pancakes-I had to track down the coffee to refill her coffee (and several other customers), Mom had a BLT which was skimpy and I had a cup of their soup of the day (cream of broccoli) which was like eating a spoon full of salt and nothing could help it go down.   I was surprised that this location especially being located in Sun City had such a lack of employees working. I was also surprised at the amount of families there-but I forget that Sunday is often go to lunch after Church day.  I will skip this location in the future and hit up the JB's next door (Village Inn?) or actually get some decent coffee shop type grub at Cracker Barrel down the street. Oh, and if Grandma wants pancakes again, I might even venture just past the 101 on Bell and hit up IHOP before I hit up this place again.

Non chain real Mexican food in Sun City? Wait, what?  Is this fancy pants? No. Is this blow your mind creativity/complex flavors? No. Is this a place that puts decor/ambiance above the customer service and food? No  What this place does have is: Good quality home made food. An owner who not only cares about his customers but works with what they are in the mood for. Has daily specials. Has a fast turn around. Has a salsa bar.  Is a family run, family feel good food in a crappy location. Prices are more than reasonable. Know that your busy time will be lunch hour and then the 4:30-6:00pm Sun City dinner dining timeframe.   Say hi to Jose'. He's the real deal.

For the harder rocker in you, this was the station to listen to. This with Dave Pratt in the morning made it all fun and worth while.  Too bad my head banging days gave me a wee case of whiplash, but rock on my friends, rock on!

Yes, I know-5 stars for a fast food restaurant, but I swear, this place deserves it.  When I was a kid, it was always a treat to walk by the Chik-Fil-A in Metro Center and be lucky enough to get a sample of their delicious chicken, and would feel even luckier to have money in my pocket to buy a sandwich from here.  Well, my man had never eaten at this chain, and since we had a very long road trip home ahead of us, we decided to have an early lunch here on our way out of town.  This is not cheap fast food. It is high quality stuff-juicy chicken, fresh ingredients, nice fruit cup (including strawberries) for an alternative to fries. The cleanest bathroom I have ever seen, people coming to our table to offer up drink refills, asking if we were pleased with our meals, etc. One reason I like them is that they don't put mayo on their sandwiches!!!  This is a "Christian" business. Closed on Sundays, not sure of the politics, but interestingly enough, the only Bay Area location is in Fairfield...  A definite place to try as an alternative to all the regular fast food chains-and to know there is delicious, fresh and moderately healthy food....

Lamps Plus seems to get a really bad rap. Either they are really bad, or I have just been extremely lucky at both the Dublin CA location and the location in Peoria.   Last month I had a lot of things to take care of for my aging Grandmother. As I have written in other reviews, my Grandma is losing her eyesight and on top of that loves to "get a deal" and if there is a coupon involved, it is that much better. Grandma had been on the hunt for a new ceiling fan for her bedroom for months and (a) could not make a decision (b) kept finding ones she liked online and then the item would be out of stock or (c) the price was higher at place x vs. place y but again it was back to the fact that she just couldn't make a decision.   Not to toot my own horn (okay, just a little), I went to Lamps Plus, found a ceiling fan I knew she would love, worked with Jack (who was great, btw), took a picture, put the fan on hold, drove back to Grandma who agreed it was perfect and went back to Lamps Plus to make the purchase. I was able to arrange for an install during my trip, they took the old one off, set up her remote and almost an instant makeover to the room. Additionally with Jack's help, I purchased "Daylight" bulbs which don't take anytime to warm up so she could have as much light as possible AND much to Grandma's delight was able to use not one but two coupons towards the purchase!  All in all, success and with great customer service I hope more people write more positive reviews!

Just because it says Deli and says Brooklyn, do not mistake for Jewish or New York.  Sadly, this place felt like a glorified Subway but the fact that the bagels come off the Sysco truck clinched the truth for me. Good thing the Dunkin' Donuts across the parking lot has bagels too!

For any Phoenix native who listens to rock-this station has been around forever. They are now strictly classic rock, but when KDKB has commercials or a bunk song, this would be station #2.  Plus, it is hella fun to do the sound effect like swords making an X.

I must be having some latent AZ nostalgia going on, but I LOVE the Miracle Mile and it brings back such wonderful memories of my childhood and my Grandparents that I wanted to bring my guy here. That and I swear finding Jewish style deli in the Bay Area is almost a mis-nomer. Sorry Saul's, but you suck.  This is cafeteria style deli where you order at one end, they make your sandwich, pass it to the fry guy, and then they put on the pickle spear. They speed it down the bar toward the register where you order your drink and pay and carry your tray to a table where good spicy mustard is (along with regular yellow and ketchup). This isn't Chompie's-you won't get overwhelmed by the menu, but this is a place to get decent hot pastrami, corned beef, and hot sliced brisket. They have other sandwich offerings as well along with hot stuff and the best part...Karsha's rye bread!! Prices have gone up, but this is Phoenix folks, it is still cheaper than the Bay and definitely cheaper than lunch in Disneyland!  So, for the nostalgia part... My Grandparent's moved to Phoenix in 1949. Miracle Mile started that same year. My Great Grandparent's owned an apartment building right near where Park Central Mall is now. Anyway, Miracle Mile has been around just about this whole time too and started at 16th Street and McDowell which was then called "The Miracle Mile". This and Durant's were my families staple weekly restaurants. They had a location at Christown Mall-that was the one closest to where I was raised (back in the day folks-it was a nice mall-think Hilltop back before it was ghetto). Any special or sad occasion in my family here involved a tray from MM. Yep-any. Bris, Bar/Bat Mitzvah, Death, Birthdays, etc. It was always fresh and delicious. That and aside from Katz on Central, this was a place my Grandfather approved of.  What was funny yesterday was that when I went to the counter to order my sandwich, the man plopping on the pastrami to my rye was the same guy that plopped my pastrami on rye 20 years ago at Christown. This speaks volumes...  The food is fresh. The food is efficient. The portions are big and luckily, my situational pescatarian agreed to share a sandwich with me. My guy on the other hand, devoured his entire hot brisket sandwich on a fresh Karsha' onion roll and though he declared my brisket is better, he was very happy.

Still love this place and this time, am including a picture of my hot pastrami on rye. I think my 1st review was a perfect description and I deem it ROTD worthy, so that is all folks. Read that one and you will know...

After 12 years of business at this location I am so sad to report that Miracle Mile is now closed....  Sad I am.

Bye Bye Miss American Pie...  Man, I know I have been around a while when I can sing the lyrics to this song at the top of my lungs while a light show overhead is happening and I am not alone in this experience.   Imagine a Telegraph Avenue with the eclectic mix of hippies, druggies (think old men on ectasy), bible thumpers, and kiosks with things to buy along with Billy Joel cover bands, too many children and teenagers, cougars and hookers all on one street. This is Las Vegas in all of its glory and a fun show to watch at least once in your lifetime.   The music and graphics changed since I was last here, but definitely fun.

Pretty much all I can say is WOW. This place blew us away with only a couple of small things I wish could have been different.   When I finally narrowed down where we would be going for my Birthday dinner, I easily made a reservation via OpenTable and requested a table in the back (got this info from other Yelp reviews) and said it was going to be my Birthday.   We took a cab to Caesar's after getting a very late start to the day, did a little gambling and then walked through the Forum Shoppes to the restaurant. We were escorted to the Host Desk for the back of the restaurant and were seated in a large booth looking onto the rest of the back room. Everyone was friendly and worked together as a team seamlessly.   Our waiter was very reserved while still having a nice sense of humor. I ordered a Cosmo which was perfectly balanced and with a perfect punch. The bread basket was yummy with lavash to devour and an assortment of breads. Our favorite was a cheese and shallot ciabatta. We started with a medium order of  the Stone Crabs (less sweet than Dungeness but more meaty and tender). It came with a mayo based dipping sauce, but I asked for cocktail sauce and they also brought clarified butter). The cocktail sauce was awesome and had a nice kick on  its own, but what was so cool is that there was a dollop of horseradish on the side like a garnish, but to allow each guest to make their cocktail sauce a spicy as they want it. It was something I had never seen before and quite memorable.  We shared a chopped salad which was kindly split in the kitchen. It was underdressed and one of the items we wished we hadn't ordered. For our mains, the Husband opted for the Beef Wellington (as rare as possible) and I ordered the bone in ribeye- medium rare. For sides to share, we opted for the GreenBeans ammadine (not almandine) and the special of AuGratin Potatoes. My steak was beautiful. It was perfectly cooked, seasoned and truthfully probably the best rib eye I have eaten in a restaurant of any caliber (and I have had many). The Wellington was too rare for me to taste, but the husband loved it and we really liked the green beans. The only "miss" here were the potatoes as they were pretty unremarkable and missing cheese and proper seasoning.  I had been looking forward to the key lime pie I had been reading about as my birthday dessert, so when the waiter brought out a very rich chocolate brownie sundae with a candle, I was a bit disappointed. I am a peasant when it comes to chocolate (I consider milk See's the fancy kind I like), this brownie was so rich even my husband could only muster a few bites. When our waiter came by, I inquired about a slice of the key lime pie, and he asked if I wanted a half slice (who knew they could do that?). I was glad I spoke up and my half slice arrived promptly and was the perfect way for me to end a rich and satisfying meal.   Winner Winner Birthday Dinner and seriously look forward to coming back here someday.      .

Saving the best review for last and what a way to wrap up our Vegas adventure.  We have been eating at a lot of high end steakhouses this year. I knew we wanted to go to a fancy place to celebrate my guy's birthday and since we were staying at The Renaissance and after reading the stellar reviews of this restaurant on Yelp, I knew this would be the restaurant for us. All of the room service at this hotel comes from this restaurant as well, so I had a feeling the meal would be good-I just had no idea as to how good.  The menu is creative. Everything like most high end steak houses is a la carte. Kevin started with the roasted tomato soup with fried Jarlsberg(his favorite) cheese. It was light and tasty. I had the spinach salad with pancetta, fried goat cheese and a bacon balsamic reduction. Both of these were a fabulous start to our meal and what we both appreciated was the size of these were perfect. Not too big, not too small.   Kev ordered the surf and turf (you get to choose which surf and turf) and he went with seared scallops and a petite fillet. I had the bone-in rib-eye steak and we opted for the lobster macaroni as our side (there were several we wanted but knew it would be too much food). Our waiter recommended the creamed corn, but we still went with the macaroni. Upon the arrival of our food, I was awe stricken at the presentation. Simple and elegant. My steak was perfectly charred on the outside and pink on the inside. Tender and flavorful, I closed my eyes and was taken back to a wonderful childhood memory of an old-time steakhouse in Phoenix called Durant's. I cannot remember the last time I had a steak this wonderful. Kev really loved his meal and said it was better than that of his last summer at Bradley Ogden and might even be better than Fleming's. The lobster macaroni was perfectly balanced in flavor with just enough lobster to cheese to pasta ratio. When I told our server how happy we were with the macaroni, he went to the kitchen and brought us out a small sample of the creamed corn. I hate to admit this, but dang, that was probably the most delicious sample of anything I have ever tasted. It was made with fresh roasted corn, bacon and a hint of cheese.   To end our meal, our waiter brought Kevin a banana bread pudding (which was incredible) with caramel gelato and cashew brittle. He even had Happy Birthday written in caramel on the plate.  Our server was fantastic. He treated us like royalty and even comped a second glass of wine and our dessert. After our disastrous meal at earlier in the week at Ruth Chris in Walnut Creek, I was overwhelmed with joy.  Highly recommended. Take the time, take the taxi and make reservations on OpenTable.com and get to this fabulous restaurant!

After our week in Page, we spent a few nights in Sun City with my Mom and Grandma. Since we were there in summer (which is a rarity for me) I was able to talk Grandma into going somewhere besides the Elephant Bar and a place without having a coupon! As luck would have it, she suggested Skye saying it was a wonderful place and she knew we would enjoy it as an early birthday celebration for my husband.   Man oh man was this a great restaurant. Actually it seems like it is half restaurant, half night club and with our 5:30 reservation (yes, this was a "late" dinner for my Grandma), we of course only spent time in the actual restaurant.   We were a party of 6 and 4 of us had a cocktail to start. My cosmo was one of the "specials" and was nice and strong for only $6.00. It was the most creative cosmo I have had as it came with a little dry ice in it. Grandma was very happy with her martini and well, no one said much as we drank and perused the menu whilst nibbling on a really good and creative bread basket.   My husband and I shared mostly everything and others on the table traded bites. We started with both the Caesar salad and lobster bisque. I was highly impressed with both. The Caesar had homemade croutons and dressing and were very tasty and the lobster bisque was heavenly-not too rich and full of real lobster (even in Arizona!). My daughter had a specialty salad with Gorgonzola and strawberries and loved every morsel. Since I don't eat stinky cheese, I cannot attest to the taste but she keeps talking about the salad.   For our entree, Kevin and I shared a bone-in ribeye. This was what 3 of the six(4 if you count me) ordered. My mom had the fish special which was melt in your mouth to die for and my daughter had the filet. The sides are huge and are meant for sharing (like Fleming's or Ruth Chris), so 5 of us shared baked potatoes and mushrooms while the last of our party had the twice baked that no one else got to taste (must have been good).  Our steak was incredible and rivals with my memories of Durant's. I savored every cholesterol increasing bite. My Grandma enjoyed hers so much she looked over to me and thanked me for insisting we go somewhere different.  Unbeknownst to me, 2 desserts were brought out with candles to celebrate the upcoming birthday of my husband and other part of our party. The desserts were delicious and beautifully presented and since they were "on the house", my Grandma was pleased.   I am coming back to the Phoenix area at the end of the month for a couple of nights and am already angling for a reason to come back to Skye...I loved it, I really loved it!

We did late dinner last night after playing poker at Bally's. Since we were staying at Paris anyway, we figured we would stay close for dinner and then go back to our room for a bath.   Service was just okay. Not spectacular so that part I would give 3 stars to. What gets the 4 stars here was the food. Mainly what I ordered...  They have lamb burgers. I LOVE domestic lamb. In fact, growing up, we ate more lamb than beef, so when I see it on a menu, I tend to go that direction. The man had a turkey burger with Swiss which he enjoyed, but we both agreed my burger rocked our mouths. I ordered it Mediterranean style with a freshly baked onion roll. What this consisted of was a perfectly medium cooked lamb patty, feta cheese, kalamata olives and about 1/8 of an avocado. OMG, so delicious, I wanted to eat another one of these today (with the Le Crap place, I should have)! The fries were decent-they offered them in 3 varieties of string, steak or waffled, but we really only ate a couple of them as our burgers were so filling.   What a great place! Highly recommended!

Very pretty hotel and we had fun walking through all of the shops and eating at the Grand Lux and seeing Jersey Boys here. Due to the issues with our room at the Ventian, we may stay in a room at this hotel next time since I was sent a free upgrade coupon...

When I lived in Phoenix, I used to frequent CB quite often as the food was reasonably priced, breakfast or lunch was always good and service was stellar. I also liked the store in front of the restaurant and would often find things to buy from seasonal items to collectibles (long ago it was Boyd's Bears) and they had good candy.  Well, I have lived in the Bay Area for well over 8 years again and this was the first time I have been back to a Cracker Barrel. This time was for breakfast with my Mom and daughter. The service, as I remembered was fantastic, the menu huge but with things from reasonably sized to giant portions and all that in between. This was the first restaurant I can remember that asked me if I wanted my poached eggs soft, medium or hard (soft please) and the cheesy hashbrown casserole was still as good as I remembered.   I will be back when I come back to town next and I can't wait!

It's a small world indeed.   This is a family run business and this review is for the catering service and the incredible food and for the amazing owners, Snir and Kierstin Mor. Why do I say it's a small world? Well, Kierstin happens to be from San Ramon. Yep, of all the Bay Area, a San Ramon person catering the first night of Shiva in honor of my Grandmother in Sun City, Arizona and the restaurant is in Surprise. Small world indeed.  Jewish rituals around death are to some very hard to deal with and can be very complicated. Due to the fact my Gram had been living near me for the past year but still had her residence in Sun City and due to proximity of the mortuary and cemetery and other factors, my Mom and I decided to use a caterer to ensure we had enough food for everyone who may come for Shiva( traditionally everyone who attends the graveside would attend) My mom still being a local had been to their restaurant and had contacted them when we knew my Grandmother's death was imminent. We were and still are very grateful that Snir understood without question that we couldn't give him a set date or time just a heads up and a basic idea of timing and what our needs were and where the Shiva would be taking place.  How can one review the food for what gentiles would consider a wake? Well, my feeling is how could I not. I'm Jewish- I like to eat. I like to talk about food. I like to cook food (someday will get my groove back with this)- The food was seriously THAT GOOD. Snir and Kierstin were THAT GREAT and luckily we ordered more than needed as we ended up needing to serve the leftovers the following evening and it fed me for another couple of days.   I can honestly say Snir made the absolute BEST quiche I have ever eaten and I have eaten a lot of quiche in my life. First of all, I am still amazed at how he was able to cater quiche that was so light, so layered and so perfectly executed.  I have dreams about this quiche (and due to the eating my feelings since my Gram's passing the dream part is no exaggeration). We also had 2 different phenomenal vegetarian lasagnas one with eggplant one with olives, a couple of different salads- one with kale and quinoa and one with candied nuts The dressing was amazing. The rolls were great and lastly the lemon bars (no left overs) and the pot de creme(too rich for my taste buds but everyone raved about them) were a nice way to end a hard day on a sweet note.     I will say that if I lived in the area and needed catering, this would be my go to caterer. I wished I could have had the opportunity to to their actual restaurant but I know that day may come. Knowing that the restaurant is in Surprise, I am certain that all of the chain restaurants around may overshadow the gem but I sure hope not.   Toda Raba!

Oh what a night!!!  I knew I wanted to see a show while I was in Vegas and knew I didn't want to go far from our hotel nor see Phantom. When I found out Jersey Boys was playing at the Palazzo, and I could get discount tickets with my Grazie card, I immediatly called my Mom (who was joining us) and a couple of friends who were going to be with us Friday night as well to see if they wanted to see the show. All of us were a "yes" and even my mom's friend who had seen the show before could't wait to see it again.  The show started right on time at 7 and ran like a well oiled machine. It was engaging, the music fantastic, the singing/acting superb and finally learned more about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. I even learned there were songs that were there's that I had no idea who to give the credit to.   The theatre was packed and I am sure most of the shows are sold out and can't believe the energy coming from the stage to the audience. I would see this show again in a heartbeat and am happy to say that this is how I ended the last night of my 30's!

Had dinner here my first night in town with my mom, step father and my grandmother. Upon walking in,I knew we were venturing into an upscale type of steak house-not quite the dark boothed feel of old school and not quite a Ruth Chris atmosphere.   We were seated in a booth, our waitress was very nice and very young. She advised us of two specials-one a veal chop and one a fish of sorts. My grandmother has been known to love veal chops and we all strongly encouraged her to order one. The rest of the menu was inviting and this is also the type of restaurant where all the sides are a la carte. I ordered the rib eye medium rare and grandma and I decided to share a caesar salad and a baked potato. Mom ordered a salad, step dad ordered prime rib and a potato as well.   Our salad arrived as well as bread. The first thing I was shocked with is that instead of spitting the salad for us in the kitchen, the brought the salad and an another plate. First of all, in this type of establishment, for these types of prices, and considering the economy,  I was a bit put off but was able to let it go. Our meals arrived on very hot plates. The veal chop was gorgeous-and grandma dove right in. My rib eye was also gorgeous and huge (should have been for $27+), but it was finished off with butter (something I don't like especially without a gallbladder) and had a spicy rub on it. I took two small bites and was overwhelmed by the spicy flavor (something again I hate with a supposed good cut of meat um, hello Outback).   The prime rib was good (or so I was told) and when the waitress came back(this took a long time as well), I told her that the menu did not state the meat was seasoned nor finished off with butter. She acknowledged I was correct and asked if I would like another steak. At this point, I was done (I get like this when I get mad at food) and said no. She was apologetic and grandma kept on loving the veal chop. I was eating the potato grandma and I were splitting and the owner/chef came to our table and apologized for the steak. I said it was fine, he said he would take it off the bill (DUH) and then I said to him it was probably a good idea to train the waitstaff to advise how the steaks are prepared with spice rub and finished off with butter. He then told me they ARE trained to do this and that our waitress did advise him that she forgot to mention this to us/me. Oh well.  I like the fact this place is not a chain restaurant. I like that my grandmother enjoyed her meal so much. I didn't like the lack of service for the price nor my meal, so I will have to say this place will not be on my "must visit" list the next time or any time I am in town.

When this place first opened, I was working for a company nearby and would frequent this establishment often because it reminded me of Northern CA. It had good bread, interesting combinations and at the time, a non-chain quality ingredient type restaurant. I introduced many to this place including my Mother and co-workers galore.   When I was in AZ in January, I had a breakfast date planned with a girlfriend from high school. It is amazing at what connections Facebook has brought back into my life and this is one of the great ones. I suggested to meet here because it was easy enough to hop on the 101 from Sun City and easy enough for her to hop on I-17 from where she lives.   I arrived a little early and waited in the car right in front of the restaurant. I  was thrilled to see how busy it was and all the people drinking coffee and eating outside with their dogs. As I was getting out of the car, I noticed a particular stunning dog and talked to him first then looked at the owner of the pooch. Wouldn't you know it, but it was on of my old bosses (a big boss at that) whom I hadn't seen in maybe 12 years. Small world indeed!  Lara walked up and we went inside. I had to keep myself from drooling at all of the baked offerings and almost ordered my old favorite lunch instead of breakfast. After going back and forth a little (this is an order at the counter type of place) I opted for the lemon ricotta pancakes and a couple of over easy eggs on the side. Lara ordered the banana nut pancakes with scrambled eggs and we both had iced tea. The bill was something less than $20 and we easily found a booth, hankered down and sipped on delicious tea while we waited for our food.  The food was great-eggs perfectly done, pancakes delicious albeit a little more dense than I am used to with ricotta cakes, but really good. We took up the booth for what seemed like hours (it was really only about 1 1/2) and chatted away. Was the breakfast 5 stars, no, probably more like a solid 3.75 but for all they offer, for the memories, the company and the iced tea alone, it is a 5 all the way.

We came to this location twice. The first one was for dinner before seeing "Jersey Boys" and the second was for a late dinner after a day/night of gambling on Fremont Street(where food is kind of ass).   Same bread as the other Lux, and the same menu except for desserts (they make home made beniegts and pineapple upside down cake). I also had Asian nachos both times which I swear are ingenious and DELICIOUS. Yes, Asian nachos-wonton skins (instead of chips), a light amount of cheese, scallions and a delicious spicy/sweet peanut sauce with a little wasabi "cream" which wasn't very noticeable but made a for just enough heat to send these over the top. Our first night, a bunch of us shared different things from calamari to said nachos to salad and burgers.   Our second time here, we were seated next to folks from San Angelo and Fort Worth Texas and started sharing butter/bites of desserts with the other tables and seemed to talk and talk for a long time about having teens, etc.  Desserts are worth it here for sure and though we had the same waitress both times (she was a bit weird), we would come back here again for sure.

I am backlogged on review writing so many will be out of order. I have been to Phoenix 3x's this year already and will be going another 2 times before years end.   This past April, when I was in town I met my mom and an old co-worker of hers that I hadn't seen since my baby shower almost 17 years ago now. I had never been to a CB before and since Wildflower hadn't opened yet and Paradise (aka-more options Panera) had already been tried, I was excited to see what this place was about.  Like Panera, it is an order at the counter and they bring you your food. They have tons of options for breakfast, lunches and dinners from sandwiches, baked goods and salads. Since I arrived late my mom and her friend Bev were already mid-way through their lunches (this wasn't a planned meeting). I ordered the smaller portion of the Asian Edamame salad adding avocado and water. The young man taking my order was seriously one of the sweetest "kids" I have encountered in a very long time. He explained menu options, we talked about how hard it was working so close to Sun City dealing with all the personality types and so on. They do not have tip jars but he was so sweet that I inquired if they were allowed to take tips. He looked at me as if I was speaking a foreign language. I tipped him and he came from around the corner and gave me a hug.   I joined my mom and Bev at the table and the "kid" brought me a piece of cake (not ordered) along with my salad. So sweet. My salad was pretty tasty-the dressing was a bit spicy but tolerable and I liked the food options much better than expected.   When we were all done, I gave Bev a hug, and told my mom I was going to get more water to go. The "kid" was on his break having lunch with his GF who then introduced me to her and gave me yet another hug to say thank you. I have never been thanked so much for a $5.00 tip-and it just went to show me how much a little niceness and appreciation can mean to another person.   Since this time a I noticed a CB opened locally (review to come) and definitely would go to this location again when in town (after I fulfill my Wildflower Bread Company craving).

Compared to the similarly set up Caramba's, this place almost rocked my world. The price, the vibe, the food-all of the above.  I met a girlfriend from high school here for dinner at her suggestion and since I love Mexican food and had such a lame experience at Caramba's I jumped at the chance. I ordered my typical test drive meal at a new place. 2 crunchy tacos one shredded beef, one shredded chicken with refried beans, rice and a small side of guacamole. Our food was ready quickly, and my tacos were wonderful. Both of them were great as was the just fried little grease dripping taco shell. The beans were tasty and the rice was great and luckily had no carrots or peas. The guacamole was average.   This is not fine dining. This is not fancy. This is really good freshly made food and I will be back hopefully next month when I am back in town.

Gorgeous hotel with lots of places to sit, schmooze, booze and peruse. We did a small bit of gambling, ate at the Wicked Spoon, enjoyed the ambiance and loved the retro feel.  The shopping was disappointing-nothing that excited either of us but there are some other restaurants we will try and possibly spend a night or few here for something special.

The 1 star reviews for this company are accurate. Be warned. Be wary. If your Home Warranty Company recommends this place, ask for another company. This company is based out of Las Vegas. This company uses people who are here on work visas from Latvia/Russia/etc. They can be very hard to understand but luckily, I am of Eastern European decent so I can deal with the accents. Be ready to be assertive and be ready to be disappointed. Again, avoid at all costs if you can-unless you can wait and wait for a repair job.  We are currently contracted with a Home Warranty Company for anything that can (and seems to) go wrong in our house and when things break down, they seem to happen in 3's.   The first thing that happened in our house was our garbage disposal and the company that came out to fix the garbage disposal was prompt, efficient and replaced the whole disposal for the mere cost of the service fee ($55). The second thing that happened was our air conditioner went out and the same thing happened. The contracted company came, charged us $55 and fixed our A/C with one shot. The third thing to go wrong in our house was that my oven decided to die and give an error code. I contacted the Home Warranty company and this is the repair company they have a contract with.   To make a very long story short, I was without a working oven for 2 months. Yep, 2 months. The first call seemed to be okay and I was told a tech would be out between 1 and 4pm. The tech showed up at 6:30pm and we were out to dinner ( I had left many phone calls regarding the lateness with no updates). The next day, our appointment was rescheduled for 2 days later and the tech showed up this time but to do nothing but see the actual error code (me relaying the code wasn't good enough), and then they had to order the part to replace. The part took over a week to arrive and to get an appointment scheduled to replace it. The replacement happened, but since I wasn't home (just the husband was), the guys replaced the part and left. They didn't turn on the oven to see if it would work or anything. Sure enough a few days later when I went to use the oven, the minute it reached 350 an error code popped up. I was just relieved I wasn't having company over and that it wasn't on a day like Thanksgiving.  I called Avalon and asked the receptionist to speak to a manager. I spoke with someone advised of the situation as I had started documenting everything and called our Home Warranty Company to lodge a complaint. I was advised I would hear back from someone within 24 hours. I heard back from Avalon who advised they ordered the other part for the oven and that it would take a week for the part to come in and once it was in, they would call to set up a time to install it. After a week, I called Avalon (they didn't call me) and was told they had the part and we scheduled an appointment time. I again was given a window and told them explicitly, the window was pushing the far end of when I had to pick up my daughter from school. I was promised they would show at the earlier side of the window and guess what? I was lied to again. They showed up at the far end, made it hard to make sure the work was done properly (luckily my daughter is almost 15 and has a cell phone) and made them wait to see if the oven heated properly to all degrees on all settings. Sure enough, it finally worked and has been working ever since (fingers crossed it stays this way since I am writing this review).  AVOID AVOID AVOID...

Just as an FYI, this company is now going by the name ABM Appliance Repair, INC. Still the same crappy service just a "new name" to make their profile look better for the Home Warranty Company.

My Grandma turned 89 in November and in December, was "gently" side swiped by an 18 year old driving in Sun City. Long story short, her car finally ended up at LPCC.  Todd and Ally(sp?) were compassionate, helpful, patient and kind in working with my Grandma, the insurance company of the other driver, my Grandma's caretaker, Hertz, and the list goes on and on. Most of all, they did great work and were able to get Grandma's 2003 Toyota Corolla with a whopping 18K miles on it looking like new.  I would have my car sent here any time I had an issue-my fault or not and they were simply an awesome company and people to have worked with to get things situated for my Gram.

Custard style ice cream? I am now completely spoiled and no trip to DQ will cut it. The husband keeps telling me we need to have some of their ice cream shipped up here-I keep explaining that it won't happen.   The food is take it or leave it IMO, but even I was a fan of the bits of ice cream I had on my two visits here and definitely a super fan of their banana milkshake which could indeed bring all the boys to the yard. Damn right.

I was excited when my row mate on the plane told me that Popo's had opened a second location taking over an old Garcia's. I was totally bummed that this Popo's was kind of poopy compared to the original one in Maryvale.   I ordered a cheese crisp and it was so sad I almost cried. The chicken taco was decent and the rice and beans were the requisite decent as were the chips and salsa. What totally sucked was the fact that their "guacamole" is something green (not real avocado mixed with sour cream). False advertising and I can just imagine what any lactose intolerant person would have to deal with if consuming this (thankfully, not one of my issues). I managed to order a couple of sides of avocado slices, some lemons and used their decent salsa to make my own guacamole. I grew up on Arizona Mexican food. This was not right on so many levels-except for our server who was adorable and accommodating.

After a little winning in the poker room, the husband and I did some shopping at the Forum Shops and ended up deciding on lunching here and are both thrilled we did. Both the service and the food way exceeded our expectations and we wished we had a little more time to have eaten here again before we left.  We shared tomato soup that came with a small sliver of a delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We also had the warm goat cheese salad with a wonderful green goddess dressing and finally, we shared a french dip sandwich with a side of yukon gold mashed potatoes instead of french fries.   Our waitress was great, refilling our drinks and even splitting our sandwich so Kevin could have cheese on his half and I could have mine without it. It was a great French dip and a great meal overall!

Every time I come to Vegas, regardless where I am staying, I have to trek over to Caesar's just to go to the Forum Shops. I have loved this place since I was a teenager and though there are tons of high end places, there are more than enough regular old places to shop as well.   Restaurants have come and gone (I miss the Stage Deli) but have found PJ Harvey's now, and luckily can spend hours here without spending a lot of money (unless I want to).  I will definitely be back!

In late August, I used the power of Yelp to find DCR Titles as I had a plan to move my Grandmother's car from Arizona to California. Gram's car had been sitting in her carport for basically a year and I was going to be back in Phoenix for a wedding in September and planned on driving the car home afterwards.  Originally, I thought I was going to have to deal with MVD to do a title transfer, but after a quick phone call to these great folks, they explained to me the best options and with what I was doing, why the title transfer made no sense in AZ.   I arrived here with all the paperwork in hand, my handy Yelp check-in bonus and with a big laugh as the dude in front of me tried to convince this reputable business that even thought his "wife" wasn't there to sign the paperwork, they could call or even Skype with her for her approval...  It was a hot as hell day and one of the guys here (sorry about the lack on name recall), came out and took of the handicap plates (put them in the back seat) and affixed the temporary "good to drive legally" paperwork to the back window. When I say it was a hot as hell day I mean it was a Labor Day weekend hot as fuck and reminded me of one of the many reasons of why I don't live in AZ anymore.   I ended up driving the car up here mid September and put 800 miles on the 2004 Corolla that still has under 21K miles on it.   This is a great service but don't kid yourselves that they will do anything shady.

Aye Caramba.   My mom knows my love of Mexican food-and especially good Mexican food. Sadly, I am the only one in my immediate Phoenix family that is a fan. Growing up, the Grandparent's would begrudgingly go to one place called La Pinata (see my review from 2011) because that was close to both our synagogue (yes, this was back in the day) and my Great Aunt and Uncle's house. They would only have cheese crisps (only those from AZ, my Toni (through my Dad) and Ivy understand and share the love of a good one) or a chimichanga. My mom likes chips and refried beans and cheese crisps. She also likes guacamole but for some reason, can't pronounce it right.   Anyway, during my recent week in Phoenix, it was not a vacation or resting type of trip. It was a little visiting and a lot of business type trip. Mom and I ended up here for dinner because she said that people she knows really like this place, so we went as it was close to an errand we were running.   This is an order at the counter, they call your number type of place. There is a bar to one side the ordering area and the pick up area. They have Pepsi products, a salsa bar but you have to pay for chips. Mom wanted a cheese crisp and I ordered my standard new place order 2 crispy tacos one chicken, one shredded beef with refried beans and rice. I also ordered a small container of correctly pronounced guacamole. The cashier was friendly though not particularly warm.    We found a table, and our number was called shortly thereafter.  The tacos were in home made formed and fried corn tortilla shells. I loved this. Sadly, that was about all I loved. The chicken taco was pretty dried out and they had large shredded Americanized tasting cheddar over the tacos. The beef taco was better, but the spicy carrots helped and the guacamole was nothing to write home about. What really got me though was the weird tinny flavor from the refried beans (pretty inedible) and as one Bay Area friend of mine would say-the rice was all wrong. Not only did it have peas AND carrots, it had some small corn kernels. Mom ate about half her cheese crisp and the fact that I didn't even try it speaks volumes. She apologized as we were leaving saying she thought it would be better, and she apologized even more adamantly when she told me she had been up a lot during the night because of the cheese crisp. Yep-I knew something wasn't right with the cheese.  Not a place I would recommend or ever come back to especially after an old friend from high school introduced me to Carolina's.

I would eat the French Dip and buttery mashed potatoes from here every day if (a) it was close to home and (b) there were no calories involved.  I had a planned trip to Phoenix September 26th and had lunch here upon my arrival after my mom picked me up from the airport. I had planned on us going to Houston's (which used to be in this location but is now a Hillstone across the street and to the East).   We came in around 1pm to a very loud restaurant . It is a gorgeous place with many inviting items on the menu and I am still dreaming of the French Dip I had since almost everything that has transpired over the past couple of months and the 3 extra trips to Phoenix I have made since has overshadowed much of my memory except for the following PSA:  Remember that when you are in AZ, servers do not make minimum wage so make sure if you have great service to more than double the tax and tip in cash if possible (sorry IRS or CPA's reading this).

My husband has a serious infatuation with custard ice cream. He is also is a fan of Culver's and luckily, we found one not too far away from where my Mom is currently living on the East Side of town.  We came here after seeing a movie and he ordered a small strawberry sundae. We had no idea they were running a special $2.00 for this and he ordered, we left and whilst he was devouring his treat in the backseat, we heard not a peep out of him. He declared it was his favorite and he should have gotten 10 scoops!  I was happy he was happy and like the other Culver's, the food isn't of interest to me (he likes the fried cheese curds too), I was glad he got his ice cream fix.

Airport prices. Check. Airport quality-HELL NO. Great guacamole, in house made chips served warm with a nicely balanced salsa. Easily one of the best ribeye steak taco platter I have ever had and the hot off the homemade press corn tortillas and interesting quinoa/kale salad made for a fabulous texture, flavor mix.   If I would have had more time, I would have indulged in an adult beverage and possibly had more room for the one bite of dessert I could shovel in before having to run through security.   Yes, good enough to visit the real deal somewhere in town but great enough to make a little extra airport time to indulge.

Pretty quality Mexican food and service. Restaurant is a bit dark (no matter what time of day) so just a warning. Prices are high - and there is an additional fee tacked on (couldn't tell if is was a partial resort fee but definitely and extra tax) and soda is served in small bottles so like every other Vegas restaurant wanting more than one pop costs you.   I had the 2 shredded beef crispy taco lunch with refried beans (lard is used in them) and rice, with a side of guac (not listed on menu so no idea of price until bill comes) and the husband had chile verde (came with side of rice/beans and his choice of corn or flour tortillas-he chose the latter). My tacos were yummy, the guac was good (not spicy and a good contrast to the spicy salsa that is served with the chips) and the husband enjoyed his meal.   My taco lunch was $18 and his chile verde was around $24. Each Diet Coke (3 in total I think) were $4 each and then add the guac and service fee and lunch was $75 before tip.  Aside from the price, this was the best part of The Aria Hotel.

All hail to another Wildflower location closer to my Mom and Grandma's house!   I have long been a fan of the WBC-and though they took away the bread salad they used to have, this is still one fantastic place. The menu seems more complex than I remembered, but lucky for me, they still have my favorite sandwich on the menu. Service was friendly and efficient. This location is still new, so I suspect they will get the flow of service and food execution down pat.   Lots more outdoor seating here then the Deer Valley location and I look forward to many more visits.

Rushed meal at the airport waiting for our plane and we totally lucked out with getting seats at this tasty place.  Airport food is hit or miss. Mostly a miss- especially when you are close to the gates. Since this was a quick trip and there were arrival issues(ours) and TSA issues(theirs) on both legs of the flight to and from Oakland, our expectations were marginal at best.  My husband ordered the Margarita Pizza and I ordered a BLTA sans mayo with a salad instead of fries. Within minutes both meals arrived and I was impressed with the amount of delicious non-kosher bacon on my no mayo bread and the ripeness of the tomato and perfect avocado. I was pleased. The husband wolfed down his hot pizza (we were in a hurry) and didn't speak much. It wasn't until later he admitted his pizza was one of the best he had ever had, like ever.  I am pretty sure they have non-airport locations and next time we come to town, will seek them out. For now, just know- you never ever have to settle for Pizza Hut or Sbarro's again in Terminal 4.

The best thing this place has to offer is the Monday Special (full sized pizza and 2 soft drinks for $20), where you get 2 good for anything/time Harkins (and any location) movie passes. Otherwise, I would never come back here for the food.  We came here with my mom for a bite to eat and she wanted to try someplace new. It was a Monday and it was around 4pm with a few people scattered throughout the restaurant. The second star is for whom I would assume was the manager who seated us, got us set up with menus and was very nice. The Monday deal is also worth its own star.  IF this business reads reviews, please note that sometimes it is ok for your waitstaff to write things down so that food is delivered as ordered.  Beer Cheese soup that husband ordered as a starter arrived with his pizza and was broken and not smooth. The fish and chips my mom ordered was overcooked and dry and my happy hour sized pizza was undercooked and not edible. Food was subpar for the most part but the husband liked his pizza enough.   I would also make sure that your long haired waitresses, tie their hair back a bit so that hair does not end up on the outside of a glass or in food and that your hostesses don't just stand around playing with or stroking their hair extensions. Service pretty much sucked, but we knew we wouldn't be coming back.  So, if you do decide to come- it might be to your taste as everything is subjective. Just as a note, an adult ticket at Harkin's for a nighttime movie is $10 (way less than theaters in the Bay Area) and the Monday special where you get two movie tickets for a $20 pizza that is large enough to share and 2 sodas is a steal of a deal.

A free standing Miracle Mile- hell yes! Since the downfall of the locations I grew up with at Park Central, and ChrisTown Malls, the closing of the locations at both Arrowhead and what used to be The Colonade Mall (turned into some kind of strip mall place), I was thinking I would never again get to have a hot pastrami sandwich from a place that has been in my life since I moved to Phoenix at the age of 4 and that had been in my maternal families life since before then.  We came on a Sunday around noon after we were at the cemetery for the unveiling of my Grandmother's headstone. It was had/has been an emotional time and going to a place that had an historical place in my memory and in our family seemed somewhat appropriate. The ONLY thing that was missing was the Karsha's rye bread (Karsha's closed) and the rye bread they are using isn't quite as tasty, with the right kind of pull. The pastrami was just like all of my memories.   MM used to be a Jewish Deli and has been Jewish "Style" for years and years now. My husband loved his turkeyBLTA and his side knish and everyone else enjoyed what they had.   Private parking lot- and perfectly planned thick covered door handle coverings so you don't burn your hands opening the door.  Looking forward to coming back.
