I've been going to Carolinas since I was in nursing school, nearly 10 years ago. The prices have increased over the years, but the quality of food has never changed. It's the best Mexican food restaurant in the entire southwest! Keep it up! Everything is made from scratch. Just like grandmas cooking!

The furnishings were clean & updated. Had greasy smell when walked in door, but I expect that from fast food establishment. Everything we ordered was exceptionally fresh. The bread was fresh, staff sliced the roast beef fresh. The cooking area appears clean and the staff was friendly. I'm glad we stopped in. $15 for two to eat (drank water) and one yummy Salty Caramel shake.  Almost didnt stop in because of last review. And, they play American country music if anyone is interested (im not fond of it, but it is different for Phoenix, AZ).

Was a great place to eat, now food is greasy, and it doesn't taste like it used to. Used to have a more of a homemade taste, now tastes like Costco business center. Sad. I loved going here.

Food is always great! I love their pecan cole slaw & the corned beef brisket. The cornbread tastes like I make at home (Krusteaz from costco).  Kinda pain to find if your heading there for the first time. Head up the 17 til Dunlap & then head back down the road next to the freeway to get to it. It's worth it. Prepare to bring home leftovers. We do every time. About $40 for two to eat (drinking water). Desserts are huge, can order half desserts. Free dessert on your birthday, still embarrassing to be sung to....

Doesn't even deserve 1 star. Music was too loud for the middle of the day. Our food was delivered to another table, then removed from their table & brought to us. Then they did not get the soup order correct - stating "I'll check on that". After over 5 mins passed I called to ask (there are no servers) if the correct soup would be sent & still took a while to get a disgusting over microwaved beef & vegetable. The pieces of meat were like hard rocks & frankly the soup tasted like it was tainted. The tomato & basil soup had a good flavor, however was cold upon serving. Definitely will not return. I figure this must be more of a drinking hole.

Jerk chicken is  great! Sampler appetizer platter is definitely worth it. Portions are large, so come hungry!

First clue was when we heard the sound of the microwave in the kitchen. The homemade drinks were okay. The tamales were microwaved from frozen, so scorching hot difficult to tell the taste. The pupusas were fresh made and looked nice, but they had no true flavor. Had to add salt and their salsa to make edible. Not too bad for price - $2 each. If I were to go back and were stuck hungry in the area I would eat pupusas with salt & salsa, but I would hope that wouldnt happen....  Still $20 for two to eat wasted. The staff was friendly.

Wow huge place! Lots of TVs, lots of seating & a high ceiling! Super fresh food even at 1pm on a Tuesday. Pizza made when ordered, boneless wings tasty & juicy.   $30 for large pizza, 24 boneless wings & 2 unlimited refill drinks. Way more than enough for 2 people, we'll be eating this for days... Also, has drink & slice for $3, drink & 2 slices for $6 - great deals for lunch time.   Staff friendly. Fast service. I'll be back. :)

Fresh baked bread, fresh cut ingredients. What more can you ask for in a sub shop. Very highly recommended Mom & Pop shop.

Wait time is stupid. Chairs uncomfortable. No air movement- humid & stale. A lot of employees are walking around behind the counter chatting. Took 2 hours to finally be called, 5 mins to get helped.  So, don't go there in a hurry.  Also there are people set up outside on the front sidewalk area soliciting for insurance purchase and signing petitions. Makes me feel like its unprofessional.
