This place deserves more than 5 stars. This is how homemade Mexican food is suppose to taste like. My mom told me about this place and ever since then we go there every time there's a special occasion. We would go every weekend if this place was a lil closer than home. I always order their shredded beef enchilada plate that includes bean and rice. Absolutely amazing. The sauce was the perfect hint of spicy to it. The meat was fresh as well. Bean and rice is my favorite. Also! This place has a great price for how much food you get. It's delicious and I will recommend anyone there for Mexican food. Love it!

This place was great! The service was awesome too; workers are really nice. It's a cool stoner environment. I ordered the Dank sandwich which is basically a pizza sub and it was delicious. Their brownies are really good too! Price isn't too bad, it's definitely cheaper than Firehouse but a lil pricer than Subway. All in all, I'll come here more often especially since it's right across the street from Mesa Community College. They also have Kool-Aid which is awesome!!!!

I love this place! We come here all the time for dinner. This place usually is not that busy so the service here is pretty fast. Can be in and out within 30 minutes. The food is fresh and always delicious. I always order the crab puff which the sweet and sour sauce is amazing! Then I get the beef chow fun dried style and it's great. Tastes like my moms homemade chow fun. Although, the service isn't all that great, it makes up for the food. Definitely will always come again and again. Also everything is fairly decent priced. I didn't see anything over 20 dollars and they service roast duck, bbq pork, and fried pork which at some places can be expensive. Great place!

This place has very good food and definitely friendly servers. We were a group of 4 and even though it was super busy at the time that we went (Tuesday @ 7) during winter break; we were served really quickly and efficiently. Our server was amazing. He definitely deserves some stars. The food was well-seasoned. I went to Italy over the summer and I rather have these guys food.

This location is pretty crappy. There's a hotel that shares the parking lot so sometimes you won't have parking during dinnertime. It was just a group of 2, a friend and I at around 8:30, I realize it's a bar but it was way to loud. We were also sitting in the resturant area and not the bar area. There was 2 group of people watching basketball and causing a riot. I'm assuming they were drunks. The food was good, but the service was kind of crappy too. They didn't really pay attention to us and it took a while to flag someone down to get their attention. Definitely will not be returning.

This place has amazing food. We always come here whenever we crave pizza or Italian food. Their Alaskan King Crab pizza is to die for. They are sooo good. And their appetizers are great as well. The atmosphere around here is nice as well. They have good seating and also a bar too if you'd like to drink.

This place has some of the friendliest people I've met! Great customer service. I was looking to buy a new pair of glasses and been helped really quick. Although, all the glasses are a bit unorganized and messy, I can deal with it. They explained to me all the great add-ons I can get on my glasses and if I had any questions to let them know. Will come here again!

This place is awesome. Great scenery to sit and hang out with close friends and family. Their drinks are to die for, and plus they are so much cheaper than Starbucks! Talk about a win-win. I always order the chai tea here and it's great. Perfect hint of sweetness. They even taste better than Starbucks as well. I wish this place was a lil closer to my house because I would be going there every single day.  The workers are also nice, they aren't robots that are forced to talk to us about coffee. These people honestly care about how your day is going so far and they always start the discussion as well. They also give out great drinks if you haven't decided yet.

I love this place! They make great food and sandwiches. I always order their Jane baked potato and it's wonderful. Pricing wise isn't too bad either. I brought my cousins along and for all 3 of us the total was about 35 dollars and we all included a sandwich and a drink. Of course, they also offer free soft serve ice cream which is my favorite. Customer service here is great. Will definitely come again and again.

Love this place. Awesome food and a lot of different drinks to choose from. You can order pricey wine, or a good local beer. Their is also very good and always well done every time. Good place to hang out with friends, not such a family place, but definitely friends. Love the atmosphere as well, they display their drinks in a very cool way.

This place is great! I went there for the first time yesterday night with a group of 8 people. We went around dinner time which was around 6. We were sat down fairly quickly with a table that everyone could sit and talk with each other. It's a bit dark in there but it has a great environment. There are free chips and salsa (which was super nice that they had both mild and hot salsa). I ordered the chorizo con huveous (which is chorizo with eggs). Their portion is huge! It was only 10 dollars but I definitely left stuffed. It had 2 flour tortilla and also rice and beans. Everything tasted amazing and our server was very nice and professional. He never let us have a glass empty. Definitely will come again!

Since I cannot give them no stars, they get one from me or else I wouldn't have given them anything. I had horrible food poisoning from this location twice. I went on 2 different days and ordered different things and I have gotten sick both times. One time almost required me to go to the ER. I honestly think it's because they don't switch out their meats and I'm assuming they are getting spoiled. Will not be coming to this place ever. This place makes me never want Subway again. Haven't had it since the food poisoning.

Went here for a date night with my boyfriend and it was definitely a success. We were greeted promptly and got a seat right away (even though we did make reservations). Our server was amazing. I, unfortunately, forgot her name. She was very knowledgeable and since I was new there she definitely helped me out on what the Melting Pot was all about. The food and drinks came out very promptly and she always had my drinks refilled before it even ran out. She always seem to care about us and if we were unhappy with anything to let her know and she will fix it right away.  The food was amazingly delicious. This place definitely is great for a cute date night. :)

I love this place! They have reclining seats which makes watching a movie heck of a lot more comfortable. Their rooms are a bit small and doesn't have too much movie options but that's okay with me. It's in a good location with some shopping and restaurants too. Will come again!

If I could call this place heaven, I would. Every time I head for phoenix, I make sure I visit this place. Been going here for years and it hasn't disappointed me once. Their food is delicious and CHEAP. So far to me they are the cheapest Vietnamese food around. Here's what I can get for about 40 dollars and that's with 3 people. An appitizer, pho for each person, drinks, and also dessert! That's a lot of food for a fantastic price. Will always go here until I basically die.

The food here is really good, but the service isn't that great. Half of the time they don't even speak English and acknowledge us when we needed more drinks. We ordered about 5 plates and they were delicious (Peking duck, fried crab, beef chow fun, steamed fish, and chow mein), we also had 2 sodas and our bill was about 125 dollars. I think the food might be a lil overpriced but it's fine with us because the food here is great. Definitely will come again for the food but not the service. It was basically nonexistent.

This place is really nice! A lil bit small but we didn't wait too long. Our server was really nice and knowledgable on her beer selection. The food here is big!! You do get what you paid for. I ordered the Alfredo Fettichine with sausage and it was delicious and I had left overs the next day. They also give you complimentary bread rolls and they are heavenly. We also ordered a Creme Brulee and boy, oh, boy was it good. Overall, I like this place, might be a lil bit more expensive. Definitely will come back!

This place is great. Anything BBQ from this place is amazing. Meat is soft and tender and the sauce is just perfectly sweet. We ordered the BBQ platter, pulled pork sandwich, fish and chips, and 3 drinks for about 40 dollars. Which isn't too bad because the food quantity is a lot!! The fish and chips from here isn't too bad, it's a lil bit on the salty side but I ain't complaining. Will definitely come again!

If you're a sushi lover then you came to the right place. For 22 dollars a person, you have all you can eat sushi. They have a good list of them too. The sushi always come out fresh and delicious. There hasn't been a sushi that I didn't like. There is a missing star because their customer service could be a lot better. I wish they could be more friendly. Other than that, it's definitely a good place to come over for sushi.

I've been here for about 2 years and I really like this school. Everything is placed properly and walking from class to class isn't too bad. Parking is heck of a lot better than MCC. Usually by noo , parking is a pain but it's not that awful. I really like here and can't wait to join their nursing program.

I love their chicken, that's why I'll give them a star. Horrible service. I waited for about 45 minutes until I was helped in the drive through. There were only five cars and I had to wait around 20 minutes to finally get my order taken and some girl said, give me a sec and I said that's fine. 20 minutes later again, I waited, there was no cars in front of me. I was so angry I just drove to their window and finally they took my order. Can't believe how rude they were. She didn't even say sorry and that's all I wanted was an apology. Best believe, I will never be coming back.

This place is amazing!!!! The fish was definitely fresh and fried to perfection. It's super good. The fries were also delicious with enough crunch. The sauce is fantastic. It's kind of like a spicy sweet and sour sauce. Price isn't too bad either. We got a 4 piece fish and chip with a small drink and it was barely under 10 dollars. Will come again whenever we crave fish and chip!

I love this place. They don't half assed their jobs and they get everything right the first time. Their prices aren't too bad as well. I went to go fix my front breaks and it was only 160 dollars compared to the 260 dollars the car dealership wants to charge me. I always recommend this place to friends and families. The one thing I like about going to this place is that if I have one car problem, that's all they will fix. They don't recommend stuff for me to fix unless it's necessary and worth the money. They don't lie and they also don't overcharge anything. Will always come here for anything that's related to my car.

This hotel isn't that bad for the price. You do get what you paid for. It's a little bit older of a hotel than the rest of the strip but it has everything you need still. Our room was in tower #1 and our room was big. I went with my parents so we had three people together. We had 2 queen beds and they were all really clean and nice. Our view wasn't too bad either - if you want a good view instead of walls and concrete, you need to go on a higher floor. We were on floor 26 and it passed all the walls and we could see the strip. Valet parking was good as well, it just gets full by around 6 or 7 and when valet is full, you can find decent parking around the hotel as well. The casino isn't too shabby and you can actually win sometimes there. We have been booking here for the last few trips to Vegas and I do recommend it to people.

This place has amazing food. We always come here for a special occasion when there's a lot of people and always order their family style dinners for like 80 dollars and we always have left overs too!! Their servers are professional and very nice. They don't get mad or ticked off when asking them questions. The food is great as well, they always come out fresh and delicious every time.

I love this place! Great comfort food. The only reason why they are missing a star is because the servers aren't too friendly. They usually are talking to each other in their own language and sometimes you need to flag them down if you want any type of attention. I wish this place was a lil bit bigger as well, sometimes the carts will hit the back of my chair and they wouldn't even say sorry or excuse me. They just keep going. Talk about rude. Other than that, the food is amazing, it's fresh, and probably one of the best dim sum I've had and I've had a lot.

This place is pretty awesome! I always come here for a football game and it's a great experience every single time. It's cool that sometimes if the weather is nice, they will open or close the roof which is such an added bonus. Only thing I don't really like about this place is how unorganized their parking is. Some guards has no idea what they are directing traffic to. It takes us about an hour to get out of the parking lot at an end of a game. Foods and drinks are expensive here which you should already know.

This is a nice gym, they definitely have a lot of machines to work out on and they also have racquetball courts as well that you do need to reserve ahead of time. Their bathrooms are always clean and nice and they have such a big locker room! They have a locker both big and small. They also have awesome classes you can take as well like Zumba, Yoga, and Cycling as well. They also have a basketball court too. I just wish they have stations that supplies cleaning stuff so I can wipe down the machines and other people can too.

I came here with a group of 6 people and it was alright. Came inside and had no idea what was going on. I just wish they were more organized. We went to the bar and decided to get some drinks and the bartender was really nice! Got a drink and decided to sit outside near the volleyball court which I think it's really cool how they have 2 courts, can play horseshoe, pool, and there's a lil playpen in the sand for kids. That's why they get one star. The servers here are not really that attentive. I had to flag someone down to get a menu and order food. The food wasn't too bad. My bf had the wings and he said it was really good. I ordered the beef sliders with onion rings. The onion rings are really good but the meat in the burger was really dry and barely has any taste. It's super under seasoned. You can bring kids here but they are all to be gone by 8. It's a different environment and vibes, it's fun, I just wish they had more friendlier people.

This place is awesome! I love all of their flavors and their boba is always fresh. I haven't tried their foods yet so I can't review about that. It's a great place to get boba fast. I got my boyfriend and a couple of friends as well obsessed with boba and it started at this place first. It's also at an affordable price as well. Love this place!

We went here usually on the weekends and for a family of 3 it's about 60 dollars each time. It's not bad with 20 dollars a person.  The food wasn't too bad, it's a great place for people that loves seafood. Their crab legs are fresh and tasted good. It didn't taste frozen. The place is clean and the servers are very nice, they always came and cleaned out the dishes, gave us napkins and always filled up our drinks. They have a sushi bar there as well. Definitely worth the money if you like buffets. I believe it is cheaper to come in the afternoon on weekdays.

If you come here, you MUST ORDER garlic knots. Those things are amazingly delicious. We went for lunch and it was super fast, had a group of 4 and everything went smoothly. Our server was super nice and efficient. We ordered the ham/pineapple and it was delicious. I wish there were more of this place around Arizona. We were in and out in half an hour. This place is awesome.

I love this place! It's so much fun! Although we don't really come here for the food, it doesn't taste all that great and it's expensive. We just come for the games and drinks! They have a great bar and they can literally make any drinks. Games are a blast! And they also have a very good collection of prizes in their shop too! They have lots of stuffed animals and all things for everyone. Great for a date!! Will come again!

This place is super good! There is a lot of food for the price you pay. I ordered the small volcano and it came with 2 pancakes, an egg (any way you like it), sausage link, and one bacon. I also ordered a side of roasted potatoes and they were delicious. They were fried with onions and peppers as well. He pancake is super good. It's also a cute place to go for brunch or even dinner and it's all served all day! Definitely will be my to go place for brunch from here on out!

Came here on a Wednesday night and everyone was super friendly. Got sat down right away, and our server was very professional. He answered any questions we might have. The food was delicious. I definitely came in with eyes bigger than my stomach. Had a lot of left overs. I ordered the pick 2 combination and it came with a nice side salad (either Cesar or House), then it came with another side (I got french fries), and then I chose the shrimp Alfredo and the coconut shrimp. Super good. Came out piping hot. Our server always make sure that our drinks were refill and we are always happy. Definitely will come again.

This place is what got me hooked onto sushi. I was never a very big fan of sushi until I came here. The food was amazing and super fresh. Their happy hour menu is pretty awesome too. Although, their sushi is a little bit more expensive than other places (you do get what you paid for here). It's expensive but their sushi is amazing.

This place is wonderful for sushi and at a decent price as well. Their happy hour is awesome. Half-off a lot of their appetizer and sushi as well. Their Vegas and Shrimp rolls are delicious. I literally could eat my weight in that. Their service is amazing too and she seemed knowledgeable in anything related to sushi so we followed up to her recommendation as well and loved all of it. Their desert is wonderful as well. Definitely will come here a lot more often.

This place is great. Sushi is always fresh and they are made right in front of you. I really like the layout of the place too. Tables around the convey belt and then there are tables on the sides as well. Food is delicious too and it's a great price. It ranges from 1-2 $ per plate. They also have desert as well. There are a lot of parking spots outside as well. Will definitely come again.

The only thing good about Texas Roadhouse is the bread. The bread is amazing. I wish I could eat my weight in that. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger (I know it's a steakhouse, hence why I did give it 2 stars instead of 1). It came with no sauce. Literally just a beef patty, cheese, and lettuce. The meat was dry and the bread came out soggy because of the melted cheese that was on top. For some reason it took forever for our food to come out. It took almost an hour and we went for lunchtime so there wasn't that many people. Our server didn't really seem to care for us and it took forever to get our drinks refilled. I did hear from my group that the steaks were good, but other than that, their food kind of suck. Will definitely be here for steaks (nothing else).

Came here on a Saturday night and was seated right away. Our server was horrible. She didn't really paid any attention to us and basically ignored us. She had our drinks order (didn't write it down) and 5 minutes later came back and told us she forgot our order. I ordered the Bayou Po'Boy and it was alright. I think they do use frozen shrimp because my shrimp tasted really funky. Although, the beer battered onion rings was amazing! It tasted so good. Then, our server never came with silverware and we asked her to bring us some and we had 4 people at our table with things that needs to be picked up by silverware and she only brought 2 over. Really? Come on now! Then, she gave us the bill and we never saw her again even though we stayed and talked for a lil bit. She definitely ruined our night. Might not come here for a while.

This place is excellent. Fresh food and veggies, can't get any better than that. I love their #1 which is a combo of everything. It's delicious. Their egg rolls are also yummy too. It has a good crispness to it and also it's great flavor. Their servers are also extremely nice and welcoming as well every time my family and I went there. I love the fact that there is a pho house close to my very own house. It's even better when their food is delicious. It's a win win for my family and I. Great place!

This place is great. A lot of nice workers. I came at 6pm and was seated fairly quickly. They had a lot of things on their menu including appetizers, salad, soup, seafood, and burgers. I ordered the potato skins and they were delicious (crunchy skins). Then I ordered the chicken tenders and the batter was really good. I just wish it was beer battered. Other than that, the environment is great. Theirs unlimited warm buttery rolls and peanuts on the floor. Also! Country music is always playing! What can be better than that?!

Portion size is really good, I always get left overs taken home. Price-wise isn't too bad either. I always come here with my boyfriend, and for 2 people, with drinks, one appetizer, and 2 entrees bill comes up to about 25 dollars. I don't think that's too shabby. Will come again!

I love this place. This place is awesome for food, friends, and drinks. Their pasty is wonderful. I wish I knew about this place a lot sooner so I could have eaten their more often. I always order their cheese burger pasty and its just amazing. Everything about it is delicious. I can't find one wrong thing about this place at all. Their drinks are awesome and at a good price as well. The environment is pretty darn cool. It's definitely an Irish pub so if its super packed (Friday-Saturday night) be prepared to be sitting by someone, but that's how we made some wonderful friends as well that night. Definitely will be going there again and again until I probably die.

This place is great! We went on a Friday night and it was busy but since we were a party of 2, it went by fast for us. Our server was really cool and sweet to us. We ordered a root beer float, a beer, fish and chips, and a 10oz sirloin all for 40 dollars. Their fish and chips is super good, it's beer battered and has the perfect crunch to it. It was served with cold slaw and French fries but I substitute it for sweet potato fries instead. My bf said the steak had really good flavoring but it has a lot of gilet (which is hard pieces of meat), not the best steak ever. It came with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. Overall, it's a great place to for chow down on bar food. It is a loud environment (hence bar) but there are a lot of TVs and a cool place to hang. Will come again!

Definitely a great place to grab some quick chinese food. Everything is fresh and simply well cooked. You also get a great amount of food for a very decent price. I ordered the sweet and sour shrimp with lo mein and it was simply delicious and has great flavor. I will come again and again whenever I am in the area. The crab Angels were soooo good; that's definitely a must order for everyone. Yummy!

The service was great but the food was gross. I ordered the Red Robin Royale and it comes with a sunny side egg and my egg still had the white part uncooked. It was disgusting. The egg was broken apart on my burger and it was very unpleasant to the eyes. The first batch of fries I get was cold and hard, but after my refill, it was great. Service was great. Food came in on time and my drink was always full but the food was just unacceptable to me.

Great little place for some frozen yogurt. Their flavors always change so you have a lot of different and new options every week. The toppings area always look clean and very well organized. You don't see the cereal mixing in the with the boba. Definitely great service as well, all the people that work there is super friendly too.

This place is awesome! I just barely knew about this place not too long ago. The atmosphere is very cozy and nice. It's a great place to hang out with good friends. Their wines are delicious, a lil on the expensive side, but of course, to get good wine it has to be pricey. Their food is so yummy. We ordered their bruschetta which had a whole lot of different toppings you can choose from. We also had a sandwich as well which was delicious. Love this place and will come again and again.

Love this place! Went to grab a Pikachu stuffed bear and everyone was really sweet. The two girls that helped me was very friendly. Will come again because of the great customer service we had. :)

This place is like every other Natives, serves really good food and wings. Their placement on tables and seats are kind of weird. We were seated at a table that's right next to the door.

I came here to wax my eyebrows and she didn't really do a great job and it was expensive. I could have went to the nail salon that's down the street for cheaper and they probably would do a better job. The girl that did it for me seemed to be very lost and half the time she didn't know where any of her equipment was. It also took an hour for her to wax my eyebrows which is a lil too long for me. The reason why I give it 2 stars is because of the environment. The bed I laid on was soft and also played peaceful music as well.

Love this place. Yummy food for such a great price. Lots of TVs as well to be able to see different games at the same time.

This place is really good for a bowl of ramen. Their serving is large too, I always have leftovers whenever I'm done. Their boba is really good too (tapioca always taste fresh and chewy). I always order their original ramen and a side of shrimp and veggie tempura. Their tempura is really good here. Although their price might be a lil high, it's good food and plenty as well. I'll come again and again!

This place has great food. I love the environment. It's hip and trendy. I love that it's open 24/7 on the weekends. That means I could get crepes at like 2 in the morning. I ordered the number 9 crepe which has chicken, bacon, and a delicious compote. It's definitely savory and filling. The price is also not too bad. It's great for the food quality you're getting. We ordered 2 drinks, 3 crepes, and a bowl of french fries for about 30 dollars. Not too shabby. Will come again and again when I'm in the area. Too bad there's not one by my house because I would have come every single day!

This place is great for a group of friends for dinner. Their food is delicious. I ordered the fish and chips and it's plenty of food. We also ordered drinks as well and it wasn't too bad of a price. Great place and it's nicely decorated. Love it!

This place is awesome!! I went to Italy and got homemade fresh gelato last summer and this place hits home for me. The best place in Arizona to get gelato as close as the  homeland. There's always a line that goes outside the door so be aware of that but the wait is definitely worth it. I always get the coffee gelato and its simply delicious. Will always go here again and again. They definitely got me to be a regular here!!

This place is awesome when it comes to healthy eating. I'm not really a fan of healthy food so when it makes it taste more like a dessert, I was super happy! I got the peanut butter and it was fantastic. The portion are also really good. For $5.00, I was really full and satisfied with what I had. The customer service wasn't the best, they weren't too friendly, hence the -1 star. Other than that, it was a cool place. There are a lot of tables to sit and chat as well, and there are tables outside too. I will be coming again!

This place was great. The customer service was really nice and everyone was friendly. Our foods came out really promptly and hot which is a plus with Italian food. The environment was really clean and well decorated. Will come again!

This place is great. The food always come out cooked great and the servers are all friendly. No complaints here. I always order the vib breakfast and it comes out in big portion unlike some other village inn. Their pies here are always delicious. I always order the whole banana cream pie and its always great.

This place is great for a quick sushi lunch! The workers there were really nice. I had a question about something on the menu and they answered everything very professionally and without any attitude. The place is super clean too and has a great layout. I ordered the shrimp and veggies tempura and it was really crunchy and yummy. The batter held on really well and the sauce that came with it was also good too. I also ordered half a crunch roll (which came with 5 pieces) and it was really, really yummy! The reason why I didn't give them the perfect score is because the price was a lil too high for me to come over a lot. For all I ordered and a small drink was about 17 dollars and I think that's a lil high. Overall, besides price, I would definitely come again for the food and the great customer service I received.

I really like this place. It's close to my house and the people that works there are great. One of the main reason why I like this place is that I don't feel nervous when I'm here. The people that comes comes to workout and then leave. Nobody really hogs the machine and the weights are always placed back nicely. Great place to work out and great people too.

I went here because I saw how many positive reviews it had and I wish I could say what they are saying but I don't agree. The food was a lil expensive for what I was getting. The food itself wasn't all that impressive either. I ordered the Hash Brown burrito and it was a mess. It had bacon, sausage, hash browns, sour cream. and eggs. I wish that every bite I had would have all of those things. I would have already ate half the burrito and I'm barely starting to taste the bacon. I really wanted to like this place but I can't. I rather stick with Filibertos that's across the street.

This place will be my new favorite place! Their food is delicious! I ordered a combo #3 for the cranberry turkey sandwich. It included a drink, chips, salad, and also a pastry/dessert for under 10 dollars! The sandwich and the dessert was great. This place is also very cute and nicely decorated. When I went there it was clean and very nice. Will definitely go again!

This place is great! It was my first time a couple nights ago after a friend recommended this establishment. It's such a chill place to hang out and drink. There's tv everywhere that all has some sort of sports channel on. Their beer collection is pretty extensive, I think there was over 50 beers or so on tap. The food menu and dessert menu is kind of small, but the food portion is huge!!! I ordered the fish and chips and substituted for onion rings instead. The fish was excellent. I went to London to have real fish and chips and have been looking for a place that was somewhat close to London and this is the place. Although, I wouldn't order the onion rings again, the batter on it doesn't really stick so you're eating more onion than you are batter. I will probably order the sweet potato fries, stole a couple of them off of my bf plate and it was delicious. Overall, food is great, drinks are great. Will come again!

I went through the drive thru and everything was fast and efficient. I just can't believe how expensive they are and the little food you get. I can't believe it costed me about 20 dollars for a half a sandwich and a drink. Definitely not coming here again for a quick lunch.

This place is really yummy. I ordered the pina colada snow and it's delightful especially when it's hot outside. The reason for the minus one star is the workers weren't all that friendly. Other than that, everything was great. Will come again.

This place is awesome. You can basically make your own 11 inch pizza for about 8 dollars. You can anything based on your preferences in meat, cheese, and sauce. You get basically everything with a soda for less than 10 dollars and their food is great too! The place always look clean and everyone is really professional. Definitely will go again!

I always come here when there's a play I'm going to at Gammage and it's not that bad. They might be a little bit more on the expensive side and they don't really have that much food either. They have about 10 signature dishes and then there are sides and drinks as well as dessert. I always order the minimum wage breakfast and it's really good, comes with 2 eggs (however you like it), sausage or bacon, potatoes, and toast - but I always subsitute it for their red velvet waffle. Their red velvet waffle is seriously to die for. It's soooooo good. Overall, food was great. But the service was kind of slow, and there wasn't that much people there every single time I went there; other than that, place is good.

This place is really good. I ordered a bacon and cheese steak burger and it came out delicious. I substituted their fries for onion rings and it's yummy although it's more towards the salty side. I ordered the dirt and worm custard which had vanilla custard with bits of Oreos and gummy worms. The environment is super cute. I feel like I was in the 60s at a diner. Will come here again!

This place is great!! The food is delicious and it's actually not bad pricing. My total bill was about 15 dollars but that includes fries, drink, and dessert. That's a great deal!!

This place is awesome. Their donuts and foods are always fresh out of the oven each time. And it's cheap!! Can't go wrong when it's only 6 dollars for a half dozen of donuts and a dozen of donut holes. Will always come again to this place and it's even more awesome that this place is close to home too.

This place is great! It's a big building so no matter what time you come, you'll definitely be seated. For under $10 it's basically all you can eat pizza, pasta, salad, and dessert, and a drink as well. The food tasted good for the price. And they have different options to everything as well. You can pick your pasta and sauce, and their salad bar looks clean and up kept. Their desserts are delicious. Definitely go for the oreo or cookie dough one. Went with a friend and it was a good time.

This place is great. Their boba is always soft and tender. I always get the original (basic milk tea with honey boba) and it tastes really good. Pricing over here is decent too. For 2 fat cups, it was only 10 bucks! The cups are more than enough for me. I can't wait to explore other flavors too. It's a great spot, will definitely come again!

This place is great! They always have new flavors to try and their toppings are so good. They actually have Dole pineapple! The same taste you get at Disneyland here! The service people here are really nice too, haven't met a mean face yet. Will always come here whenever I have a sweet tooth!
