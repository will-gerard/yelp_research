I recently found out I was pregnant and was researching OBGYNs in my area (Downtown Phx) I tried out this place because it was right near my house and the reviews seemed ok.  From the moment I got to the office I was already turned off and regretted coming here, I arrived 15 mins early and filled out all my paperwork and STILL waited for an hour just to be seen! Everyone in the waiting room was called before I was and I wasn't even seeing my actual Dr, I was assigned a PA instead.  I did the usual Urine sample, and they took my blood and vitals but the PA kept asking me questions I already answered to the nurse which made me notice she wasn't even looking at my file nor had it with her, she was just taking notes on the Patient info sheet I filled out.  She breezed through a low quality ultrasound and I had to ask her for pics which were blurry and barely even worth printing when I saw them.  She explained that I would be going to a different facility in 2 weeks for the ultrasound and then go back to their office for the check up which I wasn't happy about having to go to multiple places but understood.  When she finished I had to ask her about the results of the UA since I told her I felt like I may have a UTI, she told me everything looked fine but they would have to send it out to get those results (I've never heard of not getting UTI results the same day) and that she would just send a script for an antibiotic to my pharmacy which would be ready when I left there and that they would call in a couple days and tell me the results and I could stop taking them if they were negative.  I waited until the next day to go to the Pharm and no script was sent, I called the OBGYN and explained there was supposed to be a script for an antibiotic and they said they would send it over. the next day the pharm called to tell me my script for prenatal was ready but that was all that was sent. I didn't even ask for prenatals since they're over the counter!!!! called the DR AGAIN and had it sent over, still no call from the Dr regarding my results but I thought I would wait another day.  still a week later and 3 calls asking for my results and I had to call THEM to find out that the results had been in and are negative but the PA must have overlooked needing to call and let me know.  I have requested my file and am switching to Maricopa OBGYN, I'm very disappointed in my first prenatal Dr visit as this should be a happy time and your doctor should make you feel comfortable, I hope Maricopa can turn this around and make it a positive experience for me as it should be.

I have been going to this place since I was little with my grandparents and my parents. Everytime I stayed the night with Grandma and she asked what I wanted for dinner and my response was ALWAYS "May Garden", so I would get on her rotary phone (that was my play toy) and invited Patrick Swayze to come with us lol. We've been going there so long now that the owner Grace knows us and always asks about the family if they aren't with us. Aside from being a great family owned and locally owned restaurant the food is what keeps us coming back. They have never changed any items over the years and it always tastes amazing! I've never really been into buffets but this place is the exception.  Their fried rice is made with Pork which is not typically standard so that's nice and the egg rolls are the crispy fully loaded ones, but the best dish IMO are the RIBS!!! Omg fall off the bone-melt in your mouth-juicy ribs. They are super quick for take out and always stack your to go plate full of food so you always get your money's worth and can feed like 3 people on 1 order.

I wanted a facial and eyebrow wax one day and was looking for a place that could fit me in same day, I was very excited when this place was able to get me in and asked what time would work best for me.  The salon was very easy to find and the receptionist was very friendly. I saw Brandi for my appt and she took time to ask about my skin concerns as well as educated me on the products she would be using. She took the time to ask me how I liked my brows shaped which i really liked and was VERY pleased with the outcome.  The facial was THE best!!  Everything was so relaxing and she was great conversation too ;)  All the products felt great on my skin and smelled so refreshing, She even gave me an arm massage while the mask was doing it's job on my skin :) :) When I was done she showed me the products she used at the counter that were available for me to purchase. She recommended one that I should use in my daily routine but was not pushy in the sale at all which I really liked and I did end up buying it (Rosewater Toner and it's AMAZING)  I have recommended this place to all my friends and will continue to take my brow and facial needs to Brandi as long as she works here!!

Service was horrible! We waited over an hour for our food and our server Alexandra never assured us it was coming anytime soon. THEN she forgot my friends salad and entree altogether which she never even apologized for or reflected it on the bill. This place doesn't split checks which they don't tell you until you notice only one check is placed in front of you so after an already long dinner we had to have everyone add up what they owed and write it on the bill. The food was ok but by the time it came we had mostly lost our appetites. Def never going here again and wouldn't recommend it to friends

I bought my lamp and matching buffet table (which I use as an entertainment center) from here and the price was def fair considering the quality of both pieces. The man at the counter was very friendly and helpful and even loaded the furniture into my vehicle for me.

Pleasantly surprised when I walked in looking to get some tacos and they had mariscos on the menu!! The chips and salsa were delicious as well and the prices were super reasonable.  I'm always searching for a good authentic Mexican food place and this is DEF it!  I live right down the street so I will be frequenting this place more often :)

I live down the street from this restaurant and was so ecstatic when I came upon it!!  The thing I love the most about an Asian place is the egg roll and the fried rice, this place DEF has the best in both!  I usually switch up my orders every once in awhile and have yet to eat anything I didn't like there.  The staff is quiet but friendly and the complex isn't the best but the food makes up for all that.

A friend of mine brought me here since we both work in the area and I wanted sushi, I've heard this place is DELICIOUS so I was excited to try it. We ordered 3 rolls (Cowgirl, Las Vegas, Spicy Tuna). I know the Lv and the ST are pretty standard so you really can't mess those up but I chose the cowgirl and had them omit the scallions...so it was Spicy Yellowtail(my fav), topped with sliced yellowtail, spicy mayo and sriracha. SO glad I chose that roll because it was scrumptious!! My friend had never eaten yellowtail before so he was glad to try it and really liked it as well. I will def be going back to this place and can't wait to try more specialty rolls

I decided to give this place a try despite all the bad reviews, I was in the area and they were able to get me in without a wait. The place is nicely decorated and the girls were all very personable. I showed Christeen my tech a photo of a design I wanted on my gel manicure and she was able to replicate it perfectly :) while my hands were drying in the top coat stage she even came over and gave me an AMAZING shoulder massage!!   Customer service is always top for me and this place def won me over, glad I decided to not listen to everyone else this time around.

I've been here a couple of times before but just grabbed a coffee to meet up with someone. Today I decided to try working remotely here from my laptop and was disappointed in numerous things....First of all there was jelly and crumbs on the table where I wanted to setup so I grabbed a napkin and cleaned it off myself. No biggy, maybe they had a busy breakfast and hadn't gotten to cleaning yet. So I setup and noticed there were no power outlets near any of the tables so I had to move to the bench area with no table as that was the only power outlet I saw. There was still a few plates and cups left from the previous customers but I just moved them down a bit and got to working. An hour passes and the girls behind the counter have been so loud laughing and talking about snapchat to each other that they haven't even come out from behind the counter to clean any of the tables or the mess that has been sitting for who knows how long now. They can't be too busy at this point because I am 1 of 4 patrons in the whole place but it is almost lunch time and you would think they would want to get the place clean and ready for the new customers. Finally the barista comes over and cleans all of the empty plates and cups but doesn't actually wipe any of the space down. The wifi cut out at least 3 times while I was working so there really is no reason for me to go back to this place. There are other coffee shops in the area that have comparable coffee, better service and accommodate guests wanting to work from their laptops.

I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and am so happy I finally did!! The BEST hotdogs downtown and I love the idea of using pita instead of a bun.  Really cute ambiance with a vintage feel and they even sell Mexican Coke and Big Red out of the bottles.  My friend had the Bloody Mary and said it was the BEST he's had in a long time.

I always come here for an oil change, the staff is very friendly and the waiting area is big with a TV. They even have wifi so I can bring my laptop and work while my car is getting serviced :)

Came to just get a quick polish change and a massage since I JUST got a pedicure and didn't need anything trimmed. I was in the area and needed to kill some time so I asked if she could just do that. The lady said no. Just a polish change and no massage. So you would rather not have my business at all then give me a few dollars off of the price of a full pedicure?! I even asked her if she could just give me a special price for just that. She said no....poor business skills

Who likes taking a day off work to get your oil changed or get something on your car fixed?!  Shane and his staff are super friendly and they come pick your car up, take car of what needs to be done and then they return it by the time you need it to go home from work.  Shane is always up front and honest about the work needing to be done and has never been wrong or made me feel like I was being taken advantage of.  I have sent a few of my friends to him and will continue to do so :)

I decided to get my nails done last minute on Sunday so I called ahead to make sure they would be able to take me when I got there, luckily they were.  They have a great selection of gel colors and so far the quality is great and they seem to be the best priced in the area as well. I only have great things to say about this place, everyone was so welcoming and I enjoyed chatting with Tran who did an AMAZING job on my mani. The color application is flawless and all of my nails are filed evenly which is a huge factor for me. I'm looking forward to going back in for a pedicure this week and will continue to take my service to Tran :)

I'm 16 weeks pregnant and was having trouble finding an OBGYN that would take my new Obamacare insurance (thanks a lot....) but that's another story.... A friend of mine referred me to Dr. Shah and so I called the office and they took my insurance YAY!  The best part was that they were so nice on the phone and even got me in same day. When I arrived I'll admit the outside looks like a dump and I almost regretted making an appt here but then I knew my friend wouldn't send me here if it wasn't a great place.  To my surprise the office is BEAUTIFUL and clean when you walk in, it's basically a diamond in the rough.  The girl at the desk remembered me from the call and was so nice!  I waited maybe 2 mins after filling out the new patient paperwork before getting called to the back and waited mot even 5 mins in the room before Dr Shah came in for my visit. He remembered my friend and explained his background with me which I really liked and he made me feel very comfortable and I knew I was in good hands. He answered all my questions and even told me the sex of my baby (85% sure) even though I'm only 16 weeks along. The overall experience was more than I could have asked for especially since I had a HORRIFIC experience with another OBGYN for my first appt (See my Central PHX OBGYN review).  This place was the saving grace and I couldn't have asked for better.

I just moved downtown and take both of my dogs here just about every day. I have a large and small dog so I take them to the large area and all of the dogs seem to get along, so far I haven't had a problem. As someone else mentioned they are always low on bags so I save my grocery bags and donate them to the park.  It would be nice if they could add wifi somehow so I could bring my laptop and work from one of the benches :)

I have tried numerous nail salons since moving to the west valley a year ago and have FINALLY found one that I love! Teresa and her staff are so friendly and inviting, they know the current nail trends and make sure you are getting exactly what you pay for. You can tell they are a great salon because all the customers in the shop were  all longtime customers and everyone was sharing in conversation and laughing like in a barbershop. Great atmosphere, very nice and funny staff with excellent work. Couldn't ask for more :)

The chipotle of pizza!!! You build your own pizza, wait about 10-15 mins and your personal pizza is ready to eat.  I don't know what they put in the crust but the flavor was the best I've ever tasted. I'm simple so I just get basic pepperoni and add lots of cheese and jalapeños. I ate almost the entire pizza to myself so if you are thinking about sharing I would advise to just order your own
