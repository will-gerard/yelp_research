One of my favorite places in the whole city. The prices are a little high, but cute shop inside for creative gifts good atmosphere.

If I could give zero stars I would. This company came recommended to me by my apt complex... I made an appointment TWICE and they didn't show up TWICE. After the first time, they were so apologetic saying this never happens, so I decided to give them another chance - purely off the convenience of not having to call another company and they didn't show up AGAIN. Forget it! Don't waste your time!

Super cute nail salon! Prices were fair and a wide variety of colors. Great customer service... The girls were very cute as well. I'll definitely be going back

Skinny Wimp was a great choice in moving companies for me! Eric and Jahan were super professional. They were quick and efficient. They wrapped up all of my furniture and couldn't have expected anything more! Thanks! I'd recommend:)

To be honest they seem very shady here. Always trying to upsell. They did a good job on the detail AFTER I complained and had the manager come take a look. I used to come here a lot bc it was near by but it's just not worth. Plus the workers in drying area cat call and stare at you.
