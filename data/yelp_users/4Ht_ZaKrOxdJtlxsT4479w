I love this place, however a friend and I stopped in on Friday night 05/27/16 at 11pm and no one greeted us, so we went out to the patio because we saw the waiter out talking to patrons.   We sat down at a table as the waiter proceeded to put all the chair up under the wall mounted TV's. He asked us if we were watching the one tv that was on, and we said no. He turned it off, and didn't ask us if we needed drinks. So I went into the bar.   The bartender was surprised to see someone standing at the bar and apologized because they were all busy doing closing work. I asked if the bar was closing and he said " no we have to stay open until 2 am.  I asked if the kitchen was opened and he said yes for another 1/2 an hour. He gave me a menu and gave me the drinks I ordered. He did help me carry the drinks and menu to the table on the patio where we were sitting.   20 minutes went by and the waiter was still busy closing up the patio and doing side work. He never acknowledged us, and the bartender came out and wanted to know if we were going to order before the kitchen closed. We said no, because we had decided to leave, and we felt ignored like they wanted us to leave.   I totally love this bar for brunch and happy hour, but for a Friday night in the future, I will probably choose somewhere else to spend my money.

I could eat here everyday. This place has the best, most fresh, locally grown salads ever. The sodas are all natural and the best I've ever tasted. Glad to have Mad Greens in the Valley.
