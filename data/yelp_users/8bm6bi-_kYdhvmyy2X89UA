Mi amor! I see the Stetson Chopped Salad in my dreams, a must-try dish. Fantastic wine and cozy atmosphere make Cowboy Ciao a Scottsdale staple.

My favorite neighborhood hang-out! Amazing selection of beer and they even have wine. Food is always fresh and delicious. The vibe is relaxed and not pretentious. Most of all, they have amazing service, friendly servers and staff.

Intimate bar with a great pool table and attentive staff. Food was average for a bar. Would go back, just because service was awesome.

This place has gone down hill in the past year. My first few experience were wonderful, but recently service and quality has not improved and even the portions have gotten smaller. Disappointed in the direction they are going.

My dish was bland, service wasn't great. There are plenty of other great Thai spots in Mesa & North Phoenix, I would go elsewhere. Not worth the price. The place was empty and the quality still wasn't even close to par.

Amazing Adobo and cold beer (not lukewarm from Circle K...eww.), what else do you need? Great service and quality meats. I will return!

Amazing service, creative dishes and wonderful local wine. Wish I could dine here every day of the week! It is a Downtown Phoenix gem, I will return.

All of the dishes have so much flavor! Service is quick and the place is spotless. Try the Mikas Fries if you are feeling adventurous. I love the modern feel of Mikas and if you like Siracha, you will be in heaven.

I love this location and the patio is spacious (and dog friendly!) Try the Breakfast Buzz shake, AMAZING.

Amazing sweet potato tots, and I don't even like sweet potatoes. Burger was done properly, parking can be a little bit rough during peak hours tho.

I really want to love this place, but I have had much better Pho elsewhere. Staff wasn't fully trained. I specifically asked for NO tripe, yet it was included in my dish. This location has potential, but needs to work out the kinks before I return.

The spam musubi is delicious and very affordable. Probably my favorite dish besides the sliders. Coffee was delicious and strong! I really enjoy this place, no matter what time of day/night. Check out happy hour here too, you will love it.

One of those places that just hits the spot. I would give it 5 stars, but sometimes the portions and quality are not consistent.
