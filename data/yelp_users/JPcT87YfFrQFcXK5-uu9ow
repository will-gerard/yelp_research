I'm giving 2 stars because the food is usually pretty good. They have great wings and some of the best ranch in town. I don't like posting negative reviews but I just can't let this slide. Heres the short of the long: A couple months ago a friend of mine and I went to zipps for wings and nachos. Service was incredibly slow. As servers saw us, they failed to acknowledge our presence and finally a girl came from the back and looked shocked that we were there and waiting for service. She approached our table without an apology or anything to say for us having waited for 10/15 minutes to be greeted after we sat. So, they can absolutely improve their teamwork and help each other out a bit. Then, after placing our order, it arrived. Everything looked great and we were ready to dig in. I had my wings and my friend had her nachos. As I looked at her basket, I noticed what looked like an extra long and big black ant perusing around from the bottom of her nachos. Mind u, we hadn't started eating but we were excited to. At this point, we had asked to speak to the manager and he said "it's probably just a small bug or something that was in the basket before they plated the nachos. It's harmless". Ummmm...I'm not eating anything if a bug (at least a half inch and ugly) comes crawling out of the food. The manager said that all he could do was remove the nachos from the bill. That's not ok! Neither of us had much of an appetite and would not be touching our food. He stated that he would call the higher-up and see if it would be ok to take care of our tab. Sure enough, the answer was only the nachos will be removed from the total. I was shocked. I got the owner or GM's card and called while getting no where. I would call the corporate office and he'd be at the restaurant. I'd call the restaurant and he'd be at corporate. This went on and on and I gave up. Unfortunately,  Zipps has lost my business. I would bring several people with me quite often and our tabs were in the hundreds. We always took care of the staff as well. It's a shame that over $8 wings, they've lost hundreds and even thousands in revenue. Sad that it amounted to this but it truly could've all been avoided if the manager did the right thing or at least if the GM could've returned one of my several calls. I'm appalled by the lack of integrity by this place. A few years ago (at Zipps), a cocaroack ran across the top of my table and the manager felt so bad that he gave us Zipps money to come back and took care of the tab. I came back because I knew they cared and wanted to believe that it was an isolated incident. Not anymore. Bahbye Zipps.

Jade Palace has always been my pick for Chinese cuisine. It is always consistantly delish. I tend to place orders for delivery and from the second they answer the phone with a smile (I hear it through the phone) and take my order. It always comes when they say it will and its always hot and fresh. The delivery man is also great. Always says hi to the dogs and always seems happy to be working. Its a refreshing thing to know that some people do take pride in their work.  I would recommend Jade Palace to anyone who wants great food and great service.

So, the restaurant that my friend is always raving about was where we went. Basilico was an experience from the second I walked through the door. As a lover of Italian food, if it's not authentic, it's not for me. My meal was by far the best Italian food I've had in years! Other than the food, the ambiance was perfect. Very friendly yet professional. I knew I was in for a treat the second i smelled the toasted bread and the refreshing pesto. I ordered the chicken parm and every bite got better. So tender and delish. My friend had me try her penne with vodka sauce and I will say that it was definitely the best vodka sauce ever! The pasta was al dente and so fresh...yummm  If you want true authentic Italian in Scottsdale, hands-down Basilico does it right.

I've had my dog for 16 years and two dogs for the past 3 years. I spoil my dogs and shop for them more than I do for myself and I must say, I've never been to a pet store with a kinder staff. Amanda was hands down the most knowledgeable person I've ever spoken to at a pet store. She took time to explain what she would recommend for my 16 year old pit that can chew through anything in a short amount of time. With her reaching her latter years in life, I wanted to give her something that she would be able to play with for hours without ripping apart and with out ingesting. I've tried soooooo many things! Amanda knew exactly what I was in search of and gave me a few options. I ended up going back to the store an hour later to purchase more and my dogs have never been happier. Thank you Amanda for a your time and compassion for my situation. You made a huge difference and I would recommend this pet store to anyone seeking great customer care and wholesome products.

I couldn't have any more praise for Michael who works at this location. I've had some not so fabulous experiences at this location and on 2 occasions, Michael has made good on them. Although my vehicle can probably use a little extra dry time and often has water dripping off the back, I continue to support this place with my fast pass membership because let's face it - good customer service is hard to find. Oh, and if Michael sees you pass through the wash and sees that water is dripping, he runs over with a cloth and dries to your satisfaction. I've been there when he's not working and it's not the same experience. All in all, it's convenient, a pretty good wash and great customer service.
