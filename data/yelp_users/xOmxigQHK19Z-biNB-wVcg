I stopped into this place to check it out since I've seen nothing but great reviews.  I walked in to find cute little gifts (voodoo doll key chains?!) jewelry, clothing, and other clever stuff.  I would say I was a little disappointed they didn't have more clothing, however I did manage to get a cute Daniel Rainn '70s blouse for $39 which was originally $145 (score!)  I guess I was lucky to walk in to the 75% Summer Sale!  The ladies were very helpful and attentive and I fell in love with pretty much all their clothes.  It's hard for me to justify Free People full retail price, but if I need to splurge I know where to go.  I'm planning on taking one of their classes in November (it's free!) and can't wait to frequent this place more often!

Love this place to get one of a kind gifts, great lattes, a solid omelette, take a cooking class or just to stop by after I've done some shopping at Poor Little Rich Girl.  It's like a coffee shop and home-goods boutique rolled into one.  One point of contention is how cramped the place is.  Every nook and corner is filled with something and waiting in line for your drink you feel in the way with people delivering food, getting drinks, or just browsing around.

If I had the ability to give this place 0 stars I would.  Absolutely horrible management.  I had to practically plead with management to fix a roach problem that had invaded my apartment.  After multiple times or going into the office to complain, finally the situation was resolved after having to go through "well the past company only comes out on Mondays."  BS!  I have a health hazard in my living space-I need things taken care of immediately!  Parking is atrocious, if you have anyone visiting you or if someone lives with you you'll never find a parking spot so it's better not to bother and just have no one visit you.  Area is ghetto and I've heard of multiple people's places being broken into.  I myself had an instance of a weird man staring into my window at night.  Creepy.  Air conditioning and how the apartments are built are shoddy as my electric was always obnoxiously high.  Multiple pools on the property which is great, however half the time there is a lock on the gate so you get in or they schedule pool maintenance and shut down the pool during the summer time.  This makes zero sense.  Security guards are on site-should be a clue.  Transients sleeping on the playground equipment in the morning, rummaging through your trash, yep sounds like a great place.  Wait, the security gates should keep all that riff raft out right?  Wrong, the gates work about 17% of the time. Upon moving out I knew I would have a clean up bill as my dog had done some damage to the apartment.  I receive a voicemail and email stating that I owe a large amount of money and that if I don't respond to them by that day they would send me to collections.  I never received any kind of letter or notification from them and certainly don't  expect to be treated by threats of collections agencies.  So glad to be done with this place.  Stay away front this place.  There are many other apartments, especially just north of this place that have mountain views and are in better areas.

Can't believe it's taken so long for me to comment on Shampoo Ink and my stylist Heidi!  I've made so many changes to my hair over the year from blonde to red to transitioning back to blonde and every change we've done I've received so many compliments.  It's hip but not too trendy to intimidate anyone.  I even recommended my boyfriend to give it a try for a professional cut and he loved the extra treatment he received from Heidi.  Heidi never pushes product, but will make suggestions when I need something.  Love this place and would suggest Heidi to anyone that needs a new stylist!

Howard Hughes was hilarious!  Great comedy and entertainment.  Service was ok and pricing on food was a little overpriced but we had a great time.  Will be back soon to see more shows.

Absolutely disgusted with the service and ethics of this company.  First of all I am cold called by an ADT sales rep (Michael)  Friday evening, pressure selling me to set up security for my new home.  I get it, I'm a salesperson as well. What I don't appreciate is the following: 1)scheduling for service to be the following day and no one calls or shows up. 2) The salesperson did not say he would be running my credit. I just purchased a home, I have multiple inquiries and the last thing I need is another pull on my credit.  At the very least, you should be up front with a client.  I'm pretty sure that's against the law actually.  3)  If I had not asked, would have been tricked into a 3 year service agreement.  Upon receipt of our conversation he hands me a sheet (which I have not signed by the way) saying that I've agreed to a 3 year service agreement.) Shady Shady Shady.  So I call on Wednesday after not hearing anything from the salesman or the company and speak to the salesman about the situation and he promises to fix the situation.  Two hours go by and no call or anything from the company.  By now I am livid.  I called to cancel service as the salesman tried some BS line of an excuse.  I don't care how many free months of your crappy service you offer me you have lost my business forever.  The last thing I need is  security company in my home who are unreliable and conniving liars.  I'd never do business with them and will tell everyone I know not to use their service.  Obviously this salesperson has no ethics and judging from the other reviews about his company it seems they are all a bunch of crooks.  Use a company that doesn't have service agreements and can't price increase you in the 2nd and 3rd year, has business integrity, and trustworthy service.  Something ADT obviously lacks.

This place is such a hidden gem.  Love everything here they make killer cocktails and pretty much anything else.  The patio is great and love the ambience.  I was a tad disappointed with the pizza I ordered, but lamb chops were good as well as the bruschetta but my favorite thing on the menu is the peach cobbler.  Yum!
