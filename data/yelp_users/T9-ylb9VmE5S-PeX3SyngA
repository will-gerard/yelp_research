This is such a let down to have to do this but I need to. I have been coming to az tip and toe for the last 2 1/2 years for my acrylics and gel overlay, and this is probably the worst it's ever been! I no longer have acrylics and now I just do gel manicures which is a lot simpler to do then the whole acrylic thing. I walked in about an hour ago and got a gel manicure as I sat down I realize that I was with a new guy. (not a big deal because I'm okay with newbies, everyone's gotta learn) But it was bad, he did not have any of his own equipment or tools and the lady next to him was giving him everything. Now when it came to putting my actual gel polish, I am looking at my nails right now my polish it does not go down to the sides of my nails, I have glitter all over my fingers, and to top it off they are still rough so I did not get enough of a topcoat. Because I now have to go to work I will have to find time to go back in and have my nails fixed! This is such a let down!

Do not go here at night! The parade themselves on being one of the only restaurants open late in old town, but yet they should change their hours. Every time we go in there before 11pm they somehow are closing. Just now no one was there to greet us, which is understandable seeing as it is late but as we walk to seat ourselves they tell from the bar we did last call. Consistency is what will make a break a restaurant, if your hours say that you are open until 12 then stay open until 12!

This is a great place for a group! The food come right out to be able to start grilling. The servers are very attentive, answer any questions, and help you with what you need. Will be coming back no doubt!!!

This place is amazing. It's an out of the box restaurant with the mom and pop feel. The ambience is peaceful and relaxing and the service was wonderful. And the food was out of this world!

Every time I come here it's nothing but helpful!!! I love these guys, I know nothing about bikes and when I have to drop off my boyfriends Fixie they get right to fixing it! We dropped it off yesterday and they said they would call us when it was ready. Probably Monday.... Two hours later they call and said it was ready to be picked up!!! They are awesome!!

Try a new spot with the girls tonight and I have to say this place is a gem!!! When we got there they sat us right away and got us taken care of.  I have the Crispy Brussels sprouts to start with, normally I'm not a fan of brussels sprouts because they're too salty but I was told to try these and boy did I make the right decision. It had the perfect balance and that goat cheese sauce was to die for.  Then I had the prime New York strip, it was so tender and had a perfect amount to char that I could still taste all the flavors of the meat!!!! Overall, I would have to say if your looking for a nice place that knows what they are doing this is the stop!!!!  LGO has yet done it again!!!!
