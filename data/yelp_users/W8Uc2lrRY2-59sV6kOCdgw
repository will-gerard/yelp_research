The outside isn't impressive but it's pretty nice and clean inside. You get free chips and salsa which is a plus. Chips aren't good but the salsa makes up for it in a way. I tried the Pollo en Mole which is terrific! A little overpriced at $12 but those homemade corn tortillas are amazing. Big and fluffy. Overall it's a good hole in a wall. It is a sit down restaurant so bring that extra tip money. :)

I went here because it was cheap. But they put that big sign that says tips are appreciated which makes you feel guilty. Five dollars for an okay car wash and they dry your car which is nice. Soon after I left I went to the store and noticed that my car was covered in water marks. It looks dirty. All my windows need some windex and feel like I have wash my car again.

This is a cool little place. People were great, the interior is simple, and the beer was really good. I'm a stout man myself so I went for the Jomax Oatmeal Stout. Delicious and smooth! Their Black Caddis isn't too shabby either. It did get a little muggy with so many people in there but not a big deal for me at least. I initially went to go get some Loca Popa but I'm glad I grabbed a beer and socialized for a little while. I can definitely see myself heading back for a beer or two. :)
