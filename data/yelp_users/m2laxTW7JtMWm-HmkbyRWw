This place is absolutely horrible. I made a phone order for wings. They told me 30 minutes until it was ready.  Get there 30 minutes later and tell them I'm there to get my pick up order. The lady has me wait 10 minutes as she is filling orders, and then she says to me "sorry we are all out" next time! Are you freaking kidding me!? What type of business takes orders and has people drive to them. Makes them wait and then says they are out and to come back next time! Absolutely horrible! They don't even deserve 1 star!

I have been coming to Robert for over 10 years now. Robert and his barbers are the only people I trust with my haircuts. They never rush your haircut and take pride in the detailed haircuts. The staff is extremely friendly and make you feel like a part of the family. If your looking for a legit barber shop, then this is the place! Classy and top notch! Stan and Pinny are great people with tons of talent! Come give them a shot and you'll be glad you did!

This property is absolutely beautiful. The layout is unique and not found in any apartment complex. The maintenance team is amazing and the manager Albert is great! Always helpful, professional, and personable. Everyone at the office knows every tenant by name and they greet you the second they see you. They exceed in every aspect of customer service and really make you feel valued!

Went to this spa because of the great specials and I'm glad I did! Everyone is extremely friendly and the office was clean and relaxing. I went to Jordan and he is extremely good at what he does! I've gone to other spas before but this place can't be beat from the prices, their products, and services! All organic! If your looking for somewhere to pop in, this is your place!
