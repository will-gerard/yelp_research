Service:  Poor. I asked the gal what the Asian spicy chicken had in it. She didn't know so she asked another girl who didn't know either. The third girl they asked told me to look at the pictures on the wall. WTH? I gave up after that.  Food: Bland.  I had the teriyaki chicken dish. It consisted of a lot of overcooked dry chicken and 4-5 tiny pieces of broccoli.  Even the Sriracha sauce was bland?? Not sure how that can be either. The white rice was good.  At least I'm full.  Would I go back? Probably not.

Not the best location.  Had to ask if we should sit ourselves. No sign or anything explaining that.  Definitely a neighborhood dive.  Decor hadn't been updated since 1980.  Our waitress (the owner?) never smiled.  The other waitress could have covered up some.  Looked like she was going to a club. Try explaining that to your 10 year old son :-)   Kitchen was open so I got to watch one guy do all the work while muscular short dude stood around.   Lots of takeout while we were there.  Restaurant full of smoke when we walked in.  Son had a slice of cheese pizza.  The pizza slice was on the smallish side but he said it was good.  I ordered a calzone with meatballs and mushrooms.  Lots of mushrooms but not much meatball.  Almost nonexistent.  Tons of ricotta too.  Almost to the point of being too much. It was cheap but probably won't go back.

Brought my 2 boys for their first ever time on a golf course. We had a great time. The staff was very friendly. One guy offered to take our picture since it was their first time golfing. The course is perfect for the beginning golfer or to play with kids. Very affordable too. Kids were only $10 for 18 holes. Will play there again.

Have eaten here many times with my family.  Good food at reasonable prices.  Usually packed on the weekends.  Service is just ok. Parking is difficult on the weekends but we will return :-)

Always very friendly people at Coffee Rush.  Good prices and good coffee.  Only negative is that all the smokers hang out on the patio puffing their cancer sticks and blowing their smoke for all to breathe in.

Had sushi and Teppanyaki with my family.  The best sushi I had was the rock and roll sushi.  Very tasty.  Service was good.  Teppanyaki show was good.  Huge veggie portions and good variety of vegetables.  I really liked that.  We had steak, chicken, and shrimp plates.  All were enjoyed and I got the leftovers. Also tried the tempura plate.  Lots of food and nice crisp tempura.  Would go back again.

Not impressed. They screwed up order.  How hard can it be do make plain hamburger,  no cheese? I told the kid taking my order 3 times no cheese.  So when I get order and check it.  Cheese.  Guy goes to remake it and comes back real quick with new burger.  I burn my fingers on burger wrap....  Why you ask? Cause he microwaved the new burger.  Grrrrr.  When I asked him if he microwaved it he said no.  WTH? No way burger was cooked on grill that fast.  Pathetic service.

Had a scheduled morning appointment for some tree work.  Stayed home from work to wait for them.  They never showed up or called.  After 2 hours of waiting, I finally called the office to find out if they were coming.  Lady in office was nice and everything but she informed me that they couldn't make it to my scheduled appointment.  I don't understand that at all.  I had a scheduled appointment and they couldn't make it? I went with another company who actually showed up when they said they would.

Excellent work.  He took the time to explain my repair and gave me several options on the fix.  Price was reasonable and was completed ahead of schedule.  Would definitely use again for future furniture repairs.

Sunday afternoon and they have one guy working in the copy/print center with 4 people in line waiting for service.  2 cashiers standing around doing nothing.  Don't they cross train their employees?

My wife works nearby and they go here for lunch a lot.  She tells me at lunch time they are usually packed.   I always get her leftover sandwich which I found quite tasty. Tonight we were in the neighborhood and decided to stop by.  I finally got a hot, fresh cheese steak from them instead of leftovers! Awesome sandwich.  They have a 12 or 8 inch.  I got the 8 inch sandwich and was stuffed.  Very good cheese steak.  One of the best that I have ever had.  Mine had grilled onions and mushrooms.  The people running the place are so nice and welcoming.  Can't wait to return.

Terrible customer service.  Wanted to buy some American Express gift cards to use for our vacation.  I was going to pay using my Frys gift card. Amount was around 2k. First, the lady at customer service had attitude on why would I want to buy so much.  Huh? None of your business lady.  Then she called the manager Travis over to approve.  She apparently wasn't listening to me on what I wanted.  He said it was possible. I told him that he would need to be there for an override at the cashier since the amount was large.  I got the6cards and went to tbe6 cashier.  She said again not possible to pay with my Frys card.  Huh? I told her she needed a manager override for large amounts.  Not sure where Travis went. It took me 30 seconds to pick the cards out. He knew he had to override but just decided to abandon me. I gave up at this point and went to another Frys where they were professional and knew how to do their jobs.

Been coming here since they opened.  Great restaurant run by great family.  Always packed. Very kid friendly.  I have never had a bad meal here. My favorite pizza is the grandma pizza. Just like my mom made in Italy.

The best pizza. Grandma's pizza is the best.  Perfect as usual.  Place was even more packed than usual on a Friday night.  Sal's Gilbert Pizza was featured on the Food Network Diners, Drive ins, and Dives and everyone was here eating and watching it.  So awesome for Gilbert Pizza.

Awesome gelato.  Best in the East Valley.  The grocery part of the store has Italian items that cannot be found anywhere else.  Great deli too.  We sampled the gnocchi tonight.  My boys loved them.  Highly recommend this place for Italian food and gelato.

Went with friends.  Inside was very nice.  Not too loud.  Only complaint I had on the ambiance was the lighting.  I had to use my cell phone flash light app to read the menu.  We had 2 waiters.  Very knowledgeable on the steaks.  One was a bit pushy but not too bad.  Our party of 10 had mostly steaks.  My family really liked their steaks.  All were cooked as ordered and were tasty (I sampled my wife's steak) . I ordered the pork chop.  Very tasty but slightly overcooked.  A few had some starter salads.  Nothing fancy there and not worth the cost (IMO).  We also sampled many of the side dishes.  The lobster mashed potatoes were very good as were the scalloped potatoes.  The green beans could have had more slivered almonds.  The asparagus were the least liked side dish.  Not much flavor.  Most of us had water to drink.  A few of the kids had soda.  They serve the soda in small bottles so each refill ups the $$. Seems a bit tacky that they nickel and dime people on soda.  We sampled 2 of the deserts.  One was a sugar cake.  I really liked it.  The other was a huge piece of chocolate cake.  We all agreed that the chocolate cake was too dry.  Coffee was good.  Nice espresso cup.  All in all, it was a pleasant evening spent with good friends.

Went Saturday, September 13th around lunch time.  Walked in with family and sat.  Restaurant part was empty.  We were the only patrons.  Bar had a few people watching football.  Sat for 10 minutes.  Nobody came over to our table.  I watched the bar tender lady instead talk to another girl.  We left.  Will not be back.

Went here for some cell phone accessories today.  All of the staff was very helpful and answered all of our questions.  The T-mobile representative that helped us specifically was Carlos.  I am very impressed with Carlos and how he interacted with us. He was able to answer every question and gave us many options to choose from.  Would definitely recommend Carlos and this T-mobile store.

I really wanted to like this place but the food just wasn't that good.  I guess I don't see why everyone thinks this place is good for Italian.  We have been there twice now and both times were the same.   Let's start with service.  This was the high point of the night.  Our waiter was very nice and attentive.   Now the food.  We started with a fried zucchini appetizer.  The zucchini was nicely done.  Crisp outside and dusted with cheese.  I did like this dish.   The salad sounded promising.  Greens, olives, cheese, onions, and sliced Genoa salami with a balsamic dressing.  Sounded good but it had no taste whatsoever.  They must have waved the vinegar over the dish and called it good.  The salad just had no taste.  Almost felt like I was eating mayo.   I ordered the baked rigatoni with sausage.  The menu  described it as being served with a garlic spiked red sauce.  This sounded good and our waiter said that it was a marinara sauce.  No creme.  There was nothing garlicky about the sauce.  I think they actually added butter to the dish.  Not even close to a red sauve and it was just blah. No taste again.  How can you advertise garlic spiked and have it taste like butter??  My wife ordered the pizza with some pasta on top of it with meatballs.  It was ok.  The meatballs had some taste to them (mostly salt) . The crust was nice.   I grew up speaking Italian and eating Italian food.  This ain't it ; not even close.  I am trying to figure out what people see in the food.  To each their own I guess.  Return factor is 10%

Walked in around 730 pm on a Wednesday night.  Almost thought I stepped into a library.  Every person in the place had laptops open and was studying.  Kind of wierd.  Anyways, library or not, this place can make an espresso! Very good and served in a ceramic cup. Will definitely be back.  Maybe I will bring something to study

Went with a large group from work. Excellent food. Low cost. I think everyone enjoyed their food. Only complaint I would have was that the carrot and jalapeno mix at the condiment bar was not very spicy at all. Would go back for lunch again.

Had some tiles get blown off of my roof during the last monsoon.  I had gotten an estimate from another company who said they would be back the next day to fix it. They never showed up or called.  On my way home I called Vazkez Roofing.  Debbie told me that Daniel could come by that night to give me an estimate.  His price was very reasonable.  He told me that they could be at my house the next day.  They showed up on time and even fixed a few other tiles at no extra cost.  They were in and out in about an hour and cleaned up after themselves.  Excellent service and I would definitely hire them for any future roofing work.

Update to my previous review.  I hired Agave a second time.  I needed them to remove a tree that was damaged by the monsoon and to trim another tree. They showed up on time, did an excellent job, and were good about cleaning up after themselves.  They will be my go to tree service company in the future.

Very good breakfast place we found after a soccer match up north.  Went on Sunday morning.  15 minute wait and it was packed inside.  I had the chicken tamale green chile breakfast plate (special of the day) . I really enjoyed my meal.  Very flavorful.  My wife had something called the big messy breakfast scramble.  Eggs, bacon, mushrooms, onions, and potatoes all scrambled up with a side of toast.  Her serving was HUGE! I took a few bites and really liked it.  She couldn't finish the meal.  The good news is that will be my breakfast the next day :) . My one son had the pancakes breakfast.  2 big pancakes with 2 eggs.  I tried his pancakes and they were really good.  The pancakes had lemon zest added which I have never had before but they were very tasty.  My son could barely finish the meal since it was a lot of food.  My other son had the kids chicken nuggets.  The nuggets were very good.  They were homemade chicken nuggets.  I tried those also and they were definitely yummy.  The staff was very friendly.  Return factor is 100%  Only negative would be that it was a bit hot inside.  Either the air conditioning wasn't working properly or they had the temperature set too high.

We went last Sunday night.  Very friendly staff.  I had the smoked turkey.  Lots of meat and it was very tasty.  My wife got the smoked chicken.  It pretty much tasted like smoke.  Not much flavor and she did not like it.  My son had the pulled pork sandwich which he really liked.  My other son had a full slab of ribs which we all sampled. Good taste to the ribs.  Coleslaw side was good.  Fries were limp and slightly greasy.  Desert was fried oreo cookies.  I didn't try them but my son liked them.  Dinner for 4 of us came to about $80 before tip.  Return factor is 75%

Awesome burgers and fries! Their fries actually taste like potatoes. Three of us went there today.  I had the green chile burger.  If you like green chile, this is the burger for you.  There is a list of about 10 different things you can also add to your burger (olives, lettuce, tomato, onions, etc....) . Burgers are huge and lots of fries.  The onions rings are crispy.  We left stuffed.  About $30 for 3 people.  Not bad considering the quality of the food.  Staff is friendly also.  Only negative is that they use Hunts ketchup.  Return factor is 100%

Went on Saturday afternoon for late lunch.  The place was packed even this early.  Got seated in the bar at the taller tables which weren't too comfortable.  Oh well.  Waitress was very friendly.  We started with the fried zucchini appetizer.  Came out quickly.  Taste was so-so.  Batter kept falling off the vegetable and the zucchini were very mushy.  Did not care for this dish at all. Three of us ordered burgers and one had the chicken sandwich.  My burger was good.  Not great but good.  Seemed to be lacking seasoning.  The other two people said the same about their burgers.  The fourth in our party had the chicken sandwich and it was awesome.  Wow.  Very good.  I will order this next time.  Three of us had shakes and they were tasty.  Our bill for 4 people was around $120 with tip. A bit pricey but we splurged.  Return factor :75%

Stopped by on recent trip to this area.  Very nice location and interior.  Two of us ordered burgers and fries.  Burgers were massive half pound monsters.  Very good taste and cooked properly.  Both of us really liked the fries.  Another person ordered the chicken sandwich with ham.  Same idea as the burgers.  Massive size.  She could only finish half of the sandwich and really liked it.  The last person in our party has the surf and turf. Chicken strips and some fried shrimp.  He really liked his meal.  Overall, we all enjoyed our lunch and return factor is 100 %
