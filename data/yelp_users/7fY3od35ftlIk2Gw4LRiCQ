I order take out from here fairly regularly, they're always prompt and delicious. The coconut curry and the pad see ewe are awesome. I'm not sure if they have lunch specials so it can be a bit more expensive for a quick lunch but the quality is evident and totally worth the extra two or three dollars you spend instead of going somewhere not nearly as good. You can tell their meats are quality and not just hidden under a load of spices. Highly recommended.

Every time I come in here, the staff is always so friendly and helpful. It's very clean and well maintained, and I can see that they work very hard to keep a good pace.   The berry upbeet is okay, but the Orange carrot karma is my Shit. Acai bowls are also pretty good. I will always wish it was a little cheaper, and I feel like there's a lot of sugar in their smoothies.

The only unpleasant experience I've had here was that one time I got roofied, but overall I'm not mad at the bar for that. Thats what happens when you take drinks from strangers (take notes, kids) and it's not the bars fault that happened. The staff is always awesome and they're good at remembering people and making you feel welcome. Drinks are also well priced and you can't beat their pool tables and juke box.

I love this place. My hands hurt every time I leave but I'm not even mad, the staff are very helpful and knowledgeable, my only complaint would be some of the paths seem inconsistently ranked. I'll nail a 5.11 and then feel stuck on a 5.8. At first I thought it was just my arms being tired but others in my group had the same issue. Even still it's a guaranteed good time.

The employees are all very nice and you can't really beat the prices. The slices are generously sized and absolutely delicious. I recommend the cannoli as well but you'll probably want to split it with someone, as it's super heavy, being a cannoli and all.

I love this place, they have the best patio and their staff is almost always super friendly. Some of their staff aren't always the most pleasant, but they get the drinks out quick and that's what counts for me here. Their patio is dog friendly before five and I think they're cool with dogs staying there as well if you end up hanging out after five. Prices are affordable but the atmosphere and the patio are the real reasons to go here.  In other news, I've gotten out of bed at like 11 pm to go get cheese sticks to go from here because I just crave them sometimes.

Just stopped in for lunch and it was so delicious. I had the shawarma pita sandwich and my roommate had a kifta pita sandwich and both were delicious. Followed it up with some of their homemade baklava and we were set. The owner is so friendly and pleasant, his greatness is matched only by the food. They also have a lot of market style goods, snacks and refrigerated foods for people looking to take more home. Absolutely thrilled with this place and can't wait to come back!

Came here to get new insoles (inSouls for those in the know) and new running shoes. I'm normally a cheap bastard but it's worth it to come in and get them and quality running shoes that will fit your needs.  I was helped by Naithan Scott who was very knowledgeable and went above and beyond to help us. Hurry there so he can help you before he becomes an Olympian! Wonderful, wonderful service.

Came here for dinner with my parents after we worked out, so we were starving. Monique was our server and she was spectacular and attentive. The entire staff was effective together it seemed as several people came by to help bag our to go boxes etc. Noreena also came by and chatted with us for a bit and she was also absolutely wonderful. It seems like they have a great team here and it really boosted our experience from being just a quick dinner since we couldn't get together for Mother's Day yesterday to a really enjoyable and memorable experience. Food was great, waters were regularly refilled. Absolutely no complaints, keep on rocking!

I came here today with my mom and step dad since I had to work for father's day yesterday, and I can safely say I won't be coming back. I try not to give such negatively focused reviews but it was a pretty unpleasant experience. The place looks cute and it's owned locally which I absolutely support, but I would need to hear about some major changes before returning.  Our server was Stacy, and she was pleasant and joked along with us at first, but did not once refill our waters, which were emptied fairly quickly. My parents both drink decaf coffee, and when we hadn't seen our server in a while, my step dad asked another girl passing by if they could have a refill on the decaf coffee she said "Yeah." and sounded pissed off about it. I mean, I don't expect her to bow and tell us she lives to serve or something, but it shouldn't be the greatest inconvenience in the world to fill a coffee cup. When our server returned to fill their coffees, it was caffeinated.  I ordered the Greek omelet which arrived about 20 minutes later, undercooked with potatoes which I asked not to be included. My mom ordered two eggs over medium and toast, and one came back almost over hard and the other was cooked all the way through. My step dad got smothered potatoes, which he said were okay.  Stacy was nice, but inattentive and slow, and I hate giving a bad review because I'm a server as well, but it should have been simple, nothing was complicated about our orders, and it was overall a huge disappointment.  This was my first time coming in, but my step dad and mom have been in twice before and both times spoke with the owner because they had problems with their experience (hour long wait, wrong food, water not being refilled, etc.) and hoped something had changed. I guess the third times the charm because they both will not be returning either.
