I highly totally recommend this place. The doc, a tall short hair gentleman, was professional and courteous. You could tell this was not his first rodeo, he knew what he was doing. The staff was nice and was able to get me in within a few days. I was in and out in less than 45 minutes. The Dr I saw told me "if you were my brother, I'd tell you that you don't need glasses, don't waste your money!" I was shocked. I was told 10 years ago that I do need glasses and had purchased a pair. This guy could have totally lied to me and taken my money, my insurance would have even paid for it, and he didn't! Hard to find honest people these days. I'll definitely be back if I ever need anything with my eyes again.  I couldn't be happier with this place. It's easy for a Dr in this field to make their money off people, telling them they "need" glasses etc. I don't know anything about eyes or prescription glasses.

Love Papa Johns Pizza but kinda sucks when the delivery time is over an hour and half. But it's cool, I'll just go pick up the pizza, right?? NOPE! Can't pick up the pizza, delivery only... It's 10:40pm by the way. Ridiculous. Dominoes it is! Not cool Papa. Lost my business.

The artichoke dip is amazing! Our appetizer and entree came out at the same time though, not cool, But overall, one of my downtown favs.

GREAT staff...David was very accommodating. Friendly and extremely helpful. Showed us how to work all the equipment, checked on us several times to see if we needed anything, even opened a brand new brush out of the package because ours was slightly broken. Very satisfied, we'll definitely be back.

RUN FAR FAR AWAY! TERRIBLE!  If I could give negative stars, I would. I ordered a pizza, the BOY answers the phone in a hurry, didn't ask how I was going to pay, didn't take my credit card info, didn't verify my phone number, told me it would be 15-20 minutes, I asked if he needed further directions for the driver b/c its in an apt- he said no, AND told me it would be $15.90-something. The delivery driver ended up getting lost b/c the guy had the wrong address, 42 minutes later the driver arrives after I gave him directions, he expected cash which I did not have. I wanted to pay with my card. The driver left the pizza with me and goes back to the store. The "manager" calls and wants payment; I have no problem with that, BUT when I told him what all happened, he TOTALLY froze stuttered his words and was completely USELESS! Its absolutely pathetic that this KID is a manager. Its like Fisher Price opened a pizza shop and hired him. He has NO idea how to talk to someone.  OH! and he gave me the wrong # to corporate... coincidence? --- and my pizza was cold. ugh.  Harold, the delivery guy, was super awesome guy. He owned up to the mistake, apologized, offered excellent customer service even though it wasn't his mistake. Nice job Harold!  Now waiting on a call back from corporate and the district manager.  Dear Donavan, Your management skills, or lack they're of, are some of the worst I've ever experienced. I would almost rather pay your college tuition than for you to ever handle an adult situation again. Don't ever EVER lie to a customer. You will always get caught... sorry had to call your corporate on ya. Shouldn't have done that, sir. CHEERS.

Not impressed at all. Had the coconut soup and phad Thai. It tasted like it was one of the "instant" bowls. I've had Thai several times in my life, I've even purchased some of the Thai instant stuff for my home. The taste was ridiculously similar. It wasn't a good experience at all. I won't be back, unfortunately. I was really excited about this place seeing all the reviews.

Very high pressured sales. Did not enjoy my experience here. I've been drinking tea for years and have never been pressured into buying so much. I had to tell the guy "no" 6 times! I came in to sample a few and maybe spend $20... I go to checkout with a $49 tab! I should have just said no but to avoid a scene I just paid it, ugh! Walked out and got really pissed thinking back on it. Won't be back for sure! Frustrating... This tea better be good!

Dr. Mundt ROCKS! Super sweet and she's an ND, which I'm a little partial to those Docs anyways. The consult took about 20 minutes, she was very thorough, answered all my crazy questions and really took the time to listen to my concerns. She's very confident in her practice, which really eased my mind especially since she's the one that will be lazering my skin off!  They offered alot of payment options and incentives, it really helped out with my budget. I pay $75 a month for the next 13 treatments to remove my tattoo. They also do lots of other services that I haven't taken advantage of yet. I did get a B12 shot and I think I'm going to try the acupuncture and microdermabrasion as well. They gave me 2 free shirts and knocked off 10% for my partner's military discount! WIN WIN. Going back for my 2nd treatment in a few days. I'll update ya again after.  and the decor of the place is really awesome... I was happy with the services.
