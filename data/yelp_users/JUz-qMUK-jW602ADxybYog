TJ has installed remote starters on 3 of my vehicles.  He is definitely my go-to guy for any car electronics installations.   His prices are competitive, but more importantly, his service is fantastic!  He is always finished on time and his attention to detail delivers very clean and reliable results.   Highly recommended!

Great sushi!  Get the new Zealand king salmon whenever it is on special.  Chefs will also wow you with custom creations.

They do not stand behind their products.    Bought a helicopter that broke in the first week. Took it back for an exchange within the 30 policy on the receipt.  However they would not replace it.  They didn't even offer a repair or discount on another one.   I would recommend to buy elsewhere.

We have used True Health Medical for several years.  I give them my highest recommendation.    I used to have terrible allergies (especially cats and pollen). During spring and fall I would survive on Zyrtec and Allegra.   I met with true health about bioveda treatment and was very skeptical at first. Since the treatment I have been allergy free for several years and have not taken any allergy medication since!   They also did treatment on my chronic stiff/sore shoulder.  About 3 months later I had full motion and zero pain.    I like their approach to health care. Never push prescriptions or surgery unless an absolute last resort.  They really do their research on how our bodies heal and how to reduce inflammation through a holistic approach that blends traditional and modern medicine.

My expectations were very high due to all they hype around this Phoenix Area soul food legend.  I got the #3 Lo-Lo and was not impressed. Quality was not there for the price.  The chicken was greasy and my stomach told me never to eat that again... Ugh! I can make better waffles at home.  Sad :-(  Service was good, so I gave it 2-stars instead of 1
