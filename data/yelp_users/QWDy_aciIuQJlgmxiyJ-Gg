I like this in comparison to PF Changs.  Each dish is $5-$7 bucks cheaper and its set up like a take out or eat in.  Fast service and really good food.   Some of our favs are the Vietnamese chicken salad which is like an egg roll in rice paper.  If you have never tried them check it out.  Also love the Chicken Pad Thai and pretty much everything else they have for that matter.

Everyone was very pleasant today.  I love shopping here they really take care of you.  I broke my bottle of of Chanel Coco Mademoiselle and they actually replaced it for me.  Amazing!  I started a page on facebook about it https://www.facebook.com/BestChanelPerfume "Like" us!

This place was pretty disgusting, dirty, over priced, bad service, bad food yuck.  Got the two taco plate one ground beef and one chicken with beans and rice.  I dont know how they screwed up that ground beef to taste like it wasnt beef.  At least the chicken tasted like chicken but bland and nothing special.  Beans tasteless and of course rice same thing.  Looks like a family run business and nobody cares.  They are hiding in the back most of the time.  Friend walked up to get someones attention but crickets so I actually whistled really loud so my friend could get a beer to wash away the bad taste.  Will definitely never return.

They now have a police tower in the parking lot because the auto theft is so bad which wont keep me from coming back because I have full coverage but it is a worry every single time still.   I hope they can clean this place up.

Love this place.  Its not the best for atmosphere but its the best for food.  I came from the San Francisco Bay Area and can really appreciate Chinese food.  My favs here are the pot stickers, curry chicken which isnt on the menu but they will make it for you if you ask and Kung Pao anything.  Almost forgot the egg foo yung they make it just like they do in San Fran just awesome.  They use all white meat in all their chicken dishes which I love.  I dont even have to ask and they dont upcharge me to get it.

So I was a fan for many years, moved away, came back to area ordered and it was good.  Ordered again and wow it was not good for first time ever.  I called to let them know and I got the cook or so he said.  He said he worked there for 17+ years and nothing really changed but I said no mushrooms and they put canned mushrooms in which was not that big a deal cuz I just picked them all out but the chicken was completely overcooked and tough to chew.  The pot stickers were burnt but not slightly more like all over it had a weird brown color and then burnt on one side.  Tasted a little off too.  I thought they always made these by hand.  I think they still do but I dont know what the heck happened on this night.  Had egg foo young and that was dripping with oil.  The whole thing was a mess.  My husband and I both said if that were our first visit we would never be back.

What happened to you guys?  I used to love your food.  I tried something different this time just to see if that was bad too and guess what?  Yep it was not good.  Waited more than an hour for delivery which is no big deal just letting you know.  Got the pong pong special chicken it was overcooked and chewy but I was hungry so I ate it however I did not put the left overs in the fridge.  No I just threw it out right away cuz I knew where it was eventually going anyway.  Why prolong it right?  Got pot stickers like I usually do and this time they werent a weird color and totally burnt while tasting a little funny no, this time they were really thick with dough.  So thick the dough was hard on the ends cuz it hadnt cooked through all the way and inside was very bland meat which was devoid of spices.

This store has a larger selection than most here in the Valley and they are much better about organizing their merchandise.  For instance if I visit a smaller Marshalls I am looking all over the place for shower soap.  They dont have a specific area for it so it could be on one of 5 or 6 displays and there is no rhyme or reason to the display.  At this store all the soap for the shower is in one place saving me a ton of time.  The only problem here is that you have to watch out for your car in the parking lot it can easily be stolen.

Prices were out of this world high.  We walked in looked at pricing on just a couple items that we have been looking at and their price was so high and so out of line we both just turned right around and walked out.  I dont mind paying more for something to have it now but they take their  high prices to another level.  Just not that impressed with them.

Spent our anniversary weekend in Vegas with another couple.  Husbands uncle is a local he says you gotta go to the Golden Steer forget about Gordon Ramseys place.  He says you get the same thing for $65 a person so we all gave it a try.    The atmosphere reminds me of an old time piano wine bar from the 70's/80's but a little run down in need of some updating.  Waiter was weird and had an attitude that kept growing throughout the night.  He told us how hed been there quite a long time but had left for a while and come back etc making a point I guess that most of them were there for 20+ years.    We got a bottle of wine and then ordered.  I had the filet which was nicely cooked and the twice cooked potato.  The potato was actually about the worst i have ever had because it was obvious that it had sat in the oven either all day or for hours.  It was completely burnt on the bottom but not in a good way.  You know how you can totally overdo a potato skin to complete crispy browness that its cracking apart but it still tastes good?  Ya well not like that this was BURNT.  Could not cut it with a fork burnt.  Had to use a steak knife to get through it sooo cuz our waiter was weird with attitude I wasnt going to say anything about my $10 potato.    The waiter came back at least 5 times aggressively asking if we wanted another bottle of wine.  It started to feel like it was a demand rather than a request which we all noticed.  At the end we all got dinner drinks/coffee and dessert.  The drinks came out right away and we had a nice conversation while we waited for dessert.  The restaurant only had 3 tables and I noticed 2 waiters and a couple bussers as well as the guy doing the salads and desserts so when we finished the drinks we asked where dessert was.  We were hoping to have it with the drinks but  its like 30 minutes or more later and the waiters response was really snotty that they only had one of those dessert trays and the guy was going to get to us.  We were there at 7 pm and the only people on dessert at the time.    We didnt understand the really negative reaction we were getting so we were doing our best to be respectful responding with yes sir etc.  Its almost as if he mistook our kindness for weakness which seems to be happening a whole lot these days when you go out.  So I watched the dessert guy make our dessert and I noticed he was making cherries jubilee instead of the bananas foster we ordered so I said something about it in a very nice way LOL that doesnt seem to matter.  The response was almost like are you effing kidding me?  This bitch makes a mistake I gotta fix?  He didnt say that but his body language sure did.  The dessert guy went away the waiter comes back with more attitude and do you want another bottle of wine again.  He seemed pissed at us that the guy was making cherries and that we didnt want that as well.    They finally made it right and I tasted one bite and not good.  We make it better at home.  Everyone at table agreed we make it better so good thing I got the tiramisu because that was pretty good.  This is the important part.  I would never have bothered writing any of this until this part happened!  The waiter brings the bill and most of the time my husband just takes care of it but this time I had a funny feeling about the waiter so I looked at it and thank the lord I did because that dude double charged us and charged us extra for stuff that already came with etc. For instance my husband ordered asparagus with Hollandaise sauce $11.  The waiter charged us for 2 of those $22 + Hollandaise sauce $5x 2 = $10 so his asparagus was $32.  When we pointed out the errors to the waiter he seemed intensely aggravated.  He responded very quickly like he was expecting it.  I bet he was.  I bet they do that all night long.  He said oh when they put it in they must have made a mistake like someone else rang his order in and like it happens and he will have to go straighten "them" out.  Bill came back minus $150 but I am positive we still paid too much because that extra sauce crap didnt hit me til we got home that the asparagus already had Hollandaise on it and I just looked it up on the menu to be sure and yep sure enough.    Bottom line:  These people can cook a steak but so can the Keg and Firebirds etc  DO NOT TRUST YOUR WAITER:  Go over your bill  -  They are looking for suckers  Fair restaurant prices on bottles of wine  NONE of us would ever return

We have wanted to try this place for quite sometime but its usually so busy that we dont dare try to find a parking space.  Today didnt look so bad unfortunately :-)  Wish we had tried the Daily Dose instead.  Oh well theres always next time.  These reviews are hilarious.  Made the mistake of not reading them before hand.  The service sucked.  The waitress sucked.  She really pissed me off.  My husband had to keep reminding me the girl was young and what if that was your daughter cuz I wanted to punch her in the face.  It took forever just to be acknowledged, waited a lifetime for some water.  Asked her what was good on menu this is our first visit.  Too bad we took her advice.  My husband got the bird omelet which I tasted and YUCK.  It was completely bland.  He had to pour hot sauce all over it for flavor.  They put the eggs right on top of the fresh cold fruit so that now you cant eat it or wouldnt want to eat it.  If they just read their own reviews they would stop doing that.  Talk about dumb asses.  I got the huevos rancheros with green chili.  It comes in an open chipotle tortilla that is MINUS any taste.  Its swimming in juices which is making the tasteless tortilla into glue.  Comes with two eggs on top.  The flavors together were just not that good.  Got a $4 glass of fresh squeezed orange juice that made my face scrunch up because of the bitterness.  Waitress brought bill way too early obviously trying to get rid of us but that just pisses me off even further cuz thats her ticket to not having to do shit.  I waived that bitch down anyway.  I want water bitch.  The only reason they get 2 whole stars is because the green chili was good otherwise hate this place :-)

Had plans to go to breakfast at RNR but they were closed at 10:30 am so we Yelped it and found Orange Table at the top of the Yelp list with lots of good reviews.    This place is pretty hard to find.  Had to stop and ask 3 people, make 1 phone call to restaurant, and husband running all over trying to find.  Finally found it unfortunately!  Its a cute little place.  We had hoped the food was going to be as good as the reviews say it is but no not really.    My husband had banana pancakes with side of bacon.  Pancakes were honestly no joke the worst I have ever had.  I literally spit it out in my napkin.  Husband said it wasnt that bad but he wouldnt have it again.  I had a mushroom omelet with a cream sherry sauce.  It really was not that good to me.  That sauce would have been great on a piece of steak but it was just a weird pairing in an omelet to me and the taste I just couldnt get past.  One bite and I forced myself to try another bite just to be sure and ya I was sure yuck no good I pushed it away.    Unfortunately my waitress was busy in deep conversation with the table next to us so she didnt know there was a problem until my husband was completely done.  She offered to have something else made but 1/3 of the breakfast menu was corned beef which I am not that fond of and nothing else sounded that great so I declined.    She brought the bill back and gave us half off the meal I couldnt eat because it tasted awful so for that, my husbands 2 pancakes and bacon along with a mocha the bill was $35.  That kinda pissed me off so I asked her if she could please do something about it because I literally ate a bite and it just wasnt good.  It was so much not good that I just wanted out of there.  She said I dont know I will have to ask the owner so I said ok and then she walked over to the cash register took it off without asking anyone and then drop it off again.    So 2 lousy pancakes, 2 pieces of bacon, and 1 coffee $20 with a $3 tip.  Asked the hub would you go back he said NO.  I of course would never go back.  Oh well better luck next time.    Check out the unfiltered reviews.  Lots of bad reviews there.  They seem to have had the same experience I had.  They have to be paying people to review them positively.

This was not a very good experience for me, my husband, or my daughter.  Made a visit to the Scottsdale mall store and an incredibly rude younger dark haired woman helped us.    I guess she wasn't happy that we were asking the prices.  Maybe she felt our $500 purchase was a waste of her precious bitch time, not sure.  I came over to the counter to help my daughter pick something that she really wanted and not to go for the cheaper closure because she was probably worried she was taking advantage of us.  I was pointing her to something of more quality and of course more expensive because I would prefer she gets something nice that will last a very long time and that she would be happy with.  The bitch actually told me to go take a seat in the man chair because they were close to a decision.  I actually made that bitch more money but I think she may have been too stupid and too impatient to even realize nor do I think she cares about our piddly little purchase.  Normally I would educate a dumb bitch like that but I just didnt need the drama so I walked away.   When I first walked into that store nobody knew that I was there with anyone else because I went in a couple minutes after my husband and my daughter.  I was looking in a completely different area and I was actively IGNORED.  The store was not busy.  There was a woman helping a customer at the counter where I was browsing.  After the customers purchase was completed the sales associate did not acknowledge me nor did she look me in the eye.  She walked over to another counter and started to do some type of paper work.  She never looked back in my direction.  I find that very odd.    Dont go to the store in person unless you want them to shit on you instead purchase online.  Better service!  Love the product hated the service.    I almost forgot the only pleasant thing about the visit was the very nice security man at the door that greeted everyone with a very nice welcoming smile and a hello.  This is the guy that needs to replace the dumb bitches that work there :-)  If I were the manager here heads would roll and I would turn this place around.  None of those bitches would work for me.

I have always really liked this little dark and dingy hole in the wall for the beer only.  Their food is not good.  There isnt anything good on the menu other than beer dont even bother with it cuz over the years my husband and I have tried about 5 different things and they all consistently sucked however, the beer made up for it.  Its not like a typical brewery like lets say a Gordon Biersch where they have a few they make all year round and then 1 seasonal beer.  Papago specializes in beer.   Local beer, micro breweries, from other countries, states etc. If you have never been here it is definitely something to experience.  Papago is only getting a 2 star from me because the food sucks now and always has but also because we had the worst service there ever today.  We walked in and it was a bit busier than it usually is during the afternoon.  There were no seats at the bar so we sat at a table close by and tried to be patient but the servers were actively ignoring us and other customers were going to the bar since they were unable to get service.  After about 10 minutes of waiting I said excuse me to the waitress that walked by.  She definitely heard me and she didnt care so I went to the bar and asked the man if there was anyone to take care of the tables he said sure be there in a minute.  I asked if I could get a coconut joe and if I could sample 1 of the other coffee beers so I could figure out which of the 2 coffee beers I would take home with me and I told him that.  He said sure no prob.  My husband asked for a sample of something and another beer.  This guy brought me a tiny little sliver of a sample.  It was maybe 2 tablespoons.  The other samples he brought were a little bigger around 4 tablespoons.  He misunderstood my husband and rather than bringing him a sample of the one he asked for the guy brought him a full beer so my husband tastes it doesnt like it but based on the servers really crappy attitude there was no way my husband was going to say anything.  So the guy asks me if I liked the sample and I asked him for a full beer of it and said I couldnt really tell because there wasnt much in that glass. He got a bit pissy you could tell.  He must not have realized I asked for a full beer because he went and got me another sample and I said oh thank you that was nice.  Trying to lighten his mood which it did seem to do for a second then he said oh I brought you the wrong one that was what my husband was drinking the one he didnt like.  I am guessing he did it on purpose and then re thought it when I was nice to him.  Anyway long story way longer when I got the bill he charged 1.84 each for these tiny little samples that we got one that was not even a sample it was more like sweat on the glass.  I wasnt havin that crap.  I am not a newb.  I have been here before dude.  I asked him whats this?  He said oh well we are supposed to charge for the sample I am just doing what I was trained to do.  I said wow ok I never knew you charged for samples I have come for years this is the first time someone charged for a sample.  He says well I dont normally do that when people buy a beer but you said that one sample was too small.  I said wow I could see it all over your face how pissed off and aggravated you were that we wanted to sample but honestly we didnt ask for much only 2 a piece and we did buy a beer we bought several and brought two growlers in to fill to bring home.  We had a $55 bill.  Is this guy insane?  I normally dont do that if you buy a beer?  Am I in the twitlight zone.  Yes I said TWITLIGHT.  What a freakin TWIT.  So the idiot twit said I am done with you.  Can you believe this ass said I am done with you?   To my face none the less.  When I told him I could read his body language about how pissed off he was that was when he said I am done with you.  Little Effer.  I am done with you dude and done with that little hole in the wall and the bad treatment.  This little effer twit almost had a $10 or more tip but instead we left there with a bad taste in our mouth, he got a $1 tip and Papago gets this crappy review.

Haven't been here in a while and service not good tonight.  Husband had to go in to flag someone down for water after a long wait, an abnormally long wait on the patio.  It wasnt even busy so after the waitress made initial visit to our table she didnt come back to check on us for a really long time so food was going cold.  finally she came when I was 3/4 of the way finished but I tried to eat slower than the slow I already eat so that I could get the green salsa that I love.  After a really long wait maybe 15 minutes and honestly I think it was more like 20 she comes back with hot enchilada sauce.  I was so upset now because the whole meal was just crap cold and soggy since we had to wait so long in between each visit.  Finally she comes back and I tell her she brought wrong sauce and that I would like the green salsa please.  Again after a really long wait she finally brings the right thing.  Anyway it was yuck and it was cold, and soggy and not fun sorry I already said that.  I used to go here all the time but the visit prior to this one almost the same thing happened.  I had a cold wet soggy burrito by the time I got my salsa.  That was in May and i used to go at least once a week.  So since that last awful visit in May 7 months later I try again and wow it was the same and worse.  Bummer, used to love this place.

I heard from some friends that this place was awesome and that it was much better than Pita Jungle.  If its better than Pita I am all over it.  My husband and I went and we got the two most popular things on their menu plus an iced tea.  The flavors were very nice but I didnt like the use of dark chicken meat.  To me it just doesnt taste as good and there was no choice it just comes that way.  Other things were really dry and not as good as what I am used to when I go out to eat.  The iced tea was nice it was a black tea with cinnamon added so not that special but I guess it is different than the norm which I like.  To me Pita Jungle and My Big Fat Greek are far superior but of course it would depend on what you ordered.  I like spicy and I love tahini.  This place was kinda below average for me and I think its because of the dark meat chicken.  My husband left his whole plate untouched pretty much.  He had a sampler with grape leaves, meat balls, rice, etc.  it wasnt that good but we brought it home and I warmed it up the next day and it was much better for some reason.

I thought they had really turned things around for a while there.  I have ordered a few salads to go and only been in a handful of times since the reopen.  Quality of food and service had gone up however my recent experience was back to the usual lower quality presentation and the same low quality service that I had become accustomed to prior to the fire. On our most recent visit My husband and I came in with friends and I didnt want to bring attention to the really bad attitude the server had but when we got home my husband said something about how rude and weird our server was.  We definitely noticed the same thing so I am sure my friends did as well.  That alone is enough to not want to make another visit.  My salad was not at all what I would usually expect.  I took a picture of the sad little salad.  This one was definitely the worst they have ever made for me.  I got a picture of it just to remind myself not to bother coming back again.  My server had such a crappy attitude that I didnt even want to say anything about the salad.  Not sure what his problem was.  The restaurant seemed pretty empty and we made 0 complaints and still got treated like crap.

This store is not set up very well.  It doesnt seem well organized or labeled.  You have to jump around to different areas to find something that should have been somewhere else.  There is a very long wait for help actually just for the first hint of an acknowledgement when you are waiting upstairs to speak to someone.  The line waiting stands around wondering if they should be waiting for the one guy behind the counter that has been helping the same people for the last 10 minutes or if we should go get someone or maybe we dont get help maybe we have to search through their sea of disorganization all by ourselves.  Finally someone comes because I finally pull out bitch rank and get aggressive.  Everyone silently thanks me with their eyes.  I get what I need and I am out bitches!  LOL the line I could see was completely jealous however unable to be as aggressive so they stand suffering.  I would avoid this place if at all possible like the plague in the future.

My money was stolen on multiple occasions right out of my account.  They replaced it but geez then it would happen again.  I had to quit using that acct all together.  I still get emails years later now that say you just logged into your account.  What?  WTF??  No I didnt.

I like this place.  Its the perfect place for the art student.  Its not huge like a Michaels.  When you walk in they greet you and try to help you right away.  Most of them seem to know exactly what they are talking about almost like they might even be artists themselves unlike the Michaels chick last night that said she didnt know anything about any of the markers they had locked up in jail.  Arent you tired of hearing I dont know from these A holes?  What ever happened to I dont know let me find out or let me get someone that knows something.  Argh I am so tired of stupid people!!  and back to review.....You can also see everything they have and they dont lock it up like they do at Michaels.  They also have really good coupons here 50% etc. so make sure to sign up for those.

The entrance was confusing.  When you walk in its like a deli and to the back is the restaurant.  The employees look at you like you are an idiot and then finally they break down and point to the back where the restaurant is.  The hostess station had 3 or 4 people standing around and one extremely rude girl that took charge.  We asked how long the wait was it was a long time but she said you can go to the back patio and possibly get a seat.  We had never been there before so we asked is there a table available?  The rude girls response was "we dont know" since its first come we dont keep track of it for you.  you will have to see if there is one available.  We walked through and obviously there was no open table which the dumb B already knew.  Really bad vibe from this place.  Really rude staff.  Staff seems ultimately annoyed that you had the audacity to walk in and expect to eat there.  It was almost like "is this really happening right now?"   That was our first and last visit we walked out after the hostess was a big b and I was completely bummed because the restaurant is beautiful.  I have wanted to try it for a few years now but I cant put up with that kind of treatment.  The management here must be the absolute worst otherwise there wouldnt be so many hateful people working here.

Best ground beef enchiladas in the valley.  The red sauce is to die for and they are not affiliated with the chain Garcia's so no disgusting food drowning in oil here.    I have been coming here since the 90's and sometimes drive out of my way from Tempe to get their enchiladas.    They also have another building on the same property that has a drive through serving the same food as the restaurant.

This is supposed to be a healthy eating establishment.  I am usually on a very restricted diet no sugar no starch as well as the use of HCG and most diets now a days seem to be jumping on the same bandwagon.  Its all about eating clean.  Hormone free meats, fruits and veggies thats it so when I took a look at the low carb menu that came with hash browns for every low carb entree I was a little confused and disappointed but rather than try and decipher their menu I just told the lady taking my order that I needed something with virtually no calories like an egg beater omelet she said we can make you an egg white omelet which isnt really my preference but I figured my choices were pretty limited so I said o.k. then I sat down pretty much prepared to hate whatever they brought me.  These people know how to make boring egg whites taste good.  It came on a bed of greens with tomatoes and onions as I requested along with a few slices of avocado and a very tasty pesto sauce just enough to give it flavor.  I loved it and felt extremely satisfied even though it must have been under 250 calories.  I would definitely go here again and order the same.  Make sure you get there early for breakfast because seating is very limited inside and out.  There is also a drive through.

Really bad food.  They use cheapest cuts of meat.  Ordered chicken egg foo young it was very dense. Chicken was thight meat reminded me of buffet crap.  Dumplings worst ever must be frozen.  Beef on stick omg is that beef?  Talk about overcooked fatty mystery meat.  Curry chicken seemed like the only thing they cooked from scratch it wasn't that bad but they laoded it down w cheap onions and carrots.  Sweet n sour chicken was deep fried chicken w sauce on side.  Pretty much low budge buffet food but very expensive.  Never again what a waste.  My husband literally picked it all up in disgust and threw that shit in the garbage.  Company said they would refund my money and get back to me they didnt and they didnt.  They suck read the reviews first all the good ones have to be relatives friends or bullshit.

Easy to get around this small airport.  Costs less to fly.  I love it.  The only thing that isnt so fun is having to board the plane when the weather is hot since you have to walk outside and wait in the sun but otherwise its great.

Really good fresh Baja style Mexican food that is much better than many restaurants in the valley.  One of my newest faves is the blackened tillapia taco.  Low in calories and big on taste.  Just 1 or 2 will fill you up.

This place is pretty good and pretty healthy.  Love restaurants with healthy non kill you type foods.  Our favorite here is the bbq chicken salad and the habenero pizza.

I went in with a laundry list of issues to have looked at.  I paid double to go here rather than to my primary dr. because primary would only address 1 or 2 issues at a time.  Seriously?  Anyway I called around and Nextcare said we will take care of all of it.  For instance sore elbow, need a prescription filled, feeling sick, rash.  Dr. ignored all issues except the one that bothered me the most which was exactly what primary had wanted to do.  Nextcare dr. told me I had an incurable disease that I would have for the rest of my life without even looking at it.  He assured me that I had it though in a very condescending manner.  I was so upset that I called their head office and made a formal complaint and asked for my money back so I could visit another dr.  They completely understood gave me money back and offered to have me visit same clinic next day to visit another dr.  I did that.  The new dr. said I did not have this insane incurable disease that the idiot told me I had the day before.  She was better because she at least looked before telling me something stupid and then she abruptly ushered me into the hallway like we were done heres a prescription see ya.  I hadnt addressed some of the things I came in for so I am trying to ask her in the hallway right in front of 3 employees that just stood there listening to our conversation.  It was beyond embarrassing.  I tried to move around the corner so the punks milling about couldnt hear my private conversation with the dr. but she was done and had tuned out the minute she figured out the other dr. was a moron so she never addressed all the issues I came in for either.  This was one huge debacle.  I would never purposely go back to these idiots.  I had to make a 3rd visit to my primary dr. same week due to their complete incompetence.  I told the patient liaison at the corp office that I was completely pissed how can this a hole go around handing out these types of diagnoses without even looking??  She doesnt know.

I love it here and I frequent this place almost daily.  The only negative I can think of is the parking layout and layout of the roads.  Someone was on drugs when they designed this place.

Went in to buy car stereo.  Girl in that dept was not helpful she sucked beyond belief.  my husband had to keep trying to calm me down.  I kept telling him that bitch is lazy she needs to pull the box to give us the specs or look it up online.  She kept oky dokying me and just giving me the easiest answer to not have to do a thing.  Later I went home and looked up all the question I had on the product I was interested in.  She told at least 10 bull shit lies because she was a dumb ass lazy person.  Great price but you have to do all the work.  Make sure you do your homework or you will end up with the wrong thing!

Don't get ranch chicken salad it's swimming in too much dressing, too many chips, too much salt on those chips, has a weird taste, literally almost no chicken, tiniest little pieces I have ever seen almost like they ran out of chicken and I got the scraps oh and wheres the lettuce??????  This place doesnt usually screw up.

They have been messing it up lately.  I havent been back for months.  Having the wagging tits in your face with the big smiles and what are you doing today is starting to get old.  Everyone is obviously forced to make conversation and to start by asking what are you guys up to today?  Come on you guys it starts to feel like an intrusion and we know its forced which is why its becoming uncomfortable.  You guys are doing everything else right.  Lose the forced buddy buddy stuff that is now starting to work against you and let conversation happen naturally instead.  Last few times my coffee wasnt right so now I just make it at home.

Our waitress was a little weird.  She had dentures and kept spitting on my face unintentionally.  She told us she had dentures.  She made weird inappropriate jokes that made us uncomfortable.  The food was not too bad but not memorable either.  Both the hubby and I agree we might go back but have to get over our last visit first.

Love this place.  I am a filet mignon snob and I dont think I have ever sent one back.  Seems nowadays they can almost never get it right but these people keep on doing it.  My hub and I absolutely love Happy Hour here.  I like red wine and their house is nice and a 9 oz pour for just $4.  My hub gets the orange drink not sure what its called but you will see it on menu and OMG thats as good as it gets!  I would have that one but sugar sticks straight to all my body parts in the form of fat so I stick to my red wine.  We love the snap peas/asparagus and the goat cheese on crackers or something you will see that too :-)

I have to take back my 5 star rating.  This place has slowly been getting worse.  First they took our favorites off the happy hour menu which was the snap peas and asparagus.  Next they changed the quality of scallops from really nice big ones to tiny cracked up walmart looking scallops.  The type I find on sale at walmart and would never buy.  They sent me a coupon for my birthday that expired 2 days before my actual birthday so my husband and I gave it another try.  The service was good but the food was lacking.  I made a point of telling my server that I noticed the difference in quality when it came to the scallops on top of the filet mignon oscar.  I asked him to make sure I didnt get the low quality tiny ones so he said something to the kitchen.  They were a little bit better than they have been but still not the quality that I had become used to when dining there.  Ordered the filet medium and it came out well done.  First time they ever ruined a steak which really annoyed me but I didnt get a chance to tell the server.  Manager came around checking and I just had to tell her the truth.  I told her I cant keep coming back here and justify these prices when the quality is starting to take a dive.  Since I had a $25 birthday coupon they took that off as well as the glass of wine that I had.  If I were the manager I would have comped the entire meal happy bday sorry if we didnt meet up to your expectations and to ensure that my customers would return and give us another shot to impress I would give some kind of a coupon to make sure that happened.  At this point I don't think we will be back :-(

Its been a year since I have been here to my once favorite restaurant that we used to visit almost weekly.  Since they sent me another birthday coupon my husband, daughter, and I gave it another try.  It was just not like it used to be.  We were disappointed again.  The quality of shrimp they use now on top of the Oscar filet is just not worth it for more than $30.  The steak was overcooked etc. I could keep on but I dont feel like it anymore.

Last visit was not fun.  I needed help in the paint isle and the two employees in the area wanted to have a conversation that I had to continually interrupt to find this or that etc. and they would even stand on tippy toes and point out the direction of what I was looking for rather than showing me so that they could get back to their juicy conversation.  Hey ladies when customers come in could you please just fake it like you are helpful.  That might even get us out of your face sooner so you can get back to the gossip.

Paradise had lousy service today so we just went across the street to Wildflower.  Got the BBQ Chipotle Chicken salad.  It was pretty good but I do wish they had a lighter version of the salad dressing.  I didnt realize till after I ate it of course when I looked up the nutrition info that the salad dressing had 20 grams of sugar and the whole salad with dressing was 27 grams.  While looking at nutrition info I noticed it said there was feta in the salad.  Feta?  What feta?  I called in to let them know.  Nick the manager asked me where I was located.  He was prepared to have someone bring me the feta.  Now that is some serious customer service.  I told him I scarfed salad too late and I wouldnt make you do that either.  He is replacing the salads for next visit.  :-)

Very nice hotel.  Went to the District for happy hour.  There were only 2 girls serving the crowded room but they both did what seemed to be an outstanding job.  Food was very good.  My fav was the mac and cheese.

Last couple times were not good.  Service was slower than usual and food wasnt as good as it usually is.  I dont like the coffee here at all.  Each time I get it by accident I tell my husband please remind me next time that I do not like their coffee and not to get it.  I wish they would serve something nicer like Douwe Eggberts (same coffee they serve at Crackers)  This last visit our waitress brought us HOT chocolate for our 4 year old in a spill able Styrofoam cup which she also put a straw in.  Thankfully my husband took a sip to test it first and burned his flipping mouth off.  I am sure the girl was too young to realize what a mistake that was but come on lets have a little common sense.  Would have been much better to bring in the mug it comes in and to let us know it was very hot and of course you wouldnt put a straw into it.  The time before this we waited forever for our food it was almost 40 minutes.  Not sure if I already reviewed that time but it was horrible.  They didnt even put cheese in my omelette.  We used to be regulars but fugget about it.

This is my favorite place in the valley.  There is nothing that can compare to the beauty of a walk along the water here.  I love to be on the North side which is the side that people rarely go to.  They are missing out because its all redone with volleyball courts and new walk ways and gardens and the view of the other side is just awesome especially at night which is my absolute favorite time to go walking there.

Very nice store.  They had a couple really cute dogs walking around and one in baby crib that was just adorable.  This is a great place to go for one of kind items or great gifts for the dog lover but nobody paid attention to us.  Nobody made eye contact nobody said hello so we just walked out.

Sugar free white mocha iced.  Really nice people and the coffee is good too.  They really want to make sure you like it.  If you dont they will make it again.  Get a stamp card too your 11th one is free.  Monday or Tuesday is double stamp day.

They say you get lobster but they lie.  Pretty much pissed.  I called before arriving and asked if the lobster was included they said yes but we were informed after paying and being seated that is no longer the case and its been that way for quite a while apparently.  Food not worth 43 bucks a person.  I really didn't like the food.  It was cold, old, with films on top of everything.  I don't know maybe it was a slow Sunday night.  Took one bite of everything appealing to me and nothing but the crab was good enough to make it to a second bite.  I would never waste my money here again.

I was disappointed with the food.  I havent been to a La Parrilla Suiza since I left Tucson in 93 and I had hoped this would be what I remembered.  I even drove way out of the way just to have good experience but it was not good.  It was pretty bland and boring.  The chips were good and the service was o.k. even though the server forgot the beans I ordered but after I got the food had a couple bites I was already over it and didnt care about the beans anymore.  Wish I could find a good Mexican joint!

The manager was very pleasant greeting me at the door which was nice after a day in Snottsdale where people didnt even look you in the eye or acknowledge your presence in any way.  I left at closing time.  Manager let me out of store and asked if I was parked near by.  I said yes right there pointing to the first parking spot in front.  She said o.k. great have a good night while she watched me to make sure that I got to my car safely then she waived and said have a good night.  Wow what a really great person that woman is.  She needs a raise!

Usually I have a really good experience here and thats why they are getting 1 more star today than they deserved for my last visit ok wait I have to take the extra star back the more I think about it so forget it this experience was a 2 star!  Thankfully I had the all you can drink mimosa which helped to make the experience much more tolerable however it was very difficult flagging someone down for a refill so that was not too fun.  I ordered the potato and egg taco.  The waitress said do you want bacon I said sure thinking it would be on the side she brought me 3 plain tacos with eggs and a slice of bacon in it.  It was not good but I ate one cuz I was hungry.  She asked what was wrong and I said its not what I ordered its not the potato egg taco she said oh ok well I charged you for the one you half ass ate.  O.K. whatev

Went to see Robert Cray.  He didnt play very long.  I would never waste my money to see him again.  Husband is the fan and he agrees that it was a little disappointing.  People behind me were pure A Holes pissed off that we arrived and put an end to the little window they had.  The A Holes would not shut up about it.  I controlled myself and said nothing which is unusual.  When concert was over we went to casino and put $80 bucks into a machine that sucked it right up.  No wins just pure losses.  Went to the Blue Coyote Cafe.  Not impressed.  I had mac and cheese it was bland and tasteless.  Husband had spinach salad.  Said it was the worst spinach salad that he had ever had in his lifetime.  He literally took 2 bites and was done.  Waitress asked how it was and I said he didnt like his salad.  She just laughed at me.  I told her it was not funny and that he didnt eat it.  She laughed again and walked away and brought us the bill.  She didnt take the uneaten salad off.  Husband pays bill and I am beyond pissed so I ask for manager.  I wait.  and I wait.  Then I wait some more.  Finally I told the girls at front what happened.  They understood.  They tried to get manager so I waited and I waited til I said forget it I am out.  Huge waste of my time and money that night.

I really liked this store and the variety of different perfumes available from around the world.  The store owner was very nice and helpful.  I prefer to get a sample of a perfume to wear for a couple days before I decide to buy.  Who wants a $200 bottle of perfume that you decide you dont like after a week, you know??  This store would have definitely earned 5 stars if I had walked out with a sample of something that I liked.  This  would also be good for the store because it would help me to remember what it was that I liked and I would return to buy.

Smash was good the first few times but this location is lacking.  My first bad experience here was when I called in to place an order and the guy taking my order gave me a real hard time.  I asked for a smash burger with cheese no ketchup or smash sauce he acted stupid like he couldn't figure out which burger I was ordering s aid they are all smash burgers and I said wow dude I don't know nobody has ever given me a hard time about this.  He was a jerk so we decided to go to another location instead of enduring more drama funny thing is the other place knew what I was ordering and they didn't give me a hard time.  It's been a while so we went in today got haystack onions that were drowning in puddle of grease and hamburgers also very greasy.  Husband said this was the worst it's ever been.  Looks like it's time to give smash a rest.

Not really that good. Wish I wrote the review then because I remember there were quite  a few things I wanted to say but lucky for them I waited on review and food was just not good enough that I remember how we vowed not to ever return.  Both hubby and I not impressed and not coming back.  I would suggest you start reading your reviews and get a new cook or try some new recipes because your food no longer works and I would like you to be successful because I love Mexican food and I want more places to go.

Got the Deluxe pizza and a meatball sub.  The sub is not what is pictured on their website.  They do not put whole meatballs in the sub instead you get 2 1/3 meatballs.  2 very small meatballs are sliced in half and a tiny slice of another to fill the long toasted hot dog bun like "sub" .  My husband just picked up the $6 sandwich and said wow that is one tiny little sub.  Ya it was!  Wow not even subway would jack you like that.  The bread had turned into a paste like substance just like a hot dog bun soaked in water.  Ate the meatballs that were not very tasty at all and threw out the rest.  The deluxe pizza was good though.  Not the best dough but we are not really into fattening dough anyway.  I actually liked the pizza better than pizza hut but they get 2 stars cuz the quality of the rest of the order was pretty cheap and awful.

What is it with this place?  Why do these particular employees of this store have such a weird attitude towards customers?  My husband whos the most mild mannered guy goes into the store to order a salad today .  There were 4 people behind the counter over by the pick up area.  They were talking or milling about who knows.  Waited 10 minutes then you had to finally say hey can I order something?  They said oh sure did you want to buy a paper?  He said I wanted to order some food actually and the girl says oh.  So that was enough to piss him off he said screw it I will go over to Wild Flower right next door.  Apparently they had just screwed up 3 orders and my husband overheard someone asking hey whats with this order whats with this one and each person behind the counter replied I dont know, i dont know, etc.   So all of that was just not worth it to him.  He didnt want his order screwed up too.  just wanted to get that out there because the experience is almost always the same there oh and I am PISSED because I wanted a fuji apple salad!  I was mad that my husband didnt take the torture and get me my salad so I now put the blame on you Paradise.  Do something about your people or your processes.  Teach your employees to greet people and to treat each person that comes in as if they are going to order something!  Make it so that it is not uncomfortable for us to go into your store and try to interact with your unwilling and uninviting employees.  Teach them some teamwork.  Why do each of them act like oh thats not my job.  That is so weird and even gross behavior.

Giving 2 stars because they are trying really hard.  I totally wanted to love this place and so did my husband.  We walked up and the wait staff dispersed and came to the door it was weird we felt uncomfortable so we went next door like we werent actually going the Herb n Flavors and we asked them how it was next door.  The girl went on and on about how great they were and that Fox news was there recently they are supposed to be healthy and free of hormones etc. which is what we are all moving towards now a days.  Its nice to have more choices available so we even though we got a weird vibe from that girl almost like she was paid to give good review we thought lets check it.  We asked waitress what was good etc. and ordered based on her recommendations.  My husband had a gyro with artichoke dip on it.  The bread was as hard as a cracker literally sounded like charcoal out of fire breaking.  Broke it off used it as cracker for artichoke dip which was ok and the gyro meat had nice flavor but the fossil like bread was a turn off.  I had the steak tacos which were not good.  Just all around no flavor in spite of having avocado and chipotle sauce.  We tasted sauce separately and nothing no flavor or not enough just bland.  My husband ordered the french press coffee which was $6 omg what a waste of $6 WOW.  its just 4 tablespoons of coffee grounds steeping in water at your table definitely not worth $6.  Not sure why we did this but after reading reviews we thought lets even go further and try dessert.  They said the tiramisu was home made we tried it and again devoid of flavor lacking flavor not worth another $6 and also much smaller than most desserts at $6 not that I am complaining cuz I definitely dont need more but just stating the facts.  I felt bad for these people because they do have a great concept but the location is not a good one and the food is just too much for what you are getting and its really not that good on top of it.  I wanted to love it and our waitress did try so hard and the fouled up food not her fault so we tipped her well and we didnt complain cuz that is so uncomfortable and then they just think you are trying to take advantage and want your money back so instead I prefer to wish them well not come back and YELP it out :-)

I have been spoiled at the other location in Phx.  We had the conchita pibil I think is what they call it not sure but it was great there so we happened upon this place in Scottsdale and thought we would give it a try.    I got a chicken burrito that was ok but I would never get it again if I did happen to go back.  My husband got a 3 taco plate which was either $3.50 a taco or 10.00 for 3 and when it came out it was shockingly small next to my burrito that was just a regular size.  My husband says they were approximately 1-2 bite tacos and honestly that is not an exaggeration.  He finished his $10 tacos in 10 seconds flat still starving and asked to see the menu again.  He has never had to order another meal after eating a meal before just to satisfy his hunger.  This time we tried the appetizer I think it was carnitas that was soaked in coca cola or something.  It sounded good but it did not taste good.  The meat was extremely fatty and some pieces overcooked and tough even black.  I took 2 bites just to give it a fair shot but no just not good and he felt the same so the waiter was nice enough to take it off our bill.  The manager came over and we told her how we felt in the nicest way possible.  She thanked us for the feedback and then told us that she hoped we would try them again even after we said honestly after this experience we wouldnt be back.  Maybe we just made all the wrong choices.  Who knows?  I guess we won't find out.

This place was a great.  My husband gets credit for picking this place.  He planned a day at the museum and lunch here and it was a very nice experience all the way around.  First we headed over to the restaurant and picked a nice shady spot out on the patio.  It was beautiful outside, the weather was amazing and the view of the sculptures, and greener was very pleasing.  The service was excellent.  They were very quick and helpful suggesting some of the best things on the menu.  My husband had the rueben and the sweet potato salad which was out of this world amazing.  I told our server and he gave me a really nice picture/recipe card for it.  It was a few months ago and I dont remember what I had other than I remember it was so good no complaints from me but what won the whole meal was that insane sweet potato salad.  Whats nice about having lunch here first is that you can tour the museum and burn off those calories.   Also the light rail drops off right in front of the museum.  Another little tip is if you are an MCC student you get into the museum for free.

I love this place.  They are what they say they are.  Healthy fast food with a drive thru!  I love the morning buzz and so does everyone else that has tried it.  The burritos are so big they feed two people and the croissant wt/egg cheese and pesto sauce is really good.  They are a bit pricey and they dont provide nutrition info is why they dont get all 5 stars.

Hated it from the moment we stepped foot on the patio.  Very little seating inside and out.  Staff utterly rude.  Some drunk jerk pushed his way practically on top of me to order bartender could care less he preferred to help drunk pig over me waiting who was already waiting patiently.  We said forget walked out.  Both husband and I agree not our style.  We prefer Gordon Biersch.  Will never go back.

Spaghetti squash marinara 260 cals and doesn't taste like it!  Completely love this place!  Husband and I have been avoiding this place for years because it was always unhealthy with mostly fried choices.  We decided to be a little bit bad one day and went in to share something.  What a pleasant surprise to find they had some really great healthy choices and the calories listed right there on the menu so you dont have to guess or feel annoying by having to ask.  My husband got the spaghetti squash which I never had before and would never in a million years choose myself in fact the 260 calories listed made me turn my nose up thinking yuck that will be tasteless.  I got some whiskey or something flavored chicken cant remember with garlic mashed cauliflower which was a little over 300 calories.  Mine was amazing, tasty, and healthy and the whole time I was eating it I wished I had ordered that spaghetti squash cuz it was even better than mine!  Love it and will definitely be back.

Its hard to review this place because it lacks in customer service but has great food.  Whats really annoying about this place is their separate stations.  One station for salads where the salad people cant talk to you unless you are ordering a salad and a sandwich section where you guessed it.  LOL you better be ordering a sandwich or they are gonna get pissed!  Sounds hilarious oh and it is but this does happen and I am sure that it hasnt just happened to both me and my husband a few times.  Anyway only because we made the grave mistake of speaking to the sandwich guy who told us we had to speak to the salad guy standing right next to him have we ever really had a problem with this place.  That vibe has been going on awhile and I feel it at every single Paradise I visit so its obviously a problem management should look into.  I think it might be appropriate to have cross trained people that can help you whether you order a salad, a cookie, or a sandwich.  Know what I mean?  Anyway the food is the only reason this place survives I love the Fuji apple turkey salad and it happens to have the lowest calories which is awesome since its the best.  My husband likes the steak and blue cheese salad and it is freakin good.  Lately we have been getting a couple cookies and the chocolate chip with coconut on top is the best.

The ambiance is cool but we went a few weeks ago for the first time while it was still 100 degrees out at midnight and one night out for a walk we decided to stop by and check it out.  The misters were turned off at 8:30 pm just a couple minutes before we got there and they would not turn them back on.  I checked the temperature on my phone it was a very uncomfortable 97 degrees so that was a little weird.  We sat down and had the kobe beef sliders and a glass of red wine.  My wine was $8 or $9 cant remember other than it being on the more expensive side for how horrible and warm it was.  I didn't expect the wine to be warm.  That was a first for me, warm wine yuck.  I mean really warm not just room temp warm we are talkin warm warm.  I didnt think there was anything special about the sliders.  Great location, great outdoor patio, great for people watching but service, food and drinks not good.  Overall pretty disappointed.

Unfortunately this is my only means of communicating with you since you will not answer your phone.  I heard about the 9 stamp day for at least a week by several employees.  I go through this location usually several times a week and on my last visit I had a conversation with one of the guys there and asked him about 9 stamp day just two days ago MONDAY and he said yes but you will have to get a quad shot to get the 9 stamps.  I had zero idea what exactly he was talking about comparing sizes and prices didnt get what he was saying other than you spend more you get stamps which is fine with me so husband went in this a.m to get coffee and they told him no we dont have 9 stamp here thats at the Lemon location.  WTF?  WTF????????  At least you got my coffee right today!  but you ruined my day with the 9 stamp bullshit and now I have to go to another location.  Totally pissed off and you guys owe me a free coffee in the least!

Worst sandwich I have ever had from any place ever.  So bad it pissed me off after 2 bites of yuck that I didnt eat the rest.  The meat is beyond gross with all kinds of salt and preservatives and other chemicals added.  The quality to me was something like the cheapest deli meat you would find in the grocery store but not from the deli.  You know what I am talking about.  Mystery meat.

This was my first visit here.  Liked the location which is quiet on a busy street.   Probably quiet because of the time of year.  People don't usually hang around for the 120 degree temperatures here.  Loved the banana and the chocolate custard.  Tried coffee with pieces of chocolate in it which I did not like as much because it wasnt as smooth and creamy as the banana and chocolate were.  I will definitely be back for more.  Forget about ice cream!

I came back for more today got to the door and they were closed.  Tow more people showed up as we were leaving.  Hopefully they consider extending their hours meanwhile I am waiting for the door to open at 5 :). Oh and updated stars to 5 I have no idea what I was thinking with the 4 stars!

I do not have good things to say about this overpriced drive thru.  I dont get the obsession with it.  The food is not good.  I have had 3 salads they all sucked.  How you order through the drive thru is weird.  There is no speaker they use their employees to stand there in the drive thru to take your order.  They hand you a menu and wait for you to decide.  its so uncomfortable I would just drive away but my husband was driving and he is so much nicer than me.
