Went there for the first time today and since its two hours from my home I had to get a little of everything ... Catfish,BBQ ribs,fish sandwich, peach cobbler fried pound cake and a cheeseburger... Everything was amazing!! That peach cobbler takes you back to them old school days of watching big mamma or Madea( depending on how you were raised) roll out the dough and peel the peaches from scratch !!! I am not joking!!! It's that good! I hate peach cobbler that looks like vomit! I like to see the peaches and the crust... Not have the shit all blended in together ewwwww I wish they could Ship their Peach cobbler

Excellent service and the peach cobbler is incredible!! I do not like cobbler that has a ton of slimy peaches and little bit of crust. This cobbler has the right amount of everything especially crust. The catfish was fresh and hot and I couldn't wait to get home before I took a piece out the bag!! I also purchased a rib sandwich with extra BBQ sauce and they over delivered. The meat fell off the bone and the sauce was amazing... I drive 60 miles one way just to get it and I suggest everyone stop by on the way home to take advantage of the best thing ever!!!!!

Every time I go through the drive thru I get finically raped!! I asked for a whopper jr no tomato heavy mayo and cheese plus an extra slice for .60 extra..also some onion rings...drove home sat down..opened my wrapper and low and behold it was a regular whopper jr and the onion rings were cold. I was pissed so I called to ask them ...WHY...WHY DO U GUYS KEEP JERKING ME OVER. The snotty manager said well bring me your receipt and I will remake it for u. I said listen my family is now sitting down for dinner and I don't feel like driving back to you, she said well call back Monday and speak with the GM. All I could do was take a deep breath and find something in the fridge. I don't want to blame the restaurant..I would rather blame the crew that works this shift. They are horrible irresponsible kids that don't give a damn. I hope Corp sees this and in order to gain me back as a customer I would like my money refunded as well as a few free whopper coupons. I am sick of having to call them 9 out of 10 times to have them correct an order. This is not that complex people..no tomato heavy mayo and extra cheese...is that too much to ask when I am paying for this? It's not like I'm eating here for free.

I took my cousin from Pasadena to the Scottsdale location and the service was horrible! I had to keep asking the waitrss for things and finally she just stopped coming to our table. Yes I understand they were busy ( Full of white people ) and they had to focus on the other guest but what about us? My cousin asked for the waffles with the whipped cream and strawberries and the waitress asked if she was sure? I assume she asked cause my cousin is overweight !! We got the meal without the cream and strawberries and took the hint. We paid and left and will NEVER RETURN!!

The catfish is amazing..but we go for the ribs..my son is 11 and he can eat two full slabs. My two older kids love the ribs,cheese fries, and corn! I know we should try different things but don't fix whats not broken! Regardless of which location we go to we get the same excellent service! Oh yes...let's not forget about the bread and cinnamon butter...ooh la la

I think the guy I met was either the manager or co owner..I just moved here from San tan and this was the first place we visited. It was pouring down rain and my kids were craving pizza and wings. We had been moving all day and so many things were left in boxes I could not dare cook. I watched this man make everything from scratch and as I was asking him questions he actually answered them with enthusiasm. The food is great but the customer service is incredible. I placed a phone order and was given the wrong food. When I called in and explained the problem the same guy was very apologetic and offered to replace the whole order free. He said the young lady was new so I totally understood. No one is perfect but the fact that he cared so much about how I felt was amazing. I am a lifetime customer!

This place is amazing.. any time I have extra cash I spend it right here! the service is amazing and what I love is the fact that I could order a to go order and still get the same amount of food and bread as if I were sitting at the table to dine in. This is something that many restaurants lack! when ordering take out many times they take away a soup or salad... not at this place! The seafood is always fresh and the staff always have a smile!!! I love it here

We went back tonight and I have to say again this place is amazing. I had my three children plus my niece and nephew and spent only 50 bucks..I mean we ate very well!! I had the Sunday special which was two chicken breast and three sides and that chicken was amazing! Big and juicy and yes it was deep fried!!! This place is amazing not to mention the retail side that just calls to you as your leaving!! Lol

They are perfect every time... Some advice... If you don't like the idea of having to wait more than ten minutes for delivery.. Get off your ass and pick up the food yourself.. Don't call in bitching to the waitress/Cashier/Host as she has nothing to do with how fast you get the order!!

I went there yesterday for the first time and the staff was wonderful. I was blown away by the "Kool-Aid" fountain! They were fast and professional and when I got home the wings were hot juicy and properly seasoned!! I love this place and my kids have asked that I stop by again today to grab 50 more wings!!!!

My sister took my daughter and myself there yesterday as we were celebrating my daughters 18 th birthday. We went there on our way to arrowhead mall and my sister actually got off the freeway and said I'm sorry you guys have to try this place near my home. I walked in and fell in love with the decor. My sister got the apple pie cupcake and my daughter got the chocolate. I was not sure what I wanted so I simply got the vanilla!! When I tell you I was blown away I damn well mean it. We were all silent as we sat there eating our cupcakes then discussed Using them for our monthly tea party we have with our mother. I think the lady behind the counter was the owner and she suggested some type of cookie that would be perfect for a tea party and although I agree....I would be crazy not to order a case of her vanilla CC's. I only ate half of my cc as we were headed to dinner but right after dinner I went back to my sisters car, got out my cc and ate it right in the parking lot. Later on that night..well actually at 4 am I woke up craving that cc. My sister and I believe In supporting local businesses and if you feel the same way ( even if you don't) you must try this cup cake shop...the cakes are moist and light and the topping is like crack cocaine....you are sure to become addicted! I promise I will be back this week and we will be ordering every month for our families monthly tea time!!

My daughter received her drivers license today! My daughter had failed twice at the Mvd in north Scottsdale due to the pressure and stress... This place is amazing and the staff is incredibleI know that we all complain about identity theft in this country yet get mad when a company does their job in making sure this does not happen! So what if we have to wait a little longer and so what if they ask for the right documents ... No one is going to risk their business to create short cuts in order to please customers! We are a border state and therefore I understand that they have to go above and beyond to make sure the job is done right! I don't want a person to take my identity and this company makes sure that won't happen!!!

My daughter received her drivers license today! My daughter had failed twice at the Mvd in north Scottsdale due to the pressure and stress... This place is amazing and the staff is incredible  I don't understand why people complain about this place? It's like they get mad because short cuts can't be made. I have seen customers be extremely rude to the staff all because they are doing their job. The state sets the rules and they simply follow it. It seems to me that the reason people complain is because they think by coming here they can get away with what they can't get away with going to a field office Mvd! That's my story and I'm sticking to it!

I just walked past this place in my way to AMC and seen a line out the door... After the wack ass movie I went inside and was blown away! When you place your order is when your donut is placed in the hot oil... You watch as they make your craving come to life!! EXCELLENT... Just plain excellent!!

I was waiting for Lab Corp to come back from lunch so I went to Yelp to see what was good to eat in the area. When I seen there was an actual Seafood Place that didn't cost an arm and a leg I hurry up and go there. The atmosphere was excellent. It was quiet (minus the normal table chatter)..very clean with a Back East Feel to it!! I love how the menu is on the board and what I really love is how they wrap your food up in Butcher paper yet it looks like an average to go box. Now the food.... I ordered the Lunch Special and that was 2 pieces of fish some homemade coleslaw and a large drink. They make homemade tarter sauce and Slaw and that tarter was so good I could drink it by itself!! The Onion Rings are freaking amazing and the batter they use is something out of this world. To be honest..it taste like some old family recipe from Wales, London...lmaoooo I am totally hooked and the staff was so cool it feels like I have known them for years. This is a really great place and its worth driving out of the way to taste their Fish or Clams....or hell, they can deep fry my house-shoes if it means I can have more of that batter and Tarter sauce. Also I met a really Wonderful Man while I was having lunch...I think he said his name was Bo Olsen but I could not find him on FB!!  If you see this Bo, Please leave a message about this place!! You never know...We may have our Wedding here..LMAOOOO -KK

My cheese fries and wings were cold because the kids left to run the place were playing around a lot... I can't get over how they reached over the counter and started playing with the dough.... I asked for extra cheese and she forgot... I was tired after waiting an hour for two cheese fries two wings and two pizzas... I hope the manager sees this!!

They are over priced and they are getting over on poor white that think this is real soul food. Very nice place to sit down and chill and drink but the food is just alright. It's a shame that this place started off as Ms. Whites and with her doing the cooking make every bite memorable... Now it's commercial like and it sucks! The best place to find soul food are in Those little whole in the walls on the west and south side!!

As of now I'm just mad because I have to wait until noon for them to open they door.... I've never known a place that's open for lunch but don't open until 12 pm.... But I will run to Walmart then come back at 12 to get my order then write my review!! Stay tuned!! Now that I have tasted the food and service I give it five stars plus!!!! The fish is out of this world and they make their own tarter sauce!! It's amazing! The mac n cheese is fantastic! It has a bit of a sweet taste to it and that's what makes it incredibly satisfying  I did not care for the potato salad but everything else was amazing especially the kool aid! The service is amazing.... I don't know if they are a husband and wife team but they work well together!  I hope this place knocks lo-los on they ass!!
