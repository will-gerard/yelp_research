Okay this review is long overdue. This is my favorite restaurant of all time. I can't believe that I just found out about Abuelo's in November 2012. But I can tell you that I go there on a weekly basis to get my avocado enchiladas, papas and beans. Plus the chips and salsa are to die for. If you like hot ask the waiter or waitress to bring you the inferno sauce, it is the best but only available upon request. I have tried many other items on the menu and they are all awesome. My husband's favorite is the stuffed chicken medallions but he is always trying new specials and they never disappoint. If you have not tried Abuelo's you are missing out on some incredible food.

I wish I could give zero stars that's how bad it was. First off my order had rice but the lady that dropped it off was not my waitress and gone so fast I couldn't even say anything. My waitress no where to be found. I scrapped the rice off and left it on the side of the table in plain view. My chile relleno was so bland and the so called egg batter was only a cooked egg with zero flavor which I added to the rice plate. Waitress finally walks by does not acknowledge us. I have eaten only two bites. I finally have to ask bus boy for check. Waitress comes over gets money. I'm heated so say nothing. She comes back and says to me do you want a to go box. Are you serious? Bye the way at this point I have added everything back on the original plate and set in on the edge of the table. I just laughed and said no way. We will never eat here again!

Best sushi in Arizona! If it is not on the menu Sake will make it for you! Also the freshest sushi around. Nice atmosphere & reasonable prices! My husband and I eat here 2-4 times a month and are never disappointed. My favorite is the white tuna sashimi and my husband's is the sumo roll!

I never get tired of this place or the service! Sake and his wife are absolutely the best and the sushi is to die for. Nothing like fresh tuna in Arizona! You will not be disappointed.

Okay so my hidden gem of a movie theatre is no longer a secret. They went and updated their seats to comfy recliner chairs and added call ahead ticket purchase and seat selection. Now I have to book ahead a couple days so I get my favorite seat. But honestly there isn't a bad seat in this theatre. Keep up the great work and tell owners to add a loyalty cup. We love Regal Gilbert.

Took my husband last night for his birthday steaks were cooked to perfection! We had the crab cakes for appetizer and they were so tender and moist I can't describe in words. I would have given 5 stars but the scallop and lobster that came with my filet were a little over cooked.

Went here for my friends birthday dinner and even though I am that one person that always orders fish at a steak house. Texas Roadhouse cooked it right! I would have given 5 stars for the cooked perfection but our server was not very attentive. My husband had the fall off the bone ribs and as far as I know everyone enjoyed their meals. Would definitely return, the price is outstanding and the food was great.

So we decided to go to The Keg last night because my friend was sick and could not go out for her birthday so no dinner plans and nothing  prepared. We have eaten here before and loved it. Ordered the goat cheese appetizer, they changed it (not as good as before). But my biggest complaint is I asked for my Salmon to be cooked as rare as they allow it to be cooked. The waiter said "It will be medium rare which is very moist and juicy, is that okay". It came out so dry I was unable to eat it. Now I'm telling you when he was serving it he had to know it looked dry. By the time the waiter said anything to me about the Salmon on my plate everyone else was done eating. Its just frustrating to me when you request something cooked one way and it is cooked the complete opposite.

We gave the Keg another try and I had to update my review. Food was great, atmosphere inviting and service was awesome. I had the lobster and filet and both were  cooked to perfection. My son had the chicken and ribs and my husband had the end-cut prime rib. Goat cheese appetizer has been removed from the menu and replaced with a baked brie that everyone should try.

My husband and I were out in Avondale working and decided to stop here for lunch instead of fast food. Thought we were going to grab a quick burger or something. To my delight they had a New Orleans Seafood entree. It was tilapia and shrimp with creole sauce. Of course as you know I ask for my seafood cooked lightly (med rare) can I just say cooked to perfection! It was fabulous, I can't rave enough. Hubby had a burger and the same thing, it was perfectly cooked with great flavor. He also had the salad bar which was stocked with wonderful fresh items. You can get a coupon on the retail me not app. for buy one entree get the 2nd 50% off!

My friend suggested we meet up at Chompie's early this afternoon. She was craving breakfast and I wanted lunch. The have an incredible menu, it's huge. My friend had the traditional breakfast and loved it. The potatoes didn't look like anything special but she said they tasted incredible. She also loved her bagel, homemade and so fresh. I had the Philly cheese steak, it was so tasty and the au jus sauce finished the flavored perfect. With a side of fresh fruit you can't go wrong. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because waitress brought us some free samples of the pastries and they were not good, very hard. We had planned on grabbing some pastries to go but didn't because of this. However as walking out we looked at pastry counter and everything looked incredible. If they give old pastries away free please don't as this may detour patrons from buying any!

Geoff and his crew are awesome, after trying two other landscapers a friend of ours referred me to Agave Tree and Landscaping. His crews are always on time, friendly and informative. Prices are wonderful and the finished job every other week meets our expectations. The best thing is the gentleman completing our service are clean and neatly groomed and they all speak English. I highly recommend this company.

Love Skin Gravy. I bought a Groupon and was very skeptical but I have had wonderful services and do not have one complaint. I do have to say my last service which was the dermaplanning was my favorite. My make-up has never looked so good, it goes on so much smoother and stays on longer. Highly recommend Skin Gravy and all of the ladies that work there

I took my teenage soon in to get a haircut during a event they sponsored, for clean water changes lives. Stacey did an amazing job and all of the proceeds were donated to this charity. It is nice to see a business donate their time and do good. We will definitely be returning to 20 Volume Salon & Spa very soon. I will highly recommend them to family and friends.

We had a Chandler Chamber of Commerce event at the Copper Still Moonshine Grill this evening and with over 100 members present I cannot say enough about the service of this establishment. Even the owner Chuck came by and introduced himself. Food was fabulous and we will definitely be back. Highly recommend!

Okay I'm a little behind in my reviews. Rae and I meet here for lunch on Wednesday and I was very impressed. Waitress was great, just the right amount of attention and very friendly with great suggestions on the food. We shared an order of yellow curry crab cakes. I can't wait to go back and try the yellow curry dish. Then for our entree we had the tofu and eggplant. It was incredible. I'm so excited to finally like a Thai restaurant that's near us. On a side note I had the cantaloupe martini and it was great as well. This may be our new lunch spot. My only suggestion is the clean up the patio and make it look alive. I understand it's to hot to sit out there this summer but it still needs to look presentable.

I honestly wish you could give zero stars. DO NOT purchase a monthly car wash from this company. My son has literally been trying to cancel it for months.  We went in the first time and cancelled. Went the next time and got documentation of the cancelation. Still being charged so finally had to have the bank get involved and pay for a stop payment. Its absurd how they handle this problem, I called corporate and they said he was still using the pass. That's pretty difficult when his trucks transmission is out. This is a complete scam.
