I can only speak to one food item here, and that's their tomato and mozzarella sandwich.  If they only served one sandwich, and I had to eat it for the rest of my life, then I would die a happy and full man.    We spent our honeymoon in Italy, traveling around the country and eating as if we had gone hungry the other 30 years of our life, and I swear this sandwich matches, and occasionally exceeds, the simple fare that was so overwhelmingly good across the country.  The sandwich is huge, and every time I think I'll have some leftover for later, and each time I prove myself wrong by eating every last crumb and wayward tomato.  One day I'll order something else, but then maybe I won't.

Just got my pup back after a day visiting the lovely ladies at Puff and Fluff.  We had been using a mobile groomer, and even tried a second one, but hated the diesel fumes and they weren't especially good with our dog, plus the cuts weren't that great.  I'm happy to report they were very sweet with my skittish mutt and gave him a very nice cut.  I'm completely happy with the people and their work, and no diesel fumes!  Many thanks!

Okay, I'm writing this review and giving them five stars because I love that this place still exists in the heart of big-box hell.  I want to pick this place up and smack Chandler with it, then go to Anthem and kick some ass.      I try to go here every time I need a household item, and even if they dont' have it, I love interacting with the crusty old guys who work there, who are not just crusty, but pretty knowledgable.  If they don't have it, they know where I can get it and once even called another store to check and see.  That's service.  To the person who was yelled at for parking in their spot: it says in huge letters on the spot that it's for Koller.  You should feel privileged to be yelled at by these retail heroes, who despite the $10 margaritas and $6 smoothies offered next door, still exist and provide you with a local alternative to the Home Despot.      I love these guys, especially the one with the ruler/suspenders, and I'll continue to shop here as long as they fight off the big boys.

Forget the haters: it's 110 outside and in 15 minutes I can pretend to be in an Ohio winter, even wear long sleeves!  Sure it's an old place, but it looks no better or worse than the places I skated up north, so I'm just happy with whatever I get.  Skates were good enough to get me through 2 hours on the ice, and everyone seemed happy, which was nice.  My son and I had a blast and it only cost us $16.  Can't go see a movie for that price, and there are so few ways for kids to exercise here in the summer, so hurray Arcadia Ice Arena.  My son and I can't wait to go back.

Travis is great.  I had a tech from another company come out and tell me that our AC unit needed a new $600 control board.  Sounded suspect, so I got a second opinion and glad I did.  Turns out my thermostat was wired incorrectly, and he fixed the problem in no time.  Hard to find an honest and competent company in the valley, so I feel lucky to have found one.

They sell bagels to Courtesy Chevrolet's cafe, and I couldn't believe my taste buds.  This bagel is equal to any I've ever had, even the old H&H in NYC.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'll be coming back to the Chevy dealer for breakfast because I live so far away from their shop.

I feel like I write too many five star reviews, but then I usually only review places I really like, and I really like Pino's.  I also really like Pino, the person.  i met him before I had his pizza, since I run into him at Lux some mornings while I'm having coffee.  Pino really couldn't be a nicer person, and for that reason alone I would patronize his business.  But the pizza....  There's a lot of pizza in the valley, and I would dare to say there's a lot of good pizza in the valley, but when I say "pizza," my family immediately begins to salivate and we all say Pino's at the same time.  I would guess there are at least fifty places to eat pizza between Pino's and my house, but I don't even bother because I know it would be disappointing by comparison.  We always have the same two things.  A giant cheese pizza and a big house salad.  it's enough to feed three skinny people with slices left over for the next day.  I once ate the rest of the pizza there, but I was both sick and happy at the same time.  I can't speak for any of the other food there and will never be able to since I will ALWAYS order his fabulous pizza.  I've been to Italy on several occasions and his pizza is just as good as any I had there.  Of course, Pino is from the old country, so he brings that love for good food with him.    I'm not sure why I'm writing this review at 11:30pm, since they are closed and now I really want a slice.  Why does Pino have to sleep?

I would like to give Grimaldi's higher praise, but it just wasn't as good as I had hoped.  I knew of their reputation long ago, since I occasionally have business in NYC, but never made it to the original restaurant.  Plus, you can find good pizza on pretty much any corner in the city, so there's no need to make a special trip.  The service here was lovely, but the food was so average that I don't really know what to say.  We had a salad, which was decent, and a cheese pizza that was also decent.  The coal oven does give it a unique flavor, but it wasn't my thing.  Again and again I say, Pino's is the best pizza in town, and everything else just disappoints me.

Man, this place is like something out of a movie, or magazine, or perhaps just real life.  I really love being in their space, and I love that after only three times, Danielle, who took my order, remembers my name, and knew the name of the guy behind me, too.  That sort of personal touch means a lot to me, and despite some of the pretense--like having a DJ on a Friday morning (spinning good tunes, I might add)--it's comfortable and fun.    I like that they serve my Moroccan Mint tea in a cast-iron tea kettle.  I like how they cook all the goodies right there in the same space as the customers, and I like that the people who work there match the style of the space.  Wish they did pour overs and pressed coffee, though.    Their mixed alcoholic drinks have all been excellent, although pricey.  My favorite is the slightly odd margarita they make, and it takes about five minutes to create, so be patient, but it's well worth the time.  Prepared food takes forever, especially if there's a line, so I suggest ordering a pastry behind the glass and a drip coffee if you are in a hurry, but then this isn't Starbucks, so don't come here if you need to rush off.

Okay, I think I was a dick the first time I wrote a review of Matt's, so i'll try again.  I don't like lines.  No, I mean I really don't like lines and I have horrible Disney World nightmares that sometimes wake me up.  Despite my hatred of lines, I love Matt's and I dream of Matt's, too, and sometimes I even find myself in line at Matt's in the blazing heat, waiting for those wonderful pancakes and floating like Bugs Bunny to a carrot.  I think I said something silly in my last review, like, "I won't go back for months because of the lines," but I was back and I felt guilty, so I'm rewriting the review to assuage my guilt and allow me a future guilt-free experience as I devour their pancakes.  I wasn't kidding about the scooter gang, though.  Seriously, there was a scooter gang in line.

The old menu is back!    Many thanks to corporate and to all the other people who either complained or stopped going.  We used to go at least once a week, but the new concept had really turned us off, and I'd say we went a total of 4 times since the switch, half of,those times paid by gift cards from corporate.    No more disposable plates and silverware, but good ole china!  Best of all, I can get my old favorites and a bowl of Lo Mein for my son.    So while the food and restaurant may not actually be five stars, I'm giving it to them for returning the Pei Wei universe to the correct order.  Thanks!

Ate here tonight for the first time and I'm really happy to report that their vegetarian options are plentiful and excellent.  Had the spring rolls, the vermicelli salad, a curried pho, an excellent fruit dessert, and a simple tofu and noodle pho for my son.    update...I've now been several times, and my only complaint is that the food is a bit inconsistent.  It's never bad, and that's a good thing, but sometimes the curried soup is the best ever, and sometimes it's just okay.  Will I stop going here?  No!  Would I recommend it?  Absolutely.  But I would like to see the dishes be a bit more consistent...that's all.

After reading all the great reviews on Yelp and in other places, I came here expecting margaritas that would make my heart sing Spanish love songs, even though I don't know Spanish.  We chose Cinco de Mayo for our visit, since I wanted an excellent margarita, and we both ordered the 6th st. "award-winning" margarita as a starting place.    First, it was tiny.  Second, it had the quality of so many restaurant margaritas, and how else can I describe it other than floor cleaner?  You know, the kind they used to wax the terrazzo floors of your high school cafeteria with.  Tasted like that.  Good margaritas are so easy to make, but almost no one gets them right because they either use crappy bulk mixes or that garbage that comes out of a giant steel container through a gun.  Disappointing.  I was hoping the food would redeem the lousy margarita, but alas, I found no redemption here.  In a word, or three, it was really, really mediocre.  We ordered the chips and salsa, with the three house salsas, and it was decent, but no better than the free stuff you get at most any cheap Mexican restaurant.  Nothing fantastic, but decent.  The cornbread was good, but seemed like a gimmick.  My wife's salad was below average.  Funny, but they mix your salad for you at tableside, which seems odd unless you are at a four-star restaurant from 1980 and they are mixing your Caesar salad in a giant stainless bowl before delivering your Steak Tartare with a side of gout.  I ordered the diablo pasta, thinking it would light my fire and cause me to forget the lousy margarita and order a more expensive one, but el Diablo was nowhere to be found.  Instead, el Diablo sent his less well-known American cousin, Senor Bland.  It wasn't hot in any way, shape or form and in fact didn't taste like anything besides milkfat pretending to be a sauce of some kind.  I ate about three bites and gave up because it was so incredibly tasteless.  The service was good, and I liked both the hostess and our waitress.  I did see a couple at the table next to us walk out because they didn't feel they were being attended to fast enough, but I thought they were just being jerks.    The decor looks as though they bought out one of those stores that sells model home furniture and called it a day, but then most of the houses in Phoenix look like this, so I can't fault them too much for trying to make their clientele feel at home.  This restaurant is mostly for people who want to pretend they like southwestern/Mexican food, but think Chili's is not authentic enough (by the way, Chili's has better margaritas, and that's sad).  Needless to say, I won't be going back.  I can go to the Los Taquitos near my house and eat authentic food and drink a margarita with fresh-squeezed lime juice for half the price, and with way more than twice the taste.

I came to Satara with low expectations because it's in the middle of a lot of crappy chain restaurants, and it's in Peoria.  Never judge a book by what suburb it's located in, or how close it might be to the Cheesecake Factory.    This is the second-best Thai food I've had, and because my #1 is so good, I almost never eat at Thai restaurants anymore because I'm so consistently disappointed.  Satara really raises the bar, and in so many ways.  A Thai restaurant with a great wine list?  Fantastic, and why not?  And when I say second-best, it's like saying Kobe Bryant is the second-best basketball player ever, not a knock on the restaurant.  I look forward to many extraordinary visits to Satara.

Okay, I gave them four stars on my last review, but I simply can't do it again.  It's five-star coffee, through and through.    After sampling their location at Kierland I decided to drive 14 miles and have coffee at their location up north.  I asked what they had in a light to medium roast, and I swear she brought ten bags of coffee for me to sniff.  They roast all of it, and not one bag had even the slightest burnt smell, but overwhelmed me with complex aromas.  Nothing else in Phoenix can compare.    I have now cleaned out our casita and am ready to open up a clandestine and illegal coffee speakeasy in central Phoenix.

I went to Tony's based on the reviews here, and the reviews have it spot on.    I have a ten-year old pair of Italian-made Kenneth Cole's that are the most unique and beautiful shoes I've ever owned, and I literally want to wear them for the rest of my life.  Hell, I want to be buried in these shoes, since all the mourners will be saying, "Damn, that guy had taste."    These beauties have been in need of new soles for about four years now, and I have been reluctant to give them to just anyone, only to see them ruined.  No, I needed a specialist.  I needed the Mayo Clinic for shoes.  I'm proud to say that Tony's is the Mayo Clinic.  I almost cried when I received my shoes back, because they looked better than they did when I bought them.  Not only that, he had them finished the next day.  Last time I had shoes repaired it took nearly a week, and they didn't look half as good.    I also took my wife's Mary Janes in to have a strap replaced and he matched the original perfectly.    I salute you, Tony's, and so do the shoemakers of Italy.

I'll get the drama out of the way now and say, unequivocally, I love, love, love this restaurant.  My wife and I are vegetarian, and it's not only veg-friendly, it's excellent.  Their veggie burger is one of the best I've had in the city, and Dr. Funk may be my favorite drink of all time, with the Scorpion Bowl coming in a close second.  Spicy tofu tacos?  Excellent.  My favorite dish is, by far, the Jungle Tofu bowl, which should always leave me with a to-go box, but is always consumed fully on the premises.  I almost never get dessert anywhere, but their key lime pie is the best I've had since Key West...no kidding.  Parking can be a bit of a bear on the wrong night here, but my favorite time to visit is on a Saturday afternoon when it's almost always quiet and relaxing.  We have an electric car, and their two charging stations are a plus, but at night they are almost always occupied by gas burners.    And before I forget, the staff here has always been lovely, from the hosts, to the bar and wait staff.    As a last word, Hula is my go-to place when I need to relax and forget about my troubles.  They really make me feel like I'm on a tropical island.

I was a little suspicious about the abundance of positive reviews, but these guys are fantastic.  Needed a new windshield quick, and they were able to accomodate me same day at my wife's office.  I know that's not always possible, but they took care of business and I appreciate the extra effort.  The guy at the office was professional and polite, and Freddie, the installer was super-nice guy and did a great job.  I'll definitely use them again next time.

This is bad-burger review night for me, as I crave a big veggie burger, but everything is closed.  I had low opinions of the Habit and their hockey puck veggie burger, and I must sadly report the same of Smashburger.  Just a lump of nothing.  I would rather eat a cardboard container from Burger King than eat another Smashburger veggie burger.  Yuck.    As others have said, the customer service is fine, but I can't eat customer service, and as a vegetarian I can't eat the servers, either, although I'm sure even their uniforms taste better than the veg burger.  God, I really hated that burger, didn't I?  This is another one of these places where I will simply never go again because it was just so bad and bland.    Here's a tip to all restauranteurs: don't put a veggie burger on the menu if you really don't give a shit about veggie burgers or if you simply plan to buy a giant box of a thousand Boca burgers at Costco.  I love Boca burgers in a pinch, at home, and only if slathered in my own BBQ sauce, but not in your damn restaurant.    The only good part about this experience was that they have plenty of parking, and oh, the people who work there are very friendly.  Other than that, yuck.

This is another one of those places that I patronize on a fairly regular basis, but keep forgetting to review, and that's too bad, since this is a great place.  Their food is so good, and so reliably good, that it shouldn't be known as only a wrap restaurant.  I've had several things there, but I get one so often that I've forgotten all the rest.  I love the Thai wrap with the peanut sauce and tofu, with a side of either their excellent soups of the day, or with a side of their excellent pico and chips.  I feel so healthy when I eat here, and i should eat here way more often and lay off the pizza.    The interior of the restaurant is a little tight at lunch, so I recommend the patio if it's open.  I would like to see them in a big airy space, but it's not going to stop me that they are not.    This may sound funny, but I think the presentation of fast food here is the best I've seen for the price.  I like the little containers the food is delivered in, and it always looks so clean and tight, plus the food tastes just as good as it looks.  I really appreciate when people making relatively cheap food make such an effort to make it look good, too.  I would still like coming here if it was sloppy presentation, because it's tasty, but I want the kitchen staff to know that I see their work and that they do an excellent job with aesthetics, as well as taste.      The staff:  always friendly.  It's like they take happy pills.  Maybe they do?  They seem like a family, and that is always lovely.  Also like that they serve beer and wine here, plus Reed's Ginger Ale.  Mmmm, ginger ale.  As a final word: highly recommended.

I moved near Los Taquitos about two months ago, and it's funny that I've yet to write a review, considering I eat here at least three times a week.  I really love all the food here, but my favorite is the cheap veggie burrito.  It's the best damn veggie burrito in my sometimes sketchy memory.  Strange enough, and it's no lie, the second best was in Galway, Ireland.    Margaritas are excellent, and can be had for a mere $3 between 4-7.  Mmmmm.  They squeeze limes and use agave nectar for sweetening.  Very tasty.    Also try their chile rellenos if they happen to be at the bottom of the menu when you visit.  I want to go swimming in the sauce they pour over the chile.  Love the breakfast torta, slathered in a generous pour of the green salsa.  Great pico?  Absolutely.    I can't really write enough nice things about this restaurant, and the fact that you have a 20% chance of seeing me there at any given time should testify to my true love.  My only complaint is the styrofoam cups and plastic plates.  I really hate styrofoam.  Get real plates!!!

I'm really bummed that this place is so far away from my house and that it's located in such a douchebag kind of location.  I don't want to see people dressed in clothes that cost more than my car while enjoying a good cup of coffee, and goddamn they serve good coffee.  I've had so much bad coffee in the valley in my first two months here, at places that call themselves coffee shops with "baristas" who dump foam onto my cappuccino as if they were a lunchlady unloading a particularly glutinous scoop of mashed potatoes onto my tray.  No thanks.  This place is like heaven.  A Chemex pour-over with my favorite Ethiopian coffee?  Oh yes.  I usually have to cover up Phoenix coffee with a thirty second pour of sugar and a half-gallon of cream, but not here.  I drank it black and relished every smooth drop.  The crazy-ass 18-hour iced coffee on the wall?  Pretentious and awesome.  Love it.  Okay, back to the location.  Why, oh why did you put your shop here?  Were there too many shops in cool locations and you decided that a-holes in Lamborghinis needed better coffee than me?  (I'm not exaggerating about a-holes in Lamborghinis, since one of them couldn't stop looking at my wife's boobs the entire time we ate at True Food).    I want you to reconsider your poor choice of locations, with my full forgiveness, and open a shop in my garage.  I won't even charge you rent, just a Chemex pour-over every morning.  At the very least open a shop somewhere in central Phoenix.  I'll work for free.  By the way, the two girls who were working today were awesome.  Five stars for them!!!  Four stars because I'm pissed you aren't closer.

I picked up this deal on Living Social, which was $39 for an exam and glasses, which sounds like a fantastic deal, but it appears that their normal deal is essentially the same, so it was disappointing that I could have walked in and not wasted my time with Living Social.  I'll keep that in mind before I buy another deal from them.    The good:  I really like the Dr. who gave me the exam, and considering this is a franchise, perhaps it belongs to him?  The lady who helped me was nice, but kept trying to push me into more expensive things.  My glasses came back looking nice and polished, and the lenses seem fine.  The bad:  because of the deal the place was pretty packed and they have a goofy system in which you write your info down on a plastic-covered piece of paper with an impermanent marker, which they then erase and reuse for the next customer.  What is this, Soviet Russia?  I was scared to use their bathroom for fear I would only get one square of toilet paper.  I'm all about conservation, but that's ridiculous.  Either get iPads for people to use for this purpose, or use old-fashioned paper!!!  It was silly and hard to use.   Their selection of frames is a confusing mess.  They are all color coded in, I think, four different colors, which match four price points.  They are all cheap, as eyeglass frames go, but the selection was really abominable, especially the frames that went with the $39 deal.  I'm not sure what bargain bin they picked through in 1981, but there are some real gems if you are headed to a costume party and need something to match your leisure suit.  The higher priced frames weren't much better, and I ended up using my old frames because I literally couldn't find one pair I liked at any price point.  Their Dakota line would look great with your Ed Hardy t-shirt collection.  They, of course (like every eyeglass shop), try to push you into getting the non-reflective coating.  I really hate the green cast of the coating, and so I was pretty adamant and they finally relented.  So I really didn't get glasses for $40, and I ended up paying an extra $85 for polycarbonate lenses for my old frames.  Not a bad deal, but not a great deal, but such is the Groupon/Living Social game.  So the verdict is: if you want cheap glasses this is the place for you, especially if you can get away from all the extras (plastic lenses are more scratch resistant than even polycarbonate with a scratch-coating).  I think they must get their frames when other companies go out of business or last year's models, so you might get lucky and get a cool pair, but go and check before getting roped into buying any or getting an exam.  If price is no issue and you want cool glasses, then go to Sassy Glasses on 16th st. and Glendale.  Awesome place that's more like visiting a shop in London or New York.  Eye Stop is right at home in the PV mall.  One more thing: steer clear of this place on a Saturday afternoon since it's when the no-talent show is held right outside their door.  I want to punch all reality show hosts for convincing America's youth that they might have talent.

Are you fucking kidding me?  Can I say fucking in a review?  This place is absolutely incredible, like some kind of mirage in the desert--so good I think it won't be there when I return, or else I'm going to go back and it will be an Italian restaurant like I thought it was the first time.  I saw the reviews before eating there, but I nearly turned around when I looked at the storefront.  My god, what a mistake that would have been.    I ordered every vegetarian item on the menu, like the vegetarian glutton that I am, and as a gift she brought me a bowl of lentil soup, which I consumed so quickly and with so much gusto that she brought me another.  Hummous: fantastic.  Falafel: like I just walked out of a shop in Morocco.  It's crazy good.  On top of that, they are lovely people.  I just moved to Phoenix, but I'll definitely be eating here weekly when we get back from London.

I had high hopes for the Habit since I live only a couple miles away, but it was mostly disappointing for me.  I'm vegetarian, so I have no idea how their meat burgers taste, and they may be the best in the world for all I know, but the veggie burger was a tasteless lump for the most part.  I do give them kudos for having a veggie burger, but either put more effort into it, or take it off the menu and go full-on meat!  The service was nice, and I like the design of the place, but there are too many good veggie burgers to be had in the Valley to waste my time eating this one.  Parking lot is super-cramped, so if you need your meatburger fix, then don't come right at 12 or 6, unless you want to park in someone's yard.

Disinterested front desk staff, and the place is filled with machines and games full of garbage.  I'd say half the floor space here is circulation space and tables, and the other is jump space.  One section costs extra, which is baffling.  This was our first and last time here.  FlipDunk is way better, more interesting, more friendly.

If you have a hankering for pure vegetarian food in Phoenix, then this is probably the default restaurant.  We are all veg in our house, and my son's a picky eater and also a homebody, but he loves to come have their veggie burger and fries.  While I can't name all the dishes I've had there, I can certainly vouch for the BBQ chicken sandwich and burger, and I've only had one dish there that didn't excite me, but that's a pretty good track record considering the number of times we've eaten here.    Love the atmosphere here and enjoy occasionally sitting with people we don't know at the bigger tables.  As others have said, there is very little parking.  We've always been lucky and found a space, but if you can bike here, then I highly recommend doing so (so there is more parking for me).

Lisa is an amazing therapist and a lovely person.  I've been having some chronic back and muscle issues, and plain massage therapy was getting me nowhere, but Lisa is a magician.  I've seen her twice now, and she's done an awesome job finding and alleviating my pain. Highly recommended.

This is the hippest yogurt shop in town, and the only one--that I know of--that doesn't look like it was picked out of a franchise catalog.  I was having afternoon drinks/snacks at Hula and wandered over to see what was happening, since I had seen construction activity on my way to Lux for coffee every morning.  I'm not sure what was here before, but it feels like a modern beach shack, with a big comfy couch, a giant custom table with benches, and a lot of slick reclaimed wood.  I want to come and just hang out here.  The owner said they have free wifi, so I will be back with my ipad.  As for the yogurt, I tried the caramel, and it was as good or better than any yogurt I've had in the valley.  Plus, they are restaurateurs (they run Hula, too), not just douchebag investors looking to make a quick buck (no offense to douchebag investors), so I trust that they give a damn about the quality of everything they serve.  I'm happy to see this place open and I look forward to a long, happy relationship.    There's no sign yet, but it's literally next door to Hula, and right off the street.  Just like Hula, I have access to their car chargers for my Leaf, so yet another bonus.  Only yogurt shop in town with EV charging.

These folks are top-notch.  I had one of my images printed here and then framed, and they did a wonderful job.  Alice, the framer, is a real pro and spent a lot of time with me making sure everything was right, and the final product was spectacular.  I'm very happy with their work and I'll be back.

They never ever ever have enough lanes open here.  Ever.  That's why I almost always drive the extra 3 miles to go to Whole Foods.

They never ever ever have enough lanes open here.  Ever.  It's been true ever since this store opened.  It must be a company policy to hire too few people to service their customers, because it never changes.  I came here out of a food emergency tonight, and as usual, I regretted my decision.  I just don't get it.

I'm really happy to have discovered this place, and can't believe I've missed it.  Food was good, service was friendly and quick, and the sticky rice and mango were very tasty.  It will be a lot easier to reach when the light rail is done, but we went on a Sunday and had no trouble getting in and out.  Had the papaya salad, broccoli and tofu, pad Thai and Thai basil, which I think is sometimes called pad kee mao. Will go back soon!

Great clothes, but awful customer service.  I've been in this store twice and been completely ignored both times.  I appreciate some space when I shop, but not being treated as if I don't exist.  I was one of two people shopping today and no help, not even a hello as I looked 5 feet away from the two girls working the register.    I've been shopping at their Spanish stores since I lived in Granada in early 2000's, but I won't waste my time at this one again.

Hands down, the best food of this kind in the Phoenix metro.  I've been to Europe on many occasions, and no one, I mean no one, beats the croissants here.  I've never had a bad meal here, and I've been many, many times.  Don't waste your time with inferior pastries at trendy places like LGO.

Great food, beautiful building.  I'm a big fan of the Chopshop in Tempe, and I was really excited to find they have a location in Chandler. Downtown here is pretty meaty, and this is an excellent option for vegetarians with the tofu protein bowl and other items.

This place has been a long time coming, and I'm glad to see it's finally open.  We had a quick dinner at the bar last night, and the food is so good that I want to write a quick review.    It's a cool restaurant physically, although the high ceilings kill a bit of the intimacy, and probably costs them a fortune in air conditioning.  We sat at the bar, which is large and comfortable, and ordered our dinner there.    There were a LOT of people working behind the bar.  I didn't count, but it looked like they were tripping over one another.  Our bartender was very nice, even replacing a drink I didn't like that I ordered from the cocktail menu.  But the service isn't completely dialed in at Sumo yet.  For instance, I ordered the FABULOUS mushroom tacos, but a server brought over chicken tacos.  I told him it was wrong, and instead of taking them back to the kitchen, he got in a bit of an argument with our bartender, and our bartender showed him our ticket twice because he seemed to want someone to blame.  It was an unnecessary conversation in front of a guest, and he should've simply apologized and brought the right dish.  This was all on the server, not our bartender.    Every food item we ordered was splendid.  I had the tacos, my wife ordered the Kimchi fried rice, and we had the traditional guac.  We ordered some garbanzo beans, too, but somehow they didn't get into the computer, but we didn't finish the guac, so it was no huge loss.  We are vegetarians, and we were very happy with the wide variety offered to veggie customers.  My only complaint is that you get a ton of guac and too little of the bread for dipping, which is another $1.  I can afford another dollar, but it seems cheap on the restaurant's part, but that's a small complaint for what was a great meal.  For drinks I ordered the top two items on the cocktail menu: a five spice rum drink and a coconut drink.  I didn't find either remarkable, but I'm willing to keep going down the menu on future visits.   The crowd is pretty typical Scottsdale, which is generally a turnoff for me and I tend to stay on my home turf in central Phoenix, but I'll venture down Lincoln Rd and sneak in again soon.

Grilled vegetable and hummus burrito is delicious.  Really a unique burrito you won't find anywhere else.  The vegetables are perfectly grilled with a delicate smoky flavor and has a bit of cabbage inside which gives it a great tang.   Can't wait to come back.  A new, instant favorite.

So I'm basing my review on one interaction and one cappuccino, but some places you know will do everything else right if they care so much about one cup.  First, the spot is lovely and they've done a great job on the interior.  Second, and more importantly, the baristas love and care about coffee.  Spencer and Lisa were great, and I enjoyed chatting with them about our favorite coffee spots.  My only complaint is that their shop isn't near my house in central Phoenix (expansion?).
