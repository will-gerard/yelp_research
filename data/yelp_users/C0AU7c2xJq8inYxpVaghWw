I love this place!  Great food, great micro-brews (that you can even take home), great atmosphere.   I love dining outdoors, and the place stays comfortable in the winter with outdoor heaters and the summer with misters.   I take all my out of town guests here as well as I know there will be something on the menu for everyone and the food will always be delicious and of the highest quality.  Friendly staff as well.

I love this place!  The food is fantastic and very reasonably priced, the staff is amazing with great customer service, and they have great beers on tap as well as a nice selection of wine.   The interior is comfortable with large farm style tables for groups.    I frequent this place at least once a week - it is that good!

Although the staff is friendly, and the interior looked promising, as did the crowd, this brewery could do with a decent Chef to create tastier food.   The micro-brews were so-so.    Four Peaks wins by miles and miles.

This Salon is absolutely the best in town. Babak is amazingly talented stylist.  He knows what color, cut and style will best suit your face.  I always look fabulous when I step out of his Salon and now see him every week so that I always look my best.  Whenever I walk in, the person walking out looks gorgeous as well. And he doesn't just make women look stunning.  Guys, if you want to look like a rock star, go see Babak.

The food is not only healthy, but flavorful.  If you want to make healthy choices in your life, start here.  I typically order one of the salads and have them swap out the shrimp for chicken.  The avocado dressing is amazingly flavorful.  I also like their juices and find them unique in that the few I have had are a bit tart.   The prices are fantastic ($10 for a healthy, nicely portioned salad with protein) and the staff friendly.
