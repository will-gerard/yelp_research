I'm not kidding you this place sucks so bad I wish I had 1.5 years of my life back. If you're looking at this place, I'll save you some trouble and let you know to just go live at the San Marin or San tropez, or hell, even a street corner.   The palladium REEKS of garbage 24/7. And  I'm not exaggerating, it's a known thing in Scottsdale that the place smells like rotting dead animals all the time. And it's so surprising too because they have a valet trash service that costs you an extra 35 dollars a month that you can't get out of! Like I think they must be just picking up the trash from your front door and stock piling it in their office.   Also,  not one front office person still works there from when I started. This isn't a bad thing, cause sometimes they're nice, but clearly alliance has some issues with property management that need to be sorted out. The turnover rate here is higher than a telemarketing call center.   Ok. What else. The apartments themselves are ok, but for the price you'd think you'd be living in a penthouse in NYC. They say you "pay for location" but last time I checked more people want to move out of Scottsdale than into it.   I move out in 3 days (THANK god) and I'm sure I'll be hit with numerous charges here and there because I've also heard horror stories from all my friends who (unfortunately) lived here too.   OH and one last thing. No one wants to go to your stupid pool parties, Palladium! Stop using our rent money to throw "events" that include 5 front office members sitting around a table of diet coke and chips at our already deserted pool.   Pros: dog friendly, the matinence guys are nice, parking is easy if you have 1 car (if you have more than 1 you'll be looking at like an extra 200 a month), and it's close to old town so you can drink away the pain from the fact you live at the palladium   Cons: everything else

A fine dining establishment. Reccomend the blue powerade slushie.  It is an international delight.

I should probably start this review off by saying that I love my dog, Morrison. I love him so much that I would  probably marry him if I could. When I die, he's getting most of the money I have (aka not much, but I'm sure he'll enjoy it). IN FACT there isn't one person I meet that I don't' show a picture of him too because I love his face so much I want to take it and put it in a display case in my room.   Anyway, I digress. I boarded Morrison here for 10 days when I went abroad to Europe. Talk about being worried, I wasn't just out of town, but in another country. But I was really pleased when I got a couple emails throughout my time in Europe. One of them saying he was doing great, and another asking if they could give him some medicine for his allergies. Talk about keeping the parent informed! My biggest pet peeve with vets/groomers/doggiedaycare/or any pet related business, is when they try and hide injuries, medicine, or anything else  from the owner because they think it will be OK in the end. Partners wouldn't do that.   Usually when Morrison comes home from overnight doggie day care he is a little on edge and might growl at people for the next 24 hours. This wasn't the case at all here. He actually seemed like his normal happy self.   The training part of the day care went great too. This is a relatively in-expensive place to train your dog especially if you combine it with doggie day care. I am too obsessed with Morrison to even try and train him (I just CAN'T scold him). But after a few days here, he could sit, walk better on a leash, and even understand when I told him NO). They train bomb dogs, police dogs, and other dogs of the sort here, so you know they know what they're doing.   The facility was always clean when I saw it, which I know at other places I've been too there is poop and pee everywhere, so it was nice to see none of that. It even smelled OK too. As for the staff, they seemed to know what they were doing. All of them that I talked to had dogs of their own, sometimes they even make appearances at the office. There is an adorable great dane that sits in front.   I might be missing something, but I think I covered it all. Long story short, great facility and a place you can trust your children (oops, I mean pet).

I love the concept of this place. Pick and choose what you want for your mani or pedi. An up scale chipotle of nail salons (maybe that's not the best analogy but oh well).   Besides a great color selection  and a cool atmosphere, what really gives this place 5 stars is the owner. Just take a look at how she responds to not so nice reviews on Yelp, it's amazing to finally see some real and genuine customer service. Even just talking to her in person you can hear the passion she has about her business. Here's to hoping she opens some more stores. I bet this place would do amazing in other cities!

I've been waiting for the day that I could write a review on MIC and finally the time as come. I love Madison Improvement Club so much that I wish I could pay rent and live in it for my entire life.  I have done yoga since highschool and attended various workout classes and gyms but this is hands down the BEST run studio of all time. Not only are the teachers amazing and the staff is super nice, but finally there is a workout studio that is big enough to walk around in and not bump shoulders with the sweaty masses. They have ample lockers and cubbys to put your stuff in. It's also spotless and I always see someone come in after class and clean the yoga floor and the bike seats. And I think the best thought out feature is the fact that both the yoga room and the spin room open up to the outside. Like the whole wall can just open up so after class you can cool off with real outside air! And it doesn't get stuffy at all in the rooms.   They literally have everything here, which is good because I seem to always be forgetting my water bottle, shoes, you name it and I've probably left it at home.  They've got towels, ice cold water, rental mats, rental spin shoes, and the girls locker room has shampoo, conditioner, body wash, face wash, and a bevy of hair products! I know this stuff is typical of a big gym, but this is just a small local studio for classes. All you need to bring to your workout is yourself. The gear they sell is actually pretty cute too, lots of LuLu and other popular workout brands.   Anyway, I used to hate spin. It was boring sitting on a bike and it hurt, but I've seriously never had more fun than at this class. I would rather spend a night at one of these spin classes than at Smashboxxx (but I would also rather spend a night in jail than at Smashboxxx so I guess that was a bad comparison). I like Andrew V's classes because I'm partial to the music he plays. It's alot of cool electronic remixes to popular songs. And if I'm doing Yoga, I like Alex Austins class. It's really high energy and he's so positive.  I've gotten at least 10 friends to come with me on numerous occasions and a few of them now belong and are regulars with me. The only thing that is a bummer is the price, but I think it's pretty comparable to other classes out there and it's worth it anyway.   And don't even get me started on S.E.E.D Cafe. My entire paycheck would go to buying sandwhiches, salads, and juices from there if it could.  So THANK YOU to whoever the owner is for turning whatever that building was into this awesome place.
