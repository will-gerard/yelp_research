Phucking Phoenix does it again. TSA is off on break, line about 75 people deep and 1 guy checking ID's. I'd rather take my chances with the terrorist than put up this level of coverage.

Fresh sushi, fresh air!  The waiter was a little meek about taking our order even saying the bottle of sake was "Very Expensive!"  After ordering over $100 worth of sushi, the chef came out from behind the bar and asked "What brings you to my sexy sushi bar?!"  We told him he had great reviews and ratings on YELP!  He asked if we were still hungry and I gave a resounding "yes!"  He then asks "Would you like to try my SEXY TUNA?" while doing a hip shake to emphasize sexy tuna. "ummm YES!" Best spicy tuna I've ever had.
