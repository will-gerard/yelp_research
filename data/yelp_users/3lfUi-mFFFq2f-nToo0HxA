I live nearby and probably order from here at least two or three times a month. I usually pick up my order and order online. I have never had a negative experience and have actually had great customer service every time. Maybe they have made some changes as I see others have not had as much luck. Either that or we reap what we sew I suppose...

This is one of my favorite hangouts. The staff is always friendly and have great memories and social skills. It is nice to always be greater with a smile and warm greeting no matter who is working. This coffee shop has amazing pastries made from scratch daily with a good variety. I have never had a problem finding an available outlet, which is pretty rare in a coffee house so centrally located and that does good business. You wont be disappointed. Cute and has a lot of character!

Was excited to find out it was open later than 10 so I could go with my friends after dinner. The two younger employees were surprisingly helpful and friendly even though it was almost closing time and they didn't make us feel rushed at all. It was great all around!

Couldn't have been a better experience. I will and have recommended this location to many friends and family. Tom was especially helpful and made what would be a negative experience so much better. I went to him for a second opinion and got much more done for significantly less! The other shop was trying to take advantage of me and it might have worked had it not been for meeting with Tom. He even checked my spare which was flat and I had no idea. One month later I had to use that spare on the side of the highway and was on my way in 20 minutes as opposed to hours waiting for AAA as I was in the middle of nowhere. What a life saver!!!

I do not usually tan, but I bought a tanning package through Groupon for a wedding. I was surprised by how many options for beds they have given they are not only a tanning salon. The beds are great and so is the well informed staff!

Came here for my partner's birthday/our anniversary. Rachel was such an awesome server and their happy hour was so great. The bartender was very friendly and creative as well. We will certainly be returning!

I am not a fan of their billing practices. I thought it was great that I could put a hold on my account for $5 and not have to pay the monthly fee (which is too high in my opinion since I now pay $15 less a month elsewhere), but was charged the full price anyway after I was told I wouldn't be.When I called the day my card was charged and asked why, I was told I had not signed a paper stating that I wanted to put my account on hold. How was I supposed to know I had to sign something if I was never told??? When I said I wanted a hold for the next month, he said that was fine and he would make a note of it. Where is this paper I am supposed to sign? It was obviously his mistake, but he would not own up to it and give me a refund. I was given to run around a lot. I was told a few times I would have my call returned and never did. He stopped answering when I called all together, but when I called from a different number right afterward, my call was answered right away. SHADEY! I was offered a credit by the owner but never took him up on it. Instead, I canceled my card so they would stop charging me since I no longer trusted him to do as he said. The male owner and his partner are very chatty, but gossipy and told me information about other members I felt was inappropriate (names, where they worked, etc). Very unprofessional and bad businessman.

Was told I could transfer my prepaid waxes to other people and come to find out you can't. Wouldn't have purchased if this was the case so sucks to be lied to just to make a sale. Never had a problem before this so was shocked.

Such great service! My girlfriend and I were very happy with the results of our eyebrow wax and pedicures. They took their time and were very friendly. The patience of the staff was tested by a rude returning customer that was loud and demanding. They still treated her with kindness despite her attitude and she soon calmed down. Very classy and well done!
