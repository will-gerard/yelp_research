Great gym! Super clean, great locker rooms and the pools are phenomenal. I wish it didn't get so busy in the free weight and stretching areas around 3:30/4pm but that's to be expected for any gym with after work crowds. Definitely recommend it to anyone gym shopping. Great classes too!

FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!   Obviously you can't go wrong with their food, that's definitely never the issue. My boyfriend and I LOVE this place and have only been disappointed with their food once.  I usually have OK service (have never had great customer service here) but the last time I visited I was sooooo disappointed.   We only get a 30min lunch break at my job, so we are always looking for places that will allow us to order take-out. Two weeks ago it was my friend's last day, and we wanted to go out to lunch as a group to wish her well and to spend time away from the office for lunch. My co-worker called this location a couple hours before we planned to eat to see if we could place our order ahead of time, but eat there and order drinks with a server. (We obviously planned to tip the server for our food purchase as well) Even though the girl said that would be fine over the phone, it was a nightmare when we got there.   We were scolded by some blonde woman (I'm assuming a manager?) because they "don't normally do this", even though we were ok'd by the girl who took our orders over the phone. Everyone treated us terribly as if we were being high maintenance, even though we were advised by the staff that this would be ok. We were not trying to make trouble for anyone, and were treated poorly because of the new girl's mistake. Not to mention she tried to close us out ahead of time, even though the bartender advised her that she should not "close us out"; to which she said "I'm not closing them out, I'm having them pay for it." (Clearly she was brand new to the industry).  5 stars for food but the service at this location is terribleeeee! Such a shame.

Amaaaaaaaaazing.  They have some of the best Thai food in the valley, fosho. (And I'm a Thai food junkie)  Unfortunately they don't deliver, but it's worth the extra time to pick up for take-out. :)  Highly recommend!

Super disappointed with my coffee today. And honestly I wouldn't continue to get my morning coffee at this location if there was another McDs on my route to work. I always ask for extra ice because their "iced" coffee is too hot if I don't. This morning was especially bad, because the coffee tastes sour, and not only did they not give me the extra ice that I ordered, it's so watered down that I can't taste the coffee at all. After all of the terrible coffees I've had here, and this morning, I won't be back.

Absolutely terrible dog boarding. They quoted me one price over the phone and when my boyfriend went to pick up my two dogs, it was $20 more (which actually would have been $50.00+ more but the girl at the front claimed she waved a "check out fee", and that we actually got their "discounted" rate). Interesting because they never disclosed a check out fee when I booked the boarding.   In addition to them charging more than was agreed, the place smells like dog urine and is filthy. And they didn't give my boyfriend the dog's belongings that we checked in with them, so he had to drive all the way back there to pick them up. It is literally the most unsanitary boarding I've ever seen. I'm never boarding here again and I definitely would caution anyone to steer clear despite their "inexpensive" pricing. They also have false advertising on their website, as they raised their prices to $24/night for dog 1 and not $19.95. Honestly I would not be so pissed about the extra money if the place was decent and they told me the correct price from the beginning. Pay more money and board your dogs at a nicer place because Preppy Pet Tempe was awful.

The advisor I worked with, Andy, was amazing. I've had a horrible car buying experience from Beemer Haus in Scottsdale, so I took my 328i into Chapman for a full diagnostic/second opinion.  Everyone there was so sympathetic to my situation and genuinely cared that I was upset. After running the full diagnostic and telling me what was wrong with my car, Andy spent additional time with me discussing my car's worth/the options I had for an extended warranty, since I was wrongly treated at Beemer Haus.   Andy really cared and I could see he wished he could have helped me more. Thanks so much for being great to work with! You've earned my future business for sure.

I'm extremely surprised this shop has such great reviews, as my experience was literally the opposite. Long story short, they were a nightmare to get ahold of, I left voice mails for the tech that was handling my case, Alberto, that did not get returned. I would ask for updates and never hear back; had to continuously be the one to initiate correspondence, etc.   In addition, I was informed my car was finished two separate times, only to be told something came up LAST MINUTE. The second time I was told it actually wasn't ready for pick up and "something came up", I expressed my concern to Alberto and asked if my car was being handled correctly. He responded, essentially stating my car was being handled well.  That email was nice and reassuring, until I went to pick up my car the next day.  I show up, super excited to get my car after a month of being in the shop, to a HUGE crack in my windshield that WAS NOT THERE when I entrusted Gerber with my car. My accident was rough, and there was a lot of damage to the front end, but absolutely nothing was wrong with my windshield upon drop off at Gerber, and I have photos to prove it.   The tech that took me out to inspect my car initially said that they would replace the windshield because the "original" photos of my car did not show any crack, and that they obviously were at fault. I say thank you, he goes back in to finish up, and then comes back out stating that Alberto wants to talk to me about the windshield. He brings up photos that were "the original photos" they took 4 DAYS AFTER I dropped my car off, showing the huge crack in the windshield. Because of this, he said I had to go through my insurance and make a glass claim, and refused to take responsibility for the crack. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? Here's what is wrong with that:  1) If this was in fact true, and the crack was there when I dropped off my car, that should have been included in my claim. Gerber should have included that in their estimate. My insurance provider should have been made away of the crack FROM DAY ONE. It was their job as a collision repair shop to document that there was a crack, and to go through my insurance to sort that out.  2) My car was there for a month. In all of that time, not once was the crack mentioned to me OR my insurance provider. As they were tearing apart my car and putting it back again, no one thought the crack MIGHT be an issue? What a joke. Alberto claimed Gerber was taking such good care of my car, and that's why my car was delayed TWICE; because they noticed things that were not upto par and "wanted me to be happy with their service".   In the end, I had to contact my insurance provider and battle with them over who would pay for the windshield. I did not care who paid, or how, this was going to be taken care of, but I was not about to let Gerber Collision force me to pay a huge deductible AGAIN for something that was THEIR FAULT. Luckily, Esurance took the hit and paid to get the windshield replaced for me, as they knew Gerber was in the wrong and my insurance adjuster wanted to be sure I was taken care of.   Alas, I will be telling my story all over social media, advising people to stay away from this shop. It was the worst car repair experience I've ever had.

DO NOT LIVE HERE.   I can't even begin to describe my extremely unpleasant experience of 3 years living at Solara. Between the AWFUL leasing office, the lack of safety in the complex, theft, and amount of crime committed here, I tell you do not be tempted by the included utilities. It's not even close to worth the bullsh*t you go through living here.  In fact about two weeks ago I found a loaded GUN stashed under a bush right by my apartment. Apparently there was an armed robbery in the area and the guy either lives in this complex or his accomplice does, and neither is a good option. After calling the police, who had been here patrolling the complex all day, 4 officers showed up and came to talk to me about what happened. I expained the situation, and how upset I was about living at Solara because things like this happen ALL THE TIME. The officer then proceeded to tell me that there are in fact two cops that are assigned to Solara because they are called AT LEAST a few times a week....  WHAT!? There are police officers assigned to this complex because it is so unsafe. And they market this complex as a gated community. HA! That's funny because the gates have been broken on and off (mostly off) since I moved here in Sept. 2012 and there isn't even a gate code. It's fake...there's no gated community and nothing preventing criminals from getting in. Obviously.  And unfortunately that is just one situation I've been in. I've also had an attempted break in of my apartment; shattered a window while I was on vacation. Thankfully they couldn't fit in with the way they broke the window.  I've had THOUSANDS of dollars stolen from the laundromat located by the leasing office. (Which they literally did nothing about)  And have fun paying $1.25 for a wash and $1.25 for a dry that doesn't actually dry your clothes. You'll have to it twice if you have a normal sized load of laundry. And if you ever need to load money on your card, which you will need to do frequently, you have to pay with $5 or $10 or $20 bills for cash (if it is a perfect bill it might accept it) and the minimum the CC machine takes is $20. And they use an off-location vendor for their laundry, so if the signal is down, good luck getting your clothes washed.  The leasing office has lost rent checks that myself and every one of my roommates has turned in, trying to blame it on us for not paying on time when it was their idiocy, not ours. They charged me on a month-to-month basis after one roommate moved out/another moved in because the new girl at the office did not tell us we needed to sign a certain form. Over a month went by and no one contacted us to let us know that a form was forgotten. Instead they blamed it on us, and made us pay 3x what our rent should have been for that month.  Oh, and have fun getting an updated unit with decent appliances. Even if they tell you everything will be brand new, don't trust them. They will say anything to get you to sign.  Even if you put in a work order complaining that your gas stove continuously goes out while mid cooking, they will not replace it. Even if your fridge shelves keep breaking and you have no room for storage, they won't replace it.  If your cabinets are peeling and the droors fall out if you pull them out to far, they don't give a flying you know what.   I hate that this was the experience I had at my first apartment living on my own, and I really REALLY hope this makes you think twice about living here. Because the price that you sign with might be ok now, but it will go up, and the safety issues are not worth it.

Update for anyone who is STILL thinking about moving here after reading all of these terrible, and unfortunately truthful, reviews:  Not only have I had an AWFUL experience living here, but they are crooks as well.  My old roommate and I received their itemized bill in the mail for the "move-out" fees, for over $500 of false charges. They did not credit us for $175 of the deposit that I paid when I first moved there 09/01/2012, and even though I paid over $300 worth of additional deposits for my pet, they sent myself and my old roommate to collections. I requested a meeting with the Maintenance Supervisor when I first received the bill and was denied, and my emails have been ignored (from both Solara At Mill Avenue AND the property management company Holland Partner Group).  We have been forced to seek legal action and are escalating this to our attorney because they sent us to collections over FALSE CHARGES.   DO NOT put yourself through this. Live anywhere else but here. It has been Hell dealing with these incompetent, rude and unlawful people.

Yet, another update. Even though I've advised Solara and the collections agency to cease collections over the fraudulent charges, I am still getting hassled and it is still negatively affecting my credit score.   After reading recent reviews I'm finding they do this to all their tenants. Do. Not. Move. Here.
