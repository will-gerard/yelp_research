Awesome wash, amazing service, locally owned and operated. Generations of my family have been coming to this wash. Definitely the best in town. Reasonably priced, attention to detail. Absolutely no complaints!

If I could give less than one star I would. First off I was in the place for over 2 hours and waited to be seated for over 10 minutes. When we were seated service was lagging but expected being as management obviously did not schedule enough servers for the night. We spoke with the couple next to us the urged us to leave being that service was terribly and slow. We waited and sat it out due to the amazing specials finally we were approached and our first order was taken. After our order was taken everything was TERRIBLE. No one at out table ate their order, and only 3 out of 5 plates were complimented for the check.  I think the manager took us to be young and stupid and did not take us seriously (although I'm sure we have higher credit scores and income than he). I can guarantee you a group of ASU students have a lot of power and influence and that I will never be back.   Tables throughout were left dirty and disgusting. Let me stress I WILL NEVER BE BACK. I. WILL. NEVER. BE. BACK.   I accept that the manger rudely declined my offer to speak with him (probably because we were young). This was rude and ridiculous. I will be calling in the morning. I am done with Macaroni Grill, as long as everyone in our party.   Thanks for nothing and for charging us. You should close this location or fire the managment team. They're doing nothing but losing money.

Where do I start? Well first of all the website says 2 dollar PBR's. That's a no go. 2 dollar bowling, cool, whatever. Not that I can't afford my beers it's cool I don't mind paying. But obviously you're not too concerned about your online presence. Then as we're sitting the "manager" comes over and tells us that she's closing early. Must be nice to be able to leave work when you feel like it. Maybe make a disclaimer on your site.. Oh wait... Maybe you're closing early because there's only 3 lanes playing? Maybe you're closing early because you scare people away by saying your closing? Probably the latter. Well anyways thanks for scaring us away!! We won't be back.

One of my favorite local eateries in town.   The atmosphere is fantastic, the food is divine, and the servers always take excellent care of you. There is not one person I know that has not been made aware of the great food and service at Malee's. By far the best Thai food in town!

What an awesome experience. Had such a wonderful dinner tonight here. Had a minor incident (really was not a big deal!) and all night we were joking with the server about it because we thought it was the funniest thing. At some point he must have relayed this to the manager (it really was not a big deal at all!!) who walked over and comped our entire meal. In turn we left a huge tip to the server because he worked hard and deserved it. Thank you to the female manager that was on duty tonight, you went above and beyond the call of duty. Your kindness was uncalled for and you really went the extra mile to take care of us. It really was not necessary but still very much appreciated.!! This is the kind of positive experience you never forget. We will continue to visit!

The new roof too is beautiful, limited bar, and only one bartender which made for slower service, but it was a good starter for the night. Drinks were very pricey, I left with a 100$ tab. Will go back just gotta drink less next time. Gorgeous views, laid back, and fun. Wish there was louder popular music. Could be good with a few tweaks :)

I am a sucker for good Thai food, and let me tell you this is GREAT Thai food. The service was great, the pad see ew amazing, and the Thai tea was perfection. If you want an authentic Thai meal in the valley, this is the place to be.   p.s. I want those wood Buddha wall hangings :)

Managements poor planning makes for an unpleasant experience. Waited 30 min to be seated which is typical for breakfast on a Friday morning, but waiting 45 min after we order for our food to come out is absurd. The managers have no clue what is going on, probably hired with no skill, no know-how on scheduling, estimating traffic, or management skills. Second time being here and I will never be back. Stick to local places where they still care.

So the food was decent, the service was absolutely terrible and I was charged for a soda when all I got was carbonated water... I asked why and the poor waiter said that when they don't charge for it, the owner takes it out of their check.. Are you kidding me? Not like I needed 2 dollars, and not like it was a big deal but it was when the waiter told me about the owner. I will never be back and don't recommend. It looks like they are struggling anyways so good luck attempting to obtain clients with the way you practice  your business and treat your employees. If you are the owner, and you want to reach out to me and talk about it let me know. I'd love to give you a piece of my mind.

Service can be a little slow at times, no service to tables, must walk up to the bar to get a drink. Didn't expect this with it being a small bar hit but that's fine! I love the vibe of this place. Only reason for 4 stars is because there was no server! Love it otherwise!

Gallo is one of my favorite Taquerias in Phoenix. This and Taco Guild give each other a run for the money. I love everything about gallo, the atmosphere, the service, and the food. Have a bite to eat and a delicious drink and head up to the rooftop bar on a Weekend!

Jon was amazing, I do not have enough words to describe the amazing massage experience I had with Jon. This was by far the best massage experience I have ever had, and I will be returning. Jon is professional, does fantastic work, is personable, and has amazing prices that are worth every penny and then some! I will always support local business until the very end, and that's why I found Jon on Yelp and went to him. I will making another appointment in the next few weeks, I've never been so refreshed. If you ever need a massage in the East Valley call Jon! He also travels! Spread the word, support local, and give Jon a call!!

Haily kicks ass! Sat down at the bar for the first time ever here and she was instantly attentive to us! Fast service and awesome to talk to. She was managing the patio and the bar and rocking it. Super easy to talk to a fun! Never a dull moment and never an empty drink. I would definitely come back to see Haily just wish there was more of a liquor selection. Haily rocks!

Lived here for a year, and it was by far the most amazing apartment living that is available. The staff is amazing, the apartments clean. Everything is cut and dry, no guessing, and you're never left with any concerns. Every issue you have is addressed immediately and everyone always has the will to help, want to know, and sense of urgency that I look for with every company. Mark Taylor is doing something right! Keep it up!  P.S Stacey Welch is by far the most helpful person in the office. Always ready to help and assist in whatever ways possible!! Cant say enough kind words about her!!

The hostesses were quite rude and acted a bit to good for their job, the server was great but I found a hair on my plate. Definitely going to give it a second try. They took great care of me. I recommend the breakfast burger!

The Vig never disappoints. I love that I can get a good glass of wine and have an amazing DJ on a Friday night without being in club environment! Central to all of the 16th & Bethany bars this is always my first stop for some grub. I love love love this place. I can't stay away!

The Mexican style wrap was prepared and displayed well and it tasted fantastic. They're gravy is delicious, coffee mediocre, but drinkable and the waitress had to be the nicest most comical person I've ever been in contact with at a restaurant. Next time I'll try the chicken and waffles, the waitress took us on a "visual journey" to see them and ended the conversation with, "they taste so good make you want to slap yo mama!"

One of my favorite burger joints in the valley. Love the vibe that I get when I walk into this place, the great service and the wonderful selection of beers. FINALLY got my first pumpkin beer of the season being that everyone has been out!! I have been here several times and bring someone new every time. I will continue to come back and support this lovely, laid back, local eatery. Keep doing what you're doing Rehab, you guys are amazing!!

My first review about this company was not a very good one, but due to fact that the owner has reached out to me and made an honest effort to correct the issues at hand I am taking my review down in good-faith and replacing it with this one. I'm have high hopes that from here on out things will remain high level, and that someone will show up on their target dates. We have had no other issues with E&E thus far and I expect it to remain that way.

Service was lacking, food was microwaved, and the employees are too good to he here. Starting with this host just stared at us as we walked in because she must have been too busy standing trying to look hot. Then we get our server, who checked on us twice during the whole time. The runner from the kitchen had to end up taking my order for a drink because Katie R was too busy talking up the hostess. During this time I saw the other waitress check on her table 3 times. Country fried steak was disgusting and dry, English muffin was cold. I have been here several times but this is the last, unfortunately. Management had failed to see any Yelps as I can tell. The internet is the forefront of your business, check local sources and maybe you wouldn't keep running into these same issues.

Tried this for the first time today with my room mate. I insisted on Burger King, and thank goodness we didn't go there! This place is authentic, tasty, cheap and filling. I'm currently rolling around in bed making whale noises because I cannot believe how much middle eastern food I just consumed. I will definitely recommend and tell all my middle eastern cuisine loving college student friends that this is the spot!!

Haven't had time to write a dazzling 5 start review of this place yet but after my delicious hummus plate, I figured I may as well. Every time I walk into this place I am greeted by smiling face that seem genuinely happy to be at their job. The owner is always around and is also very pleasant. This is one of the cleanest places I have ever eaten, you can tell the employees and owner take great pride in their appearance because this place is sparkling. The food is delicious, the BEST Greek in Tempe. GO FOR THE JALAPEÑO HUMMUS, you'll never go back to pita jungle.

Thank you cobblestone for allowing to waste my time and money with your company. I shouldn't have to come home and clean the hard water, bugs, and dirt off of my car. I expect from a full service car wash that I paid 30 dollars for I wouldn't have to do so. From the terrible job you guys did last time to this terrible job, you have secured my decision to never use you again. Maybe if you managers weren't so worried about looking like a badass with their super cool sunglasses and tattoos up their necks we could get something accomplished. Thanks again cobblestone!

Just because you have morons trying to blame their infidelities on you I will update this to 5 stars. Because I have never had panties places in my car and white residue on my dash. You guys do a wonderful job.

Where to start...   Well first off we decided to come to Bevvy for Preakness after first coming for the Kentucky Derby. We thought hey this is a super cool place looks like it has changed a lot from the previous owners. But oh boy were we proven wrong by the servers and the "managing partner".  The story is we had arrived at Bevvy today at around 11am, the races didn't start for a few hours. We had reserved a table which we were well aware was going to be $300 when we had reserved it, that's not the issue. When we arrived everyone was scrambling to figure out what table we belonged at. So we finally get a table and sit down, once we get that table, sit and order our food and drinks, we're moved within 20 minutes. Lovely. This is just the beginning of a wonderful experience.. At this point I can tell.   So after this we get out unlimited mimosas, and we order a second round of food for the other half of the table. At this point we are an hour in and the bottle of premium liquor that we were promised still has not shown up..So we wait patiently and the second half of the table gets there food within minutes, the first half has been waiting for about an hour now. No one knows that we have been waiting, and the waitress does not care. It took another waitress coming up to us asking if we needed anything to figure out that we were missing half a table of food. This is still after several people tried to walk up and serve us the wrong plates.   Once we had gotten that all was fine, it started getting busy, we are full and just getting drinks. So 3pm rolls around and we are told the unlimited mimosas are done. That's fine, the races are going to start and we are ready to head out. That's when the server walks up and says, "So there is a $300 minimum on a table..." Oh... Okay.. we didn't realize that and this was because the "managing partner" did not communicate that.. Probably because it was so formal and mostly over text message (sarcasm). So at this point we have not received $300 worth of food or service and we refuse to pay this. At this point the server is so rude and short with us (although we disclosed that we would take care of her because it wasn't her fault.).   We ended up leaving a $65 dollar tab on a $100 dollar bill. She told us we had to immediately leave because we didn't pay for the table. As I walk away I look around and see other tables paying their $30 tabs between 6 different cards and apparently that is just fine. Well that's wonderful, I'll let  everyone know not to head over to Bevvy because apparently table minimum is $300.. Well for us I guess.. We were the lucky ones that were the exception because we had chosen to reserve a table. Like I said $300, not a big deal.. But I expect $300 worth of service and to be told that my table did not have a bottle. In the end we had gotten the minimum waived, and to be greeted, moving forward, by the snarkiest, most rude server.   All-in-all I see that although this place has changed ownership it has not changed it's employees or management which was about %85 of the previous problem and why derby no longer stands to exist. I hope that something is done about your rude, ignorant, and predatory staff because I for one will not be back and I will be sure to let anyone I know going to old town to avoid this place like the plague.   You have minimal reviews on this place and it is going to look like derby did in a few months if it continues. Good concept, could be amazing if the management actually cared.   Avoid this place.
