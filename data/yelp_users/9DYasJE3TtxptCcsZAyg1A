After 6-7 washes this year they tell me my truck is too big to send through the wash. Its not like my truck has gotten any bigger over the last few months... I get the same BS everytime I go. "Your truck is too big" So,they measure the tires and it's all good, but always a hassle. I stopped going because they try to scam me for an EXTRA $25 dollars to wash my F150... Enough is enough.. I'll take it somewhere else..

I have been going here for 15 years. I think it's great how they evolved from a small tailor shop to a mid sized men's store that offers something for everyone. It really has the look and feel of a fine department store.

This auto spa us conveniently located at the 51 and bell rd. Out of all the washes I've tried this one will accept larger trucks with oversized wheels for the same price as a car. Attention to detail is pretty good. My vehicle is always clean inside and out. The other thing I like is they do oil and tire rotation for a reasonable amount of money.

After 14 years of taking my clothing here I am starting to notice a trend that's brought much unhappiness.  For the past few months, Pat's on greenway and Tatum have ruined a few articles of clothing. The first was a new white shirt that had come back with black grease all over the bottom of the shirt. Its the kind of grease that looks like the stuff you would use on a machine to lube the working parts. The second garment was a Tommy Bahama silk shirt. Again with the grease, but this time large bleach spots all over  the back. Lastly, a few if my wife's dresses... bleach spots all over. I really wish this cleaner would figure out their issues or else I need to go somewhere else.

Dunkin Donuts s at the top of my list for an every day cup of coffee to start the day. As a kid I can remember my grandfather taking me to Dunkin Donuts to get a couple of dozen donuts for the family. Times have changed, and Dunkin Donuts now offers a variety of different breakfast sandwiches and wraps. One of my favorites is the good morning rap. It's pita style bread with egg and your choice of meat. Dunkin Donuts is also a great value unlike some of the other coffee houses in the neighborhood.

This is one of the few shops in the valley that are truly  customer focused. The team  they have assembled at  North Valley Honda are simply the best. What I like best about the shop is that their staff are very knowledgeable. They don't make up stuff to just sell you something and get rid of you. If the person you're working with doesn't have the answer they will  find somebody in the shop that does. Levi is one of my favorite people to work with. He is knowledgeable on   everything in the shop and makes recommendations  based on your budget and what you need without any pressure. Stop in , you will not be disappointed.

As far as airports go, this one is very good. Easy pickup and drop off, security lines and ease of getting through seems to be perfected over the years. What I like most is the services and restaurants offered. I like that they have community work stations in almost all of the wings. You can charge your devices and work if need be. Alot of the cool restaurants in Scottsdale and Phoenix have a location at the airport too, making it nice to come early and enjoy a nice dinner before a flight.

Tried to have a romantic dinner at this place with m y wife. Food was great, but the service not so good. Rude wait staff. Maybe a Jersey thing?? but I'm from Jersey and wasn't feeling the love...

I've been here a few times  thinking I would give it a chance, but its always the same. Tourist trap for sure since its the only game in town. Pies are great, but the food is marginal at best and the service sucks!

Located at the corner of pinnacle peak and Scottsdale road , Toyama specializes in authentic Japanese cuisine.  This is a  very small restaurant with only a dozen tables and a sushi bar. The food is very tasty and the sushi very fresh. The service is a little slow though.. We were served one dinner at a time making it a little difficult to eat together.

Great place for ribs and chicken and your favorite beer! On Sunday morning they have a breakfast buffet. During football season go here if you are a Steelers fan! Lots of Motorcycle parking if you are on your bike. Service is a little mediocre though, but it's  Cavecreek...

Not a very busy or attractive restaurant but don't let that fool you.  The dinner experience didn't start off so well, but it got really good later on. My wife and I ordered a glass of pinot grigio and it was very cloudy and tasted watered down. So I asked the waiter to bring out the bottle and it was a bottle of House Pinot Grigio that I've had before,but the wine in the bottle was much clearer than what was in our glasses. Not really sure what  was all about.  I started off with a wilted spinach salad. It was delicious. The preparation for the salad takes place table side where they saute the bacon in a pan then cover the spinach with the hot pan so that the spinach becomes wilted.  My main course was Eastern scallops. The scallops look to be flashed in a little bit of flower and they were delicious. The homemade au gratin potatoes came along with it as a side and the steamed vegetables were perfect. My wife had the petite filet that was cooked to perfection. Surprisingly , the petite filet was much larger than any of the other steak houses in the Phoenix area . Hands down it's one of the best filets that I've ever had  To close the night out we went with banana fosters made tableside for all four of us. I haven't had it in a long time and man was it good!  I give this restaurant 4 stars not because of the drink situation earlier, but I'm not a real big fan of live keyboard singer music during dinner. You have to be really really really good to pull that off.

CJ'S has really gone down hill and is in major need of a face lift. I have been coming here from time to time for the last 15 years for kids parties, golf range and mini golf and have been disappointed with the way the facility is maintained.  The prices keep going up and the quality and variety of attractions stay the same with very little or no mainteance. I'm really surprised this place is still in business.

Not a very good dinning experience if you plan on sitting anywhere other than a Teppanyaki station. I've visited this place 2 times in the last year.During our last visit we sat at the bar thinking we could get a quick meal and drink. We where mistaken!! We ordered 3 sushi rols and a fillet. Our food came out in 45 minutes and getting a drink in this place was like pulling teeth. I will not return.

QT is definitely a step up from the other well known "C" store. Their staff is so much more proffesional and courteous. The food is freshly made and offer a wide variety to chose from. This place is very clean and inviting. Gas is priced competitively too.

This place has very good N.Y. style pizza. I like to stop here on a Friday night so I can have a drink at the bar and talk to the staff while I wait for take out pizza. This place boasts a 20 inch pie and has a few unique types of combinations on the menu.

I have a lifted truck and most car washes will not wash my car without doing a hand wash. I stopped in here on a Sunday and got a full car wash inside and out for 12 bucks. The best thing about it is they gave me no hassle and I was in and out in 15 minutes.

I have been seeing Dr. Gilbertson for 5 years now.  He is very personable and easy to talk to. I am pleased with his staff and glad he was able to establish a successful partnership with Scottsdale Dental Studio.

Its hard to write about a drug and cosmetic store because they are all so boring. This Walgreen is conveniently locates at Greenway and Tatum on the north west side. I like the fact that there is a drive up window to make it easier to pick up prescriptions.  The staff is pretty helpful too. They seem to not mind stopping what they are doing to help. There is also a chase atm located here. If you have to wait for a prescription , be sure to stop in at the dunkin donuts for a coffee or modern grove for a bite to eat.

I really expected better based on the reviews. The first  annoying thing about this place is that the tables are so uncomfortable to sit at. The tables are crafted out of old spools and they sit so much higher than a standard table. I am 6'4" and was very uncomfortable. Second, most of what they serve  is deep fried to the point where the place fills up with this blue haze. It really makes your clothing wreak afterward. Lastly, it's the strip not Manhattan... way over priced for just "ok" food. There is much better and shame on me for not checking out the area first.

Best kept secret in North Scottsdale. Very authentic and tasty food. Plus the menu has all the tradioanl stuff pluss a good healthy mix of new and interesting dishes. Ask to have Angel wait on you! He likes to deviate off of the menu and will make some good recomendations. He's pretty funny too!

I highly recommend this dealership if you are in the market for a new car or SUV. I recently traded my truck for a car and spent no more than an hour picking a car suitable for my needs, negotiating, completing paperwork and taking delivery. The sales pro, Stan Powell was very easy to work with and delivered on every promise.  The service advisor, Armond is on top of his game too. They even detailed the scratches and fixed a few things on a return visit and provided a loaner car!    I'm gonna miss my truck... but that's part of growing up I guess. For a "No Bull" experience go see Earnhardt Cadillac!

So, I am out an about on Saturday running errands etc. and I see on of those Sushi places that have the revolving Sushi  Bar... I get so stoked because it's quick and easy sit down , eat , and get out.. I'm thinking perfect!. Walk in and there's about 8 people in front of me for a seat at the bar. So, I figure,  ok so what ..I'll miss out on the experience of the revolving tuna roll express and suck it up at a sit down table. I approach the host and say "hi, I would like a table since the bar is busy, looks like your wide open." She replies "15 minute longa wait, that side of restaurant closed" I'm like WTF! REALLY? all this business sitting around and THAT SIDE IS CLOSED??? I just stormed out and went to smash burger... ugh

My kids and I decided to go out of town last minute to see if the last round of Supercross. So I went looking for tickets online and found StubHub. I was able to find the tickets that we wanted at a reasonable price. So we packed up the truck and took the four and a half hour drive to Las Vegas and picked up the tickets at the local StubHub office located on Dean Martin Drive just across the highway from Caesars Palace. It was surprisingly easy to pick up the tickets. It's a little hard to find because the address that they print on their website is not 100 percent accurate. If at all possible print your tickets from your home or from your office instead of choosing to pick him up from the StubHub office in Las Vegas. It'll save you 20 to 30 minutes.

I work just above this cafe. This a quick place to grab lunch or breakfast for a reasonable price. Daily lunch specials a plus! Wes and his crew are all very nice people. Try the honey badger wrap if it happens to be on the special menu. It is very tasty!

What a gem, located in airpark just across from EOS fitness. This place serves up some of the most authentic Mexican food in Scottsdale. The bartender is very knowledgable on tequilas and does not mind making custom margaritas to your liking. My favorite is the Chilli Relleno! The absolute best I have ever tasted.

Modern grove is a local restaurant tocated at Tatum and Greenway. This place specializes in home grown , organic local choices ranging from pizza to salads. One of my favorites is the turkey burger. Its served with your choices of vegetables ; but what's best is that its extremely juicy. Great selection of beer and wines too.

I give this place four stars because it's really outstanding  food! The fries are fresh cut and the hamburger meat is quality. However, their prices are way outta line compared to the  competition. Cheese burgers, fries, & a drink $14.00.?!?!

IT's 6pm amd the place is empty. Save yourself some time and money and visit the few other burger joints in the area . The burgers here are super small and the fries a little over done and dont have any flavor. Just not worth the money at all...Huge disappointment

I should have just stayed home and baked some dinosaur nuggets... Chicken fingers (only) and lame employees. I ordered the sandwich hoping to get something different then just chicken fingers, but no, they just slapped 3 chicken fingers between a bun and called it a chicken sandwich...   The employees dont speak at all either and they mad dog you when you place your order.... My kids like the place and is the reason for the 2 stars ( one for each kid), but what kid doesn't appreciate fried garbage..  If only they had a disco ball.... oh wait they do!!!

Just moved to the area about 2 months ago and found this awesome bike shop. I stopped in on a Sunday at about 2 p.m. with my bike and got two new fresh tires and tubes done on the spot within 1 hour. The shop is legit, nice people and awesome gear. they have everything you need!
