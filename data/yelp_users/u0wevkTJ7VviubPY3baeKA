I walked in just as they were closing after driving an hour there.  A man came up to me and said they had closed but when I explained to him that I just needed to walk through and knew exactly what to pick out but all I needed was the order number for my installer he said "come on in" very nicely. He pointed me to a woman behind a counter (who I assume is the one not answering the calls when I had called earlier on my way to find out what time they closed.....it just rang and rang). She looked at me with a blank stare and said "we are closed". I explained that the man let me in...yada yada yada. She looked at him and said "you help her then" and he politely said "I can't I am with a customer" then the two of them began to bicker which made me feel very uncomfortable.  Then, he came up to me and handed me a hard hat and piece of paper and quickly gave me instructions on how to get the information I needed. I walked in and headed right where I needed to be. About 2 mins later another woman came up to me and said "miss...do you know we are closed?" to which I explained again and she was rude on that she seemed annoyed and wouldn't look at me and briskly walked away. I then saw the slab I wanted and asked her a question about it (she was nearby) and she was being very passive aggressive with me and once again recommended I just go ahead and an appointment. I got so frustrated I simply said "no thank you" and walked out.   I was too much trouble and they were rude about it. Bottom line.   It looked as the product is great but being a business owner myself with someone ready to spend several thousands of dollars on your product it was very disheartening to be treated so unprofessionally.

This place is amazing as we were in a panic about our labradoodle being ill. We saw Dr. Lenius and he was so kind and gentle. He continually checked on us giving updates of our dog's health. They went over and beyond with reviewing every possibility yet being aware of spending. Everyone was extremely welcoming, supportive and loving and it was so appreciated. Amazing service.

Heidi's Events and Catering is a fantastic option for throwing a wonderful party. The staff is very responsive and creative and the food has always been a big hit for any of my events. I have been in the wedding and event industry for almost 10 years and have worked with Heidi at least a dozen times. They are very open to working with big to small budgets and stretching your dollar as far as it can be stretched. The food has always been yummy and the presentation always colorful. We love Heidi's!

Seriously...it can't get any better. It's just not possible. Sapphire Bookkeeping is amazing and completely understands individual as well as small business needs/desires. I own a small company and initially was doing all of the bookkeeping myself, then hired a company I found on Craigslist who destroyed all of my files (meaning made them super unorganized and random) so Sapphire Bookkeeping swept in and in no time fixed all the errors and got me back on track. We work with Tiffany and she is always quick with answers to any question or need we have. They have been an incredible asset to our company growth and have helped us tremendously. I have already recommended several other business to Sapphire Bookkeeping and I will continue to do so.

Beautiful salon. Very very clean. Fantastic service. My sister and I went in to get A full set and pedicures and we were completely pampered. On my way there now to get A fill and I'm excited to just relax in their salon.
