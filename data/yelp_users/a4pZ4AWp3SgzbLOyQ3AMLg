We went to eat here on a Wednesday night. Kind of crowded, but still we were seated within about 10 minutes (party of 2).  We were seated, then we waited.. and waited. Finally another waiter came to take our drink and food order, he said the assigned waiter was too busy. We gave him our non-complicated order: appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 drinks. Our assigned waiter finally came around, oblivious to the fact that someone else already took our order.  Food came out fairly quickly, could have been a bit faster. Our assigned waiter brought out our entrees - no appetizer. I was a bit frustrated, but we began to ate our meals anyway. After awhile I think our waiter know how irritated we were, so the manager came by. The manager apologized (which was great), ordered our appetizer and brought it out immediately and offered us a dessert - all on the house!  I was very impressed with their ability to sense a problem and quickly correct it. For that, I will definitely return!!

We decided to try this place for the first time today. First impression was great - the place looked real nice.   Service was horrible! We waited for our drinks, we waited to order, we waited for our food, we waited for drink refills. We waited from entrance to food served - almost 40 minutes! My order wasn't complete, I had to ask for my toast. Someone else at our table also just got up and asked for refills.   The food itself was okay. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible. I thought my omelet had a bit too much cheese and the potatoes seemed almost tasteless. For the cost, I felt cheated.  Honestly, I will NOT go here again.

Went there on Sat 5/13 with 4 kids and 2 adults from 5pm-6pm. Paid $52 for two new cards for $22 with 125 points on them each.We opted for these kind of cards so the kids could play the ticket redemption games. We had 2 kids share a card and it took them about an hour to go through it. We redeemed our tickets and went into the BARE prize area. A lot of bins were empty and everything seemed to be overpriced (compared to Dave and Busters). One of the prize bins CLEARLY had marked 10 tickets for a single piece of candy. So my kids loaded up on these because they could get a bunch of them. When we got to the counter to check out the clerk (whom was very rude) starts arguing with us that the candies are 20 tickets each not 10. We show him the sign on the huge bin of candies and he rips it off and said, "That's wrong, it's 20 tickets." He was extremely rude and unforgiving and this attitude alone will make me NEVER go here again.  Pros: -Inside AZ Mill Mall  Cons: -Extremely rude workers - where I purchased our game cards and the ticket redemption area -Lots of the games were broken -Games that had seats, the seats were extremely torn and worn out -Women's bathroom was disgusting, not sure if they check it regularly -Expensive ticket redemption prizes  My conclusion: I will never take my family here again.

We're frequent visitors of Cindy's. Our family of 5 loves it! 2 adults and 3 kids - we can all find something on the menu we like!  Pros: - Things we've ordered that are delicious: chicken fried steak, breakfast burrito, eggs, hash browns, (kids) cheeseburger. - Great service: waitress and cashier are so friendly! - Kids get a treat on the way out! My kids love it!   Cons: - Decor is a little older and it's a bit hokey - One time it smelled like cigarette smoke very badly. I wasn't sure if it was from their patio section or another guest who was a very heavy smoker.  Will continue to come here.

I've been here about 10 times...and I only go when certain a certain bands play.  Pros:  -Great that they welcome lots of local bands -Fairly good drink prices -Delicious Tom Collins drink  Cons: -They've "lost" our debit card when we opened a tab. Or they gave it to someone else at closing. Not fun.(I've been told another friend had their card overcharged also.) -Their waitresses visibly hate it when you don't open a tab. -When not opening a tab, they take FOREVER to bring you bill. -Waitresses constantly get us brown-skinned people mixed up and even said, "You all look the same." (definitely not cool and a crappy excuse for bad service)  In summary, their drinks, location and entertainment are great.  The bad service of the waitresses make me dread going sometimes.  Again, I'll go to the place but only when certain bands are playing. And if I go, I'll pay cash and sit at the bar.

Wow, this place has improved! Lately there haven't been any mix ups of credit cards or tabs and no insulting comments by the servers! I now look forward going here whenever local bands play.  Improvements: bartenders, service, servers

We got a coupon/gift certificate for this place from restaurant.com. We were seated promptly and drinks ordered. HOWEVER, after the waitress took our order it took 40 minutes to get our food. This was ridiculous. Our waitress tried to act tough and kept saying she was demanding the cooks get our food in "10 minutes" - we noticed other people who came in after us got their food before us!   The food itself was good, I got the hog sandwich and my boyfriend got the trio sliders - both very good and good portions. However, due to the slow service we will not try this place again.

I've been here twice. Once long ago in 2008 or 2009, then again in March 2013. It's fairly small and intimate place.  PROS: -Love the style and ambiance, underground -Drinks: ass juice, leprechaun piss, Tom Collins were all delicious and reasonably priced -Bartender was nice and quick -Jukebox was filled with great tunes  CONS: -Parking lot is a tad small for the place, had to park across the street - but at least they have a crosswalk  We will definitely return another time!

I've ate here 3 times. Once in 2011 and twice March 2013. I liked it.   Food I thought was great/delicious: prime rib and mashed potatoes! Mini square cheesecakes with a raspberry sauce. Mimosas!  Food I thought was just "good": This last time I tried the omelet station, it was good, but not great. Same with the potatoes and biscuits and gravy.  Service: 2 of 3 were good waitresses, one was just grouchy. But the other two more than made up for it.  Value: It's a tad expensive, but we tried another buffet about the same price (on the strip) and Le Village was definitely tastier and better quality.

I love this place! My favorite venue/bar in the Phoenix metro area.  Things I like: - Owner and waitress: Jason (I think) and Taniesha - provide great service! - Drink prices and quality: perfect!  - Shows: GREAT bands come through here!  Things I don't like: - ...sometimes it feels small when there are popular bands playing. I can live with it.  Yep, I will keep coming here! Definitely a cool, laid-back place to have a few drinks and see some good shows.

We've been here several times... every time it's delicious!  We've tried chicken, pork and beef tamales. My favorite are the pork tamales (they seem a little spicier than the beef) and my hubby's favorite are the chicken tamales. Plus, it's decently priced - as of August 2013, I can get a dozen for about $16.  I will keep coming back.

Pros: -Mesa location -Mini-chimis on menu for about $8  Cons: -20 minute wait for 2 people. (it was a Friday night though) -Sitting in the bar area, it took awhile to get drinks and menus. -After we sat, it took 20 minutes for our order to be taken and put into the kitchen.  I won't be coming back here anytime soon.

Went here October 2014. This place has good pizza and wings, but the wait staff can't handle a good sized crowd. Waited for 10 minutes and asked to have a dirty table cleaned up, waited another 5-10 minutes and nothing. You might get prompt service from the token greased if you're a cute girl, otherwise steer clear unless it's dead. Sad, I had such high hopes for this place. More wait staff, signage saying seat yourself or hire a hostess maybe?

We live in the area and have tried Lenny's twice - both times it's been awesome! I tried the burgers and chicken - both delicious. They're homemade ranch is delicious and they're burgers are so good with their homemade sauce.  The staff/service is great - very friendly, prompt.   My only complaint is they don't have a kids menu, but it's not going to stop us from going!   We're definitely long-term customers!

Tried this place once on a Saturday afternoon (between 2-4pm), it was dead. We sat at the bar and waited close to 15 minutes to acknowledged by a waitress and get a drink ordered. The drinks were good, but it took another 10 minutes to get our check. If it wasn't for the awful, slow service we would have probably stayed longer or purchased more items - but that didn't work out.   Pros:  - Location: Close to Cinemark to get a drink before a movie. -.Mixed drinks: Their vodka drinks were delicious.  Cons: - BAD SERVICE  The bad services was just too much to take and I will NOT be visiting this place again. I'll try other places nearby than to try this place again.

My family has eaten here several times in 2015 - 2 adults, 1 teenager, 2 small kids. Usually it costs about $40-45 to feed our family of 5. We live in Mesa and twice we've driven over to Tempe just to eat here.  Items we've ordered: fries, onion rings, the char with cheese and bacon, and mushroom char.  Pros: -Quick and friendly service! -They don't charge for ranch -They haven't messed up our order (we have picky eaters - no onions, no pickles, etc.) -Quality and price are great -Onion rings are absolutely delicious every time  Cons: -Not very many locations  Overall: I prefer to come here than In and Out or Red Robin, but my husband doesn't agree with me. But we'll keep coming to this place when we're in the area!

We've ate and drank here 4 times. I will say it's consistent! I like it.  Delicious food: pork sliders, burger sliders, pizza Okay (not great) food: pretzel bread  Drinks! The lion lemonade is delicious! They have a few other "girly" drinks on their happy hour menu that are good. Pretty much every drink we try is good.  Pros: -Sliders -Pizza -Mixed drinks -happy hour and REVERSE happy hour - good deals! -Clean and updated  Cons: -During the week they close at 11p or 12a, they don't have bar hours

Very glad we found this place through Yelp!! We've been there twice now. The very first time we visited, I thought the area looked a little run down (due to road construction), but it's VERY NICE inside of their building!  Pros: - FOOD! Things we've tried: chicken chimichanga, pork enchilada, beef flauta/taquito, beef enchilada, beef taco... everything is so good! Nothing is greasy - everything is full of flavor! Their chips and salsa are delicious! Perfect balance of heat and chunkiness! The proportions are huge! Even the kids meals are big! Such great value. - SERVICE! Great service. We've gotten the same waitress both times we went and she is great! Plus, everyone there seems so helpful and constantly offer help with chip refills, drink refills, just checking up. It's amazing. - APPEARANCE: The inside of their building is very nice. Nice decor, nice cantina setup. Everything looks very clean and new.  Cons: - NONE!   I'm so glad we found this place and will definitely become regulars here and I hope this business thrives!   Sincerely, A new loyal customer

Okay, I've given this place several times to redeem itself and every time it was NOT the same. This is sad, back in 2012 this place was great! Not sure what happened at the end of 2013 and all of 2014.   Sad.

I've been here about 4 times since the new management took over and change the name. At first, I was a bit partial to the old owner and bartender, but this place is now growing on me.  PROS: -Renovated! Nice floors and the place has been thoroughly scrubbed. -The owner makes the best drinks -Support the local music scene and bands  CONS: -Sometimes the place is pretty dead -During a listening party, the sound wasn't the best by the bar  Overall, this place has won me over and I'll definitely support them!

Came here twice and so far I like! We've tried glazed, chocolate glazed, raspberry filled donut holes and glazed donut holes. Everything was tasty and super fresh! Will return for donuts and may try out one of their sandwiches. Oh, they also service breakfast sandwiches all day and they're open 24 hours!

We live super close to this place and were excited when it opened.....and so far we've been let down. We've been there twice:  Pros: -Seated quickly both times -Bartender (I think he's the owner too) makes great drinks -Mozzarella sticks were good  Cons: -Waitresses aren't very good or attentive or even friendly or quick -I'm pretty sure I got the wrong flavor of wings and the waitress argued with me. I ate them anyway and didn't want them to make more. -Food is sometimes hit or miss - pizza is okay but not great, wings aren't anything special. -Food wait time is ridiculous. Both times it took a long time to get our food and it didn't come out at the same time, which was weird. (But I think it was because our waitress missed an item and put it in late.)  We'll try it again a couple times, but this might be a place we go for drinks only (not food). Overall, just disappointed.
