My absolute favorite spot in Tempe! Such a surprising treat from such a hole-in-the-wall type spot. The beer selection is quite nice and their pasty's (pronounced Pass-Tee) are perfectly prepared. I've had everything on the menu, but keep finding myself ordering the Pilgrim over and over again. Definitely finish it off with the banoffee pie for the overall experience.  They also have a vegetarian version of nearly all their pasty's which is quite nice.

Mediocre sushi and they don't do take out on the weekends??! You're crammed in the corner of a Target shopping center. I've eaten here twice because of proximity. Food is decent, but nothing great. Dine-in is less than desirable so I will have had to run out of options before ordering from here again with how difficult they make it to order from Fri-Sun.

I was referred to Sunday Cycles by a friend and I have to say that they did such an awesome job from start to finish in setting up my bike. They worked with me in building my first single speed mountain bike and provided awesome recommendations and service all the way through. Couldn't be happier to have been introduced to these guys and certainly happy they are now located at 32nd St. and Shea! These guys know their stuff and at no point did I ever feel like I was being "sold". I can't get enough of my new bike!!

Drove here to find that Two Hippies Breakfast Joint has now become Melrose Kitchen! The decor is fairly different, but the menu and staff is pretty much the same. Glad to see the 6 ingredient custom burrito was still available.

Can't begin to describe how appreciative I am that services like this exist. It was incredibly difficult to say goodbye to my best friend for the past 12 and a half years, but I couldn't imagine a better setting for her. She was able to go very peacefully and surrounded by loved ones in one of her favorite settings within my sisters home. Gentle Journey did an amazing job in describing the necessary steps that were about to take place, what to expect and allowed plenty of time to say good-bye. A truly top notch service and would recommend it to anyone facing this incredibly tough decision. Thank you for everything. We will forever be thankful for the delicate care you provided Roxy in her final moments.
