I love breakfast and I love The Farm House. It is a bit cramped and busy but since I'm usually dining solo, the counter always has a place open. The daily special scrambles are very tasty and each order comes with home fried potatoes and whole wheat french bread. The coffe is also very good as well as they use Illy coffee. One thing to look out for if you sit at the counter is that you come face to face with two of their fresh made chocolate cakes. It takes every inch of my will power not to order a slice, but alas chocolate cake has won out a couple of times.

I had a fever and the the only thing to cure it was... more LoLo's chicken and waffles! I was actually there with Dave R. because we had a hankering for fried chicken. We both ordered #3's along with the red Kool-Aid. I opted for beans over rice and Dave had the fried okra.  The chicken came out nice and hot with just the right amount of crispyness that's not from too much batter or coating, but from the right amount of frying. The waffles were the perfect compliment. The right amount of sweetness along with the heaping spoonfull of butter on top. The rice and beans were knid of put off to the side because of the "main event" but were tasty none the less. My only concern was the sweetness of the Kool-Aid. I couldn't remember the last time I had Kool-Aid, but I never remembering it being this sugary. Maybe my mom had the right idea and only put 1 cup of sugar in to mix. What, the recipe only calls for one cup? This was my 4th visit to LoLo's since moving out here last year. I was a regular at Roscoe's in Long Beach, CA and the only difference is in the waffle. Roscoe's puts cinamon in their waffle batter that gives it a unique taste.  Also, unless you have been fasting for a week, the #1 is a lot of food! I finally learned my lesson and went for the #3 and I still couldn't finish my waffles.

My heart is now filled with joy and happiness. What for, you may ask. Since moving out to AZ last year from Southern California (don't say Cali, that's in Colombia) I haven't been able to find a donut shop unless you want to call Basha's a donut shop.  While driving down Arizona Ave one morning, the familiar smell of sugary goodness wafted into the open window of my car. DONUTS! Pulled a U-turn and wept with joy. All the familiar offerings were there. The apple fritters and cinnamon rolls the size of man hole covers, chocolate long johns, even the plain raised cake. I ordred an apple fritter and a raised cake. Absolutely, positively heaven in a little, white greasy bag! Go early because they only make so many of the bigger apple fritters and cinnamon rolls. The only "complaint" is that the coffee is nothing more than hot water with a brown crayon dipped in it to give it that coffee color. More cowbell!

Again, I'm taking a trip back home to California and my car always needs to have something done. This time, tires. I asked some of my friends and one of them recommended East Valley Tire. So I went out there and found what looked like and old gas station with tires stacked out front and the  guys changing tires in the stalls where the gas pumps used to be. I asked the guy who ran the place (I'm sorry I didn't ask what his name was) if they had my size tire in stock. He took me into their stock room and showed me what they had. They had new and slightly used tires. He told me the used tires came off of cars that had put new rims and different size tires on. I picked out 2 and awaited what my total would be. $100 for both out the door with mounting and balancing! I almost had to ask again before my brain whispered to me "Say yes, it's a deal". They had me pull my car up into one of the spots and the tire mechanic went right to work on it. 20 minutes later, he comes up and says 'Dude, your all set". Huh? Really? After a walk around the car to check out the new tires, I'm off! I know the place looks a little rough around the edges, but if you want a good deal on tires check out East Valley Tire.

It was time for me to replace the struts and shocks for my Mazda. Did my homework and got some estimates and figured I had to take a bite of the bullet being shot my way. As I wandered around looking for more esimates, I went to Advanced as a last resort. And I'm glad I did! They were at least $300 less than the other places I went and they were also going to put the OEM struts and shocks in. Even the dealer couldn't match that. My car rides nice and smooth now and I can tackle the rough CA highways when I go back for visits.

So I'm heading out to California and I decide to "load up" before I hit the road. I've been wanting to try Matt's ever since I moved here last year. So, I get up early to try to get a head start on traffic and lo and behold, traffic. I finally get there after a few wrong turns (Thanks stupid GPS, you're going back from whence you came). I sidle up to the bar and now the decicsion begins. Eggs? Omelette? Cakes? Cakes it is and a side of bacon. While I wait with my cup of coffee, which wasn't half bad, I take in the smallness of this place. Glad I got there early. The GriddleCakes arrive with the bacon. The sweet cream they use makes other places cakes seem like toast. Rich and fluffy with the melting butter on top and real maple syrup, Wooo! The bacon was nice. Cooked to where it wasn't too crispy or too rubbery. And with pepper. Now I just hope I don't fall asleep during my drive. Oh, and what's with the metered parking. I put my .60 in the meter which should have given me an hour and I go out to my car 45 minute later and the meter says expired. What?

Being Filipino and having moved to Gilbert last year from Southern California, one of my first objectives was to find a Filipino food restaurant here in the valley. I found Lumpia Factory by accident by just exploring around Chandler one day. I found enough of the things I grew up eating (pancit, lumpia and adobo) and also tried some dishes that I heard about but never tried (menudo, which is way different than the mexican offering and apritada). It still isn't like what mom used to make, but what restaurant really does that. In a pinch, Lumpia Factory takes care of that craving I get for "home cooking".

When I'm in a quandry on what I want to eat, chinese is always at the top of my list. And the topper of that list is Asian Cafe Express or ACE as my friend Dave R and I call it. If it's your first time going there you might think to yourself, hmmm, so I order off the wall menu? They do have an expansive menu that not only has chinese food but also food from Singapore, Japan and Thai variations. I'm pretty much a simple guy to please, so chicken with vegetables is my choice. The chicken comes out tender and they use breast instead of thigh meat that a lot of other chinese places use. The vegetables still has that crunch to them and not the overdone limpness that you get at some places. The service is always excellent and quick. If you can get past the looks of the interior and just base it on the food, ACE is the Place. (I couldn't resist)

Since moving out here from California, I'm always on the look out for local "flavor". I saw this place while exploring the new neighborhood and made a point to stop in. Came by on a friday afternoon and the place was pretty empty except for a few people in the separate dining area. I ordered the cheeseburger with gruyere, sweet potato fries and a chocolate shake. The burger came out dry even though I asked for it to be cooked medium. The cheese was pretty non existant. I really don't like making a big fuss about food, so I choked it down. The fries and shake were the highlight. The sweet potato fries were nice and crisp with the tender insides piping hot and my shake was one of the best I've ever had. If there were a way I could get a half star put on here I would because one the people sitting in that other room was Joe the owner. The way I figured that one out was because he looked like the caricature on the menu. Nice man, but I lied to him when I said my burger was good. Sorry!

Redemption. Just like the what the USA Olympic basketball team did at the recent games, Joe's Farm Grill redeemed themselves today.       I just had to give them one more chance. Maybe I caught them on a bad day when I went there in June. I was initially going to go to El Taco Loco to give them a try but alas they were already closed. So I made my way back up Higley and I thought I'd give Joe another chance.      I ordered the Farm Burger with cheddar and grilled onions which came with regular fries and the requisite chocolate shake. The burger this time came out nice and juicy with the grilled (they should be called caramelized) onions giving it the finishing touch. Also this time I noticed that the pickles had a kinda sweet kinda dill flavor to them. Very interesting in a really tasty way. The fries, like the sweet potato fries I had earlier, came out crisp on the outside and tender and pipng hot inside. And the shake, oh the shake. It's sooo good!   So to you, Joe's Farm Grill, you have redemmed yourselves and I hereby put you in my "What do I want to eat" rotation.

I've been to Bongo's twice already and both times I have been very happy that I did. A little hole in the wall place that if you're driving by on McClintock, you could easily miss it. After a round of golf (Shot my best round in 5 years!) we headed over and proceeded to try to make the decision on what to order off of the vast menu selections. I had the Meat Stack (Yes it was) the first time, so I decided to try the Chicken Fried Steak burger only to find out that it wouldn't be available due to the freezer being repaired. Well, I ordered the Breakfast Burger with waffle fries. When the waitress brought it to the table, I was floored by the enormity of it. Bun, burger, cheese, fried egg, lettuce and tomato. As I tried to manuever this thing into my mouth, I caught a glimpse of something else settled in between the ingredients. HAM! I somehow got a bite and everything just seemed to be all right with the world. All the ingredients balanced out right. Hint of bacon, hint of cheese, the richness of the fried egg and a little ham to finish. The waffle fries were nice and crisp too. They also serve Tater Tots as a side as well. I don't know if my good round of golf made Bongo's taste better, so I'll have to go after a bad round. Or just go because I like this place.

Okay, maybe I'm being a little harsh but Kabuki hit the big fail button! Maybe my darling co-worker as well for not checking the order before bringing it back. A co-worker and I wanted to try it out for lunch and since it's in close proximity of our workplace, we said let's go. We called in our order, I had ordered the Bar-B-Que rib and tempura combo and she ordred the Gold Rush Roll and Vegetable Roll. When she came back, hers looked amazing and mine, well, wasn't what I expected. It was SALMON! How the hell do you get salmon and bar-b-que rib mixed up. And also there wasn't any tempura sauce in the bag. Being pressed for time, I sat there and gagged down the dry salmon (teriyaki sauce did nothing for me) and tempura. If there was a survey tip in the "Good for" that said nothing, I would put my check mark there.

I don't care what time of the year it is, I love soup. And one of my favorites is pho. I went there the first time with David R because he loves pho as much as I do. He may be more asian than me though he isn't.  The decor wasn't like most of the pho places I've been to where it seems like they want you to get in, eat and get out. Cozy atmosphere and a water sculpture.   I oredered the #19 which had rare steak, well done flank, tendon and tripe. Everything came out very quickly. The steaming broth was nice and clear and was less salty.   Let's see, it's 12:33 right now, must be time for pho!

I'd like to thank the good Lord above for bringing another filipino restaurant to the valley! (And for yelp for letting me know about it) I visited Karey's tonight because I had that hankerin' for filipino and since it was close to work and was getting great reviews I decided, hell yes! After finding the tucked away business, I was warmly greeted by Karen and her brother. She told me of the already prepared food that she had and if there were something else I had in mind, she would happily prepare it for me. I decided on tha chicken adobo burrito with garlic rice and lumpia. I asked her about some other filipino dishes, she said she still had some pinakbet (a meat and vegetable stew) so I ordered that as well. Now, I ordered this to go but I live in Gilbert so I was a little wary if the lumpia was still going to have it's crispyness to it after my commute home. The delicious little guys made it home and still had their delightful crunch to them. Next was a bite of the burrito. The chicken was very tender and not dried out like sometimes adobo can get. It also didn't have the sometimes overpowering bite of vinegar that is common in adobo. It had a nice balanced taste that lended it well for making burritos with. The pinakbet was a bit of a dissappointment, it was little on the bland and dry side, but I am judging this on how my mother used to make it. I asked about any specials coming up, like lechon, and she said that in a couple of weeks they're going to have another lechon roast. She also said that if there was anything that isn't on the menu and if she knows of the recipe, she would be glad to prepare it, all you need to do is call. Karey's is going into my full rotation even if it's a good half hour away!

I've been looking for something to break me out of the dining rut I've been in and I'm so glad I chose Millie's to break me out of it. Small place on Main, so don't go to fast or you just might pass it. As I entered, I was greeted by Jacob. I ordered the Roast pork with white rice and beans and a drink. It was then that I noticed the cash only sign. I asked Jacob where the nearest ATM was (Food City just down the street) and told him I'd be right back. When I did, he had my order out quickly. The pork was tender and juicy and not seasoned too much which brought out the flavor of the pork more. But the star of the meal were the rice and beans. The rice was nice and fluffy and the beans were seasoned very nicely and also had some small chunks of kambucha or carabasa cooked in with it. Since I was the only customer in the place, Jacob asked if he could join me as he ate his lunch. It was nice to talk to an owner of an establishment as we had our meals. I will be coming back again to try some of the other dishes. Oh, and I'll remember to bring cash.

I made an appointment with Tonya to have my a/c repaired with Arizona Dukes of Air because the fan wasn't turning on my unit. Made the appointment for Monday at 7am. Robert called me and told me he would be by at 7:15. At 7:15, the orange van pulled up and I showed Robert where the unit was and told him the problem. In a couple of minutes he told me that my capacitor was bad. He installed a new dual capacitor which will help minimize any further problems. And it was less than I expected to pay. Took him less than 45 minutes from when he arrived to when he left and most of that time was gabbing about living in Orange County. (He's originally from there like I am) Robert was a cool guy and if you need your a/c worked on, give Arizona Dukes of Air a call.
