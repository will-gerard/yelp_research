The first time I ate at Corbins 3 years ago it was just meidocre but not now.  WOW!!  Saw review on Check Please Arizona, they raved about the fried chicken my husbands fav.  Did not disappoint!!  They have a different mac n chz every night,  it was really good.  Desert was AMAZING a warm  pound cake soaked in countreau and cinnamin and cardemon with a side vanilla ice cream.  Service was perfect especially since we were '"that" couple with the 2 year old kid (she behaved but still dining with a 2 year old can be tricky).  What a GREAT meal from start to finish.  Glad I tried Corbin's again, we are hooked.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  The best place for vegans!!  The samosas rock.  It is so awesome that I can eat EVERYTHING on the menu.  The ice machine is hilarious.  GREAT.

So bad.  The food was inedible.  Salad was awful weak dressing mixed greens with bland cheese.   Fries and onion rings mushy.  2 items i wanted both not available.  No veggie patty option.  Service was awesome which is the only reason we did not walk out.  Unpleasant.  Hubby and i have been tummy sick all night.  Bummer.  Really wanted to like it.

Upward restuarants does it again.  I love the concept of revamping old buildings.  The food was good.  Service good.  We just happened to hit the first night of official business.  Pizza and friend polenta was carb over-load but so good.  Trendy and cool.  I am nostalgic for the old Humpty Dumpty building next door, that housed the closed Aeillos, this will be the next venture.  Central Avenue is moving and shaking.
