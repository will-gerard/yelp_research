This place is huge! I seriously couldn't believe the size on the place.  Has plenty of room to do whatever you want. Has 4 pools that are all right next to each other.  The pools were very crowded, so I would get there early!  My only complaint is that everything seemed to close at 8 pm, including the pools and hot tub.  They said they start staying open later when it's warmer, but to us 70 degrees was good enough weather to hang in the pool.

Service wasn't great, food was meh, beer wasn't good.  The price was good and I've had a lot worse in Vegas.  This place just wasn't what I'd hope it was.

This is a refreshing and new bar that you don't see anywhere in  Utah.  Somewhat feels like your in an old cabin or something. Bar tenders seem nice and the drinks are big. Not to shabby!

I'm really surprised to see some of the negative reviews on this place. I had a great experience.  I was in Phoenix visiting family and friends when we decided to stop here on the way home from the airport. The inside is really neat. It's dim, but very modern looking. I honestly was a little nervous to look at the prices because of it. The waiter when he came over seemed like his job was the best thing to ever happen to the planet. Picture the annoying guy at the Apple Store trying to explain why Apple is the best thing in the world... but toned down. It actually was a good thing. We ordered the queso and moved on to checking out the rest of the menu. Its not a huge menu but has some unique options. When the waiter came back I asked about 2 different options... chicken or pork tacos. Not only was he certain which one he wanted me to have, he decided to describe both in great detail. He knew every ingredient and the order in which it was put on the tacos. And these were not ordinary tacos. All sorts of wonderful stuff on those bad boys. The food was great. Portions were small, and it was a little overpriced, but overall I quite enjoyed myself.

I think this place had a lot of potential but we had a terrible time here. We waited 25 minutes to be seated, which is fine, but 2 groups were seated immediately when they came in after us.  When we were finally seated the waiter took 30 minutes to notice we were there. Finally he took our order checked our id's and everything is fine. Then a minute or so later, the manager comes over and says he needs to check my id again. Since I am from utah, we are issued paper id's before we get our normal id's and that's what I had (including my expired id). He told me he could not accept my id because arizona laws are very strict... I explained the situation and told him its a goverment issued id, but he didn't budge. this was the only place who even questioned it.  Obviously, not a good experience.

This is a really unique and cool bar in one of the newest casinos in Vegas.  3 levels, and plenty of room.  Wasn't very crowded (I was there in the afternoon) and our waitress was enjoyable.  Their cocktail menu has a lot of random concoctions and something new for everyone.  Give it a try next time your in Vegas!

I'm really trying to limit the amount of 5 star reviews i give. I think my problem stems from the fact that i'm easy to please with food. Never in a million years did i think i'd be giving a place like this 5 stars... but here we are. Here's the haps: This is a random little open bar/restaurant in the Cosmopolitan in Vegas. You've been to or seen a million of these kinds of places and they're generally okay for a quick bite. I got in late for a work trip so i decided to stop by. I happened to be the only person sitting at the bar. The bartender handed me a menu and grabbed a drink order. The menu isn't huge... but just like every other little open bar in vegas they do breakfast, lunch and dinner all day. The bartender recommended a burger so i went with that. Their burgers are a create-your-own style and you get to choose 3 special items to go on there. Feeling a little crazy, i did bacon, avocado and a friend egg. No cheese? Whats wrong with me??  Cue the black and white 1950's gangster movie scene: The bartender comes over, starts hand-drying some dishes and says "so what's getting to you boss?" As he sets my whiskey down in front of me. This was pretty hilarious as this literally was a scene out of a movie. Anyway... I can't even describe to you the amazingness of this burger. I would have given this place 5 stars had i had this burger and had to fight a thousand rats to get to it. Not only was it the best burger I've ever had, i literally had a dream about it recently. This is the worlds only 6 star burger. I don't even remember what side it came with, because i couldn't care less. Everything i did that day became absolutely obsolete. The egg was fried perfectly. The bacon was crispy and fresh. The avocado was half of the most perfectly ripe avocado ever served. The burger itself was fantastically medium well (don't kill me but i love it). The bun was slightly toasted just enough so it had a crunch. Need i go on?

Okay how has this place not caught on everywhere? I was there for about 3 hours, spent about 40 bucks and didn't even drink! They have tons of games that were fun only for nostalgic reasons and many others that are new that I have never played. Everything from old Tron arcade games to new xbox games played on big ol' HDTVs.  They also have the whole bar cut off into sections.  Obviously there is the bar. It is huge with plenty of room to sit and play some of your favorite games while you grab a drink. Then they have private areas you can rent and play everything from the newest Mortal Kombat to the original Zelda game. Then the back of the bar is more of a "club" atmosphere with a dance floor, DJ booth and plenty of blinking and flashing lights for your seizure pleasure. Last but not least is my favorite, an art wall. The art is all video game related and is all for sale. There is something for everyone here and it certainly gives you a break from the normal night in Vegas!

This is tough to give 2 stars to. I honestly think that if it wasn't so outrageously expensive, It would have 3. Yes I know, it's in Vegas and Vegas is expensive. But the Denny's style menu (breakfast lunch and dinner all day) just shouldn't be that much.  After much debate between the make-your-own omelette or the french dip... I went with the french dip. It was big. Maybe too big. I'd almost describe it as I had some bread with my meat. The sandwich itself wasn't bad. It was soaking wet with grease which was disappointing, but the quality was pretty good. The sauce (they do it with gravy instead of au jus) was waaaay too salty. Had they toned it down on the salt, it would have been a lot better. The saving grace were the fries. They were really quite good.  It's the noise level got a little obnoxious. I know its Vegas, but between the casino and the amount of employees yelling across the restaurant, it was a little much. With the big menu and the convenience of being located in MGM, it may be worth a shot. However, get out your wallets... my french dip was $20. Ouch.

Are you kidding me? This place is real?  Of course it has a million reviews and 5 stars. There is something for every single person on this planet to enjoy. When the worker found out I had never been there, she mentioned that they make over 400 sandwiches. Four. Hundred. Holy. Crap.  They have tons of vegetarian options, plenty of unique combos and then the basic stuff as well. If theres one thing (okay, theres many) that Adam Richman has taught me, its that the basic dish is the best way to judge a restaurant. Yes, I went with the boring turkey avocado.  The lady working there recommended a crunchy bread and had my sandwich out to me in less than 3 minutes. First... it was the size of my head. Massive amounts of food is a big plus in my book.  The sandwich itself was great. Perfect ratio of meat, bread and lettuce. And the avocado was fresh. None of that crazy bottled crap.  My only regret is that I didn't get it "dirty". They'll put mozzarella sticks and jalape√±o poppers on it. Oh. My. Heck.
