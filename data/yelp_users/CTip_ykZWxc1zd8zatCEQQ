My husband and I visited Binkley's during restaurant week. It was absolutely amazing. I know the price we paid was well below what their typical dinner goes for, but they treated us like we were their most important customers. They really got the spirit behind restaurant week and showed off their skills.  Service was amazing, the food was incredible, and wine was excellent as well. The restaurant week menu had 3 main courses - the pork cheek was my fav. And between those main courses we received a bunch of "amuse bouche" small bites of food to excite our palettes. Every bite was amazing. We will definitely come back for special occasions! This was the best meal we've ever had in AZ.

I do not understand all of the good reviews for this place. The ginger chicken bowl was dry and bland except for the ginger sauce which tasted like it came from a can. It had a distinct Metallic taste. The miso soup was so salty you could barely taste any miso flavor at all. The only semi-decent thing was the hot sauce. And the rice was edible. I will not be coming back.

I had the Beach Burger today and my husband had the Parmaseanna Burger. Best burgers we've ever had for $7.00. They were seriously yummy!   We also tried the french toast fries... more like a dessert than like fries. Still really interesting and tasty, but I'd only recommend them for someone who has a serious sweet tooth.

This was a fantastic dinner. Bone-in ribeye, beef Wellington, beet root salad, onion ale soup, and topped it off with sticky toffee pudding. The service was also amazing. Dennis and Mohamadu were great!

I have had my nails done by Mike twice now. Both were fantastic. The salon is clean, the massage chairs are new, and I never feel rushed through even though this place is usually busy. I recommend getting an appointment before you show up, especially during busy times. They always have customers!
