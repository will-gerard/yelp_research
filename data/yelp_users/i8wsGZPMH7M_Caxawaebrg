Great experience here. Jeff helped me out, I called in only 2 hours before closing and they said they would squeeze me in for an alignment. I headed over, after waiting a bit because they were busy (understandably) they took a look at my car. Unfortunately  the pulling of my car to the right was unable to be fixed but this was out of their control. They did their best to align my car and when he figured out he couldn't, they fixed it so it wouldn't put extra wear on my tires. After all that, they didn't even charge me because they couldn't fix the pulling! What a great experience! That says a lot coming from somebody who usually is very apprehensive of car repair shops especially because I am a girl, so I feel like they usually want to take advantage of me! Jeff was very friendly and I would definitely recommend this shop to everybody I know! I'll be back!

Great place, this was my first time at this location but seemed similar to the other two. Great place for good beer and food.

I would give zero stars if possible. This pool company will claim they came out to service your pool when they never even stopped by the house. We were stuck with this pool company because of our rental company and we weren't able to use our pool all last summer because it turned green every week because they don't do their job. To top it off they can't even manage to return your phone calls. I found out through our rental company that 90% of the pools serviced by this company are green. Invitations Homes has since changed their pool service and thank goodness! We can hopefully use our pool this summer.

Initially I had high hopes, they had a groupon and their availability seemed good, so I went ahead and scheduled an appointment. Friday at 1 September 4th for an interior detailing.   Then he wanted to come at 12:30 instead, no problem I said.  On Sept. 4th He needed to cancel because the person scheduled to clean my car was sick. Ok I get it things happen and he offered to throw in an exterior wash. No big deal lets try again.   Scheduled Sept. 9th at 4:30.   On Sept 9th - He wanted to reschedule to earlier. At this point I feel things are getting a little out of hand with the rescheduling but I go with it because I really want my car cleaned. So 1:30 it is.  -Next email is again the worker that was scheduled to clean my car has called out sick. At this point I can't help but think something is wrong with this business but Derrick now says he is going to come out to do it himself so I again go along with it.  We work a bit on when he should come out but I don't feel like I'm a priority even after all the rescheduling they did on their part. But again I really want my car cleaned so I try to be flexible.   Scheduled with Derrick Sept 13th @ 10:30  - he mentioned this would be a good time because he only has one other car scheduled at 7:30. So again I'm hopeful. The business owner is coming out to do it himself and it looks like they aren't overbooking themselves.  Sept 13th 10:30  comes and goes with no communication from them. So 20 minutes after he is scheduled to arrive,  I contact him.  They are running late but on their way.  Then I get another email, "it might be a little later, how late is the car there?"   ok first off he was on the way when he said he was, what is this new delay?  So I emailed back and asked how late and what was causing the delay.   No Response.   They just never showed up.  I have been in contact with Derrick multiple times regarding my refund. It is now a month after I originally scheduled with them, my car was never cleaned and I am STILL waiting on them to process my refund.
