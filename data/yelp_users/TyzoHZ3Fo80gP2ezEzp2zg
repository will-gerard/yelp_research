A mild mannered gentleman and his wife run this low key, cute restaurant.   Quick service and generous portions of the dinner bento boxes keep me coming back. It is nice to see them at the popular Matsuri festival in Phoenix  every year.

I have periodically visited Saigon Pho on Alma School for the last four years.  Today, our visit was disappointing.   When I asked our server to please use a clean wok when preparing my meal due to my nuts allergies, she seemed to be offended by my request. ( I've asked on prior visits with no problems.)I was made to feel, by this server, that they have high sanitation standards.  As much as I was hoping this was true,  my friend's spoon for the iced coffee had arrived with dried cilantro baked to it.   My other companion's Pho bowl had come with dried dark sauce on the exterior.  Mmmmm, not my idea of clean.  The server was sarcastic but we were there to have a nice dinner.  My entree tasted okay but the meat was chewy and cold.  The rest of my foodie group enjoyed their dishes but now I will just stick to Cyclo and Chandler Pho for my Vietnamese cravings and pleasant service.

I had super quick eye pad replacementsjob done on my Maui Jim sunglasses.  I didn't buy the glasses at his store, (they were a gift) but the kind gentleman wouldn't charge me for his service.  (They are a Maui Jim authorized dealer and repair shop.)   I will keep them in mind for my future eyeglass purchases and service!

Monday, Jodi and I had a delicious brunch and super service at Mimi's Cafe.  The Sante Fe Omelette came with a smoky, chipotle sauce that had a punch to it!  The heat hits your taste buds 5-10 seconds after you've put a spoonful in your mouth!  The roasted, quarter sized, seasoned potatoes are served piping hot............just the way I like them!  Heck, I liked them better than the eggs!  For a sweet treat, we ordered the orange creme French toast.  A bit pricey at $8.69 for just two pieces of brioche but with the orange marmalade/cream cheese filling............for me, it is always worth it!   This item is one of my favorite calorie splurges!  Our meal was topped off with very nice and efficient service from our server, Lisa.  Go to head to the gym now........!

What happened to one of my favorite dishes !?  The turkey bacon brie mushroom crepes were awful today!  To start, the dish was served not warm and came out looking like there was a stiff layer of glue on top of the crepe that didn't even move when you shook the plate.  The turkey inside was fine but looking and tasting the cold, gelified brie cheese sauce was not good.  I would have brought it to the server's attention but I was not with regular company (didn't want to embarrass her) and I was not footing the bill.  I know,  I shouldn't complain so loudly  since I didn't give Mimi's  a chance to correct it but I've had this entree before and it has been lovely.  So good that I ordered it again.  I will still patronize Mimi's Cafe for they have many great dishes to pick from, I just won't order the turkey bacon brie mushroom crepes next time!

Again, I had great customer service at Walt's Jewellers.   Prompt, efficient and reasonable watch services keep me coming back!  I notice the same friendly staff is present which shows me that there isn't a high turn over of employees.  I like that!

Spent a wonderful day here!   This second time around was better than the first time. The  "Aji Kolada" was super with the fresh toasted coconut on top.  It was more like a slushy dessert than a drink!  The mini facial experience was relaxing and had all the essential treatments included.  With the use of their amenities available .... steam room , sauna, jacuzzi and pool we spent many hours here.  The radiccio salad was a gratifying lunch.....more so than the lettuce cups, which I ordered on my visit four months ago.  Great, efficient and  friendly service today!  I will be returning. (I had to edit this review to add photos.  :) )

New ownership as of July 2015!  Awesome authentic Chinese cuisine!  They offer tripe and pigs ear  but we ordered four other entrees.  The scallion lamb was delicious as the Mongolian beef.  Fresh noodles in the chow mein and the chicken fried rice was made with fresh rice.  Not day old like the traditional.. I don't know if they ran out of old rice but it was a tasty and fluffy yet not clumpy-like when you usually use fresh rice.  :)  (The new owners should have changed the restaurant name so patrons won't think it is the awful House of Egg Roll months prior.  Just thought I'd put it out there!) ------------------------------- Having liked this new business so much we ordered the  exact same dishes but had a very different outcome this time.  Three out of the four dishes were very oily and much saltier than the dishes at our inaugural  visit.  The fried rice was the only eatable one. I understand Chinese food sometimes is on the strong salt side but the chef was over enthusiastic when seasoning our entrees this time.  The other two people confided in me that they won't be returning.   I may give it another chance sometime......

CUSTOMERS BEWARE!    This  place added a tip on our take out credit card slip without our authorization!   I contacted our credit card company and they put our charge "in suspension" while  they looked into this issue.  Two days late, I received  a phone call from House of Egg Roll saying they were sorry and admitted to charging a different amount than what we had signed for.  I wonder how many other customers they have been skimming off of?  After this third visit, we will NOT be returning!!!

The rib eye steak was the winner dish tonight!    The AZ restaurant specials were a great deal to take advantage of.  I actually ordered from the Ruth Chris classic menu where for $43.95, I had more choices to pick from.  The filet and shrimp were good while the chicken tortellini soup was wonderful.  They must have just added fresh mushrooms to their homemade broth prior to serving, for all the elements were perfectly done, not mushy.  I was also pleasantly surprised by their white chocolate raspberry cheesecake with almond bark.  Ken provided us with great service not, stuffy like I had been forewarned.  Very good experience had here!

This colorful decorated spot has a fun vibe to it!  The house enchiladas were okay as their skinny margarita.  (I was fairly warned by the server that this "skinny drink" may be "skinny" on flavor as well.  )  The complimentary chips were fair but the salsa was good.  Service turned more hospitable towards the latter half of our meal.

Hard to beat!  This is still my favorite place to have a wonderful dining experience, six years running. I think this extraordinary restaurant is exceptional with its tasting menu. Our  past dinners have been escalated by the complimentary chef "tasters" that arrive in between our ordered items.  The service we experienced last visit would come in second to service at the Kai but Binkley's cuisine is still at the top of my list for my special occasions out!

From a recommendation of a friend, we tried Butterfield's Pancake House.  We arrived  with high expectations and weren't disappointed.  There was a bit a wait but is worth while if you have the time.   The Wildberry Bliss CrÃªpe for $ 8.95 satisfied my craving!  This french crepe stuffed with wildberry mascarpone, topped with vanilla cream, fresh wildberries & glaze is sweet and rich.  No low cal here!  The only mishap was after I informed my server that I have a nut allergy,  specifically ordered a dish that did not contain nuts and after being reassured by the server that  I could indulge in this dish, my crepes arrived with a couple of pecans on the side of my crepe.  "They must have fallen off another dish while in the kitchen", was my only reply.  Good thing my girlfriend and I saw it for I would have had to deal with an allergic reaction from this  slip up!!!  I forgot to mention that my Nancy M. enjoyed their gluten free pancakes.

Great food, good prices.  The tasty food reminds me of the cuisine I get when in Vancouver, B.C. on the west coast of Canada.  Service- a tad slow but the place is good when you're not on a time limit.  Wonton noodle soup - just okay-five wonton come in a light broth with lots of noodles.  The soft tofu with beef over rice is tasty as is the beef chow fun. The  Kung pow is delicious too!   A nice surprise was the iced red bean drink.  Served cold and sweet, this drink is refreshing and filling with the generous amount of red beans!  At $2.50 it is a deal!  We fought over who would take the last bit!

I dined here for dinner on a busy Friday night recently and was very disappointed.  The usual fresh spareribs in black bean sauce was not so fresh, their beef and bitter melon was so greasy, that you could see a shiny layer of oil floating on top.  I enter Chinese restaurants with the understanding that I will be indulging happily in high calorie meal but when your dish displays a separated layer of oil, it makes you lose your enthusiasm. For the third dish, the steamed chicken was tasty, accompanied with the wonderfully pungent garlic/ginger side.  I hope to write a better review next time...............I'll pack some Rolaid's.  ;)

Great natural  outdoor setting with tables inside and out.  Casual diner like setting.  Gooey, tasty grilled cheese.  (Hard not to screw grilled fatty cheese!) Onion rings were crisp and tasty.......just missing tartar sauce.  (They only offer it on Fridays with their fish.) This British Columbian gal understands that it is  not a tradition in AZ to  serve tartar sauce with onion rings.  Nevertheless, I make my own with the relish, mayo and lemon juice they have in the restaurant kitchen to suffice!  ;). Once you try an onion ring with a creamy, tangy tartar sauce, it is hard to go without!

Our second time here.  This time, the miso soup and salad did not make a good start to this meal.  The miso soup was overly salty (this is sometimes due to keeping the soup over 48 hours-it happens to me at home)  and the salad dressing on the salad had a burnt taste to it.  All four persons at our table noticed this.  The tofu dome sushi roll was a tasty, filled with tofu, imitation crab and avocado.  It is a shame that the pork katsu was over done and dry for it was very good our last visit.  The gyoza was oily and lacked flavor.  The service was friendly so we tipped well for that but the food was not at par this time around.

Being first time visitors here, we weren't sure what to expect.  We stopped by the Olive Mill in Queen Creek yesterday for lunch and were pleasantly surprised!   A large boutique filled with items and foods from local companies and artists.   Dishware, nut butters, chocolates, wines and of course olive oils and vinegars are on display to purchase.   Try sampling their Bacon olive oil, chocolate olive oil and  strawberry balsamic vinegar! ) Lunch and dinner menus,  gelato bar, speciality coffee bar, beers on tap and a dessert counter show their variety of foods they offer.  We were pleased with  our bruschetta bread choices.  Chardonnay Herb Mascarpone, green apple,  Melted Gorgonzola, Genoa salami with Extra Virgin Olive Oil  and the  Burnt mozzarella, Pesto.  The Mascarone was overloaded but the gorgonzola was perfect for me!  The florentine and bacon salad had a wonderful dressing  but a tad to much d for the spinach at the bottom went a a bit limp before I could enjoy it.  The salad  did have a very generous helping of bacon and crisp grapes  that gave it  texture to save it!  Nice roasted garlic on top as well.  The Olive Mill also has a skin care line that is made right on the premises.  I look forward to trying some of those items as well as their soups and other next time I visit!

I tried one of the two new broth bowls Paradise is promoting.  The lentil quinoa bowl was just okay tasting and even with the egg prepared just right, I still wouldn't pay .......get this........$8.19 for it again!  Yikes!  When did Paradise Bakery move their prices into the table service level?  In my opinion, this smaller serving of a meal in their soup department does not warrant the price.

My Vietnamese friend and I first tried the specialty Ban Mam fish based soup. The broth was salty but tasty.  Nice pieces of white fish and a few thinly sliced meat topped the noodles.  My  companion said the traditional piece of squid was missing though. Next The Tom Bun arrived.  Grilled shrimp accompanied by freshly shredded greens topped this dry noodle dish.  With the side of julienned pork we ordered, this entree was great!  In fact the pork with its special sauce would have been great on anything!   Even though the staff made the mistake of bringing us the wrong dish the first time, they were apologetic and friendly.  Clean tables, clean dishware were impressive.  The last Vietnamese spot I dined at did not present its self well in the sanitation department.  :)  We had a good experience yesterday and UnPhogettable is on my "will visit again list!"

I had a very good experience at Posh.  When making reservations I was kindly asked if I wanted their parking details emailed to me.  This made it a breeze knowing ahead of time that they have reserved parking and complimentary valet in the parking garage directly below their establishment.  With the improvisational menu, you cross off on the list which meats you DO NOT want to partake in.  Since kangaroo was not currently being offered, I selected the venison, quail and goose for the entries of my five course meal.    To start, the amuse bouche was a delightful daikon topped with fish eggs, drizzled with a bonito glaze.  The tomato based soup was okay but the butter cardamon fused butter that accompanied the rolls were a knock out!  My venison that arrived stuffed inside a sausage casing had a complimentary glaze that was tasty but the meat was unfortunately dry on the inside. The side of cauliflower was charred nicely, though.  The grilled quail was the bomb perfect in every way!  Being the fatter side of the quail, it was well marbled and delicious - served in a sweet glaze!  My husband paid for the upgrade of $20.00 for the Kobe beef which was great!  Just a bit too much salt rub on the outside, was the only complaint on this item. My goose was good and not gamy tasting but just a tad chewy.  I can handle that! For dessert, the chocolate flour less cake served with chocolate sorbet and paper thin chocolate leaf ended the meal on a high note for moi!   The only draw back would be the wine.  The glass I was served didn't taste as fresh as I had hoped for.  I left Posh feeling pretty full with just the five course tasting meal.  (And I'm know amongst my friends as "the petite gal that can eat!"    I'm looking forward to another wonderful dining experience when I return to Posh!

I was not disappointed with my second visit to India Oven.  Good service, great quality for a buffet at a very reasonable price.  It is a bargain at $10.95 for an adult dinner buffet that includes mango lassie, dessert and Indian tea.   Meat entrees like lamb vindaloo, tikki masala,  vegetarian dishes, salad and desserts are there for you to choose from.  This buffet is a wonderful way for children or others who are interested in sampling a variety of Indian dishes at one sitting!

I was pleased with our first visit to this family run restaurant.  After reading many Yelp reviews, I went in with an open mind and lowered my expectations.  I wouldn't be a fair judge of Peruvian food, for this was my first time but it was tasty a good dining experience!   My Aji De Gallin was smooth and creamy with generous pieces of chicken.  8/10.  Flavorful but small portion was the Lomo Saltado De Carne.  It had tender beef and a delicious sauce.  9/10.  The tofu and vegetarian versions were also good, very salty but came with an abundant of onions, peppers and other veggies.  The Chicha Morada, a chilled beverage made from purple corn was refreshing, not too sweet and rounded out our meal.  I'd visit again!

After having read the AZ critic's review of a particular dish at this restaurant, I had to try it. The fish sausage dish was soggy but the sauce was fabulous!   I ate every last vegetable that accompanied the fish/sausage just to sop up more of this tasty sauce!  The Chow fun was just run of the mill but okay.

My second time here.  I visited this spot for lunch on Thursday and loved the Lasagna roll.  Mixed tempura was done nicely with the batter light and crisp.  Kate did mention the cucumbers in the sunomono salad were not crunchy like fresh ones would be.   The polite gentleman server was prompt, courteous and attentive!

The gal who took my order through the drive through was very friendly.  Perky even!  The dark haired, second employee I encountered, , at the window,  (7:39 am)didn't have her mornings coffee! When she recited my order to me, I politely said  it was incorrect.  She didn't apologize and was very, very dry with her attitude.   The vehicle behind me also waited a long time for her order.

First time visiting this cafe yesterday.   Very similar to the Paradise Bakery chain.  Kneader's Bakery had friendly servers this day.  Great tasting chocolate macaroons!  Fresh, moist and chocolaty!   The strawberry tsunami smoothie was just okay.  I will stop by again to try their meals.

I love the concept of creating your own personalized donut.  They cook to order the donut, which is the good old fashioned heavy dough, then you select your glaze, then your topping!  Voila!  Your hot, fresh treat is ready to eat!  The staff is very friendly to boot!

It is nice to have a healthy alternative to eat at. Last week when I was having lunch, the line to order moved quickly and the service was friendly.  Even though my beef bowl was not too full,  it made for a filling lunch.   With the pretty, feminine, colorful interior design, I was impressed with seeing a handful of male patrons there.  (Just my opinion.  ;)  )

I'm so lucky to have discovered this hidden gem!  Serving freshly made lunch and breakfast items, this friendly, owner operated/on staff establishment rates a five star on my score card.  In fact, every staff member was peppy and courteous!  The Green Goddess grilled cheese I ordered  was delicious with its spinach, avocado, herb spread and mozzarella.  The kale slaw with green onions, napa cabbage, feta cheese was also fresh and tasty.  I will be visiting Graz kitchen fresh again!

A unique coffee shoppe with a good vibe!  Even though this place was busy the barrista created my cortado coffee with confidence and artistic detail.  This cortado was not my usual drink but with having a larger menu than your basic coffee houses, I figured why not branch out?  I love to try something new!  The cortado arrived with two shots of espresso with warm milk. Not hot, like the staff warned me prior. It was so beautifully done, I need to take a photo before I enjoyed it.  The pour over or chemex is net for me to try!

I honestly feel bad about about giving this cafe only two stars today.  The service was prompt, friendly and efficient but the food was not.  My Kale and Quinoa salad which was made with blueberries, grapes, parmesan cheese, cherries and nuts was tossed nicely but with a tasteless dressing.  The Yucatan Chicken Tortilla soup had a tasty broth but was a tad salty.  One of my diing partners ordered the Lobster Bisque and was turned off by the saltiness of the soup.  She paid for croutons as an extra, tried adding extra crackers to balance the soup but she still could not enjoy it.  The kitchen staff kindly gave sour cream to blend in but that didn't work.  She sampled the New England Clam Chowder but that too had an off the chart salt reading.  She ended up ordering the Crab Avocado Melt instead and the kind staff brought it to our table no charge.  That's great service!  I have dined at the Camelback location and had wonderful experiences.  Perhaps it could be that this location just opened up earlier this month and needs time to get things down pat.   I will return to Cafe Zupas for they usually serve up wonderful meals.  I'll give it a few months.  :)
