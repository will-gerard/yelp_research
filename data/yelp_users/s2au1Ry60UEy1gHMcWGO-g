Ordered food from this site around 9:30, restaurant completely closed, never received any order, nobody called to let us know what was going on.  restaurant showed up as "Asian dining" on grub hub, which made it harder to find here.  Grub hub confirms that restaurant acknowledged the order, just vanished into thin air, I guess.  Points to grub hub for compensating for this mistake, still doesn't help us get fed tonight.

A 15 minute wait to drive through window pretty much invalidates your status as "fast food" I could have been served at a sit down restaurant and be done eating by now.

I called several clinics in the area and came here because after asking what their rates were to be seen they were the ones who quoted me the lowest price. It was something shockingly low like under $20. Now I get here and they're telling me it's over 200. Guess I'm leaving and going to the next place that was on my list.  I just need a damn prescription written. I want somebody to put words on paper that I'm going to pay money for somewhere else. That doesn't cost $200 plus

If I could give less than one star, I gladly would.  Any time I've had to visit this office, we've been made to wait in excess of three hours.  five seems more typical.  They could look to the DMV for a better model of efficiency.  I cannot imagine how they don't have more people staffing the windows: They're paying so many out of work people anyways, you'd think they could just hire three or four.  Since they lost the information we watched them make photocopies of, personally...  Twice...  I've had a case closed on me, and in the course of reapplying was told to come back in since I can't seem to sign up for the NEW website online.  I work nights, do I have 5 hours to spend during daytime hours sitting in a chair getting sick?  The last person I spoke to on the phone said their system had been down for five days, but half an hour earlier I was able to get the password for my new account ...  I had to call back because they didn't give me a USERNAME with it.  The lady I spoke to who was telling me that it was down then transferred me to an automated message telling me that the system was down, which then hung up on me. I'm a genius, and I've had over a month, maybe as much as two, invested in trying to get us insurance through the state.  I CANNOT imagine how people too stupid to qualify for jobs manage to navigate this system.  Is there a cottage industry of lawyers or squatters who sit in the office to wait in your place, professionally?  Should I call up and tell them that I like lamp, and wait for them to get me some mental retardation assistant who can walk me through this? Just another example of horrific government bureaucratic nightmare.  What the HELL?

I cannot imagine how at noon in uptown Scottsdale this place still has no line and reasonable prices. How is this still an undiscovered treasure?
