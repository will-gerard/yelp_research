This is an exception Indian restaurant! My fiance use to deliver clay ovens to all the Indian restaurants in the valley and said this place had the cleanest back of house! The service and food are great! I've been here for dinner several times and my go to meal is shrimp korma, basmati rice, garlic naan, and a mango lassi to drink. I can't wait to try the lunch buffet sometime!

I purchased a groupon for $15 for 1 month unlimited yoga, after 1 class I called groupon and had my money refunded. The yoga studio smelled like sweaty socks, it was unbearable! The instructor said the carpet was just washed the previous night. Yikes! I recommend Sumits North Phoenix instead!

After seeing this restaurant on Check Please Arizona, I was so excited to go here.. The inside of the restaurant is very nice looking but the food was not good! We ordered a chicken caesar salad it was so bland we sent it back. Our main dishes were nothing special and the tiramisu is also tasteless. I was pretty disappointed and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone based off the food. I will not be returning.

I've been here a few times and I think it's safe to say I absolutely love this place! I really like how the crowd is so diverse with people ranging from their 20s - 60s+ so I can come here with my girlfriends or my parents! Karaoke is so much fun and the crowd is always super friendly. I recommend trying the chicken wings, they are HUGE and delicious. I feel the drinks are reasonably priced and the service is good. Always a good time here!!! Also - no cover!

This is a great nail salon!! The staff is soo sweet & friendly and the atmosphere is great. They either are playing a movie or good music on the TV which I like. The salon is very clean and well kept. They give a hand & back massage with your nail service that goes above & beyond the norm! The only reason I deducted 1 star is bc whatever brand of gel polish they use does not last well on my nails and chips fast, so I don't get a gel mani here anymore. Other than that this place is wonderful!

This is mine & my family's favorite sushi establishment! It's owned and run by the sweetest family! The sushi is always fresh and delicious. I recommend the ice green tea, it's great! The sunshine roll and sashimi are the standouts here. You won't be disappointed.

This is by FAR my fav place to get lunch when I was working in Chandler. I usually order a combo with 2 meats, jerk fried rice, black beans, and it comes with a delicious warm snickerdoodle cookie!! The portions are quite large. The staff is so friendly and if you call in for take out they prepare the food super quick! One time I forgot to call ahead and just stopped in on my lunch break, they were quite busy and said it would be a long wait to get my food but I told them I was on my lunch break at work and they rushed it for me!! :) absolutely love this place!! The food is great, I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quick affordable lunch!

This is my go to spot for a romantic sushi dinner! The atmosphere & ambiance of this place is great, the decor is beautiful. The sushi is fresh & delicious, I am only giving 4 stars though because the service is slow,

So far this is my go-to wing place in Phoenix.. The lemon pepper wings are the best!! And their blue cheese is so good, you can buy it by the pound. I like to get take out, have not eaten inside yet.

An afforable luxury that every woman can enjoy! I had seen Drybar in NYC and had been wanting to go. I purchased a groupon deal and could not be happier. The decor is lovely, so cute & adorable! As soon as I walked in I was greated with a warm smile and offered a mimosa.... HEAVEN. My blowout was great and I will deff be returning!!

I purchased a groupon for eyebrow threading for this place and I am so happy I did! This is a great clean place & the people are super friendly! $8 for eyebrow threading is a decent price, most places have higher prices. In NJ I use to get my eyebrows threaded for $3-$4 but I have not been able to find a place that does it that cheap in AZ, so far this business is the best I have found here!

I am so glad there is finally a noodles & co in AZ! I've been to locations in NJ & CO and I'm obsessed! $6 buys me a small pasta and side soup with is a perfect portion for me. I highly recommend the Alfredo, penne rosa, and tomato basil soup!
