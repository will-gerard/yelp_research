This very simple shop is owned by a married couple who tend to know all their regulars, what they order and how they order it.  Mostly sandwiches and salads (although they do serve coffees/espresso as well), the food is simple and wonderful. I always order the Ariete which is proscuitto, fresh mozz, fresh basil, on a wonderful crunchy Italian bread.  My husband usually gets the Leone (imported ham) or the Pesce, which is tuna, red onion, olive oil and a good shaving of pecorino on foccacia.  They serve a small cup (literally) of spring greens dressed in balsamic, that always looks funny to me, but end up being a perfect compliment to your sandwich.  All breads, pastries, and foccacia style pizzas are baked fresh every a.m.  Don't go too late in the afternoon, or you'll find yourself without.  Closed Mondays

Great music playing on the radio. Took my soon to be 2nd grader for an afternoon of pizza, ice cream, Frogger, Donkey Kong, Ms. Pac Man, Galaga etc.  The food is not stellar, but it's reasonably priced.  They do have beer here as well.  I'm sure we'll be back with the kids in tow.  Mostly a younger crowd at lunch time.  The place is definitely divey, but it was pretty spotless.  People working are nice as well.  Don't miss out on the 50 cent ice cream cones either.

Roaring Fork is running their happy hour from 4 - 10 p.m. all summer long.  I hadn't been in since Robert McGrath sold the restaurant, and was in the bar two nights last week.  I had the green chili pork which still rocks.  The service was fantastic the first night.  Couldn't make a complaint even if I was in a horrible mood and looking to.  The second night, our server was unable to take our food and drink order (in the bar) at the same time. That being said, they haven't changed the menu or tried to cut any corners on quality since McGrath left.   I'll definitely be in soon again.

Incredible place. Don't be afraid to bring your car here. Even as a woman.  Ask for JP or Scotty. Fab.

So, we went on the busiest day of the week, Sunday. We didn't follow our friends' suggestions (Eggs Maximilian and Eggs Benedict). And, sadly, we weren't impressed.  First off, protect yourself in the parking lot. It's reminiscent of Death Race with people cruising around the parking lot in strange contorted circles, trying to guess where the exiting 4-top has parked in order to get into position.  My husband was waiting for a place (as in already stationary) when a woman in VW backed up several cars and expected him to move.  She was lovely. . . like jumping cholla is lovely that is.  The staff are definitely friendly.  One of the servers dropped a plastic roach on my menu for my 3 year old while I was holding him.  How was he to know that I am unreasonably afraid/disgusted by them?  He was trying to be nice.  It looked so real that the kids were afraid to touch it and instead tried to use my hand to prod it to see if it would move.  Luckily, when our server came to take our order, the roach stayed inside the menu and would be a surprise for some future diner. (No, I do not feel bad about that.)   Between the four of us, we ordered The Cisco (french toast/eggs/bacon combo), eggs and Canadian bacon, and Huevos Rancheros with both the green chili and red salsa.  The french toast came out hot and was decent, scrambled eggs were fine, and bacon crispy.  The Huevos was next.  Big disappointment. Beans were nearly cold, the green chili was just warm, eggs were cooked perfectly, but the plate just didn't do anything for us.  The green chili was very unremarkable. (Tortilla was good.)  The Canadian bacon was the roughest piece of CB I've ever seen, gristle around the edge and fat.  The eggs on the Canadian bacon plate were ordered over easy, but served over hard.  Coffee is weak. I'd have to say I like the bacon best which was crispy and thick.   I think my expectations were way too high for this place.  That being said, my husband had no expectations, and he said he wouldn't bother to go back.  If you go - maybe stick with the Eggs Max with chorizo.  That seems to be the #1 hit.  And watch yourself in the parking lot!

Today was my first trip to Essence. I've had their famous macaroons at Old Town Farmer's Market, and while I think calling them macaroons is misleading to a gal who's used to a sticky stack of coconut, they are like crack.  There was a line out the door.  Luckily, a few of the patrons waiting in line mentioned they were waiting solely to pick up also famous croissants that were well publicized last weekend.  So after a few false starts (I walked in and asked if I had to wait in line to order, and was told yes) another employee handing out something that looked like donut-holes (I didn't get one) told me I could go to the second register and place my order for breakfast. So after 15 or so confusing minutes, we had our order placed very quickly and were seated - all eight of us - in their pretty small space.  Our food took quite awhile to come out, but it was hot, and servers were very pleasant (and nice to our kids).  Although I had had no expectations, I was quite happy with my single latte.  Breakfast sandwiches were good quality, good ingredients, Dubliner, peppered bacon, Tim's ham, but not inspiring. Two people in our party ordered the french toast and a few gave them rave reviews.  Another didn't care for the banana peanut syrup.  (I agreed that I'd rather try it on chicken.)  My vegan, allergic to lots of stuff niece, loved hot her breakfast cereal with organic soy milk, pecans and fresh fruit.  Mom had the eggs and sausage, and gave it a solid thumbs up.    They use great ingredients here, and it shows.  I wouldn't say there was anything mind blowing that we had on the breakfast menu.  We didn't experience anything for breakfast that measures up to the crack-like, cult status of the macaroon and croissant, but I'll definitely be back.  I think for lunch next time.  Also, you  might avoid this place for the next week or so until the croissant hype dies off a bit.  We told two different parties that were about to leave, that they didn't have to stand in line for breakfast.  We also couldn't order croissants since we were sitting and eating, and not standing in line. That was a bummer.

So, we've used Roto-Rooter in the past.  Who hasn't?  Today we called Roto-Rooter to handle a leaky master bathroom shower.  My husband figured a washer needed to be replaced, and was sorry he couldn't make it over to do it himself.  Must be slow right now. . . I got a call with an estimate saying the entire valve needed to be replaced and the total would be $325.  When I said, "Huh? My husband thought it was just the washer." I got back in response, well, it's an old house, when we get in there, yada, yada, yada, better to just replace it all.  So after alerting the hub, he called to find out what the guy was talking about and got a different reply. . "I'm sure it will be less than that, we'll let you know how it goes."  Fail. Beware of gender abuse.

So. . . I think the name is very misleading. I have thought about stopping in before, but I also thought this place was a deli counter with the usual sandwiches and a little ice cream. I would have been surprised.  My sister talked me into trying it out for a quick bite before our Thursday night class.  This place is like a neighborhood pub should be.  The wood bar is warm and inviting. The Side Door is small - very small.  Even though this is obviously a neighborhood joint, we didn't feel uncomfortable grabbing a table. For every 70-something that was at a table, there was  a 20-something at the bar.  The food was not amazing but it was decent and reasonably priced.  We split a Greek salad and a roasted veggie pizza.  The veggies were great, the crust, nothing to write home about, but could repeat.  I want to come back and try some of the sandwiches.  Somehow I have a feeling the Italian beef would be a hit. . .

We went last night to check out the Yelp Eats menu, and as Camille mentioned, nearly everything is available.  There are about 8 options for all three courses.    I was tempted to get the escargot, as they changed the preparation from the last time we were there, but our waiter, Trevor, suggested I go with the cucumber soup as that was my other choice.  The cucumber soup was cold, creamy and delicious with a substantial amount of crab meat in it along with caviar.  It was refreshing, and I'd definitely re-order.  For the second course, I had the steak frites and husband ordered the croque madame.  The steak was well cooked, juicy and not a tad overdone.  We shared the large portion of frites, and husband definitely enjoyed the croque which was served on thick brioche.  For dessert, Trevor suggested the banana option, but since I'm not a big fan, we told him we were thinking about beignets or the blueberry galette.  His suggestion - the blueberry galette is seasonal and won't be around for too long, try it.  We were very glad we took his advice. My first comment to my husband was, "That looks nothing like a galette."  It didn't matter, the pastry and blueberries were still warm, topped by vanilla truffle ice cream and drizzled with lavender honey.  I don't think we put our forks down until it was gone.  I give that dessert 5 stars.  The only odd thing about our meal was the pickled okra in the bloody marys.  We've had marys there before and really liked them.  The okra just started to ooze a gelatinous substance after biting off the bottom.  I have to say it was a little off-putting. I don't know if we just haven't had enough okra in our lives, but my husband only drank half of his. The jokes we started making probably didn't help.  Of course, I still finished mine.  If you haven't tried Metro yet, this is definitely the week to do it!

We were up in Cave Creek on a wet, soggy day with plenty of time on our hands between our daughter's chess matches.  We hit the Yelp app looking for a coffee place close by that served breakfast.  When we first walked in, I was ready to leave since all I saw were pastries (although good looking ones) on glass stands, and I had an abandoned cup of (albeit crap) black coffee in the car.  I was squinting to look at a printed breakfast menu encased in a photo holder, when one of the baristas quickly handed me a printed menu.  Belgian waffle, oatmeal, yogurt parfait, french bread with an egg. . . nothing was really catching my eye. I had the feeling these items were a second thought to coffee because they needed to get people in with another option.  We thought about leaving (shame on us) and decided to just get the kids a couple of yogurt parfaits to tide them over until after the next match.  That's when my feelings started to change.  After being handed my latte, the barista asked, "How is it?"  Sincerely.  Like he actually wanted to know.  Well, it was great.  It was the best coffee I've had in a long damn time. They walked out the hot chocolates to the kids, even though we were almost close enough to hand them to.  It's not often servers treat kids like customers.  As we sat, I checked out the woman at the next table eating the oatmeal.  It had a crunchy brulee top with fresh fruit and looked nothing short of divine (well, as close as oatmeal can get). She was friendly, and told me it was as good as it looked.  Next, someone came out of the kitchen and told us they only had enough yogurt for one parfait, what else could they get us? Waffle? Granola? Egg? No big deal, just polite, what can we do attitude.  Kids voted waffle with whip cream of course.  Belgian waffle came out perfectly cooked - brown, slightly crispy, still soft in the inside with a cloud of fresh cream on it.  Next, the parfait - plenty of granola, tart yogurt, ripe strawberries and blueberries abound. Delicious.  My opinion now. . . breakfast might have been a second thought, but it's not treated like one.  Everything we saw was pretty, tasted great, and had fresh ingredients.  And the coffee. . . well I was just jonesing for one on another wet, soggy morning.  We'll definitely make a trip back to Cave Creek to visit this little hideaway.  Oh - and those pastries?  All Tammy Coe if you're a fan.

So I'm shocked at how many stars this place has.  Don't get me wrong.  It is GREAT for kids.  They love all the toppings, it's relatively cheap, the place is clean, and they even have strawberries floating around in the self-serve water cooler.   As far as taste goes, I can no longer put anything in my cup that doesn't have the word 'tart' after it.  The banana yogurt has the same flavor as that Wacky Taffy crap. . . not banana, but candy flavored fake banana.  The pistachio doesn't taste anything like a pistachio. My three year old will no longer touch it.  Even the chocolate is bad.  Both my husband and I have commented to each other that some of the flavors have a chemical aftertaste.  If you are looking for quality yogurt or ice cream, skip this place.  If you're looking for toppings and a fun time for kids, well, then by all means.  Have at it!

I like this place so much for the vibe and the laid back atmosphere.  It's a great place to just chill out and chat, although there are occasionally a few people who are a little too relaxed for me.  Like the chick with her shoes off, reclining on the couch, bare feet and all.  Or the mom who had a meeting and let her son run rampant, including out the front door, and let him harass other kids with a handful of straws.  That being said, I'm very happy to have this place so close to home.  I didn't give it the fifth star, because while the milk is always perfectly creamy, it's often not hot, and I know I might get shot for this, Cartel is not my favorite coffee.  Also, there is one woman who charges double or triple for drinks from what most of the guys charge.   Baked goods also are fresh and get a big thumbs up.

I SO want to love this place.  Not want-ed.  Want.  But so far, I don't. There are some great things - the people are super friendly, seem genuinely happy to be there, and the place is very cool. I like the giant chess set, the kids corner, the couches, mismatched furniture, etc.  There are a lot of cool spaces to park without feeling like you are in someone else's space or conversation.  But some very important things are. . . well, not so hot.  The coffee is not good.  I ordered two lattes the last time I was in there.  The milk was a little more than warm, and just failed in general.  The taste. . . blech.  I ordered a lemon poppyseed muffin.  I should have known when all the front muffins were carefully wrapped in plastic.  (Plastic wrap = not enough movement.)  The muffin was dried out, overly dense, and maybe had tasted okay before it hit the freezer and then the muffin case - last week.   I wasn't too impressed with the smoothie either. I ordered a blueberry banana for the kids to share, and while it may have less calories than your average smoothie, the kids said, "It wasn't bad." My niece said she preferred Jamba Juice, my daughter said she preferred my husband's.  I think if this place is going to make it, they are going to have to WAY step it up on the drinks and food.  Or at least take down the sign touting fresh muffins. . . But I am hoping they can pull it together!

I'll have to add a caveat in here. . . Every time I've eaten at NaRai, I've been at Peter Piper Pizza on a Tuesday evening.  The first time I was with my sister-in-law looking for any healthier alternative and just plain alternative to months of Tuesday night PPP.  We were hoping the deli would still be open, but found NaRai instead.  First thing, it is DEAD on Tuesday nights.  We weren't even sure they were serving as there was no sign of life when we walked in.  It's very pretty inside, and the staff is very friendly.  We ended up with basil chicken, green vegetable curry, and the beef salad to go.  We ordered the dishes 4 and 5 on the 1-5 hot scale.  I've been there twice since and again ordered the 5.  My 3 year old can eat the 5.  My six year old can manage a 3, and she thinks pepper is hot.  We've repeatedly ordered variations of the same dishes, but they've been solid, and we've enjoyed them.  Husband, sister-in-law and I all thought the food was better than Swaddee, and we haven't had much decent Thai in AZ for a long time.  It's definitely no LOS, and doesn't compare to our good friend's mom's cooking, but then there isn't much that would!  We'll be back.

I love this place. I love the coffee. I love the fact that the owner and most of the baristas seem to have more than a touch of perfectionism running through their veins.  I'm just a skinny latte girl, and they not only don't mess it up here, they make it right.  I like the tiny shortbread cookie they give you (even though mine usually disappears), I like the fact that they brought in different types of milks, and I like that you get organic milk without paying extra.  I also like the fact that when sisters and I have kids in tow, we never seem to get any flak for it. From patrons or employees.  The only thing I would say is if the baristas make a mistake, don't get pissy with each other for bad communication.  Fix it.  They all seem like they could relax just a tad.
