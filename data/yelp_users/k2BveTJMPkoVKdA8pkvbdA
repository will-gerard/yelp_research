My mom was visiting town and I thought it would be a great idea to take her to a cooking class because I took one at the Fashion Square location and it was so much fun. This time was terrible. We went to the French Pastry Secrets with Chef Safia Currie and what a bomb! This Chef was so rude and entitled, I couldn't believe it. I should have prepared myself not to ask any questions unless I wanted to embarrass myself in my group. She hates side talk as well. I didn't know I was suppose to do this class in silence. She loves being blunt and calls you out in front of everyone if you're doing something wrong. I didn't sign up to get yelled at. I was there to learn and have fun with my mom visiting from Alaska. This chef loves all the attention she can get! Plus, she thinks she pretty great and mighty and she mighty sucks. I don't know how many times I was talking to my mom or another classmate (whispering might I add) and the chef would drop everything because apparently she is the only person who can speak and she asked me if I wanted to share with the class. I was making a comment about how it smelt so good and she was completely out of line. She made this experience awful and I do not EVER recommend taking a class with this woman. She thinks she's the greatest thing since sliced bread. Chef Safia sucks! She can take those chocolate truffles and stick them up her ass!!!  Plus, they were suppose to call me weeks ago when they had more ice cream machines in-stock and haven't heard shit.

Ask for Geno! He is the best and so knowledgeable! He made it easy and fun when picking out our flooring! We had been to multiple tile/flooring companies lately and Geno was by far the best!!! Thanks Geno! :)

I don't know if I had a horrible experience or what but I was in this past weekend and was not impressed. I called ahead of time to make sure they had time and they said to come in so I did. I wanted a soak on my nails and toes then a polish change on my toes as well. The receptionist (I guess) didn't know I had gel on my toes and the tech guy didn't have time to finish my toes so I had to go to an another nail salon that day to get a gel polish change on my feet. The receptionist apologized but how embarrassing. Worst customer service ever and I doubt I will be back even though they offered 2 free polish changes. Additionally, they didn't even do a good job getting my gel off my nails. My nails are ruined and in horrible condition now. You can see the base coat still. See pictures for proof.

You must go here! Anthony is the best! I have been looking for a great hairstylist for years and I can honestly say I will be with him forever. He gets my roots every time and cuts my hair perfectly. I always feel like a million bucks when I leave! Alexia also works here and she is awesome! She is fun and does updos as well as hair! This is the place to go! I highly recommend coming here. You will not be disappointed!

Don't have Lauren as your server. She has an attitude and doesn't give your change back! She ruin my experience at this place. The food was great but the server was awful and I won't be going back.

I love this place but was extremely disappointed when I decided to take my mom and friend here last night. My friend and me got mint cookie with soft serve and my mom just got ice cream. Once I already paid the cashier told me their soft serve machine wasn't working and asked if vanilla ice cream was okay. I said yes but when we received our dessert even the mint cookie (Italian Ice) was mint chocolate chip ice cream too. Like WTF. You could have told us you were basically out of the 2/3 things we ordered. I didn't want to make a big deal out of this since my mom was leaving town in the morning. I will go back here but it was a disappointment especially since this place is already well over priced.
