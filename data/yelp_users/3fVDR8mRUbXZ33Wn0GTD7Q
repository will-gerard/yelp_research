I've been to Vs several times so that I could give them a fair chance. Each time I have found my experience to be lacking. The haircut was decent, not what you expect from a Barber I said to take off an inch they took off 2.  The customer service was atrocious. I've been to many different barber shops and expect a high level of service.  I expect the barber to try and make small talk with me even if its just asking what I do for a living.  Not only did the barbers not try, but they were rude and would speak in Russian to each other rather than interact with me.  If your going to a barbershop.  I recommend Gio's at 64th street and Bell or there is a shop at Tatum and Cave Creek that is great as well.
