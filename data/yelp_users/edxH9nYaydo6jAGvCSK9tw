The food is bland which I guess is to be expected since it is English.  However, it was substance and not exspensive.

To start off I will say they are committed. They are one of the only places open late. After ordering my phone was on silent so I missed the 3 calls they placed to find my house. An hour later they arrived food still hot.  However, the woman that took my order just took my name, address and phone number.   When they arrived it was a slight ordeal because I had no cash and had to pay by credit card, she called the store and it took quite a long time for them to discuss and run my card.   The food is not flavorful, and now I have a stomach ache. The fried rice looks dyed and the lo me in has orange oil in the bottom. :-(

Awesome place to get a delicious meal on the cheap, especially if you have your student ID! Unfortunately they are on lyrics open for the lunch crowd but if you can make it in the burger an fries are awesome!

Had a wonderful time!  My technician Michelle was amazing  and we had a lovely conversation as she did my nails, and discussed out future plans.  I stumbled  upon this salon after having a horrible experience at Moraiah's II and was simply searching for the next closest nail salon.   Complete 180, they were friendly, courteous and attentive as soon as I walked through the door!  After spending this spring break studying for a differential equations and organic chemistry exams being here was the pampering I was looking for!  Big thanks for being the stress reliever I needed. They are a little more expensive especially for a college student but well worth it! I would have stayed to get my hair done after manicure and feet paraffined if I had more time; because I see that they stock Moroccan oil products!! This will definitely be my self treat when the budget permits!

Unprofessional and poor customer service is an understatement.  It took the technician about 10 minutes to realize I was there.   When she finally looked up from texting  she inquired "what you want?!" Then after learning i'd just like a simple manicure and pedicure she informed me NOT that they did not have appointment available, or that they were busy but instead stated " I don't have time for you now," and inquired if I could come back in 45 minutes, a little put off, I agreed. I returned 45 minutes later and she acted like she didn't recognized me from 45 minutes earlier and said I'd have to wait and asked AGAIN if I could come back 45 minutes later!!!  I choose this location because it is extremely close to campus and thought it would be a nice little break in my study day, but the time spent waiting for an appointment that wasn't going to happen because this moron at the desk can't get it together will make it a location that I am sure to never return too and attempt to actually receive a service, and will be on the warpath to advise anyone else not to go and waste their time.   RIGHT DOWN THE STREET IS DOWNTOWN SALON PHOENIX, I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THEM, THERE SERVICE AFTER THIS ORDEAL WAS IMPLACABLE!
