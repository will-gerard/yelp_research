Trunk Space means more to Phoenix music than 9/10 of all other venues. Their commitment to all ages and happy environment is too inviting to ever diss it. While the sound system isn't professional and no alcohol is served, there are a million other bar venues for that. Trunk Space is about music and art. Favorite venue in Phoenix by far.

Rocket Burger is the best burger in Glendale. Maybe all of Phoenix. The burgers are delicious with their special, handmade sauce and the fries are the greasy, delicious fries everyone in America loves. I'm not big on sandwiches or hot dogs from anywhere so I'm not judging them on that, but the burgers are enough to give these guys 5 stars all on their own.

these jerks spam craigslist every single day, now they don't even post prices anymore half the time probably because people show them a hundred other stores where they can get their stuff way cheaper. never walked in the store and never will. hope they go outta business. i have called the owner before and he hangs up as soon as i say the word craigslist. the guy is a jerk.
