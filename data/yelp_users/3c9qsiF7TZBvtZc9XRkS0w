The front office is comfortable and elegant and the entire staff is so kind! Glad I had my braces done here and love the care I continue to receive with birthday emails and txt reminders for appointments.

Ordered two kids meals and three drinks...was given each item one at a time and then told "goodbye!"   Had to knock on the service window of the drive-thru to get my remaining items.

Between the two main choices for meat, chicken or steak, the chicken is best hands down. Neat atmosphere, friendly staff, and clean environment. Worth trying the papa locas, my kids prefer the vegetarian option.

Always have a fantastic experience here for breakfast. Kids love coming and then we do a hike for a perfect day.

The work outs are always hard but worth it! I use to hesitate in the parking lot weighing my decision to work out or go shopping instead.  After a year the hesitation is gone and I enjoy the reward and am proud of my performance review after each class that tells me my maximum heart rate and calories burned.

I only want to see movies in the plush recliners.--wonderful movie experience.   Great to kill time with the kiddos and  I often play just as many games as they do. ---many highly addictive arcade games.  When bowling the lights are difficult for me to adjust to the dark lighting with black lights.

Able to order a late dinner for a hungry mom and kids and have the bonus of delicious wheat bread for tomorrow's lunches...and all this without leaving my car! Thank you Kneaders.
