A friend turned me on to this place.   The food is top notch.   Justine is a hoot.  If I go too long between visits, I get withdrawls.

This is a great place to take your car if you want to have an oil change turn into a costly repair.   These guys are the kind of place your dad warned you about.

If you are looking for the benchmark of bad BBQ, you are in luck.   Where do I start?   The mashed potatoes were out of a box, the Jalapeno Mac was made with processed cheese......The best suggestion I could make for someone dining here is to smuggle in a really tasty BBQ sauce and drench your food in it and you may be able to choke down their lame attempt at smoked meat.

I have eaten a lot of Mexican food, but this was as good as it gets.  The menu is well thought out and prepared with fresh ingredients.  The wait staff was very friendly and prompt.   Great dining experience.

It has been a while since I have eaten here.  Took a detour off the beaten path and was not disappointed.   Food was well seasoned and thoughtfully prepared.   I will be visiting again soon.

If you you are on a quest to find the driest overcooked reheated BBQ,  You will strike gold with this joint.  Save yourself the disappointment and dine some place else.

This place has a lot of potential, with that being said, for the price, I expect the best most thoughtfully prepare bowl of Ramen.  It was good, but not that good.

If you are looking for a reasonably priced knowledgable staff with a great selection of liquid, this is the spot.   These guys want you to have a good experience with ecigs and will take time to help out.  You have to try the vanilla custard.

It is possible to find great seafood in Arizona.   The salmon was a slice of heaven.  Try the panettone bread pudding for dessert,  you will not be disappointed.

What can I say, I am a sucker for spicy Cajun food and Baby Kay's fits the bill.  It is great to have this in our hood.   Not five star dining, but the food is good and the Key Lime Pie is the bomb.

I visited Rudy's to see what all the fuss was about.   I was looking forward to having some great BBQ.  I am not sure if I caught them on an off day, but that was some dry assed brisket.   I will give them another shot and give them the benefit of the doubt.
