It's another beautiful sunny Arizona morning after an evening of birthday festivities...which after seeing "Check Please" was celebrated here at  Mariscos Playa Hermosa.  We were a party of 10 with a reservation and ready to sample what appeared to be some great seafood!  The restaurant is small with lots of beautiful colors and wooded tables with authentic chairs and I felt like I was in Mexico!  The atmosphere was a bit chaotic ... Although they were not super busy they were running around like chickens with their heads cut off... BTW... Today's special.... Chicken! ... NOT!   In reading previous reviews... The biggest complaint is the service... Or lack of it!  Boy oh boy... They were not kidding!  Why o why do they not have ample employees?  Or at least experienced ones?   HEY OWNER... Do yourself a favor... HIRE SOME EMPLOYEES!!  Moving right along... The place is small so you can imagine it would be loud... Which it was... but that's ok.. Made it feel more festive!  It took forever to just get water and for 10 people they gave only 2 bowls of chips and tiny saucers of hot sauce... Water glasses and drink refills RARELY happened!  We tried many item between all of us.  The larger whole fish was moist and delicious! This was the best part of the evening!  They served their complimentary ceviche which was enjoyable and might I add... A nice touch!  The shrimp and fish in garlic sauce... Let's talk about that for a sec....  Ok, just the other day I cooked some shrimp on the Barbie bathed in butter/garlic. Mine was equally as good if not better because my shrimps were larger.  They use a medium shrimp that's tasty but nothing the average Joe can't make themselves... The fish part of the dish was a saturated fried piece...   Didn't try the rice simply because it looked unappetizing and did not care for the beans... I related them to baked beans... Like in hot dogs and beans... That's the initial taste.  We also tried the crab enchiladas ... Again not impressed... It was filled with crab meat but did not care for the taste ... Nor did anyone at the table.  The tortillas were tortillas nothing special.  Back to the service...I don't want to hear excuses like " it was very busy" because according you all those 5 star reviews( which I just don't get) you should expect it to be super busy on a Saturday night!  One end of the table was almost finished by the time the other end got their food... The servers had absolutely no idea who had what so she pretty much passed the plates and we figured it out ourselves!    I had to ask for all the dirty dishes to be taken away as nobody came to take them.  On to dessert...they knew we were there for a Birthday and we had to remind them several times.  For the birthday girl they give a piece of cake and she chose " tres leche cake" the cake was unlike any Tres Leche I have had.. Had a raspberry? Filling and did not taste very leche... I am no expert at this but the ones I have tried sit in the leche which absorbs into the cake making it somewhat soggy and delicious... This was different ...  I am sure there are many different kinds but it was not a hit at the table...  So, they have this other deal... Where they bribe you to YELP a reviews using names of servers and when they confirm it was posted they give you a piece of coconut cake...so one of the kids at the table did it...  I must say...the coconut cake was delish! Very moist and lots of coconut!  Getting the check was another challenge and when we did get it they charged for 3 items of which we only had 2....  Really makes me wonder... Between the REVIEW BRIBES and the mistakes on the check.... How much money they make this way?  Since we live nowhere close the chances of any of us returning are slim ...  On goes my quest to find some great Mexican food!  I imagine when a restaurant knows they are going to be on TV they make sure everything tastes great and service is great...  But on any other day you see how it really is... Don't believe everything you see on TV  It is a cute place and the fish was good... Give it a try... See what you think!  Never base a decision on one persons review... Food is a preference and I am very tough critic!    Bon Appetite'

Time for another riveting review for all my fellow Arizonians!  Let's start by saying I have had dental issues for many years and in that time have seen MANY dentists! When the time finally came to have some serious dental work done  I chose Artistic Dental as I have seen his work on 2 people and was impressed with their results. Both of these people had many teeth extracted and partials and or full plates done. I do realize it is a lab that makes them not the office I am very nervous going to dentists simply because I know the pain they are capable of inflicting,   When I met Dr Daugherty I found him to be friendly and comforting.  The staff was wonderful and did everything they could to relieve my anxiety! We came up with a game plan and part of that was to remove some teeth.  Let's talk prices for a moment..   Keep in mind the office is in the Biltmore area...need I say more?    Location and cost does not guarantee better work.  They are more expensive than any dentist I have seen but....they say you get what you pay for and my smile is very important to me.  I decided to let him do my top teeth and if the results were positive I would let him do the bottoms.  It was several weeks before I was to start the work and I had a terrible toothache so I went in and  told Dr Dougherty which tooth was hurting and requested he pull it and that would make one less to be pulled in a few weeks.  When he was done I looked in the mirror and was horrified to find he pulled the WRONG tooth!  Because of this I was embarrassed to smile in fear my big gap would be seen since the tooth was toward the front.  Although the Doctor apologized I had lost my faith in him and was now petrified to have the remaining work done...  When the time came I put on my "big girl pants" and went back for the other extractions .  I made it clear how nervous I was and Dr Dougherty assured me he would be gentle and I wouldn't feel any real pain......HE WAS WRONG !  So  what would have happened if he told me the truth?  I now felt lied to ... So let's add things up to this point:  He pulled the wrong tooth  He lied to me  His prices are exsorborant   Moving on... When I paid for the top work I had given them the full amount to cover top and bottom from the estimates they gave me... Although the estimates seemed to keep changing!   The top teeth, although beautiful simply did not fit right... Even after the alignment ... and the only way to fix it would be to drive the 28 miles each way to his office and leave iit with him and make the same drive back to get them with no guarantees . I decided to just deal with them and find a new dentist.    After my experience I put the dentist off for over a year and found a wonderful new dentist close to my house When I told this new dentist of my anxiety he was HONEST with me and said there may be some pain for a very short time during injections but they would do their best to distract me. What do ya know... Honesty... And it didn't kill either of us in fact I trusted him completely after that   At Artistic dental AFTER insurance I would be responsible for appox $1800.00!!!!!!  My new dentist did the same work for $725.00 after insurance!!  Saving me $1075.00!!!  I called Artisic dental and told them I would like the $800.00 approximate  money they were holding sent back to me so I could get the work done.  I also requested a refund of the "alignment" since it didn't correct the problem. I was told they would speak with Dr and call back  I got a call back and surprise surprise it seems they had a bookkeeping error almost 2 years ago and never billed something therefore they only owe me appox $300.00  EXCUSE ME....WHAT? !  I asked her why they are just finding this error now and why they have had my money for almost 2 years and never bothered to call and ask if I wanted it or if I was ever going to come in again.  I told her that was unacceptable and their error from long ago just won't cut it nor should I be held responsible   I had mentioned to her it would cost me $ 725.00. to have work done and I agreed to accept that and put this experience in the past .. Until.... Yesterday.  I was with my friend who had her work done at Artistic Dental and she also told me of her " BILLING ERRORS" she had with their office and that is why she has not been back.  If you are looking to whiten your teeth or do cosmetic work I am sure Artistic will work for you.... But I would think twice about letting them do any serious work.   My last words of advise are.... Check their billing!!! Make sure they are billing your insurance only once and that you are getting the credits! On that note I will say:  Going to the Dentist shouldnt have to be a terrible experience!  ************* UPDATE  JANUARY 2016**************** In my first review I complimented the top plate that although didn't fit right looked nice... Well, it cracked a year later, insurance won't pay for another as it should last 10 yrs!

Hello my fellow Phoenicians and snow birds!  It's time for another truthful review... I should start by saying I am not a disgruntled employee just you're average joe on the way to a day trip in the Superstitions.  I did read some scary reviews but since there seems to be only one "hole in the wall" diner in the area we took our chances and  here it is in one word..  YUK!  There was one server and she ran her butt off , although I only saw her once I felt sorry for her as the place was filled.    The busboys hauled ass cleaning tables, delivering food and everything else so Good Job to all of you!  We got there just past 11 and was told we could no longer get breakfast yet 3 tables around us ordered breakfast so we did too.  We ordered eggs basted but I really knew better... Not everyone knows how to cook them and corned beef hash which I ordered WELL done.  Of course the top was cooked well and middle not at all so I asked if they could put it back on the grill to cook it more..  As they walked away we heard one guy tell the other to put it in the microwave!   Lol  When I got it back.... Well, do I really need to tell you?  The food was hot but not cooked and the based eggs were literally rubberized... The yolk was hard not runny as a basted egg should be.   One of the guys came back and I told him the eggs weren't basted he insisted the were..  I picked the eggs up by the white and it dangled there looking like they were Rubber!  I ate the cooked top part of the hash and half piece of toast and my husband ate his bacon and part of the pancake , we asked for our check and told him how disappointed we were and all he did was apologize ... I told him he should be offering to comp the un eaten meal ..  He gave me a funny look and took back the check and said it would come out of his paycheck!  I said absolutely not and told him i would pay and he shouldn't take the loss because the cook doesn't know how to cook!  I left a most generous tip and we Left... We noticed the help wanted sign for server and cook and I do hope they find people quick.... Especially someone who calls themselves a cook and actually knows what a freaking basted egg is!  I feel sorry for all the snowbirds who flocked this diner that this is there only choice for food in town and even sorrier they somehow developed a taste for this crud on a plate!  The only reason I was generous and gave 2 stars is because I felt sorry for the hard working staff!  So there it is, plain and true!  Try it if you want.... But don't say you weren't warned!  Enjoy the weather and  Bon Appetite'

Been coming to C Fu a couple times a year for years....  We have our traditional Christmas Dim sum every year..and for the last couple years it has been losing its once wonderful food and service qualities.  This Xmas we were dissapointed enough that we wont be back!  80% of the food we were served was not even lukewarm.  We tried to request fresh hot items but we were only successful in a few items.  I even spoke with the owner...as we usually do, to say hello ....this time we told him of our concerns and dissapointed and he didnt seem too concerned.  We also notices several items have shrunken in size....  We have found a couple Dim Sum restaurants that have high reviews and that is what we will try next.  Cold food is Unacceptable and owners lack of concern is a concern....  I noticed the lack of customers...maybe that is why the food was cold....I realize it is dim sum and cant stay hot...however it has always been at least warm...and you used to always be able to request fresh hot items, without them using the microwave to warm the food up...  Note to Owner:..... With the economy the way it is you are really gonna have to step up and start serving a better quality that you could be proud of!

hello my fellow Yelpers!  So, you're looking for a new bank and you thought you might check out a credit union ?  Ask yourself why you want a credit union.  Is it because it used to be onlly "special" people are allowed to bank there... "Members"?  Or because you want a "small town" type bank?  DESERT SCHOOLS is neither!  Anyone can become a member and they are NOT small.  The Bank Managers have very LITTLE authority to make decisions... Everything seems to have to go through a district manager in this case "Shawn Mitchell".who by the way feels his members are not important enough to return a call to.  My beef is with the fact that they charge for most everything!  Don't have direct deposit?... Charge!  Need a check from your own account?... One in 5? Years .... Charge!  Stupid little things that "small town type credit unions" should provide.  The employees have always been pleasant and professional   My husband and I both closed our accounts recently and as I sat with the bank rep I used his scissors to cut up my bank card I had a feeling of freedom!  We are done with a desert Schools!  I used to bank with a credit union for  many years and loved it but this credit union just doesn't deserve our business!  We found a small local bank with free banking, free checks, free ATM reimbursement , better hours and real personalized service.  Good luck to all and think of all your options out there before you join!  Always remember to live for today!

First couple times I went to Rays I was impressed....good pepperoni pizza...although the person making the pizza...I later found out was the owner was rude and I almost walked out the very first time ....  I decided since the pizza was decent I would deal with the "Pizza Nazi" ...after bringing the whole family in for pizza while they  were in town from Chicago  I was pleased the staff was helpful...until we tasted the pizza with everything on it...it was soggy and just plain GROSS...  Of course I am a Chicagoian...with New York roots and love both styles of pizza.... this pizza was plain unacceptable....however having dealing with the owner in the past we chose to never come back...  That was almost a year ago..and I have never been back...  If a restaurant has good food and a horrible staff or owner....then it simply is not worth going back...  Rays has other locations and there are several good pizza places out there...  Why settle?

Just tried this pizza for the first time....although I have lived in the neighborhood 7 yrs...   The picture they have on their brochure depicts a nicely browned and bubbly pizza reflecting lots of cheese that actually looked like cheese...  Unfortunately the actual pizza looks absolutely nothing like the picture...I ordered a pepperoni pizza and there was 2 slices that had 2  pieces of pepperoni and the rest  had one little pepperoni on each slice.  The pizza is very doughy....the toppings are sparse and the cheese is a paper thin layer that resembles a dominoes or papa john type....  .In essence....for $7.40 appox for a 1 topping pizza it will do when you just crave pizza and have little funds ...  Remember....you get what you pay for!     I do have to compliment them on the quaint eating area ....just a few tables but very homey feeling.....very nice employees.  I am not sure if I will try it again....

Service and staff were friendly and knowledgeble.... no wait....of course after experiencing the food it is easy to see why! I would say Los Olivos is 1 very short step up from Arribas. I started with a margarita $7.00 which was quite tasty...and I am still feeling the effects...lol... Fish tacos were expensive $13.95 for 3, Boringgggggg and tasteless...*Yawn* Gazpacho was again very boring and way too peppery.    The salsas were just ok....  I think someone needs to learn about spices... The tortilla chips were stale. Did I mention the Margartia was good? lol One of the people at our table tried the guacomole and enjoyed it but did not care for the chili rellano.  And I must admit I did enjoy the frijoles...good texture and tasty....once you doust it with hot sauce. And so goes the search for some decent mexican food in North Scottsdale area that is affordable. Would I go back to this restaurant.......Naaaaaaaaah! But the Margarita was yummy.....or did I say that already? lol If it is generic mexican you are looking for with a "not so cheap" price tag this might be an option for you. Bon Appetite'

Having read the reviews prior to going, I steered clear of any burgers.... but decided on a Chicago hot dog....other than a poppy seed bun there is NOTHING Chicago about this hot dog...in fact...it tastes exactly the same as the $1.50 hot dog you get at Sams Club or Costco!....not bad...but definately nothing special... The fries arent aweful...but not my taste.... The best part of the lunch was the brewed iced tea which was good.  If you want a great burger....got to Five Guys Burgers...if you want a good Chicago dog go anywhere but here.  I would have ordered the Italian Beef which had good reviews...but I prefer a "Cheesy beef"  If you are from Chicago you know what I mean...however they did not have mozzerella cheese...only swiss?  So I nixed the beef idea...  Will I be back....Absolutely NO!!

chen&wok is simply bad fast food chinese... no ambience....with a  horrible little chinese woman who takes orders and gives nasty looks and no customer service at all!  dont ever ask for anything like a plate or box to bring home leftovers or she will treat you like you are asking for the world!  the food isnt very good...the soup was aweful!  my rule of thumb is to always try a place twice...just to be sure it was not an "off" day...as we all have them...  but this time....i am going against my own rule and wont ever go back!!  the kratchity old chinese woman can stick that in her fortune cookie and eat it!

this location has higher prices than any location i have been ! althought t.v advertises $1.00 menu....this location charges their own higher prices....  their reasoning is....hard to find employees?    i was there a couple weeks ago and got a simple ice cream cone and the man did not bother to hold the cone on the wrapper, but instead held the actual cone....i do not know this mans sanitary habits but i just couldnt get myself to eat the cone......thats what the paper wraps are for!!  i am often in this area and very seldom to i stop here....only when the other places have a long line do i come here, knowing there is never a line....because there are not a whole lot of customers!   there is a mcdonald up the street that has $1.00 drinks and a $1.00 menu...that is actually a dollar....  this is a lower income area , therefore one would think prices  would be more affordable than say...scottsdale!  wrong!  bon appetite!   it'll cost ya

Happy Holidays to my fellow Arizonians and snowbirds.....  If you read any of my reviews you know by now I am the pickiest person I know and.... I detest spending good money on bad food.  So, here we go with Rosatis on Ray Rd in Chandlers review......  I am from Chicago and grew up eating Rosatis on Milwaukee Ave and know what their pizza SHOULD taste like..... now, I understand that everyone who advertises "Chicago pizza" here in Az forgets what REAL Chicago pizza tastes like and I have no idea why nobody can make an authentic Chicago type pizza...  I have eaten at a few different Rosatis locations over the years and this location is BY FAR THE WORST!  I ordered a pepperoni pizza and for some reason decided to get the double dough....not realizing this meant less cheese and pepperoni!  We got the pizza in a reasonable amount of time and it was cold!  The dough looked undercooked and was tasteless and although I ordered "easy sauce" they chose to put no sauce....or so it seemed.  I can only compare this pizza to one of cheap $5.99 pizza places!    Except my medium pepperoni pizza cost $17.00!  As I am sure you already know Rosatis is NOT a cheap pizza...they charge a higher price, which I would not mind paying if the pizza were good, but that is NOT the case!  Not only was the sauce scarce but there was hardly any cheese and like Dominoes or poppa johns they used the type of cheese that doesnt melt.....  How does cheese not melt you might ask?  Your guess is as good as mine unless it is imitation cheese which I am sure they do not use....or so I hope!  I really should have called them and told them their Pizza SUCKED, but I chose to just write my review and not go back again.  How is it possible that Rosatis can be so different from location to location when they use the same ingredients?  Anyway, I was really wanting pizza tonight and one slice of their so called pizza turned my stomach.  If anyone knows a good or even decent pizza place in Chandler area, please let me know.  I would have been better off with a store bought pizza.....  Ya live, ya learn!  So Rosatis.....I think its time for you to read the reviews about your location and make some changes, unless of course you just dont care in which case..... Keep doing what you're doing!  My Suggestion to all of you out there looking for good or even decent pizza in Chandler....stick with Dominoes....it is a lot cheaper and I cannot believe I am saying this but.....better!  If you have read my reviews and agree with my reviews....STAY AWAY from this location of ROSATIS pizza!  Until next time....  Bon Appetite'

Hello again Arizonians and visitors......  I will remind you as alway I am the pickiest person I know and detest spending good money on bad food.  I am going to review Salt Cellar while it is fresh on my mind.  I was taken here today to celebrate my B-day and I LOVE seafood be it raw or cooked.  We sat at the bar, which mind you is a VERY VERY small area and very busy with servers coming and going with drink orders.  There were at least 2 bartenders that we saw and the first bartender to greet(?)us and I use that term lightly   was Dale.   He was quick to get our drink order and deliver it....so far so good... we ordered several items from the happy hour menu to include a couple of oysters on the 1/2 shell which was very tasty and a couple of oyster shooters...YUM and then on to some scallops, which unfortunately due to the very dim lighting we failed to notice were flash fried...(why anyone would want to fry a tender and tasteful morsel of fish is beyond me).  The scallops arrived and looked unappetizing to say the least and tasted equally as unappetizing.    They were tasteless to the point if I didnt know what I was eating I would never in a zillion years guess it was a scallop.  My friend agreed that not only did they have a bit of a sour taste were just ...not good!  The last thing we ordered was escargot, this dish is for the folks who enjoy butter and ggarlic.....not my taste but I did try one and again.....tasteless other than the garlic    taste... I enjoy the taste of seafood and this dish did not do it for me.  I must reccomend the bread, which is soft and extremely good and I was shocked that they actually charge you for bread when you are spending $50 in food but I will admit I was happy to pay for it.  The prices are not cheap but again, I do not mind spending money on good food....this was NOT it!  Now on to the ambiance and service.  When you enter the restaurant you have to walk down many stairs into restaurant which is underground....very kewl concept unfortunately the moment you walk in you feel like you are in a sauna....very hot and humid ...it overwhelms you....especially when the temps outside are 100 plus......HELLO....THIS IS ARIZONA....USE SOME AIR CONDITIONING!  As I mentioned earlier Dale was the first bardenter we saw and as efficient as he was I think he left his personality and smile at home...he did not make us feel welcome at all.   Of course its possible there is some other reason he is unfriendly such as he was having a bad day, or he hated his job or......or......or...... nope...no or's.... a bartender should be friendly... I think its in the bardenter code or something.  Now, I am not a drinker nor do I frequent bars.....but I did years ago and bartenders used to be friendly...isnt that how you make tips?  Even if you are busy?  I had asked an employee his name and we were told he has been working there since 1986?  I am thinking its time for Mr personality to get another job.  This is my opinion of Salt Cellar and it is because of our experience that we will not be returning.  I am sure there are wonderful items on the menu that are delicious but the service and food we did try turned us off.  It is my opinion if you want to spend a chunk of money on seafood try someplace else.... or not....its your call, but until you do.....  Bon Appetite'

Hello to all my fellow foodies :)  Here it is 2 years after my first experience and for some odd reason I chose to celebrate my birthday again at Salt Cellar.  I was really craving some seafood and at the time I forgotten just how poor the first experience was....so.... a group of us met at the tiny overcrowded bar area.  We were allowed to bring our appetizers to the table and still pay the "happy hour" prices... I though this was decent of them.  I was craving scallops and asked more than once if scallops were in season, as I know there are certain times of the year when such items are "in season" therefore providing a fresher delicacy.  The one thing I really enjoyed the last time was their bread... it was crusty and soft and absolutely delicious.  I was told the bread is the same as it always was....NOT!  Dont tell me what you think I want to hear!  The bread was NOTHING like it used to be....this time is was simply "bread"....nothing at all good or special about it.  After many appetizers, we were served our salad...again, nothing special..very basic, except for mine... I guess I got the birthday surprise... a long hair attached to a piece of lettuce! DISGUSTING...   I showed the waiter who was very professional about it and seemed almost embarassed.  The group of us tried several items.  I got the scallops...after being assured they are in season and very good... Why do I bother to ask, when I know they cant say something like "oh no...dont go with the scallops, they are small and not really the time of year for them" and you'll regret it!   These small morsels were overcooked and rubbery and lacked any flavor!  A couple people got surf and turf and the steak also lacked any flavor/seasoning and was not cooked to was was requested.  The lobster, I was told was o.k but nothing to rave about.  We experiemented with some shrimp toast which I really cant describe because I am not sure what it tasted like other than salty...couldnt not detect the shrimp taste.   I returned my scallops and after the hair and rubbery food had no desire to try anything else.  The owner had come over to the table and apologized for the "series of events", his excuse for the hair being that due to the ventilation system hair and partical will fly around... (which of course has to land somewhere...why not my salad)   They removed my scallops from the check....duhhhh any mediocore place would do the same.  I would like to give a special THANK YOU to our waiter.. my apologies for not remembering your name, but he was terrific!  Friendly, quick and when we needed him...he was around.  We got out of there with what I feel is a HIGH price to pay for such a distasteful experience.  When I got home and after hearing my friends give their critique of my choice of restaurant to celebrate at I was pretty unhappy!  I felt the owner, although a nice man, did not care enough about his customers to do something a little "above and beyond" to apologize for the experience and try to keep a customer.  I called the restaurant and spoke with the owner and told him I was very dissapointed and felt that he should have done something more than make excuses.. he kept apologizing and I assured him none of the 5 of us would every return to Salt Cellar.  He finally said he would like to do something for me and asked for my address.  Here it is a couple weeks later...not sure why he wanted my address...maybe he is gonna picket my house or send mean letters...who knows... he never did anything!  It is clear to see why his restaurant is not packed as it was years ago....You may have the repeat business from those who have been patronizing your establishment from back in the day when your food was actually good, or there were no other options for seafood...but guess what?  There are other options!  At this point in my review I usually suggest you go and try for yourself...but this time I am going to save you the time and money....GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!  You will be glad you did.  As for the owner of Salt Cellar....apologies and excuses are simply words....Stand behind your restaurant...you should have wanted to prove to me that you do a better job than was we experienced.  You are cutting too many corners to save money and it is costing you your customers!  Your actions speak for themselves!  It used to be when you mention Salt Cellar people would ooohhh and ahhh...those days are gone, most of the people I mention it to have no idea what Salt Cellar is. That speaks VOLUMES!  And so I say... Bon Appetite'

Hello to All and welcome to my review of Carefree Resort.  Ok, so here it is..... This place is pretty terrific!  Especially for the $50.00 we paid!  I saw a Groupon offering $49.00 room rate.  Since I do NOT care for Groupon I contacted the hotel myself and got the same rate... if I am to be honest, they charged a dollar more $50.00! lol  I was hoping since they didnt have to pay Groupon for our stay we might get the $10.00 "Activity fee" waived....no such luck.  The reservation woman was super helpful.  We arrived and were delighted to see a sprawling well kept property.  Check in was easy and again the staff friendly and the valet parking was free.  We had requested a room close to the pool, but not so close that we had no privacy.  We were delighted to see a well furnished, LARGE room with pictures on the wall that told stories of the property since birth....I found this decor delightful!  The patio had nice chairs but unfortunately was staring right at the pool.... so much for privacy!  Although the room was well insulated therefore we heard no noise from outside.  The bed was comfortable and I am guessing , from previous reviews I had read, that these rooms have been updated.  We sat on our patio enjoying the scenary around us and it was clear everyone at the pool area was having a great time!  Later in the evening we took a stroll down the lighted trails to a cactus garden area which boasted many different cacti and descriptions of each.  The birds were chirping and enjoying the plants as well.  The views as we walked were enchanting.  The mountains and sunset and desert life.... WOW.... it was very enjoyable!  Even the soda machine was only .75 a can...I was impressed!  Later that night we ordered room service... French Onion soup....YUK! No seasoning at all...just terrible and a turkey club which was good and fries which were terrible!  But then again... we didnt come for the room service and wont make that mistake again.  We enjoyed our romantic evening and being the early riser I  am, woke at 4:30am and sat on the patio enjoying the absolute silence other than the birds chirping  At this point I took advantage of the pool area.... ALL to myself!  The pool was great and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  The jacuzzi was hot and bubbly and soothing and simply wonderful.  Check out was just as easy as check in.  We left Cave Creek with a warm fuzzy feeling knowing we will DEFINATELY be back!  In fact I shared our experience with friends and we are all planning a weekend there together.  I am a firm believer that:  If I do not have a good experience I tell management, and if I do have a good experience.... I tell EVERYONE! ... In all fairness, if I am not happy... I write a review and tell everyone anyway....lol  It is my opinion that if you are looking to take a "staycation" or just a night away...you should try CAREFREE RESORT.  They do have spa services and tennis courts and other amenities...however we were only there for 1 night and were unable to take advantage of these "paid for-activity fee" services.  In conclusion....  Live each day as though it were your last and ENJOY !

Hi fellow foodies!  Lees is a great find but be warned..... CASH ONLY!!   Although they do have an ATM machine inside with cheap fees it doesn't always work.  As you wait in line to order there are shelves of Asian foods on each side of you.  So many interesting things to look at keeps you entertained while waiting  Since they seem to always be baking it smells heavenly from the wonderful breads to the soft flaky delicious crossaints and beyond!  It is a must to try one different pastry each time to experience the culture!  I cannot go on enough about their pastries!! AMAZING!!  The sandwiches are a culinary experience that's takes you on a mouth watering tour.  I like the combo on baguette ... Thereis not a ton of meats but enough to satisfy and you can always order double meat for cheap  The sandwiches are less than $5.00 and are on a soft crusty delicious fresh baguette or you can opt to have it in a crossaint so ordering double meat for those who are super hungry still makes it a very reasonably priced meal!  Also tons of drinks to choose from be it Thai tea to coffees to cold drinks and  they have fresh sugar cane drink which as you can imagine is sweeter than I can handle... But was fun to try.  There is ample seating and the place is always clean!  They decorate for holidays and when you walk in the door you feel the welcome!  I am a harsh critic but I gotta say.... LEES IS A MUST TRY RESTAURANT...  And as we all know from my reviews.....It must be something special for me to rave....  Something for everyone!  So in closing..... Remember to take time to stop and smell the roses... Life is too short!  Bon appetite'

Yes..... you're eyes are not playing games with you... I rated Bobby Q's with TOP ratings and well deserved!  As always I start out by reminding everyone that I am pickiest person I know and when I like a place.... I tell all and when a place sucks... I also tell all! lol  Lets start in the parking lot with attendants guiding us on where to park...I guess happy hour is a BIG thing there.  We were immediately greeted and seated in a comfortable chair on one side couch on the other table.  Justin was there in a jiffy for drink orders and telling us "newbies" about the restaurant and even its backround.    The ambience was warm and comfortable (other than the BOOM BOOMING noise coming thru the wall from the bar)  We were served warm and totally AWESOME corn bread while we decided on what to order.  We shared a 3 meat combo, I believe the price was $21.00 but dont quote me.  The combo included a choice of 3 meats and we chose  spare ribs, pork and brisket which came with 2 sides.  Justin brought a sample of the mac and cheese and OMG....that is some damn fine mac/cheese....very very rich but yummy!  Having had our share with the sample,  we chose the pecan cole slaw and bbq beans as our sides.  The meal arrived in no more than 5 minutes and they were nice enough to split it on 2 plates for us.  The pork was incredibly moist and smoky yumminess...the brisket was tender and again that smoky flavor with just a little sauce on top as not to drown it and the ribs fell right off the bone.  Justin brought us some mild and spicy bbq sauce and they were both tangy and full of BAM!  The cole slaw was not too wet from mayonise overdose and just perfect and the bbq beans were a little sweet but very good.  And when you feel stuffed and have had your fill they bring you a little brown bag with a few homemade mini doughnuts....just a tad sweet and the perfect end to a perfect meal!  Keep in mind I have been on a quest to find what I feel is some good BBQ and this my friends is it! (would I steer you wrong?) :)  I have tried the Honeybears...yuk  and the place in Glendale that was on the show "check please" (yucky sauce and ribs were nothing to write home about and their cole slaw was soaking in mayo)...ick.... and Dickeys which....well...I really have nothing good to say about that place (see my review from last month).  I have been hearing about Bobby Q's for a while now, but never felt like taking the long drive out there.....boy oh boy am I glad I did.  As I always say....food is a matter of personal preference and I would gladly pay the price for good food but it pisses me off to pay good money for lousy food! Which is why I feel obliged to share my opinion with my fellow Arizonians out there.  Overall I say GO!  TRY!  ENJOY! and until you do.......  Bon Appetite'

So we went back last Friday for a birthday celebration and what can I say..... OUTSTANDING!  This time our server was Alyissa (I hope I spelled that correctly).  Same experience, greeted right away and although we had to wait 15 minutes or so, it was enjoyable sitting outside during our wait.  Server was GREAT and the food was GREAT and the manager was GREAT!  I LOVE how the manager will visit to ask how things are and when she discovered the birthday boy LOVED the MAC AND CHEESE she brought him another serving with a candle in it! The birthday boy mentioned to our server that the MAC AND CHEESE was the best he's ever had (this coming from a 14 yrs old mac and cheese expert) so being the FAB server she was, Alyissa brought him another cup full of mac and cheese!  You have to know that their mac and cheese is creamy and rich and the absolute BEST I have had in a restaurant.  Then they brought  the birthday boy a decedant to die for Chocolate brownie with ice cream and whipped cream for dessert, with 4 spoons! lol  This 14 yr old boy says this is the BEST restaurant he has ever been to and this young man has traveled all over the world and eaten at MANY restaurants since he was practically born!  From the mouth of babes! lol  This is a must try restaurant.... give it a try....and until you do.....  Bon Appetite'

Hello all you foodies out there :)  Today I will give you our opinion of JOES BBQ.  And I do realize food is a preference and I am a very picky person.  I realize Joes has its local following, however from a girl who has tried many of the BBQ joynts here in the greater Phoenix area I have to say.... I DONT GET IT?  I was being fair in trying Joes twice.....just to make sure it wasent an off day.  We first went to Joes pick up window a few weeks ago and tried a slab of ribs and a combo plate with chicken, ribs and some bbq beef and bbq pork.  I enjoy some good "fall off the bone" ribs but what I got was a slab of "pry off the bone" ribs.  I must say the bbq sauce was ok but the meat was tough and chewy and I was extremely dissapointed.  On the combo place the chicken was dry as were the meats.  I would like to compliment the MAC and CHEESE which is better than most and the BBQ BEANS were also tasty.  I called  Joes to ask if I could bring back the ribs, of which I ate 2 bones, and get our money back and I was transfered to a very friendly manager who talked me into letting her send us a gift card so we can try again.  She insisted their ribs are normally "fall off the bone".  I told her I would prefer to bring back the food so she can see for herself what we spent good money on, but she talked me into trying again.  Ok, so here it is a few weeks later and we happen to be on Gilbert Rd and decided to  try again.  We got a 1/4 pd bbq beef sandwich and a 1/3 pd bbq pork sandwich.  The order taker gave a choice of sliced pork or chopped of which I prefer chopped.  When we got home what we had was a bun and in a seperate styrofoam container a slop of what I am assuming was the bbq beef that looked disgusting and tasted equally as disgusting.  NO bbq sauce on the side!  The bbq pork was plain, dry,  big hard hunks of pork and only one small side of bbq sauce, not nearly enough to wet the pork or even cover the pork.  Both sandwiches were thrown away...   For dinner we ate mac and cheese and a small side of bbq beans.  So now I have to ask again.....PEOPLE..... PLEASE get in your car and drive into Phoenix to BOBBY Q's BBQ and give their food a try.  I realize we all want a good place close to home but Joe's simply doesn't do it for us.  Luckily the gift card we received is also good at JOES farmhouse grill...which is a fun place to visit, otherwise we would have sent the card back with a "thanks...but no thanks.... even free it's not worth it!  We would rather drive 1/2 hour to BOBBY Q's and enjoy some real good BBQ.  You can look back at my review of BOBBY Q's.    We went there many times and have NEVER been dissapointed and I am a TOUGH critic!  I would suggest if you decide to eat at Joe's, try the root beer...it is quite good!  If you enjoy corn bread..... dont eat it here...it is $2.29 for a small square of thin corn bread.  The taste is ok, but not at all worth the price.  And so I repeat.... I DONT GET IT!  nor do I like it! Nor will be back or recommend  Joe's to anyone.  This is just 2 peoples opinion, but as I always suggest.... give it a try and see what you think, and before you make a decision...try BOBBY Q's and compare.  And until you do......  Bon Appetite'

Hello again Az foodies.....  I hope you are enjoying this beautiful Arizona weather :)  In my quest to find good pizza in my area I decided that I will have to go beyond the places that deliver....which are few pickins....and go to an actual pizza place.  Nicantoni's is pretty close, so we stopped by and found the place to be small yet very cute.    The girl who took our order was super friendly and the smells reminded me of those little N.Y pizza joynts.  I ordered a small (6 nice size slices) and made it a point to ask for "EASY SAUCE" and I also requested that they put the cheese all the way to the crust, so  we can enjoy the cheese  all the way down to the crust.  15 minutes later we picked up our pipping hot pizza and couldnt wait to experience what we hope would be a good pizza......  We opened the box and alas..... the cheese covered about 3/4 of the slices and the sauce was ample....now if you recall, I asked for EASY SAUCE.  Now, we enjoy a little grease on our pizza but when you pick up a slice and fold it over and the grease saturates an entire napkin(the thicker napkins, not the little one ply),,, I would have to say ..... thats just a wee bit too much grease!  The first 3 bites had nice flavor, then came that 4th bite and along with the bite what was left of the cheese.  That left a 1/4 of the slice, sitting there with all that sauce and  crust and NO toppings.  So, I tossed that and on to another slice....same thing, a few bites and thats it for the toppings.  Although I am from Chicago and enjoy pan pizza and the Chicago squares...I also visited N.Y often enough that I love their pizza as well.  Would I go back?  Probably not, but if I did I will make sure I tell them AGAIN exactly what I want and take my chances.  They do give you a token with each pizza and after 10 of them you get a free pizza, which is a nice gimick.....btw..... anyone out there want my token?    I dont think we will be there enough to ever get our freebie.  So as I always say...well usually always....go...try...see what you think.  And until you do....  Bon Appetite'

Hello all you followers out there......  This review is a long time coming...   We have been to mystery manion 4 times and each time it is simply FABULOUS!  Starting when you walk in and meet Kim who is super friendly and has a nice smile.  They moved the stage to the center of the room which was a nice change since we were last there.  The charachters in the show begin to greet you immediately and schmooze with you and you are not there 5 minutes before you are in stiches!  There were 4 of us and another couple were seated with us and it was fun meeting new people.  We were all there for the same reason and that was to laugh.  This show was "VAMPIRES WEDDING" and as in every show I have gone to see the star actor in my opinion is always the same... I apologize because I do not know his name but in this show he is the "gypsy".  He is amazingly hilarious and I enjoy everything about him!  However I have to give thumbs up to the entire cast as each one did a FANTASTIC job of entertaining us.  I was surprised that tonights performance had a very small audience but we found it an almost "intimate" evening.  By the time the show was over we all knew something about one another and people were milling around talking to eachother and taking pictures.  The bar staff was also wonderful...thank you Phoebe!  So now we know the show was fantastic but there is one thing they must do something about...and that is the food.    This place is connected to CoCo's restaurant...need I say more?  I realize we pay $41.50 for the show but I do feel they should get rid of the food or bring in Mcdonalds or something...anything would be better than that food...and we thought the old location in the chinese restaurant was bad!  Or do away with the food altogether and drop the price $10.00.  Anyway....I am giving 4 stars and for me that puts this place in "elite" category..  Get rid of the food or make a drastic change for the better and I will give you the 5 stars you so deserve!  So, for now.... live each day as though it were you last and ENJOY!

Hello all my fellow Yelpers!  I gotta lay it on the line here..... WHAT DID THEY DO TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD FRYS..... AND WHY DID THEY DO IT?!?!?!?  They took a perfectly good store with friendly employees and reasonable prices (compared to Safeway) and tore it all apart... Inconveniencing everyone for months and built a bigger store to include things like a sushi kios (because there just aren't enough sushi restaurants in the area)  which has a limited selection... They did not have or know what " hamachi /yellowtail" is. Basic sushi 101  The weekend of the grand opening I couldn't find a cart anywhere... They were sitting in the parking lot  After snagging one from a customer who just left I noticed a woman with some people who looked like some "higher ups" so I mentioned to the woman there were no carts at which time another shopper also experiencing the same problem voiced her concern.  Turns out she was the manager... Which looking back now would explain why the employees don't seem very happy!  She was not very friendly and kind of shirked me away!  The produce department does look beautiful with exotic fruits and such... You know... Those every day grocery items!  But the prices have skyrocketed... Unless it's on sale.  It's not that the produce is better than it used to be... They just shine the fruits up more and display them nicer.... NOT WORTH THE PRICE they are charging!  They are trying to turn our local store into an A.J's type thing with salad bar and olive bar... Which is all fine and nice but looking at the olives was not pleasant as they look like they have been there forever... and the salad bar is nothing to speak of  I am all for A.J's when I want those speciality items but why turn this frys into a speciality wanna be store?  I have also noticed the employee have changed.... From the older man at the deli.... Wouldn't hurt you to act like you enjoy people!  To the checkout people.  It used to be fun shopping there ... Now their prices have inflated so much I have chosen to use a different frys and the cashiers aren't as fun... Pretty much the employees don't seem too thrilled nor do your loyal customers!  This is just one shoppers opinion.... I wish you luck and hope your olives and sushi help pay for the cost you endured.  I am so very disappointed with their choice to turn our neighborhood market into what it is today...  You lost my business  In closing....  Always remember to stop and smell the roses...  Life is too short!

Hello to all my fellow fresh produce and fruit lovers,  Times have changed and u can no longer walk into any market and feel you are getting what you paid for!  If I could afford A.J's it would be no problem but like most I have to really shop around.  I tried Whole Foods for a month and nothing was consistent and I wasent about to pay those prices if the items were not impeccable!   I went to this SPROUTS location and decided to chat it up with a few employees hoping they would pick me some good fruit and it worked!   Ronnie ( hope I spelled that right) came to my aid and told me best fruit and produce to buy... Ronnie made excellent suggestions on what to put in my fruit salad to what other items to serve and suggestions on how to make them.  Seems Ronnie was a chef and has a love for food, which is easy to see when he talks about it.  All of the employees seem to really enjoy what they do which makes for helpful smiling place to shop.  I recently went to the location on Val Vista and although the employees were friendly and helpful,  the assorted apples and oranges I purchased were terrible! I had purchased these same items at Ray location just the week before and it was all terrific!  I called Ray location and spoke with Tony who was gracious and professional and told me to ask for Laura next time I came in and she would take care of me... And she did just that!  I brought the items back and Laura was friendly and professional and I left there a very happy camper!  I love that Tony stood behind his products therefore representing this Sprouts store in the best way possible!  I will continue to shop there each weekend and I look forward to seeing Ronnie and meeting Tony and all the other wonderful employees that make up the BEST SPROUTS I have yet to  been to!  So, go try this store and say hi to Tony and Ronnie and if you ever want to know if the fruit is good... Ask Ronnie.. He will cut you a piece to try so you know what you're getting!  Only the best for us.... Because we deserve it!  Enjoy your fall season and Bon Appetite'

hello my fellow Yelpers   This breaks my heart to say but.... What the heck happened??  This was my favorite produce store with my favorite employee who guided me to the best fruits and produce.....  It seems my favorite employee has moved to another store and since that happened It seems my purchases have mostly been a waste of time and money!  This summer I made 4 attempts to purchase cherries and every single time was disappointed!  Don't get me wrong... The manager Tony is still great and They still stand behind their products and will gladly exchange or refund bad merchandise but it gets to be a concern when I feel I am going out of my way to have to return these items!  Now it has simply become an inconvenience to shop there  Gone are the days when my favorite employee would cut into a piece of fruit to let me sample!  I did ask an employee to do that for me and he looked at me like I was crazy!  I still shop here... Not as often and my purchases have been less due to really terrible products  There are a bunch of new employees and as I walk thru the store the employees just don't seem to love their jobs the way Ronnie did... I guess that is why he was employee of the year!  So on goes my quest to find some good, consistent fruits and produce!  I have put off updating this for months in hopes things would turn around but after this last visit I just found I had no choice especially because I so highly recommended this store!  I hope you have experienced better than me over the last many months...  But as my followers know... I tell it like it is!  So to end my update I will remind everyone.....  Don't  just live life...enjoy it!  Bon appetite'

Hello again my fellow Arizonians....  I am back and ready to review GANDOLFOS Deli........  I will start by saying the Pastrami is pretty darn good!    The meat is seasoned well and does have that NY Pastrami taste.....however..... (and I know you knew that was coming)....  The price for the amount of meat they give is just ridiculous!  I have read the reviews and if I had a groupon maybe I would have been less dissapointed.  Ok, a plain ole pastrami sandwich on their marble rye...which I must point out is NOTHING like good NY rye...the bread is thick and really tastes very little like rye... is $10.00.... and is supposed to be served with a pickle slice....didnt happen!  I can only compare it to other local deli's such as Chompies, who charges the same price but the same sandwich but has twice as much meat.  A REAL N.Y pastrami or corned beef sandwich is so thick with meat you can barely bite into it and just half a sandwich satisfies the biggest of appetites.  The experience started with a call to the restaurant to request they fax a menu which they were unable to do.  The young man I spoke with was not too helpful or friendly.  I had to ask 3 times..... How much is a plain ole Pastrami sandwich....  I asked if the cole slaw, which not included, was creamy or more vinegary...he didnt know how to answer that....  am I asking a strange question here?  This is supposed to be a deli....cole slaw is typical deli fare.... if I ask what kind...tell me, describe it to me... I am not there and cannot see it, nor did I have access to the internet to look.  Several of us from work ordered together and none of us got our "complimentary" pickle slice nor did they include the other condiments we requested.  We're talking 10 bucks for a regular sandwich....I deserve the darn pickle! lol  I didnt bother to call and have a little chat as the person who had the priviledge of picking up the order mentioned the "old man" we are guessing the owner? Was a grump and not the friendliest of people....so..... here I am, sharing my experience with others.  I do not mind paying $10.00 for a sandwich but that sandwich better be packed with meat....or 14k gold shavings!  Ok, maybe it was lunch time and busy....or maybe someone was in a bad mood...or maybe the young kid just started and simply wasent fimilar with their product.... I dont know, nor do I care .....  I am not getting what I paid for and that SUCKS!  So here's the 25 thousand dollar question....will I return?  Nope...not a chance!    I can get around the unfriendly employees and the lack of knowledge of their own menu but I will NOT pay $10.00 for a sandwich with 1/2 the meat that should be there.....  I will find another good pastrami sandwich or I will wait until I visit New York again.  There may be some die hard Pastrami lovers out there who simply must have good pastrami regardless of price and to them I say... "go for it".  But not this girl!  I feel I should get what I pay for and this was NOT worth the price!  Again, I can only compare it to other Deli's here in the Phoenix area or since they advertise it to be "NY pastrami" I compare it to a Pastrami sandwich you get in ANY N.Y deli and GANDOLFO's looses.  So, with that being said...give it a try and see what you think.....and until you do.....  Bon Appetite'

We've been shopping at Bashas for years and in the last year each time we go we it seems to get worse.... The store is clean but the produce is lacking. The quality is NOT at all what it once was....almost as if some produce has been sitting around a while....grape tomatoes...although costly have been soft and not firm as they should be. I realize the occasional bad purchase is to be expected but we havent been impressed with any produce in the last several months....you know its bad when you get better produce at frys or safeway! Although the employees are friendly and will glady exchange or return the merchandise....it is a HUGH inconvenience to bring back a watermellon or refridgerated items not to mention the time and gas it takes to do so. I had stopped shopping here for a couple months and just went back a couple times and I remember why I left. Bashas has a LOT of competition and has to work hard to compete and sadly they seem to be losing the battle!

Hello to all of my fellow arizonians and visitors!  As always I will mention that I am the pickest person I know and detest spending good money on bad food....and with that, here's my opinion of Yo Paulys.  I have ordered 4 times now and I gotta be honest, the first time around I wasent too impressed but saw a great deal of potential.  Lets start from the moment they answer the phone, If a very personable guy answers and calls you "dear" then I believe its Pauly? or the owner.  Who doesnt like to be schmoozed a little! lol  He was very helpful and took time to answer all my questions.  We had an all meat pizza, Not my choice (but the hubby likes the meat).  The pizza was a bit soggy and just not fantastic, although he did throw in some yummy garlic knots.  A couple of weeks later I tried again and ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza and was completed delighted!  The crust was a little soft and doughy but not too much so....it was perfect for my taste.  The pepperoni was very tasty and the mushrooms fresh ....but the Cheese.....the cheese was creamy very tasteful and generous.  Overall I was very satisfied....but wait....not so fast!  I tried again just to make sure It wasent a fluke.  This time I ordered a White pizza (I know it has a real name) and since I am not a sauce lover I found this to be an AMAZING pizza!  The ricotta added a delightful rich flavor that complimented the roma tomatoes and the pizza is my FAV so far.  Tonight we tried again and stuck with an easy choice, half sausage and mushroom and half pepperoni and mushroom and again, it was a great pizza.  So thats it in a nutshell....I think this is a "must try" pizza joint and would love to hear your thoughts.  And as for you PAULY.....keep up the good work.....4 stars from me is a raved review!  As for the rest of you out there, give it a try and I hope you in enjoy, and until then.....  Bon Appetite'

Hello Yelpers ,  Ok... So you know how we all watch those food tv shows like CHECK PLEASE Arizona and the food always looks amazing and their service is impeccable???  I guess the only way to get that amazing food and impeccable service is to be a critic for a food show!  Of course when cameras go into a restaurant everything is going to look and taste great... Unless you have cameras rolling...  It is my opinion that you GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!  I made a reservation to celebrate my friends birthday for Sunday morning.  I told the girl it was a celebration and she assured me it was noted and will be acknowledged.  Arriving first, I AGAIN reminded the hostess about the birthday and again she assured me it was  noted.  Friends arrived and as we looked at the specials my friends told me how they have been to the BLUE ADOBE in Scottsdale and therefore she was able to make recommendations.  I was prepared for bad service as the reviews made that clear...  The server arrived acting like she was working in some 50's diner where inappropriate behavior was acceptable.. As she rushed us thru ordering ... She referred to one of us as "stripes"... Yes... She was wearing a striped shirt... But REALLY?  If that wasent UNPROFESSIONAL enough after taking our order she put our bill in the table....  We just ordered.... Who puts the bill on the table before you eat??  Who was this woman and why is she working there?   We ordered a lobster dip which took quite a while to get it and when we did we all just looked at eachother..   It was in a tiny bowl and was liquidy and had a cheese hunk of stuff just clumped in the middle...  My friend orders this all the time at the Scottsdale location and said at the other location it is served on a black hot plate and the serving is twice what we got..  Did I mention this dip is $10.00!!!!!  We returned it as we all agreed it was pretty gross.  Our server was obviously perturbed and her actions made this clear.  The restaurant was fairly empty so I am not sure why we could never find her.  We ordered the lazy tacos which were good... Not great...  Chili rellanos which is deep fried not in an egg wash but the cheese was hot and good.  I ordered the chili rellanos burger... MEDIUM RARE. ... Which needless to say was served well done, I had no choice but to ask them to make another... Just can't eat well done meat.  When they brought the new burger it was done just fine but the fries were from the first order and served cold!!!  REALLY?  I do have to say the burger had a wonderful flavor  Nothing tasted the same as Scottsdale location so we asked the server if they are same owner .  One server said SCOTTSDALE LOCATION IS A KNOCK OFF" of theirs??  We didn't have to worry about getting the check because it daunted us all thru our meal sitting there on the a table.  We paid and asked for change for a twenty and the server brought no singles!!  REALLY?? Did she really think she deserved a $10 tip on a $40 dollar bill?? NOT!!  I had told the birthday girl that I made them aware of her birthday 3 times!!!   So we decided if her birthday was acknowledged we would tip 20% ... If not 15%  Of course nobody did anything!  I never would have gone to this restaurant if I had not seen it on CHECK PLEASE.   And we will NEVER be back!  I hope the owner of this restaurants actually reads these reviews to better their business because they lost our business!  If you are going to try BLUE ADOBE... GO TO THE SCOTTSDALE LOCATION for the best service and better tasting food.. Same menu and price.  Wherever you go or whatever you do, remember to smile and enjoy... You only live once!  Bon Appetite'

Hello my fellow Arizonians......I'm back for another review....]  I will start as always by reminding you I am the PICKIEST person I know!  And as we well know, food is a matter of preference and I know what I like and I am a TRUE foodie...I like good food and I despise spending good money on bad food(or bad anything for that matter)  I saw this place by accident and went home and read reviews.  Although most of the reviews are positive, I was concerned to see people compared it to places with names like Gyros Express(if that is a real place).    It tells me I probably wont like it and sure enough.......  The employees were friendly and service prompt (of course we were the only ones there).  The restaurant felt like a sauna, not sure if the A/C was on the fritz or if the employees enjoy sweating.  I got the Gyros sandwich with fries and a drink for $5.75.  The price was fair but the food?  The meat was tender but to me the seasoning was too salty which took away from the flavor of the meat.  The fries were your everyday, basic, boring kind...no real taste to them.  I enjoy a chunkier  tzatziki that has that flavorful cumcumber taste which this is NOT! (just a matter of preference).  Not much more to say, nothing looked appetizing enough to make me want to return.  If you enjoy a GREAT Gyros you must try "GEORGES GYROS" on McKellip/Miller...I will do a review on them next so check it out!     and until you do......  Bon Appetite'

I'll start by reminding anyone who reads this that I am a VERY picky person as you can see by my reviews! I took a friend here for Sunday brunch for her birthday....I chose Z'Tejas because they have a "bloody mary" bar, and I do love my Sunday morning Bloody Mary! We were immediately greeted and seated by a friendly hostess and joined promptly by our server "Bubba". I normally dont mention names as not to make anyone feel bad....but with Bubba there's nothing to feel bad about. He greeted us with a super smile and his outgoing personality which made us feel at home instantly! We started, of course, to the bloody mary bar which offered a large variety of hot sauces and condiments.....although I enjoy my bloody marys I really dont know how to make a good one, but with the assistance of several employees who were happy to help, I enjoyed a darn good drink! My problem with the condiments was that most of it looked dried out ex: carrots, celery and pickles. While enjoying our drinks Bubba came to our table to make us the guacamole we ordered, he showed us each ingredient before adding it and a few minutes later we were digging into our guac and chips...yummmmm We shared a "shrimp omelete" which had baby shrimp,goat cheese and was very good.  We couldnt decided on the corn bread, morning glory muffin or the fresh fruit, so Bubba, being the excellent server he is brought all 3. The cornbread was fluffy and not at all crumbly which I did not prefer, but it really is just a matter of taste. The omelette came with little potatoe chunks that were well seasoned. Here comes the Con (the 2nd reason they lost points)....we had just started with our appetizer of guac and chips when they came to the table with the main course. We would have preferred to enjoy what was already on the table before bringing more, especially because by the time we got around to the omelette it was not hot. They brought my friend an "on the house" birthday desert which was a browine type mixture baked as a pie with a dab of whipped cream on top. The brownie pie is a "MUST TRY", it was sweet and decedant and sinful and we loved it! We never had to ask for anything as Bubba visited us frequently to check on things. The atmosphere is comfortable, big and airy and a great place to enjoy a meal or just a cocktail. We WILL be back and I do reccomend you give it a try....and dont forget to ask for "BUBBA"... In the meantime.....  Bon' Appetite

Hello to all my fellow Az foodies!  Today I would like to tell you why I think if you are looking to enjoy some sushi and you think about trying Teharu in Tempe you should get back in your auto and drive over to your local grocery store and buy it there!  It has to be better than what you will experience here.  My friend has been RAVING about Teharu in North Scottsdale.  She tried it a few months back and has been a frequent customer since.  She came out to Tempe to meet for some sushi and having heard so many great things about the Scottsdale location and that the owner of each location are brothers I was super excited to check it out.  We went at 2:30pm, the place was pretty empty, yet that converyor belt was full of shushi... I am not sure who all that food was for but lets stop a moment and think about it... ok, so this conveyor belt runs the length of the dining room and there are maybe 10 people in the restaurant and you have to wonder just how long that food has been taking the "conveyor ride".  Absolutely NOTHING looked fresh and or appetizing....the freshiest looking food was the little cans of fruit that were "just along for the ride".  The signs indicating what the items were, were scarce.  They have maybe 4 or 5 of each item and each one had a different look and color....scary stuff!  The fried items sat under a plastic cover with the moisture dripping back into the food.   In theory conveyor belt sushi sounds good and although this may be common in Japan... this is Not Japan and it just doesnt work!  There were several items we had to take off the belt just to try and identify and we put it right back on...  I know you dont even want to consider this but.......... whos to stop someone from lifting the lids and touching the food as it goes by?  Like you, I would hope noone is inconsiderate enough to do something like that but really..... happens all the time!   Do you really want to chance it?  I tried  a couple items before I just couldnt do it anymore.  The ends of the fish were discoloring and turning up .  I wont bother to go into detail about any one item because there was not 1 item worth talking about.  My friend assured me that the Scottsdale location was nothing like Tempe and she said if she had tried Tempe location first she NEVER would have gone back or tried the other location.  It's the same for me... I made the mistake of trying Tempe location and I have absolutely no desire to try Scottsdale..  From what we were told 2 brothers each own one of the stores but they are run completely different..  So, heres a tip for the brother who owns Tempe location.....   LISTEN TO YOUR BROTHER!  DO WHAT HE DOES.... you are giving TEHARU a bad name!!  What would your mother think?  Oh yes, almost forgot to mention the employees... theres plenty of them... standing around ... but try to get some more water or wasabi!  HA!  I would honestly have to say in the MANY years I have been ejoying sushi...this was the WORST I have yet to experience.  One of the many reviews I read on Teharu wrapped it up to this... "mediocre at best"... I feel that was extremely generous!  Usually at this point I say... go, try it...see what you think but I gotta say....  Dont waste your time or money and dont insult your taste buds.  Spend a few bucks more and go somewhere ...anywhere else!  And so I say, enjoy each day as though it were your last and enjoy! Bon' Appetite

Hello to all of my fellow Foodies out there :)   This review of Cafe Bink will be short and sweet.... ok, well not so sweet.... but I will try to keep it short!  We went last weekend around 3:30p, the place was empty which is fine with us.... our thinking here is.... better service and fresh hot food.....  Cute ambiance... lots of ourdoor seating.... not too much indoor seating.  We chose from the "happy hour" menu which consisted of just a few items .  We really came to try these "fries" we read so much about and also decided to share a burger (which was on the happy hour menu).  We ordered the burger "medium rare"... standard order and for a restaurant in their "caliber" we expected a medium rare burger.  We also ordered the fries...of course!  We got the fries first and I dont get what the hype is about.  The fries are thick long strips that do not taste especially good but the dipping sauces were the saving grace.   I am not a big salt person but I found it odd that there were no salt/pepper on the table and the fries had 0 seasoning.  We ate maybe 8 fries total between both of us... even the truffle ketchup wasent good enough to cover up the "not so great" fries.  Lets preface this by saying the food was ready and sitting under a heat lamp and our server nowhere to be seen.  Luckily someone else noticed the food sitting there and brought it to the table.  It was very nice that they cut it in half so we each had a plate.  However..... the burger was medium...WELL!  Come on now.... how can you trust a well reviewed restaurant that can't cook a burger Medium RARE?  The burger was quite juicy but did not make up for the Overcooking.  I ate 2 bites and along with the few fries asked for our check.  They did remove the burger from the bill...which any half way decent place would do.  We left there paying $12.00 for a couple bites of a burger a few fries and 1 soda.  Needless to say.... we will not be back!  I guess my review wasent as short and sweet as I said it would be....but if you have read any of my reviews you know... they are never short and sweet! lol  On that note, as I always say... Go... try.....and see for yourself  And until you do.......  Bon Appetite'

I would have to agree with most of the reviews for Dickeys... I got what I thought was a great lunch deal....a brisket sandwich with 1 side and a drink for $6.00.  The bread was ick...nothing at all special , the meat was dry and VERY bland with 2 tiny rings of onion and 2 small pickle slices....if it wasent for the average bbq sauce I would have tossed the sandwich and learned where NOT to go for BBQ!  I chose cole slaw as my side which like the brisket was bland and nothing to speak of.  One  of the people in my party had mac and cheese...."can you say boring"?  Althought another person got the "baked potatoe casserole" as a side which was actually really good..... in fact I would say it was the best thing I tasted there.  A nice perk is the mini ice cream cone you make yourself.....especially when you put it in a cup and add Root beer!     Dickeys is the closest BBQ place to me and yet I would rather go without or take a drive to the next closest place.  Food is s personal preference and I am the most PICKEY person I know and the only reason I would go back is to get some more of that potatoe casserole!  You decide....and in the meantime....  Bon Appetite'

Hi All!  This review is long overdue!  I have been to Georges numerous times, I have brought friends and family from Chicago as well.  I have to say Georges is my FAV Gyros place around!  The prices are fair and the food is very good.  I have only had Gyros but one of these days I will try something else.  The gyros sandwich comes with a choice of fries or greek salad.... I always get the salad, never tried the fries.  The salad is always a nice amount with a perfect amount of dressing...not too much but enough and it has feta, onion and even those yummy klamata olives.  The tzaziski is chunky and flavorful and is good for dunking anything in or eating plain.  The meat is well seasoned and ample and I have yet to be dissapointed!  One think I always look for when making repeat visits to any business is consistency and I have George to always be consistent.  A few visits ago the owner brought my friend and I a piece of  Baklava to sample and I would have to say.....the BEST I've ever had!  Sweet and savory but not that drippy saturated sweet, the perfect end to a good meal!  My only CON is that it takes an unusually long time to get the food, therefore I am not sure I would go there for lunch if you are on a time restriction.  Keep it up guys....you have rated high in my rating system!  I do reccomend Georges and really think you should give it a shot.  and until you do.........  Bon Appetite'

Happy Valentines to my fellow foodies-  Everybody Knows not to wait until the last minute to make reservations for the most romantic holiday of the year... But did we do that?  Nope!  Instead we waited until we couldnt get in to a local Chandler steakhouse and my husband really wanted steak.  As a rule of thumb I generally try to stay away from nationwide chain restaurants so I really can only blame myself.  If you have read any of my reviews you know two things about me.  I am super picky but do not mind spending the bucks if the food warrants it  I hail from Chicago ... Used to go see the stockyards where the some of the best beef came from... Favorite Chicago steakhouse... Gene and Georgetti's  My point is I grew up with good meat and I know the difference!  We walked in mid afternoon knowing we would never get in at night without a reservation .   Greeted by several smiling employees... We Chose to sit outside as it is a beautiful day.  Service was good ... Food? Not so much...  Although I have never been , I am guessing it is similar to  Outback Steakhouse... Generic food.  Husband and I each got the "Manhattan cut" I believe the price $23.00  we upgraded to get the salad ( one of the most unappealing and boring house salads ever))...  The steak which was cooked correctly! (Thank you) but truly uneventful as well.    There was a thick piece of fat/grizzle on this small piece of meat and it took a lot of sawing with the knife to cut thu the meat ...  the seasoning was fine... Not too much... Not too little.  The double baked potatoe was ok... Just a double baked potatoe.. Nothing at all special and green beans were green beans.. No seasoning... Just beans   Oh yes... Don't want to forget to mention the bread... Small round of what I think is supposed to be sourdough... Although it was warm it was truly nothing special.  No dessert... As thus far it was clear we were spending good money on not so good/average food...no point in wasting more money.  I do want to point out the patio is a nice space with a fireplace and comfy Chairs and couches ... Perfect to unwind after shopping !  And the service was top notch... Of course the patio was not very crowded...  It is my opinion if you enjoy the chain restaurants like Outback and Red lobster and those types of places THE KEGis right up your alley!  If you are looking for a cut of real Midwest beef then you may want to go to EDDIE V's, or CHOP HOUSE or something of that nature...  We left paying the $75.00 tab knowing we would not return.  I suggest you give it a try and enjoy it for what it is!  I understand they have a decent happy hour...   Until then.....  Bon appetite'

Hello to all!  Thinking of taking a staycation?  So were we, so we checked groupon and saw a $65.00 rate... The pictures looked great with several heated pools and spas.... What a way to unwind!  Before purchasing the groupon I called the hotel to ask a few questions... I sat on hold over 10 minutes for reservations and was finally given an option to leave a message which guaranteed a call back... Of course it didn't say when... And I still have not received that call and I left the message weeks ago!  I called later that night and same thing... On hold.  I waited until Monday and called the hotel manager who was very understanding and referred me to the reservation manager.  I had high hopes..... Until I went online and read the HORRENDOUS AND SCARY reviews!    I spoke with Doug(reservation mngr) who did call me exactly when I was told he would.. Impressive!   At this point I was questioning whether it was worth the aggravation I had already been through.  I asked if they read their online reviews because overall they are quite scary!  Doug explained that the hotel had partially updated the rooms and guaranteed he would get us a room on the first floor by a pool.  Unfortunately there were no suites or king bed rooms with our needs so we took a room with 2 beds to be on the first floor and by a pool.  I explained how my husband had back surgery and cannot do stairs and I was assured he would take care of it. I also told him it was our anniversary and therefore a very special weekend.   All week we have been looking forward to Saturday so we can go play, soak and just have a romantic night.  We got to the hotel at 4p and what we found was what looked like your standard Arizona apartment complex! Lol  We were assisted by KELSEY who said she was acting supervisor and she went on to tell us our room was on the second floor!    I explained how we need the first floor room so she stood staring at her computer only to tell me she had nothing to accommodate us... Now keep in mind we have not gone away even for a night in a long time and we needed this getaway badly!  KELSEY said there was an upgraded room 8 steps below ground... What didn't she understand about..... NO STAIRS!  I asked KELSEY to call Doug and she said he wasn't in so I requested she call his cell phone... We all know he had one of those! She insisted she could not do that so we turned around and left and drove all the home  On the way home I received an email from the hotel saying how sorry they were we had to cancel ! ....  What a joke!  We had to change many thing around to make this weekend happen and I am not at all happy about this situation.  I even suggested to KELSEY "supervisor" she put us up at princess hotel next door she completely discarded that suggestion!  In the reviews a lot of people mentioned how the check in staff lacked personality and friendliness which I can back up!     This "supervisor" lacked people skills and does not appear to go the extra step to make the customer happy.  In a situation like this KELSEY most definitely should have reached out to Doug or the hotel manager ..  Even if was their day off!  In the hospitality business you should always be on call!  I am writing this review while it is still very clear in my mind... I am sure I will hear from Doug come Monday and I will update you as to whether or not he makes this customer happy!  So for now.... Remember to always take a moment to stop and smell the roses!

Stopped here today thinking it was more a restaurant than "just another bagel place". Unfortuntately it was "just another bagel place". There was an amazing selection!   If you call 4 different bagels a choice.... of course someone just bought most of the bagels....and I am guessing since the location is somewhat hidden they dont get the type of business in which they need to have plenty of bagels on hand.  And if they do have a big clientele...then shame on you for not having more bagels! I got a lox sandwich..the price was average 6.95 (I believe).   They reccomended the jalapeno bagel however I went with the sourdough which was a good bagel. My friend got jalapeno bagels which you can barely see or taste any jalapeno...little dots of green here and there. My lox sandwich was average....I asked for chive creamcheese...which I did not see any sign of chives...and instead of using rings or slices of onion they use a LITTLE bit of chopped onion...(I guess onion is a matter of preference). I had wanted some juice, but they did not have any selection other than a couple plastic cups of juice with lids...or the ever poplular "can" of apple juice! The employees were very friendly and the atmosphere was pleasant and comfortable. I would say the bagel is a wee bit better than chompies...but that is not saying much!   Overall I would say..... if you work close by and want a simple bagel and cream cheese, which I am guessing is most of their clientele since there are office complexes surrounding the place....it is an ok pick.... However....I would not go out of my way to stop here when there is a NY Bagel not too far away.  Bon Appetite'

Happy Holidays to my favorite Yelpers!  This will be my shortest review ever!  This place is one HOT MESS!  Our Doctor was contracted with them, so we complied.  Nobody contacted me to update me! I had to do the leg work to get it moving!  When I did finally did speak with a woman (I won't mention names) her reason for not contacting us was " you were on my to do list ".... Nice!  Not to mention she was snippy and lacked any friendliness.   I got a call to schedule his MRI as he was in their waiting room for his appointment.  Nobody knows what the others are doing   EVDI is the only place we will go from this point forward!  Reviews speak volumes... As long as they are honest...  I am being very honest when I say.... GO ANYWHERE ELSE!  Enjoy the Holidays and be safe

Hello to all!  Let me just remind everyone that I am a very picky person and hate spending good money for bad service!  No worries at this salon!   We had an appointment but got there early and was warmly greeted by Tom.  He got us started right away... My husband got a manicure and I had a pedicure.  The atmosphere was comfortable and inviting and unlike most  nail shops the employees weren't chatting with each other in their native tongue  instead of doing their jobs.  The pedi chairs were very comfy and they lined the spa with plastic... Which Is such a smart thing to do... Not only for the health/germ factor but it keeps the spa looking new.  All of the employees made us feel right at home... The water was perfect and they offered us water or coffee... And we are not talking about just any coffee... It was Starbucks coffee which tells me they spend a little more for the comfort and happiness of their clients!  It is rare that I am able to really relax during a pedi... I am either distracted by the employees talking or watching to make sure they are doing it to my liking... Not the case here... I could have easily fallen asleep.  As my pedi was going on I noticed Tom walking around making sure everything was tidy and that his clients were enjoying their experience .  My husbands nails looked great as did my pedi and we both left feeling refreshed and definitely pampered!  Will we be back?  You bet we will! And we will share our experience with everyone!  In fact I will start getting my nails done here too!  If you have read any of my reviews you know I RARELY give 5 stars... But Greenfield nails deserves each star!  Keep doing what you are doing because it works!  Thank you for a wonderful experience!  So... If you are reading this you must be looking to be pampered... Don't walk...RUN!  Go now... No time like the present to treat yourself!  And remember to live each day as though it were your last and enjoy!

Hello Arizonians!  I thought it time to give ya'all the 6 month update...  Anyone could have one good experience but are they consistent?  The answer is ... YES!!!  I am now a "regular"!  When I come in every other Saturday I am greeted by name... By everyone!  I have my gel mani's done by David who always has a smile for me.  We chat, we laugh and it is just fun and relaxing!  I have met many wonderful people and have even made friendships with other customers.  Kathy does my pedis and she is very sweet and pays special attention to the areas I need.  Tom is still always walking around making sure everyone is enjoying themselves.  It feels like "Cheers" ... Where everybody knows your name! Lol  If you have been here before, I am sure you are now regular... If you haven't tried them yet... No time like the present!  Go, enjoy ... Get your toes pampered... Get a mani... You can even get your brows done...  So many ways to be pampered here!  Hope to see you there!  Until then... Take time to pamper yourself...You only live once!

My impression of the New Al's.....  I was thrilled to see Al's was open again and stopped for a hot dog.... I knew exactly what I wanted but glanced at the menu to make sure it was the same and my eyes popped out of head!!!  OMG.....the prices have JUMPED!   I asked if the hot dog was bigger than it used to be..thinking that would be at least a reason for the price hike...one person said yes...the other owner? said no....  Turns out the hot dog was the same size...still a good hot dog...but I was not happy paying about $1.50 more for the same size hot dog.  Let's get to the fries...which I have always enjoyed as they remind me of the hot dog joynt I grew up going to in Chicago....the fries were o.k....but there was sooooo much salt on them and so many old looking fries I just couldnt eat them.  I am sure I will be back to try the beef...only because Lukes SUCKS....  Unfortunately now that Al's is charging as much as Lukes...their beef will  have to be pretty darn good to keep me as a customer.  Overall....very dissapointed....  Note to the owners...... You really need to have above average food to compensate for your price hike if you want to not end up closing down again.  Just because we are in Scottsdale doesnt mean we are willing to throw away money on bad food!

I promise this will be my final review on Al's.  My last review commended them on their Beef sandwich....ok...so heres the thing... If you get there at the right time of the day (when they open when everything is fresh and the beef hasent been sitting in hot water all day) you get a good beef sandwich(as long as you add the peppers for taste..which btw they charge you for),     however if you get there around 5pm the beef is soggy and tasteless.... sorry michelle and Burt but I gotta tell it how it is.  Now for a simple thing like a hot dog.... ok, so the dog is small, taste is everything....theres the key word....taste....  So heres the thing....if you order a hot dog, tell them exactly how you want the condiments, otherwise you will end up with a hot dog saturated in relish or other ingredients....now some people might like a little hot dog with their relish, but not me.  Now, lets get to Al's redeeming quality....the fries......  So heres the thing..... if you want overly salted well done fries then dont say anything, but if you want golden fries with salt to your liking(like the picture they show), then ask them to not cook them as long and NO SALT!  I have had several friends go to Al's and unfortunately have not had good reviews from them so I will let people read the reviews and decide for themselves.  Overall, if you want to stop at a hot dog joynt and have to dictate exactly how to prepare your food, then Al's is the place for you.  I wish I could suggest a good hot dog place but I just havent found one yet so if anyone has any VALID suggestions..... please share.  I will be moving from Scottsdale in a few months and when I do chances are I wont be back to Al's because it simply is not worth going out of the way for.  Al's is simply not consistent and I hate spending good money on bad food.  The owners (btw) are very nice, but nice doesnt bring the customers back  The decision is yours.....try it or dont try it but until then.......  Bon Appetite'

Ok.....Here it is from the girl who is VERY picky and can usually find problems with quality or price of food....  Went to Five Guys for the first time....  I am proud to say I could not find ANYTHING that could have been improved on!  I got what they call a small cheeseburger....it was 1/4 pd juicy and yummy tasting burger and quite ample!  You get to pick any of the toppings you want....impressive.....  They used the perfect amount of condiments giving the burger an evenly tasty bite every time.  The fries were awesome....we also tried cacun fries which added a nice bite.  I felt the price was reasonable and definately worth it!  For me to find this burger near perfect is rare....very rare.... I HIGHLY reccomend you check Five Guys out!

Although I have heard nothing great about this aquarium, there is nothing more tranquil than watching sealife! We went last Thursday during a promotion for $6.00 per person. I was afraid we wouldnt have much time to enjoy as we got there an hour before it closed....we were in and out in 20 minutes and that included time holding starfish and taking our time.   I would say paying $6 would be a fair price of entry, however they charge $18.00 for an adult!!!  Yes....that is right!!!  My suggestion is to rent Nemo in the comfort of your own home and keep the cash!

Hello to all my fellow foodies!  So we've all seen the food shows like Dives and drive ins?... Not sure of its name since I stopped watching after going to the recommended places....and finding out that that host guy definitely was not eating the same food  us average Joes were..   So....  I tried watching CHECK PLEASE... Thinking 3 impartial every day people were reviewing it... Hmmmmm.     Perfect example .... DC STEAKHOUSE!  Everything on tv looked so yummy and everyone enjoyed everything.. They must have know they were coming and made sure everything tasted good because what those 4 people on that show experienced was NOT what we experienced!  We made a reservation for our Anniversary and since it was a very early reservation had the pick of tables...  The Hostess was super sweet and wished us a Happy Anniversary which was lovely of her. We had a nice table by the window... Perfect to watch the incoming storms and of course the passer Byers   Our server was very nice ( I chose not to mention names) and he was happy to answer our questions as this was our first time there.  On the plus side.... The meals come with an EXCELLENT salad... You must get the blue cheese dressing... Chunky and lots of flavor.....and a choice of a loaded baked potatoe (up fee) but if you like baked potatoes you must get it loaded... They bring you a dish with the sour cream, cheese, bacon, onion so you can create your own or sweet potatoe fries ( also good).  My husband ordered the sirloin steak med rare and I ordered the ribeye also med rare.  The food arrived and they had his steak on my plate and reversed... Easy fix but... Come on... Such a basic mistake in the kitchen?  My husband tasted his steak and stopped to add salt and pepper!!!! He found his steak a little chewy...   So I cut a few pieces from the edge and sampled a bite of mine.. No way!!! A steakhouse does not know how to season a steak? Completely bland...   Now, I realize one never wants to over season a good piece of beef.. One should only season to enhance its natural favors.  I explained to our server and he graciously took it back and I instead ordered the same steak as my husband... Requesting a little more seasoning.. Not wanting to take a chance on another cut  A woman came out of the kitchen (manager??, never identified herself) holding the plate that was returned trying to explain the chef only seasons the middle and not the edges and did I want to try a piece from the middle?   SERIOUSLY??? REALLY?  That plate has been sitting in the kitchen for 5 minutes with who knows who looking and or touching it.  I suggested she take a bite of the steak and tell me what she thought... She didn't... But expected me to?   I declined.  By the time I got the second steak I had filled up on the sweet potatoe fries... so when the steak came I took a bite just to see if it was seasoned... And it was... Not much but not tasteless.    My cut was far tougher than my husbands also  I wonder if this is a new chef or a new beef supplier?  A couple cons... Other than the obvious tasteless beef... Although must give credit where credit is due.... Steak was cooked perfectly.  I would have liked to see the server come to the table a couple more times to check on refreshments or just to say Hi... Just checking :)  The bread is as  boring as the steak... A soft tasteless French bread.  Now to the pros...   The dinner salad was seriously good!!! ( well.. The dressing made it what it was)  And you must try some Tiramisu... Really creamy and flavorful  And of course the lovely hostess who was very friendly and funny and again was thoughtful to acknowledge our special occasion at their restaurant!   I questioned getting an Italian desert  in a steakhouse but as it turns out the they do a better Italian desert than they do steak!  If I would have read the YELP reviews prior I would have seen other people experiencing the same tasteless meat... I trusted CHECK PLEASE!    Next time I ignore the people being paid to eat and review their food and go straight to my fellow Yelpers.  That was the highlights of our Anniversary dinner at DCSTEAKHOUSE.  We each brought home our deserts and I brought home my steak  I think this place lures the locals who want to dine in the neighborhood...   It is in a nice location perfect for an after dinner stroll  That's it folks... Try it if you want... Just don't expect what you saw on TV   Bon Appetite'

Hello my fellow Arizonians......  As a reminder.... I am the pickiest person I know and detest not getting my monies worth!  Are you up for going to see a movie?  Give Ultra star a shot and see  what you think.  I have been here several times and there are pros and cons, so lets start with the pros.  The seats are quite comfortable and it is rare that the theaters are full (which right there should tell you something).  Thats about it for the pros.  Now for the cons.......  In "star seating" you can hear the rumble and noise of the theater next to yours, which is very distracting especially when they are playing an action packed show with loud audio.  We have tried to order from their menu two different times and the deal is you press the "red" button and someone is supposed to come take your order.  I have found this not to be the case, so we just gave up on trying and bring our own drinks and snacks.  My last con is, if you are sitting back in your comfy chair you cannot see the bottom of the screen because the seatbacks in front of you are too tall... I realize this sounds odd but I am not kidding.  I was at the theater today and I was told the show I was seeing was in theater 10, as the ticket also showed.  I sat in the theater (the only one) and the theater was very warm and muggy so I went in the corridor to inquire into some A/C and although I am not sure why I asked, I asked the employee to confirm the movie I came to see was in this theater at which time he advised me they decided to switch theaters and now the movie was in theater 8!  Had I have not inquired, I would have been sitting in that theater until the movie was supposed to have started to find out.  This was not the first time that happened.  I like certain things about the concept of this theater however I do not think they have it all together.  I understand there is another such theater called "movie studio theater" which I have purchased tickets for on GROUPON but have yet to use them.  I will them a try next time and let you know how that one rates....  Until then......  Live each day as though it were your last....enjoy!

I have ordered from NY pizza lovers 2 times now... First time we ordered a pizza which I thought was ehhhhhh....however my husband enjoyed it....(what does he know about pizza...hes from kansas-lol)  Our second time we got a calzone and a stromboli... Never had stromboli before and had no idea what to expect....if a stomboli is tons of bread and very very little inside ...then thats what we got...and ended up throwing away.    Did not care for the sauce it came with....we are not big sauce people...but do enjoy a good sauce...this was not it.  The calzone was very tasty....again...not very much filling but what was there was good.  The combination of ricotta and mozzerella was yummy.  What I must compliment is the employees....the man I ordered from (owner?) was very nice and delivery time was fair.

Hi to my fellow foodies...  This just might be my shortest review yet!  Good bagel.. Good cream cheese... Awesome lox sandwich....   Loved that they opened at 5am so I could pick up bagels for work but I went there this morning after missing my bagel for a month or two and they were CLOSED!  It seems they DO NOT OPEN UNTIL 6am...   Although I enjoy their bagels I don't enjoy them enough to go completely out of my way...  This was my breakfast go to place.... So sad they open later now....  So long Bagelman.....  Bon appetite'

Hello to my fellow Arizonians and seafood lovers!  For this review it is important I remind everyone that I am the pickiest person I know and do not mind paying the bucks but the food has to be worthy!  I have been waiting for the Lobster Lady to come back to Az for a year... I read a review last year just after she left town..   So when I read she was going to be in Chandler for Rock the Block I knew this was my chance!  My friend had recently been in Maine and experienced several different lobster rolls and was excited to experience this with me...  We found the truck around 1p and had only a couple people in line... It was $18.00 plus tax for the traditional lobster roll ... Pricey, yes... But come on... It's lobster all the way from Maine!!! Just doesn't get better than that!  We got our roll and found a shaded bench and took our first look... The bun looked and tasted like a hot dog bun with the sides cut off and it was quite small... Looks MUCH larger in the pictures but I am told they all have the same amount of meat..  The meat was primarily claw meat... Didn't see all the chunks of tail meat like you see in the pics... We cut it in half to share and each got 2 bites... Which again no biggie... The problem we had it that the meat was not super sweet... Generally the claw and tails are very different tasting... All we tasted was claw meat and we've experienced such tasting meat From the grocery store lobster tank... Very disappointing ...   Very important to realize at this point is food is a preference... As I explained I am very picky and if I am going to pay that price... I expect perfection or close to it!  Now we come to the part I want you all to pay attention to!!!!  I decided instead of just writing a review I would speak to the Lobster Lady.. And I did just that.... She was a LOVELY woman and it is obvious she is PASSIONATE about her products and proud of the fact that her husband is a lobster fisherman.  When I approached her I was pretty pissed that we just spent $18... Plus tax for what we got... Then I saw the look on her face and in her eyes I immediately knew I was speaking to a very kind, passionate and professional business woman who was extremely concerned about what her customers thought!  It's rare to see that... I felt like turning around  and not saying a word as not to hurt her feelings... That has never happened to me before! Lol  My friend and I chatted with her and she offered to gladly refund us!!! She made suggestions on what to try if we came back.  My friend and I were quite impressed and we would recommend The Lobster Lady!  Maybe it was just the batch... Maybe our expections were too high... All I know is it turned out to be a pleasant experience!  My apologies for not knowing her name but if you see her truck... Definitely give it a try and let her know what you thought... Good or bad she actually wants to know!!  Imagine that!  When I told her I was going to write a review but decided not to because she handled the situation so well... She told me I should write my review because she wants people's honest opinions...   I decided after much thought to write this but to also make it clear that we all have different taste and it is important to NEVER judge simply by one persons opinion/ review and to also TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!  Good luck on your visit here in Arizona and Safe travels :)  You are a truly wonderful woman and am very glad I had the opportunity to meet and chat with you!  Lobster Lady will around Phoenix area for a short time so get out there and get yourself some Maine Seafood!  Bon Appetite'

Hello to all my fellow Arizionians and snowbirds-  Its time for another exciting review .. I'll take a moment to remind everyone that I am the pickiest person I know!  And with being said....here we go............  I just moved to Chandler and noticed DEVILS KITCHEN tucked away in the corner of a little shopping area.  I read the great reviews and knew it was a MUST try, so my wonderful husband stopped and picked me up a "PIT burger" that I read so much about.  When he picked up the order, Cheryl said  she hopes we enjoy it and my husband told her to check yelp and she would find out! lol....Does that man know me or what!  First I will start with Cheryl who I think is the owner?  I called to place an order and Cheryl was so friendly and helpful, she told me she would make any kind of burger I wanted....what more could I ask for?  I told her what I like and she suggested the "PIT" burger which is a GIANT burger stuffed with cheese and mild peppers with just enough bite to give it a ZING....  The moment that burger entered the house I could smell how fresh and REAL the beef was!  Did I mention this is a GIANT burger?  Well....it is.  The burger was char grilled to a PERFECT medium rare!  As a rule of thumb I do not eat much meat but do enjoy a good burger and I found it...right here in Chandler.  The first bite filled my mouth with a blast of flavor.  And every bite that followed was equally as yummy as that first bite.  The burger comes with homemade chips which are quite good and not over seasoned.  I cant wait to try something else.  I give 4 stars....for now, until I try some other things.  If everything is as good as their burgers, they will  soon hold the COVETED 5 star rating, which I believe I have given only ONCE before!  Thank you Cheryl for reccomending such an awesome burger...we will be back.  I could go on and on but this is a MUST TRY, so if you are in the mood for an awesome burger experience at a fair price give it a try....you wont regret it!  and until then..........  Bon Appetite'

Hello there my fellow Arizonians!  Time for a riviting and HONEST review on LO ANN NAILS in Tempe.  Lets start with how I found them..... Although I rarely use Groupon (cause you never know what the heck you are gonna get!) I promised my husband a mani/pedi to melt away the stress and have a relaxing experience, so when I saw the deal of $49.99 for 2 spa mani/pedi reflexology,parafin,hot rock treatment I decided to give it a shot.  We were pleasantly greeted upon arrival and guided to our spa chairs to begin our relaxing treatments.  The salon is colorful which I liked.  The water was warm, definately not hot but I guess that is a matter of preference.  I really could have asked them to empty it and make it hotter but I went with the program.   I  had a male asian man doing my treatments and although I have never had a good mani/pedi from a man.... I again went along with the program.  I had the one guy doing my pedi/mani while they had a different guy do the hand and foot massages...... I found this very odd as it gets crowded have different people doing their "thing" in such a small space.  They put the latex gloves and hot hand mitts on, which I must say was the BEST experience I encountered.  To me, it was freezing in the salon and I welcomed the heated hands.  The guy who did the "reflexology" massages was in one word AWEFUL!  It was apparent this man had absolutely NO training in reflexology or massage.  He had no idea where the pressure points were ...but again, I went along with the program.  I have had MANY reflexology treatments and this was NOT reflexology but simply a bad attempt at a massage.  You can see where this experience is going so really no point in continuing to describe a TOTAL WASTE of money!  I will mention the nail color on my fingers was bubbled at the tips and looked ridiculous and as soon as I got out of the shop I wiped the polish off.  All the tips of my nails were not smoothef out and caused ridges so I had to give myself a "redo" manicure when I got home.  Before I bought the groupon I checked reviews on this salon and they were terrific which leads me to believe one of two things:  A- The people who reviewed this salon had never experienced a REAL mani/pedi.... and if thats the case you really should try a real salon  at least once so you know the difference  or  B- The reviews were from friends and family of the owners or employees.  With this being said....will we refer them to others?  NOT IN  A MILLION YEARS!  Will be be back?  ....  LOL   do I really need to answer that?  But, as they say....You get what you pay for and next time I will practice what I preach!  So for now remember.....  Enjoy each day as though it were your last.....:)

Hello to all my fellow Chicagoians and to one and all!  FINALLY ...... Portillios is here........ I warned AL'S ITALIAN BEEF  that once Portillos arrives people will see what a real CHICAGO ITALIAN BEEF tastes like....and hey AL'S....notice the price on the beef?   REASONABLE AND YUMMY!     So, PORTILLO'S has been open since TUESDAY (4 days ago) and it is MOBBED!  And for good reason.  Like everyone elses reviews.... it was the BOMB!  The beef was totally and competely DELISHHHHHHH!  Perfectly "wet" and and ample amount of beef and the sweet and hot peppers gave it that extra burst of flavor.  The hubby had a chili cheese dog which he enjoyed, but come on now....why do we really go to Portillo's?  It's for the beef and DEBRA'S wonderful, creamy, rich Chocolate Cake!  OMG.... The hubby thought I was crazy for talking so much about how great this cake was and after taking one bite of mine.... he quickly took possession and all that was left for me was the last bite....which was just as good as the first bite and even better than I remember it to be.  The lines were massive and I commend the entire staff for moving everything along quickly and efficently.  It was well worth the wait and I cant wait for the Tempe location to open.  GO.....TRY......It's a MUST!  Now you can try a REAL taste of Chicago!  Bon Appetite' and welcome Cubbies...to spring training

Happy spring to my fellow yelper foodies :)  Ok... So you know how all those menus pile up on your front door waiting to be read... And finally one day you succumb and finally glance thru them?  That's how my review starts!  Found a menu for WOK UP and wanting some Chinese decided to glance a little deeper into the menu and found some curious dishes.  I grabbed my tablet and reached out to my fellow yelpers .  The reviews were pretty mixed so I gave in and tried a few yelper recommended items.  The young man who answered the phone  was pleasant  and offered suggestions when I asked.  Although he said the " Spicy  coconut soup" was hit or miss he admitted he never tried it as he doesn't care for spicy... Thank you your honesty!  I ordered it hoping it would be a hit... Not a miss...  Also ordered sweet/sour chicken and potstickers ( which one reviewer said was great).  I asked very nicely almost in a begging way to make sure everything was hot and fresh... He assured me they make the food to order...just what I hoped to hear!  I even let him know that I am super picky and that I am a Yelper!   Thinking back now I guess I did forget ( when asking for it to be hot/fresh) to ask them to deliver the whole order!  I guess you know where I am going with this...?  Ding dong... A reasonable amount of time later the food arrived.  I was pretty excited to try that soup... I will say the soup was hot temperature wise and had a kick that burned ever so slightly down my throat but other than the burn there was not much taste.  There was one small shrimp and 2 pieces of chicken.  The sweet and sour chicken was ok... Your average stuff...  Nothing great nothing bad.  And the pot stickers???? Wait... I know I just paid cash for them? Hmmmmm  Now I am bothered by being inconvenienced by having to call and tell them they forgot the pot stickers... Of course they offered to send some out.  Again I asked to make sure they were hot and fresh and I was assured they would make new ones.  No offer made for their mess up....  Got the pot stickers after dinner was over... of course... And in all honesty is was not only the worst looking pot stickers I have seen in my many years of life but also the worst tasting!  They were hard and  tasteless .  I am sure dining in is a whole different experience but for delivery/ take out... No thanks!  Will we try again?  Nope... No reason to... We have HOT WOK (ray/McQueen) close and it is the same average Chinese fare but HOT WOK is closer to us... Food is consistent... Employees are super friendly and they cater to a customers wants.  And I think it's even a buck or so cheaper!   Remember as always... Never go by one persons experience....  Try it for yourself... You be the judge!  So for now... Bon Appetite'

Hello fellow Yelpers,  First time having to go to Social Security for anything... Needless to say we were not looking forward to this!  We were pleasantly surprised!  Got there at 9a short line... Moved pretty quick.  Your first interaction is with the security man who we found serious yet that friendly gleam in his eye indicating he was really a friendly guy just doing his job!  You put your social security number in a computer and out pops your number!  Easy schemzy!  Waited maybe 15 minutes and was attended to by a very friendly and helpful young man!  Needed more answers than he can provide so we had to wait for another... Back to the numbers board.  Only took 10 minutes until we were called and helped by CRISTINA.  Super helpful super friendly! She truly acted like she cared and was able to answer our questions!  Thank you to the staff for your excellent work!  Hopefully we won't have to ever go back... But if we did we won't dread it!  So in conclusion remember to always take time to stop and smell the roses....  You only live once!

Hello again fellow Yelpers!  Here's a little story about CITYIWIDE GARAGE DOORS.  They came 4 times for same issues!  Kept putting a bandage on the problem... Never considered just fixing it!  Finally ... We got a new garage door company over this morning after it breaking AGAIN last night! ..  Turns out after a certified technician checked it out it needed a LOT of repairs....  gear and sprocket is broken completely covered in shavings of metal...the rollers are in terrible condition and Everything they did was wrong!  After actually fixing the problem and putting new rollers on... It opens and closed smoothly and QUIETLY!!!  As other reviews show the problem is with the OWNER-KEVIN!  It is apparent he is by no means a business man!  Because I am the renter and not the one who paid him he felt it was just fine to insult and ridicule me....   He doesn't stop to think simply because I don't own this property that I have no friends and business associates who do OWN their garages!  The best business you get is word of mouth!  I firmly believe... If you don't like a service you tell the owner so they can rectify it and if you do like the service... You tell everyone!  I am not afraid to voice my experiences with KEVIN.  It's very sad he is only professional to the ones lining his pockets!  time to act like a professional!  That's it... Other than if you wish to do business with somebody like that... I only hope you have no problems that will force you to talk to KEVIN!  If so, prepare to be verbally abused... And ready to record him... Which luckily I did!  I also took pictures of EVERYTHING !! Every part that was fixed and or repaired or replaced.  I am prepared to back my review to any Yelpers who have questions  Keep your eyes open on u tube!  Enjoy!

Howdy Az Foodies  Don't you just love driving down the road scoping out new places and promising to one day try them.... and then  you finally do?  That's how this review will start... I went to get a burger from a place that used to be a burger shop but apparently is now this mesquite mexican and burger place?  This piqued my interest.... it's kind of like mixing an italian restaurant with a chinese restaurant...  I go to a mexican restaurant to get mexican food and a burger place to get a burger...but who knows... maybe they do make a good burger?  Never got the chance to find out what any of it tastes like..  It started like this... I walked in and there was 2 people ahead of me.  A nice man...looked like a manager/owner?.... greeted us and as they took orders found they didnt have the carne adasa or rice therefore they stopped production and went to chop up meat and find rice and no idea what else because we all just stood there waiting while this young female employee stood there looking dumbfounded!  The beans sat there on the tortillas on the work area waiting for ingrediants to arrive...I should mention at this  time that they took the tortillas out of a grocery store plastic bag!  I was hoping maybe they made their own?  After standing in this line 10 minutes I politely said to the dumbfounded girl... " I have been waiting too long and I think I will leave"  I said Thank You and left.  To be fair I know they opened not too long ago, so i think i will wait a few months until they have their act together to possibly...maybe try again...  Not sure they will be there months from now if they dont made some serious changes.  Good luck to you Julia's....  And to the rest of you......  Bon Appetite'

Hello fellow foodies ....  I am not sure why it says *** ordered online***... I tried but it never confirmed order so I called the store to confirm it went through and confirm order.  I will start with the positives...  Close to home! Great wings ... Nice and meaty and yummy choices of sauces... Always delivered hot!  Now on to the pizza... The first experience back when they opened we shared wings and a big ass slice... And that it was!  The pizza slice was tasty but nothing great.  The small pieces of sausages have barely any taste... The pepperoni is pepperoni... Nothing special... Not enough cheese  We have tried their pizza 4 times now and couldn't quite decide if we really liked it... We mostly went back for the wings.  Couple night ago we ordered a pizza that had sausage,pepperoni.. Peppers and black olives.  Pizza was NOT HOT... And they are only located a mile from me... Or less!  We picked up a slice and everything slid off the limp crust!  Neither of us finished one slice and the whole pizza went in the trash!  If you have ever read my reviews you know that I am fair yet honest and I DETEST spending good money on bad food!  It took an hour and 20 minutes to get our order but I understand they were busy...  I tried to call to tell them about our experience but the phone kept going to their fax machine which forced me to write this review before sharing my experience with them....  In the times I have gone in to pick up... Everyone was very friendly so it upsets me that we disliked their pizza so much.  Ya live... Ya learn  That's about it for this review... Stayed tuned for my next riveting review  Bon appetite'

Hello to all my fellow Arizona yelpers-  As the previous reviews say, this was a Dairy Queen , which if u read those review will show how terrible it was then..... Mostly due to the employees who seemed to enjoy playing and being Unprofessional rather than working!  So happy when I saw it was gone and and re opened as SWEETS... So we  decided to give it a try.  We got plain vanilla cones.... One would think... How can you ruin a vanilla ice cream cone... Well.... I'll tell you!... You create something you call ice cream but unlike anything thing you've ever experienced.  I would like to say that's is a good thing but honestly.... IT IS TRULY DISGUSTING!   I believe it was the owner that served us and when he handed me the cone I eagerly took a lick ... It is hard to describe the taste... Like previous reviews said... It tastes like bland whipped cream and is very thick.  I refused to even try more and decided to hold the cone for the 5 minute drive home so my husband can taste it and.... Wait for it.... Wait for it.....  IT DIDNT MELT.... AT ALL! What kind of ice cream doesn't melt?  The man who served us seemed proud to tell us  his ice cream has 14 grams of fat as opposed to DQ that has 8?  OMG! All those fat calories and that's what it tastes like?  No sense in continuing as first impressions are lasting!  I give him until the end of summer before he shuts down!  McDonald's is next door and has a decent cone... For a buck!  Get out there and enjoy this wonderful Arizona weather and if  you are looking for a creamy treat... Go anywhere else!  In conclusion... Live each day as though it were your last and ENJOY!

Hello fellow Yelpers ...  Anyone who reads my reviews know I am brutally honest... Be it good or bad!  As for SWEETS only been once.. Ice cream was horrible although I have never tried their food... The ice cream scared us away....  I wrote my review last April and never heard from an owner or employee of this business until they decided to have a RE GRAND OPENING and then alas... I get a message from BERTHA... The owner?    Suddenly she is concerned about our experience... Where were you last April?  Seems they have changed their ice cream and would like us to come to the re opening...  Unfortunately we were unavailable to attend because we do like to help our small local businesses.  I sent the owner a message saying I hope it went well.  No reply!   So I checked recent reviews to find 4 new reviews all within the same time period 3 of which are in the same town... Not Chandler.  I am a skeptic because I find it hard to believe 3 different people would drive to Chandler just for ice cream... Me thinks some friends are writing reviews??  Although I "could" be wrong...??  I feel reviews should not be bias if they are to be fair.  We will go back soon and try again and if indeed it is as awesome as these new reviews say....  I WILL delete this and my first review!  I believe in being fair!  Keep posted to see.... Does SWEETS really have the new awesome ice cream we are lead to believe?  Until then  Bon Appetite'

Hello fellow Yelpers,  I am going to save you a truly bad experience by saying... If you are in need of a GASTRO Doctor.... GO ELSEWHERE!!! I have researched and there are slim Pickens.  My husband has had terrible gut issues for 5 years... We have been to ALL the best rated specialists and the best we found was DR YATIN PATEL in SE VALLEY.  When my husband coughed up a blood clot we raced him to DIGNITY MERCY GILBERT and he was admitted.  They did a c scan on entire body and found he had Colitis.... How can that be??   Years of Doctors who claim to be specialists NEVER step outside the box to see what's going on yet one scan shows Colitis??  The only GI Doctor ( and I use the term Doctor loosely) was DR  SUDHAKAR REDDY ON DOBSON.  Now I realize Doctors not only have their own practice and have to make rounds at hospitals but this guy seriously rubbed us both the wrong way  Apparently he never lets the hospital or staff know when will show so the parents spouse or advocate can be there but it is always drastically different times.  He did NOTHING to help my husband.. No further tests.. He DID NOT LISTEN to the patient and completely looked down on me... Not sure if it is because HE IS PREJUDICE AGAINST WOMAN? Or what his deal is??  He NEVER asked my husband ANY questions other than do you have the last colonoscopy report from over 2 years ago!!!  We are in a hospital with every tool and test at his fingertips.... JUST DO ANOTHER COLONOSCPY!!!   We came to DIGNITY HOSPITAL because they CLAIM TO BELIEVE IN HUMAN KINDNESS????  The Nurses do but the Doctors?????  They are too busy over scheduling themselves not leaving any time for the patient...   How can they say that yet have this POOR EXCUSE OF A DOCTOR on staff?  After 5 days.... Yes 5 days with NO BOWEL MOVEMENT THAT JERK WANTED TO SEND HIM HOME!!!  I am not a Doctor but common sense says you don't send a sick person home in that situation!!  The nurses were ALL FABULOUS!!! And kudos to one Inparticular who "looked at me" with a very sorrowful look... Who then looked at the hospital Dr who does the rounds ( nice guy but he doesn't trust or go with his gut or what is best for the patient) with that same look ... The eyes were pleading the Doctor not to release him... Unfortunately it seems EVERYONE  at that hospital seems to be  INTIMIDATED by that Dr Reddy!!!   Hospital Doctor told me DR REDDY was very precise on his instructions to send my husband home... Even though he knew better... He was supposed to what was best for patient   Unfortunately having no idea this would turn into a gastro issue I was stuck with this Doctor, as DR PATEL works out of BANNER HOSPITALS  I told the staff Doctor I would NOT let my husband leave as he was violently throwing up the entire time he was there and had not had a Bowel movement in 5 days not to mention the abdominal cramping!  Seriously... Would those Doctors have sent him home if it were there own families???   ABSOLUTELY NOT!!  THIS HOSPITAL DOES NOT MAKE THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEST FOR THE PATIENTS!!!  THEY WANNA GET YOU IN AND OUT!!! Who cares about the patient!  I asked to speak with the HEAD OF THE HOSPITAL but instead the charge nurse came.  She was very patient and looked me in the eye and LISTENED.... DID YOU HEAR THAT DOCTORS AT DIGNITY/GILBERT MERCY MEDICAL CENTER???  Key word... LISTEN!!  Thank you Donatella for keeping him another night and for FINALLY GIVING HIM SOMETHING TO MAKE HIS BOWEL MOVE!!  I will indeed contact the head of the hospital!!! Furthermore I WILL PUT A REVIEW ON EVERY SITE I CAN AND I WILL BE FILING A REPORT WITH THE STATE MEDICAL BOARD!!!  Not everybody has an advocate on their side as my husband does with me... For instance read the other review posted... We agree.... DR REDDY IS A BAD DOCTOR!!!  BEFORE YOU LET THAT MAN TOUCH YOU... READ ALL THE REVIEWS ON HIM AND YOU WILL SEE THIS IS NOT A DOCTOR YOU WANT TO TRUST WITH YOUR LIFE!!  Furthermore... HIS ACTIONS REPRESENT DIGNITY HOSPITALS and because of this experience I will NEVER STEP FOOT IN ANY DIGNITY HOSPITAL AGAIN!!!  Don't trust you or your loved ones with Dr SUDHAKAR REDDY or DIGNITY HOSPITALS!!  Life is too short so take time to stop and smell the roses   Be well

Hello to all those Food Truck experimenters out there!  If you have never read my reviews there are a few things you should know....  First... I am a tough critic  Food is a preference and I can only review on my tastes  And finally... I DETEST paying good money for bad food or services!  Now that we got that out of the way I can continue my review.  I work for a big company that has food trucks most days... I have seen this ROCKSTAR HOT DOGS before at my company but never gave it a try, simply because nobody talks about it .  Being from Chicago I have had my share of a true " Chicago dog" and one of the top two important things are of course the pure beef hot dog and the STEAMED poppyseed bun.  I chose today to give it a try.... Boy do I wish I hadent made that choice!  I tried to play it safe an get a basic hot dog on seeded bun and crinkle cut fries.  The price was $8.00 which I keep kicking myself for paying!!  The fries tasted like Roach Coach fries.. Low quality oil that never gets changed... YUK!  The actual hot dog was good however the bun was horrible!  Not soft, not steamed and fell apart the moment I picked it up... Not good!  I had tried to find reviews online prior to trying one but all I could find was their Facebook page :(  I guess nobody has thought enough of them to actually take the time to review it....  UNTIL NOW!  If you see them at an event.... Please save your money and try anything else!!  In closing I remind everyone to take life one day at a time and enjoy!  Keep warm
