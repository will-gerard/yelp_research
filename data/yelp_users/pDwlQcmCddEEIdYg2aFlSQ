Needs help in all refrigeration containers; the refrigerated products are not as fresh or last as long as other store locations.

Love the Somosas here! I have tried many from all over and this is the best here in this area! Trust me well worth ever penny and calorie! All things on menu that we have tried have been GREAT! It is a place that for such a tiny place they sure can cook!

Not only do they carry all sizes from 0 - 4X, they are careful to carry things that are truely boutiqe quality! The prices are AWSOME and the service is better then any store I have been to yet!  The icing on the cake is there is no "Clothes Nazi" to have to deal with! Everything is also run on a simple way and easy for all to understand. There really is someting there for everyone! The art is out of this world!!!

Went there & no healthy options!!! All Sugar in everything & KFC or Churches tastes better!! Tea is bitter & instead of making a better kind it is turned into a sugar syrup
