Kind sales people, brilliant, whimsical design and pristine construction of Scott Gauthier's wearable art makes this store any fine jewelry lover's dream.  Even if you don't leave with a sparkler, you will leave with an enhanced knowledge of how fine jewelry is constructed, how dreams can be achieved, and a couple of really cool, heavy duty catalogues (one of them has a wooden cover!)

Some of the baristas here are not the most customer service oriented.  But some of them are really wonderful....and their chai is beyond delicious! Chocolate coconut macaroons are to die for.  And its a great place for a meeting or a quiet place to study.

My first experience here was great.  Spent over $150 on insoles, shoes and socks.  The second time was a huge disappointment.  I went in to get the whole shebang again, socks, insoles shoes and everything.  They were having some sort of race or event, there were tables set up outside and a ton of people milling around.    I was ignored for over 20 minutes after being told that someone would be right with me in the fitting area. The poor sales people were way understaffed but not one of them ever even acknowledged me.  When i got up to leave i made eye contact with one of the sales reps who was helping another customer.  I told her that 20 minutes was too long to wait with no one even speaking to me.  She frowned, said she was sorry and said they were understaffed.    I asked the sales person standing at the front of the store handing out coupons to people if i could speak to a manager.  She asked what about, i told her i had been waiting for 20 minutes without acknowledgement and she shrugged and said we are busy.  I replied that yes, that's what happens when you schedule an event and not enough staff.  That's not really a good reason why I would be ignored.  She shrugged again.  I again had to ask for a manager.  She pointed to the cashier.  I approached him and let him know he would be losing my business not because he has understaffed a clearly planned event, but because neither he nor his employees have made any effort to apologize or help me.  He said he was busy and didn't care.    I'll be shopping online from now on, or at footlocker.  I'm also not surprised to see that the owners of this store only reply to positive reviews.  It's the perfect example of why brick and mortar stores fail and online stores take all their business: they don't offer the customer service that we deserve.  This store doesn't offer any customer service at all.

Now, I've been a YC's fan for years, but, dangit, this is so much better.  The meat is raw and fresh, just like you get at the grocery store.  Every time i've been, the staff has been very helpful and organized.  The veggie selection is out of this world (they have baby corns!) And the sauces are quite creative. This is the spot: healthy, yummy, and they have one of those punch cards.  Love.

Our bartender was fun, accommodating, and knowledgeable.  Drinks and sashimi were on point.  Menu is very creative without going overboard.  And it's right up the street from my house! Love.
