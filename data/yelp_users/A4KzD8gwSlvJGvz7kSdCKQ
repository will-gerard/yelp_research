This place is A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. If you haven't been to Postino's, you are missing out! They have awesome happy hour specials - $5 for the equivalent of 2 glasses of wine (if that's your poison) or a mini pitcher of beer which comes out to about 2 1/2 glasses of beer. That little for booze?! Sign me up!!! Mondays (I think it's Monday...) all bottles of wine are half off! They feature a lot of local wines and hard to find wines. This is the place where I first fell in love with Moscato. I can't say enough about their Moscato except that it is delicious!  Their bruschettas are very tasty and hands down the best I've ever had. They get creative with their toppings and there's something to please palettes of all kinds. If I had to narrow down my top 4 favorites, I would choose: the apple, brie, and honey; fig, marscapone, and pistachio; the mozzarella, basil, and tomato; and finally the prosciutto and fig.  Downside - parking can be tough since this place is usually hopping. But they offer valet at a staggering price of $3. That's right - 3 bucks. Not too bad to have someone park your car 20 feet away. Also, the service can lag at times depending on how busy they are. But obviously those 2 things did very little to sway my 5 star review.

I love shrimp cocktail as long as the shrimp are de-veined. This place did not and I was unable to finish my $14 cocktail.

Loved the ambiance of this bar. They're pretty hip as their menu was on an iPad. If you like vodka, this is the place to be. I was delighted to see that they had potato vodka as I can't do liquor made of grains (gluten allergy). I ended up having a Moscow Mule (amazing!) and a White Ruskie (their version of a White Russian). While the White Ruskie was good, the MM was way better. Can't go wrong with a refreshing gingery lime drink served in a copper cup. We also got a complimentary shot of vodka with our drinks. How cool is that?!  Overall, the service was ok. It took us forever to get a server with the iPad menu and then to order drinks. Once we got our first drink, they became attentive and service drastically improved.  I didn't try any food but I heard that the wings were to die for. They were not GF. :(  I would definitely recommend this place if you're a vodka drinker and love Moscow Mules. Great drinks.

They were onto something when they named this place Dick's Hideaway. My friend and I felt like we were on a treasure hunt to find this hidden gem. We passed it probably 3 times as it is disguised with a sign that says "Additional Parking in Rear". No sign with their name but they are right next door to Luci's Grocery Store on the Northwest corner of 16th Street and Bethany Home.  Once we finally found the speak-easy like restaurant we were surprised at how small it was. There was a bar section that could seat a max of 10 people and then 3 booths against the wall. There was a room next door with an extensive wine cellar and tables big enough for 6-8 people. The room was dimly lit to give it an intimate feel but not too gag-me-with-a-spoon romantic as there were several flat screen TVs with the DBack's game on. They have a wood burning stove that gives the restaurant a campfire smell...making it seem that you're in the middle of nowhere in the wild west at a divey saloon (but much more classy).  On to the good stuff...I had researched the menu prior to getting there to give myself an idea of what they had. I was excited to see that they had breakfast and then sorely disappointed when I found out it's only served until 4 PM. Yelp considers this place Tex-Mex but I would have to disagree and say that it's definitely got a taste of the 505 (New Mexico speak for those of you that aren't in the know).  As I mentioned in my previous review, whenever I go to Mexican style restaurants, I will judge them by their enchiladas. I decided to be on the wild side tonight and try something different. I went with the Carne Adovada since the server advised it was spicy and I like it hot and a glass of the Malbec. My friend opted to get the red, white, and blue enchiladas.  While I normally love Malbecs, this one was more on the "eh" scale as it was too earthy and overly ambitious with the tannins. So if you like a strong red wine, this one is for you!  We got our food and they were not joking when they said the plate was hot. You can get third degree burns from those steel embossed cowboy-like plates. Also, if you are watching your calories or trying to control your portions...this is definitely not the place as the servings could feed two people.   The Carne Adovada was delicious...the meat was tender, juicy, with a red chile kick and topped with a layer of melted gooey cheddar cheese. The rice and beans were tasty and the homemade tortilla made the meal complete. My friend let me try her enchiladas and let me tell you - they do not disappoint! Next time I will definitely be getting those!  We were in a food coma getting ready to go home and put on the stretchy pants when we were informed that there was a massive dust storm taking over metro Phoenix. I felt like I was back in CO experiencing a blizzard of sand. So we decided to stick around for a bit longer. Good thing we did because we wouldn't have been able to try, by far, the greatest flan I've ever tried. Dare I say better than my mom's flan? Gasp...I would dare say so! The flan was delicately creamy with just the perfect amount of sweetness in every bite. I've never had a flan that was a mousse-like texture and not custardly. Hope you like flan cuz that's the only dessert they have there!  Overall, I give Dick's Hideaway a 4 because I can't give them a 4.5. The service was great and our server was friendly. The food, ambiance, and good company made the night. I will most definitely be returning to the hideaway known as Dick's.

This was my second visit to Tao and it did not disappoint. Booked the reservation on Open Table for 10:45PM and got seated right away. Decided to come here because you get free admission to Tao nightclub when you eat at the restaurant. You save about $50 bucks per person just by eating here. Seems like a no brainer.   Wait staff was great except when they messed up our sashimi order. They made up for it by comping us for the rolls and giving us the correct rolls. All of the selections were fantastic and tasted fresh.   We got 2 drinks and 3 different rolls for around $100. Not too shabby. Love the ambience and there was a DJ playing clubbish music.

Quik Trip is the best gas station EVER. Clean bathrooms, friendly staff, and a safe zone. There's usually a lot of cops that stop by to get drinks as well so there's added safety.  Never stopped in a QT that I didn't like!

This place is awesome!  My roommate, her niece and I came here a few days ago after shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square.   The ambiance is really cool with funky light fixtures and chairs.   Our service was top notch (Thanks Kyle!) - our waters were never empty and he was very informative about the menu.  We had the rings, totz and sweet pots plus the 5 various aiolis. My favorite was the spicy aiolis since the main ingredient was sriracha!  For the main course we had: the buffalo burger, turkey burger, and the chicken burger.  I love that they come in slider sizes because it gives you a variety of choices to pick and choose from so you're not committed to just one burger.   I will definitely be back for more and to get my drink on!  For a good laugh and pictures, visit my blog at:  http://www.adventuresofahungrylatina.com/2011/07/dont-judge-burger-by-its-size.html

Two words: Happy Hour. They have an awesome one that's everyday from 3-7 and all day on Sundays. Their appetizers, drinks, and sushi are all half off and there's a lot to choose from. I'm a big fan of their kinky kooler to drink. The pot stickers and teriyaki ribs are awesome. All of the sushi I've tried so far has been fresh and tasty.   There's a reason they call it happy hour, because it truly is the happiest hour of them all especially at Geisha. The music is rocking, the ambiance is cool, and the drinks are free flowing...err...maybe not free but half off is a pretty good deal!  If you want a decent place to sit, get there early as it gets really crowded from 5-7. This is a place I frequent while in Scottsdale.

Really neat coffee shop. I like that they serve adult beverages in addition to coffee. I had "Bobby's Special" which was a top secret iced coffee drink that Bobby made me. It was pretty tasty and loaded with caramel. The baristas are cute too. ;-)

I used to park at this place where parking was cheap - $5 a day and I got exactly that...cheap service. Finally I got fed up with that parking lot and decoded to give Blue Sky a shot. Good thing I did because they do not disappoint!   Here's a brief synopsis of Blue Sky:  *Courteous drivers who are always cheerful and have smiles on their faces.  *Round the clock shuttles so there's one always bound to stop at whatever terminal you arrive from.  *Clean and well lit facility that gives you the option for covered or uncovered parking.  *The option for online reservations which gives you discounts!  *A free cookie voucher at Paradise Bakery (who can resist a yummy cookie from Paradise?!).  *They are ready with supplies in the event that your car doesn't start...think dead battery, no gas, flat tire, etc.  If this doesn't convince you to try them, then I don't know what will. You gotta try Blue Sky! I promise you won't be disappointed! If you are, you will get a cookie for a consolation prize!

Don't let the neighborhood deter you from coming to this diamond in the rough. Tacos are fresh and tasty. I live in Scottsdale and struggle to find a legit taqueria that's not on the west side. Well look no further because Tacos Sahuaro will save you the trip. Did I mention I work a mile from here? This maybe my go to lunch spot from now on. It's that good. I think I might have cried tears of joy as I scarfed these bad boys down.   You walk in and there's a menu board with their offerings. Not a huge selection, but that doesn't matter when all you want is a taco. Screw Taco Tuesday. Fridays are where it is. ANYWAYS. I can't remember what else is on the menu because I was mesmerized by the selection of meats. I got my usual...    I ordered 4 tacos because I love to eat. Was it necessary? Absolutely. I got carne asada, pollo asado, carnitas and cabeza (i.e. Brain). I also ordered a Jamaica cuz it's my fave. They had horchata and another fruit agua fresca.   Once you order you take a seat where ever. They will bring you a red and green salsa, a pasty looking red salsa in a baby molcajete (danger zone heat in that sucker), and then sliced cucumbers, radishes and lemon wedges in a bigger molcajete.   Then the moment I was waiting for arrived...taco time! The corn tortillas look homemade. Not sure if they are but they were delish. I topped my first taco with the green salsa and a squeeze of lemon and proceeded to take a bite. Love at first taste. It got progressively better after the first one.   So if you're on the fence about this place, don't be. It's legit.

My friend had recommended Spinato's Pizza so I decided to try it out with her since I had never been and she had liked it. Spinato's is a locally owned family pizzeria that started in Phoenix in 1974. They now have 5 locations spread throughout the valley. Since I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, I was more than excited to try this new pizzeria especially since it was Chicago style pizza. The best pizza I ever had was in fact in Chicago.  We arrived around 5:30 on Friday evening and the place was starting to getting crowded. The hostess seated us in the bar area since it seemed like a more ideal place to sit versus the dining room. She dropped off the menus and advised that our server would be with us momentarily. We waited about 15 minutes or so before our server acknowledged that we were in her section. She got our drink and food orders since we had more than enough time to make up our minds.  My friend opted to get the Going Greek salad (side $3.99) and the Tomato Basil Bruschetta ($7.29). I decided on the personal 7" sized Baked Spaghetti Calzone w/meatballs ($5.49). I decided to not drink as I had to drive and I wanted to get dessert.  She got her salad and the bruschetta which she shared with me. When I think of bruschetta, I imagine it on a sturdy crispy piece of french bread or baguette  not on a piece of focaccia. Now don't get me wrong - I love focaccia as much as the next person, but focaccia isn't a sturdy piece of bread to pile on tomatoes drenched in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The bruschetta was good but did not blow me away by any means. It had good flavor but it's not something that sticks out in my mind.  Half way through the bruschetta, our server brought the baked spagetti calzone which was enormous and I got the smallest size! I can only imagine what the other sizes look like (out of control). It smelled delicious and had marinara sauce spilling over the top of it. I took my first bite and was absolutely horrified by what I tasted. The sauce was sweet?! Who on earth makes sweet marinara sauce? That should be a crime! It didn't even have the slight essence of Italian herbs that are a requirement in all marinara sauces and the sweetness was overbearing. I had to doctor it up by piling on the parmeasan and the red pepper flakes before I deemed it edible. I was able to eat half of it before I decided it was time for dessert.  The dessert was Spinato's only saving grace from getting one star from me. I'm partially lactose intolerant and can't eat ice cream, ranch or sour cream (I know my life sucks!) they had gelato which I can eat! My friend got two scoops of vanilla bean and chocolate and I decided to get pistachio, raspberry sorbet, and vanilla bean. The gelato was decadently smooth and creamy. I wasn't thrilled about the pistachio as I could sense the almond extract in it and I'm not a fan! The raspberry and vanilla bean made up for it. The raspberry sorbet was tart and sweet and mixed with the vanilla bean balanced each other out. We had to be wheeled out because we were so full...it was official - I had a spaghetti calazone baby! Overall, I was not impressed with Spinato's and there are better pizzerias in Phoenix that one can go to. I like that it's locally owned, a family owned business, and their gelato.

I decided to do a boudoir shoot for my boyfriend's anniversary present this year and it just so happened that DeLorme Studios had a LivingSocial deal that was too good to pass up. I was a little nervous about the shoot considering that I'm not the model type but Jeph did an excellent job at putting me at ease. If you are considering doing a boudoir shoot, remember this - wear what makes you comfortable and feel sexy. If you're not comfortable posing fully nude, then don't! Like most women, I have certain things about me that I don't like but there are other things that I do like. Go with what makes you comfortable and the rest will all fall into place.   Jeph is a true professional and is very good at what he does. I never once felt uncomfortable the entire 90 minutes that I was there and I would highly recommend DeLorme Studios to anyone who wants to work with a professional photographer. It also helped that I brought along my "immoral support" as Jeph calls it. My photos turned out amazing and my boyfriend reacted the way I hoped he would - jaw dropping to the floor like he had died and gone to heaven!   Thank you so much Jeph and Amanda for all of your help and hard work! I really appreciate it :)

AZ TMJ wasn't the first doctor I saw in regards to the issues with my TMJ as I had previously gone to Dr. Bernstein in Tempe. Put off by his lack of bedside manner and financing options, I did my research and decided to give Dr. Farrell a shot and I'm sure glad I did! Dr. Farrell has an exceptional staff who are professional, friendly, and willing to work with you. Becky & Linda are super outgoing and friendly and make you feel welcomed to be apart of the AZ TMJ family. The medical assistants are just as equally friendly and knowledgeable. In addition to the wonderful office staff, Dr. Farrell is a great doctor who actually listens to you and addresses short term solutions (usually the pain) and comes up with a long term solution to get you back to normal (splint therapy). He tells you up front the costs, what solutions he will use in the short term and then for the long term.  Now if you've ever gone in for a consultation for TMJ, you know that the treatment is pretty pricey especially if you have crappy insurance (like me).  Luckily, the office has a variety of payment options available to you in the event that you aren't able to fork over $1,500+ for treatment. I like that they have the option to use Care Credit or a payment plan which is something that Dr. Bernstein did not offer. Once you pay for the treatment, you don't have to worry about anything else unless there's an issue with your insurance billing.  Once treatment begins, you are in the office every two weeks and then once a month until the treatment is completed. I'm on month 2 of treatment and I'm seeing very slow process which is what I expected and what Dr. Farrell told me from the beginning. Part of the treatment involves a soft to liquid diet during that time which is a real bummer considering that I love to eat all foods, but my jaw wasn't getting any better so it's a small price to pay for the next 3-6 months until it gets better. That's what happens when you slip and fall in the bathtub and use your face to catch your fall...[insert sarcasm here]. Needless to say, Dr. Farrell and team are awesome and a pleasure to work with. He is highly recommended in my book of doctors!

I know this update to this review is a long time after I originally wrote the first one, but I had to think about what I was going to write. First of all, I will say that since I stopped seeing Dr. Farrell I've noticed a few things: 1. I can finally chew solid foods again. I went SIX months on a soft foods diet (i.e. couldn't chew anything harder than a BANANA). 2. I stopped using the mouth guards that were custom made for me and reverted back to the NTI guard my dentist had made me originally. 3. Pain is gone. 4. I have about $3000 in medical bills that I'm paying off for services that DID NOT HELP ME WHAT SO EVER.  Dr. Farrell is out to get your money and preys on desperation. How do I know this? Because I was desperate to feel better and instead of helping me, he made things signficantly worse.   Prior to visiting Dr. Farrell I had facial tenderness, jaw popping, the occasional headache and jaw tension. Nothing that was unbearable and something that I just dealt with on a day to day basis. Visited Dr. Farrell and I went from managable pain to excruitiating pain as soon as he gave me the anti-inflammatory shots. I'm pretty sure those shots just immobilized my jaw for 6 months. I was literally in hell for 6 months as I couldn't chew anything. I was on anti-depressants, muscle relaxers, insomnia medication, pain meds, etc. for all the issues that insued after the injections.  Fast forward to now...I'm off all medications, my jaw feels normal when I stopped drinking caffeine and cleaned up my diet AND I can finally chew solid foods and not be in pain.   People - save yourself pain and money by not coming here. This is just the tip of the iceberg.

Possibly some of the best pho I've ever had. I got the combo bowl which had meatballs, rare brisket and tendon. The tendon had a buttery texture that melted in your mouth. I was also impressed at the customer service as hole in the wall pho places are not usually known for their service. Our waters never went empty and the server checked up on us a few times. Definitely a great place to get pho off the strip.

Walking in you are bombarded with the smell of deliciousness that is waffles. I would go there just to soak in the aroma, it smells that good. Unfortunately, I can't eat the food there because it's not gluten free, so my review is based upon the coffee I got. My friend and I decided to come here because it was a local coffee shop and it wasn't Starbucks. Not a fan of their coffee. Tiabi's coffee selection was pretty good but their waffle selection was better. They had creative coffee drinks like the Jolt and the Snicker's bar which I got. My drink was ok...it a little more on the mocha side than I would've preferred but my friend's drink was amazing. I would definitely go back and get the Jolt next time I'm in Vegas. Definitely check this little coffee shop out. It's got a cool concept going on and who doesn't love waffles?!

I used Hertz through my insurance company when I got into an accident and my car was getting repaired. I had no issues with them until I got my bill. They did not disclose that the limited waiver liability insurance they upsold me was not covered by my insurance. I had to pay 100% of that which was an extra $250 tacked on to my rental car bill. I found out later that State Farm covers the exact same thing that the limited waiver liability covers. The Hertz rep also said that State Farm "highly" recommends getting this coverage. Let me tell you, that is a load of BS. I called in and spoke with a rep and asked to speak to a manager. I left a message with the rep as the manager was busy. Never got a call back. Hmm...I wonder why.   The only positive experience I had with Hertz through this debacle, was that I was able to drop off my car at Gerber Collision when I picked up my baby so I didn't have to catch a ride to drop off the rental. This was the only thing that gave them a 1 star. I may update my review if the manager ever calls me back.
