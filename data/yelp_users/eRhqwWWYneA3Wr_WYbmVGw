OK WHATEVER YOU GUYS!  I ate here last night and it reminded me why I like it, unlike everybody else!  For like 9 bucks I got a bowl o' soup, bread, a huge serving of yum yum yum spaghetti with mizithra cheese and dessert. And because I got the creme soda, I got to keep my cup. In my cabinet is an entire set of the old ones. Now they have newer ones.  There is a slight wait to be seated (at least during Mon-Thursday early evening hours, when I usually go), but they have old arcade games to play while you do so. The food was served quickly. And the servers always seemed over worked, but I've never really had a problem (except with trainees).  So yeah, whatever y'alls!

I'm craving a gordita and a churro. You know where I'm going...  La Tolteca.  Their menu is huge, they have a bakery for all your churro needs, and YUM.  Yeah, yum. If only it was open later...

I came here based on reviews comparing it to Eliiana's, considering I had never even seen it (it's pretty well hidden). And my philosophy is, any place with papusa deserves a shot.   Me & my BF went at around 7pm, and parked in the back. It felt a little creepy, but still...papusas are calling, so we entered.   It's a no frills establishment, with a larger variety of foods and papusas than Eliana's. We shared the sampler (for comparisons) and some chicken leg entree...it really wasn't all that interesting.   The sampler plate was pretty similar to Eliana's, but they give you more (for more money, of course). The papusas, however, were the bomb (do people still use that term? Bomb?). WAAAAY better than Eliana's. And I'm told the ensalda drink was WAAAAY better too, but that is not my cup 'o tea. The tortillas served with the main entree were a little dry, so I'm siding with Eliana's tortillas. Serves was friendly, but not quite the waitress type service you get from Eliana's. We ordered up front, and then sat down. Then the food was brought to us.   So basically, I still like Eliana's more for their main dishes and tiny cup of chicken soup. But I'll come here for papusa lunches....many of them.   Oh yeah!

OMGS you guys. This is a little diamond in the rough. Nice and cheap, with a modest, but DELICIOUS, menu. I share the combo platter with my BF and then usually get the chicken, which is so moist and tender and slathered in creme...  And it comes with a little cup 'o chicken soup which is yum-sauce.  Papusas.  Need I say more?

I have been here twice. And by "been here" I mean made it through the door and managed to stay for about 1 minute before we were met with the delightful attitude of the owner. I've never made it more than 3 or 4 feet into this cramped and overpriced store.   The first time we came in after grabbing some coffee from Dutch Bros next door. Upon entering we were greeted by a friendly "NO DRINKS ALLOWED!" Since we obviously look like the spilling of drinks type, we moved along and did not return for about a year. I guess a simple "can you please leave your drinks in your car" or some other friendly solution was inconceivable!   Recently, we reluctantly decided to give the store another shot since were out & about looking for mid-century treasures. This time we even left our coffee in the car, since we didn't want to be accosted by the owner. We entered. My husband saw something and asked the owner a question about it. The owner opened his mouth & gave him a snide remark. That's when we remembered how awful this man is.  So if you enjoy buying overpriced lamps from a giant prick, this is your place. However, there are several places in the valley with awesome finds that actually have a grasp on the value of customer service and aren't run by giant weiners. We decided to take our money elsewhere and bought a bunch of stuff from Modern Manor instead.

The only reason I come here....it's closer to me than the one in Tempe.  Otherwise, I would recommend the Tempe BE. The quality of clothes are better & the prices are better. I actually see no-name brand shirts with tags from Ross priced at like $14. Umm, I'd rather go to Ross and pay $7 for the shirt. The jean prices are a little higher here as well. And less sale items.

Well DUH!  I could eat their bruschetta for days and days. I think the plate is well-priced and perfect for sharing. And the bread is so soft....yummy! Oh yeah, they have wine.  Plus it was where me  my boyfriend went on our first date (and my first time there), so obvs. it holds some sentimental value.

All right, this place holds sentimental value, so forgive the obligatory 5 star review.  The restaurant serves a variety of sandwiches, which are great, and also tiny little pecan pie that I never tried, but are simply adorable. But I am not here to talk about the food, I am here to talk about the ambience of....THE FARM.  In Phoenix, it is hard to get away from the feeling of, "hey, I live in a desert!" But during your time at The Farm, you kind of forget that. And that is nice. It looks like, and is, a farm! If you walk a little further beyond the picnic tables and you will visit the giant cabbage patches, pecan groves, and loud roosters and hens. If you aren't up to spending some money, then just bring a blanket and a picnic basket & enjoy the scenery.  And, if perchance, you decided to get married, this is by far the best place in Phoenix to have your ceremony & reception. It's pretty freakin' romantic.  JUST SAYIN'.

I wanted a simple, yet delicious, wedding cake. We were recommended Honeymoon Sweets by our venue, so we decided to check them out. They have a variety of different cake flavors, of which you get to taste them all. The designs range from simple (like mine) to off-the-wall bonkers insane (if you're in to that sort of thang). Our tasting went well and the lady gave us some good pointers. At first, I was leaning towards cupcakes, but that option provides only one cupcake person, wheras a cake will lead to second helpings & possibly leftovers. GOOD TO KNOW!  We went with chocolate mousse and amaretto filling. The amaretto is so (mouthwaterringly) good.  My mom also ordered cupcakes from them for the bridal shower, their frosting is so smooth and creamy and the cake...delicious.  Totally reccommended.

Errrbody hatin' on Gold Bar!  Personally, I like their coffee (OK, actually I like the Iced Mocha). I went there almost every single day (sometimes two) through college, so I have some loyalty. Consequently, I think I put one of their kids through college with the amount of coffee I bought. I actually like the fact they don't have music blaring in my ear. It made Gold Bar a much better study environment. On weekends they do have live music (jazz, classical guitar). I can't say anything about the food, except for the yummy McTavish cookies. Sitting is limited. Hours are great. And they are still around despite Starbuck moving in on their territory. HISSBOO.  PLUS, they are open on Thanksgiving & Christmas Day for a couple of hours with $1 coffee. HELLSYAH!

Considering this is the only gym I've ever been in, it's great! They have updated equipment and lots of them. I usually go during one of the busy times and can always get on a machine, or do the things I want to. Plus they have classes which are good. And every time me & my boyfriend walk in & out of the Y, a nice gal at the food counter greets us and says goodbye. We still never order anything, though...  They lose a star though because I HATE WORKING OUT!  Sigh...

You're downtown, you want interesting pizza options without the 5 hour wait, and your hunrgy...  That's me.  Funny thing is, I actually didn't like this place at first, but now it's a first choice.  It's a cute little place with delicious food. Never had a problem, and rarely do I wait (but I'm an early eater). Never tried their lunch options, however.  I recommend the pesto salad, prosciutto pizza, and you need to try a crepe. MARSCAPONE AND NUTELLA?????? Umm, OK!  DROOOOOL....

Resonable prices for drinks that are well poured. The one bartender with the glasses is really nice and always remember my boyfriend's name. They make the best White Russians. The jukebox always has something everyone can enjoy (might I suggest Wreeckless Eric's "Whole Wide World"?) Great for people watching. It gets crowded on Friday nights (A-DOY!) though, so if you don't like crowds or standing up when you drink, I'd avoid the peak hours. I like you, Shady's. You're a helluva dive bar.

I'm a picky eater, let me put that out there. So the first time I stepped into Ticoz "Resto-Bar" and read the menu, I nixed it, decided on something else to eat, and avoided it for awhile.  Then one day I was starving and interested in something new, so when my boyfriend suggested the resto-bar, I threw my hands up and said "why not!"  Food was nice and salty! We had the gucahummus which was good. I had the tortilla soup, which is now one of my favorite foods evah! It's so delish.  Over time I've also tried the empanadas, which are just as delightful. They also have a "recession buster" plate for $5 or so, which feeds a hungry man pretty well. Not bad!  But the tortilla soup!

Michael Todd's is very inconspicuous. It looks like a bland old building, sometimes with a sign out by the road. My boyfriend & I found it just randomly driving around one day looking for home decorations, and decided to stop. I was thinking it would have a thrift store type feel.  NO WAY!! It's totally awesome. Even if I don't walk out of Michael Todd's with something new (that is actually old), there is always plenty to gawk at. They have a variety of styles, but a lot of mod/retro style type furnishings. They have some cute vintage threads (that clothes for all you un-hepcats) as well. Evenrything is in really great condition. Sales are pretty frequent, too. The couch I'm currently sitting on was purched on sale for less than $200. It's huge, clean, vintage, and had lime green floral patterns. Way better than what I would have ended up with at IKEA (but to be fair, we have an IKEA loveseat sitting in our computer room.)  Not a whole lot of parking, we usually park on the side street or behind the store.  Stay classy, Michael Todd's!

RHR is perfect! A cute little vinyl shop with something for everybody. I never leave empty-handed.  If you have someone hard to shop for, this is a great place to buy some unique/cute gifts that will definitely get a smile. Figurines & plushes, little toys & trinkets, artwork, clothing, and cards to boot. My favorite item has to be the stuffed mustache with a mustache that I bought my boyfriend about a year ago or my stuffed anatomical heart sporting a smile (ala I Heart Guts).  I'm melting!

4 stars for the grilled cheese alone. MMMMM, smoked gouda.  Never had anything else, nor am I going to venture away from eating anything but the grilled cheese. Nothing really appeals to me, anyway. But I come here a lot because the grilled cheese is just that goooooooooood.  Did I mention the grilled cheese?

Me & my bf went here on a friday night, and were seated right away by some "young punk kid." But he was nice enough to give us an extra large bowl of chips, so less "young punk" and more of a "nice young man."   We grabbed a pitcher of Dos Equis and ordered. The server was attentive, but not the most charming or friendly. But our orders came out as...well, ordered.   I decided on the flautas. I was expecting you average, fried, crispy, tiny flautas. However, the tortillas they used were large and still semi-soft. Quite delicious. I really liked the rice too...they have a hidden taste of chicken added.   So I'm sure I will be back considering my love of Mexican foodage, the location, and reasonable price. They are close Sundays and Mondays, I believe.

This my jam!  When I moved from Tempe to Downtown Phoenix, I was a little devastated that I would be out of reach of my home away from home, Gold Bar. But 'twas OK because I worked the night shift, so most independent coffee shops were open before I left for work at 6PM. So whatever my boyfriend brought home on his way home from work is what I would drink before I went to work.  But then, I got a job where I had to be at work at 8AM! Where was I to go to get my iced mocha so early that wasn't Starbucks and wasn't 15 minutes away?? I had been to Conspire before, but the hours were different. Then I learned they were open nice and early, and within a quick 1 minute drive from my home.  The coffee is good.  Plus they sell some cute, quirky items.  I visit it at least 5 day a week, so that warrants 5 stars.

Salright.  Their menu is OK. I'm usually stuck ordering onion rings because I don't really go for anything else on the menu since they changed it up (no chicken fingers? What gives??). I would order the cheese plate but it's $13 freakin' bucks now!  4 stars since I come here every Wednesday...got to keep my brain in shape with TEAM TRIVIA. And it's within walking distance for me.

5 stars because they brought onion rings back, you can order chicken strips off the kids menu, and I'm here every single Wednesday.

Expensive. However, they care that our darling pup (ok, she is 8 years old...) received when removing a growth from her butt (ok, now she is so embarrassed) was well worth it. We were referred to Dr. Koch. He answered all our questions & calmed all our fears. Even called for follow-up after the surgery to check up on our recovering gal. And now she is as spry as ever!

Meh.  That's about it.  The menu is small, but I guess that's because they are centered around their "awesome carne asada." It's nothing special. The corn was good, though.  Not worth about a 25 minute wait for takeout. I'll stick with La Tolteca, MMMMM!

I'll update to 4 stars. I have been back several times, and it's a very good location if you meeting up with a group of people. Variety of drinks, reasonable prices. They have a sampler plate for $4, comes with nuts, cheese, meat, and bread. Very nice little snack! The pizzas are thin, but good & filling.

Reference Robert R.'s review for my full evening at Tuck Shop.  However, I just wanted to add antoher 5 star review under their belt as I, too, was detered by the unfavorable review left here and thought it was unfair.  If you're not filled up by the mac & cheese and a starter, you may have several stomachs you don't know about. I left STUFFED.

I'm jumping on board the "I WANTED to like PastaBAR" boat.   I've been here 3 times. The first time was good, but pricey. I had whatever was on special that one night only, and it was good. Me & my BF also had the fried buffalo mozzarella with sauce and that....that was delicious.   The second time I went simple: Pasta with butter and pepper. I don't know how hard that is to mess up, but they managed to do so. I guess if you like to eat pepper straight from the shaker (or grinder, whichever you prefer) you might also like their rendition of pepper & butter noddles. But GEEEEEEEEZ, the pepper was so overwhelming, I couldn't finish and handed it off to my boyfriend, who loves spicy stuff, and even he said it was a bit too much.   So against my better judgement, I tried it again. I ventured away from the pepper and went towards the lemon & butter pasta combo. All the while I'm thinking there is NO WAY they can mess up lemon, butter, and pasta. Oh, but they created another overwhelming masterpiece! I guess if you enjoy covering you pasta with lemon Pledge, you might enjoy this dish. It was like eating a lemon head. All I could taste was sour lemon with a hint of pasta.   The mozzarella ball is delicious though. Expect to spend about $60 on 2 pasta dishes, an appetizer, and 2 glasses of wine. It's a bit redic.

Of all the newfangled "FroYo" places, this is the one I frequent the most. Of course, that is mainly due to the proximity to CenPho & their "twitter Tuesday" special. They have consistent flavors & toppings. I am a creature of habit, so I stick to the cookie monster with tiny little peanut butter cups. Yes, tiny PB cups, so cute! My experience has been that the price is a little higher than the competitors. However, I follow them on twitter and only go on Tuesdays now. They have a "secret" word that, if whispered creepily, gets you 1/2 off the price. So for two frogurts, me & the BF spend about $5. NOT TOO SHABBY.

Good mexican food in a hotel?  Yes.  It's a limited menu, no combo platters for $9.95 here. Mostly tortas, street tacos, and side items. But they are delicious, none-the-less. Really fresh ingredients. And their sangria really hit the spot, ifyouknowwhatImean (no skimping on the alcohol).   But the main reason I eat here: chicharron aka DEEP FRIED CHEESE WALL. It's like a grilled cheese without that pesky bread.

YUM!  I can't even taste the coffee...their mochas taste like chocolate milk. And I can guarantee there is some caffeine in it because I don't go though withdrawls during the day. And I don't even need to get out of my car to get it? SIGN ME UP!

Obs, a great location in the quaint Gold Spot next to the soon-to-be Pita Jungle. I really like what they did with the space. The vintage elementary school chairs bring me back to the days of learning cursive and pasting cotton balls on paper to create a snowman. Lots of natural light, too! The coffee is spot on, and they have pastries as well. -1 star for not having a punch card. They need to get on that!

Decided to surprise the boyfriend and have a little date here on their second day open. It was pouring outside, and we were welcomed in to the warm little home. For their 2nd day open & a Tuesday, they looked like they were doing well. Not overwhelmingly busy, but a lot of the tables were full. The interior reminds me a bit of the ol' Lisa G's, but with more use of the space and, of course, 8 delicious beers on tap for 5 bucks a pop, including (but not limited to) Ska True Blonde & 4 Peaks Hop Knot & 8th Street Ale. They also offer some bottles as well as wines. But it's an ale house, so of course I'm coming here for some ales! I heard they have happy hour from 11am-6pm.   They have a small menu consisting of apps, sandwiches, salads, and desserts, with nothing over $10. We started with the artichoke dip (DELICIOUS!) and I tried my hand at the grilled cheese. It was good & filling. I definitely will try something different next time for a bit more variety.   Thy sure got their stuff together for being open only a couple of days. I will be back. It's a nice little place to have a drink & a snack with some friends.

First time I walked in here I was thinking it was going to be Uno's. The decor was, but the food wasn't. The only similar thing is pizzas, but their pizzas are of the flatbread kind.  Although I am totally missing the deep dish pizzas, I guess I have exchanged it for cheese and truffles galore. Me & my husband were speaking with the waitress during our last visit and she said that the head chef was crazy about cheese & truffles. Well, sign us up. The menu is simple, but can cater to all appetites. Pizzas, burgers, cheese plates, and a array of appetizers (that include, but are not limited to: truffle fires & pesto stuffed artichokes?!?! Yes.). I've tired the grilled cheese, that comes with a side of brie sauce infused with truffle that really hits the spot, but for $9.75 you really kind of expect a side of fries or a salad. The pesto stuffed artichokes are highly recommended. I also tried the margarita pizza, which was pretty good. Service has never been lacking.  Recommended for a dinner & a movie or if you are in the area and looking for a quick nosh that involves a lot of cheese and/or truffles, and really, when aren't you?
