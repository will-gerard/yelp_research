Love this cute little community. It has everything you can imagine from three beautiful sparkling pools with cabanas, to little green belts to walk, free ice cream and other frozen treats in the main office, movies to rent and friendly staff. I think the biggest take away is the timeliness of maintenance....they fix any issue you may have immediately. I lived in San Carlos for a year too, but maintenance was horrid...it took days even weeks to fix...that's if they even remembered! My lease is up shortly and I'm hoping to renew if prices stay fair. I have two daughters so feel very safe in this neighborhood. I would recommend this complex to anyone! : )

Ok, first let me start by saying...car problems are something I dread, and because of this tend to wait until things hit the fan to take it in. Well, things hit the fan and I was forced to search for a mechanic. I was not a paid customer until three days ago, but have been a "customer" in a sense for a few months. What I mean is, I called this shop a while back asking if they could tow my car, Alex informed me they do not tow...but was incredibly friendly, helpful and referred me to a tow truck driver...he went above and beyond even though I hadn't paid for anything. On top of the excellent Yelp reviews and customer service Alex gave, I knew exactly where to take my car when it finally died on me. Called the store and Chandler picked up the phone, he was super helpful, knowledgeable and I knew I could trust him.  They gave us an estimate and were able to get it in quickly. They did what they needed to in order for us to drive it safely again, but did recommend a few things for us to do down the road. It was nice to not feel pressured into having additional things done, especially after shelling out a bunch of money on something unexpected like car hiccups. Appreciate this company, and will most definitely be a forever customer as long as we are in Scottsdale, AZ.  Sidenote: they do have a 5% off invoice check in offer on Yelp which was nice...it didn't save us a ton but shaved a bit off the top of spend. Check these dudes out, I'm positive your experience will be just as great! Thanks guys! ; )

My dream grocery store- yup no joke. This store has everything from exotic fruit, wine bar...whaaa?!?)to a Cold Stone Creamery right smack in the front if the store.  Oh and I can never get out of there without grabbing some fresh rolled sushi- they have a huge selection and always have guys behind the sushi bar making it. Silly to leave a review about a dang grocery store- but this one takes the cake!

I'm a little lost as to why this Dunkin gets bad reviews- maybe it's because it's in North Scottsdale surrounded by a pretentious demographic with ridiculously high standards. I find the employees to be very nice and delightful. it's a fast good joint for heavens sake. They always have all the product they advertise and the food is always delicious!

Meh- over priced and not that great. Maybe after watching the "Great Food Truck Race" this truck will forever be tainted with  cattiness and unethical principles. The valley is filled with many tasty eclectic eats...no need to waste time or money here- you'll leave with an empty wallet and unsatisfied tummy!

They constantly say "we are the church for people that don't like church"....this rings pretty true to me. Been turned off by many of churches, but this place ROCKS. In fact it rocks so much, I'm leaving a YELP REVIEW...whhhaaa? FIrst, Pastor Travis is a rockstar, I have yet to leave a service uninspired. The band is incredible and incorporates Top 40 pop/rock songs as well. Ever since they played Taylor Swift "Shake it Off" my 5 year old daughter sits in on every service instead of going to Sunday school with the other kids...which I find hilarious. So Band, if you're listening, can you please play it again for the sweet curly haired girl in the front row? They are constantly having fun events on campus with free food trucks, rock climbing walls, bouncy houses etc....definitely a huge draw aside from the incredible messages you get every Sunday. Oh, and the free espresso machines...don't get me started on those dang espresso machines...I go to bed every Saturday night excited to drink one the next morning. Plus getting greeted every Sunday by former Cardinals player Andre Wadsworth (he started the church) is pretty flipping awesome too! Check Impact out, promise you'll be hooked.

Amazing, I am officially addicted to the Green Glory juice and my hubby loves the   Jacked Up PB&J-great for all the protein addicts out there. Their food is fresh and delish!

When Portillos opened in Scottsdale I was beyond thrilled- having grown up in Illinois and frequenting Chicago- this spot is one of my favs. From their Beef and cheddar to their butter soaked cheeseburgers this place takes the cake. Perfect place if you're looking for a quick bite to eat but not wanting to compromise quality. They have salads as well, but from what I'm told these are flown in frozen then thawed- whereas the burgers are fresh. If you're craving something sweet- the chocolate cake is delish too! Perfect for the kiddos as well.

These guys are amazing! We used them in our last move- friendly, honest and extremely hard working. They moved our 2 bedroom apmt----and we have a tooonnnnn of crap- including a very heavy solid wood bunk bed. They were quick and efficient and very careful. Since using them I have recommended them to multiple friends that were moving. They also have a yelp coupon- mention it when scheduling time and they will honor it without having to purchase through yelp- this saves you hassle of placing a credit card on file and allows them not to lose money.

Clean and teenagers behind counter are always friendly. They constantly have new yummy flavors to try. The only downside here is that this franchise doesn't offer any checkin or yelp deals like the one on Scottsdale Rd.

I do not understand the bad reviews from other Yelpers. This place is fantastic, yes I agree the staff behind the counter isn't always 100% on their game but non the less, food is always delicious. Not sure about you, but I go to a quick eat place like this b/c I'm hungry and want tasty food, not to get praised and smiled at by teenagers behind the counter. If you're still leery of the reviews, go in for Taco Tuesday- all their tacos are $2 so give it a go.
