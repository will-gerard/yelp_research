I love Red Dragon and have been coming here about 4 years. I have been meaning to write a review this entire time. Food is always good, they never have an "off" night... Quality is consistent. Food is ready quickly, and you get very large portions. They have great lunch specials too (every day of the week). I highly recommend! This is my go-to Chinese spot.

This place does a really good job at gel manicures... However I am unsure about the customer service. Today the owner had sat me in one seat, then had me get up and move to another seat so she could prep my nails for my manicure. Soon after another customer came in and said she had an appointment, so I was asked to get up and move (AGAIN... even though my manicure process already started) so that the owner could help the other lady with the appointment. Then I was told to wait until someone was available. I found this to be very rude.. My salon service had started and was interrupted... Then I was not told how long I would have to wait. (I know the other lady had an appointment, but the owner shouldn't have started with me if she couldn't give me service.) So I waited and was eventually  helped by the gentleman who works there. He a great job painting my nails, however, when he was clipping my cuticles, he was being very rough. It was painful and I am surprised I didn't bleed. Also, when he was painting my nails and needed my other hand, he would tap hard/impatiently on my opposite arm. I was definitely put off by that. I plan on finding a different salon. The only reason I give 2 stars is because of how nice the manicure looks... I would give 0 stars for customer service and appreciation. Also, I never saw a worker wash their hands when they moved from customer to customer. :/

Food was excellent, you have to try the pancakes!! You can get them on the side in place of toast, so that is pretty awesome. Their coffee is probably the best I have ever had at a restaurant, so you should try that as well. The food came out super quick which is always a plus. I would highly recommend checking this place out. The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because the hostesses were NOT friendly at all. But, it was early Saturday morning so I guess who could blame them? Anyway overall it is a great breakfast place to hit up if you're in the area.

I love Bare Necessity and will NEVER go anywhere else. I found Amy (the owner) on Groupon originally 5 years ago and followed her to her new location. I have seen her and another girl, Aubrey. They are both excellent!! The building is adorable; love the decorations. It is very quaint and relaxing there. I will continue to recommend this place to anyone who is in need! GO!!

I bought a Groupon and came here earlier this year for a cut, color and some highlights. I was told that since I wanted "caramel" colored highlights that I would have to pay extra (I was told that my Groupon included blonde highlights and would require additional haircolor for the caramel look)... $40 extra to be exact. I had never paid to have my highlights be a certain color elsewhere (especially THAT much), but I wanted it done so I accepted the price. (BTW... I was quoted a different price for the caramel highlights on the phone by a different employee in advance; told him my hair length and everything. When I got to the salon the owner had told my stylist to charge a higher price. When all was said and done, I still paid a total of $165 for everything... Ouch!) The stylist was very sweet but the highlights came out blonde. Ugh! This is what I specifically paid extra to NOT have. After I got home, I decided to call and ask for a redo on the highlights. They fit me in right away which was the only upside. When the stylist was done, she said that if I wanted my hair dried I would have to pay $25 per owner's rules. Really? I felt like I was being punished for wanting my hair redone... Even though it was NOT what I asked or paid extra for originally. What kind of business lets their unsatisfied customers leave with a wet head, not having a way to know what their color truly looks like? Very unprofessional. When I got home, the color still wasn't what I wanted but at that point I figured what's the use? If you read the other reviews, you'll see how poorly people are treated if they aren't happy. This place does not care at all about customer satisfaction.

This location is right by a LA fitness, so the setup of the restaurant is kind of awkward. There are tables outside on what would be considered a patio, but it isn't really a patio as much as it is the front of the building. So when you're eating outside, everyone who is waiting for a table is in the same area as you and gets to watch you as you eat. Our server only dealt with us when she took our food order and dropped off the check. Someone else brought our drinks, food, and to -go boxes. My boyfriends french toast was dry and my eggs were ice cold. Luckily my pumpkin pancakes were excellent.  We could have sent them back, but it took us over 20 minutes to get our food and we never could find our server, so we just ate what we had. Pretty sure it isn't worth visiting again.

This place is okay. I have been here twice for food. The last time I dined here, I felt like I was unknowingly part of a comedy sketch or something. I ordered sliders with fries... My slider had a hair in it. I informed the server (who was very nice) and he sent my food back. I kept my fries so I could have something to eat while my friend ate. I waited for my food, and I kid you not, I waited 45 minutes for them to be delivered. They would have been ready before then but they got taken to the wrong table. My server kept checking back to see if I had my food... Nope. But he didn't seem to have the sense of urgency to get my food out to me, especially having it take that long. He took my fries away and said he would bring me fresh ones with my sliders... Okay. Finally, my sliders came out, but with the wrong type of fries. They really couldn't get this food out to me correctly... There was no rush to make sure I had my food, and my friend was long since finished with his food before I FINALLY got mine. The server comped my food and drink which was nice, but the fact I had to wait that long, for sliders, and the fact that I had my fries taken away and replaced with the wrong ones, was definitely a joke. Will not eat here again. Might come back for a drink though (maybe).
