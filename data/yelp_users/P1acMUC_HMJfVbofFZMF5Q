I lived here from 2006-2008 and it doesn't sound like it has changed. My friend's cars were towed. My car was towed from my parking spot, etc.   Biggest issue: My roommate and I were attacked in my apartment by a sex offender who wandered into the complex and was profiling us. SAN MARIN DID NOTHING. The management was interviewed by the police and they were sent the report. They blamed us and said our door must have been unlocked (It was not). Luckily our lease ended the following week but we got the hell out ASAP. To add insult to injury, they charged us $200 over our initial security deposit.

I brought Zizzio's a pair of pants I wanted to make ankle length. They were from H&M but I thought bringing up the length would make them lay better. They did an excellent job! Super quick measurements. I came back a couple days later and that change made a $30 pair of pants look so much more expensive. That's the mark of a good tailor.

Everything I've eaten is amazing! Very authentic Italian food. Not a lot of space to eat in the store because it is a grocery store too, but great to take home and eat with the family. I've purchased meat sauce from here for pasta and just saved the rest for other meals.

I've been going to Stingray for several years now and it's one of the best sushi restaurants in the Valley. The Morning Dew roll is my absolute favorite and they're always adding new, unique rolls to the menu. I'm writing because I was especially happy with our service last week! Our server, I think her name was Megan, was adorable and absolutely on top of everything. There are some dining experiences that make you leave the restaurant feeling good about your day because you're treated so well. Last week was definitely one of those experiences. With customer service lacking now-a-days, I thought I should write in and reward such a great dining experience. Thanks Stingray! I'll definitely be back!

Service for my car has been good.   The purchase process was a nightmare. Like a previous review about cruise control, I purchased the car with the understanding it had Bluetooth. I even asked the sales person if I would have trouble installing the Bluetooth myself when I got home. He said it was easy. I get home and no Bluetooth in my car.   Later, my car was hit and I called the dealership to do my due diligence of letting the company know my leased vehicle had been in an accident. They asked me to bring my car to the dealership. Then they proceeded to forcefully tell me that I "devalued" the car by being in an accident and according to the lease, I would owe them about $3,000 anyway...so I should just put that as a down payment into a new car. I had read the lease agreement back and forth and new that this was false and it was a scare tactic to purchase another car. I reported Chapman to Volkswagen of America and every VW dealership I've been to since has apologized to me for that misleading exchange.  As a woman, I unfortunately assume that people will try to take advantage of me when I'm negotiating for a car, but to explicitly manipulate the truth and use scare tactics for the purpose of the sale is beyond unscrupulous.   Irony is, I love my Jetta and would consider leasing another. It will just have to be from a dealership with higher integrity.

I'm a big fan of Saddle Ranch but not this location. I got charged $25 for 2 drinks and I had to sit next to a dirty dish rag and a beer tower that had been tapped for at least an hour. Drinks were actually less expensive inside the stadium by $10. I think I'll stick to the one in Scottsdale and actually save money.

Great customer service! I was slightly annoyed that I made an appointment and had to wait. But the friendly staff made me quickly forget I had been waiting around. The hair wash was relaxing and the blow out looked awesome. Better than anything I could do at home, that's for sure! I guess I signed up for a head massage that I didn't get. I honestly didn't notice because the wash was so relaxing. They felt so horrible they gave me a gift certificate to take home with me for my next appointment. I will definitely be back. They make it so easy to feel glamorous!

Loved Nekter's acai bowls. I've had them twice now and it's great to see the calorie count and read the list of ingredients that go into them. The first time I went it took some time to get my bowl, so the second time I called ahead and had no problem getting in and out. Bright, fresh atmosphere and SUPER helpful and courteous staff.

Great acai bowl. I'm on a kick right now and the ingredients tasted so fresh and the portion was generous. It's 100% organic, so don't expect basic Jamba Juice smoothies. It was more on the expensive side of acai bowls but the portion made up for it. It's also located in a cute boutique/yoga type space. Lot's of fun/dangerous shopping to be had while you wait for your food.

Excellent moving service. What they advertise is what you get. REALLY, no hidden fees or extra charges or anything I had heard nightmares about. I found them on yelp and 100% of everything said is true. I moved from North Phoenix to Tempe and was so worried about hidden "transportation" charges or "gas" charges or even "stair" charges. They were so pleasant and worked faster than I even thought it would be. Will recommend them to anyone who is moving again. A+++ and I paid them!

I couldn't be more happy with how they treat my dog Waffles. They recognized that she was shy and needed some extra love to feel comfortable when I first brought her in. Now she's so excited every time I bring her in for daycare. I work long hours, so to have the flexibility to pick up my dog after 5 p.m. is a life saver. They take lots of photos and videos of the dogs and post to their Facebook page, so you can check in on how they're doing throughout the day. When I board, they email a status update specifically on Waffles and her stay with them.
