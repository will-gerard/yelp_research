Great food and always very polite with the service. The chicken black bean is my favorite.

One of my worse experiences ever. From the silverware being dirty to a dry lemon for the beer it was just a terrible experience. From the get go half of the menu was eliminated as an option for being too spicy. The service was outstanding but the quality of the food does not merit a 20 dollar per person plate.

After patiently waiting online the cashier without any qualms, concerns or apology decided to take the order of the gentleman behind me. She even called him by his first name "Tom" as if by calling him by his first name made it ok to skip me. I just left the building after that.
