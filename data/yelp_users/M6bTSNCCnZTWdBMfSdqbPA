Great baby back ribs, tenderloin tips, fried pickles, flat iron steak. One of our group of four just had the salad bar and describe it is simple, fresh...perfect.  Real western motif inside and out. One word of caution, smoking is allowed outside so if that bothers you this may not be your place even though there were very few smokers.

Have been to Teds somewhat frequently over the past 2 years. The staffs is friendly, efficient and thorough. The lanes are basic, clean and dependable. Business seems consistent and when there is a wait for a lane, it isn't usually very long. The customer/ shooter mentality seems safer then other ranges in the area.

Very busy Saturday night. 30 min. wait for 3 people. Mourn party ordered 2 salads and the Chicken Enchilada Stack.  The salad plates looked small but were deep...plenty of food all the way around. No room for desert. Would definitely come again.

I have been here 3x...1st bad experience.  Yesterday, I had about 20 minutes to order and take-out.  After waiting waiting as the #2 customer in line for close to 15 minutes, I had to disappointedly leave with an empty stomach. They take there time in cooking orders and seemed to forget or take for granted the many customers waiting.   Their food is great and fresh, they need to be more customer attentive and timely in taking orders.   Disappointed at the lack of customer care, I'm rating 1 star for service.

If there is such a person as a personal shopper of defensive weaponry and it's accoutrements,  then Brian at PD Warehouse is the one. From practical advice on type of weapon, support equipment, ammo, refurbishment, training or even type of conceal-carry purse, pack or pouch, Brian Kovacs has the honest understanding of an individual/groups defensive need(s) and give straight forward, practical advice. His prices and custom work are exceptional. I send everyone I know to PD Warehouse.

Great food, great people!  The owners, husband/wife team have a great product and down home service. The owner's father(in-law) is on hand as well to offer help as well as schmooze. A great, simple place...better BBQ then I've had anywhere else in the world and that includes Texas.

Rigo Dirazo and his entire team run a first rate place and experience. Professional, smooth and fun. Great for the entire family or single individual.  A must experience place...I will be back MANY times!
