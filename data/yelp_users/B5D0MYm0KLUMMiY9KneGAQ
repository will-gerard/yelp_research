My best friend from Denver and I went to this nail salon when she was in town based on the perception that it served wine with a pedicure.  Nope.  We were not even offered bottled water, and while more expensive than those offered by other similar nail salons, the pedicures we received were subpar and our nail techs were not the least bit friendly. There is such a selection of nail salons in this vicinity, I will not be returning the Desert Nail Spa.

I lost a filling in my front tooth and called Dr. Katz's office, as it popped up on my insurance plan, and I needed to find a new dentist upon moving up to Scottsdale anyway.  Darla was extraordinarily pleasant and accommodating on the phone and got me an appointment for the next day, which included a full exam and cleaning.  The office is very pretty and cozy, and Lucy, my hygienist, was very kind and knowledgeable.  When it came to replacing my filling, Dr. Katz was quick, efficient, and did a beautiful job!  I highly recommend this dental practice.  It is very apparent Dr. Katz and his staff truly cares about their dental patients. :)

I started using House Spouse in July 2013 after my former house cleaner's services had been deteoriating for months.  I should have switched companies ages ago!  Not only do the HS cleaners do a very thorough, conscientious job addressing all of my home's common areas AND under the beds/living room furniture, Casey provides meticulate customer service to ensure the service meets my family's standards.  Moreover, HS is so reasonably priced, I don't feel guilty having my home cleaned regularly.  I look forward to them coming every month!  Another nice touch is Casey's personal follow up after each cleaning to ascertain nothing was overlooked.  He even offered to come back to my home himself to address any issues, if need be.  It is evident he takes a great pride in his company, and it shows in the quality of its service.  I highly recommend House Spouse as a regular addition to any household.

I purchased a custom spray tan from Foxy Spray Tans in preparation for my 20th high school reunion in November.  It was the first time I ever experienced an airbrush spray tan, and I was a little nervous.  Right away, Cherie put me at ease, and by the end of my session, I felt like she and I had been friends for years!  She is also extraordinarily talented and completely beautified me for my special evening ... not to mention the tan lasted close to a week, EVEN after I took a few hot pilates classes!  I will never go back to Versa tan, and Cherie is my girl when I feel the need to bronze up.  I highly recommend Foxy!

This coffee is amazing.  Two days in a row I have enjoyed the most delicious lattes I have ever had.  Chris and Aaron really know all things coffee!  As such, not only is their product fantastic, it's fun to learn from them while awaiting an exquisite drink.  So happy they're in my building. :)
