I have had about two employees that were helpful and nice here before. The problem is that I have had to come into this store MULTIPLE times because of the service or my phone acting up. My older phone I didn't get that worked up about because it wasn't a new phone and wasn't very expensive. BUT I had Sprint for 2 years and had an upgrade last November. The phone (Samsun Galaxy S III) was for promotion for $50 for Black Friday. So I decided that it was a good time to upgrade and would be saving a lot of money. For some reason the employee sold me the phone for $150 and said that I would get a $50 mail in rebate. But it still didn't make sense that I was still paying $50 more than what it was advertised. When I asked him about he didn't make much sense but I had waited in the store for about 2 hours so I bought the phone. I NEVER got the mail in rebate and when I contacted the store's manager he said there wasn't one for that phone (which I was obviously told by the employee) and did NOTHING about it. My bill had gone up because of fees and all this other stuff that was NEVER explained to me. So that had me frustrated. I contacted customer service (more than once) and have had trouble every single time. NO ONE will do anything about the problems I've had. Not to mention the service IS TERRIBLE. I don't get at minimum half of my incoming calls and the phone doesn't connect when I try making outgoing calls, even if I have service bars. 90% of my phone calls are dropped or lost, even when sitting in the same exact spot while on the phone. Text messages don't even come through sometimes for many hours and some I've seen sent to me on other people's phones didn't come through to me at all!! It's ridiculous. And I am aware that they're working on the towers and that is why the service has gotten even worse than it was before but they won't tell you that and they refuse to do anything for their customers because of it. The ONLY pro about Sprint is that they have an unlimited data package. I am so sick and tired of the service as well as customer service that I am going to be cancelling my service with them as soon as I can afford $300 to cancel it AND then start a new service with Verizon (who is GREAT- I had them before I went with Sprint). When I originally signed up for Sprint my bill was under $80 now they have somehow managed to creep it up to $109 for fees and charges I was NEVER told about when I purchased my new phone. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE. I would NEVER recommend someone to get this service. Pay the extra money for a service that actually works and that the customer service is good.... Which would be Verizon in my opinion. But ANYTHING has got to be better than Sprint!!!

I used to really like this restaurant and would go almost bi-weekly for their Ultimate Nachos. Girlfriends and I got together regularly specifically for the nachos and margaritas but the last few times I've went there I've been really unsatisfied. Service isn't that good, the margaritas are too pricey for the sizes and not to mention how little alcohol there is in them and the nachos have been disgusting and much smaller the last 3 or 4 times I've gone. I'm not sure if there's new management or what exactly the difference is resulting in the changes, but it's not somewhere I go anymore and I probably won't ever go back unless I hear good things from other people. Very disappointing.

The last visit I had here was fantastic!!! Our server was nice and paid close attention to what we wanted and was sure to refilling our beverages, he was even great about the coupon we had. I think he was probably one of the best server's I've ever had. I wish I could remember his name, but he was great!

This location is convenient for me but I can't stand having to come here. There is never anyone even trying to help. There have been multiple occassions where I've turned around saying "I need to ask somebody" and there would be an employee right there and they just walk away, don't ask what you need help finding or anything. And if you do ask, they are not specific. It's just not good customer service in my opinion. And they have very limited check out lines open when there are tons of customers. It's very frustrating. If they are that busy of a store they should hire more people to work on the registers because it's a real pain.

Everytime I come to this location I am very pleased with the service I get from the employees. They are always so nice and helpful and always know exactly where what I'm looking for is so it's a quick and easy trip for me. It is really great.

This is by far the best location I have ever been to!! I started shopping at Sephora because Ulta didn't carry what I had been recommended by a friend and because.... I just don't really like Ulta anymore... Every time I come here, I am helped to the fullest!! I have been matched, I have had the employees explain how the make up works and if they think it is a good choice to try. They give testers so you can try it before you decide to buy it (which Ulta has never done) and they are not stingy with returns like Ulta is. If you are not satisfied, they take it back. The customer service is always great, my experiences are always lovely when I come here. They make shopping for my beauty supplies much more enjoyable than it used to be!

This location is a good size restaurant and the food is really good. Although they're a bit on the pricier side the food is always fresh. The staff is usually always nice and smiling which is enjoyable. I go here for personal lunches and also do business lunches at this location.

Although this shopping center does have a bit of open spaces, leaving less stores in the plaza I really love the shops that ARE there. The Humane Society's Petique shop has animals for adoption and accessories for animals. They do special events pretty often. I've heard great things about the Dance and Karate Academies there. Elevate also participates in a lot of events and they have a great menu! I love going there before shopping around. The Bath and Body Works store is pretty big and they have a friendly staff, Amanda at the Salon and Spa is great! I will not go anywhere else for a hair cut. She's very nice and does exactly what you want with no restrictions! She will make whatever hair style you want, happen! Exquisite Swimwear (a boutique like shop) is great for all swimwear. They have regular bikinis to cup size swimwear, like I need since I'm a DD! They also carry cute children's and some men's. They have everything you could think of, their variety of accessories is great, from body chains, shaving cream, easy to use and cute bracelets, sunblock, very nice flip flops and more. I'm always pleased when I do my swimwear shopping here, the customer service is fantastic and the employees are very helpful and honest. If you're looking for a good quality bathing suit, I highly recommend this place.And the pricing is really good, there are bikini sets starting at $30 and they let you mix and match! And they always have new sales going on. They also gave me 10% off for liking the Facebook page. The Claire's always has a lot of deals and sales and the Yogurtini has so many good flavors, their staff is always very friendly as well! They regularly switch up a selection of the flavors which is fun because we get to try a lot of new ones! My kids love coming here for all of the events (all holidays and some random events), they have bounce houses, dj's playing music, contests to win free stuff, face painting and more. I really love this shopping center (and area), I really hope they get more stores because I think it could really start doing well and staying busy like it was before. There are a lot of options as far as restaurants go. There is a variety in what kind of food you are wanting to eat which I think is great. And there's even more across the street!

I have been very displeased with this location. There is barely any service when I've been in, I once waited with friends at a table for over 10 minutes to even be approached by our server. Once she finally came and we were thinking about what food to order she didn't come back to take that part of our order for over 10 minutes so we left. The food I've ordered (to go) has been horrible on two occassions. I'll never go back to this location, I've had about 5 bad experiences.

I am so upset this store is no longer here anymore, I absolutely loved it! It made my shopping for all the little boys in my life so easy! They had everything, the owner was so nice and we always chatted. He was really great and helpful. He was a great artist as well, I loved all of his prints (even the stuff that weren't comics)! I'm really hoping he opens up another store close by!!!

I really LOVE this place!!! Excellent customer service, they were easy going and joking around with us and giving us suggestions since it was our first time. And I will say that the White Chocolate Mocha is AMAZING!! I was very pleased which the beverage as well as service, I come back here every time I'm in the area. The seating was also different than Starbucks, which I liked. They have a fenced in area with chairs and tables and then some out front as well. I do recommend this place!

I saw this shop a few times while going through the mall but finally stopped in this past weekend. They had a bunch of merchandise on sale and the pricing was fantastic. There are regular bikini sets that are only $30 and there were hundreds of them. You can also mix and match them. They have cup size suits - one pieces, tankinis and bikinis (I'm a DD). Obviously cup size tops cost more but they all had underwire and a little bit of padding and there were all kinds of different prints and styles. It was really great. I bought 3 tops and 2 bottoms. And a few extra bottoms on the sale rack that were scrunch butt! They can make any bottom into a scrunch butt for only $10 and do other alterations. I am so impressed that I'm going to stop by their other location next week. The customer service was great, I was greeted and approached when the employee sensed I needed some help, she answered all of my questions and explained more information that I wasn't aware of. It was a very friendly atmosphere. They also have some jewelry and a ton of accessories. Although it's in the back of the shopping center and could be easily passed, it's a great store and I'll definitely be going back for my swimwear. Plus they're open year round which is helpful!

I know this is a new grill/bar but it is just not good... They don't have basics for a bar, service was not good and I waited about 15 minutes to even be approached by a server and they weren't even busy! Their deals aren't good and it is so small. I didn't even bother getting food and I'll never go back.

I was extremely impressed with Nicole and Tyler's help, genuine concern, fantastic customer service and urgency to get their job done efficiently for their customers; last weekend (2/15/15). Nicole was very nice and sweet. Tyler went ABOVE AND BEYOND for my friend and I in a very stressful situation. I have never experienced such helpful employees, ANYWHERE! I am more than appreciative of all the help offered to us, they were unbelievably awesome and handled our situation effortlessly. Everything was handled perfectly. I highly recommend this GoWireless and very highly recommend Tyler :)
