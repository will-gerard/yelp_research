We go to Sweet Tomatoes around once a month. It's very family friendly, as I have a 19-month old, and she seems to love eatting all the fresh veggies. It's a bonus that we do not have to pay for her yet.   Today was the first time I can remember going to Sweet Tomatoes without a coupon so we were a little surpirsed to be dropping $27 for soup, salad, and bread. Typically there is a coupon in the paper every week so take advantage of looking there first if you like to save a buck like I do.

We've been to many Indian food spots in the past but this is by far our favorite. The food is always on point and we are always greeted with a smile.

The price was nice, but I guess you get what you pay for. The food was ok, but it's probably not a place I'll venture to again.

This will be a popular destination of ours as the weather heats up. My daughter loves playing in the water rings at this place.

This is one of my new favorite spots. It's location may not be ideal but wow...was that food good! I had the BBQ fry bread sandwich and my wife had a traditional Indian Taco. The dessert was excellent as well and the staff was very friendly and helpful.

I had been wanting to try this place out and they happened to do a Groupon on 12-22-10, which I purchased. Sunday is one of my dinner nights so I went with my fiance and our 19 month old out to Tempe.    When we arrived they said there would be a short wait, which was not a problem. The hostest then informed us that they only have one high chair and it was in use. Bummer...we had to go elsewhere.

I decided to give this place a shot as I am a huge sushi fan and they advertised their sushi as half off. Most places do this at certain times and on specific days. Also, most places limit the half off label to "regular rolls." Currently, it appears as though this is an all day thing and applies to all of their sushi.   We went around 7:15pm and the place was not very packed. My fiance loved her meal (chicken and vegetables). The one downfall to my experience was the amount of time I had to wait for my food. My fiance's dish was brought out right away, but my sushi (rainbow roll, octopus, tiger roll) did not come out until she was half finished with hers.   The sushi and price were alright with me though so I'll be giving them a second chance.
