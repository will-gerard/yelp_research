Pointe in Tyme is so close to having great food but needs to elevate their side dishes and decor just a bit. They have a prime location at the Tapatio Cliff Hotel but they need just a touch of refinement to become one of their premier restaurants. Came in with a group of ten and the service was very good. Server was attentive and thorough. We ordered mac n cheese, calimari, and ahi tuna. Adding crab or lobster to mac n cheese would make more sense than chicken macaroni and cheese as it doesn't seem sufficient as an appetizer for a group. I had the flat iron steak with chimichurri. It was delicious! I would definitely recommend it but potato skins were straight out of a chain restaurant. Again, so close, needs a taste elevation.

What a lovely place to spend shopping and browsing. Great layout and helpful staff. Their selections are unique and well made. As a teacher, I am always looking for something to make my life easier and for attention holding products for my classroom. It is the must visit teacher supply stop. My children even love going there because they have games and activities on display for little hands and expanding minds. Be sure to check out the coupons because there are some great deals!

Came in today with my seven person family. I love Bahama Bucks and was excited to bring in my visiting East Coast family. I go often to the Chandler location and think Jeff Shaw is a great business owner.   In my order of seven, my young daughter's order got mixed up and it ended up being blue raspberry and red raspberry instead of sour blue raspberry and sour red raspberry. No big deal and I have been working on my daughter's confidence anyway so I sent her up to just explain the mix up and get the correct order. The employee said that she didn't say sour and he would not fix it unless she paid. She came back to the table nervous and said they wouldn't fix it. I went up and asked if they could help. They said I could buy a fixed cup at 1/2 the price and I asked to speak to the manager, Ryan Cooper. He reiterated the 1/2 price offer. I told him my daughter had said sour and he said that his employer said she didn't and he believes him. I walked back to the table and let my daughter it wasn't going to work out. I am not sure why I had the incident I had today because I think the guarantee of losing my business is way more costly than the one small cup. So disappointing and embarrassing to the family with me.

Yay! I'm a fan perfectly describes how I feel about Liberty Market. I am a fan on weekdays when it is not completely packed and a 45 minute line. Yay for outdoor seating in the heart of downtown Gilbert. Hooray for the employees of LIberty Market who ask you where you would like to sit and hold your table so you have a place to go after the line. Three cheers for the garlic smash, flatbread pizza, chicken Caesar salad, and lemon/raspberry bar. Super cute cocktails in a bottle and very tempting dessert to go options. Delicious food and great vibe but they have to figure out a way to decrease the wait time to get to it!

Definitely a bar for the younger, straight out of the college dorm, not safe to leave your drink unattended, head bartender offering free drinks for lifting up your shirt kind of place. Thumbs down. The place was full but the whole experience left much to be desired. They did have some cool games outside like giant Jenga and Connect 4. There was an electrical chair inside for funny photo ops.

As an East Coast transplant, I have been on a search for authentic Italian and imported goods from Italy. Score! Defalco's Italian Grocery is a cafe with salads, pizza, sandwiches (hot and cold), pasta, and soups that are made to order. They have a delicious pastry cold case with lemon bars, cannolis, and various Italian desserts. Biscottis are made fresh daily and so is their mozzarella. The seating is limited so it's not the best place for group meet ups but there is more room on the back patio.   After travelling throughout Italy, there are certain staple products that I love and, hooray, they are here. Whether it be cheeses, meats, packaged pasta, canned tomatoes, almond syrup etc, you're sure to come across some great finds. It's a small store - it actually looks like it could be in Italy with their use of all available space - but definitely worth a trip.   Imported beer and beverages available too!

The best espresso drinks I have had in Arizona. Wifi, benches, a healthy menu, and friendly service make this place my favorite java destination. I offset my iced mocha with Greek salad. If you're a panini fan, try the Ciao Down. Although, I may ask them not to toast it in the future. Located in Scottsdale with indoor and outdoor seating; they cater to professionals getting together for the casual meeting while making my 4 year old feel just as welcome. He was entertained last week watching them roast their beans in house. Come in and check it out. Don't forget to take a look at the art on the wall done by local painters and photographers and find out while closing the bathroom door is optional.

Absolutely delicious Thai for an extremely reasonable price. Located off the strip in a run down strip mall, this foodie heaven is definitely worth the walk but be sure to get reservations because it opens at 11:30 and by 11:45 it is at max capacity.

Service was absolutely wonderful. My husband and I were well taken care of by a group of three waiters servicing our table. The food was out of this world. I have spent time eating my way through Italy and, if I closed my eyes, couldn't have told you if I was in Rome or Las Vegas, Florence or The Wynn. Even the olive oil tasted fresh off the press.

I'm not sure what I love more - the food or the ambiance. Jean Phillipe is such a fun place to visit just to look around; they even boast the world's largest chocolate fountain. My favorite thing to eat is the banana foster crepe.    Trying to find seating in the cafe is nearly impossible so just grab your food, make a left and grab a seat near the window overlooking the pool area.

My husband and I love to take the family to Maggiano's when we're in Las Vegas.  The food is amazing but be sure to bring your appetite!  It's family style so it's obviously huge but the portions here seem to be exceptionally large - even for family style. The stuffed mushroom appetizer, the caesar salads and the linguine/clams in red sauce are my recommendations. The service at this restaurant is amazing, as well. My drink was never  empty, they timed each course perfectly so that I was never with too little or too much food at my table and my leftovers were whisked away and returned in cute little brown packages before I had time to even notice they were gone.  Great experience!  The restaurant is, also, on a great part of the strip so you can walk off all the food you just ate while taking in the sights.

What a fantastic place for a girl's night out! The food is delicious and the atmosphere is both lively and private. On weekends they have a DJ.  Their appetizer and small plates selections make for a perfect tapas experience. As far as entrees, the scallops with polenta are amazing. Check out the hummus and bacon wrap dates for appetizers. Looking forward to another fun night at Olive and Ivy!

Great selection and great prices. I especially find their shoe department to be the place to find bargains. Too names in clothing and they hold up very well. I have had no problems returning any item and love the Nordstrom debit card option. That rewards check is a lovely mailbox surprise! Clean dressing rooms and store but bathrooms are not kept up with..

What a great experience for my family and I!   Not only was the food delicious but the service was fantastic! Caitlynn made sure that our drinks were always topped off and we were never in need of anything.   I could have probably hung around all day chowing down on the light and warm tortilla chips, homemade bean dip, and fresh salsa. The guacomole was not overly seasoned and made to order. The chunks of avocado made for a healthy and yummy dish - and at $3.99, it's a steal!  White the shrimp fajitas were tasty, I would suggest giving the fajitas a healthy overhaul. A little too much oil and harshly chopped veggies don't do much for the presentation.   Kids meals were a great serving size, coloring contest kept them entertained, and they didn't even bat an eye when I wheeled in my large stroller with a sleeping toddler. The game was playing at the bar and the bartender made sure to give us a nice, friendly greeting as soon as we came in the door.   Will definitely be visiting Garcia's again!

I have to say, anything less than 5 stars for the Kate Spade in Fashion Square is just nuts. Not only are the products spectacular but the customer service is next level. They have always been so sweet and so kind but, I have to admit, I was kind of a pain on my last purchase. I had fallen in love with a bag while at the Kate Spade in Oahu and forgotten any kind of information on the style. I remembered the price wrong and even the color. I was a hot mess. They never once acted anything but happy to help me get the right bag in my hands - even being will to overnight ship it to me for free. I ended up finding a picture of it in my iphotos and emailed it to them. They wouldn't hear an apology and were just happy that I was happy. They made my 11 year old feel welcome to browse around the boutique and, after falling in love with their inventory herself, she will be getting her first Kate Spade this Christmas. Thank you so much for keeping the joy in such a fun label.  Of course, the store is fantastic. This past week I was greeted by flamingos on leashes. Does it get better than that?

What an excellent experience I had with Discount Tires today! Thank you, Joe, for your amazing customer service and quality work. The staff here was kind, accommodating, and efficient. I was back up and on the road within an hour. I will absolutely be returning and having all tire work and new tire purchases done through Discount Tires.

I love the Coffee Shop. It is atmosphere mixed with food mixed with efficiency perfection.  Yes, there will always be a line but it's a Gilbert line so you're 7 people deep and thinking, "Oh my gosh, this is insane! I'm practically out the door!" but just hold up and hang in. It is worth it. The coffee drinks are great - iced mocha is my jam. Breakfast dishes are delicious. I recommend the Veggie Scramble. If you're feeling a sweet is necessary then definitely do not skip the cupcakes. Amazing! So, so good. Also, really cool people stop in....like probably everyone you know. I can never leave there without seeing a friend or friend of a friend. It's a good place to be!

I have seen LOVE four times now. I an't get enough. I am so in love with this show. I don't know how it could possibly be better. What amazes me is that the cast seems to as thrilled to be performing the show as I am to watching it. Fantastic performers, fantastic costumes, and absolutely unbelievable set design.

Fine dining Mexican! Love the pomegranate mojitos and the complimentary warm, fire roasted salsa. Highly recommends the fish tacos with cilantro-lime rice and black bean dip as side dishes.   Very friendly towards kids with a big kid and small kid menu.

Not sure what all the hype is about. My food was okay but nothing that I'd go back for. A little pricey and the service wasn't anything to rave about either, unfortunately. No refills on the salsa and chips or drinks. Was with a party of five and we all were bummed that we couldn't back the high ratings Mariscos Sinaloa had received in the past.

Food was delicious; the silver noodles were my favorite. The service was spotty, at best. Three young girls running a very busy Saturday night shift was not ideal. Long waits, lukewarm dishes, and you can forget about drink refills.   Keep the menu, hire more help.

What a great family experience! Fantastic sushi at a reasonable price. We ordered the Hot Arizona, Spicy Tuna Spicy, Crunchy California, and the Red Dragon. They came out in good time and presentation. The highlight of our visit was the treatment our three year old son received. Our server finished my sentence as I asked for juice being watered down for him, brought his food out first and on a child's plate complete with snowman characters on it, and dessert on the house. He was treated extra sweetly and as a welcomed patron. Thanks so much for making him feel so special!

Best products, best customer service. They're happy to see you and they're happy to help. I have no concerns purchasing from Apple because they completely stand behind their products - even though, in my case, it's always user error.   A standout in customer service for me is Gabby. Excellent find Apple Store. She represents the quality of your products with the quality of her attitude and care.

In and out in 10 minutes with new title, registration, and plates. Painless. Not many smiles but the lack of small talk keeps the process moving. I definitely recommend over the Department of Motor Vehicle. Only downside is that you cannot get your drivers license here.

I needed to schedule a last minute appointment on a Saturday. After calling numerous offices with no luck, Agave was able to get us in with no problems. They were extremely friendly and visiting their office was a great experience.  Most impressive, for me, is their eyewear selection. High end eye glasses and sunglasses. Fendi, Tom Ford, Ray Ban, Lacoste, Marc Jacobs, Gucci, Kate Spade, and more. I will absolutely be recommending this office as the go to place for eyewear selection.

What a wonderful group of kind and generous people. This organization truly does make it their mission to serve the people of this community through the Open Arms program, their Mercy Ministries, and all the youth programs. My family has been truly blessed to be a part of such an active church and especially engaging children's, junior high, and senior high youth group.

Sprouts is fantastic. Sprouts is full of healthy, high quality foods and their produce selection is top notch. It's Whole Foods without emptying the whole wallet. Each week there are special savings offers but on Wednesday they apply the week ending with the week beginning for double the savings. The vitamin selection is wonderful, as well. I pick up all my supplements, vitamins, and proteins when there. Just added a new raw foods selection.   All this pales in comparison to their customer service. I love this store and love how well they take care of me. Thanks Sprouts!

This is a great option for a family meal out. It is not East Coast pizza which was a bit of a bummer but they do have thin crust Chicago pizza which is pretty similar and, if you're a deep dish fan, you're in luck. The portions here are HUGE! Everything is supersized. It's impressive. The drinks are as tall as my forearm; no refills needed! We ordered the chicken wings - good size and the regular buffalo is a good choice. I highly recommend the brussel sprout appetizer. They were yummy! I thought the decor was fantastic. It was old time-y complete with I Love Lucy re-runs running.   You can eat in or eat out. Good for kids and groups. The bar is pretty tiny, though.

After meeting Tyler, I felt very confident that his company would do a great job on our Arizona yard. My family and I are new to the area and wanted to hire a professional to care for our lawn. After Tyler handled the first couple appointments, a younger assistant started handling my property by himself. He sprayed our front ground covering with pesticides that caused the plant to begin to die. One could see exactly where the spray occurred and then the brown starting to emerge from that spot as the poison spread throughout the covering. He did this on our center island and on the entire covering on the right side of the house.   I contacted Tyler to let him know what happened and he felt it would recover. The center island looked so bad because the entire covering had died, was beginning to grow mold underneath and was not as large as the right side so I decided to just take it out and cover the area with rocks and a new cactus. I sent Tyler pictures and asked that we not be charged for that month's services as our one ground covering had completely died and the right side was on its way. He agreed and, once again, said that if I left it alone, it would come back. I decided to leave the right side alone and give it a chance. There were still a few green buds so maybe? It didn't and I need to rip the entire right side up.   Tyler contacted me saying that I still owed him $55 of the $110 of the months payment. I told him that we had agreed not to charge me that month as his assistant killed a significant amount of my landscaping. I sent pictures and he refused to budge. I reminded him that I am going to have to buy more plants, more rocks, and tear it all up. He still responded with   "....please pay for the one service that is owed to our company. Thank you, Tyler Foutz President"  My husband and I decided to just give him his money and walk away. It's not worth arguing over $55 but I am disappointed that there was never even an apology. Somehow, pesticides killing lawn is my fault. Oh well. Enclosing before and after pictures.

We had a lovely time walking through these outlets. The stores that are here are all very nice and a great selection for adults but there are not enough stores for children and tweens. I had no problem finding places for me to find clothes and walking around in the beautiful Arizona backdrop is a cherry on top. I would really love it if they would invest in the market for the kiddos. My 11 year old daughter loves to shop but the stores she was looking for weren't there. My 3 year old can always be bribed to stay in his stroller with the promise of a toy store but no toy stores either.   Also, there were some nice choices for drop in, to go food but it would be awesome to have a a couple restaurant options for a nice, sit down lunch or dinner.

New dentist in town and she is just AMAZING. Only arrived about a month ago and took over for Dr. Chauhan. I have been struggling with dental issues my whole life and she took an X-ray of my face, identified the root of the issue, and now I'm on the road to a long term solution and not short term (and expensive) Bandaids. Not only is she brilliant but super sweet. I'm even going to move my kids from their pediatric dentist over to here.

Quickly becoming one of my favorite joints in downtown Gilbert! Joyride has great food with a great vibe. Trio of tacos is a fantastic deal with diner's choice of ten different tacos. My favorite three are shrimp, fish, and braised beef and, since the side dish comes with, the back beans. I suggest eating at the bar. The bartenders make it a fun experience with their service and making sure the right games are on. In the booth, it's perfect for get togethers! Side note - the old school early 90's hip hop that happened to be playing was the cherry on top. On a final note, to the owner of Joyride, your manager is absolutely fantastic. He is epitome of the Joyride customer experience and his staff follows his lead. My server accidentally forgot my dish and he made sure to come by, apologize, thank me for my understanding and ask what dessert he could bring the table to make up for it. The pudding. The answer is always, "The pudding."

Came on a Saturday afternoon with my family of five. We were seated right away (as the place was empty) and given a trio of salsa. Pace yourself because any refills are a charge. Kids meals came out quickly. Corn dog and chicken strips were fine but my daughter's beef taco was not edible. Not only was the meat completely void of taste but the shell was stale. We got chicken nachos for the table. Not sure what the other food tasted like because the combo of oil, dried out chicken, and canned chilies, my stomach hurt too bad to eat anything else. My husband did seem pleased with his carne asada grill entree.   The restaurant layout was fine and the waiter was nice but I would not return.

Stopped in at Moreno's Mexican on Sunday to pick up some appetizers for our crew. After talking to the manager, Jesus, and hearing the backstory of how Moreno's came to be known for their Sonoran Style hot dogs after humble beginnings as a foodie stop at the local tire shop, I just had to try them. Absolutely delicious! I don't know how they do it but it is bursts of flavor on a Mexican bun. A true Mexican bun, as well. They are imported from Nogales. I was a big fan of their mild (chunky) salsa, bean dip, and queso. The hot was a little too hot for me but my company enjoyed it. The queso had a little kick to it, as well, but just the right amount and it seems tempered by the spinach that is mixed in - plus, you just might fool yourself into thinking it's a tad healthy. Just kidding!   I will definitely be stopping by again. There is a surprisingly full menu. I heard rave reviews about the Chicken Fajita Burro and the Pollo Fundido. The service was quick, the atmosphere was friendly, they have happy hour specials with Margarita specials between 3-6 pm. There is outdoor seating or you can watch the games on the tv inside. Catering is available, as well.

I love this store so much. It is a breath of fresh air. I love their selection of bibles and devotions. They have beautiful home decor and framed pictures. The $5 deal table is great and I am always impressed with what they're offering. It has the best selection of Christian music - modern, worship, old school, rock, and rap - then any store I have found in the Valley. One request would be that they expand their book section. More books on Spiritual Warfare from authors like Bill Johnson, Graham Cooke, and Leif Hetland.

Kneaders and I have a love/hate relationship. Their desserts are fantastic. So delicious and so bad for me. Their Key Lime tart and Raspberry pie are unbelievable but you just can't go wrong here. They include one of their amazing chocolate chip cookies with all the meals and you can try out other desserts in their sample section located next to the cashier. Nice espresso drink options. Their iced mocha is pretty good. Also, all the fresh brewed ice teas are delicious. Green tea is 100% healthy - no additives and no sweeteners.   You can order online, they have a drive through, and can cater. I can't tell them how much business they get of mine just because I can feed my family without getting everyone out of the car. Kids meal bundles are loaded - sandwiches or soups, drink options, fruit, cookies, and a toy.   If you're looking for a cute present for a girlfriend - this is definitely a place to check out. Surprised? I was too. Jewelry, house goods, aprons, and they will wrap it for you too.   The reason they aren't 5 stars for me is that I can fatten up easily here but I can't slim down. Even their veggie sandwich has mayo on it. Only healthy breakfast option is oatmeal but you have to request no sugar ,just berries. Even their salads come with bacon or ranch or sour cream based dressings. Yes, I could pick things off and request no croutons or rolls or bread but it would be nice if I could receive the full entree I paid for without having to pay for things I don't want.

This review can easily go to five stars ; the Hawaiian shaved ice served here is great - when you get it. Eventually. After a very, very, very long wait.   Went it with one other person on a Saturday night. There were about 7 families in front of me. 45 minute wait. The teenagers running the show are so, so incredibly slow. Their personal conversations are so loud that I can tell you exactly who is going to ask whom to the next dance and why they hate their dad. My very nice date night took a downward turn after my husband was fed up with standing nearly an hour watching the process and we had babysitter's at home to get back to.   I thought it may have been a freak occurance so I came back on a Monday around 1 pm. It was completely empty save my party of 5 and another family of 3....35 minutes later, I was finally able to get my shaved ice.   I have tried the drive through and that was more timely so that is a good option but I don't want to the dyes being spilled all over my car so it's not a long term solution.   My kids love it and it is a bummer because we pass it three days a week but I am way too busy to wait nearly an hour for a cup of ice with flavoring. I met the owner and he is a really nice guy but I can't imagine how many people are patient enough to keep returning.  Update: Was contacted by the owner of this Bahama Bucks. He was very concerned that my guest and I had a bad experience and was determined to make it right. Was open to any suggestions and was very refreshing to speak with. I was sent a few coupons and dropped in today to use them. Ordered three snowcones and was on my way in six minutes. Nice job guys!

A hidden oasis in a busting town. Giada's is a wonderful place to get away from it all. Peaceful and serene with delicious food everywhere! Handmade pasta, pesto, appetizer options to keep you coming back, and authentic Italian entrees. I could go on about the delicious food but I'm sure the other reviews will cover that. The must not miss are the lemon ricotta cookies. Oh my goodness, they are AMAZING. Eat them, take them to go, bring them as gifts, try not to eat those too.

Five stars is not enough for this amazing crew. The way they sprinted back to the truck after dropping off their load was just incredible. Their work ethic blew me away and they couldn't have been nicer.  Don't even hesitate to call these guys. Affordable and absolute prime service!   Thank you guys for knocking it out of the park!

Stopped in at Cunningham Salon Organic on a whim and walked out very, very pleased. I was so impressed with the quality of products that were available and level of service offered. The owners are new in town and they just opened in August. The salon has a clean, minimalist but soothing ambiance. Very clean and very friendly. Shampoo, hair mask, cut, dry, and style all for $45 make this the new must-try salon in town. I had the pleasure of having Megan cut my hair and look forward to having her tame the do in the future. Thanks so much, Megan! Love the work!

The potato smash, oh, Tetas smashed. So delicious! Had a chance to grab a bite here while in Vegas. Bar seating makes for quick and easy service. The staff is fantastic and the portions are huge. I mean huge! I got the breakfast sandwich and I probably would not get that again. A little too big, a little too greasy, and a little too rich. The lady next to me had French toast with berries and she seemed very pleased. It was definitely a pretty dish. The hot chocolate is a must. They don't skimp on whipped cream!

I highy recommend the Border Grill for any of your three meals in Vegas. I have to specifically single out Randy and thank him for making our experience so wonderful. He was an absolutely amazing server who took our time at The Border Grill to the next level. My husband played Menu Roulette and Randy nailed it with Chicken Poblano Enchiladas. Oh my goodness, DELICIOUS! Nice choice! My parents ordered the Carne Asada tacos and the tortilla soup. They were very happy. I had the Grilled Fish tacos and they were great! I will definitely be eating here again and definitely be ordering the Poblano Enchiladas.

What a wonderful surprise! Absolutely delicious goodies ready on the spot. They were friendly and the bakery was very clean.   We bought a good selection to see how our favorites stacked up:  - Loaf of Whole Wheat and Honey bread - Chocolate Babka - Lemon Bar - Toffee Bar - Orange Roll  The chocolate babka was soft, perfect amount of chocolate, not sickeningly sweet. Pretty perfect. My Jewish mother couldn't see how to improve on it at all.  I was a big fan of the bars. The lemon bar was delicious and my favorite. Fresh lemon - nothing aritifical here! Confectioner sugar dusting on top. The toffee bar had so many layers of flavor. One bite was all I needed. The orange roll was perfectly undercooked. Soft and sweet but could use a little more orange frosting.   Delicious afternoon! I will absolutely be going back.

I had visitors in town and we decided to give this new pizza joint a try. We came in at 1 pm. The dining area had only two other guests. We ordered at 1:10 and received two gluten free pizzas at 2:02. It was anything but enjoyable trying to have a nice conversation with my guests while our 4 year olds were getting hungrier by the moment. I can eat gluten so just ordered two individual slices which they handed me straight away but they sat there for 52 minutes while I waited for the rest of the tables food to arrive. There was no apology or explanation. I asked about 30 minutes into it if the food would be coming out soon but she said she would check and never came back.  It would have been some consollation if the gluten free pizza didn't resememble cardboard with toppings. I was embarrassed and felt bad that they left hungry.

I had a chance to stop in for lunch today at PloyThai and walked out very satisfied. The service was friendly and very attentive. We started out with the Miso which, while a little salty, was chock full of carrots, celery, onions, and chard. This will definitely be my go to the next time I'm feeling under the weather. The egg roll appetizers were crispy and delicious. In addition to the normal vegetables, there were tiny silver noodles inside giving it a nice texture. We ordered Pad Woon Sen, Chicken Chow Mein, and Orange Chicken for the table. The first two dishes were great. I especially loved the Pad Woon Sen. Noodles were cooked perfectly, fresh vegetables, and the flavor combinations on the Pad Woon Sen and Chicken Chow Mein were spot on - the plates were emptied quickly. I probably wouldn't order the Orange Chicken again. It didn't taste very fresh. My daughter insisted it was made with Kool-Aid but I think there was just a little too much orange marmalade.   All in all, a very nice experience. The restaurant is decorated very nicely. Clean and open space. Television inside and a big center table to accomodate group functions. They have a lunch menu and extended dinner one, as well. I, also, must thank them for being so sweet to my children. All the cups had the bendy straws, there was scrumptious coconut ice cream to end the meal and even my three year old, who wasn't in the best of moods, was smiling and asking more noodles once he tasted the chow mein.   Thanks so much!

My husband and I were so excited to try out Babbo's new Queen Creek location. The location is prime being right off Queen Creek Road and the interior is very nice. It has a clean and modern feel. There is a fully stocked bar and booths for groups. I got a pomegranate mojito and it was very good. They even have Peroni on tap! The service was excellent - extremely friendly and extremely quick.   The incredibly quick service was nice but I would request they slow down and make some changes to their recipes. It may take a little bit longer but the time it takes to dice up some fresh tomatoes vs. throwing cold canned tomatoes on bread could be the difference between a repeat customer and disappointed visitor.   Appetizer of Bruschetta Combo. We ordered the Pesto Fresh Mozzarella, Chopped Pomodoro, and Roma Tomatoes. Nice crusty bread but canned mushy tomatoes with very little seasoning. I think the chef must have forgotten to drain the can because my bread was saturated - inedible. Even the mozzarella slices were hard vs soft. Bummer because it sounded really good on the menu.   Main Course: Pomodoro Tomato Pasta and Pasta Rustico. I hate writing this because they really were very, very nice but the Pomodoro Tomato had no sauce, the same canned tomatoes, not nearly enough salt or seasoning and was absolutely drenched in oil. I was able to drain the oil out and take some of the extra sauce from my Pasta Rustico to make it somewhat okay. My husband was getting really hungry by this point so I was ready to be creative. The Pasta Rustico was good. They described it as "Lasagna in a bowl." and they were right. Full of sauce, cheese, spinach, and penne pasta. I was able to fill my belly and have some left over to bring home.   Unfortunately, I would only go back if I heard there was a revamp of the old recipes and a new chef. The manager, Ryan, could not have been more accommodating and friendly. If this review were based on his customer service - 5 stars, hands down. However, the food has got to improve so that this restaurant can be all that the staff and the beautiful ambiance have set it up to be.

Many thanks to the Thirsty Lion Gastropub & Grill for extending a free meal to the Yelp Eliters. My friend and I had the opportunity to visit their new Scottsdale Fashion Square location on Friday. The staff could not have been kinder or more accommodating. We enjoyed the beautiful day eating our lunch on their outdoor patio. I was impressed with their variety of appetizer and entree options. There are plenty of classic "grease in your gut" pub platters but they also have healthier selections if you're interested in keeping the caloric content down. We ordered the Grilled Fresh Artichoke and Shrimp Ceviche to start our meal off. The artichoke had a good taste - little chewy - but the crispy onion strings and aioli had great flavor. The shrimp ceviche was fresh, light, and had a little kick with just the right amount of lime. I will admit that it was tough to find the shrimp in the dish - tiny diced pieces vs good sized chunks. Next up was our main entrees - Cubano sandwich and the Black Bean and Quinoa Veggie Burger. My friend was able to perfectly sum up the Cubano, "Excellent. Mustard and pickles made it; they're the key elements of a Cuban and they nailed it." The focaccia was crunchy on the outside and warm in the middle. My black bean burger was delicious. Red quinoa and black beans made it visually appealing while the burger was moist and chocked full of deliciousness. Great job pairing toppings because the avocado, smoked mozzarella, and sun dried tomato pesto were perfect accents to the burger.   It was a good meal and we walked away completely stuffed. Great ambiance and wait staff. TVs and outdoor seating along with spacious interiors make it a good option for group meet ups. Free parking right outside the doors. I would recommend that they extend their non-alcoholic drink options. Fresh brewed herbal teas and fresh lemonades would make a great option if you're not a big fan of soda, Minute Maid, or Lipton.

The main reason that I choose a pediatrics office is for the doctor. Being new to the area and having a sick child, I was anxious to find a kind doctor who took him time with patients and parents. After seeing Dr. Jacks, I am happy to say that I have found the pediatrician for my kids.  Going with four stars because Dr. Jacks is wonderful but the office needs work and care. New books for the individual patient rooms is a must, as well. Both my four year old and twelve year old we're counting ceiling tiles while we waited. There are separate sick and well sections and a movie was playing but I think it waiting dolma should put a child at ease and make him/her forget where they are at and the possibility that needles could be on the horizon.   Puts some effort into the little things and I think this practice has a bright future.

While the prices are a little crazy, I love this place! My favorite drink is a Cloud 9 with 1/2 honey boba and 1/2 passion fruit poppers. I probably don't want to know how much sugar it has but I don't care, it's delicious!

Another delicious joint to use an excuse to visit Old Town Gilbert. Joining some amazing eateries, Pomo is making its mark in stone oven pizzas. The menu has an abundant list of options to make your pie hit the right note for you. Visited last night with some friends and had a great experience. The seating was quick, the service was attentive, and the food was delicious. Impressed with their fresh bruschetta and starter options. All pasta is fresh and handmade. Salads and soups are also entree choices. They have several Italian beers on top along with a wine and cocktail list. Their fresh brewed peach tea was delicious. Our table ordered two pies - margherita and a prosciutto/artichoke/mushroom/olive one. They both were eaten up quickly and the crust was spot on. I ordered a Kale Romana salad with grilled shrimp. Very good, a little dry. Kale needs dressing help always. My husband had the pasta. He and I were both surprised how much he liked it. He comes from an Italian family and has a wife that makes her own pasta and gravy so he will sniff out the frauds. He loved it and would absolutely go back.

Popped in to grab a quick bite with my husband. Happy hour starts at 3pm - even on weekends. They have an excellent menu with delicious options.  - Spicy garlic edamame is amazing! - Seaweed salad is light and tasty - Atkins roll is yellowtail, salmon, crab, tuna, and avocado wrapped in cucumber. Delicious! - Spicy tuna roll is very good, as well.   While the man running the show was busy, he made sure we were taken care of. What a great experience! We will most certainly be back.

Decided to check out the new Thai place in Gilbert. Located right by Agritopia, Talew Thai has limited spacing but uses it wisely with a second floor and patio providing additional seating. Would not recommend for large group if you're planning on eating in but thoroughly enjoyed visiting with my daughter tonight. She had the chicken dumplings and I had the Pad Woon Sen. Both were delicious but the latter was just a little too salty and too slimy. I will admit that I am a pad woon sen snob, though, so I'm bumping up the original 3 star to 4 stars. Portions were generous and the service was excellent. Thai tea was great and free with a Yelp check in. I will definitely be returning to try more items on the menu.

So grateful that the Yelp email let me know about this place. My husband, four year old son, and I dropped in yesterday for lunch. The outside decor doesn't draw you in ("Smile You're on Camera") but the food will jell you coming back. We shared the Vegetable Lo Mein, Mongolian Beef, and Szechuan noodles. They were all delicious! There is no children's menu so we had leftovers for the little guy but we still got out of there only spending $39 - my husband had some beer. Full service bar, excellent customer service, fun entertainment, and fantastic food. Welcome to the East Valley, Singing Panda!
