My dad loves coming to BJ's restaurant when he visits from Michigan. Today I decided to try something new, garlic Parmesan wings... And I am very happy I did. They were delicious and I got 10 of them! My father had the mahi mahi and was very pleased with it as well. I love that no matter what I eat, it's always amazing!

By far the best breakfast I have ever had. I am normally not a breakfast person, but I will wake up early for their chocolate chip pancakes. I brought my father here today and he enjoyed the chicken fried steak and eggs with biscuits and gravy and he said it was the best breakfast he has ever had! The food here is amazing! I love coming here!!

Huge fan of Sweet Tomatoes! I come here whenever I get a coupon in my email! This week they have amazing berry salads and dessert! The strawberry shortcake was delicious!

Came to Gordon for some yummy pizza and beer. I enjoyed myself greatly. Our food and drinks came out quickly. My friend and I had a wonderful server who was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. She was helpful with assisting us with our beer choices. I will come back again.

I love coming to Hillside Spot! They have delicious food and it's a great environment. I tend to get the tuna salad sandwich every time, but why mess with something so good? I defiantly recommend it or their salads! It's a great place to eat at!!

Walked over to Buffalo Wild Wings due to the craziness of trying to get to Mill on the 4th and was super disappointed!! We sat down and there was only a couple other tables and quickly ordered a beer; however we never got it! Our server never came back to give us our beers even though they were sitting there for about 8 minutes to get picked up. After watching him walk over to them multiple times and him not bring us our drinks, we had to leave. Super disappointed!

I love coming to Coach & Willies! They have great food and I like coming in for drinks. They usually have a bunch of games on and will change the channel if you need them too. Good place to come!

So I went into Graz 15 minutes before they were closing and the people working there were nothing but kind and willing to talk to me about their menu. It's my first time and they took the time to go over the menu and help me make some accommodations to my sandwich that I wanted. The food is great and the people are kind. It's definitely a place to go.
