Heaven on earth. This place has it all: good burritos, awesome salsa, cold beer, creepy mexican carnival music, and an I (heart) Huckabees Poster in the women's restroom.

I like Modified. The art is usually alright and the venues can be pretty awesome.  One thing I don't like is how sweaty it gets. It usually smells of Bed Head products and burnt hair because of the little hipster kids. Not a fan of that sent so much.  Modified usually has some good indie bands playing, however Bright Eyes has yet to play there. Aww shucks.

They denied me a job and are assholes. I don't like anyone who works there. I own a few things from there, but I have to admit they are very over priced for the type of stuff they sell. They need to get off their high horse.

I love Macs. Fuck PCs (even though I own one). The employees are a bit off-center, but when they actually come up to you and think you're hot, they're nice. Happened to me the other day. True story.

The only thing I don't like is the "IM BETTTA THAN U" attitude of some people, but other than that, it's amazing. It saved my life, no joke.

The Rose is the best. Lack of IDing, yet lack of under agers. Shitty art and ripped up wavy velvet couches. I like the architecture.

I love Delux's vegetable pannini (sp?) sandwich. Superb. The sweet potato fries that come in a little shopping cart are quite aesthetically pleasing. The parking lot sucks a lot, since it is near the Biltmore and everyone who drives at and near the Biltmore are morons. Except me, of course. They're a bit pricey but if you're a rich homosexual, that shouldn't be a problem.

Ikea is heaven. Everything is amazingly chic and cheap. I don't like that there is only one of these havens in Arizona. I think tucson deserves one. I am going on wed. with John A. We will go for three frames but come out with a lot more.

I would give it zero stars. I work there and their company and management is full of shit. Fuck Macy's.

I really like RetLab, but the prices keep me at a distance. For example, I went in to look and I found the perfect sketchbook. Adorable and fun, with a little pizzaz, you know? I was about ready to buy it when I turned it around and looked at the price. "12.99?" I asked myself. "With 8.1 or something % sales tax?" "No way." So I put it down and went to Borders and bought a normal one for 4.27 with tax.
