I've been researching salons in Central Phoenix for a couple of weeks.  I figured I might have to check out a couple of salons before I found the one that offered a great cut without breaking the bank....I lucked out on the first try!  Not only did I love my cut but I was warmly greeted and offered a refreshment  (a glass of wine)...who can beat that! :)  My stylist was Eric T.  I went in on Saturday afternoon to freshen up my long straight hair with some bangs.  Eric listened to what I was looking for and started off cutting them a little longer so that I could play with them over the weekend and see if I wanted to go shorter.  Previously when I had bangs cut, the stylist would cut them too short...so they'd finally start to look like what I wanted 1-2 weeks later.  At The Root, they offer free bang trims (AWESOME) so he was able to squeeze me in on Monday for a quick trim up!  I LOVE them!    Not only am I happy with my new bangs, but I sent my hubby in the next day and he came out looking SHARP!  Before he'd go to the barber shop where he'd come home with a buzz cut.  Eric took his time, styled his hair and he looked like a million bucks....without braking the bank!  We're very happy with The Root (and Eric) and will be visiting again very soon!

The BEST sushi in Phoenix! They're not trying to be arrogant, they just serve quality food.  They have a wonderful selection of the most fresh fish!  I also love that it's BYOB.  So they focus 100% on the food.  And they have a great selection of none sushi items to cover everyone's palate.  Plus the service is phenomenal!  My personal fav is the Rainbow Carpaccio!

Tailwinds is the 1st pet resort for our pups, Murphy & Jane.  We've taken them in for grooming there, but never an overnight stay. My husband and I were out of town for 5 nights and we were worried sick.  I just picked them up and they were happy to see me...but they looked like they were having a 'puppy party' at Tailwinds!  The employees knew our pups by name and were so sweet with our dogs.  Murph & Janers came out with BIG smiles, trimmed nails and clean coats.  They looked better coming out then they did going in!  I would highly recommend Tailwinds to friends/family and we will only use Tailwinds from here on out!
