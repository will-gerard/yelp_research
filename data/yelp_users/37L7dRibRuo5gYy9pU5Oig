I've stopped in here periodically over the last several years and see a recurring theme.   On my last visit I wait 20 minutes for two sandwiches. I tried to be patient, thinking that all the customers coming through the door had placed phone orders. Finally had to ask where my food was...the guy who took my order either lost it or tossed it. They took it again and I waited another 10 mins for them to fix it. When it was finally ready I didn't even get a discount, a free drink or comp'd meal...not even a "we're sorry".  Not terribly surprised.   Four stars for the food, 1 star for service, 1 star for cleanliness....averages out to 2 stars.

The food was good but not worth the premium. We had a very attentive waitress that we felt did a great job but the manager or owner apparently didn't agree. He was very rude to her through out the entire time we were there...it was obvious he was talking down to her. He no sooner yelled at her for something then walked into the food pick up area and dropped a handful of napkins on the heavy foot traffic area. Most people would throw them in a dirty bin but he picked them up and put them back in the clean pile. We were lucky enough to watch him do that from our seat. I might have gone back based on our initial experience but after witnessing the manager or owners behavior toward his staff we won't be back.  Too bad, I love the idea of a locally owned business being successful.

Wish I had read the reviews before eating here. The host that met me for my take out order was very nice and the food was ready quickly as promised but it was very bland and a little strange. My wife ordered the Garlic Chicken, while it appeared to be cooked it was very odd in appearance, like a unnatural white so she ended up not eating it. I ordered the Wok Fried Chicken which was tough and far heavier on fried then chicken but in this case that was probably a good thing. Thinking the fried rice would be the safe option we ended up having to remove all the chicken from the rice before we were comfortable eating it. Unfortunately it won't be on my list for a return it. I would give it one star but will give it two for friendly staff and quick service but for no other reason.

I've read some of the reviews and am not surprised at some of the harsh comments, the truth is they are well deserved. We've been hear twice, the first time during their first month of being open which offered slow chaotic service, bland food and staff that seemed really put out to be helping us. After this experience we knew we didn't want to go back.   Fast forward to the day before Thanksgiving 2013, after a busy afternoon and a taste for Mexican we agreed that surely after all this time they've gotten over their opening problems. Nope! Still just as bland, chaotic and full of staff that seemed unhappy to have to serve us.   When they first opened we were excited to have a full service Mexican restaurant nearby, now as we drive by it daily it's a sore reminder of what could have been. We find ourselves missing Longhorns Steakhouse that used to be there.

Love it! We live about 9 miles from here but still make the drive. The salads are very fresh and high quality. It may seem a little high in price after adding protein (chicken, steak, prawns etc) but it really isn't; you could make two meals out of if you wanted to. Just have them do the dressing on the side (with an extra) rather then toss it in and it will keep long enough to have the next day. My wife and I wish they would open one south of the San Tan 202 to save a 30 min round trip drive.

Great mattress. I went to the downtown Phoenix office to check one out as I was a little hesitant buying a bed online. I didn't have an appointment but they quickly accommodated me and showed me to an area to check one out. Honestly, I only needed a few minutes to realize it was a done deal. I ended up buying two. One for me and one for my daughter. The guy walked us to a mac in the office area where we paid then he took us down to the warehouse and grabbed our boxes. Both fit easily in the back seat of my vehicle when stacked. Got home, opened the box, unwrapped the tape around it and it laid itself flat. I opened the packaging and it inflated within seconds. I think I read that it could take up to two hours to fully expand but both that I purchased seemed to be fully inflated in less than a minute.   I've been on it for close to a week at this point and while the first night was comfortable, each night gets better and better. There is also very little to no movement felt when getting on/off.   They offer a 100 night sleep trial in which time you can return it and they'll donate it to a charitable group....sorry charitable group we'll keep ours and I'll likely buy one for my son when he complains about how much better his sister's bed is than his.  Check 'em out....very comfortable mattress, solidly manufactured and great price!
