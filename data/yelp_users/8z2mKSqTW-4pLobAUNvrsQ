Came here for a Fashion/Art Show. Amazed by the prompt service even while crowded!  Happy Hour is a must! $3 beers and $4 appetizers. Not a huge selection but awesome eats nonetheless!  Cheese fries were ooey gooey and had a generous amount of cheeses! Yes, I said cheeses!!  Chicken Strips are thinly coated and very moist. 4 large strips of pure goodness!  Meatballs! 3 large meatballs full of flavor, smothered in marinara sauce and cheese with 4 pieces of garlic bread!! These will please your mouth in ways its never been pleased!

Good food. Friendly service. Cant wait to go back! There is a place in PHX that has spicy Mexican food!! WOOHOO!!!   The waiter was new and you could tell...actually, there was a few new waiters. I read that they do have a revolving door here. Honestly, who cares as long as I get good service and good food at a great price!   Chips and 2 types of salsa when I sat down. The bean and cheese dip is YUMMY! my chimicanga was YUMMY! My drinks were always filled and the waiter didnt overly bug us!  This may just be my favorite Mexican food!!!

We went on a half price Saturday.  In short ... lesson learned!  Packed store! Finding help is impossible. When I did get some help, the lady was not interested in listening to me or answering my question. Store isn't very organized.

Slow service.2 hours after filling out paperwork, paying co-pay and explaining whats wrong to the front desk, finally got seen by the nurse who said you need to go the emergency room and the front desk should have told you. Then we had wait for a refund and go wait another 3 hours.  NEVER AGAIN WOULD I COME HERE!

Not impressed by the food.  Atmosphere is crowded. Maybe they will be on Restaurant Hoarders.  Waiter was a jerk. I asked for another and got one but she was dumber than a box of rocks (i didnt mean to insult rocks)  Too expensive to deal with waiters with attitude and mediocre food!

As soon as we sat down the waiter said "im off in 10 minutes, i cant wait" wow, there is a way to start a meal!  food is bland. had to grab a waiter for refills. my waiter would come over, sigh very loud and ask if needed anything else.   wont come back because the food and service sucked!

I guess since im not a native from Arizona I dont see the big whoop in Cerreta Candy.  They have some chocolates, they some caramels, they have some nuts.   We did the tour through the factory and it was nothing special. The first 20 people in line got to actually learn about the candy. The rest of us got to walk by it and if we attempted to stop and look were told "OK! Let's move on people" nice!   I would say the best tasting was the caramel.

HUGE selection of pastries, affordable and one to fill every appetite!!!! My suggestion: DANISH COOKIES!!!!!!!!!!  Staff seems annoyed when you ask questions and they are not personable at all.   Everything is freshly made and you get a sugar high just walking in the place. They have a generous selection of sugar free items as well. Don't forget to look in the refrigerators to the left, there is ALWAYS plenty of pies and cakes to take home for a special occasion!!!

FUN! FUN! FUN!  This staff knows their stuff! They were able to answer any and all questions thrown at them. They make the art of pizza FUN! My daughter loved being able to pick her own toppings and see how it would look. The gentleman making her pizza was making her laugh and having it look fun.   The owner walked around and made sure everyone was pleased with their creation.   VERY FUN atmosphere! Amazing staff! Fantastic owner! Great food!

Clean. I love this chain for their $1 coupons and gas rewards.  Staff is rude at this location. Every time I ask a question they just stare at me like a deer in headlights. So if I'm only going in and out and not needing to ask anything this is my store of choice.  Oh Yeah ..  The cashier had a hickey on her neck for goodness sake!

I hate buffets! But this is beyond a buffet!!!! They make food fresh, so its never just sitting around. Steak and seafood cooked in front of you. Staff constantly walking around so no kid has the option to even attempt touching items with their fingers.   Staff is friendly. Restaurant is clean. Great selection of food!

Decent prices. Large portions. fresh food.   Egg drop soup was a mix of egg drop, Chicken and Miso. Nothing fantastic about it but not horrible. Orange chicken was great, not too spicy and not too sweet. Broccoli beef was evenly proportioned with both ingredients. Cashew Chicken was ok.

Shrimp cocktail is a must! Spicy with a hint of sweet! Excellent service. The price is a little high until you see the portions. Spicy salsa with chips is served after you order your drinks. Great margaritas and friendly staff.

Friendly staff. Clean and fresh food. Fast service. Decent prices! Gyoza was my favorite and a meal since it included a salad.  Orange chicken was a bit sweet but just ask for hot sauce on the side.  Drinks were filled before they became fully empty. We will be visiting again VERY soon!

Let me start this by saying, Every single sushi restaurant I have been to in Phoenix SUCKS! The rice doesnt stick, the rolls fall apart and they are BLAND! My Suggestion: Cherry Blossom Roll & Sweet Thang!  Our waitress was VERY helpful! She told us her favorites and any house specials immediatly! We ordered and watched our rolls being made on the T.V. behind the chef's. My daughter got a kick out of that!!   It is a small establishment but it does allow the owner to be more in tuned with the customers. He walks arounds, greets all customers and even takes orders if the place is busy. He learned it was our first time and made sure we were pleased with EVERYTHING! We also got to try the Fried Cheesecake with Chocolate Sauce...talk about Super YUMMY!  Amazing food!  Amazing Service!  Inexpensive!

Purchased a Groupon for this visit and we definitely got our monies worth.  Service was excellent! The manager stopped by our table a few times to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. Food was delicious and came out in a timely manner.  Hummas was smooth and the pita bread was hot and puffy! Beef schwarma was incredible!!  We bought Baklava and another dessert to go. The other dessert has 4 cheese layers and a sweet syrup on top. Very good but burnt on the top.  Only 4 stars because there was no belly dancing as stated on their website. Manager and waitress could not explain why either.  We will be coming back and hopefully get to experience the belly dancing.

There is a Mexican restaurant connected to the bowling alley. clean and spacious seating, game room and bathroom. Great mix of music and great selection of bowling balls.   I can't wait to go again since I do have a Groupon for this place again.

I haven't been to Sears in YEARS or so it seems. I would say mostly for the older crowd. Lots of racks on sale. Store smells stuffy and like mildew almost.  I had to ask for help in the jewelry department even though I stood there and made eye contact with the staff not just 1 person and Nope, not even 2 but 3 employees.  Service is lame.  Store layout is confusing since there are not a lot of signs telling you where everything is.

Fast. Easy.  Staff is so so. The JJ's in Wisconsin are awesome!!! No other state can come near to their pep!  The cashier was leaning on the counter and would just say "yeah. Ok. What else?"  Subs were made fast.  Store needed some love from all the crumbs piled everywhere and over flowing trash.

Great service.  Flavorful food.   My Lover had the meatball sub. Hearty portion of meat and the garlic/parm fries were amazing!  I enjoyed the cheese ravioli in a Marsala Alfredo sauce. Very very good!   Ended the visit with a cannoli. They make them in house. Very light and whipped perfectly.    I can't wait to go back. They seem to have great specials throughout the week.

Worst. Service. Ever. Thought it'd be a fun family dinner... not. Sat with my family of 3 for 20 minutes before getting our beverage cups. Another 20 minutes was spent waiting for food. 40 minute wait for food MAY be acceptable when busy. We were the first party to order,  4 other parties came in after. 3 parties were served before we decided to leave and actually get service elsewhere. Maybe we ordered a lot? Not at all, we ordered 2 rolls and rice. Sad day.

I dont even like the fact that I had to give them 1 star. To make a long story short.   1. buy car. 2. they agree to fix things on car but need to order parts should be done in a week.  3. week comes and goes and another and another and another all while i am making calls asking where everything is. i constantly get the "we will have it shortly" 4. FINALLY after a month and a half, i take the car in and guess what...THEY DONT HAVE THE RIGHT PARTS!!!!  5. get fed up speak to GM, yup the big guy 6. he works out a great deal, i take loaner car for a week while they work on car and they will have it delivered to my house (BTW: I live an hour and a half away) 7. get car after a week and, there are added scratches, bumper looks same as before and paint job looks like it was done with nailpolish!   Staff sucks. I had someone walk away from me as I was talking to them. I had another call saying I need to go pick up car since I didnt want to trade in the car I originally bought. And another  tell me I was being ridiculous when I asked to speak to their manager.
