This place never disappoints!  With a mix of Italian and Asian cuisine there are always lots of choices.  My boyfriend and I couldn't decide so we chose one Italian dish and one Asian dish: Seafood Yakisoba and Cajun Shrimp.  They definitely did not skimp on the seafood!  Both dishes had plenty of shrimp!  I love the warm bread they serve prior to bringing out your meals as well.  CherryBlossom also always has a great assortment of desserts.  This time we had the peach cheesecake which was amazing, and highly recommended. I feel like a lot of small restaurants have slow service, but that is not the case here!  Great food and great service make this a place I will definitely be visiting again!

Everything here was amazing!  I can't think of anything that I was unhappy with, which is why I'm giving this place 5 stars.  I made a reservation for my boyfriend as a surprise birthday dinner last week.  I was a little hesitant planning a birthday dinner at a new restaurant.  What if we didn't like the food or the service was poor?  When we walked in we were immediately greeted by a guy who I'm pretty sure is the owner.  After checking out the menu and FINALLY deciding on a dish (everything sounded great), my boyfriend ordered the seafood risotto and I ordered the rigatoni primavera, a vegetarian dish.  Each dish was served with a salad or soup and they also served fresh bread at every table.  While we were waiting for our food we noticed that the crowd there was much older.  I think we brought the median age down by about 30 years!  I also noticed that the guy who seated us was visiting every table, and chatting with everyone.  It seems like most of the people who were eating there were regulars, and knew all the details about this guys family.  Our salads arrived, and although the portion was small the Italian dressing was delish!  Next came our main dishes.  My boyfriend's plate was packed full of seafood including shrimp, scallops, mussels, and clams.  A bit too fishy for me, but he loved it.  My dish was amazing as well, with lots of flavor and tons of vegetables, including mushrooms, zucchini, and cauliflower.  In past reviews I always mention how it can be difficult to find vegetarian dishes with lots of flavor unless you are at a vegetarian restaurant.  That was not the case here at all, this place delivered.  The portions were big, so my boyfriend and I both ended up with some to take home.  We were both disappointed in knowing we had dinner plans the following night, as we were looking forward to eating our leftovers!  This restaurant was a nice change of pace from our usual loud and crowded old town restaurants.  The place was nice and quiet, with some light music playing in the background.  Overall, it was a great experience, and   I will definitely eat here again.

This place was AMAZING!!  It was my first time here. I took my mom and sister along with me for manis and pedis.  Knowing it was a Saturday afternoon (and it might get busy) I made an appointment ahead of time.  They greeted me by name when I walked in.  We had only planned to have pedis done, but when we saw what a great job and a great price they had (the special was $16 for a pedi or $26 for mani/pedi, it's usually $18 or $28) we all asked for manis as well.  Despite another group of three coming in during the middle of our pedicures, they did not rush through our appointment at all.  They took their time.  Their basic pedicure also included hot stones (most other places charge extra for this).  I was extremely pleased with this place, and highly recommend it!

Another great pedicure from Vs Nails.  I was a little disappointed that my sister was seated quite some time after my Mom and I, but for the most part all of our pedicures were started around the same time.  I wish this place was closer to me.  I would be there more often.  I did feel a little jipped on the massage portion, but can't complain too much with such a great price.  A $16 dollar pedicure that includes hot stones can't be beat.

I recently visited Los Reyes de la Torta.  This was my second visit, which was definitely disappointing compared to the first.  The aguas here are DELISH!! They make a great summer drink, especially in this AZ heat.  I had the agua de sandia (watermelon), and my boyfriend tried the agua de fresa (strawberry) cremosa.  For the cremosa drinks they mix it with Carnation and sweet cream, and I have to say this is one of the thickest ones I've had before.  We ordered the queso fundido with jalapenos which I was really looking forward to.  However, this was a huge disappointment.  The waitress placed the plate down and I noticed that they served it with tortillas rather than tortilla chips.  I grabbed a piece of the tortilla, and went to scoop up some gooey queso fundido...except it wasn't gooey.  It was a gelatinous, almost solid bowl of cheese.  This didn't seem right to me.  We asked the waitress to warm it up some more, but it came back the same.  After asking her about it, she said they don't serve your traditional queso fundido.  They use mozzarella cheese which doesn't really melt to well...For dinner I had an order of the coctel de camaron (shrimp cocktail).  They are very generous with the shrimp.  Actually that's all that was really in there.  I would have preferred a little more avocado and  to have some cucumber in there was well.  I wouldn't mind giving this place another shot, especially for their awesome aguas.

This place actually deserves ZERO stars, but Yelp makes me give them at least one.  I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED SO HORRIBLY IN MY LIFE!!! THIS PLACE HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!  I don't usually type in all caps like the above sentences, but that was all I could do to express how horrible the customer service was.  My boyfriend and I went in for some pizza.  I will say it was about 1:30 am on a Friday night.  I say this because I see others have mentioned how poorly they were treated late night as well.  We asked for 3 slices of cheese pizza with jalapenos. There were only 2 pieces of cheese left (everything else had meat =(...) so we quickly ordered a veggie for our 3rd slice since the lady at the register was very quickly getting irritated and impatient..  Literally right after paying we walked to the side to wait and turned back and saw a fresh cheese pizza that had come out from the back.  We quickly asked the lady at the register if we could change the veggie we had ordered for a slice of cheese.  She refused to exchange one slice of cheese pizza.  Another employee who was boxing the pizza up for us tried to change out the slices for us, and she yelled at him for trying to do so.  In my past experiences if a customer asks for a pizza that isn't out on the counter, they would go and check how much longer until it was ready.  This was not the case here.  I could understand if there was some long line out the door, but since it was before 2 am we were the only ones in there at the time.  I cannot express how poorly we were treated.  I will never go here again.  I would rather deal with the long lines at Joe's than the horrible customer service here even if there was no wait.

BEST PLACE EVER!!! This is the best happy hour I have ever been to!  I try to go at least a couple of times a month.  Half price drinks and carafes of sake, rolls, and appetizers.   The chicken gyoza is amazing, and I always get two orders for myself.  It comes with a chipotle aioli, but I always add a little Sriracha.  Their specialty rolls are delicious, and they have the most creative names like Dragonball and Bye Bye Kitty.  The sake flavors are always changing.  Some of my favorites have been pumpkin (seasonal), spicy mango, pineapple, and pomegranate.  Another fantastic draw for me to this place is that their happy hour is 7 days a week and is a nice 4 hours long.  Some places do a lame 2 hour happy hour and your rushing to get there, and make it on time.  I can't say enough good things about this place.

A-Maiz-Ing!  I have so many friends who do lunch here, and have been wanting to try this place for quite some time.  I had some Scottsdale friends who were venturing to this side of the 51, and one of them suggested grabbing brunch here.  We went in mid-morning on a Saturday and were seated immediately.  As I glanced around, I noticed many of the people appeared to have finished eating already and were just hanging out and enjoying drinks.  $3 dollar mimosas and bloody marys with a meal is an awesome deal, and a great way to enjoy your brunch.  After reading through the menu for quite some time I was having a tough choice deciding between breakfast and lunch.  This is in fact one of the tough decisions to be made when having brunch.  Breakfast?  Lunch?  Both?  I finally decided to go with lunch and ordered the Uptown Caprice with a side of french fries, and of course a mimosa!  We ordered a plate of the Spinach Arty Dip served with both chips and pita bread for the table which didn't disappoint.  The pepper jack gave this dip a nice kick of flavor.  As my growling stomach watched all the delicious plates come out from the kitchen, I anxiously awaited the arrival of my sandwich.  This was one of the best sandwiches!  The spinach added a different flavor I haven't previously encountered in other caprese sandwiches.  And the balsamic was divine!  My only regret is ordering french fries instead of sweet potato fries.  It was all I could do to keep my hands to myself, and not grab  some off of my friends plate!  Needless to say I will be back here soon to further debate with myself the infamous question of breakfast or lunch!  French toast...I've got my eye on you!

I have been a fan of America's ever since I was introduced to it over a year ago.  I tend to eat vegetarian dishes most of the time, and can definitely say I've had my fair share of non-meat dishes with no flavor.   The beans here are amazing (and lard free!), as is the guacamole.  The Trio is a great starter which includes chips, salsa, and guacamole. For the vegetarians the bean burrito (I add guac to it with a roasted jalapeno on the side), is quite tasty.  The menu item I look forward to the most (and sometimes go just for this item) is the America's corn.  Don't let the ingredients scare you away, just try it.  It's DELICIOUS!.  Sweet corn covered in mayo, cotija cheese, chili, and lime.  My boyfriend frowned at it the first few times I ate it in front of him, but once he gave it a chance he was hooked.  I crave these all the time! I do have one complaint about America's, and that is the horchata.  The horchata had good flavor, but is REALLY grainy.  I think it would be a lot better if it was strained.  This has lead me to no longer order horchata from here which is unfortunate because it makes a great accompaniment to their main dishes.         I have been to all three of their locations and each has an awesome patio great for enjoying a beer or margarita on a warm Phoenix day!

Sens has a great flavor.  I have been there a few times now, and always leave planning my next trip back.  Last night was my most recent visit which once again did not disappoint.  If you enjoy a little bit of heat their sizzling shrimp dish (which is not on the menu) delivers with a kick!  Full of onions, spices, and great flavor I order this dish with a side of jasmine rice.  This was my first time trying the spicy wontons which were also very tasty.  The best part of this dish was the dipping sauce that came with it.  The sauce has a drizzle of wasabi on top, so if you don't like the nostril burn it causes give it a good stir!  The pineapple ginger tofu comes with a delicious ginger dipping sauce, and is a great option for vegetarians.  Just a tip...if you order any of the tofu dishes BE SURE to poke holes in the tofu to let the steam escape.  This was the second time I burned myself when I bit into it. Sens also delivers great flavor in their drinks.  Last night I had the "Lust" martini which is a citron vodka and cranberry.  They aren't cheap with the booze either, always a plus when spending $10 dollars on a drink.  The strawberry basil martini has always been popular with my friends and I as well. Lastly, for dessert we had an order of the sweet wontons filled with both goat and cream cheese and drizzled with a peach puree sauce.  The flavor combinations is amazing.  The portion size is disappointing.  It's literally 2 tiny bite size wontons.  Great for a taste, but if you have a definite sweet tooth this dish may not take care of it entirely.   I highly recommend Sens, especially with a small group which will allow for trying more dishes and flavors!

This was the worst pedicure I have EVERhad!!  I will say that I went in at a semi-busy time of day without an appointment. Needless to say, this was the quickest pedicure I have ever had.  When I looked at my nails to check if they were dry I noticed two of the nails had bubbles and the paint extended beyond my nail bed.  The lady who had done the pedi had already started on another customer, and had to leave them to come back and fix my nails.  My friend was also having a pedi done and said that there were still rough spots on her heels.  I will never go back to this place again.

I had my first experience at The Lounge last night.  I have to say the drinks were AWESOME!  A few of us dropped in after the Home Tour.  My boyfriend and I just gave the bartender our taste/flavor preferences and Chris the bartender did more than deliver!  I had been wanting to try the Whip Cream flavored vodka for quite some time and Chris mixed me up an orange-creamsicle tasting drink with it.  My boyfriend had the Tokyo Tea which uses Midori alongside traditional Long Island ingredients. It's great to find a nice lounge without having to drive too far from home.  The service was awesome, very friendly and personal.  This is a great place to take a few friends and just enjoy some good drinks and good company.  I can't wait to go back and try the food and more of the delicious drinks from Chris.

Just got my nails done yesterday with Tricia.  I LOVE my nails!  As I waited for her to set up for me I checked out the full set she had just completed.  A Halloween look, it had a glitter background with stars and moons carefully placed into the acrylic.  It seems Tricia can create anything you can dream up.  Onto my nails...I had originally scheduled a full set of white tips.  After Tricia checked out my nails, she opted to not place tips and just put acrylic over my naturally strong and curved nails.  I had heard of this option before, but it was never mentioned to me as a better alternative to tips at the usual high volume, "get me in and out in under an hour" shops I go to every now and then.  Tricia hand sculpted each nail perfectly.  She then recommended throwing a little glitter in the acrylic to give it some shine.  I was a little hesitant at first.  I liked the idea, but didn't want to much bling.  She adjusted the powder for me to give just the right amount of glitter to complete the simple look I wanted.  As I was paying I also checked out Brandi's (the owner) nails which had lace pressed into the acrylic.  Very cool!  Kashmir takes their time to create each look, and from what I've seen can complete anything you can imagine!  I also appreciated that Tricia decided not to do tips and grind half my nail off in the process!
