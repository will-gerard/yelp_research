I absolutely love going to see Dr. Carr and his wonderful staff. Dr. Carr is a perfectionist and I always know I'm in good hands. Beverly and Nancy worked very hard to help me out with an insurance issue and they resolved it seamlessly. I've never been happier with a dentist.

Prenatal Peek is awesome! We went last Saturday and the baby had his hand over his face the whole session so they rescheduled us for later in the week at no additional charge. Great customer service!

Shaggy's is one of a kind! I love getting pampered and I had the best experience here. Julie is amazing at what she does and I absolutely love my new cut and color! Their prices are great and I love the atmosphere. The nail tech does great work too!

Love this place. Their pizza is good and their service is great. The owner personally shakes his customer's hands and seems to know many of them by name. Awesome place and experience.

The reason this office gets one star is they have some really great doctors (so I hear) and some or at least one that is not so great (unluckily, I chose her), but the problem is, is that once you chose a doctor, even if you haven't seen them before, you cannot change doctors. In my mind, this is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. I would never go back to see the doctor I saw. She was very cold, uninviting, no personality, etc. So they would rather lose my business altogether than to allow me to switch to one of their better doctors that can actually communicate and relate to their patients. That's just bad business sense.

This place exceeded my expectations! The food was amazing and our waitress was outstanding! It was our one year anniversary and she brought us each a glass of campaign (on the house), as well as the amazing caramel apple pudding. The experience was awesome!

If you are looking for sun screens, CC Sun Screens is the best in the valley. They have the best prices and they do great work. I had another company quote me $1,400 to replace the screens on my old frames, but CC charged me the same price for new everything.

I cannot explain the love I have for this coffee shop. They take their coffee so seriously and have great pride in what they do. The thing I love most about Peixoto is the integrity in the quality of service and coffee. They don't serve anything with artificial sweeteners or corn syrup in it. Everything is just true in nature there. They also support local farmers by using locally made half and half, milk, etc. They make every cup of coffee fresh. It never just sits there warming for hours. They even grind the beans right in front of you. There are not a lot of businesses out there that have such pride and dignity. These guys make coffee an art, a craftsmanship. Love. Love. Love.
