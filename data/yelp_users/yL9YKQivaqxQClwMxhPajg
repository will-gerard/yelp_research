Let me preface this review with the fact that I'm Chinese and I know my rice.  So after a meeting next door @ Hava Jave (review for that place to follow) a friend and I wandered over to Zen32 for a 10pm snack.  Boy was that a mistake.  I normally eat up at Celsius in Desert Ridge so I thought I'd get the same food down here to compare.    A couple of the rolls we ordered:  Viva Vegas Roll Caterpillar Roll  The service was just fine but honestly, even if I had Angelina Jolie serving the food naked, the food would still be crap and the rating would still be an UNO star.  The rice seemed like it was day-old rice.  It was clumpy and honestly, I don't know how a sushi chef  takes CLUMPY rice and puts it into a roll...  so anyway, due to the clumpiness of the rice, the Vegas roll was loosly rolled so it fell apart when I tried to pick it up.  The Caterpillar roll tasted super bland which is VERY hard to do because it includes so many different ingredients like eel, faux crab, avocado, cucumber, and eel sauce.  Not only did it taste bland, it was also poorly rolled.    Again, the service was nice but you might want to bring your own sushi if you're going to eat here...

It's 2005 and I was referred to my normal dentist to Reed for some extra teeth that were under my gum line.  Nothing really affected me but Reed suggested that he remove 3 wisdom teeth and 2 extra teeth below my gum line on my right lower side of my jaw.  So a total of 5 teeth.  Little did I know he was going to CUT AWAY my gum line and expose the roots of my existing teeth that were FINE.   He claimed it would be fine and the gums would grow back, they never did. The exposed sections of the roots caused infection in my gums and I lost a molar and am probably going to lose another one this year.    I haven't been able to chew solid food on the right side of my mouth for the past 9 years.  ridiculous.   I'm currently looking for an oral surgeon to hopefully rectify this HACK JOB that Reed left me with nearly 9 years ago.  Every day of my life I regret going to Reed and after showing the results to my regular dentist, he stopped referring patients to Reed.  Even the desk attendants were pushy about the surgery saying I should have them all removed in one session vs having them done in two sessions.  Clearly this office is money hungry and they don't care about the patient's well being post surgery.

In summary, don't go here.  I checked out this place on a whim and it was the mistake of the weekend.  I picked up the curry combo plate because I was hoping to try the different types of food they have.  The fried rice was simply rice with soy sauce and maybe somewhat fried?  The noodles they had were pretty bland.  The curry was really bland and watery.

Active Life Center was recommended to me by a friend who also works in the medical field when I complained of chronic back pain that I had been experiencing for several months.    Tom was super friendly and welcoming to help me out and fortunately had an x-ray machine because it helped him diagnose my condition.  After a couple of months of weekly visits and instructed exercises that I could do on my own at home, I felt much better and even bought some of the same equipment that they use in the office for my home.  I'm very happy I met Tom and his team at Active Life Center.  Without a doubt, I would send my friends and family to Tom and his team.  Thanks Tom!

Whenever I crave Chinese food, which is often because I AM Chinese, I hop in my car and drive 27.1 miles down to this place for several reasons.  1) It's authentic. 2) It tastes reliably great every time I go. 3) There isn't another Chinese place on the north side of town that serves anything comparably good.  I know the young college kid/busboy/waiter that Madi D. mentioned and yeah, there are times when he's a little space brained but it's not intentional and for the most part, he's pretty attentive to customers.  So yeah, the service may not be a 5 but once you get to know the people working there, they take care of you.  While I agree that it shouldn't matter because a patron is a patron but still - this is just how it is...   My favorite dishes from this place include:  * Eggplant and garlic sauce * Beef stew * Porridge * Salty fish & chicken fried rice * Four season beans * Beef noodles * Bitter melon  It's all very tasty and believe me, I wouldn't drive over 50 miles round trip several times a week just so I could yelp about it later.  I've brought many friends and family here and will continue to do so in the future because it's just that damn good.  If you see me there, feel free to introduce yourself, you can tell if I'm there because my oil dripping car will be in the parking lot (read my review for Right Toyota!).  Cheers!  c

Going off the single reviewer here, I thought it would be nice to check out this place and see if really was ALL THAT...  No, it wasn't.   As the other reviewer noted, the interior isn't fancy but that's fine because in Thailand many of the dining establishments just have a few pictures of their king and queen on the wall and that's it. I was just in Thailand earlier this month and thought this would be a pleasant place to eat to remind me of the great food I had there. Sadly, I was disappointed.  The food was bland, the chicken overcooked, and the "pad Thai" noodles didn't taste anything like normal pad Thai noodles that I tried in Thailand or here. In fact, they tasted like Chinese pan fried fat noodles. I don't have anything against Chinese pan fried fat noodles but if I wanted that, I would have gone elsewhere.  There are too many other Thai places to try in Mesa/Gilbert to waste your time/money here.  Especially when they close at 8:30pm and charge you an extra 92 cents for an extra bowl of rice. If the owner of the restaurant reads this,  take note - rice isn't a huge cost when measuring on a per customer basis and you're already charging the customer a premium for the bland curry you're serving so follow suit with other Asian restaurants and just offer more rice instead of nickel and diming your customers.

I wouldn't even come here if I were DEAD!  While every family will need a mortuary service at one time or another, I would not suggest coming here because the experience will be somewhat mixed for the grieving family.  Yeah, you get a bunch of information about what they can do for you, what you can do, when you can say your goodbyes, etc... but man oh man, the experience is pretty much like the negotiation room at a car dealership.  Richard Giffe, who works with the customers is very informational but trust me, it's downhill from there.  He was ridiculously insensitive when asking questions about the deceased and talked really loud AT us, not to us.    I unfortunately have had to meet Richard more than once.  At my uncle's funeral last year, he stood at the podium and said "I don't speak Chinese but I do know sweet and sour pork".  WTF?!  If you unfortunately need a mortuary, skip this place...  Don't believe me? Check out this article in the Arizona Republic.  http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2008/05/18/20080518priceofdeath0511.html#comments

I stopped by @  Diamond's Sports Grill aka Sluggo's Sports Grill to try out a new place with friends and ordered a sourdough burger with fries.   Well...  I just google image searched "sourdough burger" and yep - what I had last night did not look like ANYTHING on the first 18 results.    I know, sounds ridiculous but hey, I just wanted to double check because what I ate last night was ridiculously greasy to the point that the bread was soaked, the bread was barely toasted, the shape of the bread was entirely different to the shape of the burger and it brought back memories of eating short hot dogs with long hot dog buns back in the day when I was in college.  I appreciated the pleasant memories from college but now that I'm 31, I'd like to have food that's a bit better in quality.  The fries were unremarkable.  So food aside, I was paying the bill and the server did the one thing I absolutely abhor when I go out to eat.  For a $15.xx bill, I gave her a $20 and she asked me if I needed change.  Now ok.  I'm not going to be living in the streets over $4.xx but at the same time, I find it very annoying when someone asks for a 30% tip when the service was poor.  Don't go unless every place, and I really mean EVERY PLACE IN THE AREA THAT SELLS ANYTHING EDIBLE, is closed or you love curt service and bad food.  To be fair, the place wasn't all bad news bears, I got to meet up with my friends!  :)

I was craving Korean food and Chodang, which is further south on Arizona Ave, was closed.  We were shown a table quickly and throughout the night, the service kept the cups of water filled and anything we needed, they took care of (more on that later).    I picked up the Jae Yook Bokkeum which is a spicy stir fry with pork and vegetables served with chilled noodles.  Holy cow was it tasty!  I've tried this same dish at the Takamatsu in Glendale and it wasn't nearly as good (check out my other review to see how bad it was).  The chilled noodles that came with the dish helped offset the mild spice of the dish and my girlfriend who doesn't normally like spicy food ate 2 small bowls of this dish so she clearly liked it.  The sushi was nice as well the gf picked up a roll or two and that was all gone by the end of the night, I don't know of too many sushi places in Chandler so if you want sushi, swing by.  All together, the food was only 30 something bucks and after we left our waitress came running out.  Duh, I had forgotten my wallet on the table.  :) Great service!

10 years ago, this place changed my life!!!  I attended ASU and graduated back in 2000.  During my senior year some of my Chinese friends and I (I'm Chinese too) decided to go eat pho @ Khai Hoan.  Up until then, I lived my life pho-less and oriented my dining experiences around a majority of the chain restaurants that are littered around the Phoenix.  I say "litter" because a majority of them really are rubbish...  I'll cover those in other Yelp review(s).  So we head over and I first notice that Khai Hoan doesn't have much street appeal and to be honest, before they revamped their interior within this past year, it wasn't that great looking on the inside either...   But I quickly found out, that doesn't matter ONE BIT.  This place rocks.  I'm no stranger to soup and initially thought this was a variation of a ramen soup meal but I was so wrong.  The broth packed an amount of flavor that would seem impossible to cram into a liquid that was so thin.  The meat was soft and I found myself inhaling the noodles and broth to make up for the nearly 20 years of NEVER HAVING PHO...     Since then, I've been making up for that injustice.  I've been having pho nearly once a week or sometimes even more often than that and have been going on a spree to convert my friends to being pho-fans.    :-)

Don't get me wrong, for the ASU community, it serves pho that will suffice and pass for pho but if you have a car and can go elsewhere, go elsewhere.  Don't get this place mixed up with the OTHER Pho Nhat located on Southern and Dobson across the street from MCC.  That other place is AWESOME.  THIS  place is all about mis-hits and complete misses.  I've come here and have had pho which is ok and other times when the broth is so laden with salt and msg that I feel suicidal 4 hours later.  I really hate giving out 2 stars to an establishment but the pho I tried here recently really made me feel ill hours after I ate it and I would be doing all my fellow Yelpers a disservice if I didn't say anything.    The good: clean establishment, close to ASU, huge playful Disney characters painted on the wall that reference BBQ even though it's a pho house, lots of parking, tall ceiling and you don't feel claustrophobic inside.  The bad: somewhat salty/msg laden broth, small basil leaves.  There aren't many "bads" but that broth was so bad it almost had me sawing away at my wrists with anything that was sharp.  I felt bloated yet dehydrated at the same time.  My eyes were super dry, the joints in my hands swollen, my mouth parched...  this place unfortunately deserves the 2 star rating of "Meh, I've experienced better."  I almost gave it a one star rating but I've had stuff in the past that was decent so it gets another star.  If you're feeling lucky, go check it out.  If you have the best pho of your life, try to extend that luck and buy a lottery ticket.

This place is as legit as it comes...  I live in North Phoenix near Desert Ridge and I often go down to Mesa to eat at Best Hong Kong on Southern and Dobson.  Now, I hardly go there not because I don't like the food but because I can get another dish with the gas money I save by going to King Wah!   If you're a fan of bitter melon, ask for a special dish made of bitter melon, beef, and egg.  It's a legit HK dish that not too many restaurants make but King Wah will do it for ya.  :)

Chino Bandido has the best food you never thought you'd ever enjoy.    I ordered the combo plate since I wanted to try a wider variety of what they had.  I got their ginger chicken, the jade chicken, the pork fried rice, and the black beans and jerk fried chicken wrapped into a burrito.   Ginger chicken: awesome Jade chicken: awesome Pork fried rice: great but not something you eat just by itself, you've got to mix it up with everything else  Black beans: omg - these are great.  I'm not sure why but they tasted like pizza tomato sauce but hey, pizza tomato sauce tastes good too.  I'll be back again, it was pretty good and while I was sitting at the picnic tables (the plastic folding tables rock) I read up on the history of Chino Bandido online and it's just an all around great story of a super successful family owned establishment that came up with a unique menu and hit a home run.   If you're up for something new and something you won't find elsewhere, swing by and grub.  I'm bringing some friends from London and Hong Kong to eat here later this week.  I'm sure they'll love it.

Let me just start with an apology because I'll probably offend someone I know with this review because the Phoenix Asian community is so small.   Don't get me wrong.  There are some great things here. One being the fUrNiTUre!!  I LOVE the wooden furniture here. I'm not just talking about normal wood furniture here, I'm talking about huge single pieces of wooden slabs being used as bench seats and seat backs. This furniture is wicked.   The service is good too. The waitress spoke fluent Korean and English and knew what my friend Justin wanted when he ordered in Korean.  We had a few dishes. One of which was kimchi tofu soup. It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.  My friend Justin (remember, he's Korean) actually blurted out, this was the worst Kimchi Tofu soup he has ever had. We also had some spicy pork which was marinated not in the traditional spicy PASTE that is normally used but in a chopped up dry spicy chili that covered the meat like it was glitter. The spicy pork dish was supposed to have some sauce and the meat was supposed to be nice and juicy. Nope!  The dish was dry and served on a hot plate on a bed of chopped onions.  Add soju and a hot fish plate with some diet cokes and you suddenly have a bill approaching $50.   As the Germans would say...  "Nicht so gut!!"  So in the end, the meal was summed up by my friend declaring the meal being the worst Korean meal he's ever had.

Saying goodbye to a loved one is never easy and when going through the difficult time of letting a family member go, every bit of help to make the process more comfortable helps.  That pretty much sums up the Hospice of the Valley on Thunderbird and 55th avenue.  The staff there is courteous, considerate, helpful, and always ready to answer any questions one may have regarding the process of letting one go.   Some special thanks go out to Molly, Deanna, and Dr. Sam for helping my family deal with a difficult time in our lives.

I work/live about 10 minutes away and some weeks am at Celsius 3-4 times.  I love this place.  Simply put, the food/experience here is always fun and great.  When you first come into the bar, you notice the black floor and the nice sized aquarium on the right.  Then you're quickly greeted by "the hot hostess of the day" and shown a table.  I normally get a seat in the back because I like to see the TV screen that displays a closed circuit video feed of what the sushi chef is preparing behind the counter.  Nifty.  The ambiance is pretty damn hip.  Hip like, you can't help but feel cool sitting there because the bar has a big wall of alcohol, there's a nice aquarium sitting tall enough to admire from across the room (and out of reach of chopstick wielding children), the black floor gives the place a club-like feel and the music is chosen by the employees which helps convey the overall "with it" vibe of the entire bar.  The food itself is great too.  Although I'm allergic to shellfish I can always find something good to eat here.  Off the top of my head, I'd recommend the following:  * the bomb * vegetable tempura with a side of rice * the seaweed salad (it always tastes crisp and fresh) * the Valentine roll * the Frankenjin roll  One of the best things about this place is it's OPEN LATE!!  These guys are hardcore and don't shut down until midnight so if Delux is too far away and you want something other than In & Out - swing by Celsius.  And ladies, if you're single - all the chefs are too.  haha!

I haven't ever had the BBQ meats here because the other Korean dishes Chodang offers are really good.  The ba bim bop is has really fresh ingredients and comes in a normal temp dish or a stone pot.  I recommend getting the one that comes in the stone pot.    I normally eat the spicy pork soup or tofu soup and both of these dishes are offered in a varying degree of spicy between 1 and 5.  They're supposed to be served relatively spicy so go with a 3 or higher if you can handle it.  Also he soups come piping hot to your granite table and the server will ask if you want an egg added - if you're "ok" with eggs but not sure if it'll taste good with your soup- just say "yes".  Trust me.  The pun chun  (the small dishes of food they bring to you before the meal) is pretty good.  The kimchee is hit and miss but often times it tastes good.  The other dishes seem to vary depending on what they have available but for the most part it's all quite tasty.  I've only eaten here for dinner but I've eaten here often and know that the food is consistently good.  Everyone I've brought with me to this place loves it.    Special note: Slow down and approach at an angle when you drive into the parking lot - it's kinda steep and bumpy.

Swung by IP for lunch today and as always, it was a nice buffet lunch.  They had the 2008 Cricket World Championship on the TV and yep just like the last time I saw the 2008 Cricket World Championship there, the same team won.  Haha, jk, I don't know if it's the same game but more often than not, the TV is turned to a game of Cricket.  For those of you who haven't tried the buffet lunch, swing by and do yourself a favor.  The establishment is clean, the food is nice and hot, the service is great, and the curry chicken is delicious.  If you happen to show up and curry chicken is available - definitely try it.  The sauce looks a tad greasy but c'mon - you only live once right?   In all seriousness though - it's a nice place to load up on Indian food but the buffet has a limited variety day to day.  In fact, it's the SAME thing every day so if you're a creature of habit (like I am) then you'll be happy as a clam but if you're always looking for a variety of Indian dishes, ummm...  become a creature of habit?

Had the seafood butcher cut up a fish head for me at 7:50pm. Got home, realized he sold me fish that was already going bad...  Returned it and the customer service lady said it was the hot summer weather that caused a bunch of the fish to go bad and smell. If she knew that and if the guy in the back could smell the fish, i have no idea why they were still selling it...  I didn't want to get into an argument but I was going to tell her "the temperature on the outside of the refrigerator has no relation to the temperature inside of the fridge."

A friend of mine recommended I check out this coffee shop so I decided to swing by on a lazy Friday afternoon.  I like the layout, the location, the interior and you really feel welcome at this coffee shop.  Awesome!  I perused the menu and picked out a chai tea.  It came out beautifully frothy and smooth.  As I was checking out the artwork on the walls (which are for sale btw) and the huge table in the back area of the shop (which I want for my next house), I noticed some distinct names on the  wines.  The names?  Kungfu Girl on one bottle and Bitch on another.  Haha!  I picked up one of each to add to the wine rack and was pleasantly surprised later to hear from friends that the two bottles were quite tasty.  :) Sweet.

Let me just say that I'm no stranger to donuts and these donuts at Rainbow Donuts Bakery are fantaaaaaaaastic!  I'm not a sweet tooth guy but I inhaled 3 of these in a day and had to give the rest to my friends otherwise I would have eaten the whole dozen.  Like Daren C said - they serve rice bowl meals too and I had the curry one and my friend had the spicy chicken (i think it was the spicy chicken).  Both were full of flavor and served really hot because the owner cooks everything to order.  No microwave stuff here!    I would totally recommend going back to this place to grab a value lunch and probably the best damn donuts on the north side of town.    Yes, they are better than Dunkin Donuts.

This place is the Wal-Mart of pho!! (but thankfully you don't see any www.peopleofwalmart.com customers)  Believe me.  You get a big sized bowl of Pho at a bargain price.    I live near Desert Ridge in north Phoenix and I don't even think twice about driving down to Mesa to eat at Pho Nhat.    The experience:   Like other pho places, they don't pride themselves on interior design, street appeal, etc... they just do what they do best, make great pho.  The building  used to be an old Taco Bell shop and inside, they serve great tasting broth, your body doesn't feel like crap after eating there or even drinking all of the broth, and you come out of there with almost enough savings to go out and buy yourself some boba drinks or at least pay for extra fuel it takes to get there from north Phoenix.

A couple of months ago I experienced a great foot spa massage out in California.  Since then, I've gone to two other places here in AZ where I either ended up aching for 3 weeks afterwards or sat on a chair that didn't recline which prevented any possible massage work on my back.  That all changed when I went to Relax Station Foot Spa.  This place is legit, has been in business for a year and is open until 10pm.  I almost don't want to review I feel like I've discovered a little bit of paradise in Gilbert that will undoubtedly be swamped once people read this...  I'm not saying my reviews are super kick ass or anything but seriously- some of these other foot spas in the area are absolute crap.    Ok, so back to the point of this review - I walk in with my gf and we quickly get seated on some nice sturdy reclineable chairs.  Within just a few minutes, we were already dunking our feet into wooden buckets full of hot water with some herbal medicine mixed into it.  The guy started working on my head and neck, then my hands and snapped each finger which is one little detail that reminded me of the great place in Westminster, CA.  He stretched my arms and shoulders thoroughly with just enough pressure.  He then worked on my feet after drying them off and after the massage, my calves and shins were oily so he wiped them down with a big warm towel.  Ok, you get the picture.  I'm not writing anymore because it's starting to sound like a raunchy Danielle Steele book that you find at the grocery store that's 2" thick and has Fabio on the cover with some damsel in distress.  So afterwards, my gf and I agreed that this place was great and we plan on going back again.  They're professional, well trained, clean, and although it costs a little more than the other places at $30 for an hour, it's worth it.  Comparatively, out in CA, they charge betwen $15-$20.  OK, go there before I delete this and keep this great place to myself.

I stopped by here to grab a bite and to geek out on the computer with the famous Dallas Gold.  The first thing that catches you about the Clarendon Hotel is that it doesn't strike you as a posh place so your expectations are immediately pulled down to the level where you're hoping the lobby has at least one light bulb in it.  Once you step into the place and wander over to the Gallo Blanco Cafe, you quickly realize that this place is the bee's knees, the cat's pajamas, the morning pee, the end of the year bonus, the first drink of happy hour, the first night your newborn sleeps all the way through the night...  it's so wonderful, it makes you want to go outside and share with complete strangers the near-orgasmic experience you just had eating in the cafe...  I started off with a fresh cantaloupe fruit drink and I immediately thought to myself - WHY DON'T I DRINK THIS ALL THE TIME??  Orange juice is soooo... just orange juice!    Then the sandwich came.  I have to be honest, I didn't put much thought into ordering and nonchalantly ordered the Naco Torta because it was the first thing listed under the sandwich section of the one page menu.  I was pleasantly surprised.    The bread was wondeful.  Soft but not so soft the bread flpped back over itself.  Beveled a bit too so it was easy to take the first bite.  The meat was cut up into small pieces to ease the dining experience and the combination of flavors of the avocado slices, the egg, the beef, the whatever else was in my sandwich was unbelievable.    The service was uber helpful and various waiters/waitresses swung by the table to see if we were ok.    Overall, a very cool place to check out if you're near Indian School and 4th ave.  Do yourself and your friends a favor and swing on by to grab a bite.

OMG - THEY HAVE A JONAS BROTHERS EXHIBIT!!    Remember that line, you'll be screaming it later out of shock or pleasure, depending on your age.    I spent a few hours at the MIM today for their pre-grand opening and it was really refreshing.  To be honest, it's something that one would not expect here in Arizona simply because we don't have a history of having art appreciating venues.   I'm attracted to good architecture and interior design so if you don't really appreciate music, at least come for the architecture to observe the space inside, the way each exhibit is displayed, etc... It's really impressive.  For example, almost all the walls have this faux venetian finish that gives the walls a very rich feel.  Upstairs the flooring is mainly wood but they have tile and stone downstairs and in some areas of the museum they have carpet squares like in the store and play area downstairs.  If you're a flip flops kinda person, do yourself a favor and wear some decent tennis shoes.  So yeah, sweet architecture / interior design - check.  Instruments - double check!  Wow.  It's really interesting to see how music can be made with such a variety of instruments.  The instruments displayed are not only interesting because of HOW they make music, but often times, I found myself taking photos of them simply because of their design and the vibrant colors used in the making of the instruments.  Trust me, take a camera or you wish you had.  Nearly every country you can think of is represented and it's nice that they not only have the name of the country displayed but an area map with the country highlighted for those who are geographically challenged.  One particular aspect of this museum that makes it so great is that not only do you get to see the variety of musical instruments around the world, you also get location sensitive headphones to hear HOW THEY SOUND at each exhibit.  So if you are near an exhibit showcasing Steinway pianos, you'll hear the audio that corresponds to the video covering the build process of the pianos.  Checking out the drums from Africa? Yep, there's audio to that too.  Cool.  Would I go again? Yep.  I think it's a great place to take kids who are interested in music and to let them learn to appreciate how music is made around the world.

Forget whatever you know about sushi and come to ShinBay. The food here is wonderful and each dish pushes the envelope of what you know as the "best tasting sushi you've ever tried..."    Don't get me wrong, there are several nice sushi places around town but ShinBay doesn't hold back on the quality of fish they use so the end result on your plate is PHENOMENAL. Go try it and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. :)

Got 11 bucks?  Go get yourself an El Paso Omelette from the OBH on 32nd street and Thunderbird.  That dish is THE BEST BREAKFAST FOR $12 in the Paradise Valley, North Phoenix area.  This omelet is filled with chorizo, roasted green chilies, tomato, onion, black beans, and cheddar cheese.  It comes with guacamole, pico de gallo and sour cream on the side + Pancakes + Hashbrowns.  All for $12, WHAAAAT!?   Seriously best brunch in a 5 mile radius.  Drop whatever you're doing and go get it now.
