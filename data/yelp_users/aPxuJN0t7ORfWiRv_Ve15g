I met David several years ago at the local home improvement event in the community center. I asked him questions on energy saving project ideas, and he was very patience answer each of them honestly and professionally. Well...I can't speak for everyone, but for me a good general Q & A session is kind of like tasting fine wine...there is the initial impression, the way it tastes while drinking, and the feeling you're left with afterward. In early September, I purchased my first house. I immediately thought David and his company to help me run an energy audit. I had used another local energy audit company for my parents' house before that recommended from a popular Saturday morning radio host talk show, but the experience was not satisfy as I need. I familiar the energy audit concept and it process. Yet I decided to use different company and have David and his company for fresh ideas. David and his crew did not let me down. His inspector Mike arrived on time. He gave me 10 compact-fluorescent lightbulbs, a low-flow showerhead and faucet aerators, worth about $50, as part of energy audit deal. He climbed up to the roof and checked my rooftop A/C manufactory date and model number. He walked around my house, measured its circumference, drew out the basic floor plan, label the windows, doors, and vents location. He also performed a blower door test and checked each room air pressures. Mike took a lot of notes, examined every corner, and looked for improvements. The whole energy audit took over 6 hours.   Few days later, David e-mail me 10 pages custom energy checkup report along with recommend improvement projects pricing. On the checkup report, I can see David had spent lots of time to prepare it. It is not a so-so generic report and my previous energy audit company was not prepare something as details as David does. It has pictures, charts, tables and graphs in color. It includes my home annual energy-use pie chart, APS before and after installed CFL lightbulbs, low-flow showerhead and faucet aerators bar charts, recommendation projects with cost & saving table, side by side comparison of the estimated annual energy costs of my home, and the definition and reasons for each energy improvement project.    After reading the report with many counter questions regarding the recommendation list, I decided to have a R 38 insulation, duct sealing, air sealing, and install jump ducts in master bedroom for room pressure relief to circulate air back to the return when the door is closed. His contractors also arrived on time and spent over 7.5 hours complete all the recommendation projects. They did not leave me any trash and dusts for me to clean up. The whole job was completed so professionally, I highly recommend David. They were about the same price as anybody else so it's good. The best part is I asked David for a cash pay discount option and he accommodate my request and understand college student's need to save me money. I'll use David and his company again if my family got another house that needed insulation. Overall, he was very pleasant to work with and did a great job!

Beautiful interior design with tiffany lights lighting and granite countertop bathroom. Jasmine Tokyo picks a good location and serves great food to North Phoenix and Scottsdale area. I went to Sunday happy hour. The Sushi bar and crab legs are my favorite with many selections. Four types of Asian soups are distinguished to other local Asian buffet restaurants. The deep fried spicy chicken wings are very crispy and juicy.  I really like the ice cream and its creamy taste and various selection desert bars. I can't wait to come back again.

This was my third times went there (2 Saturday dinners and 1 weekday lunch). I love that place. Every time I will find some new dishes filling up my stomach. Besides my regular chooses such as crab legs, sashimi, and strawberry yogurt, I try walnut shrimps, roasted duck, cocktail shrimps and mango ice cream. Food of Jasmine Tokyo never let me down and looking forward my next tasty adventure.

I am a long-time Jasmine Tokyo cater since its grand opening on 2011. Tonight, I brought my family for dinner again from 5:00 to 6:30 pm. I am not sure I went there early or what. Once the cooked dishes were empty, the cookers did not prepare new one. This happened included roasted duck, fruit (watermelon, honeydew, and cantaloupe.), and deep fried shrimps. I understand business may want to save some dimes for not bringing out dishes as frequent as possible to save its margin, yet it is unacceptable for Scottsdale buffet restaurant that charge over $22 per person to keep empty dishes over 15 minute's time frame in a non-rush hour. Inside the restaurant, there were at least twenty people in here.  I wish the management can make improvements on the food control and dessert table in the future.

I love Vietnamese food and have at least once per month. Yet I hardly find a good and decent price one in North Phoenix area, I usually go to Da Vang more than a decade. Until today, my Vietnamese girlfriend wanted to try some pho in my area. I bring her to this new place in PV mall. Like others mentioned, the owner set the price is very comparable and low price than its neighbor food court competitors like Panda Express or Osaka. She loves the meatball pho, the soup is very tasty and warm. She even said the soup is very similar than her home made one. I order the daily special pork chop with salad/eggroll #1 combo. The eggroll is very crispy and I saw the chef deep fry when I ordered. The taste is great and better many Chinese restaurants I went. I can taste some soysauce and meat in it. I think it is homemade, not the one from Costco or supermarket nation brand one.  The pork chop is huge almost covers half of the box, soft and juicy, with a bone. I also like its side salad. They use the Japanese ginger lime juice dressing. I also have a small bowl of chicken soup. I enjoy that place a lot, especially close to home and it is not expensive than Viet Kitchen Restaurant locate at Cave Creek Road.
