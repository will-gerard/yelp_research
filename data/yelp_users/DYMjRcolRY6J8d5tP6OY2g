Not one to usually complain, but wow.  Pretty terrible experience here.  Didn't even get to have the food because we had to wait so long.  First off, this place is in a pretty bad part of town.  Right across from a correctional facility.  We sat down and a server didn't come to take our drink order for 10 minutes.  Then when we placed our order, we waited another 15 minutes.  Wondering what happened to our order, we asked the waitress to check on it and she said the kitchen had lost it.  When we asked if they could just make ours now, she said there were other orders before ours. The pozole was already made...   So we just decided to leave. They didn't even offer to comp the drinks lol.

The magic of the Internet.  I never spoke with Bob until he arrived at my house.  He's super quick at responding on Yelp, so if you need a quote, just send him a message.  I had contacted Bob for an estimate a couple of months ago.  Some good friends of ours gave us wallpaper as a gift, and we wanted it hung properly by a professional.  He even advised us on how much wallpaper we'd need based on the dimensions of our walls.  Bob and his assistant did an outstanding job.  They arrived on time, we're professional, and actually quite entertaining.  I never would have thought to cover the switch panels in the paper too, but they did and it turned out great.  Bob has been hanging wallpaper for as long as I've been alive.  He must be doing something right.

I really wish there were better gym options in this neighborhood.  It seems like all of the good ones (mountainside, lifetime) stick to the suburbs.  I've been to other LA fitnesses that are better than this one.  I'm told that they bought out an existing gym and didn't do many renovations or upgrades when it became LA.   It's in a really convenient location for me, but if you go during peak times it's crazy busy.  The locker rooms and showers aren't great either, I prefer waiting until I get home.  Has all of he necessities though.

If you're looking for the best pho in Phoenix, you can stop your search immediately and go directly to this place.   If you're looking for great friendly service, keep searching.  Pho thanh is notorious for its amazing food and apathetic service.  Your business won't be appreciated, but you will be served quickly and you'll still be happy.   Not sure what to order?? The egg rolls are delicious for an appetizer.  The Thai iced tea or iced offer are superb.  My favorite entree is the pho soup with rice noodles and filet mignon (add vegetables).

It's a shame that a well designed Mexican restaurant automatically makes me think that the food isn't going to taste authentic.  Los Taquitos definitely proves that theory wrong.  Every time I'm craving really good pozole this is my go to place.  I found them on Yelp and I'm so glad I did.  The vibe is great - well lit, plenty of options for seating (even a patio).  The service is great too, I think the woman who runs the register and takes your order is the owner.  It's counter service, so don't expect a server.  The food is so good.  I've had the red pozole multiple times and loved it.  Also had their chorizo burrito and tacos.  All yummy.  Great little neighborhood spot and one of the best places to go for pozole in Phoenix.

Mountainside fitness knows what a visit to the gym should be - clean, with great equipment, at a reasonable price.  Rumor has it that this location at Chase Field was actually for advertising.  If you ever go, you'll notice that the membership is really low.  Most of the time the gym is empty with maybe 5-10 people working out at any given time.  It's great for members though because you never have trouble finding a machine or weights.  The equipment is all in excellent condition and they definitely keep the place really clean. It doesn't have a pool, basketball court, or racquetball - but it does have plenty of weight machines downstairs with cardio machines upstairs.  I've never seen a class, but they do have them (just not a very robust schedule).  I like to go at lunch since my work is nearby.  The locker rooms are always clean (which is really important to me) and they provide clean towels as part of their standard membership.  And don't worry, the windows are covered so you won't be stared at like a fish tank if there is an event at Chase field.

I'm not a hairy guy, but man does my hair grow FAST.  Some guys can keep a haircut looking fresh for 2-3 weeks, but not me.  I need my hair cut every 7-10 days to look on point.  So when I first heard about an unlimited haircut membership for under $30/month, I was pretty much sold as long as they did a good job.  Now, this place is different than a barber shop.  The stylists are able to cut hair and give you a shampoo and style, but they won't be giving you a shave or straight-edge razoring any of your lines.  You'll still need to go to a barber shop if that's the level of service you're looking for.  But for what they offer, I really like Keep it Cut.  All of the stylists are good, but once you find one that you like, I recommend going back to that same one so you can have a consistent cut.  You can use their app to see if your stylist is working and check-in before you get to the shop.  In addition to the great pricing, the ambiance is pretty cool.  They have (clean) hip hop playing, a modern/industrial design, garage doors that open when the weather is nice, and a selection of products by Crew.  If you're a guy and you get your haircut regularly and don't need the extra level of service that comes from seeing a barber, this is a great option for you.  And don't be cheap, leave a nice tip for the stylists.

I love the Upton because it offers something really unique in Scottsdale.  Surrounding it are your typical old town bars and restaurants, but the Upton's charm sets it apart.  Every time I go here, I forget I'm in Arizona.  If you work in the area, their lunch special is fantastic.  I've also been there for happy hour.  The food and drinks are delicious, but what I really fell in love with is the hip ambiance.  If possible, get a spot on the back patio.

I was so impressed with everything about my experience at chateau luxe.  While it is off the beaten path, it's nestled in the most beautiful location with a back patio facing some beautiful Arizona foothills.   We were here for an Equality Arizona awards dinner.  Everything from the service to the decor to the food quality was top notch.  If you are thinking of having an event here, your guests will be well taken care of.

We first stumbled across this little Mexican grocery store when we were driving down 16th street.  On the weekends, they grill fresh pollo asado in the front lot, and the billowing smoke caught our eye.  When we stopped in, we found out not only can you get the most amazing pollo asado in Phoenix, but this place has the best quality butcher's meat in town.  Everything is extremely clean and fresh.  There is a small produce area, pan dulce, beer, and everything else you would find in a corner market.  The prices are extremely reasonable, and the employees are all friendly and willing to help.  We find ourselves purchasing about half of our weekly groceries from this local grocer since they do such an amazing job.  If you are looking for a great Mexican grocery store in Phoenix, this is your place.

I love to see healthy franchises popping up left and right.  I accidentally stumbled upon Mad Greens when I was going to get a juice at nearby Nektar.  It had just opened, so I gave it a try.  I was really impressed.  If it's your first time, I recommend going with one of the menu salads.  If you try to build your own, there are soooo many options it can be overwhelming.  And I can only imagine how annoying that is for the workers ("can I have some of those beans?  No wait do I want beans?  Let's do quinoa.  No, actually make that chicken")  If you want to eat healthy and actually get full, this is the place for you.  Pro tip:  order ahead online and skip the line (even though there hasn't been one when I've went).  It also helps reduce that "what should I order?" anxiety.

Just about the cutest little neighborhood breakfast restaurant I've ever been to.  I love going out to breakfast, but if there is a line or it's super crowded, it kills the whole experience.  Duza's is perfect.  The decor is super charming, with little jars of fresh flowers, antique furniture, coffee house tunes, delicious food, and friendly service.    They offer counter service, which is just fine for me.  When the weather is nice, they have lots of great outdoor seating in the front and back.  You have to try it out.
