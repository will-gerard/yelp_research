What a Gem. This is the perfect venue for local theater. They even have a bar and resto  that is good!  Saw "when you wish" the Disney story and it was very good. Cannot wait to return to see more shows. Phoenix is fortunate to have such a wonderful venue!!

Attended last night at Symphony Hall and enjoyed it very much. I have heard this orchestra several times over the past 2 years and they are very good! Last night was  Bernstein with a violin soloist and the a Sibelius Symphony. Both were performed well. I did have trouble deciding who was over acting. The soloist or the concert master? Their body movements were way too much. I get it with the soloist but should not see that in the principle. We are fortunate to have such a fine orchestra here on Phoenix.

You could easily drive/walk past this place and dismiss it, but don't!!  CJ runs a fun little drinking establishment that happens to serve great food! Large numbers of regulars occupy the bar. You will see a huge variety of age groups. Great burgers, really love the meatloaf sandwich. They have regular daily specials.

What can I say about my local happy hour/dinner favorite in Phoenix. They effectively cover all the bases for a great local resto. Chef prepares great apps, get on the email list if you are not already, and has a perfect range of entries that cover most appetites. Food is always prepared perfectly and the bar is a great place to gather. Can't go wrong here. Planked Salmon, bacon wrapped shrimp and the Hummus plate are faves!  Get some!!

As dive bars go this can't be beat! Do drop in to this establishment at Christmas if for no other reason than to see the lights. This can be a quiet little place at happy hour with many regulars. BUT, late night this place is packed wall to wall. Does attract quite the alternative crowd but never an issue for me. Cheap drinks a good pool table and a few other games. Nice juke box. Give it a try.

This has always been a go to place for me. The downstairs bar and dining area with the fireplace has been a winter favorite. I went last week for happy hour and a bite. The food as usual was amazing. Sadly the downstairs bar staff were amazingly bad. Incorrect drink refills, arrogant and incredibly slow service. The tenderloin toasts and the chicken skewers are great apps too share. I will return to this place but will be dining upstairs!

I have visited the Mansion Club the past two Saturday nights and find it to be as close to a private club atmosphere as you can attain in a public space. Drinks and apps in the bar followed by dinner. Great filet for me  lamb shank for my girlfriend. I will be a regular here!

This is a small and simple place that happens to make incredible pizza!  The crust is thin and crispy with a flavor that reminds me of Pizza in New York. They offer many specials. I ordered for pick up and it was ready when I got there. They were very nice and I will be having their pizza many times in the future!

Quite possibly the best Hot Italian Sandwich I have ever had. Great service, the location is not the best but the owner here also owns 13 North in the same little shopping center. (Go there BTW!!) I had enjoyed Stumpy's Pizza in the past but never the sub. Had an opportunity to drop in and am very glad I did. If you like a hot italian cold cut sub go get this!!

Went for the 3rd annual Grooves Hooves and BarBQ event held by by the owners of Aunt Chilada's and Rustlers Rooste. What a fun event. Live music, several bars. Indoor or out door seating and great food. They roasted several pigs and also offered beef ribs. All the usual corn and brand etc. Staff was great, the facility is lots of fun and everyone had a great time. Hoping they do it again next year.

Having used Papyrus for cards and gif wrapping before I went expecting to get a gift purchased elsewhere wrapped and to purchase a nice card. The staff looked as if I had slapped them with a wet fish when I asked them to wrap the gift. The item was a small purse and I had a gift box. We selected the paper and the wrapping began. After tearing the paper twice and having to start over, the two aides started helping other clients and not finishing my gift. After some back and forth they completed the task for a grand total of 30 dollars!! I kid you not! for gift wrapping an item that was already boxed. Thanks but no thanks Papyrus!

This Zoo is special. If you go with your first impression you may leave disappointed. If you have a love of nature and know a little something about animal conservation and  zoology you will love this place. Did a little deeper and you will learn that this is in the top 30 zoos in the world largely because it is focused on preservation of endangered and extinct speciesL They have been recognized for their work in ornithology having successfully bred several species previously not bred in captivity. The collection is vast.  Do check out the nursery where you can see newborns from the zoo. We saw a pair of lion cub twins born Jan 30 2016. So cute! This place is bigger than is seems so allow time. There is a full service resto  that is part of a local chain of seafood restos. Very good and even has live music on weekends. Give this place a try. If you pay attention you will realize what you are seeing!!

Fun place to stop during a bike ride. Cold drinks and on weekends often a cook out or live band. It's the ultimate old Scottsdale dive bar!. Bartenders are attentive and the staff runs a good operation. While we were there they had a tent set up in the parking lot with a band and cookout serving burgers and dogs for tips. Enjoyed yet another visit to the Coach House!

Stopped in at they Old Scottsdale establishment mid ride recently. Had a few beers in the upstairs roof bar. Great service and friendly staff. Learned from a local about their Pizzas!!! What a find. Very good and many people call in for take out. Super thin crispy crust and lots of choices for toppings. Not New York Pizza, not trying to be. These are great!  Going back soon!

Visited the bar for happy hour last week pre theater. We had eaten there before but were seated at a table. This time the bar felt right and we had heard good things about their happy hour. We were not mis informed!! WOW. The apps in the bar are great!! We had the stuffed mushrooms, the garlic shrimp and the baked brie. The Brie and shrooms were amazing. Te shrimp taste great but the melted cheese on top is somehow not right. Messy and hard to deal with and really not necessary with such good shrimp and garlic sauce. The specialty cocktails are tasty and their house pours are pretty stiff! They have a good crowd for happy hour so getting two seats at the bar was a stroke of luck. Do try the house made potato chips that they put on the bar during happy hour  very very good. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will return soon!

This Frank Lloyd Wright beauty is showing her age and needs some TLC but great acoustics and a really nice place to see the theater. Watched the road tour of 42nd Street last night. Easy parking plenty of rickshaws to pop down Mill Ave for a ore show dinner. A great evening in a grand old building!

This was my first visit to Gallagher's in Las Vegas. The original in Manhattan was my first NY Chophouse experience and has stuck with me for a lifetime. I had to order the exact thing I had in my first visit to the city some 25 years ago. Small filet with a salad and creamed spinach. YUM. The Las Vegas Gallagher's lives up to the reputation of it's Manhattan big brother!! Get some!!

Great place to find bargains if you have the time. This is where all the unsold stuff from Nordstom's and Nordstrom's Rack goes to die. Caution, it is also the place that all the damaged and returned items go to die. You will see shoes that look like they were worn for a month and returned. They probably were. If you know anything about Nordstrom's you know that they have amazing customer service and returns are not argued. They try to recoup their loss at this store. Can't blame them. So, shopper beware. There are amazing bargains to be had on designer high quality shoes and clothing for the whole family here, BUT, inspect everything carefully in the changing room. All that said I have purchased men's 1000$ suits for 149$ in this store!  Love it!

I am a fan of The Palm and have been since my first visit to the original Palm years ago in NY. Consistently good in all locations. We had dinner at this Palm on a recent Vegas trip. The place is located in the Forum Shops section of Caesar's Palace. Easy access from valet parking.  Great outside seating to people watch or romantic tables and private dining inside. Nice bar as well. Steak and lamb chops were what we had and they were as expected, perfect. A wonderful meal though our server was not up to Palm standards. Forgot to place our drink order and kinda left us hanging. One of the other servers rescued us. All in all a wonderful meal. Join their 837 club it's great!

Went pre theater and pre Tour de Tempe recently and we were seated at the bar. On both occasions the service was lackluster at best. The bar was not clean. There was a cast of characters behind the bar that stumbled all over themselves attempting to serve people but the result of this totally uncoordinated effort was that none of the guests received good service LOL. We waited over 10 minutes for one of our cocktails and it was not a specialty drink. Soup was ok but not hot. Spring rolls were good lettuce wraps were what you expect. The shrimp fired rice dish was terrible. So I am over PF Chang's. Plenty of local restos to support!!

The oompa band was a blast!  I visited last night and enjoyed the place! Went early before the Glendale lights and a local theater performance. Sat at the bar where I enjoyed a bit of German Suds. We had the stuffed mushroom appetizer and probably would not have that again. Broiled shrooms w really good Italian sausage stuffing. The combo of the melted Parmesan and then the balsamic vinegar just had too many tastes going on for us. The soup was a very good pork and apple!! We loved it! We shared the pork shank w sauerkraut and German fried potatoes. Very nice. The Tuba player from the oompah band was engaging and they played for us at the bar. We had a blast and would definitely return.

Don't go if you can't understand the ambiance of a 70's/80's steak house. Do go if you enjoy an old school salad bar, great steaks and lamb and excellent service. This is not The Palm or Del Frisco, not trying to be. Old style and old fashioned friendly service by owner, family and staff. Ribs, and lamb chops, Spanokopita (sp?), twice baked potato and a great salad were our choices. Enjoyed these sitting at the bar and encountered a lovely and very helpful bartender. We plan to return often!!

I would never have found this place but am so glad I did!  Friday night dinner, a rainy evening so no band but what a great evening anyway. Great cocktails followed by amazing apps ( try the cornbread w chicken, black beans and spicy cabbage app, sounds wild but is amazing). Spinach salad was great and the seafood stuffed chiles were perfect!  I will definitely go back. BTW they have some terrific desert cocktails too!!

Made my second visit to Fuego last night. Went with very high expectations after the great evening we had last time. The food is still amazing. Had the house special pasta dish the cornbread appetizer which is a meal unto itself and the New York strip which was the evening special. All of the food was terrific!!  Really look forward to our next visit for the food and cocktails, BUT, the young lady who was our wait person was incredibly slow and in-attentive. Something I don't appreciate when paying for a fine meal. Here is hoping management can fix this issue. I would also suggest selecting a musician who does not have a tin ear for the entertainment. We do look forward to visiting again!

As a displaced southerner looking for the ingredients for a proper southern new years day meal of collards w ham hocks and "hopping John" I was challenged in Phoenix. I tried my usual haunts of Sprouts on Gledale at 16th and also Safeway on Glendale  at 7th to no avail. "We did not get our delivery" said the produce manager. I stumbled on the Bashas' on 7th and was able to get all ingredients to include cornbread at noon on New years day and save a proper southern new years day meal!! I will be shopping there going forward.

The excellent jazz saved the day. We went for a birthday brunch w a group of 4. Made the reservation on open table advising two birthdays and requesting an outside table. We got a great table outside, water and silver provided quickly, and then we sat. A considerable time later a waiter came by and we placed our order.  Rather than bring our coffee she took orders from two additional tables before even getting coffee served. Our group tried several dishes. None memorable and one even returned the tomato eggs as it was not very good. After prompting we did get a birthday desert ( clearly they never read the comments on the reservation). In summary, just ok food, poor service, dirty coffee cups but good jazz. I think we will stick w brunch at Chelsea's Kitchen!

Attended a performance of "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" at the theater of PVCC at Union Hills and 32nd St last week. The theater is very nice and the grounds very attractive. This was true local community theater. The props and sets were very good. The live pit orchestra was a treat as most pro and semi pro troupes have gone to recorded music (yuk). The orchestra was also very good. Several of the actors were very good and some were in over their heads. Musicals are tough for local theater as we are not all gifted singers LOL. All in all this was a great performance if you enjoy community theater. Great efforts and a nice venue!!

I had been wanting to try this place for a while and am so glad that I did. First off I am no stranger to The Caribbean, Jamaica or Rum. This is extremely creative food in a very hip funky space. The staff has it going on. Very organized, almost orchestrated to make your dining experience flow as smoothly as the sweet reggae music in the background. We had 3 small plates and then split an entree. The plantains with a mango dipping sauce were terrific as were the scallops. The heat of the Scotch bonnet peppers was evident and went very well with the most excellent cocktails that they serve. We had Hemingway's Daiquiri and the punch bowl special. Truly magical! next came the jerk shrimp small plate and the Jerk Pork entree. Amazing shrimp that had a sweet hot fruity sauce around the bowl to go with the Johnny cakes and a home made tarter sauce for the shrimp. Very good. The Jerk Pork over polenta was a very creative dish. Not a large portion but we found it to be just right. Decided to have 1 more cocktail before leaving for the Symphony. Asked the waiter to bring me a sipping rum over ice. He asked me a few flavor questions and a price range ( the range is from 8 to 2500, yes two thousand five hundred, dollars per glass. The rum collection is vast and comes from all over the world!!) the glass of rum arrived with a single large cube of ice and was the best rum I have ever tasted. M had the Velvet and vinyl which she loved. We decided right then to return after the Symphony for desert!! We did and sitting at the amazing bar she had a desert cocktail, a sea salt and caramel rum desert drink that was wild and rum cake while I sipped another daiquiri. I can't recommend this place strongly enough. The bartenders will educate you about rum and you get to watch them make some great cocktails as well. Do go here and try it all!!

Great place. I had been once before but this time for brunch. They normally do not take reservations for less than 8. I explained that we had a grandmother with us and if at all possible we would like for for he to not stand in the heat. They were wonderful and held a table for us. Brunch was very good. The egg dishes were well done and everything was well presented. All agreed that the food was terific. We will definitely return. They had some specials posted like a bottle of wine and bruchettes for $20 that looked great and we learned about 5$ pitchers of beer before 5PM every day!! What's not to love! Get some!

Love this place!  I enjoyed this location much more than the old town Scottsdale location. Great vibe in s growing area. We had cocktails "Painkiller" is the bomb!, the Ceviche which was great. And then salads, one w Cajun Blackened Tuna the other w Grilled Shrimp.  All very very good. One caution the Blackened Cajun Tuna is very hot so be warned. What a fun place w great stuff and great food. Will be back!!

Should have known this would be the ultimate tourist trap but it was time for a break. Stopped in after shopping the miracle mile. Great view of Bellagio fountains but too much of the usual obnoxious Vegas Stuff. You know the street beggars and entertainers/impersonators. Waited forever for drinks and food. Would not go back. Wish this place was inside Cosmo. Would be fun!!

I have visited Rico's before and now live in the area. My girlfriend and I walked there Friday night thinking a casual drink and a snack might end the week well. Boy were we wrong. Slow and disheveled bar staff, beer coolers behind the bar that are streaked with God knows what and show no recent signs of cleaning. A sticky bar top was the last straw. After one drink and having to send up s flare to get my bill we left and walked across the street for a nice meal.  As a Hilton Diamond  I find this place totally unacceptable for a resort of this type and intend to make this known to Hilton. Avoid this place until they fix it up!!

Went for my fourth visit to this Phoenix downtown staple. My first visit was a few years ago when I hosted s large group business dinner that was great!  Since then each visit just gets worse. This time a 530 early bite before attending the Symphony. We arrived and the hostesses were great our reservation was ready as arranged. We opted to sit at the bar as spots were available. We ordered a cocktail from a particularly non communicative bartender and asked a few questions about the menu to which we got one line answers. I was having a bad feeling about this. Cocktails came and my partners drink was fabulous. A rum cocktail w muddled fruit that she said was great. We toasted the evening and I noticed that my vodka tonic was not quite right. The tonic mix had run out on the bartenders gun. Hey it happens. The resolution to this small issue ruined the evening. The staff were rude and not helpful They did comp the drink and I did tip appropriately but we left without having dinner and will not return. I cannot imagine how this place stays so busy when we have seen nothing but poor performance on three out of four visits. Oh yes, Location, Location, Location.

I cannot believe that in 3 years of living in Phoenix within 5 miles of this place I had never heard of it!!  Shame on me!  Was out for a Friday afternoon bike ride along the canal and had a tip from a friend about this place. On a whim at the end of our ride decided to check it out. At first glance just ok. So so bike rack and limited parking in a not great area. Oh boy do they make up for that!! Sat at the bar after locking up the bikes. Had an amazing view of the wood oven and the super cool guy that cooks in that oven "Chewy". Watched everything on the menu come out of the oven. A great way to check out the place. Bar tenders were great, managers great. Big crowd on an early Friday night. "Chewy" gave us a taste of an amazing ceviche of scallops and we were sold then on the wood fired diver scallops. These are cooked at super high temps in the oven and the served with a pesto sauce and garnished with micro greens and topped off with Parmesan!  Awesome is an understatement!  We were just in for drinks and an app as were in bike clothes and had to get home. Cannot wait to return for dinner. Things we saw being cooked that looked exciting  were: wood fired Ahi, spinach dip, bruschetta w portobello and Brie w balsamic, the wood fired wings looked amazing. We will be back soon!!

Where else can you arrive by any known mode of two wheeled transportation, walk straight up to the bartender on the very cool deck and ask to borrow a bike lock? That's right they have bike locks plenty of bike racks and tools that you can use if you are in need of a quick repair or tune up. It is also incredibly four legged canine friendly. I always meet a cute or fun dog and owner when I go there. Best bike friendly place in Phoenix!! The food is good. Bar service on the deck is just OK if you sit at the bar because the bartenders are getting killed with the service bar which they run as well. The place more than makes up for that in atmosphere with the bikes and dogs. Great beers and amazing beef jerky are nice treats here. They also have free dog treats!!

We were foolish enough to attend the Elvis's Birthday Show at this venue. Not sure what we expected but what was delivered was shockingly poor. Smelly people, an MC in a purple suit, beer bottles clanking on a cement floor, a sound system that supports bass and drums only, seats with no view, and all this before the show even starts. We left after the second song by the warm up Elvis Impersonator. Just say no to attending anything at this venue!!

Having lived in Louisiana for some time and learning to cook there I was skeptical about a Cajun seafood boil in AZ. I was gravely mistaken!!  This pace is set to look like a fish shack, it's noisy, you can draw on the tables, the staff are fun. The food, well you just cannot go wrong!! We had Alligator bites to start with an almost Remoulade dipping sauce, spicy and good. My partner had the mussels w bread. These were some of the largest cleanest mussels I have ever tasted. Very very good. I had shrimp w potatoes and sausage. This was what I call a Low Country Boil. I selected the Trifecta for the sauce and medium heat for the spice. These are I'm guessing 15-18 count shrimp cooked w heads and done just right! The sausage was spicy and good! Probably would pass on the potatoes next time. Loved this place!! Here is a tip, the sauces are very messy and the concept is to eat with your hands. They will provide a fork if you ask or you can get gloves. Prepare to get messy and enjoy some great seafood!!

A good hand wash and detailing company. Polite helpful staff great location. About 20 minutes for a hand wash and wax. This was my third visit and other than a pet peeve of having the front windshield spotless ( which they did not achieve) I think they do ok work.

A good hand wash and detailing company. Polite helpful staff great location. About 20 minutes for a hand wash and wax. This was my third visit and other than a pet peeve of having the front windshield spotless ( which they did not achieve) I think they do ok work. Update: this place was just sold to the owner of Harvey's Wineburger and they are doing a promo. Take your car wash receipt to Harvey's next door for a free burger!!

Stopped in for happy hour recently on a Saturday afternoon. The food was every bit as good as I had been lead to believe. There is a heavy southern influence to the menu. (I am from Spartanburg and Charleston SC). We had cocktails and the Fried Green Tomatoes, the amazing hushpuppies, and the chef's version of shrimp and grits all as appetizer portion which we shared. The Fried Green tomatoes are great. Light breading and fried to a slight brown. Not greasy at all and served with a spicy remoulade. The hushpuppies were perfect. Real southerners do NOT put sugar in their hushpuppies and these were perfect! Served hot in a paper cone and covered with blue cheese and bacon crumbles!! Really Good!  Shrimp and Grits and I have a deeply personal relationship. I cook shrimp and grits as did my mother father and grandparents and family before them. This version is in my opinion unique, having shrimp AND smoked sausage in a really good brown sauce served over a grits cake. Flavors were great. This was a first having sausage in Shrimp and grits and I loved it!  I would have given this place a 5 and would still like to but I have to comment upon the bar tender and wait person, a guy. We walked in around 4PM. There were a number of people there and no seats at the bar so the young man who greeted us sat us at a table. He was extremely over the top friendly, animated and in your face. Trying to be funny and not succeeding. We told him we would order our drinks and wait for a spot at the bar. Which we did. Just as our drinks arrived we moved to the bar. The waiter seemed less than pleased and the bartender pretty much ignored us. Seemed as if the waiter was displeased to loose a tip from our table. He spoke with us later and was even more in your face and abrupt. I expressed to the bartender that I was not amused. I still tipped correctly.  Management/or Chef should blind shop this place on the weekend. The comment from my GF was that the waiter and the bartender were high. She is in the hospitality business and I am a very experienced traveller and foodie. These two were not what they should have been.   Loved your food chef, and we will be back.

If you like a Louisiana/deep south Crab and Seafood Shack atmosphere where you drink beer from the bottle and eat with your hands, GO HERE! If you are thinking Ocean Club do not go here. The venue is rustic, its intended that way, you will get your hands messy, and you will enjoy it! Have been to two locations and this one is my fav. You sit at a table with a paper cloth and markers, feel free to practice your art or graffiti, whatever. Basically you select your seafood protein, select the sauce for it to be steamed in, then select the heat level.(medium is hot). Add veggies bread hushpuppies etc. Enjoy a cold Fresh Squeezed IPA and suddenly your waiter appears with a "Boil in Bag" full of crustacean, or fish  goodness. You eat with your hands here but they pre open the mussels( which are amazing) shrimp are large and tasty. Great bread and the hushpuppies have a bit of pepper in them for a South Western kick.  TIP: If you don't want to get messy ask for gloves when they bring your bib!!  Relax and enjoy, it is a wonderful place!

Stopped in for a drink after a Pops concert. Friendly hostess and bar staff, cool decor, interesting menu. Was described to us as an "Irish Pub". Ok I see the parallel but this place is more. Observed several interesting dishes enjoyed by fellow bar patrons. I cannot wait to return to enjoy them myself. As a man who knows a bit about shrimp I saw the shrimp and chips dish and it killed me not to try that night. I will be back soon to enjoy the food!!

Let me begin this review by stating up front that I am a Marriott fan as well as a Platinum member of their rewards program. I stay in Marriott's a lot. I recently spent an amazing anniversary weekend at The Camby. I did so with some concern as I had read several previous reviews that were unkind to say the least. First the history; yes, this was the former Ritz Carlton Hotel. If you have experienced staying with Ritz Carlton you will know that these hotels go to extreme lengths to ensure that your stay is of extreme quality but most importantly the same gracious experience at each facility. The Camby is a member of the Autograph Collection  of Marriott. This is a subset of exquisite boutique style hotels that all go to great lengths to ensure that your stay is of extreme quality BUT Autograph Hotels are meant to be unique and different in every way. So if you are expecting Ritz carlton this is not that place. This is a fun quirky place, amazingly different art work and theme targeted at a youngish crowd, but hey I'm in my 50's and had a blast! We did a Saturday and Sunday nights stay. Everything was great. The lounge downstairs has two great rooms, one with a super fireplace, and an adjoining room with a huge TV and lounges. Great bartenders and snacks in the lounge. Do check out the real honeycomb that they use for making the namesake drink!!   Rooms are decorated uniquely. Very modern art. My only complaint in the room was the chair at the dresser. It is a decorative chair, not a work chair. Sitting there doing computer work would be rough. This was not a work stay for me so no worries. Very comfortable room with robes for two.  The pool on the roof of floor 2 is great. Small pool with great food and drink service. They had yoga at 1030 on Sunday morning and about 50 people were there. The Spa is on this floor as well and outside there are two great ping pong tables and lounge seating for many people. We spent the day up here both days playing ping pong and getting sun. Cool music! BTW the pool is open 24/7!!! Wish they had a hot tub  Breakfast is very reasonably priced for a hotel of this calibre. Platinum members get a certificate for 15$ per person to apply to breakfast making it essentially free. There is no Concierge Lounge here, that is the reason for this. They bring fresh homed biscuits to the table at breakfast and they are really good. All food is locally and sustainably sourced. Great preparation and service.   Staff here are great. I cannot recommend this hotel enough! No it is not a cookie cutter Ritz Carlton, they are trying hard not to be!! Enjoy!!

Well it finally opened. Pomelo is a new resto by the owners of Luci's. The complex features plenty of outdoor seating with misters in a great looking courtyard. Indoors has two dining rooms and a private dining room. The bar is well set up and staff friendly. The menu features some interesting starters, great looking salads and a small assortment of house specialties that range from  ribeye to halibut and ribs to pasta. They also have some great looking pizzas. Nice jazz plays throughout. This is an upscale on the inside casual on the outside kinda place. Moderately priced with entrees ranging from 14$ to 28$. I just stopped in for a nice IPA and to check it out on opening day and cannot wait to return for dinner!
