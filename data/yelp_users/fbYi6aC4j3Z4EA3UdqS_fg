The wings here are awesome! So many flavors to choose from, and each one is finger-lickin delicious! The prices are very reasonable, and the service is very good. In case if you're not into wings, they have other selections to choose from the menu.

I went to Port of Subs for breakfast thinking it would be a good meal. First of all, their eggs are heavily manufactured. They put their "yoke" in a microwave and surprisingly something that looks like eggs came out. They barely put any lettuce on my sandwich  and the cheddar cheese didn't taste too much like cheddar. The service wasn't all that great either.

The salads are always hand-tossed and fresh. Unlike other Sweet Tomato's, they don't charge you extra for premium toppings. The soups are always tasty as is the pizza and pasta. The service is always friendly here. You pay a little more than other buffet's, but you get great quality of food and get to each much healthier.

I have used Southwest more than any other airline. I cannot think of one trip on this airline that would make me think twice of flying on it. Excellent service, low cost, and a comfortable ride to my destination.

I've been to so many games here. A lot of great memories here!  I would have to agree with the notion that it is one of the most fan-friendly ballparks. They have a very large kid's clubhouse, a ballpark staff who greets you and always has a smile on their face, and they now have a fitness center inside the ballpark! The ticket costs are still among the lowest in MLB baseball, which is surprising taken that their utuilty bill must be through the roof! (No pun intended)   My only criticism is the food situation. I enjoy the fact they allow you to bring food inside the ballpark. That being said, I had trouble even getting a very small cup of water for free. They have a Subway and Panda Express inside the park (which I like because it provides a healthier alternative), but the prices are unbelievably high. You can't even order what you want at at Subway! Some of the food service staff fan be rude.   Aside from that, Chase Field is a great venue to being your family and/or friends to watch a baseball game. Maybe once in my life I'll be able to watch s game at the park's swimming pool

Very good quality food and service. It is a great place to bring family and friends. Chips and salsa are fresh and the combination plates are always filling.

The breakfast food is delicious! I've only been a few times, but every time I left full and satisfied. The atmosphere is very welcoming, and the service was very good. I recommend trying their Protein Pancakes or their Idaho Hot Skillets!

My experience with Dr. Evangelista has been great. I had surgery on my right knee which he performed the operation. Not only was the surgery a success, he wanted to see me often (most of the visits post-op were free of charge) to check on my progress and tell me what I need to work on at P.T. to get better. Sure enough, he wants you to get back to 100%. When talking to him, I do feel like he cares. He just has a different way of expressing it, which is why I think the other reviewers felt like he didn't care.
