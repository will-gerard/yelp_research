Recommendation:  Skip to dessert.  Get the brownie sundae!  It is massive and can be shared if you really have too.    The wait can be long when there are multiple  events going on downtown.  Get here two hours before your event and you should be fine.  Food is pretty good.  The menu has a nice variety of choices from appetizers to salads to soups to BBQ to sandwiches and much more.  Since it is a large place the noise level does get high when crowded.

The concerts are always outstanding.  This is a great ensemble with a variety of musical offerings and conductors.  I always enjoy myself and have a great time.  No seat is a bad seat.

I love this place and my kids love this place.  We have been members for years.  The best part is this membership gets us into other museums throughout the US for free or for a big discount.

My rating is based on only the Monterey Melt!  It is the only burger that I crave on occasion.  2 large beef patties, 2 different cheeses, special sauce, grilled onions, poblano and red bell pepper.  Delish!  I love you baby.

I just moved to the area and needed a new dentist.  I picked Baseline Dental / Dr. Chris Payne because they took my insurance and they are close.  Reading some of the reviews I read we're great and others were not but I decided to try Baseline and form my own opinion.  I found the Baseline team (including Dr. Payne) to be very warm, friendly and professional.    I highly recommend them to everyone based on my very positive experience.

I have been a patient here for about 2 years.  Dr. Payne and his team are top notch.  The quality of service is great as well as the customer service.  I have never had any issues with them and highly recommend them.

I have heard many good things about this place and then saw mixed reviews on Yelp.  Bill Clinton even ate here.  (I don't think George Washington slept here!  You east coasters will get the joke.)  My overall opinion is that Poncho's is a run of the mill Mexican restaurant.  - my server was very nice and attentive (except for refilling my water) but the kitchen was very slow  - the chips were fresh but still very greasy  - the Pollo Fundido, one of their signature entrees was a good sized but soggy chimichanga with lots of moist chicken stuffed inside it.  It was then drowned in a white cream cheese jalape√±o sauce.  All very salty to me.  - I ordered rice and beans that we're okay at best.  I know they are refried beans but these were also greasy.  Bottom line - with over 20+ Mexican restaurants within a few miles of here I will continue trying new ones vs returning here.  Sorry Poncho's!

Some co-workers brought me here for lunch and I enjoyed it very much. The service was good and the food was even better!  They have a variety of hot lunch specials in addition to a wide variety of sushi and rolls.  I tried a few different tempura roles and loved them.

Saturday morning 7:10a.  Just dropped my car off across the street for an oil change and used Yelp to locate Nosh.    Walked right in, went up to the counter to order a build your own Frittata and coffee.  The gal at the counter was very nice and full of energy.  The wait time for my food was acceptable.  My Frittata was good/delish too.  It was delivered hot, tasty and fluffy.  Served with hash browns that were good but average.  I would return.

Nice, older resort.  The grounds are beautiful.  Great location near Arizona Mills Mall and about 15 minutes from Sky Harbor Airport.   If you are visiting the area on vacation and plan to explore the area, this is a good home base since it is easy access to several highways.

I like It here and have been here before but this visit was a bit upsetting.  Yes, it is Easter Sunday at 5:30p and it was so crowded earlier we left and came back after shopping.  The men's room was FILTHY and looked like it hadn't been serviced all day.  The dining room floor was also dirty - nothing that a broom could clean up with minimal effort.  The kitchen was also slow today.  I expect more from a large chain like this.

Very disappointing experience.   -Moved through ER in a timely fashion. -Ran the same scan/test that I had an hour earlier at a radiology center.  I even provided them a disc with the results. -The staff over promised and under delivered many times. -The doctor didn't even review the scan/test results before seeing me. -The doctor royally screwed up the prescriptions and didn't call them into the pharmacy as promised. Bottom line:   I wouldn't return to this location!

Yeah baby!  I love AJ's.  Hugh fresh fruit and vegetable section.  Large seafood and meat department with a variety of "raw" items and a variety of fresh pre-made options like chick cordon bleu that you can take home, heat and eat.  They have a good selection of wine, a sushi bar and a kitchen offering an array of hot items available for immediate consumption.  OH!!!!  I can't forget the bakery and coffee bar!  What are you waiting for?  Go inside!

Me (thought):  1. Tell me up front.   2.  Send someone to the store to buy Rediwhip!  $5.95?  Really?  Are we in Los Angeles at these prices?

I have been to several of their locations in and out of Arizona.  One is as good as the next Grimaldi's.  They all take me back to my days in NYC!   A good place to go!  I have found they have good food and good service.  This seems to be consistent from visit to visit.    I would recommend that you give this place a try because I think you will enjoy it.  When you go in - tell them that Chris from Yelp recommended you go there.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but it might provide some interesting entertainment and a good laugh or two!  Enjoy!

Wow!   A lot can change in a year, and not for the good!    I used to think this place was decent, but no longer.  The sweet and sour chicken was anything but.  The 1/8 of chili pepper flake made the dark brown sauce spicy as h*ll.  The fried rice was disappointingly bland.  The egg roll was ok tasting but greasy.  I am not sure what happened to this place.

We love watching Diamondbacks games here.  The facility has a roof that closes so on hot summer days the stadium can be air conditioned.  All seats have a good view and the tickets range from affordable for a family to the mid one hundred range.  They also have a value menu if you are right on money or a starving student.

Looks like a great place, and probably is for hanging out and having some drinks with friends.  For lunch or dinner - I would pass!  The positives:  Good drinks/cocktails. The negatives: Kids eat free every day however the waitress tried to charged us for two kids meals.  My son's milk was sour.  The cheese on the nachos was poured (cheese sauce) on instead of melted on.  The plate was super hot when the waitress put it in front of him.  The rice and beans tasted like they came from a can......I think you get the point.

Disappointing compared to Thai Elephant which is about a mile away.  I was disappointed with the Chicken Peanut Curry.  It was like getting a bowl of bland peanut soup with chicken and dry vegetables in it.     The spring role was good that came with the lunch entree.

I love this place and so do my kids!  Tonight I went for fishing gear for the kids.  This is an area I know nothing about.  Brad in the fishing department was very friendly and very helpful.  He spent a good 10-15 minutes with me helping me to pick out the right trout fishing equipment.   Thanks Brad!  This place caters to kids with activities for them on Tuesday nights and occasionally on weekends.  Check out their website.

My review:  Please understand that I am a hard rater.  I rarely award more than 3 stars.  My definition of 3 stars is a good, solid meal with good service.   The food here was just okay and the prices are high.  The staff was friendly and attentive however my entree arrived 1 minute after my soup arrived.  Poor planning on my servers part.  Tonight I had the three enchilada plate and corn with chorizo soup.  I am not a fan!  I haven't been here in several years.  Now I remember why.

Here over 30 minutes for lunch and still no food.  I came in and it was half full.  Now it is full.  I ordered coconut soup and chicken curry.  I specifically requested the soup first.  Everything came out together.  In my book this place is a disappointment based on service alone.  The coconut soup was bland. The chicken curry was supposed to be mild and is spicy, with a unique flavor unlike most other Thai restaurants.  Personally,  there are many other Thai places that I would go to.

People from my office love this place so I decided to bypass the BIG "S" and go to Dutch Bros.  I am so glad that I did.  I ordered a hot Cocomo (chocolate and coconut) and loved it.  I highly recommend giving Dutch Bros Coffee a try.  The second good thing about my experience is that the gal that took my order was very, very nice and friendly (and flirty).  I understand that this is the case at all of their locations.  Great customer service.

I was disappointed!  Service was slow for this dinner visit.  Ordered a steak cooked medium well.  It came out medium rare.  Steak came with two sides.  I ordered corn on the cob and mac and cheese.  The waitress later informed me they were out of mac and cheese.  She suggested french fries which I got.  They were overly salted.  When reviewing the bill I was charged $1.50 for each side order.  The waitress removed these charges at my request since the sides are included in the price of the steak.  The patio is nice and I might consider trying breakfast here but wont be back for dinner.

Steamed dumplings were large, homemade but refrigerator cold inside.  Not pork filled like typically found.  Brown discoloration.  Noodles with crab and shrimp - homemade noodles all stuck together.  My guess is covered with store bought Alfredo sauce.  I will not return.

2 times here in 2 weeks.  Lots of fun last week.  Great comics, great service (Chris was my server) and great drinks.  Tonight I am having dinner here.  They just changed food providers to Sugar Rae's.  I have no info on this company but we'll see!  They have a larger selection of BBQ.  They also offer 3 salads and 3 flatbread options.  They have a variety of typical BBQ joint sides:  baked beans, Mac & cheese, cole slaw......  I ordered the 3 meat plate with pork, brisket and a hot link.  My sides are baked beans and Mac & cheese.  Food is good.  Chris was my server again so service was also good!

I have been to Stand Up Scottsdale many, many times.  The comics here are always funny with a variety of entertainment styles.  The owner, Howard Hughes even has a stand up routine that entertains the crowd!  The food is from Sugar Rae's BBQ kitchen.  While they offer more than just BBQ I have to admit that I always seem to gravitate towards the BBQ because it is tasty.  The drinks are good and at an affordable price.  The staff is attentive and provides good service.  I recommend you stop in for a show and be prepared to laugh your ass off!

I had an appointment at 4:30p.  I arrived at 4:25p to find about 20 people in the waiting area.  There were a few others in front of me at the check-in desk but I still only had to wait about a minute to be helped.  By 4:30p I was in the back getting my test done.  Friendly - yes Efficient - yes Positive experience -yes  Note:  they allow walk-ins for X-rays and possibly other tests so that may be the cause of several poor reviews.

I hired Wave because of the # of stars by Yelp users.  Unfortunately, I am disappointed with the service they performed at my home.  Communication was good before the actual appointment.  They even texted me to ask if their maids could arrive an hour early.    I was home working when they arrived and on conference calls and web meetings most of the time they were here.  They cleaned each room, the interior windows and wet washed my blinds.  When finished one of their maids yelled upstairs, "We are leaving."  I went downstairs and she asked if I wanted to check their work. Because I was on a call I declined since I trusted they did quality work.   Once my meeting ended I walked around and was disappointed at some of the things I found.  Streaky mirrors Dust balls in my closet Dusty furniture Bugs still in corners and carpet edges Dirt streaks Did not dust air vents  Apparently their "deep" cleaning means they do not move anything when dusting, don't use the hand tools on their vacuum or take pride in their work.  So, I can only give them 2 stars and do not recommend their service.

First and last time here.  We were not greeted by our waitress for at least 10 minutes after sitting down.  Service went down hill from there.  One order came out wrong.  Chicken on nachos was dried out.  Nachos were below average.  Waitress disappeared for almost our entire visit.  There is a short hair blonde female manager that walks around the place but never talks to customers.  She walks and walks and walks.     Music was way too loud. It made it hard to have a conversation.  For me, this was a hugh disappointment.

By far the BEST bagels in the area.  The owner is a native NY (actually NJ).  He flies in his crumb cake in from a NJ bakery - it is Delish.   Great breakfast choices and sandwiches for lunch.  Worth the short wait in line.  Update on 8/30/15:  still delish!  I am getting a little frustrated that during my last three visits I have had issues with my order being correct.  I had them at 5 stars but took one away.

Ordered 40 minutes ago and still waiting........ I ordered the Irish Eggs Benedict which is made with corned beef hash and comes with home fries.  Also have my two kids with me and they are starving and now restless.  Update:  food finally arrived!  Average at best in flavor.  Undercooked and runny poached eggs.  Pineapple slice on Mickey Mouse pancakes was old and tangy in an expired way.  When you go in - tell them that Chris from Yelp recommended you go there.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but it might provide some interesting entertainment and a good laugh or two!  Enjoy!

Dr. Dungy is fantastic.  I am seeing him for issues with both of my knees.  All of my interactions have been A+.  I highly recommend him and his staff as did my prior Orthopedic doctor.  My only issue is the wait times.  My past few appointments have been delayed by 30-45 minutes which makes it hard when you have to get back to the office for work.  But - I never feel rushed when they are with me.

Excellent.  Sweet and Sour chicken was fantastic.  Pad Thai very good.  Roast pork fried rice was outstanding.  Very, very friendly staff and great service.  Don't let the outside fool you!  It is worth a try.

As an Emerald Club - Executive member I travel a lot.  The Las Vegas location is great.  Great selection of vehicles &  good customer service.

The kids love it and that is all that matters!  Tons of Butterflies and right next to OdySea Mirror Maze, which the kids like too.  It looks like they are also building an aquarium here too!  Right off the 101 and easy to get to.

A good place to go!  I have found they have good food and good service.  This seems to be consistent from visit to visit.  They have great tasting hot dogs and brats with a wide variety of toppings all for about $6 to $7 per dog.  I would recommend that you give this place a try because I think you will enjoy it.  When you go in - tell them that Chris from Yelp recommended you go there.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but it might provide some interesting entertainment and a good laugh or two!  Enjoy!

Good donuts here.  They have breakfast and lunch sandwiches too.  Service is good.  Nice variety of donuts to choose from.  Big beverage selection as well, including coffee drinks, teas, juices, sodas and more.

While I respect other people's opinions I don't agree with some of the other reviews.  I base my review on over 12 visits to him over a 20 month month period AND after 2 knee surgeries.  (Yes!  My body is a mess! ).    Dr. Farber is outstanding doctor with great technical skills and a strong reputation in the medical community.  He has always been warm, friendly, caring and very professional.  His office staff is also top notch.  I would recommend Dr. Farber without hesitation.

Yes!  Yes!  Yes!   I gave them 5 stars!  That rarely happens!  Ok, here is the scoop ---  Other reviewers might complain about the wait -  I got there at 10:45a and was 10th in line.  They opened promptly at 11a.  I ordered my food at 11:10am.  This is consistent with the 1 to 1-1.5 minute wait per person.  It was 104 and sunny today and I am sooooo happy that I waited.   I had a 2 meat platter with brisket and ribs.  I selected grits and slaw for my sides.  --- DELISH!  I also tried the sausage and shredded pork.  Both outstanding!  To top it all of I tried the pecan pie.  Fantastic!!!!  1/27/2016 - now a regular visitor!  Still a wait and still worth the wait!  Worth the wait!!!!!

I enjoyed my visit here and I was happy to see they are part of Yelp Check-In For Children.  The food, service and atmosphere were all very good.  The menu had a lot of variety and the prices are affordable.    If you are looking for a good breakfast place then I suggest Scramble.   I suggest the French Toast!

Airport location is not as good as the location downtown.    They get really busy here and often have a 15-20+ minute wait.  From this experience I will not return to the airport location again.

Had breakfast this morning and was very disappointed.  I am a big fan of Guy Fieri's and went out of my way (passing 50+ other competitors to visit his new Vegas restaurant.  The food was very tasty and the portions were good however the service was not what I expected from one of his restaurants and that alone took away from our overall experience!  Hostess experience was average.  Seated immediately outside.  Waited 14 minutes for waiter to approach me.  No hello, no welcome to our restaurant!  "Have you decided?" is all I got.  Another 17 minutes go by and the food finally arrives luke warm.  Normally this wait might not seem like much but most other tables already had their food so the kitchen couldn't have been "slammed".  No refill on water.  Done eating.  Waited more than 15 minutes for waiter to return so I could get the check.  Tons of dirty tables with nobody cleaning off the dirty dishes.    Note to waiter:  Pull up your pants Sai!  Nobody wants to see your boxers!  This shows that no matter how good the food - bad service takes the cake and leaves a lasting impression.  Sorry Guy!  I am still a big fan though and I will continue my journey to your other eating establishments.

What a cool place this is and what a great event Lindsey and YELP hosted.  Thank you.  The night started by going to see a "secret" movie who's name we didn't find out until it began (Raising Arizona), eating a great tasting Brat from The Short Leash Dog Food Truck and having my first drink from the bar compliments of YELP.  Oh, I can't forget the goodie back filled with cool stuff too!  Very cool theatre, good projection, good sound, comfortable seats and a great group of YELPERS!  All this made for a great event!  Thanks

I only got ice cream but it is the same quality as other Dairy Queen locations.    This location has burgers, hot dogs, chicken, fries and much much more.  $5 lunches are a popular hit.  Eat in or take out.  This location has a really nice outdoor seating are too.

People love this place.  I am just not a fan of their pizza.  Then again, I am an ex-New Yorker!

Decor - 5 star  Service - 2 star (Waiter was friendly but looked like he never combed his bedhead hair.  He also looked and sounded stoned.  Food - a big disappointment!  Eggs Benedict were supposed to come on a LGO English muffin.  NOT!  It wasn't even a Thomas' English muffin.  Portion size was small and the chorizo tasted like the kind you squeeze out of a pouch.  Both my friend and I were really disappointed with our experience here.

First time here! Since it is Sunday the appetizers are all 50% off. We ordered:  guacamole, wings, ceviche, street corn queso and the brussels sprout nachos.  - All delish!  Wow!  As Arnold said - I'll be back!

This Ross store always looks like a tornado hit it.  Beside low stock there are always items all over the floor. I never see staff picking things up to rehang them.  I would suggest going to another Ross location.

This was my first time here.  I have been to other comedy clubs in town and this one is roomy with good service.  The line up I saw was good, including the MC.  I will return.

Harry Basil,  Eleanor Kerrigan and ANDREW DICE CLAY  I have been to  Scottsdale Laugh Factory before and wrote a good review.  Tonight was such a bad experience that I am changing my review.  The show began at 8pm.  By 9pm (after the two opening acts) no waitress had even approached us to take a drink order.  We were finally able to flag the waitress down to take our order just as ADC is taking the stage.  At the time of placing the order she also took my credit card.  9:35p no waitress, no food or drinks.    At 9:45pm  the waitress is dropping of checks to other tables near us.  I asked for my credit card back.  She told me she still needed to get our bill.  I reminded her that she never brought us anything that we ordered!  This whole situation ruined the entire evening.  Kerrigan and CLAY were good.

I love WinCo and wish there was one closer to Arizona Mills Mall.  Great selection and quality.  Like Costco but you can buy a lot more and smaller portions. Check your prices - they aren't always cheaper.

I went for the poutine (fried, gravy and cheese curds)  but was disappointed.  Prices were also on the high side in my opinion.

Being from Tucson I was happy to see this location open in Phoenix.  I am a big fan.  The owner even came to our table to see how we were enjoying our meals.  Go with the hot dogs!

Beware!  Do your homework first.  I emailed this location requesting prices and obtained them in writing a week ago.  I dropped off my car and later got a call with different/higher prices being quoted.  These prices did not reflect the sale prices listed on the Fletcher's website.   It took some doing but I was able to negotiate better pricing than quoted saving a few hundred dollars.  Price compare first!  Get it in writing. Negotiate!  Not sure that I will return here.
