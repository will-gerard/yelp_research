I'm glad that great customer service can still be experienced at a Nordstrom. Sadly, this one is about 800 miles away from where I live.  I expected the Scottsdale Nordstrom to be as or more upity than my neighboorhood Cherry Creek spot, but was plensantly surprised. The customer service was great, and when my helper had to transfer to a another customer that arrived before me, he made sure that I was covered by someone else. Nice.  When I go to Nordstrom, I don't expect great prices, but do expect good quality and great customer service. The Scottsdale employees got it right.

When I order Taco Bell, I expect a little bit of disgusting and a lot of gross. But, this Taco Bell (also a KFC) was a little beyond gross. My order was leaking grease, so much so that the plastic bag that hid that goodness was also caving under the weight of the grease.  My Taco Bell experience in Arizona. Not good.

Ahhh, animal style fries. How I've missed you so.  This wasn't the best In-N-Out Burger I've been to, mainly because of the lack of cleaniness of the seating and flooring, but it was still pretty damn good. Keep in mind the secret menu to make your order unique and the envy of the person behind you.  I arrived at 11 PM, which was perfect since there wasn't a line in site. The next day, I arrived at lunch and was overwhelmed with mobs of hormone-induced teenagers waiting to devour every cow and potato in sight. So, make sure you arrive a little early or a little later for meal times. Regardless, it is well worth the wait.

I happened about this little gem during a recent Google search and boy, was I happy to find it!  My lady and I had an awesome guide (Ken) who was not bias to our city slicker attire and my inability to make my house go any faster than a slow crawl. We took the two hour ride up a cliff & a mountain with excellent views of Saguaro Lake. We even learned a little bit about the local flora, mainly painfully sharp catci and fauna, a dead pig. It may not sound exciting, but it actually was.  If you are looking for a good time in the desert for a bit of cash and like horses, than this is the place to go. Judgments will not be cast no matter what type of designer jeans you are wearing.

I must admit, I did think places that only sold cupcakes were pretty ridiculous. I mean, come on! There are more desserts out there, like pecan pie! But, my lady told me to suck it up and we ventured in. It's actually a pretty cool place, with a huge selection of cupcakes to choose from. There is even a gluten free option (red velvet)!  If you can figure out what the "whisper" word of the day is, you'll get a free cupcake. I was lucky enough to be in line behind someone who had the hookup, shared the word, and filled my stomach with an extra helping of frosting goodness.  As I exited my first cupcake experience, I heard about all the fundraisers that Sprinkles does, which immediately makes me feel a lot better to spend $3.50 on a round piece of cake. Now, I just need to find an IV form of their carrot cake frosting and I'll be a happy camper!

Fresh fruit, delicious yogurt and cookie dough. That's right, COOKIE DOUGH! All of this and it won't do too much damage to the ol' waistline. Well, besides the pound of cookie dough I fit into my cup.  If you haven't been to Yogurtland, you must go right now. What are you reading this review for and go NOW! There are at least ten different flavors and about 50 topping choices. The best part is the price, which ends up being by the ounce (34 cents last time I went), so it's a decent price for a healthy lunch or a trashy dessert.   I ate here for lunch three days in a row and I usually can't go a lunch without some sort of meat product. That should tell you something. It's delicious, self-serve and customizable. Go there now!

Another great Starbucks! Man, I'm beginning to think that Starbucks might be a successful company. Weird.  My favorite part about this one is it's located in one of those great southwestern-style strip malls that you see all over Arizona. And with that comes those wispy little trees, cactus, sand and sandstone.   To sum up, order your favorite coffee, enjoy the lovely mid-October through mid-March beautiful Arizona weather, and relax!

I'm sad to report that Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers is the only thing that this restaurant serves. The food was acceptable, however perhaps they should consider adding "Service" and "Friendliness" and "Great Prices" to the name, making it a little more true and holding their staff accountable.  There is a nice little outdoor seating area, however since you are in Arizona, if it is below 70 degrees, they'll put the heater on. So don't sit outside in those conditions if you are from any non-Arizona state or not from the planet Mercury.   There are better places for cold beers and cheeseburgers, so make sure you give them a try before entering this below average establishment.

For all the things that the PHX airport doesn't have (style, walk-ability, comfort, etc), it always surprises me with little gems like this hidden down it's brown, dark and depressing corridors.   Cartel offers an alternative to Starbucks in a friendly and comforting package. Prices are about the same but the taste of the drink is just different enough to make you think you have found a whole new gold mine just waiting for the picking.  Next time you are awaiting your Southwest flight, make sure you visit Cartel for a refreshing beverage. All of this can be had before fighting with your fellow air travelers over spot A45.

This hotel is an EXCELLENT alternative for someone who wants to be away from it all while still being within 10 minutes of everything you need. For example, this hotel is built in what will inevitably be a well developed area. However, right now, every piece of land is open (which the exception of the casino/hotel next door) and you can see for miles. I like that. In this day and age, space is hard to find. For $109/night ($89/night on the weekends) you can find it.  As for the room itself, they are standard Hampton fare, which is to say excellent for a so-called value hotel. Don't expect the W, but do expect clean and up-to-date rooms. Beds are very comfortable, but the duvet covers are a little short (I like to snuggle up). Air conditioning works like a champ. The morning breakfast is nothing to be extremely happy about, but it did it's job. WIFI is free too, another rare occurrence.   Beware of flooding at this location. During my stay, AZ decided to do an impression of OR and rain the entire weekend. Those parked in the back parking lot were lucky to get their cars back without flooding, with the sacrifice of soaked shoes and socks. Minor problem, as the parking lot is huge and the hotel is yet to be discovered.

I should mention that I didn't actually do any golfing activities because it was 110 degrees and golf is lame, but I was there to supervise a graduation party for little kids while drinking several beers and eating delicious chips, salsa and guac.  This place is HUGE. There is a main bar where you can watch all the sports your heart desires, or watch people walk in with khakis and square shaped polos with checkmarks on them. Either way you'll enjoy yourself.  The best part about this place is the fact that there are rooms everywhere for entertainment, including Xbox on massive TV's. If you get tired of one area, you are going to find another comfortable place.  Great for kids, great for adults looking to pretend to be pro golfers, and great for happy hours. I kind of like this place!
