This walmart was really icky. And it made me go bazerk! There were zero cashiers and 50 people trying to buy their products. I had to wait in line for over 30 minutes just to buy my tampons.

I love Mario's. Best pizza in the surprise area. Also great ranch. But sometimes their chicken wing sauce gives me the trots. Go Mario.
