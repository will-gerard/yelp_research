Ok, I gave this place THREE chances.  I am not very judgemental on restaurants because I am a former server and I tend to look on the bright side.  However, I HAVE to comment on this place.  The first time I went, it was for the Bears game.  They had just opened and hadn't even had their "grand opening".  Service sucked, but we gave them the benifit of the doubt because they JUST opened.    Second time I went was after a Cubs spring training game where they were being advertised a lot.  We actually had to ask the manager for service.  Then we were not taken care of at all after that, probably because she was embarased.   Third and final time was for a final four March Madness game.  Once again we had to ask the manager for service!!   Each time I was there we waited at least 20-30 minutes before someone served us, and that was only because we asked.  Then once we were served, the service sucked!!  Each time I was there, it wasn't very crowded, yet the service was so slow!    The food wasn't very good because it was sitting at the window so long, it was turning cold.  To top it off...the waitress got my brother to order a big brownie thing with ice cream and the brownie was cold!!!   Nice try Cactus Moon...you could have been a great place to watch games, but you loose!!!  Train your waiters/waitresses better PLEASE!!

Amazing!! I bought their groupon for the 2.5 hour facial and message. I called and they were able to get me an apt right way. I love how their place is set up. The front desk is separate from the waiting room. Once you enter the waiting room, you feel the relaxation set in. Mikki did my facial and used all natural products which I appreciate since that's what I use at home. Jonathan did my message and he is very intuitive! He was aware of what my body was telling him and he responded. He used pressure points and suggested foods to help my ailments. I will definitely be going back! Thanks guys!!
