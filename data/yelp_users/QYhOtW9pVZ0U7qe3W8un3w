I have a short haired dachshund and I wanted to get him groomed so I took him to Shelly's!  It was an obvious choice for me because my mother has been taking her Golden's there for 10+ years every two weeks, so I knew I would receive excellent service!   Marcus does not play well with other dogs, but Shelly's handles him well while in the company of other dogs.  I feel that $25 is an AWESOME price and well worth every penny, at this price I think Marcus will visit Shelly's often!

I had been CRAVING a Really Good Croissant for a long time!  I used to go to P.croissants back in the 80's/90's and I am sure they were owned by someone different then and the Croissants were AMAZING!  Then I went to day and more then likely will never go back!  I just got a Plain Croissant and brought it home and I was SO DISAPPOINTED!  It was not flaky at all and very LITTLE taste.  Not at all like I had remembered them to be.  As a side note if anyone is looking for the best Croissant's, HANDS DOWN, Williams and Sonoma!  You get them via mail order and they come frozen, set them out the night before and bake them and they are AMAZING, my holiday treat every year now.  Keeping a box around all year is dangerous!  I have found nothing to compare to them and looks like I will stick to them!

This was my first time to Olive and Ivy, I am a BIG fan of Fox Restaurants so I was excited to come here.  We went on a Friday night about 6pm and we got a table with no wait!  They brought out some AWESOME Bread with an incredible Pesto Sauce, Yummy!  I ordered the beet salad with arugula, goat cheese & pistachio.  I was NOT disappointed, highly recommend!  This was my dinner, I think I had to much popcorn at the movie before. :)  Between the salad and bread I was satisfied and not to full for desert!  We shared a desert, Apple Tart, Very Good!  My mother had the Mediterranean Salad and a Friend had the Lasagna and both said their dishes were good.  Service:  Our server was very attentive!  The only reason I did not give Olive and Ivy 5 Stars was because it was too noisy in the restaurant.  I have noticed more and more restaurants are going for the cement floors that lend to a nosier atmosphere.

Based on all of your reviews I went on a wimb last Sunday and I got a same day appointment with Mary and she was AWESOME!!!  WOW!  I went with a sore lower back and sore legs from a hike I did the day before.  I left and my lower back was no longer sore AT ALL!   I was surprised how much they worked on your upper body front and back, pleasantly surprised!   I just thought they worked on your feet. I do have to agree about the noise from other rooms, but I felt so good the other noise did not bother me to much! I will be going back and definitely asking for Mary!
