great vibe here!  Food: 4 stars Service: 4 stars  Lychee martini to start off our night-- good choice! refreshing and strong martini, good amount of sweet.  We got some sashimi, a chicken lettuce wrap (so good) and a roll (alaskan?). Bf also got a miso soup. I didn't note down the prices since I wasn't the one paying :P but everything was well done. Chicken lettuce wrap had hot filling fresh off the wok and not too salty at all. Sashimi came in large, juicy and fresh pieces, I was definitely satisfied. The roll was mediocre but put together pretty well. Finished dinner with a mochi dessert. The fresh fruits were great, mochi ice cream was just ok. Overall, I say this is one of the best 'expensive-chinese' foods in vegas.

Food: 2 stars Service: 3 stars  Coffee was $2.5 and mediocre. Euro crepes were thick and bland. Bacon was over-fried IMO. All that was good was company and ambience. Wouldn't come back unless I had to. If I did come back I'd get some pancakes instead!  The summer hours are 7am-2pm.

From the looks of yelpers photos, some people had bad luck and got some really bad pizza, but from the attitude of this place, I would not be afraid to send it back to the kitchen and let them know about any soggy crust because it appears the kitchen WANTS to serve delicious pizza. Very attentive and patient servers even amid all the chaos of people coming and leaving and ordering to-go.  With that said, I was lucky to get a perfectly cooked magherita pizza ($10.95), lots of mozzarella toppings and some basil, the crust was thin, crunchy and chewy at the same time and STILL good the next day (for breakfast I heated it up in the microwave and finished it in the oven, for lunch i had the last slice cold, still. so. good.)  It's 4 stars only because it's on the pricey side, but otherwise I had a very satisfying pizza. Trying the chicken parmesan next time like the server enthusiastically suggested :)
