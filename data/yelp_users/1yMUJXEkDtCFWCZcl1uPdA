I absolutely love chipotle, and eat there all the time. Unfortunately every chipotle is different and this location I went to was not one of my best. My friend and I grabbed dinner there two nights ago. After a couple hours of studying, we were starving and decided to get chipotle. I regret that decision because they were so stingy it was ridiculous! I was not in the mood for rice or beans so I just got a chicken bowl, and without the extra stuff in your bowl you can definitely tell how much they really skimp you on the meat. Then I got to the guac, barely even half a scoop.... all for 10 bucks.

So good! When I first heard of this place, I was skeptical. Maybe because of the name or how people would describe it to me as, "a really good hot pocket." So I finally went the other day, and it was delicious!! I got the Mexican, and I loved it!!!

I went once because I live real close, and wanted mexican food. Unfortunately, I will not be going back because it was not good. I got a burrito and it was doused in oil, it was just terrible. I did not even finish it, because it was causing an upset stomach. Maybe I just chose the wrong dish, but that dish caused me to not wanna go back.
