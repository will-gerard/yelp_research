One star for the unbelievable wine selection. There is something on the bottle list for everyone. If you do not find what you want, the staff is more than happy to make recommendations based on your preference.   One star for the past experiences that I have had at this establishment. It is a wonderful place to take a date or a client on a slow night. I have had impeccable service in the past.  My second to latest trip was sub-standard. I decided to give it a go with a group of friends for a special event and, again, very dissatisfied. I am not sure what happened but, I will never choose to go here with others unless they absolutely have the need.

Because there was no option for zero stars. By far the worst dining experience I have ever had, hands down. I was embarrassed that I suggested that my colleague and I meet at this location for lunch. The food was okay but the service is what really killed the entire experience for us both. While waiting for my colleague, I was asked several times if I was okay and if I needed an appetizer. I feel that I made it pretty clear that I was going to wait for the other member of the party. The waitress continued to visit and ask if I was okay, which was fine, it was not annoying yet.   When we did finally order she told the other member of the party that they could not prepare his meal that way, that she would check but knew they would say no. Wow! Really? Any server would tell the guest that they would check and leave it at that. Now comes the kicker, we were asked if we wanted dessert while still in the middle of our meal. No joke. I can't make this stuff up. I don't know why I keep going back to this place to give it another chance. On top of that, after discussing with the manager, she said that they hope to make it better when I return. I will never be back to this location unless there is another tenant in that space.

For those that don't know my eating habits, I tend to stick to the things that I like. I find something and I end up pretty much sticking to it. First Watch is another one of those restaurants that has helped me to "branch out". I try to eat healthy for the most part and stick to their healthier part of the menu and have tried just about everything in that section and have not been disappointed. The Tri-Athlete Omelette and the Power Wrap are my favorite. Just the right amount of food to fill me up and get me going for the day.   I also enjoy the Lean Machine but, have heard some negative feedback about the "bland" turkey patty so be aware. My thought is that it is supposed to be healthy so I don't expect too terribly much from the patty of turkey. Especially since the rest of the meal is so perfect.   The service has always been great and the food has always come out rather speedily. One time the food came out in less than five minutes! After speaking with the owner, he let me know that they try to get the food out in under a certain amount of time. He stated the faster they get it out, they can keep from getting backed up in the kitchen. Haste does not make waste in this case at all. I always leave satisfied and look forward to going there again.

Catch 22 is my local neighborhood sports bar, named for the process of starting the establishment, I overheard the owner say that he couldn't get one license without another requirement and the name was born.  The sports theme highlights players that donned the number 22 such as Roger Clemens, Emitt Smith, Eric Byrnes and more. You will find a number of their jerseys hung on the wall with the 22 big screen TVs. I believe they have expanded so there may be more now.  Anyhow, the service here has always been excellent for me no matter how busy it has been. The food here is decent. It is bar food so not too much to expect there but the selection is pretty good.  In all it is a great place to catch a game. If you are looking for a sports bar to watch the game in this area, I highly recommend this establishment.

I have driven by several times and was looking to get a bite to eat on my way home. Noticed the best of Phoenix signage not knowing what to expect. I took a look at the menu as I walked in and was intrigued. I must admit that I am a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to dining. Not feeling like branching out too much I picked the BLT. The service was super fast and the sandwich was fantastic! It was like euphoria for the mouth.   The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. Dining opportunities like this make me want to try new things. I am sincerely excited to go back, try something new and that I tried this place out.

I visited in the middle of the week to grab a quick bite with a friend. I had been before but never to eat, so I had no expectations for the food. Because it was slower this particular day, we received pretty prompt service. I have had a good time here in the past, have never been disappointed and must say that it is definitely a fun place to go. For these reasons, I started it out at three stars.  What put it over the top? The food. Not wanting it to sound like an insult, I refrained from telling the waitress that the grub was "not bad for bar food". As a matter of fact, I highly recommend the fish tacos. Amazing! Having visited the land of fish tacos, AKA Southern California, I developed an affinity towards this tasty delicacy. The rice was flavorful and not the speedy stuff that some Mexican joints serve. The black beans were surprisingly great as well.   It was an excellent treat to have such a great meal at a place that can easily be labeled as a trendy casual cantina. Of the ones that I have been to in the Phoenix metro area, the food here makes me a fan. Like the menu reads, they "just don't make money by selling beer and t-shirts". Try the food if you get a chance!

I first learned about Sole Sports when I was looking for local group runs. I purchased my first pair of "serious" running shoes from them. While I was there, they performed a gait analysis and put me into a pair of shoes that had been the second more comfortable pair that I have run in, before they introduced me to my new favorite pair. The staff are not just knowledgeable about shoes, most are seasoned runners and athletes. In addition to shoes, the staff knows a ton about nutrition, maintenance and injury prevention. They have group runs that leave the store that have helped me immensely with my long distance runs. Not only have they helped me with my purchases, they have had a large part to do with my training. The staff is always very friendly and they have some very informative clinics as well as an occasional weekend event. I can not think of enough ways to give back to these guys so I try to make all of my running gear purchases there. I owe a debt of gratitude to Lance the staff there... you know who you are. You all rock! See you at a race or the next group run.

I absolutely love this place. I joke around that it would make my Mother jealous if she knew how much I liked it. My Dad says the same thing. Growing up on Mexican food I can honestly tell you that the food tastes just like Mom and Nana used to make. I would try different places from time to time and felt like I was a bit of a critic holding them to the "food I grew up with standard". Little did I know how excellent Someburros is.   Tamales take an incredible amount of time to make and the ones here are pretty tasty and I have no idea how they do it. The chicken tacos are wonderful and even the corn tortilla that it is in reminds me of ovens full of tacos that Mom would feed us with. The red sauce on the enchiladas is excellent and tastes just like Nana's.  When a simple lunch triggers childhood memories, it's good enough to rave about in a review. This is not a corporate joint, so do not expect that. It is a family owned establishment that makes some pretty authentic Mexican food.   It is discouraging to see people compare this restaurant to a Rubios or Baja Fresh. The food is fast but it definitely does not taste like fast food and I seriously doubt they have horchata at either of those places. While it is as close to the real deal as I have tasted, it is just as good, if not better, than some of the sit down Mexican restaurants that I have been to.
