I have had so many problems with my 2003 Jetta, in return I've met a lot of mechanics that just try to screw me over but not at martins.  I loved the customer service at martins auto repair. Dave is wonderful and everyone is so friendly. They told me exactly what was wrong with my car and to bring it in again just to make sure it was handled correctly. I'll definitely make the drive from tempe to here.

I had a fantastic experience at Chapman Chevrolet. After months of car problems, I finally gave in and decided to buy a new car. I had no idea what I wanted to buy but luckily I had the help of two very knowledgeable and friendly automotive specialists, MARK PACE and ZENON JUSKO. They made me feel confident in my purchase and really worked around my needs and budget! Such a great experience, I would recommend shopping here for anyone looking for excellent customer service and a great deal.

I loved this place. The atmosphere was very chilled out and the service was fantastic. I ate a chicken portobello pasty under the recommendation of the service and it was to die for. I highly recommend this place.

Worst costumer service ever. Not only does this company sell low quality material, you have no idea what you are buying because you cannot try things on, if something is ripped the management will not exchange your item.   I tried to exchange gloves after opening them and seeing two very large holes, I tried to exchange the gloves at the nearest spirit store and was treated horribly.  The management was cold and condescending.  DO NOT SHOP AT SPIRIT.  All customer service phone numbers are atomized.  All store location numbers are fake.  I will never go back to this company. To think, they lost business over exchanging $10 gloves.

My daughter found him online, after reviewing yelp to find a good deal for fixing a very shattered screen on her Iphone. He was the best price online. We did have a problem finding him, and drove around the shopping area 4 times. We then just parked, got out of the car and walked the shopping center until we found the Water and Ice store that had posted sighs for " Apple repair." We were greeted with a very friendly man, and told to come back in 20 min. Upon return this shattered, worthless phone was brand new again for 1/3 of what Apple would have cost. Great guy, great service, and we will definitely go back, especially now that we know he is there.  '

I absolutely love this place. I have a 2003 Jetta, needless to say, I've had A LOT of problems. I've been to a lot of mechanics and I always feel like I'm getting screwed or the customer service is lacking. At royal car service, I feel like my car is in safe hands and a fair price. Amr and Audra are fantastic and really helped me out. I highly recommend this place to everyone.
