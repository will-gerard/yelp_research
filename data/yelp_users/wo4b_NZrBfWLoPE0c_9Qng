The price is right, the food is all excellent.  The Panko white fish is what I had today, and had the Chicken Terryaki bowl in the past.  The women who work here are so so sweet, they are always so sweet to my son, which is worth 2 stars to me.  Every time you leave, they thank you for your business, and that just makes the food you burp up taste even better.    Plus when you are done eating you can walk across the street to the library and get your learn on.  I think what you will gather by my reviews is I like simple places that are cheap.  I like the fou fou stuff on occasion as well, but I like working class type people to make me my food, because they usually do it with love and passion.   Unless you're talking about Filibertos, where I found a rusty staple in my food once.

Been there twice now.  Great servers and the owner is a sweetheart.  I ate the Pechuga Asada and a pupusa Locoye(sp?) this time.  The chicken was made right, great beans and rice, fresh avocado,  big portions and the salsa and chips are excellent.   I live two blocks from here and I need to wake the eff up and go here more.

Oh man, this is so good. But everything is full of lard.  I leave here every time with a huge stomach and go home and take a nap for a few hours afterwards.   But so so good.

This place has it going on.  A little pricey for a small portion.  But oh what a portion it is.   I have never been here when its not packed to the brim.   A little yuppy for my taste, but I like the same foods yuppies eat, so I have no choice.

One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to in Phoenix.  Everything I've ever had here was good, except the guacamole.  The guac is bland and uninspiring.

The only time I would ever even think of going to Bikini Lounge is on a Tuesday night, when Alex, Tararista, Matty P, or myself are playing music.  Cheap beer you can drink right out of the pitcher.  Its a place to go get shitty.  Who gives a crap that its mostly hipsters hanging out there.  The breed of hipster in Phoenix is much less worse than the hipsters you find in Chicago.  Also, they are coming and enjoying the awesome real music we are playing them, who cares if they smell.  They're more innocently doing the hipster thing, since its somewhat new here.  And thats just cute.   Hint for dudes:  tuck your shoelaces in or cut them off before you enter the bathroom because there is always at least an inch of pisswater on the bathroom floor.

Oh succulent pork torta, how I love thee. And how I especially love thee when I buy you from El Guero.

Overpriced, just mediocre Thai food.  If the plates were 7$ instead of 11$, they'd get 3 stars from me.  I feel like I've had the best of the best in Chicago and in San Francisco, and now I'm a spoiled jerk about Thai food, because I can be.   And this place is unfortunately on the lower rungs.  Too bad too, because its one of the only 3 Thai places in the area.

Ive been trying to quit drinking coffee since I moved here, but Conspire coffee keeps putting me back on the junk.  I think about it, and then I start itching, then the cold sweats, then I make the 5 minute drive and get a large Americano and then the cycle continues.  I've been off coffee 2 days now.  Lets see how long i can go.     Conspire is a much needed vestige for a "scene" downtown.  A nice place to meet up with folks, hang out and watch people be weird, or try to be weird and fail, or try to be normal, and end up being weirder than the ones that try to be weird.   Conspire has shown nothing but growth since they opened, and I'm sure we'll see nothing but more from them in the future, cuz they deserve it!

The bean and cheese burritos are made of crack.   I guess I like crack.

We are now closed, but thanks to the good folks of Phoenix for supporting us while we were open!

Oh god, what a frickin rip off for some really bland sushi.  The plum ice cream was excellent, but other than that, I will never return to this place.  Cant stand this type of "ambience" either.  Neon blue lights on brick is not my idea of a cool dining room.   Crappy techno in the background too.  Oof, screw this place.   If I'm paying 8 dollars a piece for 2 small pieces of sushi, they better blow my face off.   And they didnt even come close.  Two stars because the ice cream was awesome.

For shame.   For shame.   Ok, this review is not to talk about the food at La Condesa .  I am a huge huge fan of the food and service, and everything else about this place except one thing.  While eating with a friend from Tucson, he recognized the art on the walls as being the art of famous San Francisco artist Sylvia Ji.   So we called the owner over to ask about the artist.  She told us all the art was by Mexican artists Manuel Gilavalos y Garcia and Ricardo Ramirez.   These are obvious reproductions of a young artist who is currently very hot and exhibiting all over the world.   How has La Condesa gotten away from this for so long?        The owners probably have no idea, but this is some shameful shit, and as great of a reproduction as it looks and makes the little restaurant feel,  Sylvia should be notified and should cease and desist on these "artists".      Google Sylvia Ji  and check the La Condesa website and compare the art, and you'll see what Im talking about.   One of the paintings in there is an EXACT replica of one of her paintings.
