I absolutely love this salon.  Michelle P has been my Esthetician for over 3 years and my skin is FABULOUS!  She must be making me look younger because my age guesses are going down...yay!  Every girl loves that!  Taylor is my super duper hair stylist and always makes sure I am hip and fresh - I tell her to do what's in and will look awesome, 'cause I'm old like that. :)  Angie does my blow outs when Taylor isn't available and is also magnificent.  Brazilian blowouts a must here.  And, Taylor does my make up for special occasions or turns me into Gwen Stefani for Halloween.  GREAT staff...Elizabeth at the appointment and check in desk is awesome, love her too!  If you want clean salon, professional people who are genuine, caring and skilled beautification experts - this is your place!  I think Michelle is going through more training for a health and beauty from the inside out addition to their services -coming soon.  Adore!

Stay away from this crap service poor excuse for a hotel. Loyal for years then they put us in a $500/night room in the "new Julius Caesar palace" with hammering, drilling and construction happening all night. No Lie. And they want to refund the $35 Resort fee. Are you KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW????????  Never again.  Mandarin Oriental SAVES the day and is taking us at 6am!!! Now that's class. SUCK IT, Caesars. What ever happened to CUSTOMER SERVICE anyway??  UPDATE: My husband wrote them a letter when we got home. All we got was a defensive response defending themselves saying they have warned contractors and yada yada excuses. You are the WORST excuse of an establishment for customer service ever!! Who does that? Just admit you should not have opened that floor for paying customers when you did and say you're sorry. All we got is 'hope you give us another try'.  REALLY?? You haven't given us ONE reason to. Idiots. It's not like we were even looking for a "deal"-just a good experience. We were ready to pay for it too. Double IDIOTS. Take a lesson in service at The Mandarin Oriental.

Love this place and the history is fascinating! Highly recommend the tour!  Learning about the families that have lived in this house since its completion in 1892 by Dr Rosson was so interesting!  We went to the Holiday First Friday and it was fun to have dinner at Pizzeria Bianco in Heritage Square and enjoy the Christmas lights.  The staff was fun and full of factoids.  Rosson House is still on its original site on Block 14 of the original townsite of Phoenix, Arizona in the Stick-Eastlake Queen Anne Style of Victorian architecture, possibly designed by prominent San Francisco architect A.P. Petit. This block with its now protected buildings is all that is left of early downtown Phoenix - a case for holding on to our heritage!  Learn some Phoenix history and see this spectacular "mansion" that was restored in the 1970s after becoming a "rooming house" where 19 people lived!  http://www.azpbs.org/arizonastories/rosson.htm

Our favorite local wine bar hang out...especially when Dan Emrey plays!  I hold events here often as well and Laura is always so gracious in participating in any fundraisers or community awareness gatherings.  Their wine is affordable and if you don't know much about wine - they will teach you without being snobby.  We LOVE our Vino 100!

Food is always good... gluten free menu was fantastic addition.  Now have beers on tap, expanded the bar area with a couple huge tables ideal for those of us who like to meet new people in the neighborhood, and a fabulous new happy hour menu.  Service is outstanding at this location -bartenders are great!

Dr McKeen, Dr Jo Turner and Chiropractor Dr Ross are all AWESOME!  Dr McKeen CHANGED my life.  My previous physician kept wanting to prescribe more drugs to treat the symptoms and when I finally found this clinic and they discovered the CAUSES to my health issues, we treated it and my health has never been better and my quality of life has improved 100%. The entire staff is fabulous

UPDATE January 11, 2016:  InfusionSoft refunded my money and I was told by someone on Twitter @AskInfusionsoft  they "recognize our cancellation process needs improving" so hopefully they are working on their process and this will not continue to happen to others.     No services or system have been provided, they refuse to refund the $900 & they're telling me they've cancelled my account per my request and will keep my $900 and continue to charge me for the next 2 months.  When I decided to try this system, I had NO DEMO but was told there was no paperwork or agreements. NO TERMS OR CANCELLATION POLICIES WERE DISCLOSED. I gave my credit card # to get going & begin their mandatory "Kickstart" coaching costing $1500, not knowing I was under obligation of any kind if it wasn't the right system for me.  They charged $900 immediately.  Within 10 days of trouble setting up my account and an attempted "coaching" call -where she was in a call center atmosphere with people yelling and talking loudly in the background and I couldn't hear her speaking - while she was unaware of my business being in real estate and what kind of business I had.......I stopped the call within 5-10 min and told her that this was not what I expected.   I called and told the rep I didn't want to continue with this solution at this point. After over a week of calling and emailing, Blake finally called me. He said that the $1500 is NOT for coaching, it's an "onboarding fee" and nothing more. I asked what an "onboarding fee" is, and he said it's just a mutual agreement that we're working together - that's it.  It's not for the coaching.  It's for the Access to it - "like a gym membership -if you don't go to the gym you can't ask for your money back".  I told him that using his example, gym memberships have agreements that you sign acknowledging you understand the terms. I did not sign anything.  Their website explains how you are required to pay for MANDATORY KICKSTART SERVICES and outlines training and coaching that you receive for paying $1500.  No services or system have been provided and not only are they refusing to refund the $900 but they're telling me they've cancelled my account per my request and will keep my $900 and continue to charge me for the next 2 months.   I started doing internet search on them and found all of this: * http://barbaragiamanco.com/infusionsoft-clueless/  * http://barbaragiamanco.com/did-infusionsoft-make-it-right-you-decide/  * http://barbaragiamanco.com/just-cancel-my-account-part-1/  * http://www.complaintsboard.com/complaints/infusionsoft-gilbert-arizona-c199327.html  * http://infusionsoft.pissedconsumer.com/

Why do I love the M.O?  Let me count the ways....This is our Vegas home now.  We've been here multiple times in the past 1-2 years and they never disappoint.  We love to play in Vegas and enjoy the casinos which are a tiny walk out the front door of the Mandarin.  Then, we thoroughly appreciate a quiet, great night's peaceful sleep...without smoke wafting up from a casino on a "non smoking floor".  But, after multiple experiences staying here - my FAVORITE thing about the Mandarin is the impeccable 5 star service.  Don't get me wrong, because these rooms and suites are TOP NOTCH -clean, tech and very contemporary with all the shiny bells & whistles like the remote control panels for the windows and tv in the bathroom mirror where you can play the meditative sounds while you enjoy a salt bath.  You can typically find other classy rooms and suites, but what is a RARE FIND is service from staff that treat you with the utmost respect and like they actually CARE ABOUT YOU and care that you've selected their establishment to invest your entertainment dollars.  I've indulged in their spa -a relaxing, delightful experience and their salon where Marla & Jen did my hair and makeup for NYE -making me the belle of the Maroon 5 NYE ball!  I was greeted by Niko who was just an absolute charming fella who I had so much fun chatting with!  After an awful experience at my husbands attempt at a new adventure in Caesar's Palace new Julius Tower where they began construction work on our floor between 2-3am, rolling catering carts by our room into the Team Room next to our room banging trays around and slamming doors, hammers & nails and drills a running - and Caesar's not willing to do anything but downgrade us into the stinky Forum tower for our NYE stay - the MANDARIN ORIENTAL rescued us.  They took us in at 6am!!!  AND they let us sleep in a temporary resting room until our room was ready at noon....without charging us an extra night.  Now that is class.  This 5 star dream come true gets the Award of the Decade for BEST SERVICE EVER!!  You must eat at the cafe - the mint detox juice and all the food is DELICIOUS.  I haven't had a meal that I didn't LOVE and their pastries -well, just try one.  Hmmmmm Mmmmmm good. Kristy is the nicest server -she just makes you want to give her a hug (I may have :-) ) The bell men, the Valet, Servers & Hostesses, the Reception Desk ....everyone here is amazing.  The bartenders at the Sky Lounge probably didn't know how to take my sparkling personality & sense of humor so I won't fault them for looking at me like I was an alien.  :-)  MUST STAY

Kristin does my facials and she is the BEST Esthetician! She is knowledgeable on the skin, nutrition and the products.  This weekend, I got a back and chest "facial" for summer swim suit season, and I can't believe how great my skin looks and feels!  The spa in general is a nice, relaxing environment.  They do monthly memberships like a Massage Envy only with a higher quality staff and services, in MY opinion!

Was our 1st time and we found a new place to frequent!  The place was packed and all comedians were great.  We especially loved Lisa Landry and Emily Galati -was an ab workout from laughing!  Nice venue, good location and nice bar to hang in afterward!

Love this resort and spa. Stay and play here regularly and always love it. Fabulous accommodations, gorgeous Iocation and excellent service! The Joys Spa is the BEST in town. Not only is the Moroccan atmosphere unique, but I've never had a less than wonderful treatment. Took my mom for spa day yesterday for her birthday and it was the best experience. The salon also does GREAT hair. Had a blow out in less than 30 min and it looked gorge!

Hadn't been up here since C4 went away, but Vince and I finally went in on a tip from a neighbor!  We are so glad. Its our new favorite Go-To for delicious food, fun music. Not an elaborate menu so don't expect a book of everything....if you're looking for a book of food to choose from, try one of those silly chains that offers everything in way too big family size portions. Geeez..  What they do have at Local J is FABULISO! Salads are refreshing and tasty, pork sandwich was yummy, and various other appy's and tappas are delightful. Fun, casual hang out especially for the loco locals!  We love what they did with the place and will continue to chill here as long as they'll have us!
