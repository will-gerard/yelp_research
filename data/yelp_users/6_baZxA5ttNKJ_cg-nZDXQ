No good. At all. Prices are awful. 1 star for the piped wasabi.

No stars if I could. This guy is the biggest asshole I've ever met. Paid my 60 dollar copay to be insulted and get my self-esteem shot down. He didn't listen to ANYTHING I was saying to him. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. I've never felt so awful leaving a doctors office before in my life.

I am biased, beware...but my love runs deep for Yucca!  Used to live walking distance so I frequented the spot.  Its a great dive bar to escape the "Mill Ave scene".  Bartenders are always super friendly and fun & I love the electronic jukebox.  There are always some interesting talents playing next door in the venue & sometimes I am really pleasantly surprised (Dry River Yacht Club was an interesting band who I ended up really liking).    I really like the fact that it is split up so you don't HAVE to listen to the music in the next room, you can hang out in a booth, at the bar, or play some pool. Small outdoor patio space along Southern if you smoke & drinks are okay too.  The location might freak some people out if they're used to hanging out in Old Town or something but I promise it is quality fun without all the spray tans & hair gel.  So many memories. I miss the shit out of Yucca! Go here & get a peanut butter cup shot-don't forget the salt.

I just recently moved back from NYC and was faithful to my threading but I read so many amazing reviews for Amanda on here and I was more than thrilled after leaving! Her specialty is keeping your brows full and beautiful and she does it very well. I have never had someone as attentive as her work on my brows. She is definitely a perfectionist!   Amanda also has a wealth of knowledge regarding skin as well! I had 1 million and 1 questions about brows, skincare and who knows what else. She makes you feel extremely comfortable and safe the entire time. So no need to fear walking out with half an eyebrow!   I left feeling like I gained a new friend and will definitely be giving her my business as long as I'm in Arizona!
