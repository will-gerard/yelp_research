THE VEGETARIAN ANGLE  When you can date a review to the exact day (and with good reason), you know that you're in a special place.  We ate at Payton Curry's pop-up restaurant at the Welcome Diner last night, April 19, 2011, and the following is what we ate, but you may have a different menu on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday evenings from 5pm-close through July 4.  Chef, I hear, tries to keep it real and keep it local and fresh when sourcing his menu, so it changes each week.  McClendon's Select was mentioned more than once.  (PRICE NOTE:  On Tuesdays from 10pm-close, the menu is 1/2 price to be sure Curry exhausts his fresh produce and meats.)  Welcome Diner was serving about 12 people when we arrived, 6 at the inside counter and three couples outside dotting the front yard, set up with a picnic table, a sawhorse, some two tops, and glass tabletop lanterns.  The food came out quickly, and our gracious and knowledgeable server asked if we'd like our dishes as they were prepared or in courses. We opted for the former.  My darling dining partner and I shared all four dishes.  THOSE DAMN GREEN BEANS We started with green beans, as crisp as they were picked, with just one tip snapped off, just like my grandmother taught me.  These were served with a citrus creme fraiche and some recently picked tarragon.  I always love dairy with tarragon, and this dish, served cool (not cold) if I remember, was dusted with local bee pollen, granular bits that taste of honey and something else and melt on your tongue.  MOZZARELLA The menu insists there's basil in this tangential rendition of caprese -- and there probably is -- but the takeaway message from this panko-encrusted slab of mozzarella with the sweetest tomatoes I've eaten is a sweet-n-sour burst with every olive oily bite.  A standout appetizer.  GNOCCHI If you're like me, when you've eaten or prepared gnocchi before, you assume they get plopped into the boiling salted water before the plump up and rise to the surface.  Not so fast, Barilla Boy.  Payton Curry's gnocchi, I believe, are (dry?) pan-seared on both sides,   keeping all the doughy, gummy deliciousness often lost in the water.  The madeira wine and cream reduction here smothers the pillowy gnocchi and tooth-tender walnuts and squiggly good morel mushrooms in a way that makes you close your eyes, shut off your hearing, and attempt to pour all of your sensory energy into taste and smell.  When eating this dish, I more than once covered my face with my hand to shield what may have been unflattering facial pangs of ecstasy.    LEMON CURD We struggled to choose this dessert over the Strawberry Olive Oil Cake and Strawberry Malt, but we got our strawberry fix as the second layer in this delectable parfait, topped with the airiest foamy meringue, and served in a mason jar.  The macerated strawberries made you want to relive childhood and replace mom's jelly with Payton's strawberries to accompany Laura Scudder in your PB&J sandwich.  We clanged spoons at the bottom of the jar for the last bit of bee pollen.  $62 with tax and tip.  We didn't bring a BYOB wine but would next time.  (The $13 corkage fee seems high, but there ought to be an explanation for that.)  Everyone working in the tiny dinette and serving the tables outside had huge smiles and loads of enthusiasm for what they were contributing to the Garfield neighborhood and to the downtown culinary scene.  Others are taking notice, too. Michelle Laudig (former restaurant critic at Phoenix New Times) and Aaron Chamberlin of St. Francis both dropped in during our dinner.  I worry about the AZ heat baking the charm out of patio dining in May, June, and July for Chef Curry, but I hope to return in April...maybe on a Tuesday at 10pm for half-price eats.

I popped in at 9:30am on a Sunday morning expecting a bustling bakery with fresh-baked everything. I brought 13 bagels to my students and we found them to be stale.  These bagels were in baskets behind the counter, so I figured they were baked the same morning.  The attendant was no-nonsense but friendly.  I will try the sweet pastries next time.

I agree with Ben H and others about the sandwiches here.  The stuffed eggplant sandwich especially -- eggplant parm is just okay -- makes me a weekly customer at Calabria, which has impressed me since its days on Roosevelt in the spot currently occupied by Lola Coffee.  I used to go on Tuesdays for the $5 sandwich deal, but even when that promotion ended, I still pick up that yummy stuffed eggplant.  The location at 7th St. and Virginia seems prime for commuters, but the parking situation (two or three angled spots in front, more in back) seems to be a challenge.  I often find the place empty on weekday afternoons.  Going into summer, Calabria needs steady traffic, I imagine, to stay afloat.  I'm not sure if the recent Groupon promotion helped -- I hope so.

SAVES GAS.  Because I started commuting to work via Valley Metro Light Rail, I haven't put gas in my car in 8 weeks.  SAVES MONEY. Instead, my work subsidizes my 31 Day Local METRO card, so I pay $22.50 each month to ride the clean, efficient, on-time train.  Even the $1.25 full fare one-way or $2.50 full fare all-day passes are reasonable, and you can transfer to the bus system on the same are.  SAVES TIME.  Instead of fighting traffic, I can read a novel or the newspaper or Yelp on my iPhone!  SAVES COMMUNITY.  When I ride, I try to talk to at least one new person per trip. (If you're that bearded man who ignored me, I forgive you.)  People complain of a sprawling, impersonal Phoenix that is allergic to local community.  Well, then, I try to make Phoenix as local as possible by taking the train, frequenting local independents, and trying to be a part of the community solution.  SAVES BIKES.  I mean this quite literally.  I ride my bike 1.5 miles to the rail station and when the train comes, I raise my bike up onto the hook (or sometimes just stand with it) in one of the four slots per car, and then I chill.  The bike amenities make the Light Rail + Bus system a nearly full-feature mass transit system.  THE NEGATIVE.  Other yelpers have noted the limited night-time hours of operation (save the occasional extended hours for a Suns game).  I agree that the City of Phoenix should step in and use the light rail as an opportunity to extend hours on weekends as an overture to stem the drunk-driving rampant in AZ.  Also, and this is very minor, one morning the doors closed before I could enter with my bike.  When I pressed the yellow button, nothing happened; when a sympathetic passenger inside the train pushed the inside button, nothing happened.  I was on time for the train but the train would let me enter.    Thanks, Voters of Arizona, for approving the transportation sales tax necessary to begin, sustain, and complete construction on this pulse-providing, community-building light rail system.

Heidi and Doug not only helped furnish a third of my house with distinct, mid-century pieces, they also continue to infuse 7th Ave. (and all of Central Phoenix) with community-minded events, lectures, and parties.  They are very knowledgeable in Danish Modern especially, and they offered fair deals (when compared with Red Modern).  I went to the kickoff party for Modern Phoenix Week, and Doug and Heidi let us carry on well past the posted party hours.  What a great space to linger and luxuriate with Bertoia, Eames, Sottsass, Saarinen, Jacobsen, and others.  The house cat's harness is precious, too.  With Modern Manor next door, this may be a one-stop mid-century plop.

The strongest statement about The Breadfruit can be made be its owner/chef:  He doesn't have any restaurant experience; he's just making the traditional Jamaican recipes of his grandmother.  And it works.  I took my two vegan friends to The Breadfruit on a weeknight and the small restaurant was about half-full.  There are two IKEA tables with chairs in the grass in front of the restaurant for al fresco dining.  As we waited for the delicious Avocado and Plantain Spring Rolls ($6.75), we had plenty to talk about with our drink orders: Hibiscus-infused Tea ($3.50) and the Carrot Juice ($3.50).  Pricing seems steep, but in all fairness, these were beverages worth every penny.  The Breadfruit is BYOB ($5/wine, $5/six-pack, or $1/beer bottle corkage fee), but I had forgotten this drunken little detail.   We asked if there were more vegan options than the two clearly marked entrees, and he confirmed that most of the starters/sides were vegan, too.  (Warning: the spinach patty contains beef broth in the crust.  Our server returned from the kitchen to let us know.)  We decided to share everything.  The Tofu Curry ($9.75) is a nice, complete meal served with Rice & Peas (beans), steamed cabbage and bell pepper, and a side of baked plantains.  The Breadfruit has also added a new item, Pop Cho and Pickled Ginger ($9.75), a sautee of bok choy, onions, and rice wine vinegar, which is served with a memorable Jamaican sweet potato mash.  The side of grilled corn ($2) was juicy and sweet, with no dead kernels.  The festivals is not your everyday bread stick, and the subtle sweetness had us wondering if vanilla is the only sweetening agent.  During the meal, we all noted the teeny-tiny sink in the more than ample bathroom.  The primary color walls are juxtaposed nicely against exposed brick, and the kitchen is open and you can see the duo chefs preparing the food.  The service was prompt and courteous.  For dessert, we shared the delectable Sweet Potato Pudd'n ($5.50), which is acompact wedge of sweet potato, ginger, nutmeg, and raisins, baked with coconut flakes on top.  Perhaps it's a bit dry for some tastes, but we found it most enough, and we battled with forks for the last bite.  At this point, one of the chefs came out and asked with a bright warm smile if we were the vegan table.  She herself, she said, was a vegan.  She mentioned that the Sweet Potato Pudd'n was the giveaway The Breadfruit had at the recent West of Western Culinary Festival held at the Phoenix Art Museum.  Her visit was like a second dessert; it's always so nice to so the excitement of the chef who has just prepared your food.  The Breadfruit is a strong addition to the downtown culinary scene, now bustling on that corner of 1st and Pierce with PastaBAR, Sens, and The Turf Accountant.

I like to get about one hundred burritos under my belt before I review a taco shop. In all honesty, America's Taco Shop is my neighborhood go-to place for my bean fix.  I stop by on my bike ride home.  (By the way, where did the red bike rack go? It disappeared when the front patio grew. One-star deduction for disabling your cycling customers.)  As other vegetarians have pointed out, the bean-and-cheese burrito is one of few veggie options (salsa, guacamole, vegetarian quesadilla, corn) at America's, but it makes the place.  I've heard rumors that the beans are not pinto, but some other two-word variety. Pray tell, America's.  For a party at my house, I ordered triple salsa and chips and America's more than doubled this catering order in a large foil chafing dish.  People often complain about the narrow options here, but I for one like a restaurant whose identity is clear -- carne asada and the best beans in town -- and sticks to it.  The corn with cheese and hot sauce is hit or miss, depending on the tenderness and sweetness of the kernels that day, but subpar America's corn is still good corn.  Bring back the bike rack, please.

Still a consistent place for a unique bean and cheese burrito, a crave-worthy breakfast burrito, and a fresh tomato-and-cilantro-heavy salsa.  Many of the 2-star ratings focus on portion size and price, but for a regular meal made from scratch (not a super-sized gorge fest that is drive-thru Mexican), America's is a strong value; plus, you can meet the owners, unlike the corporate -berto's model.  They still need a bike rack though. -1 star.

Comfortable. Refined. Inventive. Consistent.  One-star deduction for no vegetarian entree.  The Tuck Shop is such a welcome arrival in our Coronado neighborhood.  I like stopping there on my bike for a beer after work; or taking friends and sitting in the reading room for cocktails; or having an intimate dinner; or taking in the sounds of local bands at the Coronado Home Tour.  Much has been said about the architect-hip decor, and I feel right at home here.  I'll skip to the food.  For vegetarians, there are a few stand-by dishes, all small plates or salads, listed here in my order of delectability (#1 is the best):  1. Roasted Baby Beets in Spiced Mustard Creme ($6) 2. Baby lettuce, avocado salad, fennel, blood orange ($8) 3. Panini bites; grilled pear, arugula, taleggio, honey ($7) 4. Patatas bravas, spicy tomato sauce, aoili ($5) 5. Grilled baguette, creamy roasted garlic with olive oil ($5) 6. Panko-walnut crusted fontina, savory and sweet dipping sauces ($6)  Sometimes I return just for the beets, which I absolutely cannot reproduce at home.  Suggestion:  It would be nice to have a vegetarian main dish option, and I hope Tuck Shop responds soon.  Cocktails in the reading room replete with old-school games (Labyrinth!), colored pencils, architecture books, etc., make waiting easy.  And sometimes I just eat in the reading room itself.  Since they make their own mixers (ginger ale, tonic, lemonade) and serve Tito's (Texas) vodka, no hangover and no sickeningly sweet afterburn.  Service here is on-point, especially with the acute attention to detail of the manager, John.  He always makes sure to come say hello.  Now, I have had some errant pours brought to my table.  My vodka-ginger ale came as a vodka-lemonade, and then my vodka ginger ale came as a gin & tonic. John offered to remake the drinks without a problem.  I am impressed with Tuck Shop in its nascent stage.  Add a vegetarian main, and I'll add a star!

I've been to Tuck Shop about ten times now, and there is still no vegetarian entree.  Perhaps worse is that their best small plate, the roasted baby beets, has been removed from the menu because of exorbitant market prices for local beets.  Still a 4-star experience because of the delicious cocktails, perfect reading room, and Best Front of the House in Town, John.

Erin Go Bring Me my Check!  I applaud Seamus McCaffrey for taking it slow when opening his sister pubs (Rosie's and now Turf), but this pub near Sens, PastaBAR, and The Breadfruit has some serious deficits to remedy.  I took my Phoenix transplant friend, Katie C, for a late breakfast on Saturday around 11am before our trip to Downtown Phoenix Public Market.  Passing through the modest patio at the entrance to The Turf (Accountant), we entered a large open space with dark, wood paneling, polished metallic-speckled concrete floors, drop-down Starbucks-reminiscent glass lamps, and not a single visible patron to be found.  The glossy, just-opened cleanliness of the pub made it look like a miniature Yard House Restaurant: four flat-panel TVs displaying futbol and basketball, too far away to follow, too TV-ish to ignore, suggesting, "We are pub for a quiet pint...No, we are music venue (see the stage!)...No, we are a wee modest sportsbar."  Conflicted.  At the bar, I flipped through the menu to see if breakfast was still being served, and I was told by the bartender that the posted Sat-Sun-Mon breakfast hours of 7-10am had been extended to noon.  I mean, really, who's racing to the pub for breakfast before 10am on a weekend?  We chose a booth along a side wall and noted that the swirled, multi-green upholstery was either retro or contemporary or both. (Conflicted.)  When we sat down, the server at a nearby booth rose from her intimate conversation with a blond man and asked us for our drink orders.  Coffee and water.  After some deliberation and discussion of real Irish soda bread, Katie ordered the french toast and I ordered the Traditional Irish Breakfast, minus the meat (sausage or bacon; black and white pudding).  To her credit, the server said I'd be wasting money with that order and should order the simple eggs and hashbrowns and substitute in the fried tomato and soda bread.  I asked for poached eggs, but the server returned minutes later, saying, "We don't have poached eggs."  Okay, then, over medium.  Our breakfast arrived quickly; by now, only one other two-top was being served in the palatial pub.  The french toast ("Some of the best french toast I've had," Katie said) came with a giant ramekin of butter but no syrup.  We asked for the syrup, and at the end of the meal, Katie almost asked for the butter to-go; it was seriously an entire stick of butter.  My egg breakfast didn't have the side of fried tomato (a staple of English and Irish breakfasts), and when I asked for it, she brought two sad mealy tomato slices, unfried.  The soda bread was dense and dry and bland and dotted with four measly raisins.  Throughout the service, our distracted waitress (think: Reese Witherspoon + Jewel) was pleasant but forgetful.  She spent her time between tables sitting with the blond man in the booth, close-talking and smiling.  Was he another waiter or her boyfriend?  I joked to Katie that I should bring a girlfriend to my classroom and give her smooches in between the grammar lessons I teach.  She filled my water and coffee often, but her casual presence at the booth across from us blurred the lines of professionalism.  The bill for two breakfasts (including substitutions, which she didn't charge for) and a coffee was $16.  Very reasonable.  I guess we got what we paid for.  Katie noted that most people don't choose an Irish pub for their breakfast/brunch, but the Turf hardly tried, it seemed.  And with Palatte closing, I wanted to give Seamus a shot.    I will definitely return in the evening to have a $5.50 Imperial Pint of Guiness, but I will not return for breakfast.

Thank you, Kris and Craig DeMarco, for bringing Postino Central to CenPho: we've been waiting for you.  While we'll miss the charm and $2.79 breakfast of Katz Deli, the refurbishment of this pearl of a 60s building north of Camelback warrants commendation.  The original cinder-block and brick edifice has been preserved, but the remaining vestiges of Katz's greasy blue-boothed diner-feel have gone away.  The stained concrete floor is shined up to reflect the myriad votive candles dotting nearly every ledge space.  A view across the 1,000 square-foot, one-room design reveals smart furniture and several table arrangements: plush booths, a coffee table and vintage chair lounge, traditional wooden two and four-tops, high bistro tables, the long concrete bar inside, and the matching concrete bar on the back of the restaurant, where a comfortable patio meets the inside space with large windows that swing up and open. The large glass doors facing Central Ave. also open to create a breeze from front to back. (You definitely feel that the design of Postino Arcadia informed the restoration of Postino Central.)  My yelper-friend K.G. brought me to a fundraiser here on Saturday night, and though the full menu from Postino Arcadia wasn't available, the pinot noir and chardonnay that were selected for the event were strong choices.  The familiar array of bruschetta and the stand-by cheese platter served on the bar/communal table were abundant and tasty.  My personal favorites remain the tomato, basil, and mozzarella; the warm artichoke spread; the roasted peppers and goat cheese; and the ricotta with dates & pistachios.  Postino continues to succeed with cheeses that retain distinctive and memorable flavor.  This is defiantly not one-taste-fits-all cheese.  From the dessert tray of Tammie Coe delights, I grabbed what I thought was a Russian Tea Ball but soon found out this was a decadent, sell-your-soul chocolate truffle dusted in powdered sugar.  With the pinot chaser, oh, dear me...it was close-your-eyes good.  The servers were in full force with at least 10-15 prim and polished attractive bartenders, runners, wine-glass fillers working the front of the house for the event.  We liked Stevie with the hipster hat and fun haircut the best.  His most memorable rejoinder when we hesitated at his request to fill our glasses again was "I'm just going to pour it in.  You don't even have to drink it."  Occasionally you'd see front and back of the house mingling through the order-up slot window into the kitchen.  Foodies of Phoenix want to see the chefs working their magic.  Now on to the restroom.  The sliding doors to the mens and ladies are frosted.  The circular tiles throughout cause a double-take as does the deep sink.  Noticeably absent is a mirror, and I imagine this will be remedied by the March 30 official opening of the winebar.  But without a mirror to inspect my red-wine teeth, I was a self-conscious swiller.  Postino Central is a three-minute walk from the light rail stop at Camelback and will be a mainstay hangout for CenPho mavens who enjoy wine and open-air lounging.  After the Grand Opening, I'll return to see how they're doing as a winebar with full menu, and I imagine my star rating will reach 5.

If you get a tall bistro table at Teakwoods and a pail of tossable peanuts, you feel like a baby in a high chair: you can throw food on the floor and the people in charge think you are acting your age.  For a game day, Teakwoods provides quick beers, limitless peanuts, and some of the best tater tots in town.  (Order mild or hot wing sauce on the side.)  The veggie burger is passable: better than your jerk-friend's paltry meatcentric backyard bbq garden patty but several racks below Houston's inventive saucy offering.  Teakwoods is about nuts, tots, and suds. Let's face it.

The second location of Fair Trade Cafe is a disappointing missed opportunity.  Descending the concrete steps into the patio of metal furniture promises a great bunker of caffeination.  Instead, this ASU-adjacent location feels like a university's student union coffee shop from the early 1990s.  I'm not anti concrete and glass and steel, but this space feels thrown together and unfit for an afternoon or evening of quiet conversation, study, or reading. Not cozy.  Plus (or should I say "Minus"?), there were no ceramics to serve their coffee and espresso in, which reminds me of the early days at Hob Nobs.  May I say out loud that you must not open your coffee shop unless you have ceramic mugs and demitasse cups on day one?  Try drinking an espresso or espresso macchiato from a 12 oz. paper cup.  It's on your face. Quickly.

Just because the server will take back a poorly mixed drink or charred beans doesn't make it a good place to eat and drink.  The food at Hula's needs to be good and consistent, not just returnable.  On a Saturday night, four of us hit Hula's at 6pm.  What's so striking when you enter is how open the bar and dining room are to the patio, which needs a few more tables and chairs, I'd say.  Central Phoenix enthusiasts love a good adaptive reuse project, and the one at Hula's, especially because of the preservation of the impressive and large hexagonal window, puts it in the same category as Postino Central and St. Francis as far as an amateur's view of architectural renovations.  We started by sharing the sweet potato fries, which are on-par with Maizie's and even those at Delux.  They were crisp, evenly cut, and intensely creamy and sweet.  After this, though, it was downhill.  Though my companions enjoyed their drinks, my Zombie, served in a tall opaque glass with a mustachioed character who looked a lot like me, was poorly mixed, lacking lime juice, and faintly soap-tasting.  The server gave me a couple minutes to weigh the drink's future, and after agreeing to suffer through it, I changed my mind and sent it back.  (The Zombie would later still appear on the bill.)  The Dark & Stormy I ordered in its place, with dark rum and ginger beer, was drinkable, but inferior to the drink of the same name at St. Francis, which, for $2 more, tastes $4 better.  I think it's in the quality of the ginger beer.  My friend's fishcakes were mostly overcooked and had to be cut with a knife, like chicken.  The ceviche, though palatable, my other friend said, appeared dry and haphazardly plated with some giant tortilla chips.  As the lone veggie in the bunch, I ordered the Spicy Tofu Tacos, which come with a spicy chili sauce and a side of rice and black beans.  Though the food came out of the kitchen quickly -- 12 minutes or so -- I wish it hadn't.  The tofu, a recently unpackaged watery brick no doubt, was merely sliced, warmed (not grilled or fried or marinated over night), and dusted with chili powder; therefore, the tofu was tasteless.  The tacos were double-wrapped in flour tortillas, which created a thick, awkward mouthfeel, so I just used one of the tortillas on each of my two tacos.  But the most disappointing part of the meal was the rice and beans, which are hard to screw up.  The black beans were so badly burned in the pot that even their juices saturated the scoop of rice with their charred, charcoal (bad) smoke flavor.  I mentioned this to the server, and she later would deduct half of the plate's $11 price (though the extra Zombie remained on the ticket).  We passed on dessert and went to St. Francis and later Fez for drinks.  Hula's would be a great happy hour spot on the patio if it offers consistent drinks and some happy hour food specials.  Two stars for potential, and I will try once more.  As it stands now, though, an accommodating server cannot compensate for an inconsistent bartender, burned beans, and uninventive vegetarian options.  note: I am totally aware that restaurants don't have to cater to my or other people's various dietary preferences (i.e., vegetarians and vegans), and that I choose to go to these restaurants.  I just want some rice and beans to rely on.

ESPRESSO  I'm a macchiato man, stained through and through, and Matt Poole marks his Four Barrel espresso with Strauss organic milk, so I am a happy man at Giant.  The sparkling water sidecar they serve with espressos and macchiatos is an expert touch. The espresso is smoother, say, than the coppery undertones of Lux, and Giant serves it in handle-less demitasse ceramics that are hot (not too hot) to the touch.  PASTRY and FOOD  The daily breakfast burrito (wrapped for takeaway or reheated and served on a plate in 12-15 minutes) is rarely vegetarian, but when it is, the tortilla is flaky, the eggs fluffy, and the peppers and potatoes local.  The bread pudding is chewy delicious.  I usually opt for the toasted bagel because the fresh-daily cream cheese is varied and fresh (dill or bell paper or carrot).  AMBIENCE  On weekends and afternoons, it's less swarmed than Lux or Lola, and feels open and clean with concrete floors, high ceilings, clean lines, and bold materials (steel, wood, glass).  The floor-to-ceiling glass panels accordion fold back to reveal a totally open front, great for gazing at Cancer Survivor's Park, Phoenix Art Museum, and McDowell & Central Ave.  Bunky next door is sleepy, but every item is artfully placed.  Occasional succulents dot the interior and exterior.  EXTRAS  Giant now accepts credit/debit via the nifty Square app on the house iPad.   The music rarely changes, and I have been hearing the same playlist for about a year (Spoon, Heartless Bastards, etc.).  Giant has dog treats, but I believe they prefer pups to be on the stoop out front.  No bike rack currently but a convenient railing serves just fine.

Remember Drip Coffee Lounge on 7th St.?  Well, the breakfast and lunch spot has passed through a wall ten feet north and has re-christened itself Toast, which as far as namesakes go, makes sense, considering their numerous offerings of toast + toppings.  I had the beans on toast with a fried egg (subbing out bacon for tomato slices) and felt like I was in London again.  Old favorites from Drip including the NYC Sandwich remain as well on the chalkboard menu.  The coffee is still the same: espresso pulls.  No longer will the name "Drip" mislead customers to think that "drip coffee" is served, which it's not.  My espresso macchiato (soy) is consistent but still served in a much oversized latte mug.  Can I get a demitasse up in here?  Coronado is my neighborhood, and I walk or bike to Toast regularly; although there's no bike rack at present, owners Gina Madrid and Vine Saccento graciously allow me to roll my wheels in and park my ride in the back.  The space is smaller with room for just over a dozen or so people inside and about a half-dozen outside.  Same Modernica chairs and white on white scheme throughout, including a sleek pastry case, designed by Vine and stocked with MJ Breads.  The "no computers" sign displayed in the window denotes a shift in culture from Drip (and most Phx coffee shops, for that matter), but in my three or four visits so far, business still seems steady.  Nonetheless, if people are to relax and chat (and not tip-tap-type the day away on laptops), a dozen fiberglass shell chairs, four bar stools, and the absence of a sofa seem to fly in the face of the old school coffee shop mission.  I will continue to visit Gina and Vine at Toast for breakfast (for me, usually a $11-14 including tip trip) because the food is on-point, the espresso a contender, and their commitment to local independents steadfast.  [I'm keeping an eye on the space formerly occupied by Drip.  Gina and Vine mentioned some sort of retail venture there that they're planning.]

Dear 16th Street,  Please continue to bring it!  Just yesterday a colleague at school told me he thought Barrio Cafe's food was diminishing in oomph.   I disagreed, but that evening, I just so happened to bike over to La Condesa to try out this new gourmet taco place on 16th.  The cursive red neon sign, that word "gourmet" and the dozens of Yelp endorsements ushered us in on a Tuesday night.  Warm walls. Original paintings. Furnishings from Bellas Artes de Mexico.  The most substantial wooden tables and chairs in central Phoenix.  When we had opportunity in our conversation to "knock on wood," we felt a bit shamed by the feebleness of our gesture and the robustness of the table.  Order at the counter from a cheerful and demure young lady, whose accent we could not place.  I linger on the ambiance because others have noted the stellar food.  Your food food for thought:  Come for the two taco meal (with beans & rice (with corn!)), and stay for the fresh and diverse salsa bar.  This isn't Baja Fresh.  This is Condesa cuisine.  Think jicama and orange salsa.  Think peanut salsa. And the creamiest, zingiest cilantro creme salsa!  I must disagree with Lali about the beans: America's Tacos' are more memorable, but you are still right, Lali, on a technicality -- the beans at America's are not pinto...It's a secret. Not really. Ask them.

THE VEGETARIAN ANGLE:  Dinner for four at 6:30pm on a First Friday could have been trouble, but there was no waiting, no rushed service, and no diminished quality from the kitchen.  We were seated in the corner bench area in what I'd call a "studio restaurant" -- 12 or so seats, 5 bar stools, and in-your-face adjacent, bustling kitchen made for a lively and somehow uncramped 2-hour meal.  Chef Osburn's menu had us perplexed by the varied and extensive offerings coming out of that tiny kitchen.  We spent 15 minutes discussing the menu and sipping   APP: The white bean trio finds a way to present cannellini in three distinguished ways, but the puree with truffle oil lingers after the plate is taken away and breaks the three-way tie. The bread is deceivingly ordinarily looking, has a dusting of seasoning and absorbs olive oil very well.  [memorable ingredient: TRUFFLE OIL]  SALAD: With Mom I shared the grape, apple, arugula salad that's served with blood oranges, smoked paprika cashews, and the most appropriately light application of blue cheese dressing I've ever had.  The oranges gushed, the apples snapped and crunched, the cashews were not overly smoked, and the arugula was crisp, not limp.  [memorable ingredient: perfectly purple BLOOD ORANGE fillets]  MAIN: The gnocchi with season vegetables (artichokes, butternut squash, shitake mushrooms, leeks) reminded me that the fare at Centurion is decidedly French-Italian.  The sherry reduction with a touch of cream draws a sweetness across the top of rich squash, nutty mushrooms, and lemony artichokes...very lemony.  The gnocchi themselves were plump with a satisfying tooth-feel without being mushy or gummy or too potato-forward.  The dish -- like the others -- came out piping out, and with any pasta+cream dish, was best in the first 5-10 minutes.  [memorable ingredient: SHERRY]  DESSERT: The table shared two: the espresso cup and the flourless chocolate cake.  The centerpiece item of the first was a dark chocolate demitasse cup -- yes, an espresso cup made from chocolate -- filled with an espresso mousse and toped with molten caramel.  The dense chocolate cup was a fun transport for the airy mousse.  (Idea: A graham cracker baked lid might have made this an interesting s'mores update.)  The flourless cake was also dense but not brick-dense, and the accompanying berry and apple-lemon purees made each bite a bit different. [memorable ingredient: APPLE-LEMON puree]  SERVICE: During dinner the delightful server showed acumen in food knowledge and was attentive to everything from water to wine to cutlery to change for the parking meter.  When we arrived, the restaurant was serving about five guests.  When we left Centurion's small dining area and front patio were full.  A strong meal for sure. I'll be back to try Sunday brunch soon.

Everything about PHX BIKE is custom.  Palmer Kelley has opened a micro-sized shop in downtown Phoenix (Central/Monroe), but the customer service for me was huge.  He builds bikes from scratch, but he also has vast knowledge of BMX, fixed gear, and vintage bikes, too, like my old 50s Triumph.  I was trying to replace a broken Brooks B72 saddle, so a friend advised me to call up Palmer on a Friday morning.  He was enthusiastic about my bike, and said he had a couple of Brooks distributors he worked with.  Palmer was generous with his time and expertise, and we placed the order for a Brooks B66 and slender leather grips by the end of the day.  Palmer emailed me an update on the delivery date early the next week, and by the following Thursday, he had installed the new saddle and grips.  On my way out of the store, we noticed a fraying break line, so he switched that out too.  The saddle angle was too steep, so he adjusted that as well -- all the while I knew he was trying to get out of town for the weekend.  I appreciated his patience and willingness to make me happy with my bike.  There was a miniscule upcharge on the saddle and grips, and the break line replacement was $8.  I'm so grateful to have great customer service from a downtown bike shop.

After three consecutive and consistent Saturday breakfasts (poached eggs, Chef's potatoes, fruit, and an everything bagel this time), I'm upping Perc Up to 4 stars.  (I just realized the name of this place is a pun on "perk up" and "per cup."  Nice one.)  The level of service was commendable here, considering how busy it was this morning.  Before my sale was final, I was kindly informed that the English muffins today were store-bought (she guessed Thomas), so I opted for the Chompies everything bagel.  I appreciated this simple gesture.  When my breakfast arrived (10 minutes), the server brought me some cream cheese on the house, which is nice, since so many other places would nickel-and-dime the accouterments.  The coffee is growing on me, too.  All told, this is a very good Coronado place to get some work done on the free wifi with no worry of being forced out.

As of January 2, 2012, Perc Up Coffee Cafe has changed owners, hours of operation, menu, and names.  Same espresso machine and coffee.  The Wy~Knot Cafe seems to offer more vegetarian and vegan options. (That is a tilde, not a hyphen in the name.)  No Yelp page yet.

Ollie Vaughn's is a great Coronado neighborhood spot that provides a salad when you want it, a pastry when you need it, a kick-butt toddy when you crave it, and a darling back patio.  Add to this Lindsey Magee's signature on the fresh and inventive kitchen, and you've got a hit.  On Thanksgiving morning, Lindsey opened for two hours to make sure those of us who forgot to order pies could gobble up some of her extras. The apple cinnamon was delicious, but the chocolate/walnut/fernet pie was the winner that night.

As a Coronado resident, I appreciate how this renewed space treats its neighbors: free cup of coffee. (They couponed my door earlier this week.)  Today, though, I paid for my scone and macchiato since I'd left the coupon at home. Totally worth it. The espresso is up there with Giant. And the dark chocolate and cherry scone was appropriately sized, not a big box bakery Goliath. Perhaps too much raw sugar on top. I brushed a bit off.   The space offers a better feel than Coronado Cafe and Urban Vine (terrible name) did. Decor is Lux meets Cartel,  and the wood floor homifies it warmly.   Though no demitasse cups yet, the super-friendly and accommodating barista offered me the macchiato in a tiny glass jar. Worked for me.   $2 off signature cocktails during happy hour. A very intriguing lunch and dinner menu with nearly all entries vegan. Can't wait to go for weekend breakfast.   Welcome to the neighborhood.

The server brought us some gratis potato tacos. Savory and delicious, but the double corn tortilla likely unnecessary. One will do.   I had the Monte Vista torta and the standout components were the salty zucchini and buoyant focaccia. A bit pricey at $11 but a solid lunch.   We had the back room for five of us. A bit echoey but cozy and private.   Can't wait to try the cocktails.

These guys are fast and thorough. My Yelp quote request was answered within 30 minutes...on a Sunday. Jason and his partner were at my house the next day doing 16 windows with screens and three glassed doors. They double and triple-checked their work and even wiped every window well where dirt collects.  (I learned through their observation that I have a plexiglass window mixed in with my glass windows, too.)  They were polite, friendly, and conscientious in answering my questions. They even wore booties for the inside work.  They honored the quote and finished in 90 minutes. I will use them again after the monsoons.
