I know this review is worthless but I've always had such a good time here. The champagne brunch and buffet is second to none when it comes to Sunday mornings. The champagne flows until you become obnoxious, inappropriate, and obliterated. Needless to say I have a new hatred for Walgreens. R.I.P. El Torrito on scottsdale rd. you will be missed by all.

I found Harlow's Cafe one morning in Tempe. I found the service to be excellent, maybe the best I've ever had despite the fact that it always seems to be crowded they get people in and out of the restaurant quickly. The portions were huge and at affordable prices. The food is delicious, huevos rancherous and the cisco plate are both excellent choices.  The feeling of a mom and pop atmosphere comes to mind. The old style booth seating, and canvas paintings on the wall are a nice touch. I've always gotten my food in an extremely quick manner, and at the same time never felt rushed. I would recommend Harlow's cafe to anyone and see myself becoming a frequent customer.

I don't know if I'd ever go to Macayo's if it didn't have $2 Dos Equis and a free buffet on Fridays. The food is your typical Mexican chain food. The patio is huge which is a plus between 75 and 95 degrees after that it gets pretty torturous. All in all, it's an alright spot to crash out with friends after work on Fridays.

Best place to eat breakfast in Phoenix, bold but well deserved. I stumbled across this fine establishment one Sunday morning and wasn't disappointed one bit after eating at local breeze.   The fire island eggs were amazing and complimented with a little green Tabasco sauce added the perfect touch.  The patio is huge and open creating the perfect setting for some sangria or mimosa whichever you prefer. They also offer a "going green incentive" with 15% off for bike riders on Sundays.   Keep doing what your doing, because its right!
