You can't get better than this store for every type of baking supply you need - and stuff you didn't know you needed until you saw it there.

I originally tried this salon a year ago, mostly because it is fairly close to where I work, they took a late appointment on a Friday night, and there were some good comments here. I was in a hurry to find a new stylist who could accommodate my crazy work schedule and agree to stay late when necessary.   I am so impressed with the work that these people do, that I had to write about it. Let's face it - there are hundreds of hair salons out there and thousands of stylists. When you find someone who is an expert colorist AND and expert stylist - well those two skills rarely go together in one person. Am I right?  Kelly, the owner of this place, is the bomb . He is an expert colorist and frankly cuts hair like a magician. Some of the previous comments were right on. It's in the heart of Scottsdale but could easily be in downtown Boulder CO or the East Village or San Diego's Gaslamp district. This place is uniquely urban and quirky as can be but when you walk out knowing you look the best you can look - who cares really.  I've watched the other stylists work while I was processing and they all are talented. Last Friday, Kelly took a last minute appointment for my daughter for highlights and a cut and style and the guy stayed until 9:30 PM because he wanted the color to be perfect. That's commitment.  Love this guy and love this place.

I'm not sure why my previous review got sent to the page where it can't be seen and I can't seem to get an answer on this fr yelp so here is my review again.

so I've reviewed this place before, but for some reason my reviews got filtered. Not sure why, as they are showing up on other sites so can't figure this one out.  anyway, this salon is the bomb. Kelly is the owner and he is incredibly talented. I realize that most reviews of salons are done by evangelists because after all, who doesn't love their stylist for making them look gorgeous if  only for a few hours - but I've been to a lot of salons and this one is truly unique.  Beyond the superficial which includes an eclectic accumulation of 60's memorabilia and 90's punk rock, and the bottomless wine while you process - - lies a commitment  to excellence that I've rarely experienced among salon owners.  This owner is always at his salon - whether it's open or closed - he's there updating his product line or learning a new technique or making his place more comfortable for his clients - the man doesn't sleep. He's on a mission of personal and professional excellence that would put Michael Phelps to shame.   I highly recommend this salon and this owner Kelly and/or any of his stylists. Check him out. You will not be disappointed.

What can you say about dry cleaners that hasn't already been said? haha It's just that these guys are great at what they do. They charge a fair price in a category that's over priced, for a service that is excellent. They are very accommodating when you loose your receipt, they'll search all over the place for your items if you swear they're not in your closet but you don't remember if you brought them to the dry cleaners or not, and they bend over backwards to get you that item rushed even if it's not on the schedule. They've been around for ever and there's a reason for that.  They're just good at what they do and it deserves a review.

Love this place. Have you ever heard of anyone writing or saying this about an auto repair shop? This man deserves sainthood. He is professional in his approach to auto maintenance and repair, he is knowledgeable and thorough with his repairs, and he is a totally honest businessman.  Seriously. I wish the man sold cars. Then he would graduate from sainthood to a God. I highly recommend him.

I so wanted to give this a better review, and there are a lot of good things about this place, but they have made some controversial changes since last summer and, well, they are having a little trouble keeping up with the increased customer demand.  First of all, they used to have one of the best happy hour menus around for food quality/variety and drinks for the prices. In the past few months, they have almost doubled the happy hour prices, and shaved some of the most simple amenities from the dishes - kind of like when cereal prices go way up and then you realize that the box sizes have shrunk too. Wow - that's not cool.   So the zuppa di clams used to be excellent and priced well with Italian bread on the side to soak up all that clam/garlic/white wine broth. A short two months later. the happy hour menu posts this at almost twice the original happy hour pricing, the bread costs extra (seriously?) and my most recent order the clams were rubbery and too salty and also slightly smaller portion.  There is very little ambiance to this restaurant - bunches of tables out in the open and close together so no quiet seating or elegance - but I assume that was by design. And that was perfect when it was great Italian food at a good price. Now that the prices are inflated and the food not so good - the "cafeteria style" seating becomes more of an issue. There's just not very much to like here.  Hope they find their way back. It was great when it first opened. Hope they are listening to their customers and reading these reviews. There are an awful lot of dining options in Scottsdale and that place they occupy has seen it's share of former failures.

I actually think this breakfast place deserves a 4.5 star rating but there isn't one here. There are a lot of breakfast places in Scottsdale but they all sort of taste the same - except for this one. And it's not just that the whole wheat pancakes with blueberry compote are moist and delicately delicious - my son had the scrammies with turkey sausage and potatoes and the eggs were delicately flavored, the sausage was generous and well seasoned, and the potatoes were crisp - not mushy like many places.   There is plenty of wait staff around and everyone is extremely pleasant. You get the impression that these folks really like their jobs. The atmosphere is friendly neighborhood - not commercial establishment.  I got take-out a few weeks ago and it was a s good as the dine-in. This place is great.

Fabulous find! A little gem tucked away in No Scottsdale off Raintree and Northsiite. This place takes me back to Westport Ct and a Spa I used to go to when I lived there that specialized in Absolute Customer Service and Total Customer Experience.  From the receptionist to the technicians - this staff is committed to your complete satisfaction.   Anna has been doing my lashes and she is very good. She clearly knows her business and my lashes look natural, better than my own but not fake or flashy. They last at least 2 weeks so I'm not frantic if life gets In the way and I'm not able to make the every-two-weeks fill. She is gentle and professional. And, for my lifestyle, being available on the weekends is critical for me so her schedule is perfect for the working gal.  Yesterday, I had a facial with Gillian. Fantastic. This professional has been in the business for 10 years and has recently located to Scottsdale from CA. La Jolla's   loss is our gain. She listened  thoughtfully to my requests and advised me on the perfect treatment for my unique needs. I highly recommend Anna and Gillian. My only fear in doing so is that they will get totally booked and it will be harder for me to see them.   This special little spa is worth the trip. You'll know it's different for the second you call and speak to their enthusiastic receptionist Emma. She sets the tone for a memorable and exceptional spa experience.

Let's start with their waiting room. It's no JiffyLube. Their lobby is decorated like the sanctuary of a high end salon. And that's just the beginning of your experience when you choose this auto service location.  I took my car here for an oil change. Had a coupon and had never been to one of these shops (found out after talking with the desk manager that there are a few of these across the valley) before. Their service is excellent. They did not treat  me  like a second class citizen for having the discount, they were respectful, and went beyond the value of the service to completely check out my car. When I picked it up, they presented me with a check list that everything was OK. What? When was the last time that happened? Nothing required. Nothing additional needed. Just a completely free service on my car and a free analysis that resulted in no additional repairs and total piece of mind.  I'm a fan. I will be back. This is my new favorite auto repair shop in Scottsdale. Check them out. Their absolute honesty and service philosophy will shock you.

Big disappointment. Let me start by saying I have been getting lash extensions since 2009. I really wanted to like this place - it was convenient and promising. Nice interior, clean and professional. My tech was professional and knew what she was doing. With lash extensions, the product used is as important as the application process and unfortunately, the products this company uses are inferior.   A full set and the lashes started shedding day 2. By the end of the first week, they were completely gone. I kept my fill appointment for the second week and explained to the tech that they had all fallen out. She agreed to try a different glue but I was still charged the full amount for the fill.   Same result. By the end of the first week, they were gone. I cancelled my third appointment.   As I said, I've been getting lashes since 2009 and I have found a great place where I am getting lashes that look great and stay for the 2 weeks as they should. So this place can't blame their product failure on me. Ultimate lash and brow needs to seriously review their product and make some changes or they won't survive.
