Very good. My husband ate the chicken burrito and I had fajitas.  The sides of rice and beans were excellent.  Ask for the jalape√±o salsa.

Excellent food.  Really helpful staff in explaining the different dishes.   The most amazing Thai food menu I have ever seen.  Also great wine cellar.

The food is good, but not the service.  Went for lunch and waited way too long for our food. The waitress never refilled our drinks.  When we finished our meal she continued setting the tables and did not bring our check.   Finally after waiting for 20 minutes, I walked up to the bartender and manager for the check.   Btw, they went chatting and laughing the whole time and could care less about customers needs.  Not a fan of this place!
