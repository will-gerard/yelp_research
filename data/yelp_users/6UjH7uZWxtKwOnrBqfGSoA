I have been to this place two times now. Fred is very friendly and professional. The experience was great and speedy. Would defiantly recommend this place to anyone in need of some dental work done.

Great place. Been going here for a few years now. Best all you can eat option around Phoenix area. Price is really good as well. Would recommend to anyone who loves sushi.

Awesome food. Price is really reasonable for quality that they offer. They have a salad bar with veggies and fish. They offer almost every possible meat cut available.

Probably one of the best go to places if you are looking for a good tasting pita or kebab plate. Service is fast and the place is clean.

What ever you do stay away. Damon is veeeeeery unprofessional and rude. Every single email you send him is answered with almost ( hate ) towards you. He is always right, and you are wrong, no matter what - talk about great customer service. He must pretend to have a doctorate in psichology as well. Just today I emailed him about our A/C service going out and simply added if this matter could be resolved in less than 3 weeks like it did last time. He answered in a very rude manner and told me that the A/C will be fixed according to time frame which is in the contract and also comented that i should stay away from making any other comments about time frames in the past, telling me it was inappropriate to bring it up. I took time to look up the time frame and it was 10 days. At that point I replied to his email that it should take 10 days according to the contract and last time took 3 weeks. He flipped out after this email, started to call me names, telling me i am not accepting my mistakes and not taking responsibility for my actions. I tried to be as polite as i could as to ask him what the hell he was talking about, with no luck he kept emailing me hatehful reremars about me and taking shots at my personal life ( about which he has no knowledge what so ever ). It was around 20 emails of hate from him, i am being serious, he was talking about my life like he knew who i am, basically poring sh*t all over me for no reason what so ever, and taking guesses about my charecter like some kind of doctor, which i am sure he is not. So if you would like this person to be your land lord / broker, you must be insane. STAAAAY AS FAAAAAAR AS POSSIBLE. WOOOOOOORST COMPANY, WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE, WORST PERSON I HAD EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH IN MY LIFE, HONESTLY. JUST RUN AND NEVER LOOK BACK.

I was in need of some important document translation from Russian to English. My friend suggested to call this place as he had done some documents here in the past and was very happy with the service. I must say Irina was really helpful and professional, she took care of my documents in 1 hour. A very pleasant and fast experience. I would say it is the best place to go if you are in need of any document translation.

Not sure what this place is as i never got in, went to smoke some "hookah" at least that is how they usually spell it but here it said "hooka" on the door. Had 3 cop looking security guards by the door and they decided to check my girlfriends purse for guns and stuff. Finally they informed me that i was wearing flip-flops and they would not let me in. Well all i wanted to do was smoke some hookah not go to some club with dress code, i am not sure what it was but it did not look like scottsdale upscale place for all these weird rules. 1 star for that reason. Dress code to smoke hookah - and 3 security guards with actual guns that check ypur purses - sounds pretty stupid to me.

I was referred to this company by my friend, who was very satisfied with their services, and so did I.  From the very first call to the last handshake, there was no an issue i could complain about.  Outstanding job replacing condensar fan motor at 9pm, just three hours after my call to them.  You got a customer for life!
