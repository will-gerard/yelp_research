Pretty disappointed in chuckie cheese! I used to go to one in Simi Valley California growing up and that place was super fun and super huge! I walked into this one and was like "What the heck?!" It was so small and could totally pass for a dirtier version of peter piper pizza. Was so disappointed! Not to mention when I ordered a pizza, they seemed to have "forgotten" about it and we waited a good hour and a half until I had to ask someone where the heck it was! Pizza was as I remembered though. They need more games for the kids!!!! And more prize selections! Probably wont go back ):

I really cannot express how I feel about this place with a simple 5 stars. This place was absolutely AMAZING! My boyfriend took us here as a surprise for our first valentine's day together. I was a bit skeptical at first since this is downtown chandler (which I HATE) and I had never heard of it before. Especially because it's the only one around. So we get in and it was very intimate and relaxing. Our server was on top of everything and kept our drinks filled and made sure we were doing okay regularly. We ordered the mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto with mushrooms and bread crumbs appetizer. AMAZING! I got the manicotti for my meal. ANOTHER AMAZING dish. My boyfriend ordered their smoke salmon. I do not like fish so I did not care for it but my boyfriend said it was fantastic. Got to take the word of a fish eater. We then went there recently for a date. We got the same appetizer again and it was still great! We also shared a pizza. Their pizza was cooked in a brick oven and came out tasting better than most places we usually go to ie: native new yorker, venezia's, nypd. Prices are amazing and I would really like to try the desserts next time but I am always so full when I am finished eating!  Lets just say I would give this place a million stars and we will be back many times!

Pretty decent for a bagel place. I think maybe even better than Einsteins. However, I would like more cream cheese next time so I think I'll ask for extra next time I go! I got the Wildcat with no tomato. Their bacon was great! Also, the girl up front was sweet and also got checked out by the owner. He was cool. Was sad to see the one on Alma School and Ocotillo go. Didn't know there was another location! Will be coming back (:

Only giving 4 stars because my parents love the place. Personally, I'd give it a 3. Not too impressed, could be better

Pretty decent place actually, wasn't too impressed with their salad but my grandmother's Philly was great! I'd like to try their breakfast next!

Sad to see bad reviews. Probably one of the best nail spas I've been to in chandler. Kim does the best pedicures, I mean, she takes care of my in-grown toe nails! I don't know another nail place that does that. I wouldn't recommend getting a callous remover. That's one of the downsides. But other then that, I really like this place

So I've been here 3 times already and plan on going again today for lunch. I've been for lunch twice and dinner once. The lunches were the best and when I went to dinner with family, it wasn't the same and didn't taste very good which is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. I always get the Pad See Ew. It's amazing. I'm not a fan of spicy food either so this just hits the nail on the head. The sticky mango rice for dessert is also delish! This place is definitely worth a shot to check out. Just for lunch though ;)

What an awful company! Like previous reviewers, they do not return phone calls or listen to them for that matter. My grandmother has been trying to get a hold of them for 3 days now. I mean, it's a good thing this isn't an emergency or anything. I feel bad for all others who have emergencies that aren't addressed properly

Amazing food! Get the Pot stickers and the chicken and broccoli dish! Probably close to my favorite Chinese food place next to my house! (: I recommend trying them!

Well, after reading all the great reviews and hearing a lot about this place, I was so excited to eat here for lunch yesterday! I got chili cheese fries, and a plain ole' hotdog. My daughter got an order of the chicken nuggets. I wasn't really impressed by any of the food I had ordered. I'm really picky about my hotdogs and I was kind of grossed out by how thick they were. I'm used to the dodger dog styled ones, not Chicago style. That turned me off for the rest of my meal. My bun was really soggy and my hot dog kept falling out of it and that just pissed me off. The chili fries were also really runny. Not sure if they make their own chili but it was defiantly too runny for my liking. And last but not least, my daughters chicken nuggets tasted like a bucket of salt was dumped all over them. And don't get me wrong, I put salt on everything, I LOVE salt, but even that amount of salt was too much for me! I just really wasn't impressed by this place. Ill be sticking to wienershnitzle

Excellent food :) the pad see iew was great! The owner is a very nice man as well. Will be back. Only issue I had was the chicken. It definitely tastes funky. Like reheated chicken.

Sorry for the long post but I'm going to talk about my whole experience with this place just so everyone is clear on the experiences I have had here. One of the downfalls is that its way up in North Scottsdale and I live in South East Chandler, so the drive is horrendous, especially during rush hour traffic which seems to be the only time they have open appointments, don't blame others who don't want to make appointments at that time. Not to mention they seem to be booked up with appointments almost 2 months in advance now which is also very frustrating but I guess it could be good for them since they're getting business. Had issues with their billing department. They billed my insurance for two surgeries which ended up costing $32,000 total. Not sure why they billed the insurance twice. The staff is awesome, except for one person. She doesn't know what the hell she's doing and should not be working there by any means. The first time I had this woman, she filled my band and then decided to RIP the hooked needle out of my stomach, causing horrible burning feeling. I am not a crier unless I am in major pain and I have to say that I cried for a good 10 minutes because it hurt so badly. Maria, is the best though! She hits my port every time I get a fill. The other gal misses every time and has to go get Maria to do her job. Last time I went, I was stuck with a needle four because she didn't know where my port was located and then she over filled my band to the point where I had massive heartburn every day and couldn't eat solid food at all. I just went today and this time when I went I had to get fluid removed. I asked for Maria but was denied my request and got stuck with the person I don't like. She stuck me three times this round and still couldn't do it so she went got Maria. Low and behold, Maria was in and out with a needle in a matter of seconds which is why I love her so much! Then I get home and find I'm bleeding out of my bandage. Every time I go, it is a hit or miss on who I get as a nurse but I would definitely recommend Maria every time you go. I wouldn't really recommend this place, I'm sure there's better out there. The only reason I am still going is because of Maria and the only reason why I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1.

First, the owner came about 10 mintues after opening to unlock the doors and the girl rushed through my entire gel manicure. I think I spent an entire 20 min there. Other places take about 45 min to an hour. My nails look like complete shit and I will never come back,  super disappointed. Dont come here, ever! Go to Nails by Susan across the street, they do a way better job!

For all the hype, I didn't find the burgers to be too great. Been to this location once and the one at Tempe Marketplace. Both are the same and I still do not care to eat here. I would rather eat at Five Guys!

No, just NO! Went here for lunch a few days ago, it was gross! The sesame chicken was mushy and had NO flavor, the pork fried rice was sweet and the egg drop soup had no flavor either. Had to drench everything in soy sauce just for taste. I would never go back here!

I will start off on a bad note! I live 2 miles from this location and ordered food from here for pick up. The person I spoke to said it would be ready for pick up in 20 minutes. So surely I was there 20 minutes on the dot and had my cousin run in for me and pick up the food and the girl at the to-go counter was super rude and unfriendly. Then when we got the food home, everything was completely soggy and cold! It seemed like the pizza was sitting around for about 2 hours, the wings were atrocious and the hot gravy sandwich and fries were also soggy! I've been here many times and love coming here to eat because their food is so good! I was so disappointed that I went to their website and wrote them a complaint about how disappointed I was in there service and that I regret spending $40 on nasty food. The manager called me up two days later apologizing for the mishap and promised that something like this never happens. So, she sent me a $50.00 gc in the mail for all my trouble. I was thankful for that and my cousin and I went back to dine-in and the food was super good as usual. Crispy wings, good appetizers and pizza. I was pleased!

I went here last night with my grandma, two cousins and my 3 year old daughter. I had a blast, minus some of the rude staff, expensive prices, and hate to say it, but gross food! I'm not sure what everyone else got on here that was so amazing but I was severely disappointed. The pizza was bland, the chicken "tenders" were like frozen chicken nuggets that you defrost in the microwave. Not what I was expecting. The only reason I gave it a 2 star instead of a 1 is because I had a lot of fun watching my daughter have fun! Some of the staff were very friendly and helpful, and others were very rude and seemed like their social life was more important then working, probably because 99% of the people working there were Perry high schoolers. I probably wont be going back unless its for bowling only since there isn't a close enough bowling alley to me, sadly!

OH MY GOSH!!!!! I just tried Five Guys for the first time this week and I must say that I am absolutely in LOVE with this place. They have the best burgers I have ever eaten in my life! My family and I got it to-go so the fries were kind of wimpy when we got it home but I don't even care because the burger totally made up for it! I wish there was a little more seating for people with to-go orders too but I did not mind standing. I will be back for sure!

Very surprised to see all these fantastic reviews, which is why I'm highly disappointed. The reason I came was because of the reviews. The food was not good. Had pad see iew for lunch and I couldn't believe the flavor of it. I mean, what flavor? It was hardly tasty and even when I did taste anything, it was way too sweet, which is normally not like that at other places. Also, the roll you get during lunch was just veggies shoved in a rice paper roll. No bueno. I also tried the mango rice. Why is it green?! Freaked me out to be honest. All and all, I wouldn't come back. Super bummed :(

This place is a disaster. Food was horrible and service was worse! For what you pay, you might as well go to native or b-dubs for wings! They need a whole new set of staff because clearly everyone thinks it's better to chit chat then do their jobs. So disappointed

Sad to see this place only has 3 and 1/2 stars. The barbacoa (sp?) pork is to die for! I get it in a cheese quesadilla! Would totally eat it as my last meal on Earth if it came down to it ;D

This place is so awesome and my 4 year old daughter loves it! The one thing I do not like is all the hiding places. Its hard to find your kids unless you're with them 24/7. Haha other than that, it's a perfect place to let your kids run wild and free!

Burger was okay but certainly not worth the price I paid and it did not even include a drink or a side. Disappoint to say the least. Won't be going back

This place was great! I assume because it's still brand new is why it's so clean. Pizza was actually really great! Got a large thin crust with pepperoni! Better then some places around here haha. I'd definitely go back! I also like that each game is only ONE token
