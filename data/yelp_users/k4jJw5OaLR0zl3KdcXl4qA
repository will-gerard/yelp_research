You definitely get what you pay for. I took everyone's advice and showed up to get my puppies vaccinated at 5:45 a.m.This part was actually the best part of my whole experience seeing as I was first in line. I had to take my 4 young kids with me because my husband works very early in the morning. The clinic opened at 6:15 and we really didn't have to wait very long to be seen. As soon as I was taken back I was promptly told that my children could not touch anything or move around at all. ok, fair enough. I wasn't planning on letting them trash the place. Then the dr commented on the fact that I should have brought four more leashes. I want to mention that my kids were doing absloutly nothing wrong. They were honest to goodness just standing there. My daughter mentioned that they were mainly out door dogs. The dr snapped at me asking why we even had dogs. I assured her they were inside quite a bit as well. Then I mentioned she seemed crabby. She apologized ( kind of) and said she just wasn't used to children. Well, welcome to the public lady. Kids are a part of life.   I asked a question about the frequency of the shots and she looked at me like I was an idiot and said she had just told me the answer. obviously not well enough because I was still confused.   Over all the price is right and if you get there by 5:45 the wait is not so bad. But the customer service is awful. I will not be going back.

This place is decent. It could use more seating for parents. My only other complaint would be that it needs more inflatables for a open bounce. I used a groupon but if I would have paid any more I might be ticked. But my kids had fun and it was clean. We will be back!

I have been trying to schedule a breast MRI for over four months. The first time I tried I asked for an open MRI I was told their baywood location had one. The next day they called back that baywood did not have one and they rescheduled me to come in on a different day that did not work for me. This was after waiting on hold for over 45 mins. When I called back to reschedule a few weeks later I waited on hold again for over 20 mins to be told the computers were down?!   I called back a few weeks after that. I only waited on hold for 6 mins and was able to make an appt finally!  I was also told the test needed to be 10-14 days after my period and no caffeine for 24 hours before the test! The person I scheduled with the first time NEVER told me that!   So I skip my coffee come in this morning and am taken right back. The breast MRI is about 20 mins and if you are claustrophobic very nerve wracking. I got about 20 mins into the test ( I was so happy I was almost done and this was almost all behind me) when the tech comes in and tells me the machine is broken!!!!!! None of the images they have are useable!!   After fighting back tears I go for my mammogram. The tech can't find my name and I wait for about 15 mins. Finally I get in there. Now I will say that she was obviously new and that's ok, people have to learn. But she did keep repeatedly saying "Jesus" every time she got frustrated.   This whole place is unprofessional and I am very frustrated.

Finally! Some place gets it!! A reasonably priced air conditioned play place where everyone from my 15 year old to my three year old can have fun. They have staff supervising every area as well as comfy couches and fast wifi for mom and dad. We will definitely be back!
