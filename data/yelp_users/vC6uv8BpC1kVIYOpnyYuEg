Love this animal clinic ! I have been going to Arizona Avenue Animal Clinic for over 7 years . I wouldn't trust any one else with my two boys . They truly care about their patients and are affordable. Dr. Christina and Dr.Mike are my favorite and the techs are really knowledgeable and friendly .   Thank you Arizona Avenue for taking such good care of my pets !

I recently visited a Wal-Mart because I got a flat tire. When I arrived it was 10 min till 7 and the Auto Department was closing. I was told that I needed to come back tomorrow to get my tire fixed. Upset I started to franticly call my husband to see if there was another place I could get a new tire. Bob saw this and walked up to me and said "Looks like your upset, what's the matter? " So I told Bob that I was just frustrated because I work and don't know when I would be able to get my tire fixed and that my husband just called and it wasn't a problem and now I am being told I am too late. Then Bob went back and talked to the guys and said to bring my car to the back and they will get it fixed up for me. Bob is so kind and sweet. He did not need to help me out, but he did. He went out of his way to make sure a customer was happy. He treated me like family and that's what good customer service is about. I am so grateful that he came to the rescue. I hope that by doing this he gets the recognition he deserves because of him I am not driving on a doughnut. Thank you Bob you made my day !!!  Store # 5186  2501 S. Market Street  Gilbert AZ 85295

I wish I could give zero stars !!!  I visited this office for a routine annual exam to renew my Birth Control prescription . I had to wait over an hour before I was seen by Jenny ! From the moment she had walked in the room she was not pleasant with me she was extremely rude while I was telling her my medical history constantly snapping back with rude remarks. She was generally demeaning throughout the whole exam . She then told me that she was going to change my Birth control to a pill, and I told her that unfortunately I had many issues while on any pill form of birth control including irregular menstrual cycle lasting months at a time , nausea , vomiting , and extreme mood changes. and have not had any of these problems while using Nuvaring. She insisted that I change. I was uncomfortable with this so I decided to get a second opinion somewhere else. I got up, grabbed my cloths and went into the bathroom inside the exam room to change. While in the bathroom she came after me slamming the door open crushing me in between the back wall and the door . She did not apologize and had no medical reason to be in that bathroom ! I left the office shaking and crying in complete shock.She abused her power and authority and I am concerned for any other woman that she may injure.    Please don't go to this office !!!!     They are rude and only want your money even after all that they sent me a bill for my copay that I am still trying to work out with them and It has been over 2 weeks !

It was a sigh of relief when I walked in to the lobby  .I had just had a horrible experiance at another practice and made the change to Valley Women for Women . The staff was extreamly kind ! I had brought a book because I was expecting a long wait but I didn't even have time to sit down before they called my name. The nurse I saw, Kellea Danuser, was so understanding and I felt extremely comfortable being under her care ! I am so glad I made the change !!! Valley Women for Women really care about their paitents !!!!   I want to thank all of the staff for the great care they provided!!!!

One of the best Sushi Restaurants my husband  and I have been too !!! The sushi was fresh ,the portions where huge , We had gone during happy hour and After getting our bill we where shocked on how inexpensive it was !  Drinks  Yellow Tail Nigiri Vegas roll  Philly Roll  Edamame and a seaweed salad  all under 17 bucks !!!!   And did I tell you how good the service was ?  our server Briana was quick with  our drinks never leaving our glasses empty and had our food out before I could finish my seaweed salad !!! After finishing our meal  we had at least 12 employees say thank you as we walked out the door !!!   Really RA you better watch out this place is amazing !!!!!!!!   Thank you Kanpai staff for such a great experience !!!!

When you have a toddler appointments can be a bit stressful ... thankfully Kidtastic seems to understand this . Walked in and was signed in right away. The waiting room had a ton of different activities from a table with toys on it , books and a kids  movie  playing he was entertained . We barely had time to  play  with a toy before  they called him back . Not only was everyone friendly, but I didn't feel rushed as they let my almost 2 year old explore his surroundings.  The assistant was great she brought in a tooth brush just in case he needed distraction. . They also had a movie playing over the dental chair so cool ! Thankfully my little guy did not fuss at all and felt extremely informed after the appointment . The Dr. didn't seem to mind my billion questions regarding his teeth in 10 years (hahaha I tend to get ahead of my self ) He was amazing with my dude and   he seemed to be comfortable with him !   Plus after they get a token and  pick out a toy !!   Amazing Place they get kids and mom's too !
