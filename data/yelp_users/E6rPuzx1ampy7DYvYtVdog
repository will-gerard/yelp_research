Used to come here as a kid and had to visit again to see if it was still as good.  Seems like they've replaced the famous breadsticks with chips/salsa- but I'm not complaining- the chips were really yummy- sort of a sweet taste to them.  Wine selection was decent, waiter was a sweet heart too- he let us know pets are welcome to join you on the patio too- something about "Paws on the Patio", so if you're an animal lover it's a great place to bring the puppy.  Reminded me of the smaller sidewalk places off the pier in South Bay where everyone always brought their dogs.  As for food- we had the fajitas- very good- the steak wasn't overcooked like a lot of places tend to do, word of advice though- not good as left overs so make sure you bring your appetite and finish them there!  :)  Looking forward to going again- this time for margaritas!

Love love love this place.  Total neighborhood coffee shop vibe, great coffee, nothing overpriced, and my personal fav- big variety in the pastry department- every time I go it seems like there's a different selection of yummy stuff to chose from!   Super friendly baristas, and this place is always busy- the corporate business scene early in the AM, post-yoga class moms mid-morning, the study crowd in the afternoons, and a bit of a social scene if you catch it on the right night (esp. with G-spot right next door!).   There's free wifi, and a cozy yet open back patio with great views of Camelback- perfect because there's always seating and it's covered for shade (or in case of rain!).

Came here because we had a gift certificate from an online deal- very hard to find tucked back between two buildings in the corner of the shopping center. The staff members are rude to eachother and loud so you can hear them even when they're back in the kitchen- really kills atmosphere. Sat at our table for 5-10 minutes before we were greeted (waitress did apologize for leaving us sitting there so long).  I liked the edamame, miso soup & tempura were pretty good, but the main course (beef teriyaki & sushi) were average at best which is not saying much for a sushi place. Restaraunt was dirty inside, thick layers of dust on almost anything you looked at- all light fixtures, booths, walls, wood trim... makes you wonder how clean the kitchen is if they don't clean the places you _do_ actually see. Highlight was our waitress, very knowledgeable about the menu, and very sweet & genuine, if not for her, this probably would've been a 1 star.

Not a fan. Seating is pretty bad- either on the "outdoor patio" (freezing, very few heaters, lots of people smoking, overlooking the driveway to the mall garage with cars driving through the entire time) or inside (smells wierd, tables placed awkwardly, people walking through the mall stare at you while you're eating)...  Service was awful, super slow, at least 20 minutes before he asked to take our order...  Brought out drinks at different times (c'mon guys, there were only 2 of us...).  Maybe their staff is holding out- saving up the impressive service for Valentine's weekend?  Either way, won't be eating there again.  Ick.

TERRIBLE.  Don't waste your time.  My husband called these guys to fix our dishwasher 3 days before a big dinner party.  We both rushed home from work to meet the scheduled technician at 5:30; the tech never showed up!  My husband called the company, and someone who called himself a "scheduling guy" answered a cell phone, super abrupt- said he was too busy in the line at the bank to help coordinate the details and pretty much hung up on my husband.  My husband thought they were disconnected, called the guy back, only to hear the guy call him "rude" for interrupting his time at the bank, my husband apologized, and they guy said it was too late and he was cancelling our appointment.  Seriously?  Your company no-shows at a job, insults customers, and then cancels our appointment??  Wow.

Had  areally fun time here with a big group after Spring Training! Big long tables in thse bar are great for big groups- simple menu worked for vegetarians in our group too. Sangria was so-so, but that's what I get for ordering it when I should have had a margarita!

We love going to this place with our family! We have two kids and they're always very accommodating they help with high chairs and finding a place for us to sit.  We love their desserts and their potato bacon soup and BLTs are the best.  We always have to get fresh brewed iced teas too.  On the weekends we usually get breakfast here- husband likes the Taylor ham sandwich, great place for families.  I have no idea why anyone would give this place a bad review.

LOVE working with this company.  My husband and I have quite a few rental properties as well as residential property "flips" and work with Carpet World at least once every couple weeks.  They take the time to do things right, they fit us in the schedule last minute all the time, and if there are ever issues (rare)- they are quick to make things right.  They are very honest- once we paid them twice for the same check and right away they called to write us a refund!  Great quality carpet, professional installers.  Highly recommend!

We LOVE our groomers Arizona's Per Stylist!   The dogs get groomed in a special trailer right in our driveway- a million times easier than trying to get two dogs and a toddler to/from a groomer.  We are very loyal to our regular stylist Jaymie but when she was out sick they were able to send a backup and kept our appointment- so now we also love Sue! We have a mini golden doodle who likes to swim in the pool so we keep her fur pretty short and our other dog is a long haired chihuahua-Pomeranian mix so we keep his fur short too in the summer. The dogs get bows or bandanas, a special "paw-gress" report that notes any special conditions and cleanliness of their teeth, and then a homemade cookie treat at the end of the grooming.  Highly recommend!  They also give discounts for Facebook posts of your dogs and referral credits so if you like them once you get started you can refer your friends. There is also a multiple-dog discount so it's a better deal if you have a couple pets being groomed at once.

Really cute place!  Great atmosphere- we see the owner almost every time we're there.  Menu is simple and good.  We get the breakfast sandwhich and ice lattes or ice mochas every time.  Most of the time the food is really great, only every once in a blue moon they must have a substitute cook who is not as good as the normal one.  Usually we have breakfast here on weekends!  Highly recommend!

Awesome breakfast spot! Love the area! They have super fast service and great food- it's always packed on the weekends but it never takes long to get seated. We enjoy the outdoor scenery and fountains while we wait- it's always fun to people watch too. As for food- the pancakes are obviously great and I love the waffles with strawberries and cream or even just a simple order of bacon eggs and pancakes- you can't go wrong!

Cooper is great! He worked with me to implement a design that was functional and looked great too. We ended up deciding to get two gate panels and it made accessing the pool so much easier! We also installed a section that can be "rolled back" when we want easy open access to the pool. Two years after the install one of the gate latches wasn't lining up properly and within a couple days he was out fixing it at no charge. Great service, very professional! Highly recommend.

We come here for lunch all the time and we love it! The iced tea is fresh brewed and I love the huge cups- great value. We use their punch cards and get free stuff all he time because we are here about once a week. My husband really likes the French dip with mashed potatoes, I usually get a French dip with veggies. Our daughter also enjoys the kids meal- it's a great deal and comes with Mac and cheese, teddy grahm crackers and apple sauce! If you use the check in feature on the yelp app they will give ou a free cookie!

Must have been a very off night for this place... Walked in and told them it was our first time in- we live in the neighborhood and were looking forward to giving this place a try- super sarcastic hostess says, "yeah we are pretty awesome". Umm ok. So we asked for table of 5 plus a high chair, took them about 10 minutes to figure out they couldn't seat us for at least an hour, hostess was so rude- said they don't normally seat parties of more than 4 (what!?). Walked out front to find three empty 4-top tables, walked back in to hostess and asked if they could push two together and she told me that's not their policy and she would have to ask a manager- even more attitude from her now- I let her know I would like to speak to the manager at this point. He turns out to be even less help than her. We explained we lived up the street etc, he seems like he could care less. Just a side note here- we are a clean cut married couple- dressed casual but nice- late twenties with a beautiful little blondie baby and we literally live two seconds from here. So bummed at how lame this place turned out to be. Won't be back. Last thing- we decided to eat at ha humble pie instead, turned out to be happy hour still and we were seated right away either amazing service as usual and great food.

Highly recommend. Had them out to look at a couple of our Viking appliances before we host a big Thanksgiving dinner next week. Justin was quick, professional and knowledgable. He worked us into his schedule and even gave me a warning call on his way so our barking dogs wouldn't wake up my napping toddler! He was able to figure out the problem on our range and also fixed our temperamental ice dispenser. His tools were neat and organized; he wore a professional uniform with his name embroidered- I felt very comfortable with him in my home. He also gave me some tips on basic maintenance I should do to keep my appliances working well! We are also having him look at a gas dryer at our rental property as well.

Came here because of the positive reviews on yelp. Nice and clean inside, big flat screen tv with the football game on, staff was helpful with ordering- I was picking up wings for a party so wanted to get crowd pleasers. There are TONS of flavors to chose from. They included ranch at no cost and my order was ready fast! I had an iced tea while I waited which was only a couple minutes. Noticed they had not one not two but THREE flavors of koolaide in drink machines- fun. Wings were great too- we would come back next time we're in the area.
