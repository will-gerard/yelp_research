I've been to this location about three or four times and have received service ranging from okay to excellent.  The manager (and head chef) has dropped by nearly every time I've been there to see how things are and the host staff has always been polite.  Today we had a booth in the bar area, although we had sodas with our meal.  We shared an appetizer, some spinach fondutu (sp?) thing that was a little runny and slightly oversalted, though still tasty.  It came out with some buttered Italian toast pieces, but there weren't enough of them to eat the fondutu because it was so soupy, so we ended up sopping up some of it with the complimentary bread they always provide.  I ordered parmesan-crusted arugula chicken with a side of some pasta I couldn't pronounce (it was the best meal I've ever had there--I wish it weren't a seasonal special!); my boyfriend ordered steak marsala (he said it was good, but not amazing).  Both of our meals came with salads.  I had a birthday coupon which took my $17 meal off of the tab and our total was about $37 after that had been removed.  What really impressed me this time around was the service.  Before we went, I tried to print out my birthday coupon but had technical issues.  I called the restaurant and they said I could forward the email and they'd print it out there for me, which I thought was really nice of them.  When we got there I let them know that I had sent the email, but the manager told me that they hadn't received it.  He proceeded to tell me that he would take care of comping the meal anyway, and didn't make it a hassle in any way.  Our waitress (Victoria--she's an awesome server!) also brought me out a little sundae thing that was prettily done in a shot glass.  All in all, today was the best experience I've ever had at Carraba's, which is why I decided to write them up here when I got home.  There are two reasons I gave them four stars instead of five.  First is that in the evening the place gets really loud, particularly the bar area.  I don't know whether it's due to poor acoustics or if people just get loud when they eat Italian food, but I've left there with a headache a couple times.  The second reason is that the service isn't always as phenomenal as it was today.  We went in for a super-early dinner (at about 4 pm), and I think it was slow enough that we got some extra attention; when we usually go later in the evening (around 7 or 8 pm) the servers are a little more harried and less helpful.

All the Seattle Espressos consistently impress me.  The clerks are knowledgeable without being snobs, the interior is chill without being dirty, and the coffee is amazing without being expensive.  The menu offers a full host of espresso- and coffee-based drinks, plus four iced teas per day and a huge selection of hot teas that they will ice down for you.  They will also make Italian sodas with or without cream, and offer the usual kid-friendly drinks like hot chocolate and fruit juices.  My favorite order is an iced Americano, and Seattle Espresso is the only place I've found one that's so smooth I don't need to pollute it with milk.  Each drink is made with as many shots as you specify, and comes in whichever size you choose.  Pricing is incredibly reasonable: right now I'm drinking a quadruple shot of iced espresso that came to $3.37 with tax.  Illy espresso is sold by the pound, and they market a number of high-quality coffee presses, grinders, and brewers; you can purchase Torani flavored syrups by the bottle and whole-leaf teas by the ounce; and the usual cutesy mugs and coffee accessories are displayed tastefully on a small counter to the side, rather than shoved down your throat in an effort to force you into impulse purchases.  One of my favorite things about Seattle is that if you walk in and they haven't had a customer in a while, they grind fresh beans for your order, tossing the ones that were ground an hour ago and have lost flavor.  All locations offer free WEP wi-fi and are camper-friendly.  Usually the employees have one or two friends who are in the store and hanging out, but I have never been ignored by an employee who was finishing a conversation or something.  All in all, this is hands-down my favorite coffee shop in the Phoenix Metro area.  I also highly recommend the other locations, as I have visited most of them and never been disappointed.

I've been here twice, both times alone for lunch.  Both times I sat at the sushi bar and received phenomenal service from the owner, Sake.  He suggested great rolls and talked my ear off, which I didn't mind when I was sitting alone.  I liked the sushi because it was fresh and different, and I liked that the owner was there and enthusiastic about the place.  I mentioned a few other local sushi places and he was very classy about them--he didn't have anything negative to say about anybody else or try to tell me his place was the best on Earth.  He also listened to what I had to say about each roll I tried, and made a suggestion based on my feedback for the next time I went in, and suggested that I come in with a few girlfriends for ladies' night.  Some sushi places bring you out a little salad or some miso soup (or both) before your meal, but not here.  After I finished my meal I got a cute little scoop of strawberry ice cream with a fortune cookie pressed into it.  The bathroom was fairly clean, but old and had dingy fixtures.  The wait staff service was polite, but not horribly prompt or friendly.  The lights in the dining area were dim enough to partially hide the fact that the whole place could use a good deep cleaning.  The reason I gave Temari four stars instead of five is the cleanliness of the place.  The sushi bar was immaculate and Sake was definitely cleaning as he went behind the counter, but I was not impressed with the dinginess of the dining area or the bathroom.  Despite this, I will definitely be back.

I get the ambiance and could even buy into it, but I have to say that I am consistently unimpressed by Oregano's. The portions are huge and are almost good, but I find everything on the menu to be oversalted. Service is ALWAYS slow, there's ALWAYS a wait, and it's one of those creepy chains where all the employees look like they've had their smiles screwed onto their faces with a corporate power-drill. Someone's putting something in the Kool-Aid.  Every once in a while, I would get a craving for a salad or some pasta and I'd go in, but I have never been back to one since I was in this location one evening just before they closed. The servers were cleaning some booths as part of the end of their shift. A girl pulled the bench of one booth back and a grapefruit-sized clump of white maggots dropped to the floor, squirming everywhere. I have no idea what they were eating, but I have never seen that many maggots in one place, let alone in a clump like that. This, in itself, is horrifying enough.... however, what I found disturbing was that none of the servers seemed especially shocked or surprised. The manager came over and comped something off our bill, but the experience was truly horrifying.  I will not eat in any Oregano's again.... that level of filth is unacceptable in any food service establishment.

I just got a job teaching less than a mile from this little restaurant and I was THRILLED to discover it today!  Walking through the door, the place looks rather cramped: 1 four-top, 3 two-tops, and a long counter with about 10 seats on each side. The woman at the counter was polite, though not overly friendly.  I ordered a salmon salad and spicy tuna roll combo with an iced green tea (drinks were self-serve; take-out cup was provided at no extra charge). My salad was served in less than five minutes and I had not finished it when the roll came out.  The tea was freshly brewed and they had three different types to choose from, which made me happy.  My salad was nothing exciting, although the dressing tasted homemade and all the ingredients were very fresh (pet peeve: sifting through my salad for brown lettuce). What really sold me on the place, though, was the sushi. Spicy tuna is generally bland and unexciting, plus the fish is overworked... It's sort of a training bra for people who are not quite ready for real raw fish, but who have graduated from California rolls.  This, though, was perfect: the tuna was minced, but still cold and not pulpy; the spice came from raw jalapenos; and they added some cucumber slices, a really nice touch.  The restaurant looked very clean; tables were bused very promptly and were set up appealingly for the next customers. The woman at the counter stopped her conversation immediately when I approached to ask for more wasabi, and all of the employees said goodbye when I left. I will DEFINITELY be back to Cafe Wasabi.

This is just about the best hole-in-the-wall I've found since moving to the Southeast Valley last fall.  It's small, with seating for about forty inside and aother fifteen outside.  Service is attentive and friendly.  Menu is written by the owner, who has been a cook since before I was born. :)  Substitutions are not a problem and, unlike most small places, they don't nickel-and-dime you for stuff like a side of ranch.  I very highly recommend this place, particularly their Spaniard omelet.

I love walking in to this place.  Four people yell at you in Japanese.  I have no idea what they're saying (for all I know, it could be something like "Get out, white devils!"), but it's fun and exciting and makes you feel welcome.  Furnishings are tasteful, in an IKEA sort of way.  Lights are indirect--bright bulbs shone through red and purple paper umbrellas.  The walls are covered with Polaroids of people who have fulfilled some specific requirement, but I've never worked out what exactly the requirement is, despite having ended up on the wall myself on two separate occasions.  Windows are hung with fabric prints of Japanese art.  Tables are straight out of the business IKEA catalog--the leather chairs are super-comfortable, but avoid the wooden high-top chairs at all costs!  Environment is more casual and restaurant-y than somewhere like RA, but I feel a little out-of-place when I'm drinking a soda here.  I usually order one of their modestly priced sake bombs or Japanese beers.  The sushi here is amazing.  They have this cool happy hour menu that has half-and-half rolls separated by price.  The full menu has whole rolls, but I've never even cracked it because I like to get the half-and-halves for two reasons: first, if I'm being cheap-o one night, I know which side of the menu to inspect; second, I get to try several different things, even when I only go with one or two other people.  The rolls themselves are always well-prepared and wrapped tightly, but served with a minimal amount of presentation.  Rolls tend to be too big for one bite, so if you're still on training wheels with chopsticks, I recommend asking for a fork.  I have ordered two cooked items (other than tempura sushi rolls): chicken teriyaki and beef yakisoba.  The nicest word I could use for the chicken teriyaki would be "bland."  I didn't taste the beef yakisoba until after someone else had doused it with soy sauce, but the one bite I had convinced me never again to order something cooked from their menu.  Honestly, it's never a problem anyway because I'm so nuts for the sushi.  Service is average-to-lousy.  Waitresses are sweet and polite, but really not very good at waitressing.  You'll wait ten minutes to get your drink and another ten to place your order; refills are free for non-alcoholic beverages (including their tasty iced green tea), but to get one you'll probably have to get up out of your seat to flag down an employee.  Before you order drinks, you're presented with a small bowl of fresh lettuce with Asian dressing (they call it "salad," but it's just bagged iceburg lettuce with no other ingredients) and another small bowl of miso.  These are included in the price, as is the little peacock you receive with your check at the end of the meal.  The peacock is made from an apple, an orange, some whipped cream, and a few chocolate-dipped sesame sticks.  All in all, I recommend this place very highly for a casual dining experience.  It would be a great place to bring some out-of-town friends or relatives who like fresh Japanese cuisine.  It's not bar-y enough for happy hour, but it's a little too bar-y for me to ever consider taking in kids.  It's a little too noisy for a first date, but for an average night out with some friends it's perfect.
