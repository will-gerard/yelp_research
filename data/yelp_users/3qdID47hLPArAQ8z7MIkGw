After hearing great things about the steaks for several years we chose to go to Shula's on a Monday night. Thought was Monday would be a slower night there and we wouldn't be rushed.  Started out great, got right in without a reservation! Seated us in a nice corner booth.  Server went over the menu and showed the steak samples. We selected the $59 special which seemed to be a deal. Appetizer ordered was the calamari - real good and enough for 4 people. Then there was a long wait with nothing going on. My water was getting refilled seemed like every time someone walked by, but my wife's tea was empty the entire meal. Finally refilled when she set it on the edge of the table. (This was about the time we had finished the meal. )Then a large party showed up (which the waitress had mentioned) and it seemed like the attention to serve us dropped from a 7 to about a 2 on the 10 scale.   Still waiting!!   And then.... Our meal shows up!!   WHAT ABOUT THE SALADS?   We asked the waitress? Oh, you didn't get your salads she responded! No waitress we didn't get the salads. At which time she asked - do you want me to bring them now? NO! To late! She really didn't respond like a upper end establishment waitress should respond. Ran off like she was going to talk to management , manager did show up and acted like he wasn't aware of the SALAD issue. He reviewed the special flyer for the special and said he would make an adjustment on the bill.   Yes- there was an adjustment BUT we will never return to this place. Service really did suck! And the big party bill was more important then our little order of 2 specials. I also feel since we never order alcohol drinks we get slighted on good service as the waiters start to tally this isn't going to be a big bill since the alcohol is absent from the total bill!  DONE! Not going back!

Absolutely terrible ! Sunday afternoon with really no crowd. Took over 30 minutes for wing order to be served. Thought waitress passed out or left the building since she didn't come back to refill my tea for another 15 minutes after wings were served. While eating my business appointment showed up and ordered a salad from my waitress. Said she would put the order in but was leaving and cashed my tab out. He finally got up to talk to management after 30 minute wait for a salad. Finds out the order was never placed by the retiring first waitress. Salad took another 20 minutes to finally be served. No management or new server really cared to say sorry or comp some of the charges . When we left several waitresses were sitting on the counter by the front lobby! Might have been nap time because the service sucked! One and done in going back to this site.

After a bad experience with another eye doctor, I found Dr. McMullen and can't say enough great things about him. If you are looking for an eye doctor for life then this is your guy!! Great attitude and takes the time to explain what you need to know about the results of the tests.
