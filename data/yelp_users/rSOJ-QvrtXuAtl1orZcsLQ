We stayed at El Cortez for 2 nights just to stay near Fremont but we had a few issues. The room was hot. Ridiculously hot even after attempting to turn on and off the fan or change the temperature and we had to call for service. But in order to call for service I had to walk down to the table and talk to someone in guest services because hey, the phone doesn't work in the room. It was then the man behind the table notified me that "there's no way you can call on a Saturday night. You'll never get through." Which is cool, however it's an internal telephone system in 2015 there is 0 reason someome shouldn't be able to use the phone in their room. What if there had been a medical emergency and I couldn't use the phone? This is not only hazardous but super inconvenient.   In the room the bathroom toilet handle has to be held down so the toilet will flush be  prepared to wait there while you flush.   When gambling also be prepared to have no one ask if you want drinks. Saturday nights are the worst. We waited almost 2 hours and no one asked. Even after switching sections or attempting to get someone attention. They seem to be extremely understaffed in that department.  There was also an issue with my check in because I went through kayak instead of their direct site. For some the database didn't update with my check in or reservation. We waited 20mins before being checked in because they couldn't find it.  All in all, our Vegas trip was awesome and Fremont is loads funner than "the new strip", the AC was fixed, but the phone issue and the reservation difficulties weren't enjoyable.

I went in last week for some work on my car. Turns out it was some in need of some serious repairs. The staff here got me check in really quickly, gave me an ETA on when they would be able to check out the car & a ride to work. They were super communicative and called to keep me updated on the repairs. Since it was going to take a few days, they offered me a loaner which was a HUGE help!  The staff was polite, personable & knowledgeable. Those three don't always combine in any service based field but these people really had it down.  In addition to the chill atmosphere at the place and the loaner, there was financing available and that was a major plus especially when dealing with a major car repair like the one I had done.   I would highly recommend 180 Degrees Auto to anyone looking to have a positive and timely car repair experience.

Came here to get my son's  hair done at 3:15pm. Online the hours say 4pm is when they close. We got there, the doors were locked, windows open so he obviously saw us and the barber waved us off and said no more. Rude.  I'd give it less than 1 star if i could based on shitty customer service.

When they say coffee and crepes they mean - coffee and crepes.  They have 2 specialities and they do it SO WELL!! I've tried 4 of the crepes so far and they're all wonderful. It's our new favorite spot for breakfast!
