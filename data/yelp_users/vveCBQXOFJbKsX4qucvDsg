Fantastic place for anyone with an interest in sewing. You can always get a good buy no matter what you're buying. Materials are insanely cheap in comparison to chain retail stores. The staff is friendly, though they might look a little mean sometimes, but they're always willing to help.

I had seen this place for months, and me and my friends finally stopped in for a try. It was pretty good! When you first walk in the doors it looks very modern. The menu is right behind the register in big print, you order, then sit down and wait to be served. The portions they give are fair to their prices (although the add-ons for the ramen are a little expensive) and you definitely feel full once you're done with your bowl. I tried the miso ramen and I enjoyed it. A couple things I didn't like; The boba tea. It's alright. I had gotten almond milk tea, and at first taste, it was weird. I could only taste the almonds and milk, hardly the tea, and the boba was very, very chewy. Eventually the drink grew on me a little more, but I have doubts on trying a milk tea again off their boba menu. Another thing, and this was just me personally- I had gotten miso ramen with tofu, but the tofu wasn't really satisfying. I was expecting the tofu to have warmed up and absorbed more of the miso flavor, however it was lukewarm, and just tasted like tofu. But thinking about this later, I realize that it's not miso soup with tofu already in it, they only put the tofu in when requested. But that was something I found a little disappointing. One final thing: I wasn't sure if I should tip or not. they bring out your food and take your plates away, but I hadn't seen anyone else in the restaurant tip, nor anyone at my table. I had tipped anyway, but I completely lost on whether I should have or not. This was actually very close to only getting 3 stars, but I'm giving it 4 with the benefit of the doubt that I'll try it again and like it even better next time.

I graduated from Marinello at the end of August 2010, and let me tell you, I was glad to get out of there. While the teachers were very knowledgeable in their trade, the program and administration is less than desirable. When I first toured the school and started classes in January, I was promised many things to learn, one of them being makeup classes. Still to this day they do not have those classes available at the school, and those were pretty big reasons to why I wanted to go there. There was also a lot of drama in the midst of my schooling there. Several administrators left, a teacher left, and they changed everything that we were used to. They started focusing on advertising instead of getting students product to use, and there was a lot of times when school product would go missing when they didn't go missing before the administration change. besides those things, the school is okay. At the very least, it will teach you what  you need to know to be an aesthetician in the state. But I definitely wouldn't go there again, and I definitely wouldn't recommend anybody to go there. Be sure to look around at other schools before you decide what's best for you.

I live right next to this sprouts and I love it!! I'm a vegetarian, so being right by a healthy grocery store is definitely a plus. Their deli sandwiches are delicious, and their produce prices are phenomenal. I don't shop for all of my food here, as most of it besides produce it is a little pricey, but its still one of my favorite places to shop.
