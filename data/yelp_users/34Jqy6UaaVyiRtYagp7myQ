I like to take my dog here for a walk on the weekends. It is a very nice walk around the lake. I was surprised the first time I went because the lake is HUGE, definitely bigger than I was expecting. The lake is stocked and you can fish and take home certain amounts of each type of fish. I saw someone's catfish they caught and it was huge! As someone mentioned there is often people fishing with there equipment and lines blocking the walkways. Also, most people are nice and friendly but there does seem to be some of the shadier variety of people at this park and certain parts of the lake have trash floating(but only a small portion). Just be sure to clean up after yourselves people!  It is definitely a nice change to just walking your dog around your neighborhood!

Love this park! It is huge and there is lots of room for my dog to run. They provide water fountains and buckets for the dogs and bags to clean up dog poo (sometimes people fail to clean their dog's poo up though but it may be because they are not paying attention). The people that bring their dogs to this park are friendly and I have not seen any problems with aggressive dogs here.

Love F&E!!! I can't buy everything I need there but they had the majority of what I need. I really like the discount section (it may be disorderly but it is a discount section)...always stock up on meat and freeze it.   Also, I like that I can bring my grocery bags there and they recycle them because we cannot recycle them through our service at home.   Make sure you sign up for the Friends card. You receive an email that always has an $8 off $40 coupon plus they are now sending you coupons based off of your purchases. I bought $72 worth of food (meat), mostly from the discount section, and with that coupon and a couple others I only paid $32. Can't beat that!!

I use this place every time I need a car wash. It is quick and the guys working are always nice and helpful. I was able (can't quite remember when last year) to spend $20 on a gift card and receive an additional $20. Pretty awesome! It is a great place to get a basic car wash!

This place was soooo good! Do not let the outside fool you...it is not what you would expect on the outside but the inside is just what you would expect a BBQ place to look like. Today was our first time trying it and the girl at the counter was very nice and offered us samples of the brisket. The meat was so good and tender. I am so happy we found this place down here in this area!.

Not the best dentist office. Definitely had to wait some time before being seen. I appreciated the directness of the dentist on if I should be getting an onlay. In the end, in getting it or not getting it would lead to the same end result, a crown, so might as well wait. I typically go to a different dentist office in N. Scottsdale and they seemed to always push preventive procedures, like the onlay. The reason that I would return to the dentist in N. Scottsdale and not this one is because I felt the area where patients went looked dingy and dirty and I was very queasy about the dental assistant placing the x-ray bites in my mouth (used mouthwash like crazy when I got home!). Also, they made it seem like they were doing me a favor cleaning my teeth and the teeth cleaning lasted for a short time where it felt like they only cleaned a couple of my teeth. (Maybe I have really clean teeth though, who knows) The office I go to in N. Scottsdale uses a water pick thingy and they spend a decent amount of time going over all of my teeth. I will not re-visit this office again (as like stated above, I've experienced better) but I do appreciate the dentist's second opinion on having an onlay done.
