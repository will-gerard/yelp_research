I would consider myself an icecream/yogurt condiseuer. now.... this place i have been going to since i was a little peewee!  The store actually used to be located on McKellips and Gilbert road and then moved to where it is now. Anyway... this is a local family owned FANTASTIC yogurt shop that has evolved and adapted (to competition) to a yogurt, smoothie, hangout type place. The staff is soo nice and really care for their customers. Always smiling and taking time to ask "how your day was", etc.  Now lets talk about the yogurt.... SOOO PERFECT!!! they offer various flavors every day. they do have a calendar they hand out so you can put on your fridge.  They make great yogurt pies too!!! And the best part of all this is that it is very cheap compared to the chain yogurt/icecream shops!!!! If you live around this area (mesa high school) you definately need to take a yogurt break... makes for a great date or dessert stop after dinner because they have plenty of sitting area in and outside and they have a PACMAN game that you can play while enjoying your delightful treat.  The absolute best place for yogurt!!!!

Good dentist are hard to find, but even harder is to find a good dentist with a good staff! Dr. Dachs is family oriented, kind, and very professional. His staff is soo friendly and their office is not too flashy but really nice. I have been going to this office for the past 5 years and have not been disatisfied once! Scheduling can be very flexible because if you need to come in earlier than your scheduled appointment, they may either squeeze you in or call you when there is an earlier opening! Their goal is for you to have a great smile and happy teeth. I love their little gift they provide after a clean up too! If you're new to the erea and looking for a family dentist... go see Thompson Peak Dental!

Love this place. I stick to the specials on the board... U can't go wrong. Never tried the coffee because I am too much of a coffee snob and rarely do I enjoy a coffee outside of my own kitchen. As for the sandwiches, they do it right. Homemade bread all around. Top picks: patty melt,  ruben, monte cristo, chicken w/ green chilies.

Pizza Mart was my very first favorite spot, besides McDonald's, when i was a teeney lil' hyper brat.  This place has the best pizza dough and great customer service. Not expensive AT ALL!!! and the best part is when your done stuffing your belly with delicious hot oven pizza, you can get a soft serve vanilla  icecream cone for super cheap! makes for a fun first date... they have lots of old video games like king-kong, pac-man, zelda, etc.  atmosphere is very casual... very eighties.

this place is so much fun! small lounge atmosphere, but on fridays DJ Dave Matthias gets it going. Great drinks. Staff very professional and nice.  Do wear nice-casual, no sandles for the men. There are alot of area to mingle, sit, and dance.  Co-ed bathrooms are always very interesting. Fridays are the best!

nice people. gross food.  I got an egg skillet and all I got was cold, rubbery eggs with what looked like left overs tossed on top. I was really disappointed because this place got such great reviews. My dad got an egg combo plate... same low quality food. Bummer!

I went for resturuant week. I got the filet mijon with blue cheese.... although very tasty, I'd rather have my steak with not too much on it. The quality of the food was very good. Their margaritas are soo delicious, not too sweet and with real lime juice. The creme brulee was also very good.  The atmosphere was very fance, prob not a good place for kids. And the staff was over the top... so helpful and friendly.  I was cold and they offered me a soft, cashmere sweater to wear during my dinner. I felt like royalty. great place!

Oh boy!!! If you are in for some scrumptious, finger licking good home-made food this is the place to go. Chris is the chef and a wonderful host. He has an amazing talent with the kitchen. Everything he makes is devine and deliciuos. I had the honor of celebrating my post graduation lunch here with my family. They were all very impressed with presentation, taste, and mood; that they want to return, ASAP! More importantly, my 104yr old grandfather (who is a very picky eater, I might add) ate everything we served him and ZERO complaints. I believe he ate more than me! Thank you Chef Chris for such a memorable dining experience.  You are soo talented. I will definately be returning.

Finally a super cute mommy friendly place for all mommy-baby needs! Took a sleep class that has changed our lives forever. Thank you Cara. Also, had Stephanie help with lactation support for my tongue tied baby. She was amazing! And very understanding and supportive. I truly love this place and what it stands for.
