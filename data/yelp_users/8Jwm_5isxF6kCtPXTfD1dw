I just finished my fantasy football draft in the Colangelo room 8/24/14. We had such a great experience! The two ladies that took care of us (one was in training) were very helpful and didn't fret if we needed anything. We drafted at buffalo wild wings last year in a crowded room with terrible service. I don't remember their names but from the management that helped me set up the draft, to the servers who provided everything promptly, to the cooks who prepared the delicious food on time, thank you and you can mark us down for next year already                             Sincerely,             The Wu-tang Ninjas party

Tried to stop in for a car wash and was in line for a quick express wash on my way home but was stopped and told my car was too dirty for the car wash. The dude who stopped me (manager maybe?)was a real jackass about it too and gave me no other option to get my car cleaned so I left. I will not be back and will let others know not to return as well.

I live in the neighborhood so I thought I'd give this place a shot and it is legit my friends. The restaurant was very clean and the guy up front was very helpful and guided us thru menu questions with ease. I'm not the biggest gyro guy but theirs was the best I've had and my girlfriend really enjoyed her salad. If you itching for Greek give this place a peek lol.

Even though they offer late night eats till 2 am This place sets the standard in the area for their service. As if that wasn't enough they have an awesome 90s hip hop vibe and the food is off the chain.... the beer selection is solid as well with a legit selection of rotating taps. I'll be back and my friends will be sure to hear of this fabulous place.
