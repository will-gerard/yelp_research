WAY OVERPRICED! Don't fall for the Wellness plans, because they don't save you any money. You can get vaccinations way cheaper, and this is the only thing covered in the wellness plans. Surgeries are "discounted" but they are so overpriced to begin with you end up paying more if you were to walk into any vet and get the procedure done. The vets here are very quick with the exams, because all they care about is making a buck. I do admit, the lady vet is nice, I think her name is Leeza. She's the only one who took time with me when I've brought my animals in. They nickel and dime you here for EVERYTHING, because they are on commission. Do your research and take your animals to a well respected vet, not a franchise. Sure, it's convenient since it's inside Pet Smart (the only reason we signed up in the first place) but save your money to spoil you pets :-)

This was a staple during my pregnancy. Ted's is totally worth the wait, although I've never encountered really bad lines. The onion rings are just... omg. I always get the beef hot dogs. Perfect every time! Definitely a must for the weiner-lovers out there ;-)

Im usually here on Tuesdays or Thursdays, and some weeks, both! 1/2 price sushi, appetizers, and drinks on those days. Their sushi is delicious, and they have a wide variety. My fav rolls are the Philly and the Las Vegas, both found on the 1/2 price menu. They also have a lot of no sushi food for you haters :-) The atmosphere is very cool, I love the fishing rod looking chandelier in the middle of the place. The waiters and waitresses are fun and friendly as well.

Took a friend from out of town here. Back home, we have Panera, which is similar to this place. Very delicious. Can get a little pricy, but I'll pay it just to eat better food. The butternut squash soup melted in my mouth. The caesar salad was delicious too. If you feel like soup and salad, or sandwich, this is the place to go!

I really like this place. One of the better Mexican restaurants in the valley. They have great food and their prices weren't outrageous. I sat outside right by a heater... it was heaven. The service was good. Our food was brought out to us right away, but the waiter neglected to notice our empty drink cups. I understand it was busy, and he looked like he was the only one outside at the time, but we were thirsty! All in all, I was satisfied. After we eat there, we usually go and sit up on South Mountain and watch the city lights and walk off the food, lol.

I went here for lunch one day with a co worker, and was not impressed. We sat at the bar, hoping to get faster service, since we were on a time schedule. After about 40 min, and 2 drinks later, our food finally came out. Wasn't impressed. I got a chili dog, and to my surprise, there were 2 of them on my plate. I ate one, and saved the other one for later. Needless to say I was friends with the toilet that evening and threw the other one away. I'll leave the chili dogs to Chicago, they seem to get it there.

Hot dogs are pretty much my favorite food, and Nogales Hot Dogs does not disappoint! There are definitely a few good hot dog places around Phoenix, and this one is up there with the good ones. I had the Sonoran style hot dog, which was absolutely mouth watering. They had a great selection of toppings as well, more than I was expecting. I thought the prices were vary reasonable, about $3-4. If you're looking for a new joint to try a fabulous hot dog, this is the place!

Love Preppy Pet! We've been bringing our dog here for years. He always comes back tired from playing all day, which is exactly what he needs! I'd recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a reasonably priced boarding place. Very homey as well, the staff treats your pets as if they were their own!

My puppy Eli broke his leg, and after taking him to Banfield in Mesa (the vets inside Pet Smart) we were quoted at $2500-$3500 to fix his leg. I was super sick to my stomach. Banfield won't even fix broken legs, so they refered us to the VCA in Mesa. Banfield charged $400 for x-rays and a splint. Anyone who is an animal lover knows there is no price to put on a companion, but then again when you're in this economy, things are very tight. After posting a cry for help on Craigslist, I was referred to Dr. Barbara Capwell about 8 times. I called up, and the receptionist Gretchen was so helpful and compassionate. Dr. Capwell did the surgery for about 1/3 of the cost, and she specializes in orthopedic surgery. She was so helpful and explained EVERYTHING! The clinic is very down to earth, unlike Banfield, which the employees are "cold" and don't really show any compassion. They are paid on commission so all they care about is making a buck. I will be canceling my Banfield plan for all my pets and switch to Gentle Care. I couldn't be more please with a vet.

I actually read the comments below after this company moved all of our stuff, and I couldn't believe it was the same company with all the bad comments below. The guy who moved us said they had some issues with previous workers and that they had let go a lot of bad workers and were properly training the new crew. This was our experience with 1st Integrity...  I bought the Living Social deal, which I thought was a steal (and made me a little weary of the situation) but I went ahead and bought it. I called to schedule and the lady on the phone was very pleasant, told me about the charges outside of the deal ($30 for being on the 2nd floor, and $85/hr after the first 3 hours) which I found to be reasonable. We set up a time frame for 8-9AM. The movers showed up at 8:30am, and  began wrapping up our furniture and more valuable pieces. They moved very quickly and they were very polite. We went over by a few hours and were adequately charged. Then unloaded all of our boxes and furniture unharmed, and I didn't notice any damage. As much as I hate moving and vow to not move again for 20 years, I hope these guys are still around to move us again.
