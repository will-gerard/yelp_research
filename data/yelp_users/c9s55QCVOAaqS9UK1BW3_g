Don't order a salad to go from here. I've had the kale and quinoa salad in the restaurant before and it was delicious. I ordered it to go and was not impressed. There was a very very thin layer of kale and quinoa with massive amounts of feta (which is not on the menu description) and dressing. I ordered it with shrimp so it came to $15 for a disgusting salad that I couldn't even eat. They turned a very healthy option into a fat covered mess.
