I really like this car wash. it is best to go in the morning as the guy that works tends to put a little more effort in but in general it is nice and my car comes out great compared to other auto car washes.

I like this place.  My boyfriend refuses to take our cars anywhere else. my only complaint is when they changed my head light they did something wrong and now it blinks really fast on one side, which is really annoying and kind of takes away from how well kept the car is.

I LOVE this place! Everything is so good and the staff is always friendly.  The prices are reasonable. It reminds me of a smaller version of Maria Maria that was at Tempe Marketplace and has filled that void for me. If it weren't so far from me I would go weekly but am satisfied with going every other month.

We overall enjoyed our visit. I came here for my birthday and my waiter was amazing. The food a delicious. My only real issue is the hostess was the rudest I have ever encountered and I had to take away a full star because of it. No paying customer should be made to feel unwelcomed. She kept glaring at us and rolling her eyes. It was ridiculous.

Only got to have one drink since my reservation next door was ready, but overall it was good. I liked our bartender but the hostess had an attitude and was very short towards us.

I love this place. It gets crowded pretty quick though. I went with a group of friends and we had to sit outside and it was freezing cold which took away from the whole experience.  The food was amazing. We got different appetizers and they were equally good. I got a burger and it was cooked perfectly.

I came back and it was awesome. There was room inside looking towards the outside and it was really nice. My server Andrew was nice and stayed on top on refills. I am glad I came back.

This Dennys is the worst! They are so rude and do not listen at all. I placed an order for pick up and when I called Monica was having side conversations and obviously didn't know how to take phone orders. When we got it home it so completely wrong and inedible.  I seriously wouldn't give it to my dogs. I called them and the girl who answered named Monica was so beyond rude and disrespectful.  She was the person who took my order to begin with and was the one who made the mistake. She gave her phone to her "manager" who was not listening to a thing I was say he kept getting what I was saying completely wrong. I was then passed on to someone else who really could care less about my complaint. I will be just driving the extra 5 minutes to go anywhere else. I will never go here again. Wish I could give them negative stars

Awesome experience. Our waiter, Eric, was very attentive. We had the might meaty, bruschetta, and wings the wings were just okay, but everything else was awesome!

Had the Caesar salad and the outlaw burger. Honestly. Nothing special about the food. They do have a lot of beer but only a basic wine selections, and very cheap wine at that. It is definitely not a date night spot. It is so loud you can't hear and are kind of force to join the loudness because the only way to have a conversation is yelling. To top it off my glass was cracked. That makes me wonder about the judgment of their staff to think it is ok to serve drinks in broken glasses. I left with a headache from the cheap wine and loud crowd.

Currently sitting in drive thru going on 32 mins with only 2 cars in front of me. Saw 7 people walk in and come out within 5 mins of going in. Why have a drive thru if you're going to act like it's not there? Utterly ridiculous for a company whose primary appeal is speed. I could have ordered Barros instead.

I really wanted to like this place. The guy was so nice but it took forever to get our food. When we made it home we realized the extra hot link we ordered and paid for was not there. It wasn't much food for the orice. My boyfriend was very disappointed in it. I will give it one more chance to see if it was an off day.

The ladies are super nice. The bagels are perfectly toasted. I also ordered a Carmel Frap. It is quite good and they use wide straws which is better. Definitely will be my new morning spot.

Went here to grab dinner yesterday for me and a coworker and I thought it was great. The gentleman was very nice and the prices were awesome.  I'll be back again.

By far the worst service I have ever had. They have what seems to be very young girl up front who are more concerned with flirting with the guys in the kitchen instead of taking my order. I have to try to get their attention twice while they stood around talking to each other. I can't even rate the food because the service was incredibly horrible to the point where regardless of the quality of the food, the service just can't be overlooked. plus the soda machine was broken. the owner should really be ashamed. that being said the wings were just decent.

I was sitting there over an hour. The hostess, who has the worse sense of customer service, keeps saying 20mins and then she just didn't seem to know anything. This has been a complete waste of my time. I decided to just go up the street to Olive Garden.
