They have been my credit union for more than 30 years, and they are so far ahead of banks as far as being paperless and having good rates its not even funny. a safety deposit box is a third the price that it is at a bank. so if you are anywhere near them I would recommend them.

Called their Internet sales and got Gregg Adams. He was knowledgeable and although I dread going to dealers, I told them exactly what I wanted and he listened.....  Chester, one of the sales managers looked at my potential trade in car and made a reasonable offer (I am a 'car' guy and my cars are pretty immaculate, so the offer was good, but they have to make money too!). They also gave me a firm price whether I traded the car or not as they did not have the Exact car I wanted.  And to their credit after making a low pressure offer to deal on a color I did not want, went to work to find me what I wanted. They had one coming in 10 days later and committed it to me.  I put my old car on Craig's list knowing I had a reasonable trade in offer, but could still get the new car without the trade. Got MORE than the dealer trade (even when you consider the tax savings) and they did still honor the price on the new one.   All in all a great experience. Ask for Gregg and Chester!!!!!

I moved recently and am not near my favorite Panda Express anymore that was in Ahwatukee. So when I had the opportunity to eat at this one I was glad........     Food was OK, the usual consistent food that you expect.   BUT on the way out I used the restroom and if I had used it before I ordered, I would have just walked out......    They need to check them more often and just don't put a Wet Floor sign up, actually do something to keep it clean. There were two employee's on break when I came in, so they just need to change their priorities and Clean the restroom BEFORE they take their break!

Went for lunch was the worst part of the experience was trying to decide on all the good things on the menu (and a couple of daily specials!)!  Had the veal Parmesan sandwich and left pleasantly full and with a smile on my face!  My lunch companion got a chicken and pasta dish (I can't remember the name, but its the one just above chicken piccata!) and she said it was very good also.   Need to go back and try dinner!!

Was this Broadway?? NO. Was this a 5 Star meal?? No. Went with a group of 20, had a Great time. Service was fine, food was not bad, like you would expect from a Coco's. Salmon was cold (like you would expect serving 100 or so) but actually good! Prime rib was rare but not bad. CAST went out of thier way to make it fun!!! So go with the right attitude and expectation, and just have some fun!!!

We just went to the 4302 E Ray Rd location in Phoenix AZ. Although the food was OK, the restaurant was in terrible condition. It smelled like disinfectant as we walked in, and we discovered why. As you walked further in to the store there was an odor of sewer backup.  After we got our food, we looked at MOST of the tables trying to find a clean one. The best one still needed the chairs to be wiped off, and when running a napkin over the table, it came up black.  The ice machine's grate was broken and laying in the bottom of the drain, and the doors to cabinets below the ice machine were broken and hanging on angles. I should have taken pictures.  We even noticed that the large plastic cup we got for our drink was dirty on the outside like the person unwrapping them had newspaper ink on their hands or something.  Needless to say, we will not be going back to that location and may not do ANY location in the future. Although many have way more STARS!!  The manager mentioned being NEW at that store, so I certainly hope he was there to FIX the issues.

May be Good for Dine in, but don't bother on take out!! 2 entree's with NO extras was $24 and the main dishes were DRY and not spicy (one was supposed to be a SPICY dish). So I will go down the street a bit and get a Better, Cheaper Meal next time for take out!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Don't let the fact that it is a part of a 'chain' put you off. They are as close to a neighbor business as it gets. The manager Todd, seemed to know (many by name) more than half the customers that came in while I was waiting, and you could tell they were happy customers, coming back for regular service.  I have been here in the past for an alignment and was pleased and went back for a few  30,000 mile service items that I do not do myself (I am old school and still do my own oil/rotate tires/wipers, etc). They were among the cheapest of the non dealers I called after you check for coupons on the web. AND, they ended up being slightly less than they quoted me on the phone as the Trans flush required slightly less fluid than standard.   Service was even done slightly ahead of schedule! (PS - Several eating establishments in the same parking lot if you decide to wait)

Terrible customer service and website cost me $100 as their website let me place an order online, while I had an installer working on the project. I got an email saying it was ready for pick up and was 10 miles away from home before they called me to say they did NOT have any of what I needed. I had checked twice in the two days before today to make sure they had stock at other stores as my local store was out.   So since I was driving I asked them to check stock at other stores (as I had already checked the one 3 miles from my house). She told me there is NONE anywhere in the state as it is special order.  So I sent the installer home, and now it is going to cost me another trip charge to come back to finish the job.  So then I call their Corporate 'Customer Care' line who finds stock 25 miles from my house and tells me they can give me 10% off for my trouble. I already had 10% off on line from coupons so this was insulting. Then they promised to call me back, and never did.  Between their website that will tell you one store is out of stock and another has stock even though they have NONE, and a Customer Service person giving out mis information, I will have to spend my time and gas to go get the products, and pay an additional trip charge to my installer. At least if the Customer service person took the time to check, I could have driven and gotten the product and gotten my project done today, with 'just' my time and gas being wasted.

We found our special occasion Chinese food place in our new neighborhood! Friendly and informative staff and GREAT food. The Alcohol drinks were a bit marginal, but we found out it was the waitress that makes them, so next time we will just skip it or stick with something easy!  Will definitely go back!

Great neighborhood place with the same owners and consistent quality for the last 20 years. Anti pasta salad and wings and you can't go wrong!  Pizza is one of the better ones too. Friendly and fast service (we did let them know we were on our way to a concert).....

Not overly impressed.......  It was a large group which I know presents some problems, but the server was not attentive (maybe because he know there would be a Forced 18% tip??). The food was OK, the drinks were OK, although a little on the expensive side. You have to BUY Chips, but thier so-so tortilla's are free.....  Checks showed up severl in a folio, but nothing was said, leading to some confusion. Then the server was indignat about it.  Not sure I would go back, which is a shame as the atmosphere was good..........

Went with another couple on Thursday Scottsdale Art walk. The other couple have been many times over the years, but it was our First time!  I agree with the majority, the food is great!  The Mango Fish was excellent and I did the Pad Tai with a 2.5 on a scale of 1-5 (5 being the hottest) and it was really a 2.5!! Next time I will crank it up to 3 as there was still plenty of flavor and it was not overpowered by the heat.   AND the seasonal drink was a Pumpkin Martini which I would of had a few more of if I was not driving!

We have been to Elements twice in the last 3 months. BOTH times it was Excellent!  Great Views and great for Special occasions.   Try the Swordfish or the Scallops, but the Filet Mignon for the meat eaters.  Specialty are not only tasty, but they are not stingy on the alcohol.   Lastly the deserts are a special Treat. Their 'signature' desert is the Chocolate Peanut Butter Bomb, but last time we also had a Salted Caramel Cheesecake, with a Sesame Seed wafer, topped with Bacon Gelato!

Just like the other reviews, J.J. was my technician and was Great!!  He could not have been more professional, knowledgeable or personable!!   They were on time, explained what he was doing and gave me a mini lesson on windshield replacement while he worked, even though he was just filling a chip! Thanks again!!

Have been for Lunch and Happy Hour and have not been dis appointed! Great lunch food and enough variation to make most people happy. And a great place to take out of town guests. You can sit right next to one of the golf course greens and watch some golfing. Happy hour food is not huge portions, but tasty too!!!

If your looking for an Old Country type bar, look no further.......   Packed on a Friday night, 8 of us went and had their All You Can Eat Fish Special....... Nicely done without a LOT of breading, and seconds and thirds came out quickly!!!  Then top it off with Smores you make yourself at your table.....   All the fixings with a can of flaming sterno delivered to you table!!   Then you can go dance, always a live C&W band, or go watch  Just be prepared to get a bit dusty.

Moved to a new area and were having some things done to the house and we need to kill an hour or two for lunch. Needless to say we found this by accident(because it was close) and figured it must be good as it was not easily visible from any main streets.  We were not dis appointed!! The staff was friendly, gave us the history of the place as they had been there for like 8 years! If you looking for a Great casual restaurant with a good variety on the menu, this is it!   PS - we YELP'ed it before we walked in and the good reviews were accurate!!

After reading the reviews I was a little concerned about what to expect.... But was going with a large group (20) for someone's going away party. Service was exceptional, food was Great!!! Many of us did the 4 course for $32 and I did not hear a complaint from anyone!!!  Just before the entree's came, my better half left the table to head to the restroom. When the waiter noticed she was not there, he grabbed a cover for her food and when he saw her heading to the table, he ran back and took the cover off BEFORE she got to the table!!!  Does not get better than that!!  I had the shrimp scampi on the four course deal, and was Pleasantly surprised!!  Friday evening.

The IN Place to go. Very Southwest Fusion.........   We sat on the Patio which is great at this time of year in Phoenix......  Try the Ribs or Deconstructed Tacos.  Specialty Drinks were VERY good too. Had a take of on an Old Fashion with some kind of orange liquor that I never heard of in it and it made it a Unique, in a good way, Cocktail.

Great 'family' atmosphere and the FOOD is REALLY Great!!   If you are taking someone there to impress them, the restaurant itself is nothing special, a little on the small side and plain seating.   But when the food comes, you will be rewarded with an unbelievable meal.  Although I am partial to the Gyros, the Kafta and rice (with golden raisins) are to die for!    So go with an expectation of casual dining, with great food, and you will not be disappointed.

If you were not Looking for this Place, you would NEVER see it...It is NOT on a main roadway. Although there is a grand piano being played there, you may be seated at an iron outdoor table.  BUT,  It has been there for 8 years.  So what does that tell you??  The Food is REALLY quite good!!!!  I had the Fuego Seafood Chile Relleno and my wife had the Signature Pernil Asado. BOTH were excellent.  It is not cheap, but with the limited amount of seating, they have to make it work.....  Next time we will plan on NOT finishing our meals (I actually finished mine and my wife happily has lunch today from hers!) and get to try the deserts!!

Lots of well marked and maintained trails for different levels of hikers. The staff at the office is great and Ranger Mark will happily answer questions. Looking forward to doing a guided tour of an old mining shaft. Ranger Mark said last time there were rattlesnakes and a bat to see!! He gave hikers the choice and they wanted to leave the rattlesnakes (they were in the cold cave and VERY inactive=safe) to see rather than clear them out! After all, they were there first and it is there to preserve nature!!!

Appetizers were great and at Happy Hour prices, hard to beat! Drinks are cheap too! Josh was good at getting our group of 15 seated together! The only reason they did not get 5 stars as the waitress seemed a little scattered.... Asking for napkins or extra lemons for the water seemed a stress to her......    I always wonder if the gratituity being included on lard

Went for dinner on a Saturday evening and it was an EVENT. 5 of us were there and it was a 4 hour extravaganza of unique combinations of ingredients. Part of the experience is waiting to see what shows up next.  Try the sampler (you have 4-5 levels to choose from).   And the Wine selection was well done.   Just do not expect a decadent ambiance and you will not be disappointed.......

New owners and staff....... too bad......  The food is close, but not as good as with the previous staff.  The egg rolls are mediocre and when you ask to substitute a crab puff, they tell you only at dinner not at lunch...... Which does not make sense as they charge 99 cents for an egg roll, but crab puffs are 6 for $3.75 or about 65 cents each. I hate wasting food and since the main course is just OK, this makes it tough not to drive down the road to Fast Food Chinese!!!!

Moved from one side of town to the other and was looking for a good Mexican food place to replace our old one.........  Stopped for lunch one day and are hooked. Have been back many times and taken several groups there for lunch and dinner. Inside and outside seating. Great Summer weekend and seasonal specials too.  Try one of their skillets and great for seafood.

Finally made it in time for Happy Hour! Got 3 'appetizers' for the 2 of us and could NOT finish!! A lot of really good food at very reasonable prices. Good variety on Happy Hour too. Drinks were good pours and could get house or premium.  ALSO, it was mentioned to us by Vinnie that they now do reverse Happy Hour 8-10 PM 7 nights a week!

So I have lived in Phoenix for 35 years now and driven all over the place to hike.....  Now I live in Cave Creek, so I decided to check out Spur Cross that you can access just before you get to downtown Cave Creek...... So how good can it be so close to town???   We went this past Sunday and started off on an intermediate trail, which was just was it said, but then we were pleasantly surprised that the Creek was actually running!! They had boards over the first few crossings and then we had to do a little bit of boulder hoping on the later crossings. We went in about two miles until we got to the horse back riding stable (I think it is just a stop for their tours). Great scenery even if the creek was not running and even better that it was.......    So on the way back we decided to do the 'Easy' leg to the parking lot and WOW!!  There was some of the LARGEST Saguaro's I have ever seen in AZ!  If you have out of town guests, and want to impress them, take them here! Its only 1.5 miles on dirt roads and the easy trail where the impressive cactus are is only about  mile so even 'out of shape' guests can do it.   Then head into Cave Creek for some food. You won't be sorry you took the time to drive up there!!

I am trying my best to support the Post office, but they make it difficult. I took the day off as I had several deliveries today requiring signatures. The FE delivery showed up as expected. I checked my mailbox at 1 PM and again at 3 PM.  Sure enough the Postman leaves a 'Sorry We Missed You' card in my box. My doorbell worked for FE, I checked it again and I did NOT leave the house.   I know they are buried, but this kind of service only gives them a worse reputation. I will choose other carriers if I can.  ADD: To his credit, a manager did find my package at the branch the same day and called me so I was able to pick it up that day and not wait until the next day. I still had to drive there, but at least I got it.

Well we are new to the area and had always enjoyed the Happy Hour at the Chandler Mall location, so we thought we would give this one a try with some friends.....     It was crowded as it was a beautiful night and we sat on the patio. Our waiter could be a double for Orlando Bloom as Will Turner in Pirates of the Caribbean.  In any case, the four of us ordered some drinks which came out quickly and then some HH appetizers. Well, someone dropped the ball and there was NO Food for about an hour (we were not impatient as we were catching up with some friends). But to our waiters credit, when he realized the time delay, he spoke to his manager who comped the food (which the waiters recommendations were great!!)   SO bottom line, their actions to remedy a bad situation will make us stop by again to see if it was a fluke (as we suspect as our friends had been to this location with no issues).    We are rooting for them to be good!!

So we moved to Cave Creek and heard about this place.... It lives up to it's reputation as is really good!!  Decent portions... Little touches like cole slaw made with olive oil DO make a difference. We will be stopping for lunch or dinner in the near future. Spicy BBQ was hot, but not crazy. Also not sure what's in the cowboy beans but it was really good to. Oh ya, but like most places in downtown Cave Creek no need to get dressed up!!

For a Specialty Martini and a light meal (menu is really heavy appetizers, not meals) this is a good place to go. Happy hour runs later than most places (7- or 7:30PM) and if you are Female, you join their 'club' and your first drink is FREE!! They usually have a decent dance band on weekends, but it does get crowded and the dance floor is small. And it is a pretty young crowd, but we usually make it through the first set of the band!!  All in all, a good asset for that area that is coming back to like recently with a comedy club opening and soon a country bar!!

So most of us do not like dealing with Car dealerships, and I normally always call the internet department as you seem to get better service and are not subjected to the salesperson who swoops in as you walk from parking your car!!  We were in the final stage of deciding WHICH car my wife wanted and wanted to test drive one last model as she had a day off and we were running Errands.  We stopped to test drive one more model and decided that was the one......   We were working with another dealership, but they had very little stock.   So before we walked out the door, they asked what they could do, with very low pressure. We told them and they surprised us by responding positively.  After some back and forth, we ended up getting that car that day (they had one in the color we wanted with just 4 miles on it).   So not a bad experience!!! Ask for Daisha Doolittle. Not only is she a salesperson, she actually is a Mazda zealot!! LOL!!!!

The antipasta was good, the Buffalo chicken sandwhich was OK, the Pizza was OK,  Too bad those who had pizza were almost done by the time I got my sandwhich. Although I realize it is not a full service place, after you order they do not make you feel like you are important to them, just more of a distraction from other things they are doing.... Might stop before or after a movie, but would not go otherwise.

Great product and great Customer service!!  I have called them with questions as I never owned a spa before (had a pool for 28 years) and they were patient and very helpful. Everyone who has seen it is impressed with the design and how 'sturdy' everything is. The upgraded version (more HP and Jets) was not that much more and still WAY less than many spa's and I think this one is MORE efficient and will give more years of service!!  Thanks Tuff Spa's and Ian (who answers the phone and has been so helpful!!)

So fast forward some months..... They say they have a lifetime warranty on the shell and cover.....     One side of my cover, which they have redesigned by the way, 'drops' about 1" when I open it. They told me to check the cover's shaft, which entails taking it apart. I did what they asked and found that it was NOT the problem they suspected. I did notice that when the cover is open, the sides rest in different places. So I think I Determined (not them) what the problem was. The hole to attach the lid, or the hole in the lid itself was drilled in the wrong place. I sent pictures as asked. MULTIPLE Calls later, still no answer of solution. They 'call' the production manager. They 'ask' the local manager. BUT NO RESOLUTION!  TERRIBLE Customer service!!!!

OK, Fast forward to almost the 2 year mark. Tuff Spa's did eventually get their manufacturing in CA to come up with a solution to the lid issue and sent me some replacement parts. I do have to install them myself, but my spa 'dealer' is gone (out of business), so that is not their fault.  Then out of the clear blue I get a note from them. They noticed my negative Update and wanted to know if everything was resolved. I told them reasonably so, but now I have another issue. I was an early adopter of their 'Painted' (to look more like stone) panels. Less than 2 years in the west and south panels were faded and peeling. So I sent some pictures.....  Even though their spa's have been redesigned and manufacturing moved from California to Prescott AZ, they said they would repaint the panels. Luckily I live in the same area (35 miles away) and was able to bring them the panels and pick them up.   So the spa looks great again, and hopefully now they have the process perfected and they should not fade as much or as quickly. In Phoenix AZ, the sun fades EVERYTHING, but I hope we get at least 5 years this time!!

Moved to a new area and am in search of good everyday (pick up on the way home from work), and special occasion Chinese food. Our first stop here was in eat and nothing to write home about. But we gave it another chance and did take out and were more impressed. We have done pick up several times now and one more dine in and have only been slightly disappointed once! I think like any other place, you will love some dishes and other only so-so. So once you find what you like there, stay with it!

For the "fast food" of hair saloons, if you pick a stylist and stick with them, it's OK. This location seems to be better run than others in the area. Can not breat the price and you get coupons in the mail to make it even cheaper! Don't forget to check in on line or through the phone app and your wait is minimal.

First, the food was 'homemade' good................  The service, not so much.  Wednesday night, 7PM. Several parties in the waiting area. Bartender and another person saw us and Ignored us. I finally went and asked, and they said a server would be right there. Server comes and tells all of us, seat yourself where ever you want.   Ordered margarita's and took the waitresses advice. We took our time with the menu as there a lot of choices, and not the normal fare.   Finally ordered, still no drinks, and then waitress suggests an appetizer to try next time we are there as I told her it was our first time. So we ordered the appetizer, yellow peppers, wrapped in bacon and stuffed with Shrimp!! GOOD!!!!  Margarita's finally came as the bartender had to deliver (apologized for the delay), as the waitress was under age.   The apps come, no silverware. We had  stopped a bus boy to get water and napkins. Of course we had JUST gotten our drinks.  Then 20-25 minutes later the main course. Again good, but I ordered a burro and got a chimi version which I did not want, but did not want to wait anymore and did not take them up on the offer to redo it..  Again, food was great!!   Bill comes and not only did they STILL charge for the Chimi instead of the burro I ordered, but we realize they brought us one LARGE Marg, which we did not ask for. So apparently you HAVE to specific to get a normal size.  SO although we enjoyed the unusual and tasty fare (We saw Guacamole made table side and their Chipolte sauce is made there too.) 90 minutes and two mistakes later it just was NOT worth it. At the VERY least she should have NOT charged for the Chimi that was more expensive than what I ordered.

We found this place using a Groupon as we saw it was close in our new neighborhood.  We were pleasantly surprised with great service, good house wine and a good pizza. The calamari appetizer was great and the lemon sauce to die for.  The vanilla Nutella cheesecake with raspberry strawberry jam was Really good.  The menu had some attractive entrees so we will have to go back without a Groupon and try their fare....  Oh and did I mention they have live music Wednesday through Saturday with happy hour all day on Sunday and Monday....  :)

We are Cave Creek Residents and think this is a bit of a tourist trap......   We got the dinner Sampler Platter. Beef Ribs (meh), Pork Ribs (OK), Beef Brisket (Meh) and Pulled Pork (pretty good!). The corn bread muffins were OK, but the Cole slaw was terrible and the beans were about as bland as could be.   The beers are inexpensive, but the food is just OK, except for the pulled pork and BBQ sauce.   So if you stick with a beer and pulled pork you'll be OK, otherwise I would skip it!

Not sure about some of the reveiws that talk about bad service or mediocre pizza...... We were seated after a short wait on a Saturday evening and our waiter checked on us every few minutes without being intrusive...... We ordered two different kinds of Pizza and one Calzone and all three were excellent........  The biggest negative was that I ate WAY more than I should have!!!!

After seeing some of the reviews about the service, I was a bit concerned that some friends were meeting there...... But I figured we were all off that day, so what's the difference.  SO, we had unbelievably good service!! Our drinks were checked on often, without being obtrusive.  As for the burgers, not only was it $11 Wednesday for building your own burger, but they were REALLY good..........   Beer looked cold, but 3 of 4 of us were not drinking at lunch!! LOL!!

For a CASUAL Sushi meal, Can't be beat!! Other than waiting for something you saw to come back, the convertor belt concept is great! And you can't beat the price anywhere!!!!  I will stop by again.

Will agree with most everyone else, Food was exceptional! Had some interesting combinations and it was hard to choose.  Service was impeccable and a great balance from being attentive and being TOO attentive.   To be fair, we (a group of 6) got there at 8:30 on a Saturday night, so the dinner rush was passed. But I cannot imagine it making much of a difference if it was crowded!!

A group of 8 of us decided to meet for Happy Hour. They were able to accommodate us at the 'Chefs' table next to the kitchen (which was great). T he Bartender Gary was our server and was quite personable and help make the evening even more enjoyable.   Gary suggested and mixed some great drinks and the food, both from the Happy Hour menu and from the regular menu was very good..........   The only downside was we were sitting under a couple of vents that I think were opened all the way due to being next to the kitchen. So even though it is still HOT outside, several of us were Freezing....  Found the place as it smelled SO GOOD outside as we walked past. They have a huge rotisserie that they do chicken and other dishes. Hard to pass up and we will be back to try the rotisserie dishes too!

If your picky and looking for a great job on tint, I would definitely recommend Dan.  20 years experience and knows his stuff.  He uses quality tint (I investigate brands as I have done Clear bra myself and had Ceramic tint in the past!) He does the work himself, not some part timer out in a parking lot!  Glad I was able to get a car where the dealer had not already put on tint so I can get what I wanted and glad I discovered Dan's.

I recently moved from Ahwatukee to Cave Creek. I have used Discount Tire exclusively for about 20 years now. I used to use Costco, but had some less than satisfactory experiences and now use Discount Tire ONLY.   This Store seems to be lower volume and more relaxed than any other Discount Tire I have been to. They were polite and efficient. Its funny that sometimes I felt like they were 'rushing' at other stores, while here they seemed almost too relaxed. But they did get the job done and they were the first store to go check my spare tires air pressure when doing a rotation and balance.    So I will go back, not only because its the closest store, but because they did a good job.   PS - another reason I use Discount Tire is that it is nice to know they have a LOT of locations, not only in AZ but in other states. While my wife was on a business trip in Flagstaff, I went with to do some hiking and photography and was able to get her tires rotated and balanced while there!!

So NO one likes the inconvenience of a flat tire....  But it is nice when you get taken care of....     I spotted a nail in my tire that only has 8,000 miles on it, got out my spray bottle with soapy water and it was leaking....   SO I drove to the DIscount tire store, and got it fixed........    BUT a week later I decided to check the repaired tire and to my surprise it is 10 lbs low again. I get out my spray bottle and sure enough, the REPAIR is leaking.  Back to the store where they tell my that is a problem and can't be fixed, BUT they will get a new tire and replace it no charge as the repair did not hold....... COOL!!  BUT  of course NONE of the 900 stores in the US have that tire!! It is only 10 months old, but Michelin decides to redesign it and the replacement is not in stock locally either!!!! So not only do I have to wait until the end of the week,  I face having 3 tires and one different on my 2011 Infiniti. I Said no way, order me 2 so I at least have matching tires on the same axle, which is what you are supposed to do.    End of story is that after talking to the management they 'helped' me a little with the price of the extra tire (NOT their fault), so although I hate the idea of buying one, at least I did not pay full price, which was $26 more than the ones it is replacing.   Thanks for keeping me a happy, 25 year customer!

Although the Burger was Good and the Shake Very Good, while waiting for my burger, I made the mistake of watching the staff. OK, I realize its tough working 8:30PM on a Saturday night and I do not expect them to be serious, but throwing food around and landing on the grill, dropping a glove on a burger being made as a joke, and FINALLY putting FOOD on the brim of a CO-Workers hat which then falls on the burgers being prepared, is not SANITARY!!!  I spoke to Ashley, the 'Manager' who apologized and said she would have a word with the employee in question. They went in the back for about 90 seconds and came out like nothing happened.   They do not need to be totally serious, but it is not funny or acceptable to 'play' with the food they are preparing for CUSTOMERS!

To their credit, even though I checked the box that said NO NEED to be contacted, their regional manager contacted me to let me know that they used my feedback as a 'training moment' and offered me a return visit on them.   Its good to see a company take constructive criticism to heart and address it.

Tasty food with a nice atmosphere. Was there for the relatively new 'brunch'. Was good enough that I would go back to check out dinner!

I am not sure what some expect from an OUTDOOR food event. Although restaurants should try to show off their signature dishes, the logistics and circumstances are not ideal.    So maybe I am 'easier' to please than some, but I have been to quite a few of these events and this was FAR from being a bad one......   Most did not run out of food, at least at 1:00 when I left and for the most part did a good job. A few, I was surprised by the lack of quality and if I was going to do one of these I would make sure it was not a NEGATIVE experience.   Two that I thought were not very good are long time fixtures in Phoenix and I could not help but wonder what were they thinking!! I know the next time someone suggests we go to one of those two, I will probably pass!   All in all, I would go back.

This is the place to explore IF you have a creative side, and have some fun social time!  They provide the supplies and 'help' you paint a picture. Great for groups and you get to BYOB for food and drinks, including booze!!   And SURPRISINGLY some of the pictures are pretty good. Even mine is NOT embarrassing! HAHA!!

OK, they recently took away my biggest complaint, they added sun sades to block out the blinding late afternoon sun. So now it should be way more comfortable for those facing the windows and even if you are not, you don't have to contend with the over brightness!!  Now if I just had some painting talent!!

I concur with most of these reviews! Great food and service.  Shakes are unbelievably GREAT!!!! Get the one with pretzels in it, the classic sweet and salty in a milkshake.  They have turkey, chicken and veggie selections that are actually GOOD!! LOL!!  Got to talking to the server, they had 1,000 applications, hired 100 and trained them 9 days before they opened. So they know about the food and how it is prepared.  Will make it a point to stop by again in the near future!!

OK, so its hard to screw up Breakfast, but it is also hard to make it stand out........  Both times we have been here, we have been pleasantly surprised!!   I had the Lump Crab meat Benedict and it was more than ordinary, and I got the Sweet Potato Fries instead of Hash Browns.  My father in law had the Swedish pancakes because he has been to Sweden multiple times and said they were just as good as being there!! LOL!!  Next time we are looking forward to going for lunch (they are open until 2)......

+If your new to food 'smoking' or want to know about it to decide if its for you, this is the place to go!  Lots of INFO!!!!    +I am more of a Grill guy, but learned some tips that apply.  +Do make sure you bring drinks as they do not provide or have any available for purchase.   +Also, make SURE to eat a little something before you go as the first food you get is 4 hours into the class (which makes sense since YOU do the cooking).  +The products and prices on what they sell in the store are good (and they make sure you know it at the beginning of the class!)  -You do spend time cleaning up a lot, and like any group, some do not do their share! Might be a good idea to 'assign' each table a cleaning task, just like they assign each table cooking tasks!! -Don't expect a fancy place, just a space in an industrial plaza and I guess that works as they do create a lot of smoke outside!!!

Food was good, Jamie the waitress was great ask for her. Prickly pear margarita was really good, and ask to have hatch sauce added to your burro if you like it hot. This location is different than the other ones so try both, but this location is a little bit healthier in a little bit lighter.

A group (about 20) of us called ahead for happy hour. They accommodated us and even made sure that we could bring our 'dogs' (we were coming from an outdoor Art Fest and a few had theirs with) by seating us on the patio.   HH Food was Very good and there was enough variety for everyone. From sea food to Chorizo!  They also had several drink specials that were tasty and unusual.  Will need to stop by for dinner!!

Good time with good Friends!  They had some very clever puzzles (figuratively and literally)! With a group of 8 we could not finish in the hour! Without giving out any important info, you HAVE to think out of the box to figure many of them out.  We had a great mix of friends with different strengths and everyone contributed, but we still did not finish in the hour, but had a great time trying!!  AND we did the easier of the two rooms!!
