Great place! Looks a little scary from the outside, but the food is excellent,.....not $100 per person formal steak house excellent,...more like local, homey feeling, neighborhood-y excellent.  The owner, Sarge, is a great guy. Food portions are plentiful, quality is excellent and prices are good.  Gyros are giant!!

I have to agree with the people who gave this shop POOR reviews.  I too have lived in Ahwatukee for 15+ years and have gone to this shop many times in the past.  It seems they are getting worse and worse.  I will never go back and I would encourage you to do the same.  Although I have spent thousands of dollars at this shop on bikes and service, my recent experiences were TERRIBLE; both with the hip-hop, gangster looking "kid" up front "Dennis" and the owner who didn't want to "undermine" the incorrect information, bad attitude and poor customer service his novice front-man had been providing.  I purchased a Specialized FSR from this shop over the years along with many other parts, accessories and services for all of my family's bikes (all Specialized). I had not gone back in a while because the service had been getting worse.  But I figured it's 2013 and I'd give them another shot and try to support them.  Yesterday I called to get prices on some basic work - replace a wheel, replace a couple tubes, etc.  Dennis asked me some questions and quoted me prices - very straight forward.  I loaded up my gear, my kids and headed to the shop.  Dennis (wearing his gangster hat, earrings and a bad attitude) looked and said "I quoted you the wrong parts",....he said it's going to be about $70 additional on top of what was only going to be about $70 anyway.  I proposed that since they quoted me the wrong prices over the phone and I just hauled all my gear and my kids over there, that we split the difference or make some kind of proposal to make it right.  I said I understand sometimes things get quoted wrong, but let's do the right thing, come to an arrangement we are both happy with and everything will be good.  I made a couple proposals and to each he said no, he will only charge me full price of all the misquoted items.  Some guy, apparently the owner, who never introduced himself to me or said he'd like to help, rather, he said he didn't want to undermine Dennis, started barking at me, saying "what, you never make a mistake? - you want me to do the work for free? - are we not allowed to make a mistake?  you can take your business elsewhere".  I said, really, you want to lose a long-term, loyal customer who has spent thousands of dollars in your shop because you quoted the wrong price and now you don't even want to try to come to an arrangement that will work for both of us?  I realize you don't want to lose money, who would,...but I'm sure we can come to some arrangement since you quoted me the wrong prices after I gave you all the information you asked for. He was not interested, kept his negative, poor service attitude and went back into the shop to work on a bike part.  I was shocked.  My little boys were shocked!  As we drove toward Curbside Cyclery and Javelina Cycles (trustworthy shops) to get the work done, my boys both said they could not believe how unreasonable they were at South Mountain Cycles and how impressed they were with me for talking nicely and trying to get it worked out into a win/win solution when the guys at SMC were such "jerks".  Pretty insightful for 13 and 11 year old boys (who also will never take their business to SMC as they grow up).  ***** I would recommend you AVOID SMC BIKE SHOP *****  The owner and his staff CLEARLY don't care about customer service, quality workmanship or doing the right thing (and reading the other reviews, I'm not the only one who has had the same experience - sure, you can buy a bike from them, they'll be happy to take your money for a sale,....but don't expect to be treated well regarding service or parts from there after).  I'd guess the positive reviews are written by their friends or employees.  There are several other shops here in Ahwatukee that are honest and quality.  Let's show SMC that we won't accept being treated poorly.  Let's take our business elsewhere and support shops that support our community and treat us with the respect we have shown them all these years that is obviously not reciprocated.  Check out all the negative Google reviews on this place.

I love this place. Very nice, upscale but casual atmosphere, friendly staff, quality food, reasonable prices. Been to several locations, always good. You could come on a date, to grab takeout, with the family, whatever.  I've had other Thai here in the valley and this place is an 8.5 in my opinion for strictly the food, the other attributes push it up a bit.  Hard to go wrong here.  Why 4 stars instead of 5, feeling like I need to reserve those for absolutely knock your socks off, out of this world places,...sometimes I can be too generous, but this place is really good, give it a shot.

Love this place!!  The food is fantastic, service is always friendly and feels very local - but high-end at the same time.  Excellent live music in the bar and outstanding happy hour with great prices, great selection and high quality.  Martinis here are incredible!  Pizzas are made in a real wood fired oven on site from scratch and are amazing!  Dinners are clearly made from scratch from old world recipes and are fantastic.  I would highly recommend this place on all fronts - it's one of my all time Ahwatukee favorites!

This is one of our all time favorite family restaurants.  The selection is fantastic and all the food is high quality.  All you can eat Asian food, sushi and Mongolian BBQ, plus desert,....how can you beat that?  Staff is friendly and attentive.

This is a 7 STAR REVIEW. Here is the real, honest to goodness truth. I've done tons of reviews. I've given some 5 stars before. Now that I've been to Kai, I literally feel that I need to go back and move all others down a full star. Kai is by far, that good and the absolute best food and experience I've ever had. It's simply not fair to put other 5 star Yelp reviews on par with this restaurant. I'm a food lover, a dining experience lover. Honestly, I kind of prefer the hole-in-the-wall places, mom and pop, casual. Kai may have changed me,...no, it did change me. I have a new appreciation for restaurants like this. It was beyond tremendous. I truly believe it may have ruined me on other "really nice" restaurants. I would hate to be the next "really nice" restaurant I go to because there is absolutely no-way it will measure up to Kai.  Bottom line, this was the best "dining experience" of my life. And I've been to some nice places in some pretty cool countries. Why?  Service: absolutely impeccable. All plates served and cleared at the same time. Silverware heated/chilled to appropriate temperature for your next dish. Sommelier was spot on, picked the exact wine I described we'd like that night, absolutely perfect.  Wait staff: friendly, incredibly knowledgeable, polite, timely, genuine. Best I've ever had, ever, anywhere, hands down.   Food: Carefully, lovingly prepared by what are clearly experts, with the absolute best, freshest, highest quality ingredients in the perfect amounts. Best tasting, robust, full, absolutely incredible. We were worried portion sizes would be small. Worried for nothing, we were stuffed, perfect!  Atmosphere: peaceful, comfortable, soft, warm, comforting, soft music, lots of space, clean. Simply unreal  Value: honestly, for the service, quality, quantity and the entire experience, this is the best value there is, worth every penny and not excessively priced. I've had much less for much more money.  No kidding, if I could afford to eat here EVERY NIGHT, hands down, I would do it.  I honestly wish there was a 6 star option,...or 7. This is just like the Tesla Model S P85D breaking the Consumer Reports Rating Scale. It only goes to 100 and the car scored 103. That is Kai, better than the best.  If you have to forego 5 restaurants to save to go to Kai, do it! Don't miss this restaurant, whatever you do.

Unfortunately, there was no response from the owners. Would be nice to know they read their customer's feedback and respond to issues. However, I did give them a fair shot and tried it again in hopes the discrimination (or reverse-discrimination) I experienced was a fluke.  About 7 months later, on October 3rd, I returned to try it again. There was no discrimination and we were treated extremely well by the staff. The food was just as good as the last time. It was fantastic. I found myself humming and moaning and licking my fingers and sucking every drop of flavor from all the food, my sweetie's leftovers, our delicious alcohol drinks and our appetizer. Seriously, it is like food from heaven. I do love the atmosphere, it's casual, but fun, loud, but not really loud, hard to explain,....upbeat, fun, relaxed, vibrant,....the building is really cool for such a sketchy part of town.  So, in all fairness, if last time was just a fluke, and this time is the norm. I'd say, don't miss it, it's delicious!!

This may seem like a strange review because I am not posting because I bought something from Kartunes.  I'm posting because I didn't.  Huh?  Read on,...you'll be glad you did.  I received a LockPick as a birthday gift.  It was purchased online.  My understanding of the product was that it allowed me to add cameras, a Bluetooth module, play DVD's on my built-in navigation screen, plug in any Apple device to play on my nav monitor, unlock items locked from the factory, etc.  Lots of stuff!!  I was very excited!!  We researched installation places here on Yelp to find the best.  I was surprised to find Kartunes.  Why?  I used when I moved to Phoenix in 1987 that had the same name.  Couldn't be the same place.  Nevertheless, the reviews are fantastic and the reviewers seem genuine and reliable, so I called.  The guy who answered the phone, Josh, seemed really knowledgeable, friendly, honest, communicative,....all the things you want when you deal with a professional company who will have control of your vehicle.  I showed up for the appointment and met with Jeff, the owner.  Great guy!  Super easy to talk with, extremely knowledgeable, trustworthy, honest and willing to take as much time as I needed.  I told him I used a company  with the same name back in 1987 and a couple times since then (way before Yelp) and he seemed familiar.  Turns out, same guy, same owner, same company,....even has employees that have been with him for 17 years,....wow!!!  What does this tell you??  He is doing something (everything) right!  Treat your employees right, treat your customers right and you will stay in business and flourish for almost 30 years,...amazing and impressive!!  We started talking about the LockPick device I brought to have installed.  I shared what I was most excited about, which was all of it,.....he told me that what I wanted it to do and my understanding of what it will do, are not exactly what it will do.  It will play movies and such from Apple devices, but not the newer ones with the lightning connections, only the older ones. It also won't do some of the other things I had understood.  He was right about all of it.  It was very clear Jeff was not putting down the device or trying to up-sell me on something else,.....he was actually just being incredibly honest and even talking me out of the installation I had come for that day.  Is this a bad thing?  No way!!  His honesty earned me as a customer for life.  While I didn't buy anything to have installed that day, I absolutely guarantee I will go to Jeff at Kartunes for anything and everything mobile audio and video I ever need,....ever!!  I will have more cars, boats, planes, etc, etc, etc and he has my future business.  Why?  Because now I trust him.  This is hard to get in a service industry, especially from me.  His shop is clean and professional, he is communicative and honest and genuinely cares about his customers experience and satisfaction; not just making a buck on installation.  I'm picky and not easily impressed.  There's a reason Jeff has been in business so long, has dedicated, long term employees and has outstanding reviews here.  Before you decide on any other place, talk with him.  You won't be sorry.

Have eaten lots of middle eastern food, even at really good places, and seriously, EVERYTHING at this place is better than the others,....and some others are really good! There is something about the quality and tastes here that simply surpass the others. Is it fancy and well decorated? No. It's in a corner type market. But, amazing food! And the service is always friendly and you feel like part of the family.  Prices? Ridiculously moderate/mainstream for what you get.  Worst thing about this place is I don't get to eat here enough,.....oh, and that I can't get this exact food everywhere at any moment - they've ruined me on middle eastern food anywhere else.

Tasty food, authentic, wood fired, fresh. Bread is fresh baked and crusty, delicious with fresh olive oil. If you like thin, crispy, crusty pizza, this is for you.  Service was exceptionally friendly and attentive.  Really cool building with exposed brick walls, open metal roof, wood tables. Fun, cozy, small, homey-feeling.  Fair value: $18 for what equates to a medium sized pizza. Basic salad was $6. About $26 total with tax. $5 tip.  Would I go again, ya probably, would try a different pizza, something new and a beer or glass of wine. I'd recommend it for the entire experience.

Have I seriously not reviewed Chinos?????  How can that be???? I've been coming to Chino's for about 20 years. I started at the only location, up on Bell and 19th Ave (I think that's where it is) even though I live in Ahwatukee. Then, after 4 years of them having a sign saying "Chandler location coming soon!", it finally opened. I was in heaven!!  Went there often until it unfortunately closed and now it's back occasionally to the one on the west side.  Why do I love it? The food. Simply awesome! Comfort food, filling, tastes delicious, and tons of it! How do you mix Mexican, Caribbean and Chinese? Never thought of it, but Chino's does it and my family and I LOVE it! Love that you can get whatever you want as an entree, in a burrito or in a quesadilla. Love that it's served in a metal to-go container, sitting at plastic tables and chairs. It's the ultimate dive, hole in the wall, established forever, for good reason, place. The service is typically friendly and the cookies that come with your dish, especially when they're the chocolate volcano cookies, are awesome! Black Caribbean beans, jerk fried rice, jade red chicken and emerald chicken, yummmmm! I absolutely love this place.  Seriously, if you've never tried this place, it is an absolute must try!!! Once you do, if you're like me, a week or so later you'll start to crave it,...so good.

Very friendly staff. Good selection of food, not quite as much as the world buffet at the Rio, but good selection. The Mediterranean was high-quality and tasted great. Nice choice of desserts. Love the all-you-can-drink alcohol including premium beers!

This is one of my all time favorite "hole in the wall" restaurants.  Been going to Chino's since the only one was way up on the west side - and I was coming from Ahwatukee.  I have turned many people on to Chino's and all have become lifetime fans (except one person who is a bit "picky").  The food is like nothing you can find anywhere else.  It is fantastic.  All served in aluminum to-go containers.  You sit at folding tables on conference chairs, floor is stained concrete, drinks are from styrofoam cups.  This is not 5 star dining, but is AMAZING feel good, happy food.  I have tried everything over the years and my favorites are Jade Red Chicken either plain, in a burrito or in a quesadilla, Emerald Chicken, Chilli Rellano (this is like none you have ever had, crunchy, pick it up and eat it), always-always Caribbean Black Beans and Jerk Fried Rice.  Great place for kids, families, friends.  Casual, easy, feels great.  Literally enough food for 2 full meals.  All meals served with a homemade, warm SnickerDoodle cookie (as if you could possibly eat that after the 2-3 pounds in your order).  I love this place and would highly recommend it.

My first experience at a Brazillian Steak House.  Have had much feedback on this and other Brazillian Steak House restaurants and had relatively high expectations, but tried to keep an open mind and not be too tainted.  Salad bar was fair at best.  Item choices were limited and although I am easy to please and have a forgiving pallate, some items really did not taste good.  It was dimly lighted and I believe this was in some part an effort to "shelter" the low qualtiy food/serving station.  The meat on skewers that was brought around was also fair - not bad, but I would say a 7 on a 10 point scale overall.  What I looked forward to as the best meat, prime rib and ribs, were fatty and tough and without much flavor.  Most of the skewers were down to the last bits by the time they made it to our table.  The sausage selection was limited to one and was very greasy.  I like a bit of grease, but these were not great.  The ham was the best of all the meats.  Had a decent bottle of Chilean wine without breaking the bank - this was good.  The atmosphere was also fair.  A huge room with tables basically laid out like end-to-end picnic tables.  We sat against the wall and were about 2-3 feet from our neighbor - a bit close.  Overall I would say it was a reasonable experience, good date, nice bottle of wine, but I would not return to this restaurant.

Holy crap!! Huge portions, outstanding quality, fantastic service! Who thinks to put red skinned mashed potatoes, homemade biscuit, sage fried chicken, spinach, applewood smoked bacon, eggs, hollandaise and chili cream sauce together?? This place,....and thank goodness they did,.....original and amazing!!! Soooo worth the 20 minute wait!!! Highly recommended!!! Come to the freestanding location, I hear it's better than the one in the casino. Atmosphere here is fun, a little loud and very friendly :-)

Love this place!! Okay, sometimes the service is a little slow,....of course it's busy for a reason. The food is fantastic, fresh, presentation is outstanding, the people are friendly and the prices are incredible.  There's also a reason it's packed with people of Asian descent. True, the decor isn't Beverly Hills, but if you're more concerned with quality and value over atmosphere, this is a "must visit" locally owned, family friendly, neighborhood place.

I was a bit worried when I read some of the previous negative reviews,....okay, more than a bit worried, very worried. I felt like with my dog's eye condition, I didn't have much choice if I wanted to see a specialist. I went with as positive an attitude as I could and hoped for the best.  Surprisingly and thankfully, my experience was great. We were seen right on time. The facility was clean and modern. The tech was super nice, caring, and more knowledgeable than I would have expected from a tech. The doc was the dark curly haired lady from other posts, her name is Dr. Lisa Felchle. I found her to be caring, friendly and concerned. She was also extremely knowledgeable about my dog's eye condition, that it is congenital for this type of dog, exactly what is needed, what to expect, etc. She also didn't push me for extra services or medications. In fact, she and the tech pointed out that one of the drops may be less expensive at Walmart than buying/renewing directly from them. She was great and I was happily surprised with the whole experience.  Less than 2 months ago, I had a bad and very expensive experience at the animal hospital that is attached to Eye Care for Animals. I was strapped with a $1,500 bill with no diagnosis, no medicine, no idea what the problem was, no idea why it happened, and no idea how to keep it from happening again. The vet/doc was about 26 years old, was clearly fresh out of school and had no idea what was happening or how to communicate - she used every medical term she heard in school and was nebulous and confusing about everything, nothing was clear no matter how much we asked, all we heard was "we don't know". So, when I knew we were coming next door to Eye Care for Animals, I was understandably concerned we'd have the same experience.  But, Eye Care for Animals was great and the opposite of the animal hospital next door. I wanted to comment because based on my experience, they genuinely earned a positive review. If you have to go, I hope your experience is as positive as mine.

Great, fresh food,...very healthy!!  Portions are huge and the Pho is great too.  Excellent prices.  Service is super friendly, attentive...feels like family. Atmosphere is calming, open, clean and comfortable. It's surprising that such an excellent place is in such a slow corner strip mall, but very nice.  I wish I could give another 1/2 star,.....only took a half off because the flavor is a little bland, but that may be all Vietnamese food,....this food tastes very fresh and authentic!!  Definitely the best Vietnamese food I've had of the 4 places I've been!!  Highly recommend trying it, you won't be sorry.

Haven't been back in years. Why? Well, I eat just about any food and find something positive in everything. The food here,...terrible. Not just okay, actually tasted bad,....that's hard to do. I tried it twice, same experience both times.

The service alone makes this place a five-star restaurant. However, the food was spectacular as well! Fresh, flavorful, hot and served with style and a friendly smile. Highly recommend this small trattoria amidst the myriad of stores and other food options, don't miss it!

This was an unfortunate experience. I had such high hopes, especially seeing 4 of 5 stars on average. Not our experience,...and we usually have pretty good experiences. The hostess was unfriendly and had no knowledge of the restaurant. I thought I had been here a few years back so I asked her what it used to be called. She had no idea. I asked how long it had been there, no idea. She was much more interested in complaining about something with a waitress. No greeting, no smile, really seemed we were a burden (or a process) more than patrons.  On to the waitress. Not friendly, not pleasant and totally ignorant of the food, drinks and restaurant. I asked her the same question "I think I was here years ago, did this recently change owners?", I said. "I don't know", she said. Her description of the special of the day was hilarious: "It's like potatoes with onions in it and a vegetable,....(long pause),....with meat." Mmmmmm, sounds awesome, meat, I'll have that, thanks for being so specific....uuuh."Can you tell me what kind of "meat" it is?", I asked. She said, "Let me go check." She came back and told us it was Filet Mignon. Haha, ummmm, shouldn't you lead with that??? And, shouldn't you know that???  It was not a very busy night, very slow for a Friday night, literally about 8 other tables. I was less shocked after experiencing the hostess and waitress.  The drinks she brought us were bad after bad after really nasty. Seriously, there were 4 of us and all our drinks (all different) were bad. Dirty glasses, poorly mixed, poor quality. The sangria was nasty, super sweet, tasted bad. 2-3 glasses of wine were poor quality and gross. We drink red wine out a lot and have never had an experience like this. The food was acceptable. Not spectacular, not terrible,....got the burger, was basically taste-less. It was fair. The best part about the place, by far, was sitting in the little courtyard.  Would I go back? Nope. I'd Yelp and try somewhere else nearby, there are lots of places close.

Fantastic atmosphere.  Super friendly staff.  Very authentic Irish food and drinks.  Excellent beer and spirit options.  Very nice food selection and good quality.  Owners are extremely friendly, genuine, thoughtful people.  Have been once and plan to go again next Thursday after work for a pint and happy hour.  My style is to enjoy good food, drinks and conversation with a couple friends without loud, obnoxious patrons, getting drunk or overwhelmingly loud music.  Relax, enjoy the moment, the company, the food and the drinks in a place like Robbie Fox's.  This is an exceptional place for doing just that.

I eat here regularly at work. Of all the sub shops, I think this place is toward the top of the list for food, and definitely top for service most of the time.  They put a lot of meat on the sandwiches, veggies are fresh and the staff is pretty regular and very friendly.  As for value, I'd say this is one of the best, blowing away the other larger chains.

There is nothing special about this place except maybe the name and location - although even those are not that special. Yes, it's in a cool old house in an interesting part of town.  But, is that what one goes to a restaurant for? Not so much. Lets talk food, prices and service.  Food & Prices = honestly, foods are a 5 on a 10 point scale. We had about 6 things. Each was "fair". The presentations were nice and they looked like they'd taste great. But each was just okay. For example, snap peas, they are good by nature,....right? Spruce all 14 of them up with a bit of peanut sauce and theoretically they're even better, and maybe they are a little bit.  Then, however, dump on a cup full of dried, store bought fish flakes and some cayenne pepper and what do you have? Something that started pretty good and got, well, strange and not appealing.  And for this you'll get to pay around $10-15.  Same with the raw/seared tuna. Sounds great, right? Now, take the 8 tiny pieces of fish, pour a cup of bland (but colorful) beet paste around it, place 4 micro-chunks of yellowish beet smaller than a sugar cube next to it and lay it appealingly on a plate for $14-$16 and viola, you have an unremarkable, mediocre 1/3 of an appetizer for the price of an entree anywhere else. And the end pieces were half cooked and fishy tasting.  We had 4 pieces of "sushi" for about $15. They looked really cool, and if that's important to you, you'll like this place. Each of the 4 pieces was its own little package and the taste was bland, boring.  Honestly the other items were so underwhelming that they aren't worth mentioning.  Service = this is odd. It seems the employees can't quite figure out what kind of "trendy" this place is.  Is it tree-hugger'ish, hemp skirts and crunchy trendy? Is it tattooed and pierced trendy? Is it red hair and dark eye makeup trendy?  It was some kind of strange conglomeration. What it WASN'T,....was "friendly trendy". Our dark haired, 30-something, drab personality waitress literally didn't smile once. She was there in body, but not in spirit or personality, for sure. This was clearly a job and there was no room for any enjoyment.   Overall, we spent $100 and 1/2 way through we literally discussed what we'd be ordering at In N Out Burger on the way home.  My recommendation: skip this place. There are some really cool places to eat "downtown" that have better food, more of it, way better tasting, better attitude and much more reasonably priced. This is, of course, unless you are one that loves to tell your friends that you ate at this cool, trendy little place in a really small old neat house and the food was soooo good, knowing in the back of your mind that it was mediocre at best and you wish you'd have eaten elsewhere.

In mid October I had a poor and very expensive experience at this animal hospital. I was strapped with a $1,500 bill with no diagnosis, no medicine, no idea what the problem was, no idea why it happened, and no idea how to keep it from happening again. The vet/doc was about 26 years old, she was clearly fresh out of school and had no idea what was happening or how to communicate. She was not the primary vet that took care of my dog when brought in. She was the late night vet and our case was turned over to her. She seemed totally unprepared. Should she know everything since she didn't run the tests on my dog? Maybe not. But, the vets have a case review and transition of every patient before they transition out for the evening and she knew we were picking up our dog shortly. She simply had no idea what was happening and left us feeling completely neglected. Her communication was terrible. She seemed to use every medical term she heard in school, rather than explaining what was found (because she didn't know). She was nebulous, generic and confusing about everything, nothing was clear no matter how we asked, all we heard was "we don't know". In the absence of any and all useful information, I asked about trying various over the counter medicines that seemed to relate to the symptoms, her response was "I think so, you can probably try those". Really? You "think so" and I can "probably" try them? They "might" be okay?  What was I paying for? I could have come to the wise and educated conclusion of "probably, I think so, and it might" all on my own for a lot less than $1,500.  While they ran numerous very expensive tests to try and figure out what was wrong, she literally couldn't explain why things were done and what the results meant. They are getting 2 stars because it seems they tried to figure out what was happening, which was good, and although our vet did not seem knowledgeable about our situation whatsoever, she was "friendly". Of course, in an emergency situation, you hope for more than "friendly", knowledgeable and competent would be good. She generated absolutely no confidence whatsoever, was totally unprepared and left us feeling upset that we then had a very, very expensive bill and not a single question answered. The gal up front checking people in was not very friendly either. Overall, I'd try a different emergency clinic next time.

The best yogurt shop I've been to!  Why?  Yogurt is fantastic,...fresh, no weird chemical taste like at some other shops,....made daily with fresh, natural ingredients.  The owner, Duc (pronounced Duke) and his wife are awesome, friendly, genuine people.  Great, bright, positive, clean, happy atmosphere.  A neighborhood favorite!

Honestly, everyone from the ladies up front that greet you, the techs and all the people in back, to Dr. Wright himself, everyone is incredibly friendly, positive, helpful and caring. It is extremely clear that this is a friendly work environment where everyone enjoys the company of the other employees. Where Dr. Wright allows his staff a sense of freedom and autonomy, while clearly still maintaining professionalism. This breeds a positive environment, and experience, for both employees and patients. It's really great to see employees smiling, happily greeting patients and family members, and providing positive, happy, caring services. The whole environment is rare and missing in many other companies today.  I believe Wright Orthodontics would be an excellent case study on "what works" in the medical/dental (and other) services field. Other companies could learn from it and adopt some of the same practices. Whatever these practices are, please don't change them. You've created a "special sauce" in my opinion.  I've had 2 kids come through Dr. Wright's office over the last 3 years. Every visit, I mean each and every one, and each interaction, has been excellent. Even when there was an insurance payment snag several years ago, the situation is always handled with a smile and "unconditional positive regard". I have yet to experience anyone with this company that is not genuinely concerned and caring.  I'll be glad to be done paying for braces after all these years, but if I had to do it again, I would not hesitate one second to go back to Wright Orthodontics. I literally wouldn't even look at another provider.

This place, the staff, the food feel like home!! THE BEST!!!!

Wow, what a disappointment. In what aspects? Honestly, all aspects. Here's some detail.....  Service: We sat for about 10 minutes before anyone filled water (sat with empty glasses), had to ask for more water 3 times throughout the meal, waitress was on her first day on her own, which I get, everyone has a first day, but she didn't know the menu, never had any desserts so couldn't recommend one and when we asked what we should get "to go", she said she wouldn't know, bizarre! Saw our bus boy twice, no water, dirty table.  Honestly on a 10 point scale, service was a 3.  Food: mediocre at best. Absolutely not James Beard quality. Why? Steak absolutely unflavorful, guacamole was an avocado with no spices and a sprinkle of Mexican cheese,..,for $10.  Fish tacos had a nice chipotle sauce, but it was over a fish stick, poor. Dessert was a chocolate torte. Literally, the chocolate layer cake (cupcake) was out of the freezer. The little chocolate log was okay. Food on s scale of 1 to 10 was maybe a 5.  Atmosphere: cheap and strange. Trying to be eclectic, but it just seems "forced". The hotel it's in is clearly a "pig wearing lipstick". It's an old hotel that has been poorly kept up and painted in funky colors and with unusual "amenities" that simply make it feel like what it is, an older, poorly maintained building that is trying to be trendy in a K-Mart/IKEA kind of way.  Summary: There's definitely a reason you see this restaurant on Groupon. They need to get people in the door and the food, service and value aren't doing it. AZ88 next door was packed and known for good food and service. But, this place was pretty empty, for good reason. Expensive for mediocre food and poor service. If this is an award winning restaurant, they are clearly missing some critical controls to keep it worthy. My prediction, this place won't make it. Here's a good way to gauge, if I were in the area again, I would rather try just about any unknown restaurant than go back to Distrito.

I've driven by this place for years and given it's location, I wouldn't even consider stopping. Then somebody mentioned it and I checked out the reviews, so I gave it a shot. It's a tiny place inside, literally six tables. You may have to wait a couple minutes to be seated, but it's worth it. Why? Read on...  Atmosphere: tiny and not the cleanest, a true "hole in the wall", the kind of place for me. Why? The food:  it's excellent, high-quality, fresh, clearly made with care and from what seems like "old world" recipes. Spices are well-balanced and the tastes are clean. Prices are outstanding, well under $10 for a full lunch and you will get plenty of food. The service is always friendly, courteous and with a smile.  It's really hard to beat this little "joint". They seem to have the right combination. It's certainly not a Flemings or Nortons type of atmosphere. But, if you appreciate good food with excellent quality, good portions, great service and a genuine "non-chain", privately owned, local restaurant, don't miss this one.

Super nice people, very friendly, clean location. Yogurt machines are not self-serve, not well marked and the yogurt is not quite up to "fair". The flavors are so strong that they are overpowering and taste like concentrated everything. Only a couple flavor choices.

This place was "fair, at best". On a 10 point scale, I'd give it a 5.  Why? Read on....  Atmosphere = 5 out of 10 - cold, hard, not warm, no abmience, old stereo in corner with wires everywhere, things stapled to walls, felt dirty. Not great.  Food quality/taste = 6 out of 10 - this was not great Mediterranean food, had some strange textures and bland sauces. All food served on paper/plastic/Styrofoam throw away plates  Food portion size = 6 out of 10 - not great, fair at best, kind of small, particularly for the price  Service = 7 of 10, people were okay, seemed like a "job", the apparent manager (?) seemed nicest  Price/value = 6 out of 10. Really not great. The taste was not great, the portions were not great, the atmosphere was not great, and the price was at least $8-$11 per person for bland/poor food served on throw away paper-goods.   -- Would I go back? No, I honestly would not go back. This was altogether not a good combination. Terrible? No. Good? No.  I'd try any other place close by. I've had much, much better Mediterranean food. 3 places come to mind that are not far away and are stellar. I believe I've reviewed each of them before; Pita Bistro, Haji-Baba and Byblos. The first 2 are the same price as this Tzikii Pita Grill, or less, and much, much better in every way. The last, Byblos, is more of a sit down, traditional old school recipes, run by the grandparents and sooo good!

To be honest, I don't trust many people with my cars, I'm a skeptic and feel like many are out there to rip people off.  I read the reviews on Slaughter and called.  Brian answered the phone.  He was friendly, helpful, seemed honest and was a good communicator, all great qualities.  He gave me a quote for what I needed done, front axles, joints and boots for a Mazda Millenia, He offered the most competitive price and was honest about his work load, delivery time and ability.  It was very clear that he owns this company and takes pride in it.  Actually, I think he said that.  He gave me the peace of mind and confidence I needed to give him a shot.  The car was ready when he said it would be and has performed exactly as it should.  He even said the rest of the car was in great shape and needed nothing.  I appreciated the honest service, timeliness and above all else, the accurate, clear, honest communication.  I will definitely be back and I recommend Brian's work.

I've eaten at quite a few Thai restaurants here in the valley and just tried this one tonight for the first time. When you first enter, you realize how well laid out this restaurant is, not super formal, not super casual, somewhere comfortable in between. It's spacious and well laid out. We were greeted with a friendly smile and taken immediately to a comfortable booth.  The service was prompt and extremely friendly. The restaurant is clean and comfortable. We ordered satay chicken appetizer and a few entrées.  The satay chicken was the best I've ever had. It was served with the best peanut sauce and cucumber sauce I've ever had as well. The Penang and pad Thai were incredible, also the best I've ever had. My Mom's dish had chicken and shrimp and mushrooms and a sweet brown sauce, can't remember the name, but it was delicious! For dessert, we had coconut ice cream. Again, the creamiest, best coconut ice cream I've ever had in any Thai restaurant or possibly anywhere else. The food was hands-down excellent.  So, here are my ratings: atmosphere is an eight. Service is a 9.5. Food quality, taste, temperature, spice and quantity were outstanding, 9.5.  Presentation is beautiful.  This place is clearly not a chain type restaurant. Not exactly a hole in the wall either. It is clearly privately owned by people with old world recipes, quality ingredients, and truly care about the experience of eating in this restaurant. It seems to be frequented by Asian folks, and they clearly know their Thai food.  Of all the Thai restaurants I've been to in Arizona, I would return here first, hands down.  Highly recommended.

Over 400 reviews and still five stars, there's a reason. want a true, unbiased, fair, real - person review? Read on.  This was my first trip after hearing about this place several times and had no idea what to expect, except what I heard was incredible barbecue. I pulled into the parking lot to find a parking attendant helping people find a spot. What? At a little barbecue joint in a business part of Phoenix? Then I saw the line. Apparently it wasn't that bad, it was only about 12 people deep. I understand it can get to 50 people deep and over an hour. Fortunately, there was a mist system as we stood outside, some small shade trees and the parking attendant offered me a small bottle of cold water, very, very cool!  People in line had clearly been here before. They talked about "lamb neck" and "fatty brisket". Apparently the brisket goes quick! Heard a couple guys say they just flew in and came straight here, must be amazing, couldn't wait as I stood beside the large smokers and smelled the food smoking, was a cool experience.  Saw the owner, Scott, who I didn't know, walk by several times and was very talkative and friendly with everyone. My turn to meet him was coming, unbeknownst to me.  I walked in the door and watched the carvers making plates for everyone and they looked amazing! When it was my turn, the carver gave me a small "burnt end" of brisket, best I've ever tasted, ever! Now I was excited! They were out of fatty brisket, so I ordered a combination plate with chopped brisket, pork ribs and sausage. Had cheddar jalapeno grits and potato salad on the side with pickles, onions, jalapeno and two slices of white bread. Total with a 15% tip was about $25. Pretty expensive for lunch, but this was enough food to feed a small country and was about to see if it was worth it. I ate outside next to the meat smokers, loved the low key, local feel.  Scott came and talked to me for about five minutes and is a genuinely good hearted, down-to-earth, nice, approachable, friendly human, made the experience even better. The food was really good. I think I may have let the brisket sit too long and get a little dry, of course, it was chopped brisket, not sliced brisket, so that is going to happen, unfortunately.  But how does one person eat 6 pounds (not really) of food that fast :-)  Was most excited about the brisket, but found the pork ribs to be over-the-top fantastic. The grits and potato salad were good, I'd give them 7.5 out of 10. The brisket I'd give 8.5 out of 10. I'm guessing the fatty brisket would have been a 12 out of 10. The pork ribs were a strong nine or 9.5 out of 10, they were delicious!  I wasn't in love with the sausage, although it was incredibly high quality and clearly home made, I'd still give them a strong 7.5 or eight out of 10. The sides were good, nothing outrageous, unusual to find cheddar jalapeno grits, so they get extra points for that.  Overall, I'd say, if you're within a 20 mile radius and you don't have to wait too terribly long, I'd highly recommend stopping in, you will never forget it and I bet you'll find something you like better here then anywhere you've ever had. You absolutely won't go wrong giving Little Miss a try!

This is definitely a sole proprietorship, home grow, family run business. Love that. The mom and pop that run it clearly have a passion for their business. We were one of two tables when we came in, one more couple came in while we were there. Here's my ratings:  Atmosphere: it's a pretty generic little strip mall place. I like that you can see into the kitchen. It's clean, spacious and basic. It's one of those places where you know the owners care more about the food than the decorating, not a bad thing.  Food: the food is good. I got a dish I normally wouldn't, small ground chicken patties with spices, rice and salad. The chicken was good, moist, tasty. Wouldn't be my first choice again, but that's on me, not them. The rice was probably the best I've ever had, seriously, rice! Weird right? Don't know if it was special Turkish rice, but it looked like white rice. It was delicious. The falafel was outstanding! It was in my top 3 falafel I've ever had. When we checked-in, we got a free Turkish tea. She gave us 2, very sweet. It was very good.  Service: the mom and pop were very genuine and attentive. The mom was very sweet. The pop was quiet and was not "Mr. Happy and Social", maybe due to a language barrier or something, but he was attentive and took good care of us. Clear they care about quality of food and service. For me, this is key.  Quality and Value: very clear the quality is high. The taste was authentic, clean, flavorful and obviously made with care, old school recipes and high quality ingredients. We ate 2 meals for about $20 and were both full and satisfied when we left. Quality and value are both very good.  Overall I'd definitely recommend stopping in if you're in the neighborhood or even making a reasonable special trip to try it. Service, taste, quality and value are really good. I'm not often interested in atmosphere and decorating, I'm into great food, supporting sole proprietorships, off the beaten path, worthy places and this is one. You won't go wrong giving them a shot.

The food here tastes very fresh.  The staff is friendly.  The prices are reasonable.  The portions are excellent - particularly if you make your own bowl, then it's huge and delicious!  The atmosphere is light and casual.  Not sure what else to say except I eat here regularly because it is always an excellent experience.

Very surprised by the mixed reviews. I went there for the second time today since the reopening. Wanted to make sure my first time wasn't a fluke. Both times were excellent. I arrived shortly after they opened at 11:00 AM, so there was plenty of staff, maybe that's not always the case, but in my case, there were friendly servers and bartenders everywhere. Everyone smiles and says hello, very friendly and warm and nice.  The lunch menu has a fantastic selection, salads, burgers, chicken sandwich, pizza and fantastic appetizer selections. My colleague and I both had the Cobb salad last time. We were told that most people don't finish it, I can see why, it was enormous, fresh and excellent. Prices are very reasonable for the quality and portion size. Today, I had the Alpine Swiss burger. It is more like an artesian burger, prepared beautifully, excellent toppings, very fresh, well put together. The steak fries were outstanding and they have fantastic ranch dressing!  In my humble opinion, this is one of the best restaurants anywhere near Tempe marketplace, blows the others away by far. I would definitely recommend going for the atmosphere, which is really cool, the service, prices, quality, and friendliness of staff.

As you drive down the street to Snooze AM, not many places appear busy, except this place. It was packed, many standing around the hostess stand waiting for their text that their table is ready. Love the text idea and great they don't spam you with ads and such afterwards. We waited quite a bit to sit, longer than they quoted, but they are super friendly and have water and coffee out and offered to you as you wait, worth it!  The atmosphere and decorating are great, super modern, progressive and clean, bright and fun. The service was extremely friendly, from the host/hostess, wait staff and bussers.  The menu is enormous and everything sounds amazing. Ingredients are fresh, local, highest quality and dishes are creative, full of unique flavor and extremely well presented. Everything we had was absolutely delicious. We ordered way too much food because everything sounded phenomenal, and it was! Prices are a little high, but well worth it, really.  It's not close for me to go, but absolutely worth it. The pairing of excellent service, stellar, fresh, balanced, tasty, unique food, good value, and a really fun, bright, clean, active atmosphere make this a fantastic breakfast choice on any given day. Go, enjoy, you'll be glad you did!

Passed by this little "hole in the wall" dozens of times, never went.  Now I regret that.  The atmosphere is very casual and the staff is friendly.  It's a good sign when you see older Mexican ladies cooking in the back and patrons of Hispanic descent (ooh, that was really, really p.c.) at tables all around you.  The portions are sizable and the food tastes authentic.  The tortillas are excellent, large, thin, soft, warm.  Only tortillas that compare are Carolina's.  There were a couple food items that looked a bit different, maybe strange, but they were delicious.  The carne asada was like nothing I'd seen.  It looks like ground beef or some kind of soilant-green meat product,...sorry, sounds gross,....but it was really good and tasty.  I had low hopes for the guacamole when it came out and looked very smooth and maybe from a package.  But, I was wrong, it was excellent!  Beans looked a bit runny, but very flavorful and delicious!  Rice, excellent!!  Chicken asada, very soft and flavorful. The pico was super fresh and chilled,....salsa was fantastic and spicy.  Overall, I thought this was one of the best tasting Mexican Restaurants I have been to in quite a while and I already look forward to returning.  I'd definitely recommend it for out-of-towners looking for authentic Mexican cuisine, family fun, relaxing dinners or a night out with friends.

What a great surprise and a gem of a find! While some of the servers are quite young and clearly learning the ropes (we all learn somewhere, sometime), the service was excellent and the food was great. It is shocking that this place was a McDonalds for many, many years, you'd never know it,...and I know it! They did a fantastic job remodeling and rebuilding to make it very open, lively, warm, welcoming and a fun atmosphere.  The food was excellent!  All the ingredients were clearly fresh and each plate made to order. Spices were alive and spot on. Drinks were excellent! We went during happy hour and the value was incredible!! We had 4 or 5 appetizers, where were all good size and 2 drinks and the bill was less than $30,...and we were both stuffed and very, very satisfied! The manager stopped by to say hi and he was a super friendly, knowledgeable, caring guy, that was great.  This is seriously one of the best restaurants in the area. We only had appetizers and drinks but the entrees on the other tables looked delicious and huge and steamy hot!! I can't wait to go back and try them. If they are as good as the apps and drinks we had, I may need to "up" my review to even higher.  Really, stop in and try this hidden little gem, you won't be sorry!!!

Here are my rated attributes each on a 10 point scale....10 being highest of course:  Service = 8.5, very friendly and prompt Food Quality = 9, fantastic presentation and quality Portion Size = 6, pretty small Food Prices = 6, pretty expensive for the size Ambience = 7, cool looking, but very loud, cramped and only high tables Drink Selection = 9, vast and interesting selections Drink Prices = 6, pretty pricey, $10   Overall, I'd give this restaurant a 7.5 out of 10. Definitely fun, good service, great presentation of quality food. A bit small inside, small portions, pricey and loud. Would I rush back if there were other places nearby that I hadn't tried? No. If I was out with friends and they wanted to go, would I go back? Yes. Certainly worth trying in my opinion.
