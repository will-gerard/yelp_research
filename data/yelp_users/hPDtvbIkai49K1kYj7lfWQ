Lovely atmosphere and great view of the golf course. We sat outside and it was lovely.  The food was very tasty with some variations on the traditional menus. Service was excellent. Our waitress was very attentive, she even brought us an extra cookie at the end of the night.

I have been working for years with Lake Pleasant Dentistry and Dr. Sharon. I am extremely confident in her abilities to handle any situation a patient will need. I've referred many patients to her office over the years and I am a patient myself. She is especially good with handling young children. Check out their office it has all the modern equipment and the staff are always willing to help you.

We went out with 2 couples for our monthly group dinner exploring different local restaurants.  We were not disappointed.  The food and service were top notch. Everyone had a great time. I had chopped salad, braised ribs, pecan pie. All were very good. I would definitely go again.

We went for my wife's birthday with another couple. We had a great time. The service was excellent. The food was really good with a varying selection of different tastes that played on comfort food.  The atmosphere was really happening. Not very quite or romantic, but a good place to party with a group.

My son just had to go hear. I promised him I would take him to a bouncy house. He is 5 and had a ball. But in my opinion the place could be much better. There is potential, but the biggest problem I could was understaffing. There seemed to be only 2 employees trying to run the whole place.  While they were great with the kids, there was just too much for them to do. Supervision, checkin, food and many more things to do. Give your employees more help and you should do great.

Took my staff out for Lunch.  We had a great time.  Food was very good with great variety.  That atmosphere was extremely unique.  Blending a sports bar with a Chinese food.

I ate lunch here today for the first time. I didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised. Call it British comfort food. My belly was full and I felt great. All they needed was a few couches to go curl up for a nap. I'll be back.
