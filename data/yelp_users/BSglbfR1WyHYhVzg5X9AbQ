Have loved this place since I was 14 years old and an avid pothead. Nowadays I can't smoke, but this place will still be the best munchie cure on this side of the Valley!

I'm just going to note that most of the people who have posted bad reviews and complaints about scheduling are walk-ins. Like any typical nail salon, I feel like it is common sense to call ahead and make an appointment, or at least check and see how busy a place may be before going there. I understand that they do take walk-ins, but you have to realize how busy they may be at any given time. It is worth the call ahead to make an appointment at this location. I have been going here for about 4 months now and never had a bad experience. I have been treated with kindness and courteousness by every employee that works there. The nail techs are phenomenal and take time to make sure that their work is impeccably done. I would definitely recommend this nail salon!

Went here with my fellow classmates for some brunch in between classes. It was my first time there and I had never heard of this restaurant before, but I am so glad that I stopped in for a bite to eat! Our server was very accommodating of our short break and made sure to get our orders out as fast as possible. All of the orders were accurate and they were brought out within 10 minutes. The food is extremely fresh and it is clear that this establishment cares about the health of their customers. Each of the dishes on their menu were healthy options and alternatives as opposed to going somewhere such as Denny's or IHOP and getting low-grade food. I will definitely be back here soon!

Although the staff was friendly and helpful, the quality of the pizza was horrible. Cheese was not even cooked to the pizza dough properly and was loaded onto a double pepperoni when I specifically asked for no top cheese. I am well aware that pizza is greasy,  but the amount of grease from one slice of it alone was enough to soak up two napkins. I don't care how great of deals that they give out on their coupons, personally it is not worth it to me. Will not be going back here ever again. Much better pizza out there folks!!

Even if I was drunk I would avoid this place like the plague. Every time I have gone in they have messed up my order, without fail. Tried to place a little bit of faith in them after the first two times, but that was a huge mistake. Honestly, when I am ordering a simple salad and having to repeat myself 3 times to the cashier each time and then getting my food and having it be a sub is more than ridiculous. Not to mention the manager gets very defensive even though it is clearly THEIR ERROR. What a joke. I will definitely find something else nearby.

My food was brought to me COLD. I don't really think I need to say much more. If you want a good burger, go to Habit, Burger Fi, or Rehab Burger. Stay far, far away from this horrendous place.

I don't know if it's bad luck or what, but every time I come here I always get very bad service from the waiting staff. Every time that I have come with one of my friends, it has been pretty empty in the restaurant. Yet still, we have waited almost 20 minutes to even get greeted by a server and even longer for drink refills. The server that we get either doesn't care enough to provide even the minimum amount of good customer service (and I am not a picky, mean, or difficult diner whatsoever) or they take our plates away before we even finish our food. It's very weird and awkward to say the least. Almost embarrassing since we have never had a bad experience with the food thus far.  For example, the other day when my friend and I were dining in for breakfast, we waited about 15 mins for a server to come greet us in an almost empty restaurant. Meanwhile, the waiting staff was laughing and gossiping up front instead of actually checking to see if anyone needs help or how their experience is. A random server/manager/whatever that works there decided to come ask us what we wanted to drink, and that our actual server would be right over. When he comes back with the drinks, our server just shows up and asks us if we are ready to order. NO NAME, NO GREETING, NOTHING. Her service was horrendous to say the least even after that defining moment. Surprised I even tipped for that. But I am not the type of person to stiff a waiter or waitress. Needless to say, I probably won't be coming back here.

Terrible service. Was given the complete wrong order and it also had a giant hair in it. Girl did not give me a receipt so they did not give me a refund, even though it was a food safety and sanitary issue. Never again! You suck Culvers!

I found Britt's Hair Chair through Yelp and I am so glad that I did! This woman worked pure magic on my hair and made it more beautiful than it has been in almost a decade! Not only does she have amazing talent, but she is also so very sweet and kind and an absolute joy to be around! You can talk to her just like she is one of your best friends. We chatted about anything and everything and before I knew it I had a beautiful new 'do! I would recommend her to all of my friends and family, and to those that are looking for a hairstylist that is truly passionate about her craft!

This place is absolutely fantastic! I have only really tried their burritos, tacos, and their ceviche, but from just that I have experienced such a pure, delicious, and authentic flavor that not many other restaurants possess. I am eager to try more of their menu in the future and also see what their spirits selection is like. Especially the hand crafted margaritas! Yum! They are very courteous and take pride in all of the food that they make, and it shows.

Make sure you check your pick up order, or just your order in general when coming to this place. The one I went to in Tempe brought my food out COLD. This location butchered a simple order with NO modifications whatsoever. I was also the only person in the restaurant at that time, so there was no excuse. I ordered an a Avocado Ranch Black Bean Burger and there was NO avocado, no cheese, no ranch, and a piece of wilted lettuce. Needless to say, this place is garbage and it shows how much they care (which is little to none) . I don't eat fast food, so I have higher expectations for these fast casual burger places. It's pretty sad when a place like Burger King or Wendy's can make a better burger and not screw up as much as these guys do. If you are looking for a good burger, go to Habit, Burger Fi, or Rehab Burger in Old Town. Stay FAR, FAR AWAY from this place.

The staff here is never welcoming, rather they just stand there, say nothing, and don't greet you when you walk in. That should have been my first clue. My first couple times here were alright, no noticeable problems other than the fact that you have to yell to even be heard over the sneeze guard, and the cooks almost constantly get the order wrong and it has to be remade before it hits the end of the line.  My most recent time here has caused me to never want to return again. I went there when it wasn't that busy at all, so I figured it wouldn't be too bad. I usually order steak tacos for my boyfriend and a chicken salad for myself, pretty simple order with minimal alterations. When I went up to order and told them I wanted the steak tacos, the kid that was taking my order made a face at me and was silent (okay...wtf). I of course inquired why he was making the face and he finally answered that they were out of steak and in the process of making the next batch. Could have just said that from the start...awkward! Anyways, I end up waiting about 10 minutes for the steak to be ready. All the while the restaurant ends up emptying out until I am literally the only customer there. By the time they yell for me to inform me that the steak is ready and they are making my tacos, I go up to the register and my salad is already made. Weird, because I never told them what I wanted in there in the first place. So they rushed through making it for literally NO REASON. Hmm. I had it remade and to no surprise, as many other reviewers on here have noted, there was a chicken bone in my salad and the middle of the lettuce (which usually should never be in a quality salad) was in there and it literally looked like someone crapped out a salad and decided to sell it. Will never ever be coming back here again!

I have been to this place a few times before and had no problems, so I was confident that this time would be similar to the others. I was definitely wrong. When I went, it was around 45 minutes until they closed, so there was still plenty of time to order and get out in a reasonable amount of time. I never mind the waiting time, so that wasn't a problem. When I got my burger it was about 15 minutes until they closed and I needed to be home, so I headed back. When I got home and opened the burger, the center was bright red, NOT the "warm, pink center" that they are famous for. It was RARE. Went in the next business day to get my money back, because by the time I would have gone back the night before it would have been closed. I talked with the manager on duty, who was different than the one I had spoken to on the phone the night before. This one seriously sat there and stared at the receipt like it was some damn foreign language and then preceded to tell me that my rare burger was not rare, even though I had pictures of the BRIGHT RED center to prove it. Then she goes on to complain that I should have come in the night before so it would have been "easier for her and the restaurant"...okay kind of just told you my situation and why I am in today and couldn't come the night before. This is after telling her twice already! I seriously spent 15 minutes arguing with a half-wit "manager" about getting my money back. Didn't think it was that difficult, but I guess for Burger 21 it was. Never going back here again.

I have only been a patient here for a little over a month, but the wonderful care I have received makes me feel like I have been part of the family for a while. I first made an appointment after I had pretty much scoured my nearby in-network opthalmologists with absolutely no luck. I had a pretty bad cause of exotropia (aka outward lazy eye) that was causing intense migraines almost day in and day out. I had decided it was finally time to explore my treatment options. When I came across Eye Consultants of AZ, I was amazed at how quickly and easily I was able to make an appointment. Literally within the next day. Most providers I had spoken to had a waiting list until at least July. My initial consultation went extremely well and I was able to set up a surgery date within the month. It's been about a week since I had the surgery and it has literally changed my life. For the first time in years I don't have migraines or double vision. Dr. Lu is extremely knowledgable and has the best bedside manner I have ever seen in a provider. He takes the time to listen to your concerns, explain your condition, and go over ANY and ALL treatment options. He is very kind and friendly and always has a smile on his face. Also, his office staff are amazing and will be there to help you every step of the way! He will be the only opthalmologist I will trust from here on out!   THANK YOU DR. LU!

This location of Logan's is absolutely horrendous. I have come here with my roommate twice, and both times there have been issues. The first time that we came, we arrived on a weeknight when it wasn't crowded at all. There were many booths open and cleaned, so there was a lot of seating to choose from. The host that was there did not even bother to greet us. He just grabbed two menus and started walking, so  we followed behind. Okay... It gets worse though. Since we were not asked initially whether or not we wanted a booth or a table (as I stated before, there were many open ones) I asked very politely if we could sit at a nearby booth. Instead of responding, this host had the fucking nerve to ROLL HIS EYES and sigh loudly like we were some type of pain-in-the-ass to him - all over a very small and simple request. As soon as that happened, we turned right around and left the place. That experience alone wa s beyond appalling.  Our second time there, which we still were on edge about because of what happened the last time, proved to be another bad one for the books. Our server was very spacey and had each one of us repeat our orders at least 4 times. He acted very peculiar and took off with our menus without really saying anything to us or bothering to check up on us when we finally did get our meals, which was 45 minutes later. We came on a quiet night during the week again, so there were only two other tables that were occupied at the time. Both of our orders were messed up and had to be remade several times. Undercooked and rotten steak. Not to mention, we didn't even get the meals comped, so I just had it replaced with some chicken fingers (it's a miracle at this point that those weren't messed up either).  We have gone to the other Logan's location in Gilbert at San Tan Village and have never had a bad experience. If you are going to Logan's, I would recommend going to that location instead. Stay the hell away from this Riverview location!!!
