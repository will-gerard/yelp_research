We were just passing by and the eating options in Surprise, AZ were limited. I have to agree with others here, I will make sure NEVER to frequent this location again.  We purcased a kid meal for my son but they failed to tell us that they didn't have any juice boxes, or fruit squeezes, both of which was shown as part of the kids meals. Instead of the juice box, they gave us a small drink (after we already paid). But there were no options outside of soda (which we don't allow our kids to have) so we ended up essentially paying for ice water! As for the fruit squeeze, they gave us an extra mac-n-cheese. Problem is, we didn't select that side. I guess they just figured they'd make our decision for us.   I ordered a 3-piece meal that included two sides and a medium drink. Total came out to $9.84! Call me cheap but I think that is a bit pricey for fast food meal.

I've decided to base this review on my wife's opinion of the food here because I tend to be too strict on these types of establishments having frequented close to 100 different Pho places.   As for food, she rates this place an 8 of 10. For service, granted they were busy, it was just a 6 of 10. If I could have rated them a 3.5, I would have. But between a 3 and a 4, I had to choose 4 because the food was pretty good.   As for parking, the center is small and parking was a premium. We were early birds so we found parking, but as we were leaving, we can see people fighting for spots. Prepare your during popular dining hours.

Nice easy hike to the Hole in the Rock. We had our 3 and 6 year old and they had no problems getting to the hole. There is a path along the left side that has steps. There are smaller pebbles throughout that makes the path a bit slippery at times so go up slowly and watch your step. On the way back down we went the opposite way. It wasn't an actual pathway but it was still easy nevertheless, plus we got to see the hole from a different viewpoint.  The view from the top is amazing! You can see Papago Park, the Phoenix Zoo, ASU campus, and the airport. Go at sunrise or sunset for best views. We actually parked in the zoo parking lot but there are smaller parking lots closer to the trail head. Parking was free but we got there around 5:40pm, after zoo was already closed. We didn't see any place to pay for parking either so I'm guessing that it's always free.

We tried this place today. The food was a 4 out of 5 star, but I will admit that we got the food to go because we got their approximately 20 minutes until closing and didn't want to be rushed.  We order the Thai Basil with Chicken, Green Papaya Salad, and Beef Chow Mien Thai Style. For service, even though we order to go, I'd have to give them 5 out of 5. They gave each member of our family a scoop of green tea ice cream while we waited for our food! Food was well packaged and came with everything we needed which was helpful since we were going back to our hotel to eat our dinner.   This place is a hidden gem that is kind of squeezed in between a residential neighborhood. Without Yelp, we probably would have never discovered this place. A big thanks to the all the Yelp users who came here before us.

After reading other reviews here on Yelp, we decided to try Fired Pie for dinner.  They definitely didn't disappoint. Our family all did the build-your-own option. The size was plentiful as we all had left overs (which we plan to heat up for lunch tomorrow).  A pizza and drink was about $10, but considering that we will get two meals out of it, it's a great value to us.  It was walking distance from our hotel (Hilton Suites) so we didn't have to deal with parking. But we saw plenty of parking on a Sunday night. It's a bit tricky to find as they are kind of tucked away behind The Good Egg and Jimmy John's.
