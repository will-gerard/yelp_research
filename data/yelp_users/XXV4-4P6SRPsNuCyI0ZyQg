Imagine the mounting tension and excitement of walking terminal C with enough time to find a sit down restaurant and enjoy a leisurely lunch before your flight.  Then PeiWei appears like an oasis in this desert of junk food.  This is such a great feeling.  They have a nearly full menu to choose from, also a great sign.    Well that concludes the good news.   The food was mediocre.  I got the teriyaki chicken with brown rice.  The veggies were barely ok, the chicken was as dry as the Sahara desert, and the rice would have had more water content before being cooked.  The massive quantities of sauce could not rectify the problems and instead added to unpleasantness of this meal.    The only things on par with a regular PW would be soda and fortune cookie.    I'd opt for the fast food if I were you.  Their low rating is sadly well earned.

Dbat is the country's premiere indoor baseball and softball practice facility with world class instruction.  This facility is brand new as if March 2014.   Beautiful facility and friendly owners.
