What an awesome experience!  My husband and I were in the market for track lighting and carpeting.  After stopping at Lowe's and walking out empty handed because we couldn't find anyone to wait on us, we went to Home Depot.  I went to the carpet department and was immediately asked if I needed any help.  It was really my lucky day in getting Debi to assist me with all my carpeting questions.  She was a wealth of information and steered me to the best carpet for my money.  She sealed the deal and sold me a beautiful, thick, high quality carpet for a very reasonable price.  We then headed to the lighting department and got an older gentleman to help us there.  He was very helpful and spent a lot of time with us and went back and worth with us from electrical to lighting.  After this experience, I'll definitely be going to Home Depot first and I'll think twice about going to Lowe's anytime soon.

Carrabba's has always been one of my husband and my favorites.  We're always assured to have a good meal and good service, but tonight they were over the top!  We went in to celebrate our anniversary and they treated us like royalty.  Our waitress, Amanda, was exceptional right down to recommending an excellent bottle of wine.  The food was delicious and Chef Bryan stopped by to check up on us several times.  After the meal Amanda delivered a huge slice of chocolate chiffon cake with ice cream for our anniversary (compliments of management), and Chef Bryan threw in a glass of port wine to top off the chocolate...yum!  If you're looking for an exceptional meal with excellent service you can't go wrong with Carrabba's.  Highly recommended for special occasions.  This will be one anniversary we won't soon forget because of our special night out.  Thank you Carrabba's!

Always our favorite place to go for any special occasion.  My husband and I went back again for our 35th wedding anniversary on September 13th and again, Carrabba's did not disappoint.  Awesome food, good wine, romantic atmosphere, and excellent customer service.

I've been going to Dr. Peterson since he opened his practice, many, many years ago.  Prior to Dr. Peterson, 've always dreaded going to the dentist, but now I actually look forward to my appointments.  Dr. Peterson and his staff are always very friendly and professional, they treat my husband and I like family.  Amy, the hygientist, does an excellent job of cleaning my teeth while being very gentle.  I can't tell you how many I've been to that are so rough that your teeth hurt for days afterwards.  I can't say enough about what a wonderful find Dr. Peterson was.

My husband always chooses Watson's when he orders me flowers and they never disappoint.  I received an arrangement of white lilies with white babies breath on September 13th for our 35th wedding anniversary.  My husband didn't know the address of my office, but told them the name of the company and they took care of the rest.  My flowers arrived at the correct location, no problem.  The arrangement came with quite a few buds and one by one they all opened.  It is now September 21st and I still have one lily left.  I know I'll have to probably throw it out tomorrow, but the babies breath still look as good as they day they arrived.  Watson's always uses the freshest flowers that last days longer then any other florist's I've experienced.

Great find, located in a strip mall, not much from the outside, but great atmosphere on the inside. There's an awesome bar area that's elevated and separated from the regular dining area.  It has a wraparound bar with high top tables on either side. The mood is fun and the wait staff is awesome. The bar area has a separate menu with lots of great specials, but you can also order from the regular dinner menu if you'd like.  There is also a separate dining room that's quieter and has seating for larger groups.  However, in the dining room you can only order from the dinner menu.    The food is great, lots of selection and they bring as much garlic bread as you want.  The wait staff is friendly, helpful and very attentive.  They even package up the leftovers for you, in our case there was enough for another meal.

This is one of my favorite lunch locations, unfortunately I don't go often enough because it's not quite within walking distance of my office and requires getting in the car and driving.  I was lucky to get to go today for a friend's birthday, what an ethnic treat!   The food is always delicious, the hard part is deciding what 3 selections to pick, they're all so good.  It's located in a little strip mall, but they've made it nice and cozy inside, with ethnic colors, decorations, and music.  I always enjoy bringing along someone who's never been before, they're always pleasantly surprised.  This is a definite must do, you won't regret it.

I've always loved Rula Bula, but I have to tell you I went there for lunch last weekend during the Tempe Art Festival and they really out did themselves.  The place was packed, but we were warmly greeted and because we didn't mind a high-top table, we were promptly seated.  Our waitress was over the top....very friendly and attentive, as was all the wait staff.  We found out later that our waitress had 19 tables she was covering at that time, but you never would have known it.  The food was excellent, as always, the the drink was even better.

My morning ritual Monday through Friday is a trip to my local Starbucks.  The employees there are very friendly, knowledgeable and always treat me like family.  They make it a point to know your name and your drink preferences.  We often have our drinks waiting for us when we arrive because they've seen us across the street....now that's service.  What an awesome group of individuals, Starbucks should be proud.

This was my first time here since they expanded. The food was great as always and the service first rate, but now you can actually find a seat. They've done a great job on the expansion. They still maintained the old section but now have an additional bar section and large seating area on the other side. It's dark inside and the music is cranking, great atmosphere in my opinion. If you haven't been there in a while it's worth checking out again. A great location for happy hour as well. I would go back just for the Sonoran White Chocolate Ale.

Went back this afternoon to enjoy happy hour with my coworkers. We had a great time and I enjoyed more of the Sonoran White Chocolate Ale. The waitress was very nice, offered to provide us with separate checks and even took our picture for us.  I loved the music, nothing better then Led Zepplin, Buffalo Springfield, and all the other great 70's tunes they were playing.  The best part is getting dinner to go and enjoying pasties at home.

I went to this In-N-Out for lunch after spending a long hot morning at the Autoplex looking at cars.  It was a welcome relief to step into the cool restaurant and get a double double, fries and a LARGE iced tea to quench our thirst.  The meal was very good, the counter help was nice and the restaurant was clean, including the restroom.  The place was packed but we were lucky to score a table without any trouble.

Went here the other day for a quick lunch with my coworker....or so I thought!  We went at noon, which I know is a busy time, but it didn't look insanely busy to me.  I would think any restaurant should be prepared for a busy noon hour.  My friend and I both ordered salads and it literally took an hour to get our meals.  The girl seating people was very nice and apologetic, but even our waitress was unresponsive.  We also both ordered our salads with the dressing on the side and after an hour they couldn't even get that right.  My friend went ahead and ate hers as is, but I sent mine back.  The second salad came out very quickly which I was grateful for.  Since we were in a hurry at this point we asked for our checks immediately.  We had asked for separate checks, but when we got the check it was together.  The waitress took it back and separated them for us.  We both put our credit cards down immediately, but were almost done with our meals when I finally waved the checks at the waitress to pick up. The food wasn't bad, but I will never go back for such poor service!

My husband and I can always count on Lucky Lou's.  It consistently has great food and the wait staff is awesome!  It reminds me of Cheers, everyone knows everyone else and the wait staff remember you, what your favorite drink is and are always warm and friendly.  Did I mention they also have Four Peaks Kiltlifter on tap?    The bar is always full and multiple hightop tables, lots of TV's showing the current sports events.  The decor is 50's Las Vegas theme, with pics of the Rat Pack, and flashing lights and slot machines on the shelves.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed.

A couple weeks ago I tried their Grilled Chicken Salad and now I'm hooked.  I work nearby and it's a quick walk over to pick up something to go.  I went again last week and it was just as delicious.  They marinate the chicken for 48 hours then grill it and add spices.  I'm on a diet and love this salad because you can eat it without any dressing, the chicken is so good.  They put a ton of chicken on it and it also comes with a warm pita and a couple of different sauces.  I highly recommend it!

I've been to Danny's several times and every time I'm disappointed and wonder why I came back.  It is conveniently located, but that's about it.  My last experience I pulled in and my car was extremely dirty and had lots of bugs on the front grill and roof rack.  The attendant suggested I upgrade and spend $40 for the hand wash and wax.  I thought that would probably be a good idea and made sure I specified that the reason I was upgrading was to get all the bugs removed.  I was told it would take them about 45 minutes and I was willing to wait.  It ended up taking twice as long.  They did do a good job on parts of the car, but I still found bugs on the front grill.  When I mentioned it to the attendant he never offered to do anything about it and at this point I wasn't willing to wait any longer.  Unfortunately I forgot to tell them not to use Armor All on the inside of the car.  They used Armor All on everything....why do they think that's appropriate for the entire car?  I've tried rubbing most of it off and I know it'll eventually wear off, but really!  Also, they failed to rub out some of the wax and I ended up having to finish the job at home.  I will never, ever go back!

This is a great theater, always clean and not as crowded as the Harkins Theater at Superstition Springs.  We've watched numerous movies in the IMAX 3D theater and it's always a great experience.  The seats are comfy, popcorn is fresh and the soda is cold, what more could you want from a movie theater?

We've driven past RT O'Sullivan's a zillion times and always said we should eat there some time, but would always end up a BJ's instead.  We finally forced ourselves to stop and were we pleasantly surprised.  It's not much from the outside, looks like a dive bar.  The inside is dark as you would expect a sports bar to look, but it was very clean and had lots of TV's and seating options, including a large outdoor patio.  They had both Guiness and Four Peaks on tap and a wide selection of food.  I ordered the hot corned beef sandwich with a side salad and it was delicious.  The corned beef was lean and included melted cheese and Boar's Head deli mustard.  Just beware of the Leprechaun on the way to the restrooms, I'm sure I've seen him on some horror movies.  We will definitely go back and it might even become out new haunt.

BJ's is a regular haunt for my husband and I.  They have great selections of beer.  My favorite is the PM Porter.  The food is consistently good and they have an extensive menu.  My favorite is the shrimp tacos and my husband loves the french dip, their pizzas are also very good.  We always sit in the bar section, that eliminates the children, which can be noisy if you end up getting a table next to them.  The atmosphere is great, and the bar area has TV's with current sporting events playing.  The only downside is that the service isn't always great.  Also, I've witness the staff using the parking spots in the front for themselves.  This says to me the restaurant is poorly managed.  Fix that and you'd probably have a 5 star restaurant.

5th and Wine was recommended to me when I was searching for a place to hold our work holiday party. I read the Yelp reviews and decided it would be the perfect location. We had our party last Thursday. We had a party of 13 and I requested a table on the patio. The weather was perfect and they had the table all ready for us.  Our waitress was Nadine, she was awesome, she made sure we had everything we needed and was very attentive. There was live music on the patio shortly after we got there and they were great.  Some of us got there shortly before 6:00 and were able to take advantage of the great happy hour specials. Most of their wines being $5 per glass or $20 per bottle. I also bought another glass of wine at the full price of $10, but was able to get $2 off through Yelp when I checked in.  Some of the food was awesome, including the seasoned sweet potato fries, but other parts were disappointing. I got the portobello burger and the portobello mushroom was rather small. My husband got the prime rib special and the piece of meat was large and delicious, but the vegetables that came with it were almost non-existent.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant, the positives far out weighed the negatives.

I've started laser vein treatment on my legs and am very pleased with Dr. Osorio and the entire staff. The office is very clean and well equipped. Dr. Osorio reviews your prognosis and treatment plan and does a great job of explaining each step of the treatment and what to expect. I would highly recommend the Advanced Skin & Laser Center to anyone needing vein treatment.

I was so disappointed in my shopping experience this last weekend, or should I say my LACK of shopping experience.  My husband and I were in the market for two main purchases, track lighting and carpet.  We spent at least 15 minutes in the track lighting section and needed some help, but never saw any employees.  We then went over to the carpet section.  We were looking to replace our carpet in the living room and we were ready to make a decision.  We spent approximately 30 minutes in this area and even had a carpet picked out that we really like, but again we never saw any employees in this area either.  I heard other customer complaining as well.  Finally we abandon the few items we'd pick out to purchase and drove over to Home Depot.  They were awesome and ended up getting our business.

What an awesome place!  Everyone is so friendly and helpful.  You call up to refill a prescription and it's normally done within the hour.  Kelly at the counter is always so friendly and everyone greets you when you walk in the door.  I stop by religiously every month for my hormone fix and it's such a warm and wonderful experience.  Keep up the good work!

This is one of our normal haunts for lunch when we're out running errands on a Saturday.  We always eat in the bar area to avoid the children.  The atmosphere in the bar area is dark and cozy with lots of TV screens to watch your favorite sports teams.  They have a variety of seating options, the bar, high-top tables, booths, and an outdoor patio.  The food is consistently good and they have a great selection of beer, including Guinness.  I've tried a variety of menu items and have never had a bad meal.  I love the Apple Walnut salad that includes pecans and strawberries as well.  My husband likes the Torpedo and Calzone.  The wait staff (Darby, Heather, and James) are always friendly and attentive.

I frequent this Barro's almost once a week....yes I have a pizza addiction!  The pizza is always good and the wait staff is exceptional.  I normally call in my pizza order and then pick it up on the way home.  When I call they always know me by name and recognize that I'm a regular.  I rotate between three different pizza favors, BBQ Chicken (my favorite), Pepperoni/Sausage/Mushroom, and just a Cheese Pizza.  The pizza is consistently good.  The counter staff is always friendly and efficient.  You can tell this Barro's is very well managed.  I've never actually eaten in, so not sure about that experience.  The dining area is small and doesn't look appealing to me.

I stopped by Thai Patio for the first time on Friday.  I ordered dinner for my husband and I and got it to go.  I wanted a variety so I ordered two appetizers, the Satay Chicken and the Pot Stickers, and two entrees, the Orange Chicken and the Green Curry. Since my order was 'to go' I expected the food to be not as good as if I'd eaten it at the restaurant fresh.  At Thai Patio however, everything was packaged to ensure the best experience possible at home as well.  The pot stickers, which were a crispy variety, were put in a styrofoam container with a hole cut in the side to release the steam and remained crispy by the time I got home.  The entrées were packaged separately from the rice, so everything could be assembled fresh at home.  Portions were generous and we had enough for a second meal.  The Satay Chicken came with two dipping sauces, a peanut sauce and a cucumber dip, both were excellent.  If my theory on the 'to go' food not being as good as if it was eaten fresh at the restaurant then eating 'in' would probably have to be 6 stars.  You definitely must give this one a try.  I'm already looking forward to going back soon!

I've been to NCounter several times now and have always been very impressed with the food and the help.  On past visits I would have given them 4 stars, but today was a different story.  I was taking a friend out to lunch for her birthday and was very excited to take her to NCounter since she'd never been.  She ordered a sandwich with the salad and ended up finding a piece of a plastic wrapper in her sandwich.  She didn't make a big deal about it, but we felt we should let them know.  We told one of the wait staff and showed them the piece of plastic that was about the size of a quarter.  The girl did not apologize but did say she'd let the kitchen know about it.  I expected one of the management staff to come out and apologize, but no one did.  When we saw the girl again we asked if she'd let anyone know, she said yes and then she finally apologized for the incident.  We waited a while longer, still hoping we'd get a little more then a forced apology from the wait staff, but still no management in sight, so finally left.  I really wasn't looking for anything more then just a sincere apology and a little concern over our unfortunate incident in their restaurant.  There are many other places to eat in Tempe, so they need to treat their customers right.  NCounter, I'm very disappointed, I thought you were different then that.

I went back to NCounter today at the request of management to give them another chance after my incident last week.  I meet with Daniel and he comped me another lunch.  I got the Chop Salad and it was awesome.  It had the normal salad stuff, but also included couscous, corn, cranberries, and feta cheese.  To top it off it came with a pesto dressing that was superb.  I work on Mill and appreciate a place to eat that's consistently good and has staying power.  NCounter is my new favorite!  I highly recommend it, everything I've tried has been delicious.  If the rating was just based on food alone I would have given them 5 stars.  For me, the atmosphere makes it a 4 star rating.  It's very eclectic and modern inside and perfect for this type of restaurant, however I prefer a little less noise so it's easier to talk to my lunch companions.  Thank you to the management of NCounter for restoring my faith in their customer service.

Looking for something refreshing on a hot summer day?  Check out Paletas Betty at Mill and 5th Ave in downtown Tempe.  I got the Limon flavor, just like a slice of key lime pie on a stick, even has the graham cracker crust on one side.  It was light and refreshing and definitely satisfied that afternoon sweet tooth. They have many interesting flavor combinations. I'll be going back to try them all, after all it's going to be a long hot summer.

Stopped in here on our way out of town last week.  We've been here numerous times and even though they were good when they first opened, the last couple of times have been bad experiences.  We hesitated going back, but wanted a good breakfast before we hit the road for a 3 hour drive.  We decided to give them another try.  This time the experience was excellent.  The food was good, but the best part was Kailey our waitress, she was exceptional.  She was very friendly and very attentive.  In the past we've had poor service, so this was refreshing to see, it's restored our faith in IHOP again.  They still need to work on their service at the front counter, there were 3 of us waiting to pay our bill with no one in sight.

I love it!  Great atmosphere, excellent food and drink, and an awesome waitress, Ashley!  This was our first time, the place is huge.  Lots of seating with everything from the sitting at the bar to large hightop tables near the bar to regular sit down tables.  We went for lunch on a Saturday and were able to get right in.  Our waitress quickly greeted us and provided a couple of beer samples before we settled on my favorite, Sonoran White Chocolate Ale....yum!  The menu was fairly extensive with a wide assortment to choose from.  I decided on the California roll appetizers with a house salad.  The house salad had a lot of extras in it, not just lettuce and they have practically every salad dressing you could want.  My meal was very good.  My husband got the Reuben sandwich.  He's somewhat of a Reuben connoisseur and he professed that it was the BEST Reuben he'd ever had.  I'm going back in a couple of days for a work HH and think everyone is going to love it was well.

We have passed this place numerous times and kept saying we should try it, but we were always reluctant, now I'm sorry we waited so long.  I thought it had a good atmosphere, pub like without the high noise level.  Everyone was very friendly and the food was delicious.  They also had a great selection of beers on tap.  This will be our new lunch stop, especially when we're going to Costco, it'll add a positive to an otherwise stressful shopping trip.

I stopped by for lunch yesterday and was impressed.  It's not much from the outside but when you walk in it's very nice, clean, and good atmosphere inside.  For lunch they have a full buffet with a large selection.  I'm not an expert on Indian food, so I tried a little of everything and I loved it all.  The wait staff was very friendly and attentive.

My new favorite restaurant in Tempe!  Nice to have healthy food for a reasonable price.  I've eaten here multiple times and have never had any thing but the best.  All vegetarian and freshly made food.  The only problem is that I can never decide what to get because there's so many wonderful options.  I end up getting the 3 sides meal.  Lots of wonderful things done with lentils, kale, and awesome wraps to boot.  I've suggested a recipe book, but they inform me that everything is created from the fly and nothing is written down, great unique combinations of flavors.  Keep up the good work!

I work in downtown Tempe, Mill Ave, location and am so happy to find this place.  Finally a reasonably priced lunch that's also healthy.  With a name like Bad Mother Cluckers, I had to stop in last week just to look around and pick up a menu.  I was met by the owner and a guy behind the counter who were both so friendly and helpful, they answered all my questions and made me a copy of the menu and happy hour specials for me to take back to work.  The place has a nice outdoor patio in the front, casual seating indoors, and a lawn area in the back for outdoor games.  Yesterday I return for lunch.  The same guy was behind the counter and he recognized me from my stop in last week.  The owner delivered our food to the table and introduced herself and chatted with us for a while.  Everyone was very friendly....I really liked that about the place, it felt very welcoming.  Being on a diet and trying to eat healthy I choose the Chicken Woody, a skewer of marinated chicken grilled over a mesquite charcoal fire, and the Veggie Woody, a skewer of grilled vegetables.  They were both delicious, the chicken having a great flavor and the veggie skewer included mushrooms, onions, zuccini, and tomatos.  I added a side of the Sante Fe Corn Salad, which consisted of sweet corn, black beans and diced tomatos in a light marinade dressing, it was good as well.  My meal hit the spot, just the right about of food for the right price.  They do have larger meals and other sides to choose from.  Also, they had a yummy looking triple chocolate cake to tempt you on the front counter, but I was good and resisted tempation.  They also have beer (some bottled and one on tap) and they have wine (small one glass bottles).  They also have some great happy hour specials.  I definitely want to go back, I want to try their other Woody's (steak and shrimp).

I love this place for happy hour. Take advantage of their 1/2 price drinks and appetizers, best deal on Mill Ave. The atmosphere is great, a large patio with long tables and bench seating, plenty of room for a large group. The inside is nice too, big bar and side walls that roll up to make the inside seem like part of the outside patio.  They have a nice selection of beers and have found the wait staff to be friendly and attentive.

We ate here yesterday.  It's new to the East Valley, but come to find out they have 6 locations.  I was expecting an Italian fast food restaurant, but instead walked in to find  a very nice ambiance with a full bar, not to shabby wine menu, and loads of wonderful sounding meals.  The wait staff were all very friendly and attentive, which is high on my review check list.  They immediately serve you warm flatbread with olive oil & basalmic dip, it was a nice plus.  I had the lunch special with Mushroom & Asparagus pasta with a Mista Salad.  The salad was great, lots of ingredients with a vinaigrette dressing and the pasta had a nice flavored cream sauce.  I'd definitely order this again, except for the fact that there are some many other options on the menu that sounds delicious, I want to try them all.  My husband ordered the Meatball Sandwich with Pasta Salad.  The sandwich was served on a flatbread and the meatballs were very flavorful.  My husband thought it was delicious and would also order it again.  We had enough leftover to have for dinner that night.  The meals averaged $10, a great value for the money.  I'm so excited to have a new place in the area that has great food and gives you the option to have a glass of wine or beer with your meal.  Check it out, I don't think you'll regret it.
