Was looking for a great cup of coffee and a decent pastry this morning. Thought I would try Matador Coffee as it had good reviews listed and less than a mile from my house. I asked them what pastries they made on site and was told the scones. So I tried their strawberry scone. It was terrible. It was like eating a donut nothing like a scone. And a bad donut at that. And the coffee was nothing more than ok. I am comparing this place to my favorite coffee place called Village Coffee at the Village of Haydn. They have excellent fresh roasted coffee and great pastries. Unfortunately I don't think I will be coming back.

I was looking for something different for dinner and the "fresh grill" sign caught my attention. I absolutely love middle eastern cooking so was excited to see this place. This is a fast food restaurant however the food is cooked fresh to order. I decided to go with the gyro plate with rice and salad. In about 10 minutes, I was served this very generous plate of tons of gyro meat, tzatziki sauce, hot seasoned fluffy white rice and salad. Everything was absolutely delicious. Service was warm and friendly. I will definitely be back.

This is my 2nd visit to Cha Da in just over 24hrs! I came here for lunch and ordered the Special Pho #2 with roast pork, Chinese broccoli and thin rice noodles. I ordered the spice medium which was as hot as I could handle. The broth was so tasty and for a Thai restaurant, this was absolutely the best Pho I have ever had. It's also what drew me back once again. I am sure their other dishes are equally excellent. I will be back again very soon.

In the mood for Thai so thought I would stop in for the first time. Pretty small place and not many people inside. Bad indication for a Saturday night. I tried my favorite, Chicken with Yellow Curry. Service was pretty quick. They brought a decent sized entree with white rice. The broth of the curry although flavorful, was too watery. Curry should be thicker not soupy. The chicken seemed over cooked or just poor quality or not very fresh. It was not very tender and a bit on the dry side. Won't be coming back.
