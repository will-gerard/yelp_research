Yes, I'm thankful for having somewhere to sleep but this place is just disgusting. Room smells like a dog pissed all over the place and was told it was a "non-smoking" room only to be hit in the face by a giant cloud of nicotine and filth. Floors stained like as if drinks were spilt or something/someone pissed on it. Beddings have cigarette burns. Bathroom looks like it had never been cleaned, ever. Outside smells 10 times better than my room did.  Got into the motel late at night and was sleeping fine until some random woman starts screaming bloody murder in the middle of the night like someone was trying to kill her.   This place used to look safe from a distance but now that I've stayed here it looks shady as hell. I don't recommend this place, I would rather just spend the extra money at a Sheraton.

Thank you, so much, for ruining my Phoenix Comicon this year. NEVER AGAIN will I EVER go to this place again.  Walk in and the place is packed - much to be expected during Phoenix Comicon. Menu selection wasn't the best, but I ordered anyway because I was hungry and my boyfriend picked the place. Took a while to get our food - understandable due to Phoenix Comicon. When we get our food, DISGUSTING.   I have never, in my 23 years of life, had to salt  burger I've ordered from a restaurant. I ordered a medium burger, got something that was thrown on the grill for 10 seconds on each side. I ate it thinking it was just me being picky but it really was undercooked and gross. The Jalape√±os were the only thing keeping me eating the damn burger, and throwing salt and their salsa on it. Fries were just a hard pile of grease.  While we were trying our best to eat this stuff, I notice the wait staff hanging in their corner all at the exact same time, not tending to any tables. I let the eating food in the corner slide because I figured they had been busting their asses all day busy with convention goers, but they just stood their chattering for about 10 minutes when they could be wiping tables or clearing tables or whatever. They were just plain lazy, all except for the guy with the camo avengers shirt and the dish bucket.  Our table was so full and cluttered with useless crap that didn't need to be there. There was barely enough space for our food on the table.  They didn't ask us whether we wanted a booth or table. The regular tables were uncomfortable, YET I was in a seat that faced an empty booth that looked much more comfortable. Would've been nice to know my options.  Huge group of kids show up and they're screaming their heads off all hyper and stuff. Which I understand, BUT do you seriously have to yell, "WHO WANTS BURGERS? WHO WANTS SPAGHETTI?, Just ask the kids individually and treat them like a normal person. This isn't a damn school field trip and it was very annoying for everyone else in the restaurant, not just me.  After we tried to digest the meal we just had, I wanted to be far away from that place as possible. Get to our hotel room and, just my luck, FOOD POSIONING. So, thank you, so much, for ruining my Phoenix Comicon experience AND my Friday night. Whatever tip my boyfriend gave the waitress was NOT well deserved at all, and I don't say that often (or ever).

This is one of the places I miss about Scottsdale after moving out of the state. Great food, awesome personalities, and amazing beer. The garlic fries are to die for! Especially with the Truffle & Sriracha sauces on the side.  They do get a bit overwhelmed with the massive amounts of people. My friends had ordered some garlic fries as well and 1 person didn't get garlic on theirs and both orders where cold from sitting for a long while before being served, but we were there on a busy night so it was understandable.  if you like low-key places with outdoor seating and awesome food/beer, I highly recommend Brat Haus to any foodie or beer enthusiast.

Amazing service, amazing staff! I recommend this place to everyone who love desserts that aren't overwhelmingly sweet.   Snoh has that mix of traditional Asian sweets with an American twist which is awesome! I love the different spin they take on sweets I grew up with as a child.  Just as awesome as any iced shavery in California.
