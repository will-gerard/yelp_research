Food is great but very dissatisfied with the service.   Received an email from their reward program for a free meal when you show your reward number at the register to be told that their rewards are down and it cannot be used on this visit.   Terrible customer service and a quite shady practice to draw customers into the restaurant.

One of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant.   Took over an hour to deliver the food.  We complain about how long everything is taking so they comp some cotton candy but take even longer to take it off the bill.   Stay away if you hungry.

Absolutely recommend Rito's to anyone.    The food is great and the family owned friendly atmosphere is really what keeps us coming back.    We will keep coming back for years to come.    My personal favorite is the red chili burrito enchilada style and my wife always orders the bean burrito enchilada style.  You can't really go wrong with any choice.

Stopped in for coffee this morning and ended up staying to try the crepes.   Good food with a nice atmosphere and very pleasant staff.
