This is the best sushi restaurant in the Valley, hands-down. It's tiny, though, so get there when they open (or make reservations) for a chance at a seat. Better yet, forget this review so I can have Hiro all to myself!

As a Phoenix native, I've been eating at Durant's for ages; therefore, this rating reflects my overall dining experience versus a specific visit.  Simply put - Durant's has the best ambience of any steakhouse in the Valley, from its deep booths (perfect for date nights) and red velvet wallpaper to its kitchen entrance and Rat Pack swagger. It also has the best food on a consistent basis: I've never gone wrong with a classic martini, medium-rare prime rib, and any chilled seafood choice.   Reservations are recommended, as is eating at off-peak hours or on Sunday nights, as the bar and restaurant can get crowded / loud. But no matter when you visit, you'll see people of all ages in all levels of dressy/strange/casual/business attire - and you'll enjoy your experience. [It's much better than Mastro's or other chain-steak-places.]

Maybe it's my fault for returning to this business - my last dry cleaning service there turned all white garments dark, gray & dingey, stripped of their finish or sheen. I thought I would ask them to cold wash and press my white items this time to avoid dry cleaning damage. The girl checking me in said they would, yet when I picked up my latest order, the whites (and garments with white on them) were ruined and the man checking me out said they had not been washed, but, in fact, dry cleaned (despite my request). (The owner later explained that they HAD been washed, but with other colors and this happens / they cannot guarantee.) Yet I had to argue with the man behind the counter in front of other customers just to avoid paying for the ruined garments. Of course I won't pay for ruined garments - it will cost me hundreds to replace them. Last time I brought a $300 white jacket here, they ruined it (and I had only worn it twice.)  Bottom line: The girl who works the counter during the week is very sweet, and they mean well, but there seems to be *no way to avoid having all or partially white garments ruined, no matter the fabric, no matter if they wash or dry clean them, due to the bulk of other items all being cleaned together*. They flat out said as much.   Keep using them if you like the service but definitely clean valuable white garments at home!  Though to have to argue to avoid being charged to clean high value items that have been damaged still seems inappropriate.

FnB is one of the few restaurants in Scottsdale that blows me away each time I visit. Every starter, side, veggie dish, and entree I've had has been painstakingly prepared to perfection and manages to taste both rich and light at the same time. In Scottsdale's ocean of Fox-chain options with great furniture and meh food, FnB features actual fine-dining made from local ingredients in an atmosphere that is pleasant, yet unpretentious. If you take someone here, s/he'll be impressed.  Reservations are a must, as the place is small (and a bit closed-in feeling), and items are not inexpensive. But FnB will be one of your best meals in the Valley (on par with places such as Quiessence, Durant's, and certain items at House Brass.)

Stan is a godsend. He replies promptly to inquiries - which most handymen services do not - charges hourly and fairly, and works QUICKLY with minimal supervision. His work on various projects around my remodel has been consistently top-notch - he has even helped / guided other contractors on the property with their challenges on occasion. And when he sees things that need fixin', he fixes them immediately.    What's equally important as quick service and quality results is that *you will feel completely comfortable having Stan in your home*. In an industry unfortunately populated with unreliable contractors, sketchy (or worse) sorts, and well-meaning but bumbling 'jacks of all trades', Stan stands out as a trusted professional.

Tammy of Creative Nails is the *BEST* in the Valley when it comes to gel manis - she's quick, efficient, and excels in detail-orientation. I've been going to her for years because her gel nails are never thick or chunky; she's expert at creating both a stylish short look or a natural long look. The staff at CN work quickly enough that it's often possible to snag a same-day appointment, and they go out of their way to accommodate regulars.   What I enjoy most about the experience is chatting with Tammy. But what I respect and return for is the consistent quality of work -  the nail techs can execute a preferred style reliably each visit without much micromanagement.  Quality counts, consistency counts, and it's an added treat to receive a mani/pedi in a *quiet, relaxed* environment. with the latest US Weekly in hand. :)
