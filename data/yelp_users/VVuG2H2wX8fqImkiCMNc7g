WORST CAB SERVICE IVE EVER USED!  Jumped into a Mayflower cab from Sky Harbor. Midway through the drive, the driver turned on the meter, only to arrive at my destination to look up the milage from the airport to my house. He then proceeded to charge me off of that and not the meter, which was just shy of $60!  I will NEVER use this company again!!

Recently visited for dinner!!  Love love loved their food!  We had the snow crab, mussels, crawfish and oysters on the half shell!!  Oysters were some of the best I've had in the valley!  Great size!  The restaurant was busy when we got there so we sat at the bar, the bartender was super helpful and friendly, plus they have some great beers on tap!  Will definitely be back!

Stumbled upon this vape shop completely by accident. Couldn't have been more happy I did!  They make all their juices there and was so happy that they did!  They didn't have my favorite (guava) on their flavor menu, but made it for me right on the spot!  Staff was super friendly and helpful!  Will defiantly be back!!

For the first time in my life I'm enjoying working out, thanks to Mesa Fit Body!  I've been coming for a little over a month, and am as addicted and excited about going to the workouts than I was my first week.  The workouts are intense yet doable, the trainers are positive, supportive and push you to keep going!  My meal plan so far has helped me drop 7 pounds, and I'm in better shape now than I was in my early 20s.  Everyone who attends is super friendly too!  The workout schedules are easy and accommodating for all schedule types.  I highly recommend Mesa Fit Body, and cannot thank them enough for helping me get motivated to stay healthy and fit!
