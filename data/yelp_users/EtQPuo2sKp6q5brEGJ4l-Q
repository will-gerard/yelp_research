I always give at this location. Staff is always friendly and helpful. Convenient location. Would advise having no an appointment. They tend to be very busy in the morning.   Also will be a little chilly and they keep it a little colder for the blood.

Food was really good, staff is very friendly and the prices were good.   Small place, with nothing fancy about it.    But the food is good and not over priced, what more can you want.

My whole family has always taken all of their cars here. Always get quality work, in a timely manner without being charged extreme amounts.   Quality honest people. Would highly recommend taking your cars here for your regular service and any other car needs.

Great historic place that looks like it has never changed since it opened. In a good way.  Good was good and well priced. Service was quick. If you are in old town you should try this place. Local or tourist should check it out.

I've been to a few Gordon Biersch across different states and locations.  The one thing that stands out to be is the service for all locations.  Its good service, very accommodating.  Its a kinda place you can go with a baby and still relax but get a higher quality service, food, atmosphere and of course beer.    This location made my day, when I saw that it was directly outside my hotel.   They did not let me down.  Brought me a sample of a new beer right as I sat down without me asking.  Love that.

Great hotel for staying in vegas if your not necessarily there for the casinos.   Hotel offers free parking, Wifi and Breakfast, which is not the case for a lot of hotels/casinos.  Also since it does not have a casino in it or any gambling its more kid friendly.    I give it 5 stars due to the price and value you get for it.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  The rooms were newly renovated and clean.    Only complaints would be the shower head is low, as it is in every hotel I stay in, so can't really complain.  And the eggs at breakfast are very bland.  But also the case for hotel breakfast.  Nothing a little hot sauce can't fix.   I would stay here again.  If your not wanting the full "vegas" expereicnace and want a more quiet place to stay, that is clean and gives good amenities this is good spot.  Recommend a suite style room, as it comes with a full fridge that makes ice, microwave and stove top.  Some have ovens too.   Important note: The hotel is under a flight path for the airport.  So there is some noise there, but nothing that would wake us up.  Also with how close the airport is to the strip, most hotels will be as well.

Saying the food was amazing would fall short.  We had the spinach apple salad and the avocado pizza. I was skeptical of having avocado on my pizza, but had to try it. I was not disappointed. It was the best pizza I have ever had. As for the salad, I am not a big salad eater. Only eat salad to try and be healthy. But this salad was so good there was nothing left on my plate. Same went for the pizza.  I would strongly recommend this place. And make sure to check out the attached market.

Not my first time to Oregano's or to this location. Never had a bad experience here or any of the locations.  Staff is always very accommodating and friendly.  And whats notable is all the staff is ready to help serve you and not just your server.  Which may not seem like a big deal, but seems to be rare at other places these days.  So I feel they deserve all five stars.   Tip 1:  I would recommend the Kaboom Dip as a starter and maybe ask for extra or more bread.  Tried that for the first time last night, pretty sure I will be ordering that every time here on out.   Tip 2: Its a very popular place, so expect there to be a longer wait, and a longer time for your food to come out.  So sit back, order something cold and an starter to share and relax while you wait.    We sat out at the patio and had great service.  Ordered way to much food but loved it.  We had three young kids with us, and the service was great even through the patio was packed with large groups.  - Also somewhat rare these days.   Thank you to Makenna for the excellent service.   **Would request/Suggest they buy more high chairs.  They were all used when we were there for most of the evening.  But the staff was very accommodating and helpful with it.

I think Meh, describes it pretty well or blah.   Food was just "ok" at best.    Don't bother with the table side guacamole, it is about as bland as your can get.  Just smashed avocados with some lime and tomatoes.  We had to add a lot of salt ourselves to get any real taste.    The restaurant is in a casino, and not the most attractive place or atmosphere.   With the casino aspect it is a louder place to eat too.    Went hear for dinner, wanting Mexican food in a casual dinning level, as we were coming back from hiking.  The price and reviews seem like it would be a good spot.    But I would not be back, there are a lot of restaurants in the area, almost to many to choose from.  I would recommend you choose a different one.  If you are on vacation, then you should enjoy it, especially the food.    So Meh, i've experienced better.

If you can help it, don't use them.  Service is horrible, the product is the same.  And they are expensive.

Sadly every zips I go to seems to be the same standard.  After the first I would never go back, but keep getting pulled into them when out with groups and out voted.    Service here I would rate as poor, even for a sports bar.    The beer is not very good, yet not very cheap.   And the food is not good at all.    So yeah . . . my recommendation is go somewhere else.

Ask for Kent Webster.  He has been my family's go-to for years.  Can always trust him to do right by you.   We recently went in to get a new washer and dryer.  Mentally I was going in thinking it would be a long process, comparing prices, options and such and being a tiring process.  But that was not the case.  I think we were in the store maybe 15 minutes from start to finish.  Kent showed us the best value they had.  He did not try and sell us the most expensive ones in the store, but what we actually needed.  He was very knowledgeable about the different brands and features and why they were good or not good.    We got home still surprised how easy and painless the experience was.  I'll never go anywhere else for appliances.

Yum!  That's all I really need to say.   But yelp always wants more.   So . . . It's simple, fresh and good.   What more do you need to know  Stopping reading this'll ready  and just buy one.   It's not even that expensive.   And chances are it's really hot out right now.   So this is like a no brainier.   Like seriously why are you still reading this.

Food was allright but not sure of it was worth the price. The service was pore. Don't see any reason to ever return.

Great breakfast spot. And yes the biscuits are good.  Might have to wait a bit for a seat. But good food is worth the wait.

Great service, great team.   They do a great job.  Had them clean a house we were moving into, which had supposedly been cleaned by someone else but did not look clean.    You've got maids came in and did it right.  Appliances were all clean, the baseboards, carpet everything.   I'll use them again. No complaints.

I have come to the opinion that dutch bros only hires the happiest most friendly people around.  Any location and any time I go, everyone is always so so friendly and happy.  Like well beyond just good service, they set a whole other level for friendly.   If you are having a bad or rough day, I would suggest a trip to the Dutch Bros.  Not only is the coffee good with no shortage of caffein but the staff's happiness is contagious.   I would also suggest a trip to a dutch bros even if your not having a bad day.   Tip 1: Make sure you get a punch card.   Tip 2: If you don't know what you want, thats no problem here, they will help you out and recomend something new to try.  Don't worry they know what they are talking about.

World of Beer has to be one of my new top favorite places both for food and beer.   They have an awesome selection of beer on tap, including hard ciders and are awesome at helping pick out a new one for you.    But also their food is really really good.    Just writing this is making me hungry and wanting to go back.    Service was great, its a bar/pub atmosphere not a 5 star formal restaurant.  Its casual just the way it should be. As long as my food arrives hot and my beer cold, i'm good.

Highly recommend it. Get yourself a refreshing beverage like the woodchuck pear cider from Vermont or the Georgia iced tea. Start with the 85259 creamy burrata. Then move on to the Carolina Baby Back which are fall of the bone delicious. Then finish it off with the Chocolate Toffee Brownie and you will leave satisfied.     We tried a good portion of the menu and had no complaints. Make sure you try this place.

The pizza was just the way I like it.  Not to thin, not to thick.  It was not drowning in grease like so many other pizza places.    Recomend the white pizza.

I recomend the House team to all my clients.  And who I use for my own lending needs.   Simply put they set the bar high then set it higher.   Very knowledgeable  Very patient Very hardworking Very passionate  Very dedicated   They can take the complex and make is simple.  And they get the job done and they get it done right.

Tip 1: There are a lot of kids/families here.  Noise level was up from kids running around all over the place.   Tip 2: If you ask for a kids cup with a straw for water, make sure you specify you wanted water with that cup.  Other wise you will get a cup, a lid and straw.   The place was full by the time we left, 95% all families with lots of kids.  Noise level went up pretty quick as the kids were running around the place.  But this has nothing to do with the lower ratting.   I rated it 2 stars due to mostly service or lack there of.  My glass sat empty most of the meal.  Pizza was brought to the table without any plates.  Had to wait for the server to come back and check on us to get plates, and no other waiter or staff would help us as we tried to flag someone down.  In general I would describe the service very lethargic and distant.   Though the pizza seemed to have good ingredients on it, the toping all slide off the pizza as you pick it up.  Along with a river a grease.     I've had worse, but I have had much better.   For me, I don't plan on coming back.

Was not to impressed at all. The middle of the pizza was kinda soggy.  And multiple of the pizzas on the menu all seemed to be the same.  Don't think I'll be back.  It was a full house when I was there, so I guess other people like it.

This restaurant is at a level well above anything in Gilbert and I would go as far to say the east valley as a whole.  If you have not been here yet, go make a reservation now.  It is a little more expensive then the other options in downtown gilbert, but well worth it.   Service was excellent.  Not only very friendly but knowledgable.  Nathan knew the menu completely, he knew how each dish was prepared what was in it, and what to recommend. Not only on the food menu but beverage as well.  He also knew the history of the restaurant and the chef and anything we might ask.  He anticipated our needs and really took exceptional care of us.  So thank you Nathan and all of the Nico staff for making our night special.   Downtown Gilbert has a lot of really good food, in many different varieties and types.  So when I say Nico's food was exceptionally good, it is not to discredit the many other wonderful restaurants near by.  But the food at Nico is at a different level by far.  You can tell the care that goes into each dish, not only in how its made and cooked but the presentation as well.   Nico is a five star restaurant, one of the caliber you would expect in Scottsdale, but with a semi-casual atmosphere.  Allowing you to be well taken care of, eat exceptionally well but also feel relaxed and enjoy yourself and your company.   We will be back for sure, and are already planing our next date night here.   Thank you Chef Osso for opening this restaurant in Gilbert, and thank you to Nathan and the staff for taking such good care of us.
