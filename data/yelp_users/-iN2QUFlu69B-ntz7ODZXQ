I had a bulky desktop computer that needed to be mailed and I had no boxes. I had heard they have over the top customer service so I went to their store. They told me they would take care of it, and I felt confident that they would do it right, so I gave them my business.  I was very impressed with the photos they had put on canvas displayed in their store (you should see them!), some with beautiful special effects. We had two photos that were taken by a Vatican photographer, so they were the only copies we had of us with St. Pope John Paul II.  They did some touch ups to make the image better than the photo, and worked with me to select the right background color that framed it. We are very happy with the results! What special gifts they are that we gave to our families.  So if you need help packing something to ship, or have a precious photo you'd like to see on canvas, you can trust them to take care of your items, and do a great job.

Stopped in to place a take out order at 6 PM during the week and there were 2 other tables with guests eating food.  I placed one to-go order. I watched people come in be seated, place their order, and to my surprise and dismay, the groups of people that came even 10 minutes AFTER I placed my order got their food first. Its not that my order was a complicated dish. I flagged down the waitress that took my order and told her I had been waiting for 40 minutes and why was one take-out order taking so long? she shrugged her shoulders and said, "Its always like this." I told her I wanted to talk to the manager, and she said there wasn't one there. I asked her to check on my order, and she did and said, its almost done (it wasn't).  It took one hour and seven minutes until I got dinner!!!  I left a message for the manager to call, and I did not get a return call.  I stopped by to talk to the manager, and was told they were in a meeting. I gave it one last try and stopped by, and the manager sent the message that he was busy in the kitchen. I asked the waitress how long would he be?  She asked him and came back with the message, "When I am done."  How unfortunate that the manager does not care about customer service. I'd rather go to a restaurant with leadership that cares.

There isn't another place I would go to find knowledgable, helpful and friendly staff.  They have worked and trained in the industry for decades.  No matter the ailment, they can help recommend supplements to support the body, and which companies provide higher quality.  They won't recommend more than you need.  Their pricing is very competitive, and they have a great selection.  They host seminars to help improve health. You can sign up for their newsletter and receive coupons, as well as informative articles.   They deliver great customer service.

The owners at Funktional Fitness are so great, they donated personal training to a fund raiser, and that's how I got started.  I used to view personal training more of a splurge than getting a massage, and didn't even consider it.  I had the impression it would be expensive, but how they have structured their business is brilliant.  They have made access to personal training affordable, and their group fit workouts are a fraction of the cost of hiring a personal trainer.  I started 2 years ago, and plan on continuing indefinitely.  I drive 16 miles round trip just to work out there, it is so great.  The body changes as we grow older, and even eating the same healthy diet, with my metabolism slowing I was accumulating fat, my clothes weren't fitting.  I was not happy.   I checked out a couple of gyms, and their classes were packed, impersonal, and the stale air smelled of  sweaty bodies. At Funkfit, the classes are small, they know your name.  Now I am in the best shape I have ever been in my life.  I am a business partner of Cook Remodeling and Custom Construction, and time is precious for me.  Their team of Personal Trainers strategically plan six week cycles, one week strength, the next endurance, and every day a different format (trx, kettle bells, free weights, etc.).  I show up, get a full, intense 60 minute workout that builds muscle, burns fat, and aerobically conditions.  I don't have to think what to do, and frankly on my own I would never push myself and get such a good work out.   They have great stretches after the workout too. I feel great.  I can fit in my clothes again (saves money from having to buy bigger sizes!)  Its rare to feel so happy about a service, and I am so glad to be a member!  They are such a positive group of people who will take the time to answer questions, help, give tips.  The last time I went on a business trip, it was practically effortless putting my carryon in the overhead luggage bin on the airplane.   My husband was amazed.   I have Funktional Fitness to thank for that.  They have introductory programs for people to give it a try.  I would suggest a minimum of six months and you will really witness the benefits of the tone and energy you will gain from their workouts.
