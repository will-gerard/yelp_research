The food is always very good.  Not incredible but always very good.  I've been there 6 times now and have never had anything subpar.  I have never seen a spec of dirt.  I have never gotten a wrong order.    The thing that makes The Blue Fin incredible is the service.  I have never seen a group of people who take more pride in serving their customers.  They are some of the kindest people you could possible meet.  How many times do you hear an owner ask if you want more food on your plate while you are staring at a huge mound of meat and rice?  Not said to try and get you to buy more food but because tell she was worried there wasn't enough chicken there.    The portions are hefty for the price, the food is always good, It comes out from the kitchen fast, and the service is incredible.  Definitely make a stop the next time you are in the area.

What's a matador?  Nothing fella I just don't want to open up because the food behind me is horrible.  Seriously the food is really bad.  We live in AZ.  How can a Mexican restaurant get Mexican food so wrong?  Should my beans be orange?  I got the chilli verde burrito enchilada style and the beef was a disgusting color of salmon and didn't taste any better than it looked.  Service was great.  I was served promptly and and my food came out quickly.  That is the only reason for the two stars.

I got there about 4:30 on a week day which happens to be about an half an hour before they open.  decided to just stick around and wait for them to open.  The owner drives up and tells me it's too cold to be waiting outside and that I should come on in even though they aren't open yet.  Good start.    You walk in and it feels like a real sushi bar.  No leather lined walls.  No fire and ice fireplace.  No hostess in a geisha outfit.  Just lots of wood and cheap chairs.  You know, like a sushi bar should be.  The place looks and smells clean.  Ok, so far we are doing well.  So i grab some hot sake on a cold rainy day and starting to instantly feel at home.  I tell the sushi chef to just bring whatever he recommends.  some low points and some high points.  Then he brings me the white tuna.  Oh my god!!!!  This is the best thing ever.  Soft, buttery, tons of flavor.  At this point I couldn't be happier.  Everything I ordered at this point was tasty and fresh.  The only downside was the rice....Not bad but not great.  The octopus however, was really good.  If it is not cut right it can be very rubbery.  This however, was not.    I will definitely be back.  The service was absolutely fantastic.

Been there a couple of times, but usually just for takeout as there is nothing better than laying in bed, eating Chinese, and watching a movie.  I was never totally impressed but it's the closest Chinese restaurant to my house and so I went back.    Then one magical day I decided to dine in.  It was a momentous day indeed.  It was the day I discovered the trick to China Chili.  You see you need to go in.  Sit down.  Order way more than you are going to eat.  Munch a bit at the table.  Then get the rest wrapped up.  For some reason if you call in a to go order the food is not nearly as good.    Favorites you ask?  Well, thanks for asking.  All time favorite is the pillow chicken.  It tastes just like foil chicken but is much larger with out the hassle of all the foil.  Next favorite?  Anything with scallops.  Seriously the cooks in the back must have a PhD in scallopology.  They are consistently cooked to perfection.    Last but not least is the egg foo young.  It's not on the menu but ask and ye shall receive.    The only reason this place doesn't get a fifth star from me is the take-out.  Food is delicious and service is ridiculously good.  I wish I didn't have to play the games I do but will continue to do so to ensure great take-out.

"You know the problem with young women?  They're too much work!"  -Cowboy  This guy was my hero.  I have never seen a man so happy.  He walked around in his boots, jeans, teal cowboy shirt, and cowboy hat.  This man has figured out was life is about and is quick to show you.  He dances around spinnin' his hat, playin' pool, and wooin' the ladies.  He gives his pearls of wisdom to those that will listen, and leaves the rest alone.    Bartender was fantastic, friendly, and poured a mean Guiness.    The karaokestador (there may be another name for someone who leads karaoke but I can't think of one) was great.  I almost got us all kicked out by droppin the mic after a song but she quickly realized this group was way too much fun for that.  As the night went on she warmed up to us and struggled to let us leave at closing time.    We sang, we laughed, we drank, and we had a great time.  I live fairly close to this place and will likely be back.

The Food? Only if you have to.  The Bathroom?  Only if you have to.    So why the five stars?  Because it does what it's supposed to extremely well.  The second I walk in I hear "hey Dante" from the bartender as he pours me a Guinness.  Can you say that about a bar in town?  I can sit with friends on the patio and people watch.  You'll likely hear Bob Barker or see Cliff.  You'll notice the alley or like to call it "narnia" for the fact that no one who walks down it ever walks out as the same person.  You can sit on the patio of Seamus and judge the people at Ghost Lounge.  You see life walking around and can do it with a cigarette in one hand and beer in the other.

For some reason I had missed out on the rusty trombone...errrr...spur while I lived in old town.  What a shame.  I went last night for the first time and wished that it was in midtown so I could drink there regularly.  Salty bartender who sings from behind the bar and sassy guitarist/singer up on the stage were both great.  The pour was strong and reasonably priced.  I think if I got too drunk I would be pretty tempted to start pulling dollars off the wall and tipping with them.  The place is pretty small though but It kind of lends itself to making new friends and getting a loud and rowdy.

Completely over rated.  I've been there about 7 or 8 times and never had a fantastic burger.  It's not bad.......it's just not great.  Maybe it's because my childhood was never a memorial day BBQ kind of childhood, that I think thin burgers are pretty meh.  They just never have that juicy medium rare middle that I long for.  Lines are too long during peak hours and you wind up waiting just as long on off peak hours.  It's hot.  The chairs suck.  The fact that the bathrooms are outside for some reason grosses me out.    It's not that I will never eat there.  I just won't go out of my way to eat there.

Two trips to Fez and I am completely comfortable giving it a 5 star review.  The pour is heavy.  The food is delicious.  The service is great.  They let me smoke on the patio and have a drink in my hand at the same time.  I won't go into detail since it's all been said before but definitely try the chicken philo appetizer.

Yeah...........What everyone else said.........Food is great.  Restaurant is small.  Line is long.  Service is great.    If they delivered this would be the world's best breakfast place.  Even if they had take out.  But delivery?  That would be fantastic.  I could totally picture myself hung over eating a hog and chick in bed.

I tend to romanticize Mexico.  It's a little strange I know, but I always feel that Mexico is one huge hacienda style restaurant on the beach just perfect for day drinking.  This is what El Encanto is to me.  What my preconceived notion of what Mexico should be like.  That may make me a backwards American hill billy but so be it.     I enjoy El Encanto.  I do not get to make it up there as often as I would like since It is about 5 miles past ridiculously far, but when i am there I am always glad I went.  This is usually the place I take out of town guests from the East Coast or Midwest.    The food is good.  I usually get the Queso Guillermo (How does my dictionary recognize Guillermo but not Queso?  That's gotta be fixed.)  It is basically boiling cheese with a few spices and some green onion.  You can add shallots and this beef that appears to be shredded beef that has either been dried or fried, and I strongly recommend that you do.  I have had the lamb, which is ridiculously good, the fish tacos, which are not deep fried as most other places are, and the pork, which is pork and I love pork.  I have yet to have anything there that was not delicious.    My main problem with El Encanto happens to be their Margaritas.  You would expect that a great day drinking mexican spot would have great Margaritas right?  Wrong.  Too sweet, pre-made margarita mix.  This is easily remedied by ordering a shot of Don Julio and a Negra Modelo!  All in all definitely worth going to if you are in the area.  Make sure to laugh when your guest asks the waiter if they have fresh duck or turtle soup on the menu.  They will think they are wildly original and witty.

On Saturday I want to punch people in the face when here.  Mediocre food, overhyped, overpriced, no parking, bad service, and waaaaaaaaay too many people to enjoy yourself. Once upon a time you may have been worth it but with so many solid offerings in Phoenix these days your entitled attitude is not warranted.  No it's cool, I'll clear off the table that you just walked by four times with nothing in your hands.  What's that?  Oh I shouldn't do that?  I should just stand here and look at the table full of dishes until you walk by a 6th time?  Ok.  Hey, one more thing. Kiss my ass.

I would absolutely give my server 5 stars.  That's why this review is so hard to write.  She was attentive, kind, and an all around sweet heart.   The food however was bland and boring.  I have never seen a chop house/seafood restaurant with so little seafood in my life.  I ordered the king crab artichoke open faced sandwich.  I had really high hopes for the sandwich since it had all of my favorite ingredients.   Cheese? Check  Crab? Check Artichoke? Check Sourdough? Check  It takes great skill to take all of these ingredients and throw them together in such a way that I really have a hard time describing just how uneventful the sandwich was.    The rest of the menu looked even less intriguing than this sandwich.    Decided to have some Creme Brulee.  I am a huge fan of this dessert but was so let down again.  The consistency was there but they do not use real vanilla (just extract) so there is not a ton of flavor.  I also tasted the grainy texture of the sugar that had not completely caramelized.  Pretty difficult to make a Creme Brulee taste boring.    Good job Kincaid's.  You've managed to accomplish what only a T.G.I. Fridays could.

Sometimes I just want a little shame.  I want to look at my meal and say to myself "seriously? You think that's a good idea?" That's usually the time that I dive into something like Lenny's.   It's definitely not a health food spot.  I usually get the Mexican Burger which has green chile and lots ooey gooey goodness on it.  The fries are always delicious and I firmly believe that they are sprinkled with crack.    The hours kind of suck, the AC doesn't seem to work that well, and the ordering/seating is a bit of a cluster *&^# but it just can't be beat for a hangover burger.

A little disclaimer before I start.  I used to work with one of the owners of this company before.  I worked at a furniture store in Scottsdale for a while and we recommended them to customers who wanted to get rid of the furniture they had.  We never received one complain about them and often I heard from customers how great they were.    As to Matt (one of the owners) I can say he is by far one of the most honest individuals that I have ever met.  I have nothing but great things to say about him and I am sure that most people who have dealt with him feel the same way.

Loved this place......I just went in today for the first time to check everything out and about half way through my tour the owner informs me they just announced they are closing their doors.  I picked up a few little things since everything is half off.  How sad.  I hate to see cool local businesses go out.  I wish I had found them earlier so I could have maybe bought a bit more in order to help.

Fantastic place.  I have been going every other week for about 8 months now.  I have strayed a couple of times, going to more expensive barber shops thinking that I would have a magical haircut that would completely change my hair ( I have a ton of damn cowlicks) but I always come back.  $16 for students, $18 for just a regular cut.  I do wish that their straight razor shaves were a bit less money but it's usually a luxury I indulge in only on occasion.  I always feel welcome and truly enjoy getting my haircut here.  At the time of posting there were 7 out of 7 5 star reviews.  well this makes 8 of 8.  great job Downtown Barbershop.  That's a track record I think any business owner can be proud of.

Oh Switch.  I want to give you 5 stars.  I really do.  You're close, your food is fairly good, your drinks are hefty, and your 2 dollar bloodies are quickly becoming a weekly excursion for me.  Your service on the other hand......So hit or miss.  There is one server there who is always great.  Usually by the time I am seated she brings me my Makers on the rocks.    Who doesn't love that?  Other times however, I get other servers.  Usually they are a bit confused and looking lost.    Drinks are strong food is fair and I live close.  4 stars it is.

Sushi Brokers is the Ra of sushi bars.  (See what I did there?)  I have been only once and was so disappointed I couldn't drag myself back.  It's one of those sushi bars that make up for a lack of quality product by masking everything with cheesy names on a menu filled with "creative" rolls.  Calling these concoctions sushi is like calling the new Burger King Ribs BBQ.  It's always packed when I pass it.  Which makes me like it even less.  This is not a place for sushi lovers but a place to appear to be a sushi lover.

$20 for a double Maker's Mark?  Me thinks not T.G.I. McPappadeaux.  I was not impressed by anything that was there and will not only steer clear but may avoid the I-17 all together.

Thou shalt not covet thy neighbors server.    I was so guilty of this.  As I sat there looking for my server I watched the super server who had what seemed like the entire restaurant as her station.  It seemed like every employee in the restaurant checked on me.  except my server.  If I waited for her to bring me some more iced tea I would still be looking.  No silerware.  No smile. No "how is your burger".  No "thanks for coming in"    I felt like she was an ex-girlfriend I ran into at some bar somewhere.  No eye contact, minimal conversation, every thing was just really tense.     Food was a little disappointing.  The bun was soggy and the paddy just fell apart.  The presentation looked like it was a tossed hamburger.  Everything just kind of landed on the plate.  On the plus side the ice was cold and I got billed the correct amount.  (eventually)  Don't think I will be back.

I usually wouldn't give a review for delivery but I had such a good experience that I felt it was warranted.    A couple of weeks back I ordered a pizza from Mamma Mia's.  I was told what the amount would be before I hung up and so I got my cash together before it came.  The driver gets there almost an hour later, (I usually plan for this by ordering well in advance) and I pay the driver.  I get inside and rip the box open as I hear a knock on the door.  It's the driver again.  He hands me a $20 and says I think you gave me too much.  I had planned on giving him a $5 bucks for a tip.  I was absolutely impressed by this.  I could not imagine such honesty from a delivery driver.  I think most would have taken the money and ran.  I gave him double the tip that I had originally intended to, ran inside, and called the owner to tell him how great the driver was.  I will always tip this guy well in the future and applaud his honesty.  To the food.  Great pizza.  Not your gourmet type pizza but a good New York style pizza with a lot of cheese, great sausage, and great dough.

I  am downgrading due to the website ordering system.  I am a bit annoyed by the fact that there seems to be a fee for using the online ordering.  So when you email me that you are giving me a coupon but can only use it on your online ordering then you aren't really giving me the amount that you say you are.  I actually tried to call and was told I could only use the coupon online and it would not be accepted otherwise.  between your fees and taxes I am paying nearly 33%of the food total to have a pizza delivered if I do it online.  This annoys the hell out of me and I don't know why it bugs me as much as it does but I think I am done ordering here for a while.  It's a shame because I really like your pizza.

This review is strictly for wine, atmosphere and service.    I didn't eat here but I really like the place.  It's got a great laid back feel to it with out being a sloppy dive bar.  Well designed and original decor.  The wine was great as were the suggestions from the bartender (I'm not a huge wine drinker but I was trying to behave myself)  The patio seems like a great day drinking spot.  I will definitely be back for dinner and to solidify this review.

I have used Camelback Moving twice now and each time has been great.  Not one thing has broken.  Estimates have always been fairly close.  The movers were very professional and moved quickly.    I will absolutely use Camelback Moving in the future.

Z Pizza you are nothing special.  Rubbery salty crust.  Your whole pizza is merely so so and your slices border on abysmal.  Staff didn't seem to care if I was there or not.  The owner was there and that was more important than my late lunch order.  Ok you're organic.  Guess what?  I don't care.  When I want pizza I don't want to feel like I am making a healthy compromise.  I only want something tasty and unhealthy.  That's why I'm eating pizza instead of a salad.    Ok you have gluten free options.  The only thing sadder than that is a fat kid with no money staring at a bakery counter.    I don't buy your hype.  Your food is so so at best.  I will continue to order elsewhere.

I've always found the key to a sushi experience is to put yourself completely in the hands of the chef.  I did this with Tai Mai Shu (this is how he introduced himself, he gave another name later but can't remember it now) and was completely satisfied.    First off this is aesthetically one of the best restaurants in town.  I was absolutely impressed.  To those of you who think the chairs look like shopping carts perhaps you should tell that to MoMA who has the Bertoia Chair ( these are a reproduction of the original) on permanent display.    The food was fantastic and reasonably priced.  Tai Mai Shu told me that there is a happy hour as well as reverse happy hour that I will be sure to check out soon. Everything that I had was delicious and a simple twist on a traditional sushi.  Thanks Tai Mai Shu!  Tai Mai Shu!  Sorry had to say it one more time.

I still haven't picked how many stars I am going to give Gallo Blanco.  On one hand I was there at that magical time of the day where servers are in I just don't give a damn mode.  (Four o'clock for those of you who have never waited tables.)  This is the time when servers are either getting off work and just want to get home or just started and haven't really gotten in their groove yet.   I got to the restaurant about 15 minutes before my other, party and the hostess seemed absolutely amazed and flabbergasted (wow that one went down with out spell check) that I  was meeting another someone.  After the confusion of seating I sit down and am ready for a little happy hour goodness.  I order a margarita which my waitress informs me is made with fresh juices.  I am pretty excited.  I love me a tasty margarita and have read good things.  Margarita comes. Huge disappointment.  Way too sweet.  Not enough citrus to this little fella.  And definitely not enough tequila.  My friend comes and I decide that I am going to switch to something else.  A sangria seems to be in order.  Now usually I drink sangria when I want to maintain.  This must have been a magical sangria because i actually got a pretty hefty buzz from the little fella.  After a few of these we decide it's time for some food.  She has the vegetable tacos, on recommendation from the waitress, that she seemed to enjoy.  (The whole idea of vegetable tacos is absolutely beyond my comprehension)  I also asked for the server which she would prefer as far as tortas.  The pork or the beef.  At this point I came to realization that I was probably asking a vegetarian which she would prefer.  Oops.  I went with the pork which was absolutely delicious.  I was a little disappointed that there were no sides with it though.  I would have ordered some if I knew it didn't come with any.    About half way through the meal I notice the server doing side work and told her if she needed to close out my check I would be more than happy to do so, so that she could get going.  She did and out came the new server.  The happiest guy I have ever come across.  And he looked just like John Lequizamo's more full brother.  (Photo to be attached).    Sat at the table for a while longer and then Flamenco started.  Flamenco was absolutely incredible as always and  I was really excited that they had moved it inside as it was way too hot to sit on a roof top.  I offered to close out my tab with the waiter so we could move to the bar and he offered to continue bringing us our drinks.  Fantastic!  This guy really was the happiest person I had met in a while.    Prices were good, food was good, atmosphere was good , service was good minus a few missteps, and the sangria was good.  All in all I will definitely be back but can't give 5 stars.  I think 4 is a pretty reasonable for Gallo Blanco but I can foresee a 5 star update in the future.  The End ( I feel like that was a novel)

The Mai Tai here is ridiculously good.  I'm not generally a foo foo drink kind of guy but at hula's I make an exception.  For some reason being a girly drink alchoholic is totally acceptable to me here.  If they had a glass covered in glitter and had sparklers sticking out of it I would order it from here.  They are that good.    The food can be a bit hit or miss.  The Calamari is good.  Not what I expected but tasty.    Definitely a favorite come winter time for day drinking on the patio.  Or night time drinking for that matter.  Great decor.  Great firepit.  Love the open restaurant feel with the garage doors open.    I would give 3 stars for food and 5 for everything else.  Weighted, Hula's comes to a solid 4 stars.

Went back to Hula's for a little pre-bday brunch with some family.  6 of us left trashed and full of delicious food for less than 150 bucks.  I'm not talking about lightweights either. We had a pretty serious collection of empty glasses goin on.  The pork hash was delicious.  Eggs came out a little less runny than I would like and they rushed back to grab me some new ones without making me feel like a d-bag.  Hula's is quickly becoming a regular spot for me.

The staff here is absolutely incredible.  I came in looking for some fresh mozzarella and a few other ingredients for dinner that night.  They didn't have any mozzarella left but they had buratta that they were thinking about carrying.  I was promptly given a full container for free to take with me with the caveat that I have to let them know whether or not I think they should stock it.  A resounding yes btw.  I then started talking to someone about tomatoes and I trun around and there is a small tomato quartered and sitting on a plate being handed to me to try.  Seriously?  I felt like If I spent enough time there I would be given enough samples to make a whole meal.  But it worked because everything that I sampled I would purchase in a heartbeat there.  I love the fact that everything is locally sourced and I love the passion of the people that work there.  If I could get the prices down it would be a more frequent spot for me but quality isn't cheap so I understand.  Thanks Public Market.

This is not a review but a love letter.  There are so many reasons to love centurion I have a hard time knowing where to start, so I guess I will just start at the beginning.  THEY HAVE A LIQUOR LICENSE AND WINE SELECTION WITH A SELECTION OF BEERS AND LIQUORS COMING SOON.  We walk up to a small restaurant within walking distance of the Central and Roosevelt Lightrail stop.  There are about 4 or 5 tables on the patio and about 10 tables inside with the tiniest open kitchen you have ever seen.  Seriously, the guy has 4 burners and a brick oven.  Not a whole lot to work with if you're a chef in my opinion.  The restaurant has a good neighborhood kind of feel.  It's not a kitschy overly modern place. Now I'll get to the best part of the restaurant, the food.   We started with a Baked Brie with raspberry jam in a phylo pastry.  It was insanely inexpensive as an app that two could share for 7 bucks and the grapes that came with it were seriously some of the tastiest grapes I've ever had.  The Brie was had a nice strong flavor and was extremely tasty.    Next I had the Taglioni with pulled duck, artichoke hearts, and leeks in garlic cream sauce.  The price for entrée was 14 bucks and was an insane for the amount and quality food you get.   The flavors were incredible and here is my one wish for the meal.  I would have loved a nice thick noodle to hold up to the sauce a bit better.  The Taglioni is tasty and does well but I think something like a Pappardelle would have held up a bit better texturally.  The duck was cooked extremely well and was insanely tasty and the sauce was ridiculously good.  When I say ridiculously good, I mean ridiculously good.  I could sit with large bowls of that sauce and some bread and sop it up for a day and a half.  When our server Sean checked up on us I mentioned how I loved him for bringing me some crispy dusk skin with the meal and he comes back with even more.  This is about the point I fell in love with this restaurant.  Tiffany B had the Salami and Artichoke Pizza and I cannot describe how tasty it was.  This is my new pizza place hands down.  Forget Cibo, forget Pizzeria Bianco, go to Centurion for pizza.  They make pizza exactly like I like it.  The dough was delicious, not too salty like most doughs, and was airy and fluffy.  The sauce was sweet without being too sweet and all around flavorful.  It is extremely reasonably priced at 13 bucks for the pizza which makes me love the place even more.    At this point we are late for our movie and are so in love with this place that a second bottle of wine and some dessert are in order.  The chef Eric Osbourn comes out and talks to us for a while and lets us know a bit about himself and the restaurant.  His goal is to bring gourmet foods in at an affordable price.  You can tell in talking to him that he serves things that he personally loves and that he loves food.  You don't get the feeling of a menu put together to maximize profit or to impress but to be as tasty as possible.  He is C.I.A. trained primarily as a pastry chef.  Ok seriously?  The rest of the food was so good and his specialty is desserts?  Sign me up.  After we talk to him for a while I tell him bring out whichever desserts we should have and a second bottle of wine.  He selects a sparkling wine for us and tells us he will be bringing out a trio of desserts for us to try.    The first is a freshly baked Marscapone and Strawberry Phylo Pastry with Chocolate and Chili "Soup".  I am not a fan of chocolate but when the pastry was gone and there was chocolate left I started looking around the table for more things to dip in it.  The chilies were not overpowering at all but left a nice hint of spice.  Next we had a lemon sorbet, and a quince grenata with a raspberry puree, and a blueberry puree.  Both were good but the quince grenata with the blueberry puree was delicious beyond words.  Finally we had a chocolate flourless torte with, crème fresh, raspberry puree, and candied wine soaked quince.  The candied quince were sooo good.  I could eat a bowl of them with some crème fresh and be happy but add the chocolate torte and I was even happier.    The entire meal (appetizer, pasta, pizza, 3 full desserts, and 2 bottles of wine) came in at a hundred bucks.  I got fast attentive service, from both Sean, who was an incredibly knowledgeable server, and Eric Osbourn, who is a fantastic chef.  I cannot recommend this place highly enough.   This will absolutely be a regular haunt for me as it is by far the best restaurant value I have found in Phoenix.  The restaurant is open til 2 on the weekends which will also make this a late night post boozin it up spot.

I am extremely picky about my creme brulee.  I make my own and go all out when I do.  I'm talking buyin vanilla beans.  Fresh eggs.  The whole 9.  Torched Goodness is FANTASTIC.  I had the cappuccino on the recommendation of owner and couldn't have been happier.  What a welcome addition to the Phoenix food scene.

I am a HUGE fan.  Partially because this was the most filling hotdog I have ever had.    I 100percent put my taste buds in the hands of the owners and just said give me whatever I should have.  They brought me out two halves prepared in two different styles,  One had beans and was delicious (the Miko I think)  and the other was spicy (the Aiko I think).  I was absolutely in love with both.  They apparently will be at Shady's every Thursday night and Public Market more often.  From now on every time I see them I'm stopping.    YUM!

Seriously some of the best ribs I have ever had.  Coming from a husky gentleman such as myself that says a lot.  The ribs had obviously been very slowly cooked and literally fell off the bone.  That's right, literally.........not figuratively, literally.  The beans were tasty and the coleslaw  was too.  But the ribs were ridiculous.  Not the cheapest ribs I have ever had but definitely reasonable.  The owner seemed jovial and a slight bit nerdy but well intentioned as can be.   If I were staying in town this would be a regular haunt.

There's BOOZE!!!!!  Yeah I know this may seem a little simple minded but THERE'S BOOZE.!!!!!    I moved to the area about 7 months ago and since that point I have been stockin' up extra for just in case I run out and can't drive to the store.  Now I only have to worry about public intoxication instead of a D.U.I.  Thank you CVS for helping me to become a more functioning alcoholic.  P.S.  The single serve liquor is by the register next to the street entrance.

I went to Lucky Strike on Saturday Night.  This review is more about the feeling I got than any particular aspect or event there.  With one exception, my bartender was absolutely my favorite bartender of all time.  (If you are reading this you make the best iced tea ever!)    We get there about 7:30 and had to wait about half an hour for a lane.  No problem, it's Saturday at 7:30 on opening weekend.  I kind of expected a longer wait.  We all sit down at the bar, order some drinks, and grab a bite to eat.  I had a club sandwich (not so great), friends had a pizza (they seemed to like it), and the last of our foursome had the pretzels sticks (I stole one and loved it).  The drinks were good and seemed well mixed.  I generally just drink bourbon on the rocks, so it doesn't take a genius,  but the pour VERY generous.    When our TGI McManahan's beeper goes off we head on over to the front desk to claim our lane.  It wound up being about 20 per person for shoes and and the lane.  By the way.  Try not to go anywhere you need to rent shoes with a guy well over 6 feet...Size 14? really?  There were some issues with my friends changing over the bar tab but these things happen with an opening weekend.  The music had some high points but over all was a little disappointing.  The waitresses were attentive.  I bowled like crap.  That about sums up the facts.  Oh wait.  The place is done very well as far as decor.    I will definitely be back but I don't see myself making it a weekly trip.  Maybe every other month.

This review is mainly for the bar and a few light (ok not light, but small) snacks.    Met with a couple people during their soft opening and there was absolutely nothing soft about it.  I got there a few minutes early and posted up at the bar to grab a Manhattan.  This drink is usually my boozometer when I am trying a place first.  Ok, we've got something here, this drink is tasty.  Started talking to the bartenders and got a really comfortable feeling from them.  When was the last time that you sit down to the bar and  they ask your name, tell you their's, and then shake your hand?    After the manhattan the rest of the group showed.  The bar was a little too busy to fit the three of us so I took my second drink, sazerac, to the table.  Sazerac was tasty as well.  Rest of the table ordered some drinks and nothing negative to be said anywhere.  We each had around 4 or 5 drinks and every last one of them was delicious.    We were comped a few bar snack and all were delicious but the stand out was the warm nuts. (twss)  Mixed nuts warmed with Herbs De Provence and a little bit of chili flake I believe.  Soooooo good.    As for the style of the place it is fantastic.  Feels cool but not cliche.  The Palomar staff did a fantastic job of designing this space.  As of now this is the one place in City Scape that is worth while.

I've now been here 4 or 5 times and every time Lustre has exceeded my expectations.  Great drinks, nice patio that reminds you that you're in a real city, and fantastic service.

Been twice and really enjoyed both visits.  The drunken noodles are tasty and flavorful without being overly spicy.

I've been going to assorted downtown barbershops for a few years and forgot what a good haircut looks like.  The second I got  home my girlfriend told me that I wasn't  allowed to go back to a traditional barbershop.  Thanks Brit.

You're all doing it wrong.    While I like their pizza I have equally good pizza right next to my house in Cibo.  Their Calzone however...That's what you should be ordering.  They fry their calzone as opposed to baking it.  It winds up like an italian fry bread filled with sausage and cheese and olives.  It's like going to a fair in Italy.    I worry about Locale.  In a sea of fantastic pizza that is Downtown Phoenix it's equally good but for some reason gets none of the love as the surrounding pizza spots.

Don't go here.  I repeat do not go.  This is the best BBQ in AZ and I want you to stay away.  Seriously.  If you go messing up my secret BBQ spot I'm gonna be seriously mad.  If you do go, do not try the brisket, the pork ribs, the beef ribs, the sausage, the turkey, or the pulled pork.  Just have like pickles and bread or something.  If you do you're gonna come back and mess up my secret BBQ spot in AZ.  Also don't talk to the owners.  They're really nice people and you'll like them and want to promote their business because it's ridiculous BBQ run by ridiculously nice people.  Then you'll tell all of your friends and they'll ruin my secret BBQ spot in AZ.    So what I'm really saying is I already hate you all for making me wait in line for hours a few months down the road once you don't listen to me and ruin my secret BBQ spot in AZ.

So today was my second time at Bitter and Twisted.  The first being an early soft opening and the second being their grand opening.  On the soft opening I went to I had a wait.  A considerable wait.  That's ok.  I understand that a restaurant uses soft openings to refine their systems and work out the kinks.  I know that my drinks will be discounted, my food will be comped, and the reason for this is that the restaurant or bar is using me as guinea pig.  These are the trade offs that come with soft openings.  They are not to get you in the door and try their stuff for free or discounted rates.  They are to refine their service.  With this said I expect good service and quality product on opening night when you have had multiple soft openings.  Luckily Bitter and Twisted delivered on their opening night.    Every drink I've had here has been strong, delicious, inventive, and delicious.  Also the drinks have been delicious and inventive and delicious and strong.  I've yet to try something there that isn't one of the tastiest drinks I've had in Phoenix.  It makes me a bit sad to see a few negative reviews dampen the beauty and creativity that has gone into this bar.  I hope the rest can see past a few people who don't understand what a soft opening is and see what the rest of phoenix already gets.  Bitter and Twisted is a next step in Downtown Phoenix as well as Arizona.
