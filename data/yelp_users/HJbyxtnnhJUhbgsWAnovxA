Awesome service at great prices.  Not to mention beer selection is outstanding!  Waiter was great in recommending paired beers to our meals obviously knew what he was talking about!  Especially great for Sunday lazy afternoons!  They even change the sport channel to your preference!

I wouldn't take Fluffy or Bubba anywhere else!  We've been going to this clinic for 12 years!!  This operation of top notch doctors and staff is one professional and class act business!  They are simply the best!

Half price happy hour is what caught my eye, since I have teenagers that eat a ton!  In and out is easy so long as you go before 5:30, otherwise there is a bit of a wait.  Food quality good and love all of the shrimp dishes!

Whenever I have have an issue with Verizon and have to think about going to this store to straighten out phone issues, anxiety strikes!  The absolute worst customer service I've ever encountered and always have to return numerous times to fix the same problem.  It's very sad that Verizon hasn't taken a second look at this store's poor performance and customer service record and step things up.  Who is the CEO of this company and why don't they care? Wait time?  At least an hour, plus it seems they take comfort in telling their customers this!  I would not be in business or friends if I treated people like this!  What gives???

I always feel like I "Fit-in" at DeLaFit!  I have been taking some personal training classes with the owner and she is fabulous!  She always has safety and my best interests in mind.  I feel great and energized when I leave. LOVE this place!

The service department is top notch!  Tyler, helped me a few weeks ago after I had been in an accident and he went above and beyond explaining in detail to me what to expect and pricing.  I will continue to go back to this particular Volvo service department despite distance from my home.

Love this place!  Great prices, great for kids and very filling and delicious!  My only suggestion would be to expand their beer selection, but it's a great place to dine in and take out!  Very reasonably priced as well!
