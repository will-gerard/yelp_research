Today was the last straw. I'm never coming here for a car wash again.  First of all, half the staff act a whole lot like they have better things to do than work at a car wash. Most of them are standing around, chit chatting and not doing anything to help customers. Today I decided to drive up to the pumps near the car wash center instead of the ones at the actual gas station. I thought I would save time and would have to make less stops. WRONG. I drove up to a pump turn off my car and was about to fill up my tank, and then the man standing over this podium looks at me like he doesn't understand what I'm doing there. He tells me "this one is broken, go over there." Wow. Talk about manners. So why exactly is he standing there again? And why isn't the pump marked 'out of order'? I back out and pull up to a different pump. This next man was nicer, except he was so clueless. There wasn't a place to insert my card so I asked him if I can even pay right here, he says he doesn't know. But he doesn't think I can, and he doesn't know why. What? Lol.. But after he fills my tank he tells me to go all the way around and pay for both inside. Then come back to get my car washed. Which ultimately defeats the entire purpose of convenience. So I drive around to the front and after getting out of my car, I find that he didn't even put the cap back on and close it. Smh. Then when I'm inside paying I find out that what he should have told me is to leave my car there and walk in to pay, while a staff member DRIVES my car through the wash for me. So I complain to the cashier about how inconvenient this all is. She probably went out and told the guys outside because the second time coming around I pull up and I guess the manager? Comes out to tell me he's so sorry for the confusion and he "upgrades" my car wash. I thought that was cool but I'm still annoyed at how much of my time is being wasted. I don't understand what was so upgrading about my car wash though lol because my car was still dirty. Or was that because the man drying my car did a half ass job considering he spent such little time on it.   Overall it was the worst but I'll throw in a pity star since I did get an apology from 1/5 people who made this a bad experience.

WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!   We got seated right away but no one came to take our drink order, we had to wave down a man who was not happy to do it, then we asked a lady who works there for sate chili oil and she responded "ask someone else"! Not like I even have high expectations for Asian restaurants but this was REALLY bad. Also, the restaurant was full but there were only 2 ladies pushing the carts of dim sum around. No one ever came back a second round and all the customers around us were getting just as mad. The food isn't even that good. I would rather go to Phoenix palace!

The sushi here is pretty good, I enjoyed the FWB roll. And the squid salad was yum. The teppanyaki however is soooo salty and oily! I don't know if my chef accidentally over salted the fried rice or what but it was pretty bad. His performance wasn't that great or interesting either. He also forgot one of our orders until the very end. So we told him not to make it since most of us were done. The deco here is nice and I didn't mind the upbeat music. Definitely not a place for family/kids. It gets loud. First and will be the only experience, I'm going back to Benihana!

Oh man, why haven't I tried this place any sooner?! The rolls here are as good as my favorite places in Cali. The sauces weren't too overpowering, there was just enough rice,  the sashimi was thick and fresh *melt in your mouth* quality. I would say the price is about average or slightly higher than other places, but for the quality and creativity of the food, I think it's so worth it. We ordered 6 rolls that came out to about $80 (not including tips). The chef was a chill guy and our waitress was very attentive. Also like the vibe here because they play a lot of edm. Good music, good food, good service. I will definitely be coming back!

Pretty comparable to California's thai food restaurants. The yum nua was good and I liked the drunken noodle. The pad thai was too drenched in sauce/seasoning.. The sour smell was too strong. Not getting that again.

Tomato gin soup is a must. Caprese salad was good, but nothing spectacular. Grilled artichoke? Skip it. You can literally make it at home. Cut 1 artichoke in half, throw on grill and brush with olive oil, then dash with Parmesan cheese. Too basic to be $12 but I tried it for the reviews. Also unimpressed by how long I had to wait for my food. I don't think I'll be back.

I always come here! They have prime service and the drinks are much tastier than before. I like taro coconut milk tea with pudding, almond milk tea with lychee jelly, and passion green tea with assorted jelly. Calamari rings and popcorn chicken are delish!

By far the worst calamari I have ever had. Spinach artichoke dip tasted gross. Appetizer sampler was not worth it. Only thing that tasted alright was the coconut shrimp. For entree I had orange peel chicken and that was okay. To be honest everything was overpriced for what it is so I don't think I'll be coming back.

First time here. Salon is very beautiful, and the service was quick and precise. But my overall experience could have been better. She did a nice job but said like 2 words the entire time I was here... Wasn't a very warm welcome.

The portions are huge but it doesn't taste good! Got the pad see ew and it was so disappointing. The beef tasted so spongey like it's been frozen for days and thrown in the microwave.

Let me start off by saying the result was near perfect. I'm happy with my nails. Therefore this would have deserved 5 stars. But here's why I had to deduct a few.   He was SO rough, he burned me a few times and cut me with the drill. I wasn't bleeding yet but he made sure I kept one eye open lol. His technique was good (despite the scariness of it), he took care of the lifted spots and he filled my gels in thin layers. But throughout the process he was violently smacking my hands around to 'signal' when he wanted me to put it under the light to dry or when he wanted to flip my hand over so he can file under the nails. He obviously has been doing this for a long time and he's good at it, but DAMN wtf was he in a rush for.. Or wtf was he on? Lol I was nice enough to tell him it's okay because he noticed I flinched, but then he continued to attack my cuticles with the buffer and leave deep dents in my nails. -2 stars.  But here's what took the cake. One of the workers walked around me, stopped a few times to take a good look at me then proceeded to make comments about me in Vietnamese. A language that I speak. Oh but I guess she didn't know that? Or she's just so used to trash talking on people all day that she doesn't know how to hold back? It was totally uncalled for and without reason. Minus 2 more stars for being unprofessional and flat out rude.   My tech was nice, he apologized for the cuts and for his coworker's distasteful personality. (While paying I mentioned that I understood what she said. Lol @ his face turning green.) It was still pretty much a bad experience but like I said in the beginning, the results are nice. And this place stays open later than most nail salons. I think I would have toughen it out and be a regular here if that woman kept her mouth shut. I have zero tolerance for using a non-English language to attack people and trash talk when they're not even your customer, your comments are irrelevant, and when the customer is still within the salon! Smh...

"Unphogettable" is right because I will definitely never forget how much this place sucks!   Everything looked and tasted so cheap! The nem cuon is all lettuce (no mints), the pho broth is bland, you get like 4 pieces of meat in total even when you order dac biet. Therefore this place is overpriced as hell! I have nothing good to say, it's probably the WORST vietnamese restaurant in the phoenix+mesa+chandler+tempe area combined. Take your business to com tam thuan kieu or pho van.

They get you in and out fast and do 48 hr rain checks! 100% hand wash and hand dry. Sometimes there are still water spots so I deducted a star but I feel like that happens almost everywhere.

I think I expected too much.... I would have been better off sitting at home ordering pasta and bread sticks from pizza hut. That's how much I regret coming here. The shrimp alfredo pasta was ridiculous, basically just boiled fettuccine and cheap alfredo sauce from a jar and probably frozen shrimp that's just been boiled. The bread sticks tasted ok but like I said, pizza hut could have done it better. And the salad? Oh my god... Just plain iceberg lettuce and crappy store bought vinaigrette. Nothing tasted authentic restaurant made, it was like cafeteria food!

The short rib, skip. It's way too dry and basic for my taste buds. The crab cakes are also not that special here. But since I LOVE the chopped salad here, I get that Togo almost every week. It's also good with extra tomatoes upon request.

Alright so first impression of this place was WOW what a nice setting. Truly pleasing to the eye. The lighting is a lot darker than what you see in pictures, but they light plenty of candles.   I like how they place a heated beanbag on your lower back, it helps relieve the tension right there. A lot of places don't know or don't understand that people with lower back pain CAN'T lay flat on their back without any cushion to support, because it could be extremely painful. Now let's fast forward to the massage....she was ok. Wasn't bad but wasn't good enough either. She elbowed my shoulders lol how is that supposed to feel good? But who knows maybe I'll get someone better next time. I also didn't like how the men and women were whispering to each other in their language. Don't they know we're all here to relax? And the bathroom along with the backdoor is right next to where everyone is getting their massages. Every time someone would enter or come out you would hear everything. It wakes everyone up.   Now after everything was over and I tipped my gal already, I come outside to pay.. The receptionist girl obviously knows nothing about customer service. Whoever decided to put her at the front should know she's going to cost you many customers. She was not pleasant to begin with, when I arrived she did not greet and welcome me. I had to say hello to HER and mention that I have an appointment before she even decided to look away from her phone. She also did not care to ask me "how was everything?" when I came back out. Haha, and that wasn't even the end of it. After I paid she ASKED me if I had already tipped. What? How unprofessional and rude. I understand gratuity is appreciated but here it's required. There's even a sign that says they would like at least $5 tips. Makes me think, why did I give my girl a $10?

Came here on a spur one night and discovered Coco! She's strong. A foot reflexology here is one hour for $35. They offer punch cards too. Be sure to give a generous tip for their hard work. I usually do $10-$12 because less is just plain insulting, trust me.

NEVER in my life of getting pedicures every 2 weeks have I been offered the file to file my own toes because she just did NOT understand what "straight across with rounded corners" means!! She kept wanting to cut the corners with clippers! And when she began to polish my toes I looked down and noticed that she didn't even take off all the old polish! There were still some flecks of my previous pedicure! AND she didn't clean under the nails (which is really one of the main reasons anyone gets pedis). My heels are still crusty because she did a crappy job of scrubbing and needless to say the massage was horrid and not relaxing either! I'm going back to Pink Polish where people actually KNOW HOW TO GIVE PEDICURES.

I'm really happy with my trim and ombré by Holly! She takes her time and she answers all your questions. I was pretty anxious about bleaching my hair again but she was careful and she recommended nice hair products. My hair is so soft right now! I can't wait to come back when I need touch ups and oil treatments :)

Last time, Holly left bleach in my hair for over an hour and worked on 3 customers while my hair was frying off in the machine. When I was still there I didn't notice how bad and uneven it was because I had been there for 4 hours and it was dark by the time I left. I came home and cried when I saw the mess she made. (See pictures) My hair was literally falling out and breaking off for months and I know I lost about 6 inches of hair since. She offered to fix it if I come back and let her, but I knew I didn't want to step in her salon ever again. She's not exactly apologetic for her mistakes either, since she said to me "you're just not used to your hair being that blonde". I probably only came to her a couple times because I thought she'd know what to do with Asian hair. But she's not as careful as I thought. Avoid this place if you're trying to find a good colorist.

Yum!! Leaving happy with a full stomach. Salmon wrap was DELISH. Never had anything like that before, and it was better than sashimi. Tuna poke salad was near perfection, and I say "near" because I think it would taste better with a side of rice. It had too much flavor to be served over a bed of that white crunchy radishy stuff that's usually used as garnish for sashimi samplers. Seriously, who actually eats the white stuff? As for rolls.... I tried the salmon lovers which was ok, but it had way too much cream cheese and not enough salmon. The Cali crunch was good. 69  wasn't as great as I expected lol. The what the heck roll was different but I didn't care for it. Another thing I wasn't too fond of is how BIG each piece was. You would think that's a good thing but when it comes to sushi, I want to be able to eat the pieces in one comfortable ladylike bite. Haha. The service was decent, although I don't think they looked or acted professionally. It seemed borderline lazy. I also don't like their dinnerware. LOL. That's a funny thing to say but presentation is half of what makes food yummy. It's supposed to look good too. Cheap plastic plates that are in shapes that take up too much table space can make eating unappetizing and uncomfortable. So overall experience would actually be 3/5....but damn. That salmon wrap and tuna poke. I would keep coming back just for that alone. Quality of fish earns that extra star.

I've never had a "bad" experience at chipotle cause seriously, how could you go wrong at chipotle? Ever?! Maybe it's just my unlucky day. The dude who was making my order just seemed like he dreaded working there. Now I understand that when you're having a bad day, it might be hard to smile and act friendly, but don't take it out on my food!!! I'm paying $8 for this piece of **** so make it right. He was being so stingy on EVERYTHING he added to my bowl, from the rice to the veggies to the corn, I had to repeatedly ask him "could you put more?" ...which I've NEVER had to do at a chipotle. Awkward as it already is, when we got to the end he asked me "anything else?" And I'm like, no I think I'm good, thanks. And then he's like "are you SURE??" What on earth! Now I'm getting attitude?!?!!! At a damn chipotle? Jeez!

Do not go here. Place is so dirty and unprofessional, with inexperienced people working. I'm walking out with my eyebrows completely thinned down, ugly, VERY uneven and a crucial area that makes my arc an ARC is missing on the left brow. What the hell? I clearly explained to her that I want them lighter but try not to thin them. So she cut them like crazy which I thought would help, BUT her technique was choppy and she did not know how to do it right. So she tried to fix that, and I told her once again, don't thin them. She said she's trying to make it blend. Ok. So now most of my left brow is missing, and both of them don't have a nice angle the way I like them and the way I explained to her. She admitted it was her fault so charged me 5 instead of 10, THAT IS HOW BAD MY EYEBROWS ENDED UP LOOKING. To the point where she decided to give me 50% off. Just like how 50% of my eyebrow is missing!!!!

Oh god why did I come here... The selection here is very limited to California rolls with different toppings. Most of my dinner consisted of mayo imitation krab meat, blehkkkk! I tried getting some raw fish rolls off the menu, such as the cherry blossom or salmon lover.. What a regret. It did not taste fresh whatsoever! I feel like they refrigerated it previously. They basically are very cheap on the fish, and then they load the rest with imitation krab meat -__-

My new favorite salon! They are so friendly and are honest with their work. My nails kept breaking underneath gel polish manicures so Jenny did a "gealousy" (hard gel/liquid gel) set on me instead! It's SO much stronger but nowhere near as bulky as acrylics. The prices are also very reasonable. $40 for my first set of nails, and then $30 for the fill. This includes gel polish on top! Basically the same as getting gel manis but without dealing with thin flimsy nails. I'm in love!!

This place is great. The rooms are 2 chairs each so it's more private than other chinese/thai massage places I've been to. I highly recommend doing 90 minutes instead of just 60. It's enough to put you into zen mode and maybe even make you fall asleep! But one thing I don't like is how loud it is when a phone rings. Or when the door opens or someone needs to pay. Too many interruptions. But still, it was good :)

From the outside it looks like a cute retro restaurant but you're in for fast food quality food. The Italian beef sandwich is SOOOO oily!! It was dripping all the way through the paper and made the French bread very soggy. The meat does taste good but it was still too plain for me, despite how it was drenched in oil. French fries were too salty. I do like the poppyseed salad though. And the poppyseed muffin that came with the salad was good. I guess if you're like me and you don't like fast food, you probably wouldn't like this place. It's way too unhealthy. It's cheap, but I could think of many fast good chains that are cheap AND good.

Very friendly staff! Didn't take long for drinks to come out. My drink was actually sweeter than how I prefer so I asked if they could do something to it, they did it without question and were so nice about it. Someone even came by our table to check if my drink is better now. It was :) first time here, definitely won't be my last!

The sashimi here is of VERY high quality. Every bite melted in my mouth. It's probably the best I've had in the area. But I can't give them 5 stars because after we were seated and we ordered, we waited 2 hours for most of our food to come out and one of our rolls were forgotten until the very end after we were pretty much done eating. Also saw the waiter give wrong orders to people, and also saw 2 other tables leave because of the wait. Sigh.. I guess it's worth trying out, but I can't justify being a regular here.

Messy and ugly bouquet! My boyfriend paid over a hundred thirty dollars for two dozen roses and I only received 16. One of the lilies even had a broken petal and half of the roses already look wilted and it's only been 2 days!!! Also had to pull out some of the ugly leafy fillers because they looked cheap and horrid. Do not order from here!!!!

I'm from Cali so I'm quite the picky person about Vietnamese food, but this place definitely exceeded my expectations! I like it wayyyyy better than lees sandwich. Their bread isn't as hard and painful to bite. It's softer. Now some people might not like that because they prefer crunchy, but I always pop mine in the oven first because I like it warm. So voila problem solved and I've got a perfect crunchy soft banh mi ^__^ also they put a good amount of pate and butter, which lees doesn't do. And the amount of pickled veggies is perfect. They'll ask if you want it on the side and if you do they put it in a tiny ziploc bag for each individual banh mi. Which is nice when you want to order like 10 for your coworkers, they can each add in their own veggies without everyone coming in and out of the same ziploc. Try this place out!

Great fish quality. Not bad customer service. But why did we have to wait 20 minutes for our last roll? Meaning we ordered 4 items, finished 3, then stared at each other for 20 minutes with nothing to eat. It wasn't like they forgot, our server kept coming back around and apologizing saying it will be out soon blah blah but eventually we just cancelled the last roll cause our appetite was gone. I guess they were trying to serve each table 1 or 2 rolls at a time instead of finishing the entire order at once. I really dislike when restaurants do that because I'm not trying to spend 2 hours to complete my dinner! Also, if people came in after us it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if they got their food after us. That's normally how it works. Such a pity cause we liked the food.  And one thing, don't slice the pieces into odd numbers! The monster roll was delicious but I contemplated whether or not to rock paper scissor the last piece. Lol

Summer special is $180 for 4 body massages! ($45 each instead of $60) they're massages are really 50 minutes and not an hour because they include the time for you to change out of and back into your clothes. Theresa works hard to get your knots out and she's also very nice.

I asked Shane about how long my oil change would take and he said usually it's about an hour or an hour and twenty minutes, then I mentioned I'm just a little short on time because I'm getting called into work today. He actually got my car back in 45 minutes! I am so impressed! And while I waited I also had lunch inside their waiting area, the lady serving was so sweet. Afterwards I went over to the massage place and got a complimentary hand massage! Nice! Definitely had a good experience at Big Two and would recommend to anyone.

I'm pretty excited for this place as it's the first of its kind in the area. Love the many choices of fish and toppings. $1 extra for yellowtail or avocado. Creamy spicy is good (it's spicy mayo). Being that it was my first time here and I was ordering 2 bowls and 1 salad Togo, I was overwhelmed by the employees rushing me. It's an assembly line style like chipotle, but the employees need to be trained better to serve people that have multiple orders. I get that there's a line and they're trying to serve everyone, but rushing people and having crappy attitudes = bad Yelp reviews. People will wait for good food. No need to rush each person coming through. And being welcoming is ALWAYS a good thing. It's especially important when the business is still new. However the food is so tasty so I'm looking forward to coming back :)
