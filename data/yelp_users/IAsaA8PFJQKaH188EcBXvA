Consistently good food.  Look, it's a diner.  You're not eating at the Ritz.  Flashback from a better time in American history with a soda fountain, malted, breakfast served all day.  Kristin was our waitress and was wonderful.  We even sat next to a table with two teen girls and their mom and the girls asked "what is chicken fried steak"?  I overheard and suggested turning in their mom to child protective services cause that's criminal.  We'll see if they order it.

After leaving Jos. A Banks across the parking lot where there were no coats in my size (54), I met with Stewart who happily showed me a nice selection in my size and with buy 1 get 1 free, they are tailoring both now.  Good job and great service.

Excellent food.  Excellent drinks.  Large variety from the healthy to the delicious.  Very accommodating staff as well.  Overall a much better experience than just a coffee shop.

After a horrible experience with another property management company, Lesser and Associates was able to help with damage control and is now managing the home I live in.  Like night and day.  Thanks Larry.

I have heard about this place for @13 years and a friend offered to pick up a pie so she brought me a blueberry pie and got a chocolate cream pie herself.  The blueberry was absolutely horrible, disgusting crust, dry, I threw it out.  I called her and shared my results and she said the cream pie tasted like plastic, equally horrible and discarded.  Is there a less than one star rating?

I am a "regular" whatever that means.  In sitting here by myself, I was able to look around and I am genuinely impressed with the attention to detail the staff exhibits.  The kitchen staff moves like a well oiled machine.  Each person doing exactly what they need to for the best experience.  Cortney was the bar tender and eating at the bar is great if you are alone because you aren't really alone.  The drinks were very good, food was ordered exactly as expected and delivered exactly as needed.  I continue to come here and I am continually impressed. After 7 years you'd think Cortney would be burned out but she is as eager as day one.  That speaks to the quality of the establishment to retain an employee for 7 years.  Good job.

Really busy and pretty quick service.  Overall it was good.  A couple things came out not as ordered but nothing worth raising a fuss.  Quality is consistent and good.  The owner, Oak, is very kind and accommodating.

If the amazing soup is any indication of a wonderful meal, we'll be back.  Ask for Cindy.  She is exceedingly friendly and made wonderful suggestions.

Jayson is very knowledgable, willing to take the time to really be effective with his clients, and actually cares.  He increased my coverage and decreased my rates.  He actively helps me with my business and gives me peace of mind.  Thank you Jayson.  Kenneth von Hopf

Wonderful food.  Also just got an A+ rating from the health department.  Always a plus to know the kitchen is clean.  Wonderful selection and fair priced.

Pitiful customer service.  It took me longer in line to buy my purchase than it did to walk to the back of the store to find what I needed.  The cashier called for assistance 5 times and when a relief cashier showed up, her demeanor was as if I was inconveniencing her somehow.  Coupled with all that, the LP girl was smacking her gum like a cow greeting shoppers.  Very unappealing.  Only upside was their selection and prices were fair.

All in all, really wonderful food full of flavor and a lot to choose from.  They only offer dry brisket so if you are a moist brisket fan, find something else to order.  Plenty to choose from or dunk the brisket in the sauce to moisten it up.

Sad, just plain sad.  The salesperson was kind of rude.  Nothing overt but far from friendly.  I was shopping for a sport coat and they had zero in my size.  Ok, I'm not tiny Tim but no 54s?  I too was suckered in by the buy one get 3 free.  Well, not if there is nothing that fits.  Went to Men's wearhouse across the parking lot who had a huge selection to choose from and a friendly and helpful staff.  Two coats being tailored now.

I just love the folks at Karsten's.  They are always eager to assist, they have a great selection and I would prefer shopping there over the larger stores.  Although my "fitbit" would prefer I walk around aimlessly in a larger store, if you want a great selection and regularly great prices, Ace is the place.

Nice staff and good drinks.  Plenty of room to mix and mingle.  I wish they still had sandwiches but after all it is a coffee shop.

I was fortunate enough to be able to refer Lou Parker quite a few times and each time I receive rave reviews over his professionalism and affordability.  He consistently goes out of his way to help his clients make the best decisions for their situation.  I highly recommend the firm for being unlike the typical "law firms" because their reputation is stellar.

Friends have used CarSultants a few times and one was a new Nissan and Brian helped my fianc√© get amazing interest.  Another was my best friend who received 0 down and 4.9% on a new Honda with a recent bankruptcy.  He is a miracle worker.

After waiting too long for assistance, general manager Brett found us and showed us exactly what we wanted for a new tablet.  Awesome service was worth waiting for.

I'm a huge fan of Yelp.  Looked this place up and discovered I drove past it for a while missing the opportunity to stop by.  All I can say is wow.  Seriously amazing food that would bury the competition in the Caribbean.  Check in with Mayor Eddie, who politely let me know I was eating my taco "like a white guy".  You have to get your hand around the back of it to savor the 17 different flavors.  He was right.  Great job...  The staff was eager to help us in any way.  Very attentive and fun.

After years of networking with Rob and referrals to him he has never failed to amaze his clients.  He currently provides my family's health insurance and he never ceases to exceed our expectations.

Never been here before but it's 90 seconds from my house.  The wait was only @20 min at 7pm on a Saturday night.  Got us in and seated.  The chicken fajita was great but I need to rave about the Carne Asada chimichanga.  The meat was the most tender I have ever had.  Really top notch.  Drinks were great, ambiance was great (newly remodeled).  We even got a visit from manager Stacey who was very insightful, kind, and interested in our experience.  Nutella empanadas are amazing.  All in all, a huge hit.

Izzy has been amazing.  He assisted me with my evil HOA board and continues to assist others in the realm of personal injury.  I have found him to be kind, attentive, and knowledgeable of various aspects of the Law.  He is fair minded and offers wonderful counsel with wisdom and insight.  I cannot recommend him any more highly.
