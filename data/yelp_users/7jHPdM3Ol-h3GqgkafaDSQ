Worst diner ever! The food is subpar, my wife got a blt and the lettuce was literally rotten, not a little discolored but ROTTEN! I ordered coffee and I dunno I expect my coffee at the beginning of the meal, the waitress didn't bother to bring it until she brought the food. Tried to her flag down for a refill I must have been invisible because she was ignoring us like a french waiter. So I had to go inside and get my own coffee. Dont waste your time at this shithole, they stay open on name recognition alone. I know many people will say best malts ever, good food but I will venture to say they are wrapped up in the nostalgia. Waste of money, waste of time, waste of space. Burn it down and build a parking lot, or a dennys at least I could get a cup of coffee. I will not go back, ever.

Pbr on tap, best cheesesteak in scottsdale and the pizza is good too.  If you are nearby go there, drink a beer, eat a cheesesteak and some fried mushrooms your stomach will thank you. This place rules!

First off the place was nicely decorated and clean however the hostess didn't greet us when we walked in and at a place where you wait to be seated, points off. Sat down, server was friendly but the coffee mugs were filthy and don't mean stained from overuse but looked like an old man was using it as a spittoon dirty. I order bacon & eggs, wife got the 11$ omelet. The omelet was huge and looked tasty my food was ok, they cooked my eggs rightt which for some reason is difficult but shouldn't be. My biggest beef the music was ridiculously loud! Now I'm no fogey and if you glance at my profile you'll see I'm a drummer so I'm not unaccustomed to loud music but this was freaking annoying. I'm trying to have a nice brunch conversation with my wife and I've got the wuss from counting crows whining about his girlfriend, if I was a no account hippster doofus with no musical taste this would have been fine however comma it was the pimento on the shit sandwich that was my eating experience at the egg and I. Since I'm about giving second chances to most places I'd go back but that's the only reason.

Just terrible, I ordered fajitas expecting chicken cooked over a grill, nope I got pan fried, flavorless garbage. The waitress was a ditz that couldn't be bothered and she forgot to comp the free chips and salsa. Oh and it was ridiculously loud we had to sit next to these old ladies playing majong and it sounded like a combine was driving over my head every time they scrambled the pieces. I officially hate this chilis the only good thing about the meal was the chicken enchilada soup which must come out of a bag otherwise I can't see how it doesn't suck like everything else. Bad food, bad service, way to loud, why is there no negative star rating? This place gets negative two stars. If the sign on the door didn't say chilis I would have thought I was sitting in a dumpster behind the circle k that serves food next to a jet engine testing facility. Thanks Chilis for making burger king look like fine dining.

I don't know why I keep coming back to this place. Ok I know the fries are ridonculous but I've had better service at a funeral home. I seriously had to wait to place my order at the drive thru while the cashier talked to her friend. Diggity dumb. I guess if the only ppl you can find to work there are meth heads then it's expected but seriously worst service ever.

I called ahead to Sally's asking for a specific product, they said it was in stock and offered to hold it for me at the counter. When I arrived not only was my product not at the counter it wasn't even in stock. The lady I spoke to offered a weak apology but she really didn't care my time was completely wasted. If I'm told a product is in stock and you're going to hold it for me you better do what you say.  Customer service is very important to me and I don't appreciate being lied to, I won't be back. Goodbye Sally's, hello internet shopping.

I love noodle dishes but pho is my all time favorite and un-pho-gettable gets it right every time. Super fresh, tons of meat choices, they take over 24 hours to make the beef broth that is the amazing base of the soup. All the fixings that go with it including fresh slice jalapeno I add tons of siracha and hosing to mine. RULES! RULES! RULES! The place is very clean run by a super nice asian family plus the restaurant is located in an awesome asian market that give 10% off everything. I don't know what else to say other then do yourself a favor and go to un-pho-gettable it is unforgettable, for real realz.

Its been years since I've had Jimmy Johns and well lets just say I wasn't impressed. This time however was completely different. I had the italian club and it was very tasty, lots out fresh meat and cheese on a french roll, I was impressed. For about 8 bucks I got the sandwich, a drink and a pickle that was almost as big as the sandwich! Definitely coming back.

First off this place is virtually impossible to find in the far back of the Borgata. A good friend gave my wife a gift certificate for our anniversary so we didn't know what to expect. We arrived at the restaurant and it was almost empty (one other table), located in a open air mall that was full of closed stores and empty buildings, not a good sign. We were greeted immediately and decided to sit outside since it was nice. There is a great view of a fountain out front, the birds were singing, grass was green so WOW, seemed really cool. The waitress was very friendly but took her time and was extremely slow and inattentive throughout the evening. I thought it was strange there was no salt & pepper on the table or silverware but I guessed they would bring it later, they didn't. We had to ask for salt & pepper because the food was tasteless. We also had to ask for silverware which was a plastic fork wrapped in a napkin, this is getting fancy!   The food was all organic/healthy which is not our regular fare but we were willing to give it a try since we are adventurous eaters. Waiting to be surprised left us severely disappointed, there was nothing special about the meal the best thing was the bread which was very dense and store bought. The chef got confused (probably by the 3 other tables that arrived after us) so he prepared the wrong meal for my wife. We ended up waiting for the right food all the while asking to get our waters refilled. I work in a restaurant and if the kitchen screws up the front of the house has to fix it.   We tried some tea drinks which were very good but I had a feeling again that was store bought. The waitress was very sweet and friendly but that didn't make up for everything else sucking hardcore. I won't go back not because it was organic or healthy but because the service was bad, slow, the food was rather boring, uninspired and waaaaaaaaay under seasoned. If you enjoy waiting a really, really long time for crappy food, ghost like service, feeling dehydrated from lack of water while over paying for it Fontana Di Amore is made for you. You've been warned this place will be closed on six months.
