The mozzarella tomato and basil sandwich is the BEST sandwich in Phoenix, hands down. If you haven't been to Pane Bianco you are truly missing out.

While I love all kinds of food Mexican is not normally my first choice. After hearing so many great things about this place for years I was finally able to check it out.  My dining partner and I shared the two beef enchilada combo, a beef tamale and a cheese crisp. The tamala was very mediocre. However, the enchiladas and cheese crisp were delicious!  If you're in the area around lunch time this is a must try (if you are able to forgo the opportunity to eat at Lo Lo's.)  Although be forewarned - the lunch rush is pretty crazy and it may be difficult to find an open seat, but it's worth the try!

Oh Cowboy Ciao..how I miss thee! It doesn't better than a Stetson Chopped and a glass of wine. Oh, and the mushroom pan fry and desserts aren't bad either.

Tonight was my third dining experience here. I came with my family and ordered what I have ordered each time..ahi tuna taco platter with a side of french fries. While there are so many enticing menu options, the thought of this dish always makes my mouth water.   The rest of my family really enjoyed their dishes, except for my mom. She really didn't like the red pepper soup, although she's not one to complain. Our waiter noticed she had barely eaten and asked if she didnt like it. She replied "not really" and he took the soup off the bill. I was really impressed by his service throughout the meal, but that was really above and beyond good service.  I only wish Chelsea's Kitchen was closer!

While most people rave about Pizzeria Bianco, I think LGO's pizza is way better. I don't think I've had anything here that I didn't like. It is definitely my favorite pizza restaurant in Phoenix. I highly recommend the roasted corn pizza. I can't come here without ordering it.   Down sides - it's always crowded during typical meal times and unless you're lucky, it's hard to find convenient parking

After walking around Mill, in search of a late-night dinner spot, the boyfriend and I ended up at Bison Witches. The atmosphere was relaxed, making it a great place to sit, talk, and watch some sports. Our waitress was very nice and always made sure we were taken care of, without constantly interrupting our conversation.   We decided to split The Miss Priss and a bread bowl filled with Cream of Broccoli soup and two bags of potato chips. The sandwich was fairly simple, but prepared well. The soup was creamy and the perfect compliment to the cold sandwich. The bill came to $15, which was well worth the meal, service, and atmosphere!

This is the best place I've been to in the valley for boba. Although it's a little bit pricier than some places, there is just something better about the boba.   I've never tried the food, but the friendly staff and delicious red bean smoothie with boba will keep me coming back!

Whenever I am craving something cheesy I always think of Carolina's quesadillas. Everything I've tried here is good, but the quesadillas really take the cake. The combination of fresh, homemade tortillas and gooey cheese is just perfect. If you haven't tried one you are missing out!

I really, really wanted to like this place. My dining partner and I were looking forward to using our Groupon after reading so many great reviews.   The restaurant is a little bit hidden, but had an inviting look to it. We liked the ambience inside as well.  Our appetizer (goat cheese & slow roasted tomatoes crustini) came out aboout 20 minutes after ordering. After the first bite, we were both underwhelmed. The crustini was very simple. Something that could be made at home with few ingredients and little effort, but cost $9.50. However, we were both willing to look past it and were excited for our entrées.  My chicken panini was not bad, but nothing special. Although, I might just be spoiled, having tasted Postino's paninis. My dining partner had a different chicken panini with buffalo sauce and gorgonzola. There was so much buffalo sauce it made the sandwich soggy and unenjoyable.  While the waitress was very nice, she was nowhere to be seen half of the time. Maybe she had taken a break, but we had to wait another 15-20 minutes to get the check after we finished.   This place has potential, but is lacking on some key points that make a great dining experience. Sadly, I do not think we will be returning.

I would have to completely disagree with Tom, Spices is one of my new favorite restaurants. I have tried most things on the menu and I continue to be impressed with the quality and freshness of the food.  The chicken schwarma is delicious, with almost a cinnamon after-taste to it. The falafel is not as dry as most Middle Eastern restaurants I have been to. Every person I have taken here has fallen in love with it!  The owner is a really great guy who is eager to share his passion for food and is willing to go out of his way to satisfy his customers.   If you want to read more about it azcentral did a review on them and I believe they truly captured the "true flavors" of this restaurant: http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dining/articles/2008/01/03/20080103spices.html

I love this place. The service is not always perfect, but the sushi ALWAYS hits the spot and is good quality. I highly recommend coming either for lunch specials or during happy hour where you can fill up on delicious sushi, at an unbeatable price.   The owner is so sweet, the staff is very friendly, and I think one of the sushi chefs has been around since I started coming here about 8 years ago. Sometimes they are slow about bringing your check and if they are really crowded the sushi can take a while since there is normally only one or two sushi chefs working, but I find both things totally excusable because the sushi and prices are so great.

I had never heard much about Eddie's House so I was skeptical when I was invited to dinner. I was in for a lovely surprise.   My table started out with the Toasted Horseradish-Mashed Potato Stuffed Shrimp and the Grilled Honey-Spiced Chicken Lollipops. While the lollipops were a hit, the stuffed shrimp had a bit too much horseradish. The best part of the shrimp was the funny faces that ensued after the horseradish kicked in. The bread was also good, accompanied by a pesto and blue cheese butter.  Between the five of us we ordered the Tuna and Halibut, Chilean Chilean Sea Bass, and Swordfish. While all of the meals were delicious, the Sea Bass really stood out.  Finally, for dessert we ordered the Crème Brûlée and a Chocolate Chip cookie dough Tiramisu . The Tiramisu was delicious and unique!  We were also impressed by the service. Not only was our waitress patient and helpful, but Eddie's wife came over to check on us twice. She was really nice and wanted to make sure everything was to our liking - great service!  I am already looking forward to returning to Eddie's House.

My brother and I decided to get some take out and thought this would be a great place to try. We shared curry chicken, the Lakhnavi Shahi Paneer,  an order of rice and order of garlic naan.  Everything was very fresh and tasty. However, the Lakhnavi Shahi Paneer really stood out. It was probably the best Indian dish I've ever tasted. I'm already itching to go back and try more dishes on the menu!  Also -love that they stay open til 10!

My dining partner and I had purchased a Groupon to Taj Mahal and were excited to use it. We finally got the opportunity tonight.   I ordered the Palak Paneer and he ordered the Lamb Rogan Josh. We also ordered rice and naan to go along with the dishes. The food was pretty good. Although, if and when we go back we'd both want to try something new. However, the naan was outstanding, perfect texture and delicious taste.  While the food was good, our waitress was excellent. She was very friendly and eager to help with recommendations. Throughout the meal she stayed attentive to our needs, but was not interrupting us every few minutes.  I hope to return sometime in the near future and try another dish or two.

After seeing the sign for Beaver Choice a few months ago, I had been eager to give it a try. I finally got the chance today.   I was impressed before even ordering. The guy behind the counter was very friendly and ready to offer suggestions. When I inquired about the salmon, he gave me a sample (along with beet and potato salads.)  The salmon was so delicious, I ended up ordering the Swedish cured salmon sandwich (complete with a sweet dill mustard dressing.) My lovely dining partner ordered the Fresh Mozzarella, salami, tomato & basil sandwich and we decided to share an order of poutine. We both enjoyed the sandwiches and loved the poutine!   Almost as enjoyable as the food was the service. This restaurant is owned by a family who has lived in several parts of the world. They are very friendly and willing to bend over backwards for the customers.  I am excited to go back and delight in more dishes on the menu.

My first time at Kanpai was on a Friday night for reverse happy hour. My boyfriend and I had checked their website to verify reverse happy hour times were indeed on Fridays. However, when we showed up and were seated, we found out they had recently changed reverse happy hour to Mondays through Wednesdays instead. As the normal prices were very expensive, we decided to come back another time during happy hour.   I'm so glad we gave it a second chance. This has become our favorite sushi restaurant. Is it the best quality sushi we've ever had? No. However, the prices are exceptional and the sushi is really good. We normally order 4 rolls and edamame for about $20 (including tip.) The Las Vegas rolls are the best!  The service is also consistent. The waitresses we've had have all been great and our food comes out super fast.   While I think the food is normally overpriced, I highly recommend Kanpai for Happy Hour.

I came here yesterday with my family for an early father's day lunch. I had the strawberry chicken salad, but added goat cheese. The poppyseed dressing  was awesome. The waitress said they make all of their dressings in house and they're all vinegar based. I appreciate their homestyle, more health conscious approach. Everything seemed very fresh and light.   I was also fortunate enough to try the brownies and chocolate hazelnut bars. Both were delicious and able to satisfy my chocolate craving sweet tooth.   The service was also great. My brother was over an hour late and she was very cool about keeping his food warm until he came and us staying and talking for a while after we were finished. I would definitely come back.

My dining partner and I ended up here for lunch because our original destination was closed. After ordering, we dove into the unlimited free peanuts.. so far so good. However, once we got into the burger and fries, our experience began to go downhill.   Maybe it's unfair, but I compare every burger I eat to In-N-Out. This cheeseburger just didn't measure up. It wasn't bad, but not great either. We also shared an order of the Cajun fries, which weren't anything special. The worst was right after we finished eating. My dining partner and I both had the feeling you get when you eat junk food that didn't even satisfy you, but instead leaves you feeling crappy.    Another thing- I spent $5 for a cup of water and a small cheeseburger. I could get a cheeseburger, fries and a small drink at In-N-Out for the same price.   Needless to say, I will not be returning to Five Guys.
