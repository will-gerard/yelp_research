Chic and trendy while still retaining a welcoming feel.   Looking for a quiet place to enjoy an Asian meal, I stumbled into Cyclo. Walking in I was immediately greeted by the animated owner, who made me feel instantly happy with my choice in venue. She recommended to go with the beef pho which was delicious and hit spot.   Oh, and they offer BYOB (bring your own booze). What more can you offer?

I brought my car to Dyno Comp after installing my BC coilovers at a shop in California. I came to their shop with my suspension completely out of whack with the preload in the rear so tight that my handling and ride were absolute garbage.   I met Matt at the shop, who was very honest and only charged me for what I needed. I ended up getting my suspension tuned in and I installed my Cusco LCA. Needless to say, their techs did a great job and my BRZ is handling better than ever before.   I highly recommend this shop, go see Matt!

Horrible customer service!   Looking to get a tinted front window visor, I called this company and connected with someone who should simply not answer the phone. They were rude, short and completely unpleasant to deal with.   Suggestion to owner/management, invest in a friendly receptionist, it will help your business.

This is my second time dining at the Mission. My first experience was quite positive and I would have rated this restaurant as five stars. Unfortunately, on my second trip it was quite a different case. My Bloody Mary was drowned in hot sauce, the chips were over salted, and my food was mediocre at best.   All in all, my experiences here have been a mixed bag.

What can you say about a place that has already seen the stamp of approval from Guy Fieri? Well, the positives are quite clear, good food at low prices and an endless salsa bar that pushes boundaries with creations like strawberry salsa. But with this success the whole-in-the-wall charm has been lost. My visit became a transactional act due to poor customer service by the sole waitress attending to all the tables in the restaurant.

When writing a review for a chain fast food restaurant like subway I'm only going to focus on three things customer service, cleanliness, food preparation. Otherwise, all other metrics seems to stay static, as you already know what to expect before walking in.    First, the customer service is always spectacular. Which makes me hope they are well compensated. Next, the establishment is always clean, including the bathroom. Finally, the food preparations are good and i haven't had any issues with the way they make their sandwiches.    All in all, it's a Subway but a good one at that.

Trendy atmosphere and great food, what more could you ask for? SERVICE, which place completely lacked. This is one of the first times I've walked into a place that I felt like they absolutely didn't wanted my business. Further, there was a complete disregard for sanitation. Displayed by the waitress that coughed multiple times with no attempt to cover her mouth. It also didn't help to hear her say, "I need a break" out loud so many times.   I'm truly sadden to rate this place as a one star, as I hope this was an off day for the staff.

Having just moved from California, I found myself on a quest from Mexican food in the chandler area. Entering Nando's I was immediately impressed with the ambiance that's reminiscent of a Mexican cantina designed in Disney land.   Unfortunately, first impressions were not an accurate representation of the quality of the food. The salsa was  mediocre and the chicken in my tacos was completely over slated, making the beans and rice the star of my plate.   All in all, if you solely gauge your eatery by its ornamental value, this would be a good venue for you.

Really wanted to like this place. It has a great atmosphere, very trendy, almost to a fault. I liked the healthy options but after tasting the food that was esthetically pleasing everything fell apart. This is the type of restaurant that makes people believe that healthy food cannot taste good. If your only concerned about the environment where you eat and not flavors, I'd suggest this place to you.

Finding myself Mesa, the allure of highly rated Republica Empanada was too temping to pass up. On arrival, the location was questionable but stepping inside I was reminded to not judge a book by its cover. Striking a fine balance between trendy while retaining the feel of a family ran business.

Good food, not great but that's not what you visit this place for. The atmosphere is very tending and affordable. This is not the quietest eatery, so it's not the best place for a first but it's solid place to go out with friends in a group.

Fleeing the monotony of the neighboring mall food court, I stumbled into Espos. Welcomed by the cashier and understated dining area, you immediately get the feel of a family run hole in the wall. I ordered the green chili burrito which retained the authenticity of a traditional Mexican meal.

Update to review:  I'm not sure if the ownership has changed but the original charm has been completely lost. There is an overwhelming feel of penny-pinching and cheapness. They monitor use of the salsa bar which is one of the element of this restaurant I used to like.   Adding to the disappointment, the food was horrible. My smoked chicken tasted like they scrapped it off the bottom of the grill.   The customer service also needs to be improved. It's a real shame, I use to really enjoy this place....  ------------  Walking into TC Tacos I was immediately excited by the discovery of what all Yelpers hold dear, the "whole-in-the-wall". On arrival, I was greeted by Eddie, who was very welcoming and suggested that we explore their chicken tacos.   Receiving the food, I would say I was satisfied but not ecstatic. With that said, they have a modest yet delicious salsa bar.
