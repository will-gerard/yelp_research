Food is so-so, but service has been "lacking" the last two times we have been in. I will not return as there are many choices in that area with MUCH better food and service!

What can I say? How sweet it is to have this amazing resort within 5 minutes of home. My wife and I could not get out of town for our anniversary due to work stuff, so went with a little staycation. Had a GREAT time and felt like we were hours away from home! Ate dinner across the street and chilled at TAPS for a while. Great place to grab a drink and some light dinner.   Will return often!!

Great course and is in very good shape! Living in Palm Valley next to this course, I agree that I would play here pretty much exclusively if there were a resident rate! Great pro shop and great staff!

Solid every time. We eat here about once or twice a month. Great happy hour specials and all day happy hour on Sunday. Highly recommended!

I need to explain the rating on this one. I am a regular at this place as we live close and find it superior to most other restaurants of this type in the area. I have always had decent service and great food... On Mother's Day, I had returned from a trip to L.A. and my wife wanted one thing for Mother's Day...NAKAMA. We went and they were not busy (as in most cases) and we sat down to order. I have a Passport Card, and usually get two-for-one items which keep the price down nicely. There was no happy hour as it was Mother's Day, and I guess I can live with that. I also had a check-in reward for a free edamame from Yelp. We were promptly informed that "because of our Mothers Day Special, we cannot honor the Passport card tonight". I asked about the special and it was a $30 plate that would probably have cost less ordered any other day. I decided we would deal with it and asked for our edamame to get started. We were told "we are not honoring that tonight". At that point, I was frustrated and a bit tired from a long trip and got up to leave. On the way out, the manager said "I don't want to let you guys walk out of here unhappy...Nobody honors specials on Mother's Day". I replied "I will bet Tomo does" and we paid for the Diet Coke and left. We had a great meal at a nearby mexican restaurant and all is well. All that being said, I love this place. The food is always good, but the fact that something so stupid as a free $4 appetizer was not covered for regular customers is somewhat unsettling to me. Maybe it is that I am whining about a free appetizer, but my point is that you just cannot find REALLY good customer service as readily anymore. The manager said he recognized us and STILL refused to even consider doing us a small favor in return for our repeat business. Not letting us walk out would have gone a LONG way. Will we return?? Absolutely. But I might not be as quick to recommend NAKAMA to friends as I have done so often in the past.

Already been here twice in two weeks. Pizza is very good. Especially the crust...  Service is friendly and prompt. Clean dining area and the special was a good deal at 12.95 for a large pizza and two salads.  We will be back often...SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS!!

Always good food and service but yet another reason to love this place...there is a young man who works here. Always friendly and works hard. While we were there an older couple came in with the lady being in a wheelchair. This kid RAN across the dining area to hold the door and get them comfortably seated. You just don't see that stuff any more! Attitude and the desire to make someone happy is a big indicator of the work ethic of a person and this young man is awesome!

The food was so-so and the service was VERY slow. Need to figure it out if they are going to last here! Taco Tuesday ends at 4pm (kind of a bummer) but the 99 cent margaritas were fairly decent!

Per another reviewer on this page, watch out for the over-rated yogurt place on the mean streets of Palm Valley! The patrons at the Black Angus, the day care, and the Applebee's adjacent to the store are pretty shady. And a YOGURT shop hiring teenagers?? WHAAAAAT??!! Sensing my sarcasm yet??? This place is impeccably clean, toppings are great, flavors are awesome, and the owners and employees are friendly and fun. They even have free Wifi (I believe). If you are into your yogurt to the point of naming specific freezing methods and inspect all toppings for irregularity in size and shape, more power to you...I just wanna eat some yogurt! I am more than happy having this great place to take my family that is right next to my house...abandoned strip mall and all!

We were also there for RCPM. AWESOME show (always is) and that is the only thing that saved it for me. Danny Z should know by now that you never get a second chance to make a first impression.  Terrible system for will-call AND for pre-purchased passes. Gotta fix that ASAP! Non-functioning A/C is a BAD idea. I had a pretty good drink experience since there were tubs around and we camped out near one. Would highly suggest selling bottled water out of the tubs too! Had a good time due to great entertainment and the sound was really good but will hesitate to go back to this venue unless I hear it has the "all clear". Potential to be a good venue if some things are fixed and I look forward to coming on and giving rave reviews if that happens!

Jason is not only an outstanding loan officer, but a great human being. He guided us through a very tough process with ease. His knowledge is impressive and he truly cares about his clients...  I recommend Jason to everyone I know!

Small and friendly, just as it should be! Great unique beers and bartenders are friendly. I live within walking distance and will support them forever. A TRUE microbrewery with handcrafted beers. If you are looking for wine, wayery light beer, or a cosmo, try a chain. If you are looking for a great beer that took some time/effort, this is your spot!

Consistently solid beers and the uniqueness of this small place is much of the charm. Staff is always friendly and ready to help explain. I prefer this place over another local place and will support them 100% as they truly care about the quality of their beer and the happiness of their customers!
