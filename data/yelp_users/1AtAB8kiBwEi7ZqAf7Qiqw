Terrible service. We were there for an hour and never served our food. We finally left. We were looking for a new Thai spot and this certainly wasn't it. Would never suggest this place to anyone.

I am getting married in September and I just had the best consult from the owner and her staff! So excited to work with them and see their vision. Couldn't be happier with my overall experience. Yayyyyyyy!!!!
