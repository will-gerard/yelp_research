I've been coming here for years with my family. Tried almost everything on the menu. The chili rellenos are almost as good as my own! 1/ 3 good places in the valley with chilli rellenos that good. Beef stew tastes like my Tatas own broth, the quality of the food definitely doesn't go without notice and don't even get me started on the salsas.... PHENOMENAL!  It's a little hole in the wall,definitely... but it's my neighborhood hidden gem. My whole family loves this place! :)

I don't usually like eating here, because I'm always cold so I can't comment on that aspect but as far as the pizza goes.... It's bomb . com!

I've been coming here for years with my family and we have never had a bad experience. The family is attentive, the place is kind of small but the salsas are just like the ones coming out of my nanas house (I'm first generation here in America). The chili rellenos are a must try! Try to play around with the salsas on the chili rellenos to add extra flavor. Also... The caldo de rez is incredible. We honestly would pick this restaurant for our authentic over any other around the neighborhood hands down.... And it helps that their prices are reasonable.

Horrible service. I waited in line a good 15 mins to ask a question with two people at the shoe reg. One which was doing nothing, when I tried to ask, they kindly asked me to wait.... so I did. When the person in front of me was done,  they skipped over me and took the next person... um hello....? I found it very disrespectful. Maybe training staff on customer service is a must... just sayin

Best dive bar in the neighborhood. Debbie and Taylor are the funnest bartenders you're going to find in the area. It's a dive bar, take it for what it is. But the atmosphere makes the place

Every time I come here it's a horrible experience but I love the damn fries. Once I went in and asked for a veggie burger and they gave me lettuce, tomato and mayo in between two slices of bread.. And then argued with me about it before replacing it. Come on, I know it's not that hard, it's on the menu, not to mention the fact that they charge for each ranch they give out... Really 30 cents for a ranch!? Only Burger King I have ever came across that charges for each ranch... I asked for one ranch.. They charged me without asking and charged me for two. Smh....

I just moved into the area from north Scottsdale area, i have always gotten my nails done by the same person, Sonny, but when he moved back to Chicago i decided to go to beauty school to learn to do my own nails because I am very precise.   So naturally when I came to Lemys I had my doubt...but the man who did my nails paid a lot of attention to detail and did an INCREDIBLE job, just like my old Sonny! Definitely a hidden gem and I will absolutely be coming back! 6 outta 5.

I first came here about a month ago or so, we have lived in the area for a few years but for some reason we always settled for Pizza Hut, Dominoes, Sardellas etc. One day after church, I really wanted good pizza and I wasn't willing to settle... I had been to Chicago, IL before, but all we had was Chicago PAN pizza (which was great, just not my type) so I thought that's what "Chicago pizza" truly was. As I drove to Johnnies I was just thinking "eh I won't love it but why not just try it" ... Man was I wrong. The crust was perfect, crispy, sauce... Oh man, incredible. Truly could of are a whole pizza by myself. My family and I are obsessed. Not too long ago we went and they were closed!!! (Family went on vacation.. Good for them!) So I grabbed my sister and my children and we headed to another pizza place and we almost felt disappointed, not because the pizza was horrible (yes I'm being nice) but because we were really craving Johnnies.Thank goodness they're back, we went and had dinner last night, and this time I brought my mom along. She is a Johnnies lover now well.

Mocha latte was a little too chocolatey for me but the girls did tell me ahead of time that it was a little different, so I can't complain much, it wasn't too shabby with an extra shot of espresso on my second trip around. My sister, cousin and two kids absolutely love coming here and they ask to come here all the time because they love how these girls interact with their guests. Honestly, for the most part there will be a bit of a wait but it's always worth it. :)

My brother took my family here earlier today,  we grew up in a vegetarian household my whole life, and let me say, everything was amazing. We got the pad thai, egg rolls, spring rolls, Kung po, and golden something (sorry don't remember the name), even the drinks! The service was incredible and the owners daughter was the cherry on top of our expirence. 11/10 my friends.

My friends and I came to get pizza last night, never tried the wings so we asked the lady in front which ones she thought were the spicest wings, she  rudely answered with "I'm guessing the ones that say spicy isn't it obvious".... THEY WERE NOT SPICY AT ALL! Then we saw some new pizzas coming out so we asked for a fresh pizza vs the one they gave us that had just been sitting there for who knows how long and they said it would be extra to get a fresh pizza. So does that mean you can give me a discount when I have to wait too or are you gonna still charge me a dollar when your pizzas aren't ready? MAKES NO SENSE since it was already 9 o'clock. I understand pizza isn't the greatest but obviously your customer service is 100X worse!!! If I could give zero stars I would.

I have a 2001 Saab 9-5, as a woman trying to find someone affordable for an import is hard but most importantly finding an auto shop that won't chip you of your dignity and of course your sanity is EVEN HARDER. I had been going to the same mechanic for 10 plus years and have desperately tried many others in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and I never has such better service in my life. I have all my family come here, and all my friends. Trust me, you won't come out of here shamed.

I took my family here because I had only heard/read good things. We ordered the queso fundido and it came with fresh tortillas, definitely a delightful surprise. The guacamole was fresh, and the chili rellenos were incredible. We will be back.

Atmosphere is great. Jen behind the bar is always a big plus. Managers are the best, just the perfect place to go after work, relax and have a nice ice cold beer at the bar..... and don't forget to try their breakfast,  everything I have tried has blown my mind but I crave the French Toast creme brule almost daily.

My girl friend and I walked over after having a bite to eat at clever koi and figured we'd just check it out real quick, grab a glass of wine. ... a glass of wine turned into a bottle for only $14.00 and we sat there laughing and chit chatting with almost all the girls in the room. Very chic and the ladies behind the bar are cute and spunky. I can definitely say I love love love this little place.

Went there just for a few drinks, the asu game happened to be on,  we don't keep up with football and had no idea. We understand you are crowded, our drinks took a little longer but hey, we only got one and our server was very attentive. However, as we were almost done with our beer, my friend asked me to take a seat really quick because I had an injured ankle and when we sat down literally for 2 mins (even tho we know someone would come and ask us to allow them to clean the table, we just needed a seat for a min) Abby came and rudely began to go on about her 6 page waiting list with attitude asking us to leave the table. Unnecessary to be rude, I have been in the industry for years, that's not the way you speak to a customer. Maybe you should train some off your staff a little better on etiquette.

I have been coming here for the past two years, about once a month... If not more to be honest... After all, it's right by my work. I can honestly say I have never had a bad experience and the staff are absolutely incredible. I love the chicken nuggets, man I crave them daily, and don't get me started with their waffle fries!!

My ex boyfriend is Thai and my ex mother in law still cooks for me, so when I look for Thai food, I look for that authentic touch that my ex's mom has. Usually my mother and I have been going to a Thai place 30 minutes from our house, so you could imagine how we felt when we found out we had a new one open right by our house! We went one day after church and the place is so cute! Very clean, staff was amazing and the energy of the place was incredible. The veggie egg rolls were homemade and to die for. We got pad Thai with chicken (my favorite) and it was big enough to share but you probably won't want to. We also got the curry, I remember they had a few different type of curries to pick from and am not quite sure which one we had but it was so tasty I wouldn't mind going thru each of the curries to find out . Definitely a 5 in my book, and we will be coming back for more!

So, I've only been here twice but damn it is good! All I could think today was "i want that delicious tortilla again" I wouldn't say it's traditional Mexican style food but my grandmother would still be proud.... And the amazing customer service is always a good compliment to their food.
