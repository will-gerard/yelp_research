I have ordered multiple courses here. The food here is pretty savory and hit the spot for me. The food is great but just not the setting.

The food here is satisfaction and so is the price.  I love the crab legs and ramen and udon soup.  I also like their sushi.  It's off the strip so it's less pricey and crowded.

This restaurant serves many authentic Vietnamese food.  The food is good.  It's the best in town.

The food is great but the combination didn't include much entrees.

I think Denny's is over priced with food that is not even good. I'll only come here for really late night because the store is not open for me to go grocery shopping.
