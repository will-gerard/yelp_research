Don't skip El Hefe for lunch. Tacos are amazing as always and they even have new taco varieties. The new ceviche is phenomenal and I don't usually like ceviche. Taco Tuesday is the best. You can literally try every taco on the menu for $2 each. Can't beat that.

The place looks cool inside. Menu looks good too. That's about it.  Fish and chips - fish was good. Chips were fresh and decent.  Pulled Pork sandwich - not good. It was dry and had a weird flavor to it. Did I mention it was dry? Mac n cheese - woah with the truffle oil. And the noodles look like Easy-Mac noodles.   We asked to sub out the fries that came with the sandwich. Waitress said we could sub for other sides. We chose the Mac n cheese. Bill comes with a FULL PRICED Mac n cheese along with the other items. When we bring this up she gets defensive saying she never told us we could sub. First off, don't tell me I'm wrong. Just figure out how you can make it better. And don't act like you did me a favor when you got it removed from my bill.  Not going back. That building must be catnip for terribly run restaurants. I give this place 6 months.

The Montauk never disappoints. Kardi, our waitress, wasn't only friendly and helpful but she was basically like one of us. Food and drinks are great. Favorable pricing. Great stop.
