We finally made our way across town to Organ Stop and the drive was totally worth it! The organist is amazing! He does the music all by memory, even the requests. The room alone is pretty cool with all the different instruments to compliment the organ. From Disney to Star Wars to Classical Pieces, my entire family (ages 1-65 years old) enjoyed the experience. They released bubbles during the Little Mermaid's "Under the Sea" which, of course, the kids loved! I'm not sure why people are griping about the pizza though. We thought that the pizza was exceptional and we're pretty picky about our pizzas! We ordered a couple regulars as well as a gluten free pizza for my mom and it was easily the best GF pizza we've had anywhere in the valley (go figure!!) 3 large pizzas plus a small order of fries that was actually quite large, ran about $50, fed 6 adults, 2 kids and provided ample leftovers. It would definitely be cheaper if you're not needing gluten free.  Sure, it's slightly annoying that they only take cash but they do have an ATM in the lobby if you don't plan ahead. The water tasted terrible. (Maybe that's just a City of Mesa thing?) so bring your own or just buy a pitcher of soda for $5.  Aside from those 2 negs., I would definitely recommend Organ Stop and I will most definitely return!

Last week we had to make a quick stop at the nearby grocery store before an appointment at 6, when we realized that we had a flat tire. It was 5:55pm when I walked through Community Tire Pro's door and asked if they would be willing to air up our tire just to get us where we needed to go. Even at 5 minutes til closing I was greeted with a smile and a genuine concern for us and our kiddos. They even offered to put our spare on at no charge!   When I was inside the lobby of the shop, my observation was that it is impeccably maintained. The decor on the walls was surprisingly attractive and overall, it felt like a place where a woman could visit by herself or with her kids and still feel perfectly safe. They had a sign that encouraged supporting local businesses and after our amazing experience there, we plan to do just that!

I needed to get a last minute oil change since we had an out of town trip come up unexpectedly but all of our typical places needed to book me a day or two out and the others wanted to charge an arm and a leg. I found Big O Tire's early bird special ($14.95 before 12pm) on google and decided to call. They had no wait just then and even still, they do accept walk-ins if you don't mind waiting. (Good to know!) The gal who spoke to me on the phone was just as nice in person and promised me 30 -45 minutes for the work. The store is right next to a Goodwill and there are several other stores within walking distance if you don't want to wait. I wandered around and sure enough, 40 minutes later I got a call that our car was ready to go. I will be coming back to Big O from now on. Good customer service and quick work!

Pei Wei is one of our favorites! That's partially due to the wonderful food but the management of this particular restaurant exceeds all others. The manager, Jimmy, knows how to keep his staff and patrons happy. We've been in on weekends and even on a Valentine's Day where the line was nearly out the door, but because this establishment runs such a tight ship, we have never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for a table on their busiest of nights. Highly recommend  their Honey Seared Chicken, Kung Pao and Mongolian Beef but it's the service that earns them this 5 star rating.

Such a unique, quaint place to eat with authentic Equadorian Food. The service is slow but only because the owner prepares each gourmet meal by herself while her son waits tables. Very good service, delicious food, and all in all a wonderful experience! Would recommend Mi Comida to anyone!

I stopped by for lunch today with my 2 year old and was met by a very sweet, friendly couple who run the shop. The food was excellent, reasonably priced and quickly served. There were so many lunch options and I was especially impressed with how clean the shop was! As a mom I didn't have to worry about whether or not the tables and high chair were clean enough...this place was absolutely spotless!  What won me over completely was the customer service. They helped me set up the high chair since my hands were full and then visited with us a little while longer. My little boy, who is extremely shy, was grinning from ear to ear and laughing at the owner playing peekaboo with him from behind the counter.  I loved that they weren't too busy to show an active interest in even the littlest of their patrons.  All that to say, I will be going back soon and I will be letting all my friends know about this little gem of an establishment.

After visiting the Other Mothers at 29th and Bell, I decided to make the trek out to this location. It was well worth the trip! This store is much larger, newer so cleaner, and better organized than the other two. They have a good selection (Nine West heels for $4.99, yes please!!) and their staff is very friendly. Overall, it was a really good experience! Even though it's a bit of a drive, I will definitely go back.  Now a lot of people have been harping about the trade rates not being great. It's tough, because you know what YOU payed for all your stuff and it almost feels like an insult when consignment stores offer you such a meager amount, but keep in mind, they have a business to keep afloat. They can't pay you high rates AND stay open for your shopping pleasure. They take the stuff they know they can price reasonably and turn around and sell. That's why your Jack and Jill, BabyGap, and other higher end items might not be taken. Best to try Craigslist or swip swap for those pieces that they don't take but you don't want to donate.

We came for our anniversary and couldn't have been happier with the food, service, or ambiance! The grilled filet medallions over fried rice is quite possibly the best dish we've ever experienced in the valley. Weeks later we're still raving about it! Besides the filet, we ordered the scallops that come with carmelized cauliflower and snap peas with bacon which was no disappointment either. Very rarely do we buy dessert at the restaurant since we have our favorite stand alone dessert spots, but after seeing "Spike's Chocolate Bars of Sin" on the menu, we had to check it out. Holy Moley! It was so rich, so perfectly chocolate-y, with hazelnut wafers topped with chocolate mouse and dipped in a chocolate shell, vanilla bean gelato and fresh raspberries, all lightly drizzled with chocolate sauce. Amazing! I can't wait to go back!   *** The only downside to this place is that patio dining seems to be really noisy. We ate inside but it's an open air concept so we could hear all the racket outside. Sure, it's a busy area but it's the birds that make the tree outside their home that are loudest. Weird, I know, but they were so loud, I remember thinking how glad I was that we ate inside.

This is our family's favorite BBQ place. Their prices are really reasonable. The portions are huge. The sample platter is big enough for two people to share but the food is so good you won't want to share! Make sure to try their fried okra - it's wonnnderful!

Some of our friends ordered NYPD and we got to try a little bit. We liked it well enough that we decided to dine in and get the full experience. Next time, if there is a next time, we'll order to go and pick it up about 20 minutes later than when they tell us it's ready. Their time management kept us from giving them a great review (because the food actually is quite tasty) and on top of a long wait even while there were free patio tables on a Friday night, there was no apology and a less than friendly server. Super disappointed because of the rave reviews and high expectations but I doubt that we would come back. They certainly didn't earn their Best of Phoenix award tonight.

Pier 83 is one of our family's favorite restaurants in the valley. I was a newbie fish eater when we first went and have since learned to love all kinds of fish. It's fresh so it doesn't have that really strong fish flavor that a lot of places seem to have. My husband's family is from the Pacific Northwest and they say this is the best fresh fish place in town. With Monday Madness Specials and all you can eat Alaskan Cod Pier 83 is very reasonable and could fit most budgets.   Everything is good here! It's a clean hole in the wall place with a neat and friendly atmosphere. Kids and Land Lovers would be able to eat here as well.

Pier 83 is the perfect place to go on a rainy night! Their clam chowder is better than any I have ever tasted and that includes some Alaskan restaurants that boasted having the best in the world. It's thick and creamy as you would expect, but they also know that people want some substance to their soups and so you'll also find nice silver dollar sized chunks of potatoes in your cup ($3.50/cup during Monday Madness) But who wants just a cup of this delicious goodness?! I suggest living a little and going for the sourdough bread bowl. If chowder's not your thing, you can't go wrong with anything else on the menu. Want something on the lighter side? The clam strips are tasty and their side salads are made with beautiful green leaf lettuce rather than iceberg.

Ah-mazing food! On your way into the restaurant you'll pass by a fresh herb garden that The Parlor actually uses in their cooking. Wonderful options for building your own pizza or if you're a little more adventurous they have their own creations that are fantastic as well. My husband is pretty picky about his food but with the build-your-own he was able to  create a pizza he loves.   The atmosphere is so lovely esp. at night on the patio. We always sit outside whether it's January or July and have always been very comfortable. Great place for a one on one date or with a group of friends!

I love, love, love, this place! Their signature burger, The Bueno Burger, is fantastic! We go about once a week and have never had a bad experience with their food or their staff. Delicious Mesquite Grilled Burgers and excellent guacamole!

Yu's is very possibly our new chinese food place! It was a sick day for me and the kiddos so my husband went out to pick up some egg drop soup and ended up bringing home their spicy orange chicken, beef lo mein, and sesame chicken. What a feast!! For those 3 lunch combos including crab rangoons, the best egg rolls I've had in a loooong time and 3 good size bowls of egg drop soup, we spent $17. Affordable, tasty, and just what we needed to feel better. My husband is very selective about his chinese food and he loved it.  I can't wait to go back again.

Our first experience was pretty positive except for the price tag but hey, it's all you can eat for dinner, so that seemed worth it. We decided to go back for lunch today since they advertised $6.99/person. Apparently that's everyday BUT Sunday. We had our 2 year old with us and didn't really want to put him back in the car and figure out another plan so we paid the $9.99/person and were seated by the hostess. Our waiter was nice but not really on top of our drinks or clearing plates. The food was bland and most of the the meat had a bunch of gristle and fat. We thought maybe we just needed to try some different things but it was ALL like that. We left feeling pretty cheated money-wise and not at all satisfied that we'd had even a remotely decent lunch.   All that to say, we won't be going back.

I've been dying to try this place out since I'm a huge fan of Greek food. Not the lame-o Chicago style gyros (They have their place...I guess) but authentic, homemade Greek family food. That's what you will get at Shawarma King!  The servings are large, colorful and full of flavor. My mom got the Vegetarian Plate Special and I typically don't care for meatless entrees but it was fantastic and so beautifully prepared! We almost hated to start eating because the plates looked so lovely.. almost. I ordered the Fattoush Salad and added the chicken shawarma on top. It was good, maybe a little pita chip heavy, but I would definitely order it again. especially with a serving of their garlic sauce and a side of falafel! (So good!!)  The prices on most items seem reasonable especially given the amount of food you get. They also offer chicken nuggets for kiddos. A nice feature, I thought. 4 small (McDonalds size) chicken nuggets and tons of fries for $4.99 seemed a liiiiittle steep to me. Next time I go I'll just pack a lunch for the kids or pick up a couple happy meals instead since they aren't very adventurous eaters.  I hope this place is around for a while. Business seemed slow but their food is excellent. Give it a try, you won't be sorry!

I chose to try out this bakery for my birthday lunch because I'd been given one of their cupcakes before (Almond Joy Cupcake...it was delicious) and heard tons of great things about their lunch menu. So we made the trek from the northwest valley and let me tell you, it was well worth the drive!  First impressions of the cafe: Nice location and really neat decor! Vintage/ Shabby Chic is the closest thing I can think to call it, but it's not so frilly that a guy would feel out of place. Some of the art was done by a local artist and overall it was bright, airy and very, very clean. The staff is AWESOME!!! If I could underline that twice I would, so I'll just say it again..The staff is AWESOME!!!  We ordered the Greek Chicken Salad, the BLT, and Roasted Veggie Flatbread and they were all equally delicious! They forgot to remove an ingredient on my son's sandwich and not only did they apologize and bring us a new sandwhich, they also offered us a complimentary treat for the "trouble"!  Now, these treats are the real reason to drive across town because their cupcakes and brownies are good even by gluten standards! I had the Caramel Macchiato Cupcake and it was delicious but then you can't go wrong with the salted caramel brownies either!  The loose leaf mango orange green tea was just another great component to a very wonderful meal.   We'll be back for sure!

After Pink Lotus closed on 35th & Union, we started the frustrating process of finding our new Chinese food place. The awesome service, large portions of delicious food, and clean dining room just made this our new favorite spot! Very kid friendly and very reasonable! $5.25 for a lunch special that includes entree, rice, soup, wanton/eggroll/crab puff. And $8.95 for a HUGE dinner that includes all of the aforementioned sides. The mongolian beef was so tender and the egg drop soup is the best we've had in town. The only thing we would change is the large amount of 5 spice in the lo mein but otherwise have no complaints! We'll definitely visit again. And soon!

Taste was meh. Service was meh. Price was way higher than any of it warranted. If you're going to spend that kind of money, you might as well go someplace worth it or if you just really want tacos/burrito/salad, Chipotle is half a block away.
