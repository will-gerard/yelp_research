ALICE AND HIS WIFE ARE WONDERFUL, THEY DO A LOT FOR ARIZONA, this restaurant is amazing and all the food is homemade, and the ribs are amazing, and, if you get the footlong hot dog, the bell rings.  This is close to CHASE FIELD AND all of the sites in DOWNTOWN.

Had a deal, it was not worth it, it was  a ripoff.  First there are too many steep concrete steps to walk up, with only one sided railing, cannot walk up with 2 people, and, then there are more concrete steps to restaurant.  Restaurant is not visible, it is all the way a top, and, it is high.  This place is as old as it was built, plus the deal the food is rationed you are not getting good portions, there is no desert or drinks included, and there is an 18% gratuity plus.  This place is not accessible for the disabled or the handicapped, it is really dangerous.

You never know who you may see there as a celebrity or whos who.  People from all over come to this HIDDEN store, you never know what you may find, if not they will notify you if you are looking for something unique, classy, original and different.  Owners are great.

this place is a reall hidden treasure.  it is like going back in time, and, you never know who you will see there, like a celebrity.  most modeling agency owners and women organizations come to this wonderful store for the beautiful gowns that you will not see in a department store.  the jewelry alone is from the past and future, but, amazing.  there is great vintage dresses, hats, and jewelry out of this world.  who cares what is real or fake, as long as it looks good and you like it.  the owners are great people and will treat you like a king or queen, something for all kinds of sexes.  no one is ever turned away.  you will be treated great.

he worst, the worst ever.  The menu is changed to the worst menu.  SCRAMBLED eggs is LEATHER, and, it does not look like 3 eggs, no one knows how to scramble eggs at all.  SAUSAGES were microwaved and hard, they do not give a bread basket, so, they gave us carrot bread slice and it was hard, PANCAKES were not cooked all the way, it was gross, COFFEE was never hot at all.  POTATOES were not normal slice, they were big, not appropriate for breakfast and not country potatoes with peppers and onions.  JUICES does not come with the breakfast, no substitutions at all.   WILL never ever go here again, neither will my guests.

THE WORST MCDONALDS IN PHOENIX, THIS MCDONALDS SHOULD BE shut down and closed.  THERE ARE FLIES EVERYWHERE, all over walls, kitchen, counter, tables,  they are on the food, food not cooked well at here at all.  HOMELESS TRANSIENTS   follow you in the bathrooms, and, the HOMELESS take baths in the sinks, sleep outside and hang around.  THIS is near a horse track, and should not have been built at all.

There is a $5.00 charge for sharing anything.   The Ice Tea is $3.25 and coffee is $2.50, if you do not like your beverage and want to switch, they will not take the cost of your bill and still charge for all the beverages.  The Ceasar Salad is not  real  Ceasar  it is made with pretzels and kale and a vinegar dressing (awful), the buns are VERY SALTY cannot eat them, the chicken which is $28 is a small piece sitting on top of a small glob of PUREE (AWFUL).  THE cheesecake is made with prickly pear cactus and it is very spicy.   THERE are no potatoes or mashed.  They changed the menu to the worst.  ALSO, they have no WIFI and once inside your phone does not work at all in that area, and, it MESSES up your phone.  DO NOT BUY DEALS FOR THIS PLACE AT ALL.

the store and company does not care about customers that are unemployed.  They will not help with making arrangements to make payments every month.  They are awful.

No service.  Prime rib salad has hardly any meat in it, it is all lettuce, cheese is lumped, it used to be big slices, it is not like the picture, hardly any servers there at all.

THIS theatre was awful, no room for your legs to move if you have any kind of leg pain or disability, there is no room.  The arm rests are broken and gone, the arm rests have no place or cup holders for your beverages which are expensive and no refills, the lids on the beverages are big and causes your  beverages to leak everywhere.  The popcorn is not free it is $6.00 and no refills at all.  The food is $12.00 and up, and don't forget, A MUSHROOM BURGER IS NOT A BURGER, ACCORDING TO THE STAFF AND MANAGEMENT THERE.  EVERYTHING IS MISLEADING and the management makes you look like you are the crazy one.  When we received the mushroom burger with no burger they laughed at us. We said if it is a mushroom burger, then it is a burger with mushrooms.  According to them it is a mushroom only on a bun, NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN ALL MY LIFE.   OH AND THE BATHROOMS HAVE NO SEAT COVERS AT ALL. FOR $14.40 A MOVIE YOU GET NOTHING, DO NO WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.  AMC IS BETTER ESPECIALLY IF YOUR A  MOVIE WATCHER, YOU GET FREE MOVIES,FREE POPCORN AND FREE DRINKS.

the owners are rude and awful.  They think they own the shopping center and they do not, the send people away, which is good, who wants to shop there anyway.  Great people that I know will not ever go to this place.  They would rather go to TOYS R US OR BABIES R US, which are cheaper and management and these stores are nicer.

this hotel should be closed.  THE PICTURES BELOW ARE NOT ACCURATE. the carpets are stained, the ceilings cracked and stained, cigarette burns  in bathroom,  no railing on bath tub to hold on to, chairs dirty, things on the floor, you could not and would not want to walk around barefoot at all, VENDING machines snacks were stale, the bed was bad i was in pain and still am, dogs are allowed in rooms, so you do not know what the stains were, also, feces outside and smells, there were bugs constantly coming in to the room, hotel has nothing to keep bugs away.  HOTEL SHOULD BE TORN DOWN AND CONDEMED.
