Our favorite dive bar in Tempe. Always deserted and they get to know you quickly. A few years back it made of the 'Best in Phoenix' lists for pool tables or dive bar, and then it became very popular. Fortunately, those people seem to have shifted to the Yucca on the opposite corner now. I guess I shouldn't wish business away from this place, but fewer tools make it more enjoyable. Cheap drinks and pinball. Weird wicker chair in the ladies' restroom. No food, but you can bring some in. Love the dog when it visits!

Our number one place for drinks and eats in Tempe. Always the spot to go for birthdays, celebrations, and post sporting events. We haven't had a bad beer or a bad meal here. Outdoor seating (with heaters in winter) is a nice option and you can reserve the back area for large groups/parties. In the last few years, they put out a hostess stand and there is a longer wait for seating, but at least you can take the buzzer to the bar while you wait. The parking lot is very small, but you can find a spot on one of the streets nearby without too much effort.

Our go-to breakfast spot in our neighborhood when we aren't looking for super greasy. We always brought our out-of-town guests here for breakfast/brunch. I always went for their "patented" protein pancakes and their skillets are good too. There can be a line on weekend mornings, but there is free coffee outside while you wait.

Great coffee, but it's always super hot - we always had to wait for it to cool down. The staff is always SO nice! The drive-thru is super convenient, but their walk-up window service is handy too. Free bone for my dog when I'd bring her too!

Tonight was our first and last visit to this place. We're big fans of brewery-type restaurants (especially non chains) and are frequenters of Four Peaks usually, but we unwisely tried to venture out of our usual places tonight. Our list of criticisms - while individually may not be big issues - adds up enough to inspire me to write my first Yelp review in this place's honor. This place may be new, but they have a lot to work on.  - We were seated outside among other patrons for 20 minutes before we were offered service. - The beer is not very good. Lager is horrible. - Waitress didn't bring menus and acted like it was an effort to get them - at 6 pm. - Burgers were overdone. Macaroni & cheese was good, but for $9 we only got a small bowl. - Second beers came in plastic cups because by 7 pm they had run out of pint glasses, even though the place was not too busy. - There was an attempted illicit transaction between patrons on the patio and someone walking up to the rail. A bouncer had to run over and ask them all to leave. Later, two employees (one a manager of the place) loudly discussed the incident right by us. - They apparently ran out of ice, and when the manager was informed, she loudly swore and ran over to call the ice company. - Smokers were way too close to the entrances to the building. They also kept sitting on a bench right by our table - still inside the railing - and it just seemed too close to people eating. Maybe we're just spoiled at not having smokers in restaurants now. - The waitress Shelly was just unfriendly and not responsive beyond the initial wait. When we would give an order, she would absent mindedly look off in the distance and then have us repeat it. She got cranky when the 1 minute she gave our friend to look at the menu wasn't enough  and she had to come back later - then she waited 10 minutes before the next swing by. We are usually good tippers, but when she gave us the credit card slip without a pen to sign with and without even saying "thank you" on a last attempt to be nice, we barely gave her anything.  Nothing redeeming this place.

Our favorite Thai spot in the Tempe area. The curries are fantastic and I found it hard to stray from them. Fast service and great for take out.
