I had the opportunity to go here twice in two days.  The first time was for lunch.  I was giving a presentation that afternoon and didn't want to have anything too heavy.so I opted for the Grilled Chicken Burger off the "Gringo" menu.  It was excellent.  I came back the late afternoon the next day for a chicken burrito which was also very good.  That time of day the place was almost empty and no one seemed to mind when I set up my laptop to get some work done for a few hours before heading to the airport.  Just what I needed.  I'll be back next time I'm in town!

This place is good!  Our server was attentive, the food was good.  The Oyster Rockefeller?  If you're on the fence ... get them!  Really good.  Even my buddy who is not into oysters said "wow."  I had the scallops.  Good, but kind of skimpy on the portion.  Fortunately I was with a friend who had the rib-eye rubbed with coffee (or something like that) and he shared.  Can't taste the coffee.  The rib-eye was very good.    Ambiance:  Excellent.  My only criticism is that with low-lights (wonderfully romantic if you are with the right person--and I wasn't (into chicks, here)) it's difficult for those of us who are colorblind, to read the small, light red, detail print on the menus.  I had to have my buddy read then menu to me.  Well, I had also just swam 20 laps at the hotel pool without goggles, so that may have had something to do with it, but since something like 10% of men are colorblind it's something to keep in mind.  A minor inconvenience, but hey, the food, service, and ambiance, all were very good!  Much better than that OTHER Phoenix steakhouse I reviewed.  Hands down.  Seriously.  You in the back, put your hands down.  I'll be back.

Hate to say it.  Sometimes it just comes down to the meat.  At these prices I expected way better in terms of preparation.  The people were great.  Our waiter was very attentive, keeping my bottle of beer off the table and refrigerated, then coming back to refill my glass every third sip or so.  That's a bit over the top to me but it seemed to make him happy.  Ambiance?  Well, the lighting is very nice, but really it's a big rectangular floor.  What are you gonna do with that?  Well, they put table after table after table.  Not much imagination but lots of room to bring in the business.  As I said, sometimes it comes down to the food and Wednesday night was no exception.  My medium rare rib-eye was at best medium-well and WAY over-salted.  When will these places learn that a few non-nonchalant flicks of the wrist in the kitchen with the salt shaker can quickly equate to the immediate destruction of what was once a very nice piece of meat?  I was at a business dinner so I just wasn't going to spin the cycles to send it back.   GUYS in the kitch!  Listen! (hands on your shoulders and shake, shake, shake)--lay off the salt and medium-rare means I need to see blood!  This isn't Wendy's.  3/2 addendum:  Only fair that I make note of the fact that less than a week after I posted my review someone at Mastro's reached out to me over email.  If nothing else they seem to be concerned for their image and as such they would like me to come back in and give them another chance.  Fair enough, except I only budgeted for one Mastro's visit in this lifetime.  I don't know if I am willing to gamble the price of a Mastro's dinner check on something that has so far been sub-standard, but I thought I should pass along that fact that they reached out to me.  When I am back in Scottsdale I will give the idea some consideration.

If you like mussels you have to hit up District's happy hour menu.  For $11 you will get a bucket of mussels that is seemingly endless (until you run out), a couple of pieces of garlic bread, and really good broth that's spicy enough to bite back just a little.  There has to be at least 20-25 mussels in that bucket.  It is one of the best deals going.  Happy hour will also get you $5 house reds and whites to go with it.  Ambiance is nice with good music, dim lights, and a bar of solid granite.  Now, about the bar--or I should say the barkeep.  The one thing I wasn't too thrilled about is how the bartenders seemed to be randomized.  I'm sure there's a written schedule somewhere but I have been coming to PHX on business and staying at the attached Sheraton (attached) quite a bit lately.  Rarely do I see the same bartender.  Every so often there's one that's there twice but for the most part, that's a wild card.  Customers like to build rapports and like a familiar face (Think "Cheers" theme) when they comes somewhere to relax after a long day at work.  Management--step away from the scheduling computer for a minute.  Hospitality and pure efficiency don't always make for the best combination.  Consistency brings the customers back.    Waitresses?  Chelsea is the bomb.  They have her going back and forth between the Sheraton lobby bar and District.  When she's your waitress it's a good day.  She's engaging, has a great smile, gets the order right quickly--AND she owes me a game of "Words With Friends!"   I have also had breakfast here.  The breakfast is fairly average.  The usual fare and because District is attached to the Downtown Phoenix Sheraton Hotel.  Overall, I would normally give this place a 3-Star rating but the mussels ... Man they are over the top.

Very nice staff, comfortable room, but dirty windows.  Hey!  I like looking out the window.  Lots of activity in the lobby bar that I didn't have a chance to partake in.  Next time I'm in town I will likely stay here again.  Love the SPG program.

I have stayed here three or four times since I wrote my first review.  The place is consistently good.  I had a chance to hang out in the lobby lounge as well as the attached restaurant/bar (District).  Both top notch with nice people about (both staff and clientele).  Expect, of course, to pay hotel prices for your libations.

Not quite the Nathan's I grew up with in New York.  Disappointing.

It's simply amazing how you can take a restaurant that has pretty good food, decent ambiance, and have the service people knock the rating from a four star to a two, but indeed, it happened tonight, and it happened at Stingray.  My work buddy and I went to Stingray for the first time tonight.  The drinks?  Good.  The tuna rolls?  Very good.  The sashimi?  Excellent (though the portions were small and the saba portions ridiculously small.  I don't get that.)  So the food was decent.  Nothing to write home about.  Now, about the waitress and the busboy?  Obnoxious--as in "over the top."  If you read my other reviews you know I try to keep it positive and upbeat and I "try" for humorous, but when there's a problem, I say so.  So, onto Ms. Obnoxious.  My waitress, Jane (or so it says on my receipt) felt it was completely appropriate to interrupt our conversation six distinct and separate times, to ask us how we were doing and to see if we would order something else.  No "excuse me," no politely waiting for a sentence to finish.  Just bam, in your face.  Rude.  Just the fact that I got to the point where I was preoccupied enough by it to start counting ... well peeps, speechless over here.  Take a hike, Jane.  Jane had absolutely no consideration for the fact we were the customer and the she was intruding, and let me make this clear if you are reading this, Jane.  You were extremely invasive.  Tone it down.  Simply obnoxious.    Next, (again mid-conversation) someone else comes over to lower the parasol over our head.  This, as I came to find out, is anything but a trivial process.  It takes five+ minutes.  As I repeatedly ducked he narrowly missed my head head with the metal support to the parasol two or three times. I couldn't help wondering two things:  a) does this really have to happen now?  and b) what special gifts from above have landed on that parasol throughout the day that are now in my sushi?  Are you kidding me?  We're eating here, dude!.     And then there's the busboy, which as well-intentioned as I assume he was, was hell-bent on reaching between us to grab dishes, some of which had not been used yet. Wow.  All in all MAXIMUS inturruptus.    Now--to sum up ... no need to send sympathy cards.  My friend and I managed to have a wonderful time because it's what we do, and despite what were well in excess of a dozen individual and significant interruptions we had fun.   It's about the people you chose to hang with.  But back to Jane et al, I mean seriously, people, you gotta chill.  If for no other reason, think of your dwindling tip potential!  Next time I will take my order to go.  Just proved to me how over the years I have mellowed out, because a few years ago I have had the manager at my table.    To the people who visited our table tonight:  I hope you are never in a restaurant and receive the service we received while visiting yours.
