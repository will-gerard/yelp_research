My girlfriend and I stayed here because it was the host hotel for our tournament.  Nothing went right.  We were not given the room we had reserved.  The staff was rude, our room was disgusting.  Hole in the "popcorn" ceiling, white stuff on a chair and yes it was what you were thinking.  Absolutely disgusting.

This is a really cute and quaint restaurant. As you drive in to the parking lot all the walls of the parking lot and the building is painted with Mexican forklore. Inside the restaurant they have a bar that offers many different types of tequila and a very knowledgeable bartender. The food was fresh delicious and had the perfect combinations of flavors. The guacamole  is to die for. They add pomegranates into the guacamole which gives it a a little sweetness with the spicy. I had the pork tacos and the park was absolutely wonderful. When I come to Phoenix again, I will definitely have to stop by here.

This is my very first time here and I would highly recommend this restaurant. Everything was perfect. I had the scallops over grits and it was delicious. Our server was excellent. He knew their menu, knew what we would like, and made excellent choices for us. Ambiance is gorgeous and they have an outside patio area for eating as well.

I came here with a group of 8 for dinner. Not only was the food delicious but the service was excellent. They were very accommodating, suggested items to share, and very knowledgeable on their menu. We ended up with about 15 different dishes and shared everything and it was all good. The only drawback  is that it is really noisy and it is difficult to hear conversations. I would suggest that the restaurant put noise dampeners in the ceilings to help reduce the noise level. In looking at the clientele, you could tell that this was the place to be. I would definitely come back here again.
