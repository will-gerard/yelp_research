There is an inherent dilemma that affects all ethnic cuisine in this country. That dilemma is: How authentic are we going to make this restaurant? Basically, this question is answered by looking at the bottom line. If you are in an area with a relatively low conentration of that ethnicity then in order for your business to stay alive, you need to cater to the tastes of the local majority. The beauty of China Chili is that they walk this line and do it successfully. Restaurants that lean towards authenticity typically tend to alienate the majority of people because its simply intimidating. On the other side, a restaurant that caters to American tastes is hated on for the watered down ethnic experience. What China Chili has managed to do is make Chinese food accessible to the demographic around them. The Asian population in the Phoenix metro area is concentrated in the East Valley and Northwest Valley. There are very few Chinese downtown and that is shown by the lack of Chinese restaurants in the downtown area. China Chili has understood this and has beautifully adapted their menu to reflect the area they are in. In response to the people who commented on the lack of authenticity of the food here, I would say that I agree with that in part. However, being Chinese, I know that if you go into any Chinese restaurant that has Chinese people working there and you ask them, you'll find that there are additional items that the kitchen can make for people who are looking for that authentic experience. China Chili is no different. Just ask for something more authentic and in most cases they can tell you what they have available. I can tell you from first hand experience that they have ALL Chinese cooks in the kitchen. Its not like they don't know how to make authentic Chinese food, but like any good restaurant, they know their audience.   Now to the food. Most of the things on the menu are pretty tasty. One thing that they do that most other places don't is tailor the food to your exact specifications. They can make it spicy, or less spicy, or omit veggies, msg, meat, or add basically anything you want. Some favorites of mines are the House Special Chicken, Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, Chicken Corn Chowder, and Spicy Garlic Eggplant. During lunch, they serve hearty lunch specials that after make you wish you were going to nap time rather than work(to some that may be synonymous). They have even more dishes that they can make for lunch specials than the ones they have listed so make sure you ask.   As for the decor....lets be honest. Chinese decor is tacky. I'm Chinese, I admit it. If the decor of a restaurant causes you to not eat there, then sadly you have probably missed the most amazing meals of your life because some of the biggest holes create some of the tastiest food. Its not dirty or messy, its just tacky, so please get over it. The Chinese are prone to gaudy, extravagant presentations, or did you miss the opening ceremonies of the Olympics?  In any case, I love China Chili because it allows people who would never walk into a more authentic Chinese restaurant to put a foot in the door of an enormous culinary world. And at China Chili they can venture in as far as they would want. .

I've been going to the Farm at South Mountain for a few years now. Its been a favorite place for me to take people when I just want to relax and enjoy the beauty of the outdoors. The ambience of this place is quaint and serene. And a tip for the guys, this is THE place to go if you want to impress a lady friend. They'll be so impressed that you picked such a cute and beautiful place. Trust me. ;-)  The food here is nothing spectacular, though you'd never know it from the price. As other reviewers have said, the sandwiches and salads from here are above average in price and just barely above average in taste and flavor. That being said, I think that some of their sandwiches are great ideas and actually have quite fresh ingredients. I love a chicken salad sandwich that actually has chuncks of chicken in it and not just a trace of what could have at one time been chicken. The best part of the meal could possibly be the little baskets that they put your food in. But, like I said, they food isn't bad, but its not spectacular for the price you pay.   I highly recommend this restaurant that is so much more than a restaurant. From the trees and picnip benches to the little shop in the back to the gardens, this place is an oasis in a hectic city.

It seems to me a strange decision to take your typical vietnamese restaurant and turn it into a not-so-typical vietnamese restaurant and then raise the prices, but not the quality. The old vietnamese restaurant that stood in the same place was typical and nothing to write home about. When I saw the new place pop up a couple years ago, I was intrigued but never thought to go there, being that there are at least 2 restaurants in that same plaza that I would much rather go to. But I had the urge to try it with a friend and I came out unimpressed. There are about 5-7 Vietnamese places within a 10 mile radius of this place and I find it strange that their prices are higher than all the rest. Their soup in pho wasnt especially good, though it was passable. Their rice dishes seemed to be on par with others but for the price you would expect more. The only redeeming thing about this place would be the more contemporary decor that you don't see in most other Vietnamese places. It was cleaner and from the table setup you could tell they are aiming for a higher echelon of clientele.    The bottom line: The food was ok. The ambience was better than most. If you care about such things then this may be the place for you. As for me, I'd rather save a couple bucks, endure a nondescript dining area and go to one of the many places just minutes away.

I doubt anyone will read this, but I feel compelled to say that this is the perfect place to go if you have absolutely nowhere to go. The service here, in the afternoons no less, is consistently slow. As fun as unpredictability can be, I don't feel like playing Russian roulette drive thru because the waits here make you want to blow your brains out. One time I pulled in and ordered an iced tea. Just a typical, unsweetened, no lemon iced tea. IT TOOK 13 MINUTES!! I feel like if there's ever a time you could go into a kitchen and learn how to do fix your order and then come out in less time than it took for you to get an order, there's a problem. The only thing I'm unsure of is if its just the employees who are slow or if the inside of the kitchen is actually another dimension in which time slows down and thus making orders coming out of the kitchen take three times as long as any other Sonic takes.

My experience at this restaurant was probably one of the worst I've ever had. My friends and I went there for a Suns game and were seated at a booth near the door. As we were sitting there, a girl who was waiting for a table, looked above our table and saw a cockroach crawling right over our table. Now granted, I have a phobia of bugs, and especially roaches, but this seems to me, like a pretty big deal. After the initial scare, I informed our waitress of this and she freaked out for a second, and ran off to tell someone. She didnt return for another 5 minutes, though it was only to bring drinks. I then told the host near the door and he exclaimed that it was horrible and he walked away(apparently to get someone?). After another 10 minutes still nothing happened so I found the guy again and told him nothing has been done yet. By this time, the others at my table had gotten their food. He told me that since it was so high on the ceiling there was no way for him to get to it. Now, I'm no engineer, or trained exterminator, but I had about 2-3 different ideas on how to get to the roach. I didnt realize he was stumped. I felt like I should make a bigger deal about it, but instead I left. I don't feel like anyone should be forced to eat in those conditions, without at least an attempt to rectify it. I mean, I dont have any delusions about spic and span restaurants. I know restaurants are dirty, but to have a roach hanging over our table is unacceptable. And the only reason the management would do nothing is because it would have made a scene. I guarantee you if everyone else in the restaurant had seen it or was experiencing it, SOMETHING would have been done. For us to have to endure it because no else was being affected is basically saying we dont matter enough for them to do anything.   How was the food you ask? I didnt even see it since I was focusing on the large roach hanging over my table.

This is probably one of the better Chinese restaurants in the area. I live down the street, and given the myriad of quality Chinese places around me, this is still my choice most of the time. They've got some great authentic dishes, but still have your standard safe options for the less adventurous. They have fresh seafood and specials depending on the availability of ingredients. One thing I like about them is that the chow mein, fried rice, chow fun, and rice noodles here are priced reasonably compared to other places at around $5.50. I'm constantly surprised at how much consumers are gouged for rice or noodles that cost almost nothing. If I can buy a bag of rice for $10 and make rice for a small army, why do I get charged $8 for a small portion with some meat and veggies added. Thank you Tao Garden for not trying to screw us over.   In any case, the food here really is great and as authentic as you would want. I recommend the salt and pepper pork chop, the beef stew(not for the faint of heart beef eaters, i.e. tripe and tendon), singapore rice noodles, kung pao chicken, and curry chicken.   As I've said before, don't go to a Chinese restaurant expecting good service. You'll be disappointed almost anytime. Look for great food, and let the food speak for itself.

Lets just say that any place that has footlong sandwiches for less than $3 automatically gets at least 3 stars. I've had sandwiches in more authentic places and honestly, they werent that much better. For those people who are not so keen into the Vietnamese style sandwiches they do have delicious sandwiches on buttery broissants for not too much more. Lee's seems to do a little bit of everything, and they do it pretty decently. The smoothies and boba here are pretty run of the mill, nothing too special. The gelato is sub-par compared to other places nearby. However, the danishes and baked goods are pretty good and all for a good price. I would stay away from the lettuce-ridden goi-cuon(vietnamese summer rolls) and the pate chauds which are more of a hassle to clean up than anything and way too much work to get at the tiny ball of pate in the middle. Some shining stars there are the grilled pork sandwich, the special combination sandwich, and the hot ham and cheese croissant pastries(make sure to get there early so these are fresh).  Don't forget to bring cash although they do have an atm right in the middle of the restaurant.

The time I spent in Hermosillo, Mexico has been some of the best I've ever enjoyed. One of the best parts of going to Mexico is the amazing food, most of the time purchased from street vendors and taco stands. Going to this little taco shop brings me right back there.  They have a big array of meats that you can put into a taco-corn tortillas of course. The lengua(tongue) and cabeza(head) tacos are excellent. Most people are put off by these but I assure you if someone did tell you it was from these parts, you wouldnt even know. The carne asada(steak) is a step above most other places and the carnitas(shredded pork) is melt in your mouth tender and full of flavor.   Unfortunately, I have never seen the smokin' hot taco girl and therefore cannot give this place 5 stars. But if these posts are correct, then truly, it is I who is the loser here. I would recommend this place over almost all Mexican food places in the area. If you are looking for authentic flavor and the possibility of seeing a hot girl, this is the place for you.

I've been a huge fan of this little shop for quite a while. Ever since I saw them on the news and when down and had their gelato and talked to the owners, I knew there was something special here. This place is owned by a lovely and very nice couple who are passionate about what they do. The husband learned the art of making gelato from a master in Italy. You can taste the quality ingredients he uses. Their pistachio flavored gelato is like no other place I've been to. The reason they were on tv a while back is because he made a white truffle(mushroom) gelato for a local chef. I mentioned seeing the spot on tv and he offered me a taste of his creation. It was deep and musky like truffles are but paired expertly with the sweetness and texture of the gelato. A true master of his craft if you ask me. Highly recommended.
