The guys at Slippery Pig were able to to find me a great solution to my unique problem, and they were friendly to boot.  I've got 4 kids (7, 5, 3, and 2), and I wanted something that would allow me to tow all of them.  I'd been to a few other shops, and they were only able to put together solutions that would allow me to tow 3 of them.  They recommended a Kona Ute (http://www.konaworld.com/bike.cfm?content=ute, which they sell for $150 less than MSRP) and they added on a second handlebar under the peddlers seat.  My oldest sits on the rack and holds onto the handlebars, my second sits behind him on the rack and holds onto him like a motorcycle passenger.  The 2 youngest sit in a quick release trailer/jogging stroller.  Not only did they meet my needs, but they were very cool.  Erik (owner) and Aaron (manager) were very accommodating and let me test ride the bike and explained terms I wasn't familiar with.  They showed me how to do maintenance, how to quickly detach and collapse the trailer, etc.  They quickly installed slimed tires and the optional third gear quickly and happily.  Definitely recommend them as friendly, knowledgeable, and competitively priced.

This store rocks!  They invited me to park my bike inside, and then helped me find some parts I need to modify it.  It took a lot of going and coming to to get it right, but they did it patiently and went far beyond anything I would have asked. It was truly amazing service for what would ultimately be a  $20 sale.  I wanted to tip the associate, but found out after it was all over that he was the owner.

I took my daughter here for her 6th birthday.  The employees really embraced the event!  They set the table with birthday confetti, had all signed a card beforehand, and were very kind and accommodating.  The chef prepared a few extra treats for us, including mini grilled cheese sandwiches that were quite delicious.  The meal was delightful as well, of course. Our server made wonderful recommendations that were kid friendly.  The appetizer, the muses, the main course, and dessert were all spectacular.  Highly recommended for any occasion.

I love Cyprus Grill because I love lemon.  My 3 favorite things are:  Greek Fries - French Fries with feta cheese, lemon sauce, and seasonings.  They're freaking spectacular.  Fried Calamari - You can get it by itself or on a salad.  The calamari is fried light and crispy.  Never gummy/rubbery.  And of course you get to squeeze fresh lemon on it :)  Avgolemono Soup - A lemon and rice cream soup.  It's scrumptious.  So if you're in the mood for a little citrus zest with your meal, I highly recommend you make a trip to Cyprus!

Simply put, these guys really bailed me out, and at an amazing price.  I showed up at 2:00 p.m. on a Saturday needing 4 pieces of an outfit pressed and the pants hemmed before they closed.  They delivered... only an hour later... and for only $10.  Nothing else I could say could communicate more than that.

Happy hour at Brio is awesome.  The ambiance is amazing, and the food is extremely inexpensive, while being decent portions and absolutely scrumptious.  If you're curious, my personal favorite is the spicy shrimp and eggplant.  Aside from regular happy hour attendance, I've also hosted a special event on the covered North patio.  Everything was absolutely perfect, from the decor to the personable and knowledgeable servers.  It rained and was a bit cold, but the heaters more than made up for it.  Additionally, the rain made it so that or event was significantly under-attended relative to our predictions.  The management staff was extremely gracious.  Whether it's for an informal happy hour or an important exclusive event, Brio is a great choice!

God made Revo Burrito, and saw that it was good.  Spectacular lemonades.  Tasty salsas.  Amazing fish tacos.  Try it!

I was extremely satisfied with my trip to Benedicts.  I had the pleasure of being served by Dawn, the owner.  Let me just say that her little place is as charming as she is.  The atmosphere is great for a small gathering of friends or business associates.    I had the bacon burrito and thought it was delicious.  The eggs and filling were light, instead of the greasy, over seasoned experience you get from a lot of breakfast burritos.    We also got a sneak peak at an upcoming menu item, the "Egg in a Basket."  It was a very cute little creation :)  After meeting Dawn and tasting her food, I'm excited about having her cater for me at a future event.

A cool little place with freaking spectacular food.  The tom ka is excellent.  And ask for the avocado yellow curry (it might not be on the menu).  You will be delighted!

I really want this place to be good.  I love seafood and it's only 2 or 3 blocks from where I live.  I've been twice now, and both times it's just been... meh.  It's not bad, but I have no intention of going back.  The plates seem expensive for a joint like this. The chips were too thick. The salsa wasn't that great. And most importantly my fillets haven't been very delicious.  Maybe their shellfish and meats are different, but the fish fillets just aren't worth it.  The staff is friendly enough, and the service is quick enough, but I don't think I'll be swinging by here again.
