This is the WORST company I've ever had to deal with. I can't get anyone to return my calls or emails. I've phoned 5 times to try to get some assitance with something that THEY messed up on! Worst customer service EVER!

Great place! Incredible pedi's at very reasonable prices. The suite is clean and well maintained. They offer a variety of services so you almost have one stop shopping (add a hair salon inside and it's the whole package!).   I had the cucumber pedi today. $35 gives you a standard pedicure with callus remover, paraffin wax, hot rock massage and a relaxing experience.   I've been to other places, nothing compares. I won't go anywhere else and would recommend to anyone.
