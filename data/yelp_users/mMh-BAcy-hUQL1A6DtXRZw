We have found our breakfast spot! The service is always good and the wait hasn't been long to get a seat. We have started coming here about once every week or two. Have yet to be disappointed with anything that I have ordered.

This is my second time here this week! I came once with some friends then had to bring my boyfriend. The food is what can only be described as delicious. The menu is almost completely made in house. The drinks are so clean you can actually taste the components. We plan on trying the desserts next time!

So delicious, great price, and quick but doesn't taste like fast food. The coney dog was perfect not greasy, good flavor and they are hand made! Burger has great flavor, and well balanced. The cheese sauce is AMAZING! Love that they offer rewards. The staff was super friendly.  Alma School and Southern

The pizza wasn't anything to write home about. Flavor was good just the amount of toppings on the pizza was anemic. (Literally had 1 fragment of Canadian Bacon per slice) Crust was comparable to a Totino's pizza you can get in the freezer section at any grocery store. Won't be back.

Placed my order late in the evening asked for a phone call so as not to wake my roommate. What does the guy do but ring the doorbell at 1215am. Pizza was suppose to take max of 45 minutes to be delivered took over an hour, which is ridiculous since I live less than 2 blocks from this establishment. Pizza wasn't hot nor did it have very many toppings on it. I tried calling to check on my order and had no answer. This was my first and last experience with this place. Very disappointing.

Absolutely love this place. The food is always good and the servers are so friendly. We love going Sunday nights they always have multiple games on. You have to try the quesodilla.

It was nothing exciting. Food was edible but wasn't worth the $22. The place was subpar at best. Serves was lacking. Milk shake was terrible I'm pretty sure it was just chocolate milk.
