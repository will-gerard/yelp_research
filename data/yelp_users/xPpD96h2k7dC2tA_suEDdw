Great service, no rush, sushi came out at the right intervals making sure everyone had food.  Large portions of fish (as always) and no problem customizing your rolls. Been visiting this location for a very long time fish is fresh with great color. We will continue to come back for our sushi needs. Nice birthday deep fried tempura touch at the end.

Manager was Robert.  I use this location for tires and oil changes.  I always place a mark on the tire to make sure the tires were rotated, and they have always been.  I never leave the shop without checking the oil cap and plug.  I do take some responsibility for my own safety.  So about the service, appointment at 3:00, car in at 3:10, out at 4:10.  Had a bad tire and Robert recognized this as road hazard damage and replaced it on the spot.  Buyer advice, "inspect what you expect". So not all employees may be operating with a full six pack, but this is a laborious job, not one I would like to do.  Again inspect what you expect.

Stopped in to grab a soda to go. Not happening. No soda to go. Could have bought the buffet line and got the soda for 8.99. Price does not include the plastic cup. So if your dropping on in for a soda to go, forget about it.

Oh oh.......... What the heck happened? Been a customer of the Luna for as long as I can remember.  Went there yesterday with my daughter and niece who was visiting from out of town. For lunch I asked if they could incorporate some shrimp into my dish.  Server went and asked and said no.  Hmmmmm really, willing to pay a little something extra for a few shrimp, but the answer was still no. I guess they lost their flexibility to satisfy the customer.  Asked for the manager (Kelly), and she said the shrimp came pre packaged.  WHAT? Pre packaged individual servings at my favorite Mex restaurant? And would not open one ?   I asked how much for a serving and the manager (Kelly) had no idea? WHAT a manager who could not tell me how much an item was on the menu.  Bottom line, no shrimp, crappy service, manager could care less about a long time returning customer. She (Kelly) walked away from the table without a resolution. No more visits to the cave creek location for me. Ugghhhhhh showed my niece what western hospitality was for sure.  Thanks Kelly!

I have been coming here for years.  I used to work at Banner up the street and it was a weekly lunch stop.  Good size, just the right heat, the tamales are soft and melt in your mouth quality.  The owner is awesome and always recognizes me.  The green japilino sauce is a must.  I am very sad I nolonger work close to here so ever time I am in the neighborhood I grab a few dozen and freeze them.  After the micro wave they taste like I am in the store. 5 star for all.

Yikes! Went in to look for some live aquarium plants. No one in the fish department to help, plants on the rack were dying or dead, dead fish in some aquariums. Went and got the manager who said the professional aquarium person was out for the day. The whole fish department needs a makeover. Poor fishes.

Not your every day Mexican fare, went with my reviewing 15 yo twins. They eat everything. Must be honest, I had Tamales they looked nice but thought they may have come from a can.  Immediately thought "where's the beef" bland taste, refried beans were ok, salsa was ok, thank God for the margarita.  For a strip mall Resteraunt, not the best value for your buck.

I have been seeing Dr. Manning forever and a day. Best dentist ever, has a beautiful singing voice. His staff is the best.

Had a referral from a Facebook friend about this company.  My garage door was on its last leg and beginning to fail miserably.  Talked to Dan on the phone, gave me a great quote, included things other companies charged extra for and had a better door (heavy duty compared to other contractor specials).  filed  this info away and continued using the door until I squeezed the last bit of life out of it. BROKE! With the car inside the garage! Called Dan, needed a door today, no luck they were booked.  Guess who came out, same day to fix the door to help me get the car out? The owner of the company! Got the car out, they returned the next morning and replaced the door at a price lower then anyplace in the Phoenix area.  Need a door ? Call Dan at On Track.

Took my daughter to EVO for a drink and appetizer. Sat at the bar and were served by JAKE, amazing he was, entertaining he was, took our order, got our drinks, and managed our food order. Koodo's to the chef, food was hot, and prepared professionally. Loved the Rosetta Rice balls with Balinese sauce. Thanks JAKE for an amazing experience. We will be back. Did I say JAKE was a master at crafting drinks ? He is.

My wife and I visited this place a few weeks ago, not sure if they had been open very long.  I am guessing by the quality of service, they were still breaking in. Ordered wings, salads and a few draft beers.  My wife's beer was flat, and it took 15 minutes to swap kegs for my beer.  Menu price was different then what the wait staff told us.  I guess there was a mis print on the menu and they explained it would be more expensive then what the menu stated. (I'm guessing they could have had it corrected, reprinted, redacted, ) and just honored the price. (Am I to critical?) We were seated in the very lower level with very little air circulation.  The wing sauce was not what I was used to, it was ok but not that red thick wing sauce.  Wings were big and juicy. We plan to revisit once the kinks are worked out.

Wow! Took my son there tonight on a buy one get one free bowl. We both had spicy chicken with brown rice and veggies.  First the chicken, perfectly char grilled with crispy goodness, tender with just the right amount of spice.  Next the rice, brown I might add, sticky just perfect for a chicken bowl and easy to use chop sticks with.  Finally the veggies, crisp but not crunchy, soft yet not mushy. Great combo, and great interaction with owner/manager.  We will be returning soon.
