My first experience of a comedy show and this location. I really enjoyed my time here. A lot of the acts were very friendly and engaging. The only thing that could have made it better was if they served food.  We had to order pizza from a place down the street. I think the establishment used to serve food at one point, but I am unsure why they stopped.  Beware, there is a 2 drink minimum. But they don't require the drinks to be alcoholic which is very appreciated. Great environment and nice location!

If you want to experience a rude environment and customer service, than this is the place to go. We had the worst server names Kassidy who was very disrespectful and degrading to myself and my Friends.  We had to wait 30 minutes for our drinks and then our orders were messed up. I had ordered a loaded back potato instead of fries but got French fries. When I asked for my potatoes it was as if I was asking for a whole new meal. My friend asked for some ranch for her fries.  Kassidy delivered my potato with just butter and sour cream and forgot my friends ranch. I asked if the loaded potato came with bacon and cheese to which she explained she didn't realize I had ordered it that way.   I was then asked if I really wanted the fixings for the potato and my friend if she wanted her ranch. She never brought out my baked potato additions but I was still charged for the food. When I mentioned it she said well you didn't want it.  She then threw away my friends food he had asked for a box for a few minutes earlier. We had asked for a manager 2 times and waited about 30 minutes.   When the manager failed to arrive we mentioned her behavior about our experience and she replied that she wasn't rude the whole time. She also stated that it would be a while before her manager could come.  Luckily the manager, Evelyn was very considerate and was able to make our experience a little better but we will never go back especially if Kassidy is working.

I went here in Christmas Eve with my family. We were a little skeptical at first as their weren't many other customers but we had an amazing time. Our server was named Sam and was very funny and engaging with us. He had to deal with 9 very loud people and was making jokes with us, we even asked him to take a picture with us at the end.  Our chef-Romo did a wonderful job engaging the kids at the table and allowed all of us to be involved in the experience. Romo also did a great job cooking!  The only downside was paying 8 additional dollars for the Birthday special which wasn't more than a song and some fruit.   I've been to many places like this, but this place have us a good family atmosphere and cared about their customers!

This place is wonderful! The atmosphere is great and the staff really cares about their customers. Our pizzas came out a little crispier than we had wanted and they remade the pizzas for myself and friend! They were so wonderful and took 10 dollars off our bill and gave us a gift certificate for our next visit! The food was wonderful, especially the garlic knots!!! We will definitely be coming back!
