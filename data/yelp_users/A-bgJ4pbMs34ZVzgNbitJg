We are brand new Clients of Goodyear Animal hospital and have been so impressed with Dr. Megan Johnson.  We had been pleased with our former Vet at Estrella Animal hospital, but when our German Shepherd was found not working and very distressed, Estrella disappointed us by turning us away since they were closing soon for the day.   They did us a big favor and they recommended us to Goodyear Animal Hospital, where we met with Dr. Megan Johnson.   She is very compassionate with her patients and with the clients, she spent quite a bit of time discussing the options with us and probable causes of my dogs illness.  She is very methodical and thru some bloodwork we ruled out potential causes.   Our German Shepherd was found to have Brain tumors, and he is being treated with medication, and monitored by Dr. Johnson.    The entire staff has been great, with follow up calls.   I highly recommend Goodyear Animal Hospital and especially Dr. Megan Johnson.

They really let me down....we have been a client at this Vet for a couple of years with our 2 dogs and 4 cats.  We take our pets for check ups and shots and havent had to go to them for an emergency.  Well an emergency came up.....my husband came home from work and found our elderly German Shepherd couldnt walk and the dog was very distressed.   We assumed he must have had a stroke or something.  While my husband was loading our dog into our car, I called Estrella Animal hospital to let them know we were coming in with an emergency and may have to put our dog down.    I was then told that it was a Friday and they are closing in 45 minutes and they could not see our dog.  I had explained we were regular clients, and also spoke with office mananager who told me the same thing.....I was shocked and greatly disappointed.   We were dealing with the potential loss of our beloved pet and were being told to take our dog elsewhere.    Well Estrella refered us to Goodyear Animal Hospital which is actually closer to our house, who was able to see our dog immediately.    I am so disappointed in the Estrella but I do thank you for referring us to Goodyear Animal hospital who now will have the business of our other 5 animals and they will be continuning with the care of our German Shepard who has brain tumors.

It has been awhile since I have been to Aunt Chiladas....and what a disappointment!  Went with a large group, we had horible service.  We were not brought refills, the food came very slowly.  We had to go track down our server and a manager to request service.   Seems like since they were getting an automatic 20% tip because we were a large group she must have gone on break or something.    Food was very greasy, had oil ladden calabasita and a shredded beaf greasy taco.     The group I was with was a lot of fun....but the food was not good, and teh service horrible.  Next time the group meets it will not be at this place.

Wow!!!! Insulted by the manager.    We had just put our spoons down from sharing my birthday dessert we had not received our check and the manager came to our table to ask us to move so that they could seat the next group.   We told him we had not received our check he did apologize,  but it wasn't sincere.  He continued to offer to move us to another table since he had to rotate the table as he apologized,  I told him to not bother.   Until that  moment he asked to move we were having a great evening celebrating my birthday.   Food was great but the short bald manager ruined my birthday dinner.   Will not be back!

Love the donuts.  Tried the new Krispy Kreme and Express Donuts is so much better!!!   Love the buttermilk donuts.  They also do a great orange cake donut.

Ordered a combo of fish,  scallops and clams.   The scallops were cooked perfectly and they were  just fricken fabulous!   I am not usually a fan of clams,  but they serve a nice meaty claim strip,  so I was very pleasantly surprised at how good they were.  The fish is very good nicely seasoned and moist.   The owners and staff are very friendly and the place is very clean and decorated very cute.  They are a great addition to the West Valley,  I will definitely  return.

Really good food.   Enjoyed the French dip sandwich,  excellent! My husband had the pastrami sandwich  and was so tender and had nice smokey flavor.    We will definitely be back.

Customer service is seriously lacking at  this location.   Asking for a to go box for pizza,  the staff had attitude  and also when ordering.   Not going back.

If you are going to participate in AZ Breakfast weekend,  staff accordingly.   We did not have reservations and when greeted told we should have made them and they will take walkins for a 30-40 minute wait.   Yet we look around and had open tables inside and outside and also lots of open  counter space and told those are reserved too.   When asked if we could get drinks we were told she doesn't have e enough staff.   We wait a bit to see if the wait will really take that long,  met a couple who had already waited 30min  and we're told it would be another 20-30minutes that they are calling more staff in.   They asked about the empty tables they were told that those are reserved for people with reservations.   We left.   This was a FAIL.

Service is bad and the staff has attitude when questions asked.   Prefer MOD Pizza,  they are much more welcoming and the overall food quality is better.   We will not return.
