I have only owned a Lexus for a little over a year. I absolutely love my car and am so happy I chose Lexus. Richie Sanchez has been my Service Consultant for my Lexus service needs and I love his exceptional service. I feel extremely well taken care of and always feel respected.  Makes me feel confident in the service I receive. Thank you!!

Got all the way up here after David Spade. Spent a shit load on a couple of drinks. Got to dancing then these two high class bouncers pulled us off the dance floor for not having wrist bands. What?!  They never said anything about wrist bands at Fort Knox down below. We literally got kicked out for not having wrist bands.  Ridiculous. We atre just 4o somethings having fun and these assholes want a wrist band we were never offered. Never again. We have plenty of money and they don't want it. See ya.  .
