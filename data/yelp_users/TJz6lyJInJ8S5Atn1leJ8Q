This place is the SHIT. I just recently found it driving through Mesa, went home and yelped it  And found out they were making sonoran hot dogs ( ***Lord, please let these be good so I don't have to drive 220 miles roundtrip once every 2 or 3 months by myself just to have a proper sonoran hot dog and drive straight back***) and these things called caramelos.  These sonoran hot dogs were just as good if not better than el guero canelo down in tucson. In fact I would say they were better.   I never had a caramelo before, and I still don't know what the technical difference between them and a quesadilla is, but after eating one I will now be naming my first child Caramelo, boy or girl.   Eating these two food items were far and above more satisfying than having sex with a chick who is a 10. In fact I almost busted a nutt after my first bite of the caramelo. Which ironically will end up saving me a trip to the doctor because I was beginning to think I needed Viagra as of recently.   Oh, and this place is cheap as fuck. If our currency ends up experiencing hyper-inflation and losing almost all its value, this place will probably still be affordable.  The reviewers below, geoff, kelly, and gary who gave this place only 3 stars must have brain damage.

The only way I would eat at this place again is if my front door was less than 60 feet away from their entrance.... and I was a quadriplegic confined to a wheel chair for the rest of my life. Seeing that there are no residences that close and I can walk, I can confidently say I will never give this place a nickel again.  I walk in to blaring reggae music, which is fine, whatever...but of course I have some douchebag in front of me with his girlfriend slowly dancing to the reggae music for a full 90 seconds while they are deciding what to order, if you want to groove to the music for 5...maybe 10 seconds, fine...but I'm hungover as fuck dude, quit dancing and order your gay salad with raspberry vinagarette and granola all over it. if I had any wish in the world at that very second I would have not wished for a million dollars or world peace, I would have wished for a hammer to instantly appear in my hand so I could hit him in the side of the knee as hard as possible so he would stop dancing and scream so loud that I wouldn't have to listen to the loud reggae music anymore either.  I order an egg and cheese sandwich with bacon and an orange juice.  Orange juice arrives at my table first. It was basically sunny delight orange juice. This establishment has the hippy tree hugger organic feel to it and you idiots can't make fresh squeezed orange juice? The sandwich comes a full 8-10 minutes after I order it. It was small had a small egg not that much bacon at all, whatever on the cheese, and sourdough bread. This all cost me 10 bucks. Place is a fucking rip-off. If you had brought me my simple order in less than 24 seconds (not 10 minutes) and had fresh squeezed orange juice (not 3 bucks for sunny delight). Then ok charge me 10 bucks and I'll be moderately happy, and would maybe return to eat there if I was 2 mins away from dying of starvation and happened to be driving by.  Then some guy walks in who I guess was the assistant coach of the ASU basketball team or something and one of the tree hugging hippy waaay too exuberant employees starts yelling "clap everyone its so and so from wherever...." and then made some joke like "go UofA" or something to mock him sarcastically. Shut up you dumb shit, I'm trying to consume your shitty 10 dollar egg sandwich in peace. Go smoke a bong in the back of the restaurant like you probably usually do anyway, or go stand in front of your restaurant with a sign saying you want it legalized so I can run you over on my way out. Then I leave and I'm walking to my car and reggae dancing douchebag from earlier is feeding his girlfriend from his fork on the outside patio. Ugh. Everything about this place made my head want to explode.  And all you people who give this place 5 stars should be immediately transferred to the island of molokai like they did with all the people who had leprosy decades ago. Except the new colony will be for morons.

I can't say enough about Studio Mixx, It is truly an amazing workout experience. I had always been interested in doing pilates and yoga but since I feel like I need to do cardio, I never signed up for a yoga/pilates class.  So when I was about to startup running again after not running for 3-4 months and gaining 20-25 pounds, my hairstylist gave me a free weeks pass to Studio Mixx where she works out, and since she said it is pilates, Yoga, AND cardio I had to try it out since I know the benefits of yoga/pilates.  5 stars all the way. The 4 different classes all challenge you immensely and Shandi the owner knows exactly what she is doing and how to change things up in all the classes to keep your muscles guessing, and the cardio is intense as well. Being able to incorporate Yoga and pilates with cardio in a one hour class has been so rewarding for me and am so happy I can work so much of my body in such a short time period. I used to run 3-5 miles 5-6 days a week when I was in shape before, and I still make it out for runs like once a week and after running for 30-60 mins I barely break a sweat and feel pretty unsatisfied now that I am a regular at Studio Mixx. And running for 30-60 mins is pretty intense in its own right.  There are a lot of regulars, but there are also a lot of people who come to try it out and never see again because it is a tough workout. Once you make it through the first week or two, you will become addicted to coming and won't seem quite as tough, but it still will be. And you will see great results, guaranteed.

Never have I encountered such a stupid arrogant wait staff in my life. Totally turned me off and I will never go back. And this is coming from a reviewer who NEVER cares about the service as long as the food is good or even if the food isn't that good, and I tend to get annoyed at reviewers who place such importance on service  I've been here twice. Both times I got take out. FIrst time, I sat down at the bar to have a beer before ordering my takeout order. The dude working the bar was chatting away for a solid 5-6 minutes with 3 or 4 other guests at the bar. He looked like he was a general manager and there was another guy behind the bar literally slaving to make like 10 other drinks, so I don't blame him. So why can't this general manager looking dude get me a drink? He looked at me twice, and after a couple minutes I was just waiting to see how long it would take for him to ask me what I wanted, because I certainly didn't want to interrupt his conversation, and thought it was a joke. He never asked me. And then the guy who was slaving away, finally got to my drink order. Then of course once I finished my beer the dude who ignored me asked me if I needed another beer. No thanks broski, I'm good.  Second time I went in was tonite. Some cute girl was working behind the bar and she was definitely the type of person who is doing YOU a favor by bringing you your drink order. Cut the crap sweetheart. So then she asks me if I wanted a menu as she brings me my beer. I said yes. 30 seconds later some dude comes in at sits near me at the bar and he seemed like a regular because she's like hey how have you been blah blah...and the dude says he's doing good and hungry. So she brings him a menu and starts chatting him up a little as he is asking how some of the apps are. so she finally puts in his order after 4 or 5 minutes. So I'm like, hey, can I get my menu? As she is putting in his order. And again she has a slight look of disgust that I interrupted her from putting in his order and that she was doing me a favor again.   I then get my takeout order and I'm ready to go. So I ask for some extra BBQ sauce, because the last takeout order I got only had 2 tiny cups of BBQ sauce in it. Not enough for a sausage, ribs, and pulled pork combo. Then I get home and there is a whopping 1 extra small cup of BBQ sauce in there. Not to mention zero napkins and zero silverware. I mean WTF is this? I spend 47 bucks on a combo order, 2 sides. (granted I had a salad at the bar and a beer) And they can't even give me more then a half an ounce of extra BBQ sauce and no napkins or silverware??? Is this place actually a business with breathing human beings inside???   The food is actually pretty solid, which is why I went back a 2nd time. But the portions are not worth the money at ALL. I'm still hungry right now and I had a combo order brisket, pulled pork, sausage and 2 extra sides. How is that possible? Their sides are 4.99 each...4.99 for a side of fries??? I mean...they must have been 50/50 on either starting this restaurant or robbing a bank before starting the restaurant..."Let's scrap robbing a bank guys, much easier to charge 4.99 for fries and not have to worry about going to prison" This place is an absolute ripoff. The Mac and Cheese is good and worth the 4.99 if it were the year 2020 right now. The sausage is REALLY good. But is SO small. I would have to eat literally 19 pieces of the sausage to be satisfied if I was just eating that.  I realize this is a long review. I'm not a nitpicker or a complainer, maybe I'm just having an off day. But these people working here totally rubbed me the wrong way    with their lack service, attention to detail, and medium to small portions for the high prices you pay. I would pay money to eat at a homeless shelter where the food is free before giving this place a cent of my money again.

This place is very good!  I stumbled across this place when driving down Hayden today and decided to drop in and give it a try. There were a lot of really nice sounding options on the menu ranging from Burgers to hot dogs to burritos with lots of tasty sounding toppings on each.  I opted for the Arizona burger and the Sonoran Hot dog. The Arizona burger had a homemade green chili beef in it which was VERY good and the Sonoran Dog was surprisingly really good. I say surprisingly because I am used to El Guero Canelo down in Tucson which has the best Sonoran dogs and did not think I would come away satisfied because of going to that place in Tucson a lot. The Sonoran dog here measured up well and was very tasty.  While i was waiting Vanessa the owner came up to my table and introduced herself and told me about the place. She was very nice and accomadating and made me feel welcome. You could tell her and her husband take a lot of pride in their restaurant. Everything was really nice and clean and the staff was also very helpful.  I will definitely go back to this place, Great spot. And great food!
