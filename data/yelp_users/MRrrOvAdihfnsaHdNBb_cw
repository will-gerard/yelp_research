The name "Dick's Hideaway" is an understatement! This is as hidden as a restaurant can get. Hole in the wall? Yes!   I was Yelping around on Saturday morning looking for somewhere to eat in AZ that wasn't a chain. Challenging task, I know. I needed something that reminded me of home. Something with character and culture. This is when my prayers were answered and I stumbled upon rave reviews of this adequately named establishment. Chile Adovada on their brunch menu? Surely I wasn't in Scottsdale anymore... this sounded like heaven to me! I could hardly contain my excitement when we finally entered this humble abode of brunch delight! At last- I found a joint that didn't resemble a Denny's or Ihop. I was delighted to say the very least. My boyfriend had the breakfast burrito and I of course had to get the Chile Adovada. It was pure bliss. The plate was large enough to feed 2 but I was starving. Every bite was out of this world! I could talk about the food for hours but let me move on to the ambiance. It was about as cool as the food. I felt like I was part of a club or something of that nature. There are no signs on the door advertising the place so it felt a little secretive. Pretty cool huh! The staff was super friendly and inviting. I topped off my weekend brunch with a small glass of jalapeno infused tequila. Careful if you don't like spicy flavors! If you like heat as much I do though, you will love it!  I will definitely be back at Dick's again soon!  Ciao!

First time at D'Lish and I was quite D'ssapointed. I ordered (to-go) the quinoa bowl that comes with veggies and it came out soup style...which then exploded in my paper bag on the drive back to work. I ordered mine without cheese expecting the bowl to then be a vegan dish but it appeared to be full of cream! Ew! Why would I bother to ask them when ordering if their "quinoa veggie bowl" has cream in it? SO weird. I also ordered an iced green tea with some lemonade mixed in and it came out pink and tasting like sugar water. Ummmmm.... when does green tea look pink... This place is a nice concept but it's overpriced and lacks vegan options and I won't be going back for food. I do want to try their coffee so I'll be back to see how that goes. All in all, D'Lish left a lot to be D'sired in my opinion.

Amazing service. I love the drive thru option- they even put your clothes in your car. 4 business shirts were only $10 to be dry cleaned. Next day service and it's organic? What's not to love?

Delicious coffee and the owner is very sweet and friendly! She makes the best chai lattes. Also, they have almond milk which is my favorite. Most coffee shops only have soy as a non- dairy option so having almond milk is a huge plus in my book!

Glorified Denny's is all this place is. This place used to be good but their food quality seems to have diminished. The portobello sandwich should be the spinach mayo sandwich on day old bread. Spinach and mayo being the cheapest ingredients, they def overload it and then skimp on the mushroom & artichoke. Won't be going back for anything except maybe coffee.

Loud!! I can't hear myself think. The music was unnecessarily loud both times I went here. Bring your earplugs and it might be tolerable. Really loud karaoke sounding band on Wednesday night... So fun!

Love when I order the raw veggie salad and it says it comes with avocado yet they never put the avocado in there..... standard. Basically the entire salad consists of lettucs and very few other veggies scattered throughout. Why would I pay $7 for a bowl of lettuce. This place needs to really step it up- their service is pretty awful. If you have 15 people in line.. shouldn't you have 2 registers open with people taking orders? Ridiculous. They get my order wrong more often than not. I don't know why I keep giving 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, chances. Hoping for a change.. not going to see one anytime soon probably.
