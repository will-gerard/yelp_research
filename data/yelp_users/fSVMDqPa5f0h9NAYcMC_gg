We were sent there by our builder to pick out the granite for our counter tops.  It was our first time doing this, but I know good service and the staff didn't disappoint.  I really appreciated the feedback and help.

Delicious!  Got the surf'n'turf,  steak was cooked right, lobster tail was perfect.  Staff was great too.  Had a 45 minute wait, but they will text you when your table is ready, so we went and did some shopping nearby.  Can't wait to go back!

I've been here a few times and placed orders to go as well.  I love the Crab cake sandwich!  That's i got again this past weekend. :)  My wife got herself some turkey sandwich, but made the mistake of sending me to go pick up the order and bring it home....  Unfortunately,(mostly for me), The Deli gave me the wrong order.  It's easy to see why, my sandwich was in there and it was right.  I had no idea what she got, so i just took the order home.  Yes, My wife was upset!!  She promptly called them right up and expressed her frustration, and they fixed the situation to her satisfaction.  And of course, she got my sandwich and I ate the misfit sandwich.  Can't say that I would order it again....  But at least she was happy. :)  Good job on making things right for us!!!

1st time for everything!  Chips, salsa, bean dip are great.  Sadly....this is the only place I've ever been to that will charge extra for a measly basket of chips.  So here we are with leftover salsa and dip waiting for our food to come out.  Had to convince my wife not to walk out.  This place could do better and at least fall in line with every other Mexican restaurant and keep the chips coming while they cook our food.

Rudy's is great since I'm from Texas and miss it.  I ate there today, ordered the lean brisket and they gave me the cutter's choice.  Staff still have some learning to do.  But this place can easily be the top in the Valley.  Poultry is the best.  Brisket is okay.

Finally! No more hunting down a waffle trucks.  Here you get to make them the way you want, and have some frozen yogurt too!  Great place for the whole family.

Favorites are: Philly cheese stake sub, cajun breadsticks, burger, loaded fries, pizza.  Taste and price keep me coming back.  Great friendly staff as well.

Really looked forward to trying this place out.  Unfortunately didn't get to try the food, or even a drink!  15 minutes at our table and not even an acknowledgement from a waitress or waiter.  I'd be willing to let it slide, had they even seemed busy.  Having a toddler and a pregnant wife with me would give the staff some urgency.... You'd think.

Food is great!  They have a Sasparilla for a beverage choice.  Burritos are very wet, but yummy.  Brisket is exceptional.  Looking forward to trying the pulled pork.  Prepare to eat outside.  I prefer to take it home.
