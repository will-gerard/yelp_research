Walked in the door and greeting was very rude. Then when the lady saw I had a service dog she refused to seat us. I try to explain the Americans Disability Act and she suddenly couldn't speak English anymore.

Brief: Service animal rejected! Literally yelled at us to get out cuz we had legal service dog with us. That's just wrong! They gonna reject me cuz I'm too dark next? Or cuz my friend is a Lesbian? Service including cook extremely rude Food was mediocre at best. Maybe 2 or 3 stars max for food if I ignore the rude service.  Review: I was so excited to find a place near by where I could get biscuits and gravy. I placed our order with a young woman on the phone who was nice enough. I was so excited to be getting breakfast here, but there was no one in line when I got there. I thought it was odd at breakfast rush there were about 5 construction workers seated but otherwise empty.  I went to pay for my order and the lady was immediately rude. I thought maybe it was in my head, so I smiled and I asked if I could add a side of bacon to which she huffed and threw her hands on the counter as if I had told her that someone in the parking lot hit her car. A little over the top, much? Charged me $4 for 4 strips of under cooked bacon. Eggs were overcooked. Hash browns were raw inside burnt outside. Gravy wasn't bad. Biscuit was standard Pillsbury or something so it was ok. A hair fell off my shirt and onto the service counter and the last yelled at us that the service dog had to get out. Whether the dog was inside the shop or on the car, the hair was already on my shirt. Then the cook came over and started yelling at me for putting the dog on the counter. At no time was the dog ever in contact with any counter. Then the owner started in who is married to the horrible woman behind the register. I said just give us our food and we'll go and the last continued yelling. Finally we got our food and the owner said, "Now get out!" And put his tiny little hand on me as if he were going to escort us out but realizing he couldn't move me he ran ahead to the front door making a "shooing" motion. The food pretty much sucked, especially for how expensive it was. On top of everything else, I think they may have even over charged us. Just don't do it. Food isn't worth it and don't help hateful people succeed. Isn't there enough of that in the world?

I love Max! Max is the dog. The people that work there are pretty great, too! Excellent, fast, efficient service, amazing customer care, knowledgeable, helpful, kind, courteous, these people earn their 5 stars and then some. This business shines. Any business owner could learn something from this guy. I am a customer for life.  I have a 96 Toyota Tacoma with 280,000+ miles on it that no one is allowed to touch but them. And with their help I might get another 200,000 or so miles on it. I am also about to buy a new car and it will never see the shadow of another garage. They are becoming more than just the mechanics that work on my vehicles. They are friends in the neighborhood. They can be your friends too.
