Huge thanks to all the cool people over at the Hi-Liter for an awesome time during my best friends bachelor party!!! We had a large group and the staff at the Hi-Liter treated us right from start to finish!

As a veteran of the strip club scene and former dancer at Heartbreakers, now Bombshells, I'm sending out a big "Shame on you!" to the management at Bombshells! We rented a party bus for my best friends bachelor party and were told Bombshells was one of the clubs on the V.I.P. list. I called the club to alert of our arrival time to make sure we could get in. The person I spoke to was quite rude over the phone, but said they make decisions regarding admittance on a case by case basis. I told him we were a large group, would buy drinks, and as a former dancer, all my friends are schooled to pay the dancers well! When we got there, we were met at the door and told we would have to pay full cover and that they wouldn't do anything special for our bachelor. Lucky for us, our driver got a tip to go the the Hi-Liter, which turned out the be the best ever!! So, again, shame on you Bombshells! And to the girls who missed out on lots of money that night... go work at a real club! Peace

Here it is.. they get four stars because I love their breakfast burritos and because they are the closest place to my house to get fuel in a pinch, but you will pay a premium and may have to wait for a local farmer to get his tractor out of the way to get to the pump. Not the cleanest feeling place in the world for sure, but I do like that its family owned and they always seem to remember me. QC is still considered far away, but we have the small town feel going for us, which to me is super cool, and this place is an example of that!

We have been eating at Don Pedros for over a year and just love it. The place is never empty and its not because there is nothing else to eat in Queen Creek. If your looking for the "Garcias" type Mexican food, there are two other places in Queen Creek for that! But if you like real Mexican food, Don Pedros is for you! Even though busy, we have never had to wait long to be seated and the service is always great. The owner always walks around to the tables to make sure everything is to your liking! And, I likey!!! YUM  They also have Poker and Karaoke on Saturdays! Very fun!

I swear I hear angels sing as I walk through the doors, as if I have arrived in my own personal heaven. Who doesn't love wall to wall libations and pretty much anything you would need to throw a BA house party! All the alcohol and mixers you could want, snacks, glass wear, and even little umbrellas! I just love this place and am so glad we have our very own here in QC!
