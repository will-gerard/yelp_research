Never go to Just Brakes. Such bait and switch people. Ask them who comes in and gets a $99 brake job. Almost no one.

I too have had a nightmare experience with another Fletcher tire in Chandler. They broke something on my car, said they don't have the know how to fix it, and then made a bunch of dumb excuses as to why it wasn't their fault. The excuses they used made it obvious that they don't have the slightest clue about how a car works mechanically. Talking to their management does nothing.   I highly reccomend that you find somewhere else to go.  The company is a shambles from the top down.

Ok, so it's Panda Express, just like every other Panda, but without the express part. I have never come here and not waited for them to have to make food. Forget about eating here is there is more than a couple of people in front of you.

IKEA is what happens when you take Walmart, remove the customer service, and then blend in needless complexity and a treasure hunt.  The fact that they herd the sheep through their maze like its a museum to the future of bad euro dorm rooms.  And seriously, people are posting about their Swedish meatballs??  I always loved the Muppets growing up but now find myself wanting to punch the Swedish chef is his stupid face.   The nice thing is at least the check out lines are long.   If you want to ask them to perform their Easter parts hunt for you, it's $40. Believe me, this is cheap as the people who work there are as annoyed as the rest of us.   I saw a nice little family walk off down the aisle to get all the parts to their cheap hobby shop furniture, and could only pray for them not needing counseling when their journey comes to an end.   Upon leaving the store, I had a renewed faith that we live in the greatest country in the world. A country where stores take care of you and don't have you sign all their responsibility and culpability for errors away.  Stores, where if you want one thing, they don't force you through the corn maze of zombies walking aimlessly around.   "Is this our socialized utopian future?" I wonder to myself. Are the pre-agreed uniforms that all alien cultures wear in sci-fi movies coming to us?  Will we be herded through stores to revel in their wares wearing our Apple like garb set by Steve Jobs?  I say no to all this. Lots of stores sell build it yourself furniture without the passive aggressive way of saving the public money.   If you doubt my words, simply go to Ikea and buy something. I highly suggest either cocktails or a good benzodiazepine or even better, a mix of both.

Seriously, these guys make an awesome Gyro sandwich! If you ever go to the so called Greek places, and they put lettuce on their Gyron, run screaming. Excellent Kronos gyro meat and perfect tsatziki on a fresh warm pita, the god's will have to ask you..."you lika da juice?"

Came here on a recomendation. Food isn't bad unless you are expecting authentic Cajun food. Jambalaya had a layer of oil floating, the fried catfish was overcooked and thin.  Overall disappointing.  Reminds me a little of the tryouts on American Idol where the people think they can sing but they can't.   Don't get me wrong, the food is ok, but this is hardly fresh and authentic.

This place is run horribly. It was out of cheddar and steak for Philly sandwiches.

Best burrito shop in the area. Amazing breakfast burritos and an awesome shrimp burrito.  I have yet to have something bad here ever.

Really cool little restaurant with a great vibe. Amazing wine list by a world class sommelier.  Every food item is thoughtfully planned prepared. I recommend this place!
