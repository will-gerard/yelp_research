I love mexican food and I would want mexican food for lunch everyday if I can.   Now you can guess how excited I was when I found out that I had mexican restaurant right next where I work.    But sadly enough this Macayo's mexican kitchen was not a real mexican restaurant. They make McDonald version of Mexican food.  I can tell that they use low quality meat, chiken etc.  I am so sad that have to drive at least 5 minutes to get real mexican food.

This is really neat restaurant ! They have all different kind of teriyaki menu. It looks like they prepare meal really clean. My favorite is Yaki soba it is noodle with teriyaki with different meat but the noodle is always cooked just right ! I like that

My vietnamese friends said it is the best vietnamese restuarant. But maybe because I am not vietnamese I couldn't tell big difference. It was good food tho.

WOW! WOW! FANTASTIC! I have lived in Glendale 2 years, and I am so sad that I have not known this place earlier.   They make really great side dishes, and they only carry good quality products.  I cannot say enough how good they are.   And I really like rice cakes and I counldn't find good quality rice cakes for 2 years.  But they have it.   So HAPPY !!! 5 X 5 Stars !!!!

I went this restaurant after reading from Yelp even tho it is kind of far from me.  The food was good, but what I like more about this place was the atmosphere.  It made me feel like I am in Vietnam. I liked that. Honestly I am not sure about the taste. I didn't feel really special but I liked it because I like Vietnamese food anyway!

I am surprised that they have good reviews.  I would say this was my least favorite chinese restuarant in town.  I am trying to think postiviely after reading some of 5 star reviews, but  I cannot forget how orange chiken tasted like a sugar chiken.  I almost thought I was eating a dessert.   I don't mind modern, dark, quiet atmosphere as long as the chinese food tastes like chinese food.

I really like this place !!! The taste is good but I like people there. The servers look like they are brothers but all are very quiet but kind and don't bother you with over kindness. And their boba tea is the best in town !!!!

I can't believe Helen Magic Hair has no positive reviews. This is one of the best hair shop and really popular .  If there is one thing I can complain about this place is that sometimes there are too many people, so I need to wait. So I try to go when others cannot go.  I think everyone has their own style,, so hard to evaluate hair stylist with subjective opinion.  Here are what I really like about this place.  First she is very very kind, even when she must be tired she never loses her smile and really treat her customers with good manner. As a person who is running a business I really respect that and I try to learn from her.  Second, she is very honest and fair, when you just need to trim your hair she charges accordingly, not like flat rate.  Third, she is very fast, once she found out what I want, she does her job with really smart moves.   I think this is really great shop
