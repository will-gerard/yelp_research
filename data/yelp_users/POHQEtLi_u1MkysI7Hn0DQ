Desert Jade is great. The decor is a bit funky -- reminds me of something Scottish, but the food is some of the best I've had in Phoenix, as far as Chinese goes. I've never had a bad meal here and take friends here. I think it's great. I wish it were open on Sundays. That's a bit of a bummer.  They have great almond cookies. We usually get moo Shu chicken, which is very flavorful. I have also had them be very accommodating and make me steamed foods with brown rice. I just love this place!

ETA: Bobby has moved to Moments Salon off Camelback. I'm still seeing him all these years later, and adore the cuts he gives. Love, love him. :)    I like to give a cut a few days before I pass full judgment...  AND  I AM IN LOVE WITH MY HAIR!!!!!!!!!   I was needing and wanting a change from my other stylist who'd just look at  me and want me to tell her what to do. Um, isn't *she* the professional? I digress...  Anyway, I turned to my Yelpers, and you did good by me. I went to Bobby and am very, very, very happy with my hair. In fact, now several people want his card and to go see him.  He was the perfect combination of listening to what I want and am willing to do with my hair and making suggestions of what will best suit me.  Well, Yelpers... I've now got a cut that is LITERALLY wash and go. OMG. A girl could not be more pleased! He spent time talking me through how to get my curls to look good (not frizzy and uggh lookin'). He was very easy to talk to and there were no weird, uncomfortable silences, kwim?  I concur with the neck and scalp massage. Ahhhhhhh...  One thing that really irritates me about some other salons is when they say nasty things about how your hair was cut last time and/or when they make you feel like you are an ugly piece of crap without them. We've all heard it before. "Wow, they really cut this uneven last time..blah, blah, blah" Nothing could be further from the reality with Bobby. He was a delight and was very professional.  Boy, I'm glad I booked my next appointment with him NOW. I think he's going to get even more busy with all of these Yelpers lovin' him.   The man does some good work. I love this hair. In fact, I think this is the first time in the 30-some odd years I've been dealing with this head-o-hair that I truly love and appreciate the fact that I have natural curls. I'll have to upload a new pix with them later. He did a great blow out job on the hair, too.  Thanks, Yelpers! I'm a happy, happy girl!  **Disclaimer: I give Bobby -- himself -- 5 stars all the way!! The salon itself was good

Dr. Grant and his staff are amazing. I wouldn't trust my kitty to anybody else. They are very caring and through. I also appreciate the fact that Dr. Grant will email you with any questions or concerns you might have about procedures, food, etc.  If they had a "Mayo Clinic" for cats -- this would be the place!  Excellent, excellent, excellent!

This was very enjoyable and probably better than most Indian food I've had in Phoenix. We had dinner here.   Naan was good Pathara was also good Tandoori chicken was good and well priced Sag Shrimp also good  The chutnies were very nice. I liked the mango one best, and the mint and tomato were also very good.  All in all, I very much liked this. They were very nice and attentive to keeping our drinks refilled and refreshed.

Delux is overrated. I've had a better burger at Red Robin. Seriously, Fez has better Fez Burgers and Sweet Potato fries.  I won't be back here. It's just overrated and frankly boring.  My mom's burgers are better than this place.

This was just OK. The service was decent, but my hot and sour soup was cold. Our Moo Shu Chicken was not that flavorful and just OK. I've had better steamed dumplings from Trader Joe's. Desert Jade in Central Phoenix is much better and less expensive. I felt this was very expensive for what you got. The inside was pretty and the service was nice, but I've had better food elsewhere. Just bleh, IMHO.

I like Pita Jungle. I like it a lot.  Yes, the portions are mongo, but you never leave wishing you had more.  I love that I can go here and still be healthy while eating out. The last two times I went I got the Grilled Vegetable Salad, which was tasty but I felt it was a tad on the oily side. Today I got a summer special -- the Mediterranean Salad, which had chicken, romaine, tomatoes, roasted red peppers, golden raisins, red onion, corn, cilantro and a lemon dressing. It was wonderful! I thought the raisins and corn were odd at first, but I really did enjoy it. And being that it was coming on 2:30 and I hadn't eaten much all day, I snarfed the whole thing down like a little piglet. But it was all good, healthy stuff, so I'm not feeling bad. :)  The downsides to this place are that it can be a little "crunch-a-fied," but hey, I lived in Boulder, Colo., for a number of years and so I tend to like that "granola" way. The only thing I sometimes see is that the service can be a tiny bit slow, but that could also be because it's generally hopping when I am there. The last two times I went the service was good.  I'd love to see them offer whole-wheat pasta. That would be a dream come true.  Good food, "crunchy" atmosphere (which I like), well priced and healthy, wholesome stuff.  Mmmm. I could go for some of that hummus right about now!  The servers seem to have a lot of those ear stretch things, which I don't get. Maybe it's part of the crunch-a-fied uniform. Ha ha. They can keep the ear things, just keep the healthy stuff comin'...

Ugh. Well, I should add this disclaimer first: I've never really had muchmMexican food in Arizona that I like. Am I crazy, you ask? No. I am a Colorado girl, who likes Colorado and New Mexican-style Mexican food.  This place is greasy. I've had better at other places. They were nice, but I feel like I need an oil change now.   We will not go back.  I even just brushed my teeth to try and get the taste out of my mouth. Pepto could be in my future.  I have friends who like this place a lot, but they also like their food a lot more greasy than I do.  This is a good place if you like grease.  *shudder*

This place is excellent! I had the multi-grain pancakes and shared a side of corned beef hash. Man, you never see corned-beef hash these days.  It's great! The lines are long and deep with lots of S'dale peeps, but if you can stand that -- it's worth the wait. I also love that they have sugar-free syrup on the tables.

I'm just not feeling the Sabuddy love. This was the second trip we made there. I tried it again tonight thinking maybe I wasn't fair last time -- maybe a year ago?  First off, it was FREEZING in the restaurant, and I had on jeans. I was shivering. Literally shivering.  The hummus had a strange consistency that made it stick to the back of my throat, and now my throat hurts like something gross is stuck. The pita was ok, but it didn't seem much better than what you get at the grocery store. I've had better.  I got the chicken shawarma plate. Eh. The chicken was too salty, not very warm and tasted odd. Perhaps it was old? I still can't get the salt out of my system. I think I need to go down a gallon of water. The salad on the plate was sort of pathetic.  My dining partner got the chicken pita sandwich. She was complaining that her stomach was burning after eating it. WTH?  The staff was nice, however the wait was purgatory. I thought I was going to freeze to death waiting for the check (which we had to ask for and then wait after asking).  I've had my fair share of Israeli food and various other sorts of Middle Eastern food. This was fair at best.   I'm not sure why everybody raves about the hummus. (Christine does her best Simon Cowell Impression) If I'm being honest with you, the hummus at Fresh & Easy is a lot better.  Eh. *shrug* Not feeling the love. Sabuddy is not my buddy.

I love the Loco. I really do. We come here several times a month. It's so yummy.   The chicken is always hot, and it's so tasty. I swear I could swim in the green salsa. It's sooooooo good.  The chicken is very flavorful and you always see it cooking on the back grill. It's not "cheap" fast food, but you get what you pay for. It's moderate in price, but I think it's well worth it.   The churros (2 for 99 cents) are like sticks of heaven.  I'm loca for the Loco. :)

We went to this location, and it was awful. -Food was cold. -Service was terrible. -Our server even forced me to put my leftovers in a box with my hands.  It was so bad I sent a note to PF Chang's corporate. They followed up with an email, basically saying they were sorry. They even had the store manager call me. You know what he did? He said he was sorry. Are you kidding me? I'd at least expect a GC to come back. Nope. I'll never go back. It's overpriced crap. At least at Pei Wei it's cheaper and you get your food hot.  Here's my letter to corporate: Hello, I'm writing in regard to the dinner we just had at your Happy Valley location. I'm extremely sorry to say it was very disappointing. When we arrived at our table there were used napkins under the table, and the wrapped silverware I was supposed to use was on the seat of the booth. I asked for a different napkin roll (who wants to use a napkin on your face where people have sat?), so the server gave me one from a different table where he placed the one I didn't want. The food was ok. It tasted ok, but it was not very warm at all. I ordered the mu shu chicken, which I asked for the server to wrap in the crepes me. I understand they are not the most simple to wrap, but by the time they got done with them they looked pretty unappetizing. They were ripped and pretty rough looking. I would have told the server or anybody that our food wasn't very hot, but nobody ever came back to the table to ask us how everything was. I also was only drinking water because I'm pregnant and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. It would have been nice to have been offered more water at some point. It's disappointing to me, because we only try to eat out once a week lately to help save money. We thought we'd treat ourselves to a nice afternoon movie and then a nice dinner out. I selected your restaurant because I thought of it as more mid-upper scale. So, I thought it would be a nice treat for my partner and myself. Nobody ever came back to ask how things were. When I asked the server for to-go boxes he suggested I "take care of it myself." Basically, he'd already cleared everything away, so I had to put the mu shu chicken roll in the box myself with my hands. I felt this was sort of weird and inappropriate. I mean, better my hands than his, but it's not what I'd call a nice dining experience. Our server was just ok, but it did seem like we weren't that important to him - but maybe that's how he feels if you don't order drinks and apps - if he's assuming you aren't going to tip him very well. I always tip at least 20%, if not more, when the service is good. He was lucky to get 15%. He was fair at best. I found all of this very surprising because the restaurant was maybe a third full - so it's not like they were so slammed that things slipped by. The other sad thing is that we spent a good part of our dining conversation talking about where we should have gone for better Chinese food and service. Then when we left my partner kept commenting on how Applebee's, Logan's or Ah-So would have been better. Perhaps it would have. I noticed on my receipt a message saying I could take a survey if I had a code. I had no code or I would have gladly taken the survey with this feedback. I also noticed the staff trying to seat a couple at a booth where two young children had previously been. The booth was messy and had food on the seat, and the older gentleman had to point it out to the server asking her to clean it before he sat down. There were plenty of open tables, yet she was sitting them next to the kitchen at a dirty table. In fact, she was wiping the table as she sat them down - in a restaurant that was a third full! I hope your staff is able to correct some of this obvious issues. During what continues to be tough economic times, I think people are much more selective about their dining-out dollars. I know that's our case. I would be very hesitant to return to any of your locations after this dinner.

This was not good. The scene here was scary at best.   I got fajitas. How do you mess up fajitas? Mama did it.  My dining partner wasn't all that hungry and sort of sick. She got a grilled cheese. How do you mess up grilled cheese? Mama did it.  It's too bad, because downtown Glendale could be cute.  I *wanted* to like it.  Bad. End of story.  ~~~ Update 9/13/08 I probably shouldn't admit this, but we have taken to calling it "Barfy Momma's" around our house. Yes, we are bad.

This was just ok. I got the steakhouse salad, which came with four pieces of meat the size of quarters. I'm sorry, but that's no $13 salad. I had to send it back, because I asked for the meat to be cooked through and it was rare.  My dining partner said her pizza was tasteless.  It was very loud.  In all, it was too much money for what we got. We won't go back.

This service really sucks. And no one should use them. They don't clean your pool and I would not recommend them to anyone.

I went back to this little out of the way place for the lunch special today. I'm hooked!  The food is freshly made to order (even the hot and sour soup) and really quite delish! I also got a sushi roll to try it - very good!   I got the lunch special, and it was a ton of food for $5.95. Their hot and sour soup is some of the best I've had!! I hope people will check this place out. Don't judge a book by its cover.

I'm really happy we found Good Fellas. What a great place tucked away on a little strip mall that doesn't do it justice!  We love Greek/Med foods, so it's nice to find a good one close to home. Good Fellas had very reasonable prices, and the owner was extremely nice. The service was just wonderful, and you can tell the owner really cares about his customers' experience. I'm not sure what the other posters are saying in regard to the prices. I think $7.99 for a chicken kabob wrap, crispy hot fries and a drink is pretty reasonable!  It also appears that they have cheaper lunch specials.  We had hummus to start ($4.99, I believe - also reasonable in my book). It was wonderful and very tasty! The pita that came with it were piping hot, hot, hot! Perfection. I enjoyed the chicken kabob wrap, and my dining partner got the gyro. Both were super yum and cooked perfectly. The owner (Ninos?) offered us the lentil soup and the chicken curry soup for free. They both were steaming hot, and both were very, very good!  Our daughter was dining with us, and Nino even offered to make her a special soup that wasn't as hot. He was super nice.   I like this place a lot more than Chicago Gyros, which I think is pretty dang good, too. But I give this way more thumbs up for the service, and I also think the food was better.   Our food was great, and all of it was super hot - a big plus in my book. We will be back for sure. I highly recommend it!   I can see myself craving this place.
