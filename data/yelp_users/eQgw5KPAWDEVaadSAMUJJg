I always go on Mondays and Tuesdays after 8 for their bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20. Its to die for and a good deal! My favorite bruschetta is the roasted peppers with goat cheese. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! YUM

Oysters are to die for! We got half a dozen and loved them so much, we got another! Also, their yellowtail is so good! Their wine list is so large and has my favorite on there. I cannot wait to go again!

I went for happy hour in the bar and it was great! It was so busy, but the server was able to still be really nice and get us everything we needed. We had the chicken egg rolls on the happy hour and they were so good! We also got the banana cream pie, it was so amazing! It melted in your mouth! I cannot wait to go back!

More of a bar than anything. I think their food is way too greasy and when I go in there, something is always sticky. That's pretty gross..

I really like this place! There salads are awesome and huge! I love their BBQ sliders too! They are so yummy! I usually do take out and they are so kind, because I always call 15 minutes til the kitchen closes. I always look forward to eating here!

This Paradise Bakery makes all the others look awful! The people that work there do not even care when customers are around and will just say inappropriate things, its okay with me, BUT NOT IN FRONT OF CHILDREN! I was very offended and they weren't even my kids! This was honestly the last strike!   The second strike was a HAIR in my fruit salad. I mean, that is just gross and made me wonder why everyone behind the counter weren't wearing hair nets.   The first strike is they are always out of something or another like edamame! That is what makes the Asian salad! No point in getting it.   Its a shame that this Paradise Bakery is so awful because it is the closest one to my house! Guess I will have to drive all the way to Scottsdale and 101 if I want Paradise.

The sushi is okay, but their steak is so good. I love their fried rice. Weird decor... They should really work on that!

I went back to this place after work to give this place another chance. I had the bruschetta and it was very yummy. Happy hour is pretty good here, but I am still upset about them not having wine! I also haven't tried their pizza since the first time so that is why I only gave it 4 stars. Also, service it good and they are very personable.

The best cupcake I've ever had! You cannot go wrong with what you order. I love the glitter they use. I currently live in California and I can't find anything like this. Sprinkles is nothing compared to this place!

I have been a member of Mountainside for a little over a year now. I love the location! Its halfway between my house and work, which is perfect for me! I also love how all the cardio equipment has a TV on it! It makes the pain and little less! I feel like they are really clean and everything is up-to-date!  The down side is that they are really expensive. I wish they had a pool to make everything worth while! I also wish they would leave the towels in the bathroom. Its a pain they keep them up front. Why do they even do that anyways? Also, my main concern is the times they have for their classes. I wish they would have a yoga, cycle or fitness class in the afternoon! All they have is from 9-10 to 4-6. Would it really be that hard to have a class twice a week between 12-3??

Never will I go here again! Their service needs a lot of work before I even think about coming back. I also suggest them to fix their menu and be more clear about what they are serving! When I ask for a wine from the Happy Hour menu and you send me two wines to try, I expect them to both be from the HAPPY HOUR menu!!! Then, getting the bill at the end and seeing they charge more than $2 for one coke! It says nothing on the menu about the cokes being $2.25 per one little 8 oz of coke. Usually if its per coke, they give you only a can and don't charge $2.25!! Then when we ask about it when we get the bill, the waitress said "wow". Like we were being rude and she wouldn't even come back to our table. We were just seeing if it was a mistake! I've been in the restaurant business for over 9 years and I would NEVER speak to a customer like that!!!   Honestly, I am surprised they are still open in this recession! I will never go here again. I don't mind paying a little more for good food, great service, and a great atmosphere. When there is none of that, then whats the point of going??  This place cost us $70 plus tip for happy hour for three people PLUS getting the worst service I ever had in my life. What a rip off!!!

Great when you want good food on the go! Love their Greek salad pita with chicken. Two meals under $20 is a bargain these days so I give it a thumbs up!
