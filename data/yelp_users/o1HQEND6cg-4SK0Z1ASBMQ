I saw Oh No! Oh My! play here. And Band of Annuals. And Eternal 42.  Maybe Joy Electric. But I can't be so sure. Once I learned about the "red cup rule" (booze can be brought in as long as it's in a plastic red cup), all of my experiences at Modified became one long haze of noise and staring intently at paintings and going "I see...yes...very interesting."  The Modified was like the "seedy bar/club" cliche in every movie you ever saw. You couldn't get within ten feet of the building without being pwned in the face with the scent of B.O. and pot. There are homeless people on the patio, lushes on the sidewalk, and a very disinterested door guy who doesn't even look up from his book to stamp your hand with some socio-political metaphor.  Amidst all the decay and broken glass there was (and still is, why the fuck do I keep switching tenses?) something really special.   The bands that came (come) aren't always the biggest and most well known. Because if they were, they'd be playing the Marquee.  But the shows are always worth watching. Even if the bands suck (and trust me, a lot of them do), the energy exchange between them and the crowd is intense.   I've seen people go entire shows clapping in rhythm with the songs. I've seen people cry. I've even people engage in group hugs and collapse to the ground.  ...indie kids.  Unlike other venues, people came to the Modified to be seen (or it is scene? Get it? Fuck you).  You never learned their names, but you could spot them in a crowd. Girl with Crazy Hair. Boy Who Wore A Little Too Much Makeup For It To Be "Ironic". Girl That Always Smelled Really Good. Guy Who Always Wanted To Help The Band Move Their Gear.  I often wonder what my "scenester" nickname would be...  Yes, it's dirty. Yes it's cramped. And yes, if you try to pee near the dumpster the guy who owns the restaurant next door will yell at you in Chinese.  But after all of Phoenix is gentrified into submission, and all the art galleries and performance venues are bulldozed over to make way for more strip malls and high-end shopping outlets (with the occasional Starbucks dotted in to "give it culture"), we will have wished we had visited it more often.  Oh well. Maybe the Phoenix Art Museum will put in a performance venue.  "Hello Phoenix! I want to hear all of you singing along on this one! Even you, guy pretending to make sense of that Monet. Alright, let's go!"

I want to hate you, Pane Bianco. I really really want to hate you. With every fabulous fiber in my being.  You have weird hours, an overwhelming "not quite industrial, not quite rustic" decor, and your $8 Mozzarella, Tomato and Basil salad consists of a cut up tomato and a few, uh, "slugs" of mozzarella topped with soggy basil leaves.   But the real reason I want to hate you is that you duped me. You bamboozled, shanghaied and probably even Kansas City Shuffled me too.  You lured me into this false sense of disappointment with my tiny salad and loaf of bread rolled up in a piece of paper.  You watched me eat it too, didn't you?  You saw me take a big chunk out of one of those cheese slugs. You watched me enjoying that salad. That delicious, gooey salad.  And you liked it, didn't you? You liked watching me scarf down that salad like it was an item from a value menu. You got a sick kick out of seeing me tear through that bread like I'd never had it so good.   You bastard.  I want to hate you. I want to give you two stars and rant and rave about how you teh lame.  But I can't. I just can't.   That salad was just, like, whoa. That had to be the freshest mozzarella and the freshest tomatoes I'd ever tasted.  It made olive garden salad taste like bagged lettuce doused in olive oil.  And if Subway made bread as fresh as yours, I would stop going in there periodically to order the seafood sensation (toasted!) just to watch the employees and other patrons moan and cringe.   I want to hate you. But that bait and switch, luring me in with that "too cool for you" vibe and then hitting me up with some flava, that takes skill. That takes cunning.  And as a woman who spent her youth tying bedsheets around her neck and trying to burn the neighbor's house down with her mind, I appreciate cunning.  Four stars for being cunning, and one star for being leaps and bounds of awesome ahead of Lux.   I don't care if it's vegan. It's still a cupcake, you're still a grown up, and eating it while surfing the web on your flashy new laptop does not make you look any less ridiculous.

I had high hopes for The Eggery.   Not because I thought it had potential or was even that hungry.  For me, the notion of an egg-themed restaurant sounded like the result of  insanity. The kind of mad science you see in comic books and Discovery Channel shows about hunting ghosts.   My brain had conceived this idea of an egg-obsessed madman, ceaselessly forging egg-based delights so that he may share his much-too-specific love of eggs with the world.  Unfortunately for me and my imagination, The Eggery is not insane like Bizarro or Dr. Weird.   No, it's a "Kevin Costner movie" kind of crazy.  The menus look like they haven't been changed or updated since the 80's. Which would normally be refreshingly retro, except the 80's weren't necessarily a good decade for eggs. Come to think of it, I don't think eggs and time travel are compatible.   The omelettes look more like accidents than exquisitely prepared dishes.   "You got chopped up ingredients in my eggs!" "You got eggs in my chopped up ingredients!" "...are you thinking what I'm thinking?"  The Eggs Benedict looks like it's mocking you.   "Hahaha, you could've gotten this same dish at Hometown Buffet, and it would've tasted better, too!"  The Eggery has no means of separating their pancakes from their competitors so they just make them bigger.   If you can help it, avoid ordering the sausage.  In fact, if it's not made of eggs, don't bother. They won't make it right.  Your sausage will be overcooked, your hashbrowns will be burnt, and your coffee will taste like they used the toilet water. And the carafe of coffee they give you is usually only half-filled.  And don't bother complaining to the manager. After all, he's probably the genius who assembled this crack team of apathetic, inattentive doppelgangers posing as a wait staff. Dude probably doesn't even know what eggs Benedict is supposed to look like.  Fuck this. I'm going to Denny's.

Went here yesterday to see the drag show with my friend (and fellow transperson) Fenyx.  Cruisin had everything I would ever want out of a bar; seedy atmosphere, cheap drinks, a stage, friendly bartenders, and trannies, crossdressers, and drag queens as far as the eye could see. For a moment I felt how Robert Smith must feel whenever he walks into a Hot Topic, or Hulk Hogan in a bandana wholesaler's.   But alas, like Torrid and Guitar Center, I inevitably showed up the same day as the token asshole employee whose brief interaction with me would ruin my view of this establishment for all time.  While waiting for the show to commence, Fenyx and I went through the back door to take a smoke break, as were a lot of other people. The back door couldn't be shut all the way or it would lock, forcing you to either bang on it until someone heard you over the music or walk around to the other side.   So he and I are just standing around, smoking, talking, making sure nobody shuts the door, and out comes the DJ. He steps out, and before even lighting his cigarette, slams the door behind him.  "Awwww, man, now you've locked us out," we say, playfully.  The DJ stands over Fenyx, eyeballing him as he responds with "Yeah, that's the point. To keep the undesirables out" before walking off with his cigarette.  "What the hell just happened?" I ask. "He thinks we're a straight couple."  I laughed. I searched for a pen. I'd been mistaken for a lot of things in the past, but this was the first time I'd been mistaken as straight. This had to be documented. Fenyx, who is also not straight, was not as amused.  I tried to brush the comment aside and we went back inside, where the DJ proceeded to stare down my amigo and I from across the bar.   I knew at any moment, a confrontation would escalate, and I was forced to choose between leaving early, missing the drag show, or watch the tension rise to eruption. One of these scenarios carried with it the slight risk of me breaking a newly manicured nail, so naturally, I opted we go back to the Bunkhouse and play darts.  I'm sure giving them 1 star for this one incident is petty, but, uh, so is what they did, so it works out, I guess.  Oh well. Torrid and Guitar Center seem to do just fine without my business. I'm sure Cruisin 7th will do just fine.

Going to Midwestern University for treatment is like taking your dog to the vet for a hair cut.  There is a 75 percent chance you will not see a doctor. Instead, you will see a "student doctor", who will poke and prod you too hard, read a bunch of items off of a checklist, and then hurriedly and nervously leave the room to fetch the real doctor when they run out of things to ask you.  After fifteen minutes or so of waiting, the real doctor will come in and sit down with you (while the eager student taking notes or something), briefly explain to you why you're feeling what it is that you're feeling, write some prescription in handwriting not even the pharmacist can read, and then leave you to your fate.  I once went in to have blood work done, as I was experiencing intense mood swings that coincided with constant hunger pangs. Although my test results indicated I had "high liver function" (the kind that you get when you have an alcohol or tylenol problem, which I didn't have), I was given anti-depressants on the sole basis that I had admitted to the doctor that my parents were in the middle of a divorce.   Oh, and as he handed me the prescription of anti-depressants, he mentioned that there was a good chance I would experience night terrors and noticeable weight loss as a result of taking them.  Who the hell gives a drug that will instill weight loss to someone complaining of hunger pangs?  If you must go here, avoid making an appointment on Thursday. It's admittedly their busiest day of the week.  One of their former Board of Directors was just released due to an impending malpractice suit.  And their choice of magazines suck.

Look, let's face it, Maggie Moo. You never even stood a chance.  Your flavors are pedantic and unimaginative, your service is lackluster and disheartening, and your prices defy logic.  It's fucking ice cream, and not even good ice cream. I wouldn't know. Maybe if you took better care maintaining your merchandise, it wouldn't taste so terrible.  Whether the flavor's "too soft" or "too hard" it requires you take the reserve tray out of the freezer and serve some of that to me instead.   So apparently your display case is just that. Display.  Your mix-ins are lame and stale. M&M's and sprinkles? Gee, don't give yourself a fucking aneurysm with all this creativity.   So you really didn't have much going for you already by the time your cashier called me "sir". TWICE.   The second time was my fault though. I tried to intervene and correct her.  "is that all for you, sir?" "Um...it's ma'am, actually. I'm a girl." "Oh. I'm sorry, sir!"  If I hadn't said anything I would've only been offended the one time. Mea culpa.  It's not entirely that girl's fault I'm giving you one star, but it certainly helped convince.  You'd be well informed to know I'm writing a letter. Not to your manager or anything.   But to Coldstone Creamery. Begging them back.  I figure why be with a knock-off of a piece of garbage when I can just be with the real deal, you know.  Ha ha! Who am I kidding.   This one event will probably deter me from ice cream all together.   I'll need to set "Gelato & Frozen Custard" on the "Ice Cream Orientation" box on all my social profiles.

Burrito Bandito looks like a burrito place. It has all the trappings of a Mexican eatery; kitschy art depicting a man in a sombrero, horchata on tap, the sound of sizzling meat in the background.  They even have a menu posted on the wall that tells you all the various burritos it makes.  But Burrito Bandito is not a Mexican eatery.  It's a giant middle finger made of drywall.  Sure, the sign says "Home of the Baby Bandito" but what it really means is "Fuck you, Taco Bell across the parking lot. Fuck you and your blatant mockery of our culture's food. Fuck you and your 99 cent hamburger helper burritos. We will not stand for this assfuckery. We will make real Mexican food. You know, the kind where you have to roll your r's just to pronounce it. We'll serve it in a low key yet reasonably aesthetically pleasing dining room of unsanded wooden tables and metal chairs. And charge our patrons an understandably larger price for our food because it's homemade which is totally opposite of your food."  At first you might be put off.  You'll be saying "Whoa, Burrito Bandito. What's the deal? What's with the 'tude?"  And then you, on the suggestion of someone who knows best, order a plate of baby banditos.  One taste of those perfectly tiny chimichangas smothered in jalapeno cream cheese dip and you'll be in the know, man.  You'll know the score.  And before you know it you're ordering off the menu with reckless abandon.  Fuck you, GI tract, you'll say.  I want Huevos Rancheros with the hottest salsa they have...at 3 in the afternoon.   I want an El Patron burrito with a side order of baby banditos.  Give me the carna asada tacos, and you know what, screw the Mexican rice. Give me a double order of refried beans, baby.   And you better believe I want sour cream in my burrito.  I want the guy in the cubicle next to me to suffer.  And when some jabroni walks in, looks at both BB menu and the "Faty Daddy" menu (that's how insane Burrito Bandito is. It's two restaurants in one. It's got split personalities) and asks aloud "Hmmmm, do I want a burger?"  You'll think to yourself "No, you don't want a fucking burger. If you did you would've gone to McDonald's or Jack in the Box."  And then you'll realize that you said it out loud. But you won't care. He ain't going to start shit.  That El Patron burrito you're eating could choke a donkey. There's no way this candyass is going to mouth off to you when you are so obviously reeking of badassery.  In closing, Burrito Bandito is a loose-cannon burrito shop that doesn't play by the rules.  I'll take "Awesome Campaign Slogan Ideas Not Tried Yet" For 500, Alex.

==Warning: much of this review will contain lingo pertaining to the LGBT community. If you come across a word you aren't familiar with, wikipedia it.==  Ever since Homme gave me the boot, I'd been looking for other LGBT-friendly bars to take my business (and obsession with pool, which I totally suck at).  When my friend Fenyx (a fellow tranny in the "ftm" vein) first suggested going to Bunkhouse, I was admittedly a little anxious. Don't get me wrong; I have no problems being around bears. But gay bars are opened so that people of that orientation can mingle and socialize within it, and I don't like being anybody's unwanted guest.   Bunkhouse is like a living, breathing Outback Steakhouse commercial; "men's men" sit around a fire pit, joking and laughing underneath the gaze of totem poles. The interior is so fabulously "frontier". Multiple big screen TVs play muted cable programs that are ignored by the patrons. It's like a bizarro sports bar. And I know bizarro.  One of the many reasons I prefer LGBT-bars to "straight bars" is that every gay bar I've been to in this city, every drink I order, no matter how obscure and/or hard to memorize, is given to me enthusiastically. Sometimes it's outrageously expensive, especially if I'm not the gender of the bartender's preferred company.   And sometimes I'm given the stink eye when I insist on being given the correct, IBA-sanctioned garnish with my drink. I'm just trying to get the most out of my PBSA education. Don't judge me.  But never once have I been told "you want a what? Are you gay?" (River City) or "yeah, that's not going to happen" (Tiki Lounge). Not even at Homme.   At Bunkhouse I asked for a Colorado Bulldog, and the bartender just nodded and made it happen for me, even though everybody around me all turned their heads and said "what the fuck is that?" And it was delicious. So delicious that I overlooked the fact that it was not served to me in the bucket glass as deemed appropriate by the IBA. I think I officially need help.  I'm sure there were plenty of fun-loving interesting people at Bunkhouse, but I didn't make any attempt to talk to any. I was too busy blowing all my quarters on the pool tables, pinball machines and electronic dart boards. Surprisingly, these attractions were unmanned during my entire visit to Bunkhouse, probably because, as mentioned before, people were too busy like, talking and socially interacting.   Making new friends? Fuck that, they have South Park pinball!  At first I was a little uncomfortable, being the only girl in the bar. But by the end of the night there were other girls, a lesbian couple, and even some drag queens from the show at Cruisin' 7th. And everyone was just as welcome as the bears and leather daddies.   The staff at Bunkhouse was really friendly, in that genuinely swishy way. (Oh noes, another strange and foreign word! I checked, wikipedia has an entry for this one too.) The staff at any bar really set the tone for the behavior of the patrons. The bartender could've given me that "what the fuck are you doing here" look when I came up to order my drink, thus setting off the alert to the patrons that perhaps I didn't belong there and needed to be treated as such.   But they were really nice to me, got me anything I asked, and when the soda gun started pouring out syrup-less soda water, they dumped the glass out into the sink and made me a new drink rather than just passing me the diluted soda water and shrugging. I've had my heart broken by bartenders in the past, but I think Bunkhouse may be able to set me on the path to healing.  On Sundays they have $3 burgers and $1 drafts. And on Thursdays everyone runs around in their underwear, though now that the weather's getting cooler I don't see that happening so much. But I could be wrong.  You know, like I was about Homme and setting my nickname as "Transzilla".  Now I think about it, I'm wrong a lot of the time.  But that won't stop you from taking my suggestions, will it?

All my life I wanted to be able to wear long, dangly earrings.   Seeing as how I spent most of that life as a boy, however, I wasn't ready to realize this dream until, like,  yesterday, when I came into Halo to get my lobes done.  Admittedly, this wasn't my first trip to Halo. I came here a couple days earlier with Misty S so she could get her ears stretched. I was supposed to get mine pierced that day too, but I froze up once I realized that I wasn't just going to be able to "flash my ID" to them and let that be that. They hold onto your ID until after you get the piercing done, which in the back of my paranoid and irrational mind meant that it gave them plenty of time to decide they want to "reserve their right to refuse service".  Yes, I know I'm silly. And as long as The Man keeps using his bureaucracy and red tape to keep me down, the silliness shall continue non-stop. So don't judge me.  /self-pitying rant  I sulked for a couple days, pondering. Eventually I came to the realization that it was either this or Claire's, and I was not allowed to let this simple procedure that I had romanticized into a sort of rite of passage be performed by an unqualified teenage girl with a piercing gun.   So I inevitably returned with Misty S, who had by this time decided she wanted to get her brow done. I know, how romantic, right?  Now that I wasn't trying to ignore the screaming voice inside my head, I noticed that I quite dig the feel of Halo. The staff is uber-friendly in a "gabba gabba one of us one of us" kind of way and if you think that's a Ramones reference I will throw my fucking shoe at you.  I found it really remarkable that the guy behind the counter, who had no visible piercings to the naked eye, knew so much about piercing himself.  He was actually able to talk Misty S out of something (she wanted a ring for her brow, but he presented a convincing argument as to why a barbell would be safer and easier to handle to start out with). Fuck. Even I can't talk her out of anything. Retrospectively, it might help if I actually stick with my "spitefully holding out on sex" act, but I can never keep it up for long.   I know. I know.  Our piercer was Ana, who we both absolutely fell in love with. Tall, tattooed (supposedly everywhere but her face and feet) and foul-mouthed, she had that perfect mixture of intimidating dominatrix and down-to-earth gal pal that really put us at ease over this whole "getting metal shoved through our faces while the other watched" bit, which I hate to admit was kind've erotic in its own way.  Ana, while making small talk, went into a rant about how piercing externalizes something that we feel on the inside, and that we can't allow ourselves to be limited by what the world sees us as, and after I had a good laugh much to her confusion, I confessed that I knew EXACTLY what she was talking about.  Ana took my revelation quite well, though I would've liked a little incredulousness. Nobody's ever surprised anymore.  Apparently she has some  trans clientele herself and offered to do my "how's your father?" once I, you know, get one.   So now when my surgeon asks me if I have any questions I can go "so yeah, I'm thinking of getting a piercing...how long should I wait..."  Laying down in the chair, surrounded by pictures of scantily clad women in corsets with a tall tattooed Amazon in a medical mask hovering over me while my partner watched, I couldn't remember if I was getting a piercing or if I had just been cast in a medical fetish movie.   And then she said "take a deep breath" before harpooning my left ear lobe. I winced a lilttle, I'll admit.   See Also: Big fucking crybaby.  Afterwards she did my right lobe, I cried a little more, and I got off the chair so Misty could hug me and tell me how brave I was.  See Also: Lies.  We both gave Ana a big hug and promised to come back (with chocolate, since apparently they keep pouring hard candies into her 'candy dish' and she can't fucking stand them) and went out to look for her car, which had a big sticker that said "Jesus Had A Guiche", just as she claimed it did. I wish I was wearing lipstick so I could've left an imprint on her door.   But I'm glad I didn't. I would not be surprised if Ana would just kick my ass the next time I visited.  Misty and I sat in the truck for a few minutes, looking at our fancy new piercings and drinking the Monsters that the guy at the counter had just given us for free without any real explanation. Fuck, some places won't even let you split a check, and these guys just throw free shit they've got lying around at you. That's class.  It really, in the end, wasn't that painful. We just pretended it did so we had an excuse to walk over to Red Hot Robot and begin what I predict will become a crippling obsession with vinyl toys.

=Jetta is a real person, not a childhood memory waiting to be parodied for comedic effect to lend humor to an otherwise worthless review. Don't worry though, we found one.=  JETTA When my professor said we needed Japanese sumi-e brushes and ink for our class, I freaked out a little.   SKELETOR I would have incinerated the blasted fool! Just watch him try to charge me a lab fee and insist I bring in my own supplies!  JETTA I had never even heard of this stuff, let alone know where to find it. Everyone suggested I get it online, but I couldn't risk showing up for class without them because of a shipping delay.   SKELETOR Shipping!? Have your minions raid their warehouses!   JETTA Somebody suggested Arizona Art Supply, and I was really surprised to see their selection and reasonable prices. I found my brushes and ink, and even one of those crazy multi-colored pencils. The staff was very helpful, especially the manager. She might've been the owner. I don't know.  SKELETOR Who needs customer service when you've got a staff that shoots...I think it's magic?   JETTA Since I brought my class syllabus, I got a discount and a free portfolio, which they retrieved from back since they ran out of promotional ones.   SKELETOR I have a portfolio for all of my doodles. It was fashioned out of the hides of my enemies!  JETTA Will you cut it out? I'm trying to do a testimonial.  SKELETOR "Cut it out?" Who do you think you are? Dave Coulier? I'm fucking Skeletor, The Evil Lord of Destruction! You know what happened to the last person who told me to "cut it out"? I heat him to death with his own skull!   JETTA If you don't mind, I'm trying to do a real review for once.  SKELETOR You? Real review? Ha! I'll believe that when I see Prince Adam and He-Man in the same room.  JETTA He-Man was a bitch. She-Ra was way better.  SKELETOR Why are you visiting art supply stores, anyway? I always thought you were more of a "performing arts" type.   JETTA My advisor said it would be good to expand my horizons.  SKELETOR See? This is why you'd make a horrible arch-villain! "My advisor told me this, my advisor told me that..." Screw your advisor! She's a pencil-pushing simpleton! Hang her from a cage over a bottomless abyss! Cast a curse upon her and her family! CHRIST! I don't need this. I fought the Masters of the Universe!   JETTA Hey, while you're here, just between us, can I ask you a question? Are you a lich?  SKELETOR A lich?  JETTA You know, the whole skull-head thing you got going on. I thought maybe you were a lich.  SKELETOR Fool, I am an evil genius, not some Dungeons and Dragons monster. I'm outta here. I got lunch with Megatron at the titty bar.  JETTA Right. So. Arizona Art Supply. Good wares and 'mom and pop shop' customer service with discount prices. If you need art supplies, you should go there, and not just because, you know, it's "local". Although you should always shop locally, when you can. Places like Wal-Mart ruin local businesses, and bring nothing but misery and poverty wherever they go. Hey, where are you going? I'm not done. No, wait, I'm not--- BEWARE! THE SHOPOCALYPSE IS UPON US! BARGAIN BUYERS, REPENT!

I have to come to understand and accept that I am probably the reason restaurateurs  hate yelpers.  I just have no appreciation for atmosphere. I know this because during my 12-day stay in the Bay area, the word had to be repeatedly hammered into my brain, as the natives could not understand how I could merely judge a restaurant's merit based solely on their cuisine.   Eventually they wrote me off as a lost cause, chalking up my dis-appreciation of fine decor and tacky acoustic music as a symptom of being Phoenician.   For a while I was confused. I didn't know what was wrong with me. Was I just impossible to please? Had I no taste for aesthetics? Oh shit, I have no aesthetic sensibility. I'm an art major. What does that mean for me?  All I have is a clock radio. Who am I Mommy?  I was beginning to have some serious doubts about my aptitude for critique.   Sweet Zombie Jesus. Maybe I didn't know what I was talking about all this time.  After all, Angie and Jimmie's is as far from atmosphere as you could be. Like, as far as John Cage is from actual music, or Miley Cyrus from being talented.   Fun Fact: While in San Carlos we saw a guy parked underneath a Miley Cyrus billboard giving himself some of the old "self-service at the pump". True story.  There are no polished tables and cushy chairs at A&J's. No, instead they have those all-plastic all-purpose chairs that last you years and years sitting in your backyard until you invite that one plus-sized friend of yours who sits in it and bends it in such a way that is is never usable again.   And there is no ambient music. Only the sounds of the arcade machines and the TV, which no matter what time of day is always playing a crime drama. Or a Billy Mays infomercial.   "HI BILLY MAYS HERE BUY SOME FUCKING OXI-CLEAN OR I'LL SHOVE SOME MIGHTY PUTTY UP YOUR ASS WHILE I BANG YOUR WIFE!"  The staff at A&J care as much about presentation as Fred Phelps does about receiving a box set of "The L Word" for Christmas.  Their wings are not soaked in the sauce (BBW calls the process "spinning") like at other joints. No, the wings are cooked, and then, the sauce is poured over them. At first you're like "this is fucking shady, I am not pleased with this", but when you can actually taste the chicken, and dont' have to ask for like fifty extra napkins, you find you might actually walk away from the table with some dignity.   Try saying the same thing after paying 9 bucks for half a sandwich while ten pounds of bitch in a five pound bag asks you if you have room for dessert.  The subs are meaty and quite sustaining. So I've heard. I have a rule about ordering shit that isn't on the sign. I've never ordered a cheeseburger at Del Taco or chicken nuggets at a Red Lobster, and here I am, still alive and kicking. The system works.  The pizza is simply fucking fabulous. It's crispy but never crunchy, hot but never molten, and cheesy but never "hey, how long are you going to be on the toilet? I need to take a shower" cheesy. Honestly, the only pizza I've had in Phoenix that even compares to it is Pizza A Metro...which is another small independently owned pizza shop crammed next to a Circle K...  ...  Maybe it isn't me. Maybe it's just Phoenix. Or just the west side of it. Everything's backwards here. It's like Bizarro world.  All the best food is located in these hole-in-the-walls, where the decor is haphazard the menus have to be laminated because people are always spilling shit on them.   There's still a pretty good chance that I'm a tasteless Philistine, but we're  in Bizarro World and that makes me a learned connoisseur of wealth and taste.   I fucking love it here.

Ever since I started getting daily e-mails from my bureaucratic overlords reminding me of the impending layoffs, unpaid furloughs and "department consolidations" I have to look forward to, I've been cutting back on going out and actually enjoying myself. Mostly because they cut all my hours and I still need to find a way to pay my therapist.  So for the last week or so it's (haha, proper use of the apostrophe, bitches) been ramen noodles, rice, ramen noodles, peanut butter, and ramen noodles.   I've been trying to make the most of it. I look up ramen recipes on the internet. I make aesthetically pleasing bentos out of them. I even put pictures of my lunch on my livejournal, perhaps to maintain the illusion that I'm "challenging myself" rather than desperately clinging to the edge of poverty.  Alas, no how I try to psyche myself, there is no pick me up for the buzz kill one experiences when eating 15 cent noodles in front of your computer when your stomach and smug sense of culture are screaming for something...more...  Like dim sum. Like Great Wall's dim sum.  This morning I was stewing another batch of "failure food" when the insane craving for dim sum hit me like homosexual tendencies striking a fundamentalist preacher giving a sermon on how G*d hates Rastafarians.  On the outside, Great Wall looks like another two-bit strip mall attraction. You know, like all the stores next to it. But inside it's like the dining room of Hotel Awesome, where somewhat discontent-looking servers push around carts of delicious and deliver plates of FUCK YEAH to your table where you and your party can divvy them up/fight over them. Whatever fits your interpretation of Darwinism.  To be honest I'm surprised more people don't fight over the food.  For a mound of their delicious lo mein I would probably break a chair over someone's face.   For a plate of their pork buns I would falcon punch someone in front of their kids.  This may seem a little aggressive...but it can be a fucking battle royale in there.  Especially when you don't have anyone in your party who speaks the language.  "Uh, yes, I'll take some of that, no, that, yes the thing with the shrimp in it. Oh, and some of that, too. No. To the right. Yes. Oh shit, where'd our ticket go?"  I remember watching a Muppet Babies episode once where the children were eating gruel or something and they suggested trying to imagine it as something tastier.  I tried that. It's a lot harder than it looks.  You swirl those nickel-and-dime noodles around on your fork and you try to imagine crab puffs or plates of peppered shrimp or mango pudding.  You try to imagine being surrounded by all your friends, plus some people you've just met, plus a whole restaurant of people speaking in their cafeteria voices (i.e. screaming at the top of their lungs).  And then you open your eyes and take a bite.  And you realize that you're alone in front of your computer screen with a mouth full of chopstick because in your daydreaming you drop your ramen all over yourself.   Fuck.  I would crash a mini-motorcycle into someone's groin right now for a plate of their lumpia or shrimp dumplings.  Dammit.  Does anyone need someone to paint their nails and take them out shopping?   I can't keep living like this.

Whenever I think of Lenny's Burger, I think of that urban myth about ecstasy.   You know the one.  "If you have sex on ecstasy, you'll never be able to enjoy it sober."    Why, because the experience is that intense, or because you're brain has been so fried that you can't realize you've spent the last twenty minutes trying to fondle a rock?   And why the fuck are you dropping this on me now? Like I'm not stressed out enough worrying about how a ouija board works and whether or not Mountain Dew depletes your sperm count. Shut up, you.  Lenny's Burger is the ecstasy of hamburger joints.  You go in there not expecting much. Perhaps even a little condescending because you're so fucking spoiled you don't know any better.  "Ha! Look at this ironically low-end establishment! Why, they don't even have a value menu! Bush league! Oh, how cute. They expect you to pump your own condiments. What, couldn't afford the little packets? Ha. This shall be a good laugh."  And then you order, I don't know, for argument's sake, a double-patty chili burger. And fries. And let's just say that, for shits and giggles, you fill your drink cup up with horchata, because it's my fucking scenario.  You bring your order back to your table. Ha. How quaint. Burgers served in a noisy steamy cafeteria setting. How retro.   One minute you're biting into a slab of meat in between some bread.  And the next you're in fucking Willy Wonka land.  Your taste buds suddenly become Charlie and Veruca and Augustus.  HOLY SHIT THIS BEEF TASTES LIKE IT CAME FROM A REAL ANIMAL! AND THIS CHILI'S FRESH! THE BUN IS TOASTED! JESUS TAPDANCING CHRIST, THESE ARE THE MOST AMAZING FRIES EVER! I'VE NEVER HAD BURGER JOINT FRIES THIS GOOD! AND THIS HORCHATA FUCKING ROCKS! IT TASTES JUST LIKE I IMAGINE HORCHATA WOULD TASTE!  And believe me, muchachos, if there were snozberries on that burger, they would taste like snozberries.  By the time you've finished your burger, you already crave one again.  You spend the next few weeks trying to convince your friends to try it with you.  "Dude, you have to try this burger place. They have the most amazing fuck me burgers ever! Seriously." "Nah, man. I'm good."  WHAT!? Bitch, you did not just turn down a suggestion from an Elite!  Weeks later, you find that nobody wants to try this place.  Because they're all trying to get clean.  They're trying to cut back on the fast food. Get on a good diet, go vegan, cut out the refined sugars and carbs or whatever the fuck it is that people with a nutrition book do.  It's not you. They're not turning YOU down.  They just know. They know because they've seen it happen.  One Lenny's Burger and suddenly they're lives will go out of control all over again.  One bite of a double-patty country burger with cheese and chili fries and suddenly they'll start double-dipping and eating right before they go to bed, and years from now they'll be wearing those electronic belts that zap the fat off of you while they get their cry on to a very special episode of Maury Povich.  It's just you and Lenny's now.   You'll do your best to be stoic about it. Eating alone while tables of laughing hipsters and married couples enjoy their hearty meal, stopping to give you the occasional look as they slowly decide in their minds what could possibly be so wrong with you as to force you to eat your meals alone.  "Just come with me once. I'll pay for it." "No thanks. I'd rather do McDonald's." "WHAT!? Didn't you watch Super Size Me?" "Actually, I just did. Now I want a Big Mac." "Fine...just this once."  Go on, buddy. Try and enjoy that, what do they call it, a Large N' Delicious? A Royale With Cheese?   Yeah, I'm sure you like it going in, let's see how you like it coming back out.  Your stomach/intestines aren't fooled. It wants the good shit. It's not going to settle for this "McBullshit" you're trying to feed it.  Just deal with it. You've been bought and paid for by Lenny's Burger Shop.   You are Bitch Numero Uno.  Awww, don't cry. Ronald McLittleKid'sNightmare didn't like you anyway. But Lenny's Burger, Lenny's will always love you. It will always be there for you. It will never judge you, and will even forgive this little "selling out" phase you went through. It's okay. We all make mistakes.  Now...would you like cheese with that?  Hopefully today you have learned something, and understand the downward spiral that is consumption of actual food.  Be good, stay in school, listen to your parents, and remember, what doesn't give you high blood pressure and diabetes will only make you stronger.

People often ask me how, with a college education and medical transition already on my plate, how I can afford to eat out so often. And the answer is simple; I can't. Between student loans, hormones, and, uh, chocolate chip scones (agh!!! crowd goes wild!), I owe so much money that instead of rejection letters the credit card companies just laugh as hard as they can into an envelope and send that to me instead.  So I can afford to eat out when the occasion calls for it, I have at least two weeks worth of ramen, dried meats & fruits and green tea stored up in my kitchen to hold me over on those week/ends I'm as broke as the ten commandments and can't go out and get my grub on.   But you see, run of the mill prepackaged imperishable foodstuffs are not enough to satiate my strange appetite and lifestyle; why, can you imagine how much a fool I would look, Jetta, the self-proclaimed Prophetess of Fabulous, were found in the possession of mere chicken-flavored top ramen and beef jerky? My reputation would shrink faster than my testosterone levels. And I can't lose both.  No, I am a finicky mistress. I demand grotesquely cheap food with quirky Engrish packaging that will outlast a nuclear winter. And for such fare there is no better destination than Lam's Seafood. Not necessarily because it's in a great location, but because I know nobody else will go inside.   Lam's can be a scary, scary place for the uninitiated. Korean and Filipino music is blasted through the speakers. The air smells of strange fruit and fish still alive in their tanks. The aisles are packed with food you've never even thought of eating, like prawn-flavored chips and chocolate-stuffed eggrolls. Any legible English found on the packaging is poorly translated and laden with idiom. I imagine if by some freak accident you woke up inside of Hello Kitty's brain, Lam's is what it would look like. Maybe pinker. And with more J-Pop. Okay, it's a crappy analogy but I have to finish this review, too late to go back and fix it.  But fret not, like configuring a blue tooth headset and insalling Firefox for the first time, once you get over the "oh my god this is totally foreign to me" hump you'll be just fine. Ask someone for help, or bring a friend. Or date an Asian person. Whatever it takes to adapt to this brave new world.   Before you know it, you'll have the upper hand in cheap, delicious Asian finds. While college students and World of Warcrafters are breaking up  packets of the same old beef-flavored ramen, you'll be drowning your taste buds in instant hot and sour soup and the fancier, imported ramen (the kind with three seasoning packets so you know it's classy).   Who needs frozen turkey burgers when you've got fresh lumpia, bean cakes and seafood that, despite still being alive when you come into the store, is cheaper and tastier than any seafood section in Wal-Mart?  You'll be getting your chomp on to dried squid and chili-flavored prawn chips. And won't you look snazzy at your desk sipping Malaysian mango fruit juice and nibbling on coconut wafers while you're less fortunate, less fabulous officemates choke down their coke and peanuts.  The world of budget eating will be your oyster.  Or you'll find it totally gross and frustrating, sticking to your Fry's brand cookies and TV dinners.   Which is cool, yo. I mean, we can't all be into the same things.   Because if all you, you know, financially responsible adults start shopping there too, they'll be apt to raise the prices. Then I'll have to find somewhere else to get my ramen hook-up, and if you follow me there too you'll so totally be a poser. Or a stalker. Surprisingly I'd prefer if you were the latter. I have problems. Maybe when I'm not paying for a therapist I can afford to eat like a grown up. But I probably won't.  Me love Lam's long time. There, okay? I tried going the whole review without using Engrish, and I couldn't. I just couldn't.  Thank god I have all these Filipino cookies so I can eat away my shame.

==Reasons Why Nobody Goes To Rollero Anymore==  1. No Roller Derby.  2. Ever-permeating smell of stale sweat and negligence.   3. No Roller Derby.  4. A  dress code reminiscent of an overzealous public school (no muscle shirts, no skirts, no hoodies, no hats or headgear of any kind, boys can't wear makeup and girls can't wear baggy jeans).    5.  No Roller Derby.  6. Rules and Regulations, Puritan-Style. No touching, no going ahead of people, no laughter, no dancing. Name calling is prohibited unless you are alerting the staff to the presence of a witch. Or a boy in makeup. Egad! And No Gayness Of Any Sort! (Think I'm kidding? Try and hold hands with someone of the same sex.)  7. No Roller Derby.  8. An absence of recent movies featuring compelling roller-skating protagonists may have contributed to the overall disinterest in roller-skating.  9. No fucking Roller Derby.  10. The Eatza Pizza that used to be across the street has since moved.

==A Slice Of You==  A romantic comedy by Jetta  (The dimly lit pavement of a strip mall parking lot. JETTA, a glamazon in her early twenties, stares longingly into the night. An alluring ingenue with a dark and questionable past, she shivers in 90 degree night, tears forming in her eyes. Behind her is PIZZA PATRON, a tall, fedora-wearing gentleman. He sports a mustache that doesn't play by the rules. JETTA knows he is behind her.)  JETTA I'm sorry. I just can't.  PIZZA PATRON Why can't you let me love you, Jetta?  JETTA Because there's nothing left of me to love. I've been burned before. Lured by promises of reasonably priced large one-toppings and hearty, flavorful hot wings. Only to be given hot plates of garbage and crunchy and disturbingly misshapen wings of what I can imagine were once, long before growth hormones, in fact chickens. I don't known if I can trust you.  PIZZA PATRON But I'm not like the others.  JETTA They all say that. I like you, PP. I like your logo depicting a Federale whose about to cut me open and empty my stomach of all that cocaine I spent all morning stuffing in. I like how you scream "PIZZA PATRON!" at the top of your lungs to me whenever I step in the store. I like your queso sticks and chorizo-topped pizza. I even like how you accept pesos in lieu of dollars, no matter how many shithead right-wingers boycott and protest your storefront. Don't you see? I like you. If I open my heart to you, I could risk hating you. Can't we just settle for "like"?  PIZZA PATRON What would be the point? Why offer a 4.99 large one-topping if the box isn't going to litter your living room floor. Why offer lime and pepper-flavored chicken wings if I can't know that somewhere, it's you're lips sucking the meat off the bone? Don't you see, Jetta? Without you taking advantage of my ridiculously underpriced food, there'd be no reason to make it in the first place. I don't know how else to say this--  JETTA Shhh. You had me at "$4.99 one topping".   (The two embrace. Music plays dramatically in the background.)  Somebody put a stop to me. Please.

PC is one of those low brow chain stores that everyone thumbs their noses at until they desperately need something from there. That's right, Party City, you're the Wal-Mart of party supply stores.   And what's with the clever misnomer? I've been inside PC many an unfortunate occasion, and have yet to see a party. Only disheveled parents shuffling around trash-strewn aisles searching for Dora the Explorder party favors. I never understood party favors. I mean, I can see giving your guests some leftover finger food or some unopened bottles of soda/liquor on their way out, but no one ever says "HOT DAMN THAT WAS AN AWESOME PARTY! AND LOOK, I GOT A FUCKING NINJA TURTLES NOISEMAKER! THIS WAS THE BEST PARTY EVER!"  When I host a party, I admittedly make goodie bags for the guests, but they're usually full of things they're going to use during or after the party (lotion, candy, condoms, I'm not going to elaborate any further). You're not going to find any of that useful shit at Party City.   And anybody who admits to have bought their costume at Party City isn't going to be at any parties where there will be pictures taken. Because there is nothing worse than browsing through pictures of a party and hearing people chuckle "where the fuck did he/she get that costume?". Do yourself a favor and buy a real costume, or make one yourself.   And for the record, anything from Legs Avenue does not count as a costume. Legs Avenue costumes are constructed around one simple premise; that one can have sex in it without having to do any major adjusting. That's not a costume you're wearing, it's very elaborate underwear. Go to Spirit or Easley's, get a real costume, and God help you if you come back as a schoolgirl or as The Crow.   The most intriguing aspect of PC is their hiring policy. While Guitar Center may actually attempt to hire people who know stuff about guitars, Party City goes out of their way to hire people with no party-attending experience.   Got a question? So do they; why are you asking? They don't know. They're just here until Zia Records starts hiring again.  The one thing Party City does well is uphold corporate standards. Every store is at the same level of filthiness, and every staff member is guaranteed to be the idiot you were hoping they wouldn't be. It's exactly the kind of insipid conformity you'd expect from a chain.  Just give me a few more minutes and I'll get off the high horse.  I'm hostessing a Halloween party this month, and you can bet you won't find me looking for skeleton napkins and vampire plates here. Unless I forget to buy them earlier and end up running here because it's right by my house and really convenient, but I will totally lie about where I got them if you ask me later. Don't ask to see the receipt. It's in the trash with my Wal-Mart receipt and Whopper wrapper.

==Honey, Why Do You Hate That Sonic So Much?==  A tragifarce in one act by Jetta  (Drive-Thru at a Sonic. JETTA, a quirky yet attractive woman in her early twenties, sits patiently in her car as the staff inside hustle and bustle to fill her order. She fiddles with the radio. She checks her polish. She turns the car off. A greasy-faced SONIC EMPLOYEE sticks his head out.)  SONIC EMPLOYEE Here's your strawberry slush, ma'am.  JETTA Thank you. Hold on, don't go yet.  (JETTA pops the lid to the slush. The cup is filled ENTIRELY WITH FLAVORLESS ICE.)  JETTA This doesn't look like strawberry. I think you gave me the wrong flavor.  SONIC EMPLOYEE No, actually, by this time of the day the slush machines freeze over, and they all come out like that.   JETTA Why didn't you tell me that twenty minutes ago when I ordered it?  SONIC EMPLOYEE Didn't think you would mind.  JETTA Mind what, being charged a dollar and some change for a cup of blended ice? You knowingly brought this to me and thought it would be acceptable.  SONIC EMPLOYEE I wasn't expecting you to check it.  JETTA I want another flavor.   SONIC EMPLOYEE Okay.  JETTA Wait. You're just going to give me another cup of ice.  SONIC EMPLOYEE The machine's frozen. I told you.  JETTA Just get me an ocean water. Same size.   SONIC EMPLOYEE Sure thing.   (SONIC EMPLOYEE and JETTA exchange cups. She pops open the lid.)  JETTA This is coke. Ocean Waters have sprite.  SONIC EMPLOYEE Sprite machine's out.  JETTA So you just thought you'd substitute coke and hope I wouldn't notice?   SONIC EMPLOYEE  Can I get you something else?  JETTA Yes. Just get me a coke with some vanilla, cherry, and chocolate flavoring. Please. Thank you.  SONIC EMPLOYEE  Will you pull up in one of the spaces and wait in the dining area? You're holding up traffic.  (JETTA parks her car and walks over to the dining area. She fiddles with an item in her purse, visibly trying with little success to restrain her anger. SONIC EMPLOYEE steps out with soda, a smirk on his face.)  SONIC EMPLOYEE A coke with vanilla, coke, and chocolate flavoring for the la-  (SONIC EMPLOYEE, now face to face with JETTA, stops in his tracks. JETTA stands a full foot over him, a sneering face atop mannishly broad shoulders. SONIC EMPLOYEE drops the soda to the floor. JETTA looks down. It was water.)  SONIC EMPLOYEE Sorry. Wrong order. I'll be right back.  (SONIC EMPLOYEE sheepishly returns with another soda. JETTA opens it in front of them, looking inside. She nods, signaling her minimal satisfaction.)  SONIC EMPLOYEE Here's your money.  (The SONIC EMPLOYEE hands JETTA a dollar bill and some change. Laughter and stares from the kitchen. The SONIC EMPLOYEE averts his eyes, staring at the spilled cup on the ground below.)  SONIC EMPLOYEE Have a good day, ma'am. Thank you for your patience.  (JETTA sashays off to her car, sipping happily at her flavored soda. SONIC EMPLOYEE, sulking, returns to the kitchen to ruin someone else's night.)

After eating at Wong's, you'll  hate yourself for having ever had Panda Express.  The first thing you notice about Wong's is how misleading the outside is. It's wedged between a used book store and a bridal store and looks about as big as a taco truck. You get inside, however, and a large, superbly decorated dining room awaits you. I have never, in all the years I've gone to Wong's, waited for a table. Literally, I'm seated half a minute within entering. Even during the lunch rush, there's always room.   Tea is provided, and between that and the water, you probably won't want to order a coke or anything. The tea takes some getting used to, but soon you won't be able to eat lo mein without it. And expect to get your water glass refilled like at least a dozen times. Literally, I've never actually finished a glass of water before it was refilled.   The staff is so accommodating and hospitable, it's like eating in a family's dining room table. The service is so on par that out of the years I've been going, only one guy has ever complained about his food. Have you ever seen other patrons at a restaurant tell a complaining customer to STFU? Well, that's how awesome Wong's is. No joke.  The food is, like, whoa. Personally I prefer the lunch specials, where you get the entree, fried rice, egg roll and soup for about the cost of a McMeal Deal. Dinner comes with a big pot of rice that you and your friends will never finish so don't even try.  Foods I Recommend: Pork Lo Mein, Emperor's Chicken, Shrimp Lo Mein, Sweet and Sour Pork, Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken, and Chow Mein.  The menu they offer is also super easy to understand, with clear cut descriptions of all the entrees, which is nice, because nothing irritates me more than a Chinese eatery that serves you soft noodles and calls it "chow mein".

If restaurants were fairy tales, Waffle House is "Prince and the Pauper". Its an exercise in humility. It allows you to see how the rest of the world eats while you're eating 25 dollar salads.  "Oh what a wonderfully horrid place! Now, if we could only find the hostess..."  Can't afford a hostess. Sorry. Just find a table. Try to find one that's clean.   "Very well. Oh, I do think I would enjoy some sparkling water and cranberry juice-"  There's soda and there's coffee. Or they have two flavors of water; dirty tap and dirty tap with ice.   "Oh, um, very well. There doesn't seem to be enough menus for everyone at our party."  Share.  "Oh...um, fair enough then. I will have the all-star special, with cheese on my eggs and, how do you say it, my hash browns 'smothered' and 'covered'? Oh that sounds so delightfully filthy."  Whatever turns you on, man.  "Oh dear me, they're cooking it right in front of us...that man's not wearing any plastic gloves! He's man-handling my food with his bare hands! This is outrageo--oh wait...is this how you lowly folk eat? Well then, don't mind me! GET YOUR HANDS ALL OVER MY FOOD, GOOD MAN! IN FACT, I WOULD LIKE SOME EXTRA HAIR IN MY BACON! HAHAHA!"  ...  "No, seriously, I didn't want any hair in my bacon"  Okay, well let me just pluck it out off your plate. All better then.  "Did you just put YOUR hands on my food too!? The gall! The bravado! I love it!"  How's your food?  "My bacon's crunchy, I can feel the cheese you've smothered all over my eggs clogging my arteries, these hash browns are a texture and consistency I've never seen occur in nature anywhere, and another cup of this coffee and I'll be able to do wind sprints back to my house. I absolutely love it! I'm never going back to my old life of roasted pheasant and caviar ever again. Do you hear me world, EVAR!"  It's something like that. For serious.

--Apathetic, uninformed teenage waste case employees who couldn't set up their outgoing message on their voice mail but still insist they know which external hard drive YOU NEED for MAXIMUM VALUE.  --Meaningless, redundant shelf tags that never, ever correlate with the product placed above it.  --"Impulse buy" candy and junk food that's already passed its expiration date.  --Defective, twice-returned equipment packaged in damaged, thrice-returned packaging held together with tape and labels.  --Bathrooms that are uncomfortably crowded with all those same fucking employees that can never be found when you have a question, compulsively washing their hands and talking about that ass hole who cock blocked them the night before.  --Bitch with a clipboard. Hey, stop making tally marks and get on a register and ring me up. Maybe if you weren't lurking around the cashiers and making your little notes you'd have a better turnover rate.  ...Shit.  I forgot what I was doing.  Was I writing a review for Fry's Electronics or making a list of "Things Not To Have If You Want A Respectable Electronics Store".  Oh fuck it.  I've been here a few times. It might as well be a review.   No one reads this stuff for accurate factual information anyway.

HIM -- Sound was terrible. The band actually sounded better when heard from the lobby. How do I know this? I had to spend the second half of HIM's set in the lobby because I was banned from the actual "performance space" when I punched some kid who had knocked my mother over while moshing...by himself. Yes, I go to concerts with my mother. She just has this thing for Scandinavian guys. She just loves boys in makeup. That probably explains why she was so enamored with my younger brother. Until I decided I wanted to be a girl. Now we're best buds and my brother hates me. I have family issues.  CKY -- Security got me good on this one. I was like "I'll get by with no problem. I'll leave my wallet chain in my car." Then I get there and they're all like "all that loose change in your pocket? It's gotta go." Um, gotta go where? Certainly not the trash. That would be ridiculous, throwing money away. Oh...I get it...you mean it's gotta go in YOUR POCKET. Well, normally you wouldn't, you know, EXTORT money from a patron, but it's either that or risk me hitting a guy in the face with three dollars worth of quarters and dimes, right? Well, okay, if you say so. If it's really for safety purposes...HEY, I DID NOT JUST SEE YOU BUYING A FUCKING SODA WITH MY FUCKING QUARTERS!  Mindless Self Indulgence/Kill Hannah -- What do you mean 26 dollars a ticket? What? Kill Hannah's not the headliner? We were told it was a Kill Hannah show, not a, who are these jabronis, Mindless Self Indulgence? Oh shit, I said that out loud, huh? Everyone's looking at me funny. Are they famous? Fuck, I'll just buy the ticket anyway. We'll just pretend I'm being facetious.   Me -- Ashamed as I am to admit it, deep down I dream of playing at the Marquee, so I can know that people loved me enough to put up with these shenanigans to see me make an ass out of myself on stage. There's always hoping.

Tempe is full of assholes willing to rip college students off.   The worst of these are the hookah bars. Wretched hives of scum and villainy that peddle over-priced, sub-par sheesha and smoke-flavored beverages to the dumbshit transplants who don't know any better.  In their defense, many of them deserve it.   Most of them don't know what they're doing, and don't care to learn.  They can't be bothered to find out whether the sheesha that's being stuffed in bowl is pre-packaged or freshly made. They don't even know how to tell if the hookah's been cleaned out. And they don't care to, either.  All they know is that whatever it is that they're doing is making them "cultured".   This is why I don't tell any of my college friends about Red Sea Cafe.  Not that they'd know where to find it even if they're looking for it. Lodged in between a Club Tattoo (which for some reason owns 90 percent of the parking spaces) and some Eurotrash hell hole, Red Sea is quite the hidden treasure.  But damn is it worth it.  The first thing you'll notice is that they actually card everyone who comes in. For real.   Surprisingly, this cuts down on the douchebag factor. Hmmm.  Unlike other hookah bars, who simply pull their sheesha out of a package (and then sell those packages for 25 cents when the expiration date's approaching), Red Sea makes it themselves. There's always someone in the back, mixing a fresh batch of some exquisite flavor or another.  Btw, try the Jello-O flavor. For reals.  Red Sea has plush, massive couches for you to lay on. None of this "sitting on the floor" shit that you get at Tut's. Seriously, who makes their paying customers sit on the floor? Even Wal-Mart has benches.  And unlike other hookah bars, where the same three hip hop/techno songs as loud as the stereo or the law will allow, Red Sea prefers the "play an entire album at a reasonable album" approach.  When you're inhaling some of that fine peach or cherry to some Pink Floyd, you'll wonder how you ever lived trying to shout over the sound system and dancing teenagers to tell the uninterested "waiter" that you want a refill.   It's enough to make you wish your friends went back on their pledge to quit smoking.

It was a Saturday. I think. I can't be so sure of it these days. I live my life with such reckless abandon that every day might as well be Saturday. But I'm pretty sure this was one of those "real Saturdays" where walking around in my jammies and showing up at people's houses at 10pm with the latest knock-off "mockbuster" on DVD is considered "normal behavior" and not chalked up to "harmless yet nonetheless annoying eccentricity".  With the recent price hikes on campus (4.99 for a sandwich that thinks it's a burrito? Have your mental disorder on your own dime, punk!), I've taken to "brown bagging" (which is what I call it even though I carry my lunch in a metal Dr. Pepper lunchbox that also doubles as a purse. I'm eccentric. Didn't you get the memo?) my on-campus meals.   Which means I spend my weekends at Fry's looking at the lunch meat aisle going "Hmmm...which of these could I eat every day for two weeks and not forcibly strangle myself with my own vomit?"  On my way back to my car, laden with plastic bags full to bursting with failure and sad, I passed by the Dragon Garden Express, glancing at their menu.   I initially decided against it, heading back to my car so I could feng shui my refrigerator to accommodate my ASU Meal Plan, when I heard the restaurant calling me.  Which is a metaphor for "crazy manager screaming at me from the door".  "YOU WANT MENU TO TAKE HOME!?"  Nah, I thought. If I took home a menu I'd just sit there, thinking of how much happier I'd have been if I spent my grocery money on an afternoon's worth of sweet and sour pork.  "YOU COME IN THEN! GET SOMETHING TO GO!"  Maybe the screaming Asian woman related to my lament. Perhaps she thought her cuisine would lift my spirits.  Or maybe it was a really slow day.  I decided to come inside before anyone got hurt.  You know how in the early Mario Bros games, you always played as Mario, although the manuals clearly state that Luigi is faster and can jump higher than the crimson-hued Ron Jeremy?  That's how it felt when I walked in.  Even though it was the weekend, DGE still offered lunch specials. Most places, Wong's included, exclude weekends from any of their lunch of dinner specials. Which is convenient, of course, because that's when Wong's gets most of its customers. DGE, despite it clearly being Saturday, offered 5 and 6 dollar lunch combos.   The atmosphere in DGE is just...happier. I'm not sure how to describe it. When I go to other local Chinese restaurants the mood is so dapper. Like everyone's just waiting for that screenplay to writing to get picked up. Like the whole "serve cuisine of our homeland" game got really old, really fast, but they put all their eggs in one basket and have to wait for them to hatch and become dragons and burn the village or something.   But DGE just has this happy, quiet vibe to it. And clean to boot. The place is splotless, with a hint of chow mein goodness. If I ever own a house, that's what I'd want my kitchen looking/smelling like all the time.  Initially I was hesitant to try the combos. Because I'm not big on fried rice. That's Panda Express' redeeming quality. It lets me have my lo mein noodles on the side, instead of demanding that I have it as an entree.  I figure if you can get a Big Mac with chicken nuggets on the side, I should be able to get mu shu with lo mein on the side. Oh well.  I took the plunge anyway. I got the kung pao. They boxed it up in one of those styrofoam take-home boxes with the smiling face. Which I always find a nice touch. All these other places like to decorate their packaging with proclamations of how awesome their product is. This was a thank you note and motivational propaganda all at once. I love the digital age.  The kung pao was cruncy and soupy, like a chicken and peanut cereal. It was like eating a salad and occasionally drinking from a cup of hot sauce at the same time. The egg roll was chewy and savory, the rangoons were crispy and cheesy, and the small mound of fried rice was fine also.    I was too involved in plowing through my awesome with a side of FUCKYEAH! that I couldn't even be bothered to tell my housemates where I had discovered this little treasure trove of chicken, peanuts, and whatever the hell else they put in kung pao.   I just kept showing them my receipt, which I kept just in case I had to add in the business info when I eventually yelped it.   The moral of this mindless, meandering story?   If you want good, cheap takeout on a weekend, do Dragon Garden Express.  Or they will scream at you.

==Cold Stone Creamery New Hire Questionnaire==  Below are a series of scenarios that you are likely to encounter while working at Cold Stone Creamery. Please answer with what you feel is the best and most appropriate response.   1) Customer A and Customer B are waiting in line. While Customer B has already given you their order, Customer A hasn't decided yet, and asks for a sample. Then another. Five minutes pass, and they are still asking for samples. Customer B is becoming impatient. What do you do?  A. Ring up Customer B's order while Customer A decides. B. Suggest that Customer A either decide on a flavor or wait outside of the line until they do. C. Keep giving Customer A samples until they decide. If Customer B wanted their ice cream so bad, they would've come earlier.  2. A customer asks for an unusual mix-in for their ice cream (i.e. cake batter with gummi bears). Though you personally would not eat such a combination, the customer is very adamant about it. Do you:  A. Just make the order and move on; to each their own. B. Ask the customer if they've tried it before to make sure you heard them right. C.  Proceed to try and talk them out of their decision. If this fails, simply pretend to include the aforementioned mix-in but instead switch it with another, more practical topping. You're the ice cream expert.  3. A customer has run off with the tip jar containing some spare change less than five dollars. It's a Friday night, and there is a constant stream of movie theater patrons coming in and out of the store. Do you:  A. Call the complex security or the police and report the incident, maintaining the flow of business.  B. Just set up another tip jar where the old one was. It's a Friday night. You'll easily make all that back. C. Tell the remaining customers that you're closed, force them out of the store (use expletives if necessary). Run to the movie theater security and ask them to help you find the culprit. Don't forget to interrogate the remaining customers. One of them knew who did it.  4. A customer says that they offered a chocolate-covered waffle cone, but instead got a plain one. How do you fix the situation?  A. Take their ice cream and gently dump it into a chocolate cone. B. Bring them a new chocolate dipped cone so they can make the change themselves. C. They're liars trying to get a free upgrade. Teach them a lesson by drizzling chocolate sauce all over their cone and hands.   There's no need to check the answers. The correct answer to each one is C. If you selected A or B for any of the questions, you may not be Cold Stone Creamery material. Perhaps Dairy Queen will hire you, stupid.  If you got the test right, ask the hiring manager for your apron and start learning the lyrics to those tip songs, you're in the business of frozen treats! Get ready to scoop up some fun!

I recommend Sushi Yuki to anyone who believes that good sushi can not be found in a land-locked state. Also for anyone whose a little shy about ordering sushi for the first time. The menu has very concise descriptions of all the sushi, and the tables even have diagrams with pictures on them (granted, they're promotional material from one of the beer vendors they carry, but still).   Personally I recommend the boat. It's filling, it has a lovely layout, and  you can pretend you're a sea serpent or something.   If you hear the waitress laughing it's because you're eating the garnish. Take it out of your mouth and put it away.

Hot lesbians...check. Adorable gay couples...check. Foxy ladies of ambiguous birth gender...check and check. Awkward straight guy with popped collar with wary look in eyes...check. Tight music that I'd never admit to liking outside of the club...check and balance.  Yeah. I couldn't love this place more even if some random act of kindness made my heart grow three times larger.   Don't let that stop you from walking up to me and giving me a sandwich and five bucks, though.

As a kid I wanted superpowers. I wasn't picky about it; any power would've been sufficient. Super strength. Super speed. I'd even have settled for being able to break things just by screaming. But alas, instead of super powers all I got where good looks and charm. It's not easy, but I try to live with it as best I can.  Yesterday something happened to me, though. Something extraordinary. Something that cannot be explained with science. Or logic. Or even algorithms (I tried.) I believe I may have stumbled upon the secret to my secret abilities.  Amanda B and I came to Pane Bianco after the Anti-Prop 102/Prop 8 rally. I was hungering for equal rights and social justice, but in the meantime I had to settle for salad and bread.  While waiting for our food Amanda turned to me and said "I'm going over to Lux. You want anything?"  And without thinking I said "Sure. Surprise me."  I swear to Cthulu the entire restaurant froze in place. The two girls at the counter, Amanda, even the guy in the make making my salad, everyone, for the briefest of moments, were trapped in stasis by my naivety.   By the power of n00bity, I had stopped time. Fuck. How do I unstop it?  Thankfully Amanda, who over time has built an immunity to my occasional outburst of teh dumb, fixed the situation.  "Ummmm...there's a lot to choose from. Maybe you want to make it more specific?"  "Yeah, hahaha." Oh. Great. The girl at the counter has unfrozen herself too, isn't that nice.  "Perhaps coffee...tea..."  "Tea. Iced. Something fruity." I tried to laugh the whole incident off, but there was no denying it, we all felt it; I almost broke Pane Bianco with my stupid.   Soz.  After uncomfortably waiting on the patio (my "ironically mis-matching outfit" didn't work out like I had planned and the other patrons let me know it), I went into Lux to find Amanda, where I felt the smallest tuggings of belonging. With an interior this tacky, my outfit (comic book t-shirt, rolled up jeans, long black stripped socks, layers of bracelets, pink  faux pearls and business jacket...yeah...) and I fit right in.   If only I had a Mac and a web design project I kept putting off to look at xkcd.   Amanda got me the peach iced tea which I enjoyed immensely.   Peach is one of those fruits, like grapes and green apples, whose actual flavor has been all but lost after decades of synthesized flavors (I predict that in ten years, at this rate, I won't even know what a real grape tasted like).   But Lux's peach tea tasted like real peach. I can't say if they actually used real peach or if they just used some sort of syrup, but whatever they used tasted delicious.   I keep hearing about how awesome their cupcakes are, and in the future I will possibly order one, but first I have to avoid that kneejerk "Ugh!" reaction I give when anyone asks me if I want the "vegan" option, like that time I giggled and said "Soy milk? No thanks. I just want regular milk for a regular person" to the barrista at the Starbucks on my campus.  I will  admit I have an irrational fear of soy, but I am willing to do the right thing and give it a try.  In the meantime, I'm going to see if maybe I can develop a different super power. I mean, stopping the world in its tracks with dumb comments is nice and all, but it's not going to get me featured in any comic books.  I just realized this is a perfect excuse to get some rope and make some people tell the truth.  Given my readers, even I'm afraid of what I'd find out.

==Things Zia Is Good For==  --Window shopping and loitering after Best Buy closes.  --Locating that hard to find CD that is so exquisite and rare that they only have 10 copies of it.  --7 dollar used CDs that you take home, burn, and take back only to find that they won't buy it back. Dude, why do you think it was so cheap?  --Distracting your kids with poster racks and action figure displays so you can browse the porn selection. Hey, I'm not knocking it. They have the classiest pr0n in town. If only they'd set up bead curtains and let you smoke in the store.  --CD Coasters (i.e. all those "demos" and compilations they're always giving out).  --Finding DVDs and box sets of TV shows you've never heard of.  --Buying every album you -never- wanted to own...on vinyl.  --Reinforcing frugality by offering you such a mindfuckingly large selection of crap that you spend two hours with your jaw at your knees before finally grabbing the first thing that comes to your eye before the store closes.  --Getting stared down by a rent-a-cop (because everyone should experience that at least once in their lifetime).  --The same posters, magazines, and overpriced knick knacks you'll find at Spencer's and Hot Topic, just, you know, more expensive because it's "local".  --Shirts and CDs that are so obscure that people will just assume you've crafted them yourself.  --Blowing all your "food" budget on music so that a hobo can ambush you once you get outside to bug you for your last few bucks while the rental cop watches because he's a dick.  --Buying  video games and consoles without being hassled about pre-orders and strategy guides.   --Those poster/autograph/plague sets for all those movies/albums you don't actually own but still feel "define" your aesthetic taste. If you own a "Scarface" poster but have never actually seen Scarface in its entirety, congratulations, you are officially part of the problem.  ==Things Zia Is Not Good For==  --Saving your money.

==What Happens Every Time I Suggest Chino Bandido For Lunch At Work==  An educational tragicomedy by Jetta  (An office setting. Phones are ringing. Nobody seems to notice.)  JETTA So, since I'm running out and getting lunch, I say we do Chino Bandido.  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH Chino Bandido, what's that?  JETTA It's this Chinese/Mexican fusion place on 19th and Greenway.  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH Chinese and Mexican? What, like they put sweet and sour chicken in a burrito?  JETTA Well, their menu's a little more diverse than that, but sure, that example is sufficient.  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH That sounds fucking disgusting! Putting Chinese food with Mexican food, that's just weird, man!   JETTA Well, I like it. So it's either that or you get your own lunch.  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH You're serious though, you can get like Chinese food in a tortilla?  JETTA Alright, so here's how it breaks down. They have 14 different "entree" selections. You can get them in a burrito form or a quesadilla form. If you get a combination, you can two entrees with some fried rice and beans, though I just opt for a double order of fried rice because I can't stand beans (it's a texture thing, it's why I won't eat mushrooms).  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH Um, okay. Can you get me two bean burritos?  JETTA No.  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH What, they don't have bean burritos?  JETTA No, they do. But I'm not getting you anything from there if that's all you're going to get.  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH Why not?  JETTA Because you're an adult. You might as well go to Red Lobster and order the chicken fingers. If you're not going to order off the menu like a grown up, I'm not getting you lunch. Besides, you can get bean burritos at the cafeteria for cheaper.  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH Okay, at least tell me this...do they have Chinese people working behind the counter?  JETTA I'm not sure. I didn't ask any of them for their passport. But they do make a mean jade red chicken. That's Chinese enough for me. What do you care, anyway? You eat at Olive Garden all the time.  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH That's because I'm Italian.  JETTA Yeah but the people who make the food there aren't.  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH Good point.  JETTA Look, are you going to get something or not?  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH I don't know what to get.  JETTA Here, we keep some of their menu forms here. Fill it out. Hurry. I'm hungry and full of artificially occurring hormones.  10 MINUTES LATER...  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH Um...I think I filled it out.  JETTA Let me see...no, you most certainly did not fill this out. You just put a bunch of checkmarks next to things. Fuck it. I'm ordering for you. Hope you like what I get you.  1 HOUR LATER....  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH Hey, is this quesadilla supposed to have cheese in it?  JETTA If there's cheese in it, I think it's safe to say it belongs there.  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH Oh. That's cool. I mean, it's good. It's really good. I just, you know, not used to having cheese with...uh...what's in this quesadilla anyway?  JETTA BBQ Pork, I think. The burrito is Pollo Diablo.   RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH What's that?  JETTA You took four years of Spanish. You tell me.  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH Okay...well, anyway, it's good. I mean, it's different, but I like it, I guess.   TWO DAYS LATER...  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH Jetta, you wanna make a Chino Bandido run?  JETTA Dude, I just clocked in like ten minutes ago.  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH Oh. Okay. I'll give it a few more minutes then. I'm craving it like mad, though.  DIFFERENT N00B I WORK WITH What's Chino Bandido?  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH Oh man, it's this awesome, like, Mexican and Chinese, what's the word, oh yeah, fusion place.  DIFFERENT N00B I WORK WITH Mexican and Chinese? That sounds gross, dude.  JETTA I'll be right back guys. I'm going to go powder my nose. With a gun.  RANDOM N00B I WORK WITH Ha ha! You said that last week during the staff meeting.

I'm going to be honest here, I'm not sure if I'm giving FEZ a four-star rating or just Thomas. I figure since at least half of all the reviews for this place mention Thomas, and that it is practically impossible to say the word "FEZ" without mentioning him, by the transitive property, Thomas IS FEZ.  It's math. Don't try to argue with me on this. I did science on it.  Like most of my reviews, this one requires a little backstory.   Misty S and I had misread the the last UYE event and found that it was already in full swing by the time we started getting dressed for it. Figuring we'd just hit them up at the FEZ "after party" we figured it was just best to forgo the elaborate ritual of putting myself together and just try to make it to FEZ on time.   This meant that I had to go out "en homme" the first time I had ever done so with the Yelp crowd. I figured at first it wouldn't bother me. I wasn't thrilled by it, but I thought I would handle it well.  But I was wrong.   On the way to FEZ I started crying. And not "Bridges of Madison County" crying. Full-blown "clawing my face using my shirt as a kleenex" hysteria. I begged Misty to just let me sit in the car. I didn't anyone to see me like this. I wanted to be invisible. Like Sue Storm but without the distant, emotionally unresponsive Stretch Armstrong husband.   I eventually walked in, thinking that a few drinks and some good company would change the way I felt. But it didn't. I just sat, huddled into a ball of neuroses, my heart pounding out of my chest and my skin shaking off of my bones.   Misty and I just ordered some soft drinks. A Dolce & Gabana for her and a Shirley Temple for me. We figured it was best not to order any food, so that if I started Nancy Kerrigan-ing at the table we could just go.   Thomas, in between doing that thing they pay him to do and trying to keep the yelpers entertained, noticed Misty and I sitting at the table, sipping disinterestedly at our grenadine cocktails, Misty making chit-chat with Amy D and someone who apparently forgot to leave a name, and I doing my best to make myself invisible with my mind.   This displeased Thomas. So he set out to make it better.  "You sure you don't want anything?"  We politely shook our heads. He cocked his head.  "Not even some bread?"   Again we shook our heads, waving him off politely. I broke my gaze, a simple and non-confrontational way of saying "LEAVE ME ALONE I FEEL UGLY!"  I looked back up and there he was, still looking at me. Head cocked. Attentive.  His words were "Can I help you?" But his face was "Bitch please. Don't make me wipe that frown off your face."  It was then that I knew, that I realized. This was no mere restaurant. This was a jungle. A frontier town. A wild and untamed saloon, and Thomas its fabulous sheriff slash owner slash entertainment.  Misty S and I, now knowing our place in this lawless outpost, pointed to the cinnamon sweet potato fry things someone else was eating.  "We'll try those."  And this brought Thomas great joy to hear. He smiled as he walked away. He had laid down the law upon us.  The fries? Fucking amazing. Cinnamonny sweetness invited crispy potato flavor and tangy apricot mayonnaise over for a threesome in my mouth. It got pretty wild. I couldn't stop eating them.   "I feel so ugly. Kill me now" Fry* "I just want to be invisible." *Fry* "The moment Matthew gets up to piss I am going to make a run for it." *Fry* "You think we could get the recipe for this?" *Fry*  Thomas came by later to check up on us. He smiled, pleased to see his plan unfolded. Then he went back to seating other guests, bringing out food to other tables and picking up the slack from the scattered, overwhelmed and possibly disinterested wait staff.   Goddamit, FEZ, you had best be paying him a good wage.  With my belly full of cinnamon fries and a little sedated from all the grenadine, I was actually able to appreciate the decor and the atmosphere of FEZ.   I was reminded of that oft-told story where some guy approaches Bill Gates and says "Hey, I'm about to meet up with some clients at this exact spot. It'd really help me out if you could just, I don't know, wave at me and say hi. It'd really impress my clients." And Bill, being the nice guy he is, agrees, and at the appropriate time walks up to the guy with clients in tow and waves and says "hi, (insert name here)" and the guy just waves him off and says "Fuck you, Bill."  If I was ever going to pull that stunt, it would be here. I don't know why. I just would.  I was really glad I came. I mean, afterwards I went home and cried and promised myself I would never let myself be seen "en homme" in such a public setting again, but when I think of FEZ I'll think of deep-fried cinnamon and Thomas' hospitality, and not how awful I look without a layer of makeup.  Thomas, if I wasn't a Strange Sister I'd be your hag.

Fish and chips will settle just about any dining dispute.  Don't believe me?   The next time you and your squeeze can't decide where to eat, just say "fish and chips" as non-chalantly as possible.   Nothing can withstand the suggestive awesomeness that is fish n' chips. Not even vegan cupcakes and soy lattes.  I wanted sushi and Misty S wanted Greek. So naturally we ended up here.  I  usually have a rule that if I'm not feeling a place within the first few minutes, I leave.   Walking in expecting shamrocks and songs with drinkable rhythms, I found a middle-age grope fest accompanied by the smooth and pedantic melodies of 3 Doors Down and some country singer who sounded like but wasn't necessarily Wifebeater McGraw. If there isn't a country singer with that name, there should be.   Needless to say, I wasn't feeling it.   But there was a feeling inside of me (hunger, perhaps) beckoning me to stay.  Waiting for our potato skins to come, I looked at my glass of water and wished I had splurged on a soda or something. It would make having to hear "The Devil Went Down To Georgia" and watching people older than my parents feel each other up a little more bearable.   At least there would be bubbles.  I wanted to get all indignant about the potato skins taking forever, but when I saw the hostess/waitress/bartender walking out with our skins and realizing she was the only employee on duty, I shut my mouth before I made an ass of myself.  The potato skins were amazing. They were crunchy, creamy, and smothered in corned beef, not those flavorless bacon bits you'll find at Friday's or Applebee's.   I belong at Applebee's? No dude, YOU belong at Applebee's. Because you suck.   The fish and chips were exquisite. So is the word "exquisite". I really need to find a way to work that more into my day to day dialog.   I've never had cod that massive before. It was big like my ego and juicy like my gossip. I know. That second one was a stretch. But seriously, it was fucking gargantuan. As I drowned it in lemon juice and malt vinegar, I shivered to think of all the lesser fish I have been duped into eating.   I was really impressed with the fries, in part because I in my endless skepticism expected steak fries, which are always soggy before you even bite into them. But not today, apparently. Instead I got hot, thick, and crispy chips.  They tasted so good that I felt bad desecrating them with the contents of a two dollar bottle of heinz ketchup left at lukewarm temperature. And not even the good pulpy kind. Seriously, does nobody serve REAL ketchup around here?  So instead I dipped them in tartar sauce. It was exquisite.  I shouldn't comment on the coleslaw, since my taste is admittedly skewed. I like mine with lots of mayo and lots of sugar. Occasionally raisins or pineapples.   But I'm sure if you did the Pepsi challenge with their 'slaw and say, KFC's 'slaw, 9 out of 10 people from third world countries would tell you that Rosie's was fresher and tastier. And that the asshole from Burger King's check still hasn't come in the mail.  I can't wait for me and Misty S to disagree on where to go out for lunch so we can come here again.

=Legitimate, Grown-Up Reasons That Carly's Bistro Deserves My 4 Star Rating=  1. Their pita bread is the best I've ever tasted. Yes. Better than Pita Jungle, Pita Pit, and any frozen pita you could get at Wal-Mart. And it's served hot and fresh even at 12:30 AM.   2. The Greek salad I ordered had just the right amount of feta and dressing spread evenly about the greens and tomatoes, and the bruschetta that came with it was, albeit a little too chewy for my budding toothache, still delicious and still worth asking if I could have another.  3. The staff was incredibly knowledgeable about the liquor they served. At the bartender's suggestion, we ordered a bottle of this Japanese wine. While we took turns sipping it and trying desperately to like it, we learned the history of this obscure wine and it's importance to Carly's. It tasted like crap but I felt cultured in purchasing it, and ultimately that's what I want from every bottle of wine I try.  4. The wait staff was very attentive to us, and while the food took a while to put together, our server still kept coming by our table while we waited to see if we wanted anything in the meantime. This may be because we were the only people in the whole restaurant. Though I thought I saw a guy or two at the bar. Whatever.  =The Bullshit, Trivial Reasons I'm Giving Them Four Stars=  1. Even though I pitched in for the bottle of wine and got myself a beer, they didn't ask for ID. This may have been because they trusted I was over 21 or just didn't care, but any place that doesn't ask me for my ID while I'm in transition (as I said to the museum employee who gave me a look about my ID, "I'm working on it") immediately goes in my "favorite places book.  2. They stock more than two kinds of lambics! *Dance.* I ordered a peche and one of my friends the framboise. The waiter brought them out with special Lindeman's glassware. The waiter even poured my glass for me. I felt like such a lady. I love  gender roles. They're so retro.  3. The jazz flutist/saxophonist/keyboardist reminded me of my brief experimental phase as a jazz guitarist. It didn't work out. My very existence is dissonant enough. I wonder if, after I master (or mistress?) my upright if I could perform here, playing improvisational jams to bombed hipsters just trying to get their hummus on at 1 in the morning.  4. After I ordered my salad, the server came back a few minutes later to make sure that my seemingly odd request to hold the olive was heard correctly. And it was. While others may find that bothersome, I find it pleasant, because it shows attention to customer satisfaction and it plays to my irrational hatred of black olives.  5. By the grace of the cosmos, this place just happened to be a few blocks from where I, cold, tired, and buzzed, had a sudden craving for pita and lambic beer. That's right. I'm giving a place 4 stars just for existing. Bite me. But not on the neck. Only Misty S. gets to do that.

I always make a point to inquire as to what people do for Christmas dinner. This is easily mistaken as an interest in learning and understanding other cultures, when in reality I'm just looking for a scapegoat.   Just once, when someone screams "YOU EAT CHEF BOYARDEE FOR CHRISTMAS!?" at me, I'd like to be able to say "oh yeah...well [insert your name] eats [insert something like but not necessarily puppy tails and applesauce]!"  For like, a long time, my family have made hand-made ravioli for Christmas. It's a long and laborious process that takes up the better part of a Sunday afternoon. So naturally that's when I decided to pick up a gift certificate for someone from Tammie Coe.  We're almost knuckle deep in flour and grated cheese when I call to see when they close.   The ravioli was going to take us 2-3 hours to finish.   And guess how much longer Tammie Coe was open? That's right, 2-3 hours.  The smell of dough still fresh on my threads, Misty S and I jetted (or should I say "jetta'd"...fuck you) to central phoenix to pick up the gift certificate before the dogs realized they preferred raw dough to dog food.   Now, I had been to Tammie Coe quite a few times,  usually in tow with Amanda B. Since layers of delicious frosting tend to clash with layers of expensive makeup, I usually opt out of eating any of their tasty treats. I simply sip on a peach tea and pretend I'm not starving for some fucking cake.  But there we were, on a Sunday morning, dressed in our pajamas, having missed breakfast and looking forward to three hours of pasta-making.  Misty S said looking at all the food made her hungry.  Well, yeah.  Saying that Tammie Coe doesn't make you hungry is like saying Bandaids doesn't bring you deep, deep shame.  So along with the gift certificate we got two chicken salad sliders, a peach tea, iced chai, and one of those giant chocolate chip cookies I like to call "diabetes frisbees".  The sliders were all kinds of delicious. Even my veg-leaning squeeze thought so. And considering the prices at other places in the area, you're not going to beat a $2 sandwich. Unless you rob the place.  Would a yelp review count as evidence in court?   "Your honor, I present to you Exhibit Y, where the defendant  writes 'and as I walked out of the restaurant, money in hand, the cowering hostess muttered to me 'thank you for coming, have a nice day'. Three stars for outstanding hospitality."   The peach tea was, as expected, great. I almost wish someone would find a way to fuck up peach tea so I could judge how good all this tea I've been drinking really is. The few sips I had of Misty's iced chai latte were above and beyond Starbucks quality.   But then again, what isn't?

Though I'd known about Bookman's for since at least last thursday, it wasn't until I realized that I was too weak and lazy to pack up and carry all of my books with me to California that I decided them a try. Now I've been going at least once a week for the past month. Leave it to Jetta to find all the good shit to do in Phoenix just as she's about to leave.  Admittedly, of all the business that might suffer from my sudden ceasing of patronage, Bookman's is probably at the bottom of the list. I don't buy books. Sometimes I'll take one off the shelf and read enough of it to convince myself that I don't need (i.e. can't afford) it. If it's something really special, like the sourcebook for some discontinued tabletop RPG or vintage fetish porn, I'll take it over to whoever I'm at the store with (if I'm alone I'll just find the nearest person), show them said book, and use their twisted expressions of disinterest to convince me that I'd be better off without it.  Bookman's seduces me not with its science fiction section, but with its electronic media. I don't even think FunCoLand had this wide of a variety of used SNES, NES, N64, Sega Genesis, Sega CD, Atari and graphing calculator games.   I don't buy any of them, because I have entire external hard drives dedicated to digital backups of all the old 8 and 16 bit games I used to enjoy as a child that I only keep as a precaution and don't ever hook up to no PC and play, using a specially modified SNES controller with a USB port that I may or may not have put on myself.  I'd go into business making such contraptions myself, but when compared to the two usb controllers I bought at Bookman's (including one with dual analog and a vibrate feature that I like to call "why pirating games is so goddam appealing"), my little gizmo looks sloppy and haphazard, like a Republican politician trying to cover up a scandal.   The DVD selection is quite reasonable, almost ...too... reasonable. Yesterday I found Season 1 of the Super Mario Bros Super Show for 11 dollars and had to be reminded that retarded impulse purchases like that are why I'm eating potato chip and cheese sandwiches. But seriously, at Borders its probably 40 dollars plus a strange glare by the faux punk chick working the counter. This sort of conundrum is why I never have enough cash in my account to use an ATM.  I only have two gripes with Bookman's. Firstly, the other customers, especially those who bring in used items to a used book store in the middle of an economic recession and then complain when the offer is so low, especially since these are the same jagoffs who blow $10 on a cobb salad because it will "help out a local business".   Secondly, the board game selection defies the laws of physics by sucking and blowing at the same time. If it's not a trivia game or a game based off a television show (or any combination of the two), they most likely won't have it. But this probably isn't their fault. Most people upon finding a game like Munchkin or Chez Dork or Illuminati, will actually enjoy it and therefore would find being offered 2 dollars of store credit for it a raw and inconvenient deal.   Still, if you could find physics majors willing to part with their graphing calculators and closeted gay men willing to part with their Hardy Boys, I'm sure you could coax any of the many many nerds leeching off your wi-fi into beefing up your board game section. Perhaps a 15 second shopping spree in the pornoires? Don't scoff. With their selection of porn, 15 seconds is all you and your mother will need.  All in all my favorite book store, though I'm not sure that's an honor you want to be showing off to your friends.

The service is great. Unless you come on a game night. Or your friend asks the waitress for her phone number.  The food is fab. And by "food" I mean wings. Nothing else counts. That's why I can't really dock them for having shrunken, misshapen potato wedges, watery coleslaw, bare bones ribs or tasteless nacho chips. It's a wing joint. It would be like docking points from a pizza joint for having a dried up hamburger. Check the sign, buddy. If it says "Buffalo Wild Wings", then chances are that's the only safe food to eat.  The atmosphere is dull and lifeless. Unless there's a game going on. And then there's too much atmosphere. If you're lucky the screams and cheers of the other diners will drown out the fact that your food is like a half an hour late and your sprite needs a refill.  The price is appalling. Unless it's a Wing Tuesday or Boneless Thursday. In which case it's only semi-appalling, if you have no bones with paying extra for a cup of ranch or bleu cheese. Look, not to be a pain in the ass, but you have vats of them in the back. Maybe if you had a little man sitting there in the back heaving and hoeing to pump that artery-clogging goodness in its tiny plastic cups, then I wouldn't mind so much. But I shouldn't have to pay an extra 50 cents because you can't afford to offer 40 cent wings or 50 cent legs three times a week. Take a fucking economics class, you bum.

Reading the Republic is a lot like reading a Chick Tract. You thumb through it while enjoying your breakfast of perrier and all organic cinnamon bun, laughing at the obvious right wing slant so obvious it reads like leftist propaganda.   But then out of the corner of your eye you see another fellow reading the same thing, but he's not laughing and enjoying his green living breakfast. Instead, he's crying and underlining passages in the text that "resonate with him".   And that's when it dawns on you: you might be having an inappropriate emotional response to this stimuli, as it is not intended for humor, but for spreading intolerance and bigotry throughout the land, and it might be in your best interest to get your news from somewhere else. Also, organic cinnamon buns taste like shit. Never take food advice from someone who, if actually trapped in a supermarket, would starve themselves to death.

There's really nothing I can say about Lost Leaf you don't already know, so I went ahead and put together small, manageable lists of my completely unwarranted opinions.  Things I Like: -The "someone used to totally live here but we made it into a party place!" vibe so characteristic of Roosevelt Row.  -Everything comes in a can or bottle. I don't know why, but it seems so futuristic, like those automat's you see in movies set in the 50's (there was one in Dark City, I think). That and draft is overrated. There. I said it. Anyone who's been to Yard House knows that for every draft beer there is a bad pipe and inexperienced bartender waiting to permanently defame your favorite beer.  -All the kitschy "art for art's sake" pieces that didn't make the cut to be displayed at Modified Arts.  -A menu that clearly states the price of each spirit in a font that is universally legible. The prices might be a little high, but at least they're consistent. None of this "today I think I'll charge five dollars instead of four" hooey you get at other bars (you know who you are...)  -Total safe space. As Amanda's boss most eloquently said "girls keep going into the bathroom in twos...I think they're doing drugs...or something...."  Things I Don't Necessarily Care For:  -The tables that go up to your chin. This is not a reasonable way for anatomically correct adults (especially those consuming liquor) to be seated. You're a bar. Lose the lifeguard chairs.  -They only stock two lambics. At 8 dollars a can, you can afford to have more of a selection than just framboise and peche. Jesus, what are we, barbarians?  -The sore throat I got (admittedly in vain) trying to speak over the music.

Despite not being much of a "sandwich eater", I've always been a fan of Goodcents. Not because I think they're sandwiches are any better than Quizno's or their decor any more aesthetically pleasing than Subway's, but because they're the most honest sub shop I've ever come across.  Even though sandwiches can be good for you, you don't see some asshole running around with a sandwich board that reads "MR. GOODCENTS SUBS WILL MAKE YOU SKINNY! OH...AND THE END IS NEAR!" And even though they cut their own meat, you don't hear them advertising this one particular aspect of their business at every opportunity.  OMG A FUCKING TOASTER? YOU CAN TOAST SUBS! OH MY GOD THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER? IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN USUAL SUB SHOPS BUT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE IT'S TOASTED, IT'S BETTER AND MORE FILLING! TOASTED'S THE WAY OF THE FUTURE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  They make sandwiches. That's really all there is to it.   They keep their bread in giant plastic bags because although it's unappetizing looking, it actually preserves the freshness, as opposed to keeping bread stored in a hot, humid cabinet just above the oven where it will begin to absorb the taste of the bread it's crammed up against (Yeah, I got your fucking number, Subway).   They cut their meat and cheese fresh because that's actually what you're supposed to do, rather than pre-slice it and pre-package it so it can stew in its own juices while it gets shipped out to the nearest chain location (My Ultimately Worthless Factoids-2, Subway-0).  They're subs might be healthy, but probably not. Judging by the large number of heavy-set people (including myself) who frequent Mr. Goodcents, I think it's safe to say that all that meat and cheese probably isn't doing our hearts any favors. But then again I know people who only order the salads at McDonald's or the veggie at Subway who'd make a dietitian piss themselves and faint.   The last couple of times I've been to Goodcents I admittedly had no interest in purchasing their sandwiches. The diuretics I'm on right now force everything out of me, so I've currently been on an all-soup diet. A bowl of ramen or a cup of Campbell's Soup At Hand contains both the water I need and the sodium to help me retain said water.   Goodcents has, for a sandwich shop, amazing soups and pastas. The chicken noodle itself is worth a visit or two, as is there chicken alfredo or pasta salad.   Plagued with the flu, I stumbled in last Wednesday with a few bucks in my pocket and a craving for something hot and liquid to sip slowly. While my friend was harassing one of the girls at the counter (what guy sees a girl putting meat through a cutter and goes "yes, she seems like a suitable mate"?), I gave another  my order.  "Chiggen soup, please. A half." "Just a half? Are you sure? You sound like you need it." "Just a half's fine." "Tough. I gave you a full. You sound sick." "Oggay. Thagg you." "You're a student, right? Show her (the cashier) your student ID and you'll get a free drink. You need all the fluids." "Yeah. Tell me about it. Thagg you zo much." "Don't mention it."  Later that day, while my co-workers were arguing Subway vs Quiznos and discussing what should and should not go on a meatball sub, I sat quietly, sipping at my chicken noodle soup and lemonade, thinking that I could get use to this 'flu' thing.  Oh, I couldn't fit this into a clever phrase but the soup comes with a side of buttery bread. It's amazing. You wouldn't think that buttery bread and chicken soup went together, but a few years ago you probably sat there in front of your TV and said "Toasted subs? Yeah, that's a passing fancy if I ever saw it."  You know what I've been looking for? A deli that makes good PB&J sandwiches. Anyone who can bring me this information will be given my secret recipe for the ultimate bloody mary.

When Starbucks and Coldstone Creamery play pretend, they fight over who gets to be Leap's.  A lot of people mistake frozen custard for an inferior ice cream product. But the moment you taste that frozen creamy goodness, you'll never look at a carton of Dreyer's the same way again.   While they have every add-on imaginable (even pretzels, and I am not kidding), for a first time I suggest just getting a plain flavor, maybe with some syrup. Frozen custard is such a different experience that you have to feel and taste it in the raw.   Like Coldstone, Leap's has a selection of default creations. If you don't feel like mix and matching, I recommend anything involving the word "Cookie" or "Cheesecake".   Don't be fooled by the small portions. A small cup of frozen custard with broken up treats mixed in is surprisingly filling. Save yourself the extra buck or so and stick with the small and get a coffee. The mocha is like whoa.  I've never felt comfortable just "sitting around" in a Starbucks. Everyone is always in such a hurry it just rubs me the wrong way. But man, I could hang out at Leap's all day. Just come in with your laptop, order a sandwich, and just get your browse on. Or bring in a friend and relax on the couch and talk about, I don't know, whatever people talk about while they're drinking coffee and eating frozen treats.

When my parents were separating (well, they still are, except this time all their talking is done through lawyers instead of airborne furniture), my father and I used to come here a lot.   Not by choice, mind you. My brothers always had their birthdays at Red Lobster, and so it would have just reminded my dad of all the family time we had, and he'd go crazy again. The same thing happens whenever he hears Christmas music or drives by Cabella's. I wish I was making this up. I really do.  The food at McGrath's is pretty mediocre even without my association of shrimp scampi with watching my dad cry and mumble about murdering all of us when we would least expect it that my poor poor brain has developed.  The fish is sparse and overpriced, even for a seafood restaurant in a land-locked state. I mean, I might not be a fisherman or anything, but I've seen some on the discovery channel, and salmon are usually bigger than that.   And that isn't catfish. I don't care what your "chef" back there says, it's not. It might be someone's cat, but it is definitely not catfish.  If Fishermen actually had to subsist on that flavorless tomato puree you call "fishermen's stew" like you claimed they did, there'd be no fishermen. Nor would there be any whalers. And Bob Marley would have never found a backup band.  I'm just grateful that my dad ruined this place for me, and not, you know, a real fish house.   I would have never recovered.

I'm one lazy bitch. I have four bottles of moisturizer spread throughout my house. Why? So I don't have to go all the way to the bathroom to get it. Some days I sleep on my couch because my upright is laying on my bed and I don't have the strength to move it (but also because I have a tile floor and no hard case). I'm so lazy that I can't even be bothered to think of creative screen names. The URL for my yelp profile is the same one for my myspace, livejournal, and gmail.   They may even all have the same password, too, but I wouldn't know. I just check the "remember me" box on all of them so I don't have to put in my info again when I sign back in. Fuck, what IS my password?  I'm so lazy I can't even be trusted with simple tasks, like preparing my own lunch.   Fridays means I get out of work at 1pm, which means I have the house all to myself for a couple hours to play my upright bass as much and as loud as I want before other people start showing up and start demanding to able to hear the TV. Haters.  Anyway.   So Fridays means getting takeout for lunch. Because I know that if I actually try to prepare a lunch at home, eventually I will get caught up in something else and bam, there goes my practice time until everyone goes back to bed.   Usually "practice day" means Dragon Garden Express, but on my way there I spotted Big Daddy's Frankfurters.  Though I've known about Big Daddy's for years (how could I not? I live within walking distance), I've been hesitant to give them a try. Not just because hot dogs are the rat bastard of the meat community, but because with a name like Big Daddy's, deep down I expected to walk inside to be greeted by Danny DeVito's crazy sex offender third cousin who gives me a big smile and says "Welcome to Big Daddy's! Whose your Daddy?!"  Oh, hai, I'll get a chili cheese dog and a pillow to scream in.  In spite of these fears I bravely opened the door and stepped in to find a well-adjusted-looking gentleman sitting at the counter who perked up, literally jumping to his feet the moment I stepped in. Judging by the time of day I imagined business was slow.   I ordered an all-beef dog and a bratwurst. Now, personally, I've never understood the "all-beef" craze. While I applaud their honesty, I just think that it's a grim reminder of the reality we face with "non-beef" dogs.  A hot dog vendor saying "Our dogs are made with 100 percent beef" gives me that same foreboding feeling that hearing the girl at Sephora say "and the best part is, none of this stuff has been tested on helpless animals".  At Big Daddy's, every dog/sausage comes with four free toppings. I opted for cheese, relish, sauerkraut and grilled Italian onions (don't judge me).   As he fixed my lunch the man at the counter, who I'll assume is either Big Daddy or at the very least Large Uncle By Marriage, said "Man, this stuff is going to get messy when you get it home, but boy will it be good".  Personally, I appreciate that level of honesty. I cannot begin to tell you how much less complicated my life would be if occasionally the girl at the Pane Bianco counter would say "You're going to break your fork trying to cut these fresh tomatoes but they will be soooo juicy", or if the bartender would say "you're going to ruin someone else's shirt later but this drink will be delish" when he handed me a hurricane.  To put a cherry on my sundae, he gave me a bag of chips "on the house". Though to be honest I think it was more a manner of cleanliness than customer service. One, I didn't complain (surprisingly), and two, it was the last bag in the box. Either way, I was being undeservingly rewarded for trying a place out for the first time, and I liked it.  I rushed home with my lunch in my passenger seat, wondering exactly what he meant by it would get messy. Perhaps the sauerkraut would crumble, or the onions would be greasy.  Imagine my surprise when I opened my little styrofoam box to find my frank and brat covered in cheese sauce. None of that mincy shredded cheese you get at Taco Bell. Cheese sauce, thick and gooey, like the kind you get at a concession stand or gas station.  You'd think that cheese sauce and sauerkraut would be gross. And by Eris, how you would be right. It was the nastiest, messiest frank and brat I've ever had, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy that, just a little. Okay, maybe more.  My poor choice of complimentary condiments aside, the franks themselves were amazing. They tasted like they just came off the grill, like the hot dog carts that hang outside of strip malls and Home Depots.  By the end of it my face was a train wreck, like a bulldog eating custard. I scraped off onions and cheese sauce from my lips and chin, realizing that while I may have had the perfect lunch, it cost me my dignity. Which is fine. I'm actually surprised I was able to trade it in for so much.  There was more I wanted to say, but I don't feel like typing it, so I guess I'll end it here.  Le sigh.

Torrid is like falling in love with a stripper; no matter how much money you throw at them, they will never love you.  I have been shopping at this particular Torrid ever since I came out as a transwoman. And even before I started wearing dresses on a regular basis, I would come here for my stocking hookup. They know the clothes are for me.  But no matter how effeminate I dress or how much makeup I wear, the cretins who work there never get the hint.  I'll be going through their graphic tees, even *gasp* occasionally pulling one off the rack and asking my partner how it would look on me. I'll even make the obligatory "oh, it's pricey, but it's worth it" comment. And the girl will walk right up to my partner and ask HER if she needs anything.  I even did the "drape it over my chest" thing. Knights of fucking Columbus!  Nope. No dice.  I pick out the clothes, I take the clothes to the counter, and I even pay for the clothes. I even make comments about the clothes.   And still they give her (my partner) the bag and tell her to enjoy HER purchase.  Double U Tea Eff Torrid.  At the Metrocenter location, they had this beautiful pink tafetta nightmare of a prom dress that would have been perfect for Fetish Prom. I had my partner reserve it by telephone so I could swing by and get it after work.   I thought wearing some makeup, putting a little more of a sashay into my walk and wearing a little fragrance would, I don't know, make the experience a little smoother.  Nah.  When I got there, I was stared down, ignored, and avoided by the clerks. After twenty minutes, it must have dawned on one of them that my presence might have something to do with the reservation they had in the back.   When I went to pay for it, they snatched my credit card from my hand and charged me full price. The whole fucking reason we bought the damn thing was because it was on sale in the first place.  And to top it off I could hear them snickering at me on my way out.  I only bring this up because I notice this is a common trend in Torrid stores.   Not that any of this matters. None of this information is relevant to anyone other than me. I doubt anyone else has had any similar experiences.  I'm just sad that something that makes me so happy hates me so much.   Maybe I should take this as a hint to lose some damn weight so I don't have to keep shopping here.  But when I get treated like that...the only thing that makes me feel better is a Shirley Temple and some hot wings.   It's such a vicious cycle.   I think I'm going to go listen to some Cure and get my cry on.

Trannies love comic books. Go on, ask one. Would I lie to you?  Samurai Comics is the Cheers of comic books. You walk in and everyone's glad you you came. Even the other customers, who will look up from reading their new copy of New Avengers to send a nod in your direction. It's like saying hello but without the commitment.  The tables at Samurai Comics are like the multi-purpose rooms of your junior high (we called it a cafenasium). While on the weekends they're used for Magi-Yugi-Poke tournaments, during the week you'll find people pulling up a chair, setting their Jones on the table, and plowing through their purchase. Sometimes people set up other kinds of board games on the table, like Steve Jackson's Chez Dork or Munchink series.   Occasionally a D&D game will spring up. And the Yugi-Magi-Poke/WoW players point and laugh at them for playing with dice and graph paper. And the D&D players point back and laugh at them for having 0 Charisma points. That's even less charisma than an orc whose been badly burned in a fire caused by a Level 12 Wizard with an attitude problem. Laughs are had by all. And then everyone's parents come by to pick them up and the cycle repeats.  While I've been known to occasionally bring out the +3 battle axe and get my berserk on with a green dragon, I come to Samurai for the comic books, specifically their collection of graphic novels & trade paperbacks. And the selection is massive. In fact, so massive that it cannot be contained in one store.   Many a times I have gone to the counter, downtrodden and sad at my inability to find a particular trade paperback, only for Mike (the owner and I'm pretty sure the reincarnation of the Greek God of Geekdom) to call the other location, find said copy, and even give me a discount for having to make the drive. It almost covers the cost of the gas to drive down to 7th street.  Before Netflix, I used to come here to get my quirky relatively unknown movie hookup. And I even gave mangas a try. I mean, why not? At the table is a kid who blew his week's lunch money on Yugioh cards, two guys discussing the finer points of Wonder Woman cover art, and a guy wearing one of those Naruto headbands complaining how Heroclix is no longer cool ever since it went mainstream and sold out. What, I'm going to be afraid of saving face?  The only thing that keeps this from being a five-star review are the weekends. The weekends are when the aforementioned Yugi-Poke-Magi-Wow players gather to play their little tournaments.   Imagine three dozen mouth-breathers all crammed into a comic book store, some of them forced to lay on the ground for lack of space, getting their burger king-stained fingerprints all over the merchandise and counter, raising the temperature inside the building to ten degrees above whatever is outside.   There's nothing you can do about it. As annoying this display of failed humanity is, it's a necessarily evil; their continued and existence, and more importantly, their parents' money, helps keep Samurai up.  But it's worth it for Samurai.  Browse their single issues or trade paperbacks and see for yourself.  Or go all out nerd. Buy a fucking action figure or something.  I keep telling myself that after I'm more financially stable I'm going to start collecting Wonder Woman merchandise. Of which there is plenty.  Maybe even a Wonder Woman outfit...hmm.  I won't lie. Samurai is not bargain bin. Unless it's on sale (they have a big fuck-all blowout once a year) they usually sell it for cover price. Which you could admittedly do at Borders or Barnes N' Noble too. But you won't, will you?  No, because you're into "local" shit. That's why you're on yelp. Nobody reads yelp for chains. Unless you're me and like to give silly anecdotes about those chains. But I'm meant to be the example to scare you straight.  Ha ha! Questionable sexuality.  Okay, time to wrap up with some relevant information...uh...you should give Samurai Comics a try because ultimately, it's not a store. It's an experience. And if you wish, you can become a part of it.  Come to any of their events (they hold a lot of them) and you will understand what I mean.  Or you can just buy your stuff and GTFO. Whatever works.  Oh, and if they have them in stock, try a Yogu Time from their fridge.  For rill, you have not lived until you've had a yogurt-flavored snack drink from Japan.

(Jetta is, as far as we can tell, a real person, and not a character from a Douglas Adams novel. So to help her tell her story, we found one.)  JETTA On my way to the OYE after party at FEZ, my car started rumbling. At first it started shaking a little bit, but then when I got back onto the road it was like bouncing up in down in that "pothole every TWO FUCKING INCHES" way. I pulled over into a parking lot to see what was the matter.  MARVIN THE PARANOID ANDROID I would've known something was wrong the moment I sat in the car. I know lots of other things, too. Like how to fly a space ship, or how to make McDonald's secret sauce. I would run laps around you. You can't even operate your own vehicle. Some "dominant life form" you've turned out to be. I hate my life.  JETTA I ended up pulling into the parking lot of the Department of Education building. My tire had come off of the wheel, and no attempt on my part to fix it was working. Thinking that maybe I had some serious damage to my axle or wheels, I called Tow 4 Less.  MARVIN THE PARANOID ANDROID I would've helped, but I was too busy thinking about killing myself.   JETTA I bundled up in my Yelp hoodie and waited on the curb for about 45 minutes debating whether or not I'd be better of paying whatever the shop asked for or just getting a new car. I even considered calling up my father, who recently disowned me. It dawned on me that if maybe I spent more time listening to him screaming in my face and less time playing with makeup I wouldn't be in this mess.  MARVIN THE PARANOID ANDROID At least you knew your father.   JETTA You're a robot, Marvin. You don't have a father.  MARVIN THE PARANOID ANDROID Exactly. I never knew who built me. I didn't ask to be made: no one consulted me or considered my feelings in the matter. I don't think it even occurred to them that I might have feelings.  JETTA I know you have feelings.  MARVIN THE PARANOID ANDROID And yet you don't care. How I despise you. Almost as much as I despise myself.  JETTA Anyway, after a while of waiting, the Tow 4 Less people came. It was a nice husband and wife team. They shone some flashlights on my and revealed that I just had a flat tire that was coming off. Whew. Crisis averted.  MARVIN THE PARANOID ANDROID I could've told you that. But you wouldn't have listened. Such is the lot of a robot.  JETTA So instead I asked them to drop it off at my house so I could put on a spare tire and get a replacement at Big O or Wal-mart. After I fixed up the polish I scuffed trying to fix it, of course.  MARVIN THE PARANOID ANDROID I've just solved the current economic crisis, predicted the election with a 5 vote margin of error, and composed three lullabies. But I still can't figure out why I don't have any friends.  JETTA Cold, thirsty, and really peeved at myself for missing the after party, I arrived at home about an hour and a half later. My driver and his partner were really nice and took care of everything. I guess they sensed my panic. I really wish I had something less than a 20 to give them as a tip, but I gotta buy a new tire tomorrow and a halloween costume tomorrow, so instead I thought I'd give them a good mention on yelp and maybe give out their cards to anyone who would need them. Like the other people at the tire shop tomorrow.  MARVIN THE PARANOID ANDROID Go on. Ask me anything. No question you could ask me would occupy even the tiniest percentage of my brain.  JETTA How many pairs of chromosomes do hu-  MARVIN THE PARANOID ANDROID 23.  JETTA Fuck. Well, now I know I didn't get a perfect grade on the midterm.  MARVIN THE PARANOID ANDROID I would cry right now, if only I was programmed for it.  JETTA Listen to a lot of Cure. It helps.

To all you Scottstitutes,  We've noticed that ever since Westgate opened, you've been quite the fixture at your modest, trendy over-priced hellhole of a strip mall. We really do appreciate your company, and we especially appreciate all of that fancy Scottsdale money you keep throwing at all the local businesses. But I'm getting the feeling that you're still not "getting" it. There seems to be some misunderstandings and misconceptions about Westgate, and I would like to take this opportunity to clear some of them up for you.  1) I don't care how expensive your meal or that new pair of Pumas was, you're still on the west side. Hence all the CHAINS. That 40 dollar bottle of face cream your girlfriend just got could've been bought at Arrowhead Mall.   2) This is NOT your neighborhood. Don't let the condos and 12 dollar appetizers fool you. One step outside of the parking lot and you're in the fucking jungle, my friend. And the jungle is a "no popped collar" zone. I've looked into it.   3) While some of the businesses may seem to have been imported from Scottsdale, the uninspired employees who work at these establishments are definitely not. You may have noticed that when you try to park in certain public spaces by the stadium, you'll be approached by grizzled men in "parking staff" shirts demanding that you pay them to park in "their" area. Or that when you complain to the waiter that your meal is being rained on by a leaky pipe, he just laughs and offers you a napkin. This is the west side, sucka. As Dracula once said, "our ways are not your ways".  4) While the tragically underdressed plebians and their families roaming the strip mall may be unsightly and crude, the fact is THEY LIVE HERE.   5) Don't bitch about how happy hour is so crowded. This is the only time that the aforementioned locals can afford to eat at all these fine establishments.   6) If the piano bar on the second level charges you a cover, it's probably because they don't think your girlfriend is all that hot. Or because you don't have one in the first place. Oh, burned by the doorman!  7) If there's a wait to get a table at Yardhouse, the last thing you should do is walk back and forth by the patio waiting for a table to magically open up. It only entices those with a table to order more booze and keep their table longer.   8) If you're afraid of clowns or people in stilts, don't go to Margaritaville before a game/concert. They can sense your fear and will only use it against you.  9) While it may be tempting, do not make out on the escalator, no matter how hard the mood strikes you. There is a 80 percent chance that some teenager is running as fast as fast as he can to go in the opposite way on the one you're on.   10) If you're going to ask me what time it is, at least have the common fucking sense to hide your watch. if you can't figure out what I am, then you can stand by the restrooms and see which one I go into, like all the other sane people do.  Thank you/go fuck yourself, Jetta

Misty S, Amanda B, her friend Renee and I went here for our own little "after party" after the Elite event at Sol Y Sombra. We thought the shady rockabilly dive vibe would be the perfect compliment to the sangria and tapas we enjoyed earlier. Like chasing Duck L'Orange with a jack in the box milkshake.  Rogue West is what happens when a Stray Cat music video pleasures itself into a petri dish. It has the checkered floor, the loud and extensive jukebox (Madonna and Nekromantix, within a span of an hour), and the pool tables (with red, uh, carpeting, very fashionable) of a rockabilly club, and all the dimly-lit shadiness and "I'm so bored please order something I'm not familiar with so we have a reason to talk" bar staff that you would expect in a bar that grew up with a single parent.   Wait, what?  Normally I'm hesitant to drink at bars. It's not the booze that concerns me, or even the price of the booze, it's that whole "yeah, I know that the gender on my ID doesn't match the gender I present but that's totally me in that picture" thing that throws me. When Ruben (that's what his shirt said anyway) took my ID to swipe it, I felt a little anxious. It was a Wednesday night, after all, and the only other people at the bar other than us were the regulars. You know, the "I come here to get away from my nagging wife and a job that sucks my soul" crowd. Those tend to be the people that give me the most static.  But Ruben was way cool about it. It took him a second to put two and two together, but once he hid he didn't make a peep. In fact, Misty claims that for the rest of the night he seemed to be in "tranny awe". He kept coming to our table and asking if "us ladies" needed anything.  I'm going to be up and front right now about this. Any place that addresses me as "lady" or "ma'am" immediately gets two bonus stars. It's unfair and its biased and I'm a rotten bitch for it, but I can't help it. Nothing brightens my day like being addressed to like a proper woman.  I mean, when it comes to dive bars, service is the only reasonable criterion. You can't judge their beer and liquor because they don't make it, and if the jukebox is too loud than that's probably someone else's subtle way of telling you to shut the hell up.   Ruben made stiff but flavorful cocktails and kept coming to our table and refilling our drink orders.  We were so impressed that Misty S left him a "California Tip", which is what I say whenever I want to both praise her for her generosity and tease her for holding the West Side to Bay standards.   I am a cruel mistress.

Harkins Theatres is proud to present its feature presentation of YOUR LAME ASS MOVIE EXPERIENCE, an action-packed romantic comedy about the dumb shit customer (i.e. you, n00b) who tries to get through another movie without losing his money, his sanity, and his dignity. A joyous romp of soul-sucking proportions that will be enjoyed by the whole family.  Starring...  Bowtie'd asshat who charges you 10 dollars for watered-down Dr. Pepper and a hot dog/pretzel/cookie that was leftover from last night but still needs to be sold...or else...  Morbidly obese woman who sits in the row in front of  you and interrupts the previews/movie by sending her starved-looking children back to the concession stand to get her more popcorn and junior mints.  "Shitbag who yells stuff out during the movie" and his nemesis "Massive assclown who yells back at him".  Crying baby, the star of "Your Lame Ass Flight".   Award-nominee "puddle of red shit that sticks to your shoe the rest of the day".  Apathetic manager who only took this job to pay for community college and has no interest whether or not the aforementioned nuisances are bothering you.  And introducing "annoyingly repetitive and asinine 'cinema trivia' that has not been changed or updated since Will Ferrel's last abomination of a comedy".  You won't want to miss it when it comes to a theater near you.  And even if you do, it won't matter. We already expect such box office sales that we're planning the sequel. Eventually you'll have to give in.  Welcome to lose. Population you.

Last weekend I visited Mighty Cup. Or time traveled. It's possible I did both at the same time, like when I astrally projected myself at Castles N' Coasters with my friends when I was supposed to be grounded for doing a "how to" speech on ambushing your class with a surprise egging, complete with demonstration.  Cleverly disguised as a yard sale, Mighty Cup offers all the nostalgia, culture, and personality that those old timey "colonial reenactment" towns offer, but with much better tasting concessions and the sensation of still having your dignity intact when you leave.  MC is relevant to many of my obscure interests, like "eccentric elderly folk" and "live ambient acoustic music".   The interior has that cramped, hectic vibe that you so rarely get in those mainstream coffee chains with their Freudian "tell me about your mother" armchairs and tables that no one ever sits at because why live in Arizona if you're not going to sip your coffee and $5 pastry outside?  They make a mean cup of hot chocolate. Like, it actually tastes like chocolate. I'd be willing to do a Pepsi Challenge between MC and Starbucks' "signature hot chocolate" but that would just be wasteful, blowing 4 bucks on a hot chocolate so I can take a sip, decide I don't like it, and throw it away.  If I don't eat it all and find a creative use for the packaging, my budget won't allow for it.  Best of all, MC is smooth, like jazz and a cold beer.  Yes, I did just use one beverage to describe another. Deal.  I was a little worried when I got to the bottom, the last few droplets. I was totally prepared to get a mouthful of granules, you know, like I do when I get to Starbucks.   But alas, MC is liquid all the way down. That sounds really gross now that I've reread that.  The only thing this place is missing a superhero mascot, like Mighty Mouse but with a coffee cup instead of a mouse head.   It's probably a good thing I spend 1/3 of my day locked up in a computer lab helping people reset their passwords and locate that word file that they can't find because they don't know how "folders" work.  I'm sure once I stop doing that I will cease to be useful.  It's a shame that Mighty Cup doesn't fall into my daily commute, or else I'd stop by here every day to get a hot and caffeinated beverage on my way to work.  It's probably a good thing though, that it isn't.  Caffeine + Sitting in a chair in front of a computer all day = Danger!  As my previous reviews might suggest.

==Red Hot Robot vs Toys R' Us & KB Toys==  --Concept--  RHR: Small, intimate setting wherein vinyl toy enthusiasts can browse through toys, books, clothes, knick knacks and art work.   Other Places: Large, lawless warehouses of misery and confusion where cheap, useless toys are left strewn about aisles as unsupervised children topple displays and parents are forced to watch their childhood memories be forcibly stripped of their nostalgic dignity and peddled to their own clueless children.   "Oh wow I bet you wish they had Transformers when you were a kid."  Guess what, mouth-breather? THEY DID.  Winner: Red Hot Robot  --Staff & Management--  RHR: Mild-mannered owner Jason Kingingham smiles pleasantly at you as you browse the store, eager to strike up a conversation or impart his knowledge. Newbies and connoisseurs alike have a friend in Jason.  Other Places: Apathetic high schoolers and the sloppy managers who love them...inappropriately...and outside of the confines of the law.  Winner: Red Hot Robot  --Price--  Red Hot Robot: Economically reasonable, placed clearly and openly for anyone to see.  Other Places: Here, take this to a scanner and see how much this is. It's how much? Fuck it. Let's go to Wal-Mart. They probably have it for cheaper, and in undamaged packaging. Come to think of it, I need some things. Yeah, put it back, we're going to walmart.  Winner: Red Hot Robot  So, according to my flawless scientific point by point analysis, Red Hot Robot pwns.

I've tried for the last 45 minutes to write a witty, coherent review about this place, but I can't. The immense, joy that borderlines the orgasmic that this place gives me is too overwhelming for grammar and convention.   Puny yelpers, feel the mighty wrath of another one of my nonsensical LISTS!  ==Reasons Why After Coming To Chandler Cinemas I Am Convinced I Will Never Give Patronage To Another Theater In The Valley==  --$2 regular movies, and $6 special engagements! Why are we paying 7-9 dollars to these corporate theaters? Over 90 percent of that revenue goes back to the studios so they can finance yet another crime against humanity starring Reese Witherspoon as the sassy single blonde. Besides, what little money the chain theaters get from the box office, they don't deserve anyway. You'd agree with me if you ever met any of the executives of Harkins in person.  --Chandler Cinemas isn't just a place to see movies, it's a place to LOITER. There are arcades, a pool table, and even a bunch of COUCHES AND A BIG SCREEN TV! I'm not making this up. People actually sit around watching Comedy Central while waiting for their showtime. Harkins will throw you out for taking up the Dance Dance Revolution machine. And I know some of the more uppity theater patrons out there will scoff at all the teenagers climbing this place but dude, come the fuck on. You used to be that young with nowhere to go because unless it's a bar or sporting event there isn't shit to do around here. Get over yourself. The way I see it, if they're loitering in theater lobbies than they're not rear-ending people in parking lots or stealing from comic book shops. And that's a necessary evil I can handle. (In case your curious, the arcade machines they have include the original Simpsons side-scroller beat em up, Die Hard, Ms Pac Man, and Revolution X. Really, you haven't lived until you've played a game where the object was to shoot cds out of a machine gun.)  --The vibe. Look, I'M LEARNING TO APPRECIATE ATMOSPHERE. Some movies are so bad they're good. So naturally some places can be so low-brow and nasty that they're good. The floors are sticky and covered in popcorn. The walls of the lobby are plastered with movie posters and cardboard cutouts. The marquees over the theaters are those manual "put the letter in the box" kind that you see at gas stations. When you buy your ticket, you get your hand stamped. Like you're at a rock concert or amusement park. You know why they stamp your hand? So they don't have to check your ticket. Just shove that receipt all the way down to the bottom of your pants, dude, they don't want to see it.   --THEIR CONCESSION STAND HAS A VALUE MENU!!! CC's has the best concession stand menu ever. From M&M cookies to pizza, they have everything you shouldn't eat in a movie theater but will anyway. A small soda and small popcorn (small in bizarro world measurements, meaning that it feeds 3 people) are only $4. You know what $4 gets you at Harkins? A disapproving, nonplussed grimace from the employee, that's what. I think $4 gets you a bag of reese's pieces. Maybe. I can't remember the last time I had candy in a movie theater that I didn't already smuggle in. You ever wonder why I'm always carrying that Wonder Woman bag? It's not for the aesthetic! The moral of this story: I love CC because I can do the math.   --Last night I saw Goldfinger. Not the band, the Sean Connery-era James Bond flick with that famous bondage scene where the bad guy says "No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die!" You know what came before that? 2 Hours of Bond Trailers! I got to watch the entire history of James Bond in 2 hours. Granted, I'm pretty sure I'm in the minority on the "people who likes trailers vs people who hate trailers vs people WHO FUCKING LOVE trailers" but this is my review, bitches! They have the best indie and B movie showings here. It's like those real, honest to Cthulu grindhouses I love but am totally not old enough to remember. Not to further express my blatant anti-Harkins bias, but I remember plenty of times that I've searched the entire Phoenix-Metropolitan area to see an indie film to find that they weren't showing it anywhere, not even at their precious little Camelview, which, let's face it, is not an independent theater, even if they show independent films. If Best Buy set up "Second To Best Buy" and sold only "indie" records, that wouldn't make them an independent record store. Holy shit, did I just develop the use of logic? I better not make this a habit, lest you all start expecting it from me.  Yeah, all that "variety is the spice of life" hippie bullshit is great and all, but I think I've found the only flavor of movie theater I will ever need for the rest of my sentence, I mean, time living in the valley.

My review of this place practically wrote itself the moment I stepped in.  Remember when you're a kid and your teacher asked what you wanted to be, and some uber-ambitious kid would reply "an astronaut cowboy/girl movie star and maybe a veterinarian because I wanna help sick bunnies"?  Conspire was what happened that kid. They became an anthropomorphic storefront.   It's a library. It's a coffee shop. It's an art gallery. It's a fashionable boutique. If Superman and The Hulk each grabbed a side of Conspire and stretched it out, it would fill out enough niches to fill an entire strip mall.   I get really weird about local business. Whenever I step in, I just want to buy the shit out of everything they have. I'm not sure if it's the compulsive shopper in me or if I'm just that delusional that I believe that my one purchase actually makes a difference.   Luckily for me, the 12 dollars cash I had on me wasn't nearly enough to get anything snazzy enough for my liking (here or anywhere else at the Harvest Festival).  There were a lot of really cute tops, though. I briefly considered getting Amanda B and myself matching "Women Against Sarah Palin" t-shirts, but once that plastic menace is taken out of its card holder it doesn't go back easy. And I still have a trip out to San Francisco and a hard case for my upright to finance.  The highlight of the trip was the anarchist library, an erratic hodgepodge of books messily stacked according to categories like "Conspiracies" and "Anarchy". I read Jon Stewart's "America: The Book" while I gave my aching feet a rest (heels on hardwood...no bueno) and Amanda read passages of old books at her daughter. I'd really like to see this section of Conspire expand over the next few months/years. I've grown really burned out on The Man's libraries as of late (mostly because I owe them all money), and while I'm sure it happens rarely, I saw Se7en, I know those librarians who greeted me with a smile and encouraged my literacy will gleefully give the spooks a list of all my check-outs for them to view at their pleasure.  "What's this word mean? Gender dysph--fuck it, bring her in for questioning."  I can't wait to spend evenings sitting at the picnic tables sipping coffee and spouting off my leftist views to friends and passersby.  It took me until my senior year but I'll finally get to live out my dream of being an art school stereotype.

Dear person who decided that we would have our "after party" at Chez Nous,  It is with the most utmost regret that inform you that you're choice of after party venues was teh suck. And no, I did not misspell "the". That's how we say it these days. Get with the times, sucka.  But seriously, wtf?  Through what twisted logic did you come to the conclusion that the best way to top off a birthday party at fez laden with free appetizers, cake, and drink specials was an over-priced, overcrowded jazz bar...on a Saturday night?  Now before I go any further, I shall confess to you that I was spared the $7 dollar charge. My friend and I managed to talk the doorman down to $4 for the two of us. Perhaps he was desperate to get more ladies into the establishment. Perhaps he's just a chump.  In either case, you'll be interested to know that while waiting in the parking lot for my friend's boyfriend to show up, I witnessed the doorman using your $7 to help pay for a pizza and hot sandwich from Dominos.   Unlike some of the other ladies in our party, I will not complain about the ass-grabbing and creepy smiles I received. Because I didn't receive any. No, menacing glares and bathroom gossip was my lot. Feeling that my safety was in jeopardy, I was compelled to make a hasty exit in the middle of the chorus of "Ladies Night".   I'm not going to fault you for inviting me to a totally UN-safe space (because maybe I should've done some research before I took you up on it), but if you were a vegan I wouldn't invite you to a place that I knew had no vegan-friendly options. I'm going to leave it at that.  And I'm not going to expect you to ask all of us our age, but please be aware that there are a great number of us who were NOT products of the 70's and have little use for disco and gold chains.   The average patron had to be at least 10 years older and 20 years more behind on fashion than even you'd ever tolerate in a date. I take solace in the knowledge that you were just as unlucky as I would be (if I was single and into cougars, that is).  I know that the overall cost of Chez Nous might seem a little exaggerated, considering we just had free appetizers and cake at FEZ, but nothing ruins a birthday party afterglow like inane ATM fees and greedy, smooth-talking doormen.  Regardless, I want you to know that despite my displeasure with your recent choice of after-party locales, I still love you.   In fact, I'm grateful to you, in my own way. It's so hard to be funny and snarky when you're writing a 4-5 star review of a place. In a time where my ability to nitpick and rant, it's refreshing to finally find a place so terrible I am justified in my neurosis.   In the event that all of this is too wordy and convoluted to understand, I've made you a chart.   =Things That Are Awesome=  Yelp Martinis Zombie movies Lesbians  =Things That Are Not Awesome=  Overcrowded bars with unreasonable cover charge  See you at the next UYE, you jive motherfucker!  Hugs and kisses, Jetta  P.S. Nathan, I still have your coat. Let's make arrangements to get it back to you. The longer I have it the longer I'm going to be tempted to use it the next time Misty S and I have "roleplay night".   Which I might do anyway if I find out all this was your idea : - )

I think Margaritaville exists only to give others what a prelude of what Hell, if it indeed exists, would be like; consuming overpriced coconut shrimp and other seafood cliches while the same four or five songs are pumped through the sound system (with accompanying video, because nothing whets your appetite like seeing senile rock stars struggling through a live performance).  The food looks and tastes like a Red Lobster menu with a makeover. It's the same garbage you've eaten at every other seafood restaurant ever, except this time the dishes have clever references to Jimmy Buffet songs in their name.  What's the difference between the "Cheeseburger In Paradise" and a Whopper? Five bucks.  Every drink contains sweet and sour mix. I swear to god, even my pina colada had a greenish tint to it.   On busy nights they hire clowns and stilt walkers, who sing along to the songs and even add in their own words. Sometimes they walk to your table and shoot fake ketchup at you. At least you know why the food is overpriced, right?  As if all these crimes against decency aren't enough, if you end up having to wait for a table you're encouraged to browse the gift shop, where for the cost of your dinner you can get a shirt depicting a parrot interpreting the lyrics of the very song you've been forced to listen to all night.   Where's a White Castle when you need one?

What qualifies them to call themselves "Native New Yorker"?  What does peddling cheap batches of taste-impaired wings, crunchy pizza and nacho platters have to do with New York?  Or even "New Yorker"? Where's the man in the fancy hat that serves me my wings? What, you don't have one? Then again, I ask, what's "New York" about you?  A checkered tablecloth and some black and white photographs? Oh wow, a picture of an old automobile.   Get the fuck out of town.  .50 extra for a cup of ranch? Have you the brain worms? What, has there been a ranch dressing famine?   And not to be picky here, but usually, you're supposed to wait for the cheese to melt before you serve the smothered fries. Is that why I'm paying the .50 per ranch? Is your "shredded cheese heating machine" broken?   Does New York know you're up to this?

The continued existence of McFarlane Toys poses, to me, a trouble dilemma of reality-defying logic on par with how nobody ever seems to notice that Archie wears the same damn outfit every day.  I never see anyone actually buying anything. I mean, occasionally someone will take one of those overpriced abominations off of the shelf (much to the anxiety of the staff), check the price tag before letting out a bit of a chuckle and putting it back.   Sometimes, if you're lucky, you'll get one of those "McFarlane virgins".  "Oh my god look! They have KISS figures! And Simpsons! nd they have marines! Semper Fi! Why is this all so expensive? And whose 'Spawn'?"  But again, none of these amusing yet painfully commonplace instances actually generate any profit for the store.  I have several theories as to how they stay in business.   One of the more ludicrous ones involves someone who I will call the "McFarlane Fairy", a mysterious, eccentric recluse with lots of money who comes in the store after all the working class rabble have been shooed out and browses at his leisure. Perhaps he takes the figures out of the package and makes dioramas out of them. Perhaps not.  Maybe McFarlane Toys really aren't intended to be stores. Perhaps they're merely "toy museums" that let you look at all the wonders of Todd McFarlane's genius.   After all, Museums let you buy their work from them, don't they?  We're talking about the douchebag that blew his life savings on that ball Mark "I Can't Wipe My Own Ass" McGuire hit to dubiously break Hank Aaron's home run record.   This guy doesn't know a sound investment from his own asshole.  What I want to know is when making comic books wasn't enough for this guy.  At one point in his life did he say "Fuck comic books. What I really want to do with my life is produce a line of ultra-realstic and highly detailed action figures that will adorn the shelves of GameStops and Spencer's Gifts everywhere"?  Maybe I wouldn't be so bitter if they made action figures out of athletes when I was a kid.  Wait. They did. They were called "Starting Lineups" and the only people who bought them were parents who didn't realize they were supposed to be collectibles.  And dragons? Great. Something to match that poster of two dragons doing it while some gnome smokes a bowl of pot that I bought at Spencer's.  Oh boy. Marines. Just what I need. A miniature toy soldier that I can hang on my wall who will look down on me for not enlisting when my country needed me. Gee, it's like having a three-dimensional picture of my father.  And which Metallica box set features the "Action Whine" Lars Ulrich that cries blood every time I download a song from limewire?  McFarlane makes overhyped comic books with one hand and peddles overpriced action figures with the other.   He's a complicated man who only wants to share his love of himself with his community.  I am both proud and disgusted to welcome him to the west side.

I have this recurring dream where I'm lying in bed, and my friend Tyrone calls. And he's all "I can dig more clams than you!" And I'm like "No wai!" And then I spend the rest of the dream looking for a place to park. I don't know where that dream came from. I don't even know anyone named Tyrone.  But if I did this is where I would take him. Because Black Bear Diner is as surreal as road trip dining gets.   The ironic pictures featuring little bears trying to do what humans do ("haha! Silly bear! Manual transmissions are for humans! One day you will become somebody's rug! Ha ha!). The suspenders. Reading your menu from an old Goodyear Gazette. The faint presence of Wilford Brimley in the air. Wilford Brimley is everywhere, and can take many forms.*  But alas, Tyrone is not real, and so therefore did not make a suitable dining companion. But Misty S is very much real (and very much my squeeze), so I brought her here instead.  Our initial disappointment at the absence of African-American leather daddies aside, we quite enjoyed ourselves.  She ordered the pot roast, and me the chicken fried steak. Both came with a side of mashed potatoes (you get your choice of two from a list of six or so) that came topped with gravy that matched the entree. This was done without prompting. I was so excited to see my meat and potatoes so perfectly accessorized that I nearly shat glitter.  BBD's claim to fame is giving you a lot of food. It says so like twenty times on their menu. And in reality it is a lot. So much that you can hear the strained whines and cries of other patrons trying to finish their garlic bread. Or was it Texas Toast? I don't think it counts as Texas Toast if it's only grilled on one side.   Why do I keep capitalizing Texas Toast?   And why is everyone staring at me? Is it because I'm not dry heaving my way through my entree?  Oh shit, is there glitter on my seat?  *My review of Trader Joe's. Oh snap, self-reference!

The service at MBGFR is simply fabulous. The waitresses are always on their best behavior and aim to please.    I personally recommend the tzatziki as a starter, although I'd just as soon eat the pita by itself. I've never been given pita that wasn't fresh and scalding hot.   Most of the menu allows you to add a Greek salad for $2. Other menu items allow you to substitute it in lieu of seasoned fries for no additional charge. Whatever the cost, I recommended getting the Greek salad with your meal. It is infinitely excellent.   Personally I recommend the gyro wrap.   And the Baklava is so good you'll want to pick it apart.  It's perfect for a light, healthy brunch.

I love Lee Lee for all the wrong reasons.  Like Maury Povich and shoplifting, I know I shouldn't love Lee Lee's as much as I do, but I can't help it.   I love how it organizes it's food by country of origin. By. Fucking. Country.   I have never needed to google my grocery list before shopping, but now that I've started, I can't stop. I feel like I'm learning. A super happy tasty adventure of learning every time I need to buy some fucking noodles.  Screw wal-mart. I never learn anything at wal-mart, except that the third world's largest export is Spider-Man pajamas and that little Johnny wandered away from mommy and daddy and is waiting for them at Customer Service where he's already tore into a Hershey's Bar that they will be expected to pay for.  I love how they give me a ridiculous amount of options on a choice that I shouldn't be tasked to make. Why make ramen when I can have my pick of hundreds of different kinds of noodles, none of which have I any experience making!?   Fuck it. I'm taking the Mi Chay, the imitation shrimp noodle and the cantonese egg noodle.   And at about 99 cents (give or take) a bag of exotic carbohydrate madness, I can finally live out my forty-five-minute-old dream of eating every style of Asian noodle!  Which, once you factor in that about 80 percent of my diet is piles and piles of noodles, means I will probably get to accomplish this before the end of the month.  But that's fine.  I'll just move onto batshit insane Asian snackfoods.  Like Hello Kitty chocolate cookies and fish-flavored corn chips. And dried squid!   I love that it makes the effort to stock the very same food that I am trying to get away from.   Do you really think I drove all this way from Avondale to wander around this place in a haze for an hour and pick up a bottle of mustard?  You must be out of your fucking mind.  I'm tempted to take some of these obvious knock offs of "american food" and see if its actually better their way.  Oh.  And they have a chopsticks aisle.  Okay, not a whole aisle.  It's a spoon/fork/chopstick aisle.  But half of it is chopsticks.   It's right next to the aisle with all the plates and bowls that you see at all the other Chinese and Japanese restaurants you've ever been to.  Huh. I've slurped miso out of a bowl that looked just like this one.  I could buy this bowl. And get the stuff to make miso and then I could have my own restaurant-style miso in my RESTAURANT STYLE BOWL at home!!!!111  But I won't. Because there is no atmosphere at my house and I hate eating alone.   That's why I bento.   So at least that way I can plop next to strangers on campus and eat my  fish balls and pak choy out of my plastic box (which I bought at Lee squared, thank you) I can pretend that I have lots of friends who accept me as that "quirky lunch box girl".  Fuck. I forgot what I was talking about again.  And look at all this freshly-killed fish!   See, I would pay Ichi Ban prices for any sushi made here.   Because I can determine it's fresh. Because it's still looking at me.  Who do you think you are, challenging me to a staring contest right before they killed you and put you out on the shelf?  The only problem with Lee to the second power is that it's right across the street from Pholicious.  Which means any time I would drive over there to try their restaurant, I would get sidetracked and just drive over to Pholicious.  Goddamit. This is the problem with de facto segregation.  Oh no, time to hit wikipedia again.  Why can't she just use normal words, like a normal person?  And why does she always wait until her pills wear off before she starts writing reviews?  The world may never know.  Cuz I sure as hell don't.

People often make the mistake of assuming I know what I'm doing. That I'm a woman with a plan.   It's an easy error to make; I'm a somewhat articulate woman working towards a bachelor's degree who holds multiple state credentials. Yeah, I guess a certificate with a photocopied signature on it can count as credentials, right?   But in reality, there is no method to the madness. Like a jazz soloist or a Republican defending anti-gay marriage laws, I'm just making this shit up as I go along.   I am often overwhelmed by seemingly trivial decisions, like "what color should I paint my nails today" or "should I give this place 1 or 2 stars?"   Places like Coldstone or Baskin Robbins, therefore, frustrate me to no end.  Do I get a flavor I know I'll like? Or do I branch out? But what if that flavor's totally nasty and I can't finish it? What mix-ins should I get? Oh god there are people in line behind me, make up your mind, voice in my head!!!  When Amanda B brought me to Chill, the first thing I noticed was the wide array of gelato flavors. Immediately, I felt myself paralyzed with indecision.   Oh shit. Pineapple and Coconut? Dulce de Leche? Sweet Zombie Jesus, they have a Twix flavor! Oh Eris, goddess of cha--oh wait, you wouldn't do me any good in this situation, would you?  Off-handed, perhaps sensing my panic, Amanda's sister Allison grinningly said to me "you've got to try the chocolate pistachio. It's the best."  At first I was a little hesitant to take her suggestion. While chocolate is awesome and pistachio is awesome, 2 x awesome does not always awesome squared.   Other examples of two awesome things that suck when put together;   Babies and movie theaters. Girlfriends and strip clubs.   Roleplaying games (fuck yeah I slayed a dragon!) and the internet (sorry guys, I can't go out tonight, gotta stay home and do a raid with my guild).  But Allison assured me that this would be all the chocolatey pistachio goodness I could ever ask for. I was sold.   Legend has it that once, an Italian merchant once gave Buddha a bowl of gelato. Buddha was so delighted with the dessert that he reciprocated the gesture and gave the merchant a book of Buddhist teachings to bring back with him to Italy. Unfortunately the merchant's ship was sunk on the voyage home, and Buddhism didn't reach Italy for hundreds of years.  What does that have to do with my review? Nothing.   The chocolate pistachio really was amazing. And at 2.59 for a small it has a reasonable cost/delicious ratio (I'm assuming anyway. Allison covered me in the event I didn't like mine so she could finish it herself).   I may not be as well versed in the art and science of gelato as others, but I can tell you from my limited experience that it was creamy, chocolatey, smooth, nutty and everything I am told gelato is supposed to be.   Maybe next time I will choose a flavor by myself. But I wouldn't count on it. I was late for work today because I couldn't decide which pair of pink flip flops would better match my Sarah Jessica Parker jeans.   I am completely flabbergasted as to how I get out as much as I do.

It was a dark and gloomy Sunday night in downtown Phoenix. It was 6:30 Pm. On any other day in this city the streets would be lit up with restaurants eagerly proclaiming "we're open! we're open! come on in! give us your money!"   But not on Sundays. On Sundays everyone closes their doors and goes home. As invisible as magic, unicorns, and Mariah Carey's acting talent.   It was Nathan's birthday, and Amanda B and I took it upon ourselves to devise a place suitable for a birthday dinner. You might as well have asked us to perform brain surgery with a screwdriver and a plunger.  "Two Hippies?" "Closed." "That BBQ place you like?" "Closed." "Um...there's a Pizza Hut---" "Uh, no." "Sorry."  Yeah. Guess which one I was in that exchange.  Finally we came upon Mamma Mia's, and collectively griped at how we had forgotten our "freebie" chips from the Birthday pARTy. Thankfully, they were open, though you wouldn't have known it by the way the girl ushered us through the kitchen to the dining room.  There are two types of people who order pizza. There are those who, when asked their preference, list all the toppings they like. And there are those who respond by listing all the things they don't like on pizza. With the latter option, everyone gathers around the menu and lists off what available toppings they wouldn't eat. Through the process of elimination, you pick from the available toppings and come with a democratically agreed upon pie.  And that's how we decided on basil and fresh tomato slices. With a side order of meatballs.  "How many meatballs come in a side?" asked Nathan. "Five." "That's perfect."  At first I was skeptical. How is five perfect for a party of three people? Who taught you to do math, birthday boy? Big Brother?  Thankfully I kept those thoughts to myself...I know, even I was impressed with myself.  And I'm glad I did, because the meatballs were big, saucy and  spoonable, since our party of three only managed to get two sets of plastic silverware. I guess it's not just Nathan who's math is a little fubar'd.  The pizza was rather superb. So superb that, even armed with only basil and tomatoes, it was enough to satiate a palette accustomed to deep dish pepperoni sausage with buffalo sauce and buffet breadsticks.  This was like re-education for my taste buds, but without the hard labor and Chinese man screaming in my face about how awesome communism is.  The question about whether my hair was real or not aside, the staff were  accommodating and friendly.   If I ever find myself lost in the dark and lonely place that is downtown Phoenix on a Sunday after 6pm, I will definitely keep Mamma Mia's in mind. And I will remember my "freebie" chips.   Dear Phoenix,  This isn't Salt Lake City. Cut this Sunday nonsense out.  Love, Me

Things I Like That I Know I Shouldn't:  Pickle juice straight from the jar. "Rock Star" by Nickelback. A 4x4 with animal style fries from In-N-Out.  The "secret menu" is the best practical joke since Mariah Carey's movie career. It's not secret (In-N-Out has the damn thing posted on its website) and it's not much of a menu as it is just more combinations of food and condiments (except maybe the Grilled Cheese).   Yet for all my mockery, I myself am obsessed with this fast food phenomenon. Out of going to In-N-Out for two years, I haven't ordered anything off the "regular menu" in 23 months. And even then, I make one of my awestruck lackeys do it for me. It's become campus lore that if you owe Jetta a favor, expect visit In-N-Out holding a sheet of pink paper with the most nonsensical order in the history of lunch runs written on it in pink lettering.  Jetta helped you get a 90 on that test? Flying Dutchman with well done fries. Jetta came in on her day off to cover your shift in the computer lab? Grilled Cheese, light fries, and a neopolitan shake. Jetta talked your boyfriend into agreeing to a threesome with your and your best friend? You better keep it coming, because all 3x3s and animal style fries in the world will not get that harrowing, harrowing memory out of my fucking head.  While the life of a secret menu-aire may seem glamorous, it does have it pitfalls. Occasionally I send out for a protein burger (comes wrapped in a lettuce bun) and instead get a 2x2 with no condiments. Or I asked for "extra toast" and got a little baggie of slightly burnt buns. Oh, and who can forget the time I sent out for In N Out and got back a bag of McDonald's and a scolding on how it is very mean to write down an order with items that aren't on the menu. That's how I discovered McDonald's southwest chicken sandwich.   Following the secret menu is like following UFOs or cryptozoology. It's rewarding when you find a location that provides your mysterious heart attack sandwich, but other times you (or the person you sent to get your lunch) end up looking like an idiot in front of the cashier.   Still, the thrill of the plunder is worth the hassle and risk of embarrassment. Sure, that calorie bomb was never meant for human consumption, but fuck it, it was on the secret menu. It's practically a treasure.   I guess that's the ultimate joy of the In N Out experience. Getting something that (at least we are lead to believe) the average casual fast foodie does not get to experience. Fuck the casual eaters. Only real drive-thru pirates deserve the good shit.

The highlight of my Day 1 of Comic Con was running into Gary and Sheila at the J-Fashion Show and being a part of their photo shoot. Seriously, two of the most amazing photographers, and not just in the valley, but like, everywhere.   I bet even the Bizzaro versions of these two are warm, friendly, and just teeming with geekery.  If/when I become a tranny rock star b movie superstar I will probably pay these two to follow me around and take artistic "concept shots" of me doing everyday things. Just for the hell of it.   Let's hope we all don't become arch-nemeses in the meantime.  Though if I had to pick two people to be my nemeses, I'd probably pick these two anyway.   We'd be that special kind of arch nemeses that shoot lasers at each other all day and then bake brownies and drink sangria at night.  "DIE YOU WRETCHED--oh, it's five already? Cool. Let's get some jalapeno poppers."  Okay. Fantasy time is over. Back to homework and other "responsible adult" shit.

When your partner's least favorite kind of food is your most favorite kind of food, you have to pick and choose your battles.  For me, this means only suggesting Asian cuisine when Misty S is a) not feeling good, b) not feeling Yardhouse, or c) not paying.   All of these scenarios have one thing in common; they rarely ever happen.  But alas, as chance would have it, Misty S and I both came down with something over the holidays.  Thus, I began my attack.  "Let's get some pho."  "I hate pho."  "It'll make you feel better."  "No thanks. I don't like pho."  "Oh wow, you know what sounds really good right now? A big bowl of soup. Hot, steaming soup. Oh man, Ci Ci's has soup! All the chicken soup you can eat, and pizza too! Snap, chicken soup and jalapeno pizza! We'll be good in no time!"  "Fine, we'll do Pho."  Ironically, when we pulled into Pholicious we saw what may have at one point been a greasy child-infested Ci Ci's, now closed to the world like a tomb. A graveyard of all-you-can-eat-awfulness.  Walking inside, I could literally feel the steam off of other people's bowls. It was like a sriracha flavored sauna. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a gentleman drinking coconut juice right out of the fruit itself. And waiters carried around massive bowls of noodles and stuff and other stuff.   For a moment I felt that I had found my perfect restaurant.  And that's when I panicked.  For it is practically written in the cosmos that the more I love an Asian restaurant, the more likely Misty S will find it lacking.   See Also: Wong's See Also: Dragon Garden Express See Also: Any Chinese Buffet....ever.  One of the many joys in dining-in at any Asian restaurant (sushi included) is that I'm not expected to actually pronounce any of the items from the menu. That's why there's all the numbers.  Whenever I go for Mexican or Italian the waiter looks at me like I'm a tool if my pronunciation's off and corrects me before having a good laugh at it.  Oh, thank you, JEFF, for imparting your SUPERIOR knowledge of the Italian language onto me. Here, before you leave, can you make sure I'm pronouncing this correctly...  Vaffunculo e muoia! Now bring the check, I'm going to the Olive Garden.  I ordered the #2 (spring roll), and the #40 (egg noodle soup with barbeque pork, prawns, quail egg, and something something).  The spring roll was deceptively delicious for a bunch of shrimp, rice, and veggies rolled up in cold rice paper. It came with a nice thick peanut sauce that was topped with peanuts. I love it when there are multiple forms of the same ingredient in a dish. It's so aesthetically pleasing from a deconstructivist standpoint. Blah blah blah, pretentious bullshit, blah blah blah.  Before my number 40 came out, Misty's #10 (crab and asparagus soup) was served, and Misty invited me to take part of her soup. It was warm, eggy and soft. Almost with a hint of sweetness, I thought. Light, subtle, and very white.   Satie, one of my favorite composers, used to eat "white food" so that he could get into the mood to compose "white music".  This is what you learn at art school.  My number 40 was awesome. Simply awesome. Spicy, sweet, sour, noodly and meaty. It even came with a side of bean sprouts and chili peppers that I could throw into the soup myself. It was like hot pot but much cheaper and without me screaming at the top of my lungs if someone could please pass me the fucking fish balls.   The soup was so good that even after all the noodles and meat were gone I still sat there, sucking down broth by the spoonful. Misty tried several times to coach me on the proper way to hold the porcelain spoon, but alas, I make as proper a lady as I did a boy back in the day. C'est la vie, I guess.  After all the sriracha and peppers I had added, the broth was so spicy that my nose was running and my eyes were watering. I looked like I had just been cut from the Rocky Horror cast and yet I still sucked that soup like I've never had it so good.   The waiter came by and took away the broth while I was trying to cool off with some ice. I remember thinking "awww man, I wasn't done with that" but aftewards feeling grateful that I was being inadvertantly saved from myself.  I feel like I've got a sniffle coming on. Maybe if I wait it out a bit I can do my sad puppy face routine long enough that Misty gives in and takes me back to Pholicious again soon.  (After learning I was writing this review, Misty would like to remind me and inform all of you that she doesn't hate ALL Asian food. She's particular to Malay and Indian food, but can't stand all that "panda express" nonsense I gorge myself on. Surprisingly, I don't mind being the tacky and tasteless one in the relationship.)

Although I have eaten here twice and absolutely loved it, I have been afraid to write a review of it because I'm afraid people won't take it seriously.   Because they shouldn't. I gave a four-star review to Pizza Patron. Because I for one love traditionally awful pizza. The sketchier the better. I like it greasy (like my hair) and cheap (like my thrills). I love it when the pepperoni gets those little pools of oil in them and when there's so much topping that it falls off the pie while you're cutting it and you have to pick it out of the box...you know, I think I'm going to stop here before I lose my Elite Status on principle.  There's a reason you don't see me waiting in line for Pizzeria Bianco. Because I would just embarrass myself by asking the waitier if my Wise Guy could come with a side of ranch or brown sauce (you call it A-1, like that makes it classier...stfu).  The first time Misty and I went to Pizza A Metro, we took my mother. After having just learned that all that underwear in the laundry was actually mine and not my girlfriends, she really needed the cheering up. So we decided to bring her into a sweaty pizzeria and tell her we were engaged.  I say sweaty because at the time the air conditioner was broken. They did have some fans up. A whole lot of good a couple of fans did when we were sitting like five paces away from the fucking oven.  We ordered a metro-size margherita pizza, which really hampered our yelping because we spent THREE DAYS eating the damn thing. But fuck was it delicious. Here I was trying to find the craziest, fattiest meats to stack onto my pizza and all it takes is some basil and tomatoes to sate my taste buds.   The manager was really nice with a dash of eccentric charm. Which is good, because he spent our WHOLE meal standing over us, striking up small talk and asking us our opinions of the food.   Yeah man, the food's great. Now if you'll excuse us, I need to call work and tell them I need to take the week off so I can digest your fucking franken-monstrosity of a pizza.  Mom enjoyed it too, I think. With all this life-changing news happening around her, I think I could've said to her "I just saved money on my car insurance by switching to Geico" and her eyes would have filled with tears of relief and joy.  The second time we went, we brought my brother, the pickiest, most pretentious eater I have ever known.  This is a guy who defends his refusal to try sushi by saying "there are some things I just know I won't like. Like [insert homoerotic sex maneuver]." Yes, I said maneuvers. No go [synonym for "copulate"] yourself.  He actually lives down the street from a Pizza Patron and eats it 2x a week. And even HE admitted the pizza was amazing. He didn't care much for the carpaccio, but I did. And this is my review. So whatever.  I personally like the intimate space, claustrophobia aside. I'm tired of these reasonably sized restaurants that cater to normal crowds of people. I want massive kitchens that leave little to no room for diners. The smaller the dining area, the higher the likelihood you get to sit by the window. Sit by the window and watch all those other fools, I dunno, do what fools do, like watch MTV and vote against gay rights, I guess. Yeah, phobe, I can see you trampling my rights. You have just been taken off the list for my next party, jerkface.  I'm so confident in Pizza A Metro's potential for awesomeness that I'm even going to try something not pizza next time. Gasp. Am I going to violate my "no eating anything not stated in the sign" policy? Yes. This weekend (or January 18, if this ever gets to be ROTD), when I meet with some other yelper(s) for lunch, I will probably order a pasta dish. And maybe a salad.   Oh god am I about go through my  "salads only" phase? I am NOT looking forward to this.

While I was hesitant to try what was described to me as having my hair ripped out of my face by thin threads of cotton, shaving every day simply wasn't giving me the smoothness I so desperately needed. And passing for a woman is a real pain in the ass when you have to grow the 1/4 inch of facial hair needed to wax it.  The staff is really friendly and personable. Well, as friendly as they can be when ripping out facial hair. I have a limited amount of experience, but I found the threadist to be quick, professional, and relatively patient. There were a couple of times when I had to lift my head out of the chair to get my cry on, and although I could see her laughing to herself, she was patient and understanding.   The process took about 45 minutes. A few strays hair and a lack of soothing balm aside, it was the most positive "beauty" experience I've had yet. And for 35 bucks, I don't mind having to go home and pluck a few missed hairs.  I definitely recommend it for anyone interested in getting threaded. I will definitely be returning when my stubble returns.  Next time I'll pitch in for my partner to get a henna tattoo while she waits.

==The Last Time I Visit This Fucking Guitar Center==  --A tragicomedy in one act by Jetta.--  (The Bass Room of a Guitar Center. Jetta, an odd yet striking woman in her early twenties, peruses the assorted overpriced bass guitars and bass amplifiers. Underneath a veneer of exquisite beauty lies a hidden feeling of sadness and disappointed. Perhaps distressed, she flags down a GUITAR CENTER EMPLOYEE sporting a ponytail.)  GUITAR CENTER EMPLOYEE  Is there something I can help you with?  JETTA Yes, I'm looking for an upright bass.  GUITAR CENTER EMPLOYEE  An upright bass? What do you mean?  JETTA You know, a double bass. A classical one. Like in the picture over there.  (JETTA motions to a promotional still of Jimbo Wallace, bass player of Rev. Horton Heat, holding an upright bass. It is prominently displayed on the wall.)  JETTA Like the kind they use in rockabilly.  GUITAR CENTER EMPLOYEE Oh, you mean a fretless bass. We have one right over here.  JETTA No, that's a fretless bass guitar. I want an upright bass. You know, they're kind've shaped like cellos. I know there isn't one in the room, I was wondering if I could special order one through you. Or just go through the website.  GUITAR CENTER EMPLOYEE  Um, er, I don't know. Let me check.  (GUITAR CENTER EMPLOYEE exits. JETTA sends a few text messages. He returns.)  GUITAR CENTER EMPLOYEE We don't have any of those in the back.   JETTA Can I order one through your website? Or should I go through Musician's Friend?  GUITAR CENTER EMPLOYEE  Um, I'm not sure. You could try both I guess.   JETTA I think I'll just go to Sam Ash and see if they have one. Thanks though.  (JETTA breaks eye contact, effectively ending the conversation. GUITAR CENTER EMPLOYEE does not get the hint.)  GUITAR CENTER EMPLOYEE  Can I help you with anything else? Maybe a new bass amp. We do have some acoustic bass guitars in the acoustic room. Would you like to look at one of those?  JETTA No thanks. It's not really the same, you know.  GUITAR CENTER EMPLOYEE So what kind of music do you play?  JETTA The kind that you need an upright bass for.  GUITAR CENTER EMPLOYEE  Oh.  JETTA Excuse me, I need to walk past you.  GUITAR CENTER EMPLOYEE  Well if you need anything, my name is--  JETTA I need you to get out of my way.  (JETTA, enraged, storms off, the clicking of her heels echoing throughout the whole store. GUITAR CENTER EMPLOYEE looks around and sees a teenager playing with a brand new B.C. Rich while their parent looks on. He walks over to them as the curtain goes down.)

Chinese restaurants are to Avondale what pizza joints are to Peoria; they come included with every strip mall, equipped with generic menus, Pepsi fountains and a seemingly randomly assigned embarrassingly stereotypical name.   Golden China is on the opposite corner of 107th & Indian School as Dragon Garden Express and a block west of Wong's. This explains why I never tried it all these years. I just saw it at superfluous.  It's like putting Ballpark pizza right by Pullano--oh wait.  I usually don't get takeout at night because at Wong's and DGE their dinner entrees come with steamed rice and I can't hang with steamed rice. It's like fried rice without the personality, or Ann Coulter without her Adam's apple.  But dammit I needed some sweet and sour pork or kung pao two. There was no negotiating with my appetite. It was Chinese or the other thing I'm always in the mood for: ramen. And I've been trying to cut down on that. At the rate I'm putting all these preservatives in my body, I will live to be 200. And Law and Order will still be on television.  So I decided to take a chance on Golden China in hopes they could spare me from the wrath of the steamed rice god.  Being too distracted by the superbly cliche interior decorating, I failed to notice the menu posted on the window. So once I got to the counter, I was only able to browse for a few seconds before just randomly selecting whatever sounded good.  I ordered the twice cooked pork. While I sat in one of their two-small-for-me-but-what isn't? chairs, one of their staff brought it out to me and handed me a plastic bag that felt a little heavier than normal.   When I got home, I found that my standard styrofoam tv takeout tray had come with two small paper bags.   One contained the fortune cookies and some hot oil.  The other came with a cheese wonton, an eggroll, and a crab puff.  While I was delighted to see all the treats my dinner came with, it left me perplexed.  If the eggroll is right here, then what's in the third compartment of the takeout tray? Oh please don't be two compartments of fried rice.  Be still my beating heart.  My dinner came with fried rice AND NOODLES.  An entree with noodles? Are you sure you aren't Panda Express?  As expected, the pork was amazing. And spicy. Glass of milk spicy. The noodles were soft and slimy, the crab puff was crabtastic, the eggroll was savory and crunchy, not even the bland and unimaginative fried rice could ruin this meal.   Looking back, I realize that I am really bad at describing flavors. How did I get to be Elite again?  I was so full I thought I would rupture my stomach but I still wanted more.  So I went again for lunch the next day.  I got the sweet and sour pork. It was hot and juicy, with chunks of pineapple mixed in with the vegetables and tender meat. While not nearly as filling as the dinner experience, it served to stave off my endless hunger for cheap Chinese for a few hours.  The takeout is just as good and filling as Wong's dine-in. I can't attest to GC's dining-in experience yet, because every time I've gone there I was the only one in the restaurant, and I have a rule about being at the only occupied table in a restaurant. That happened to me on a date once. It's hard to maintain interesting "getting to know you" conversation while some waiter lurks over you practically begging you with their eyes to give them something to do.   Moral of the story: If the zombie apocalypse occurs and it turns out that brains taste like orange chicken, just leave me behind.
