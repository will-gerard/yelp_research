Alex is the real deal. I'm particularly neurotic about cutting my hair but she always does such an amazing job, I never leave feeling anything but amazing. She's showed me so many things I can take home to help achieve different looks and better ways to naturally take care of my hair. I'm in LOVE with my hair and I attribute much of that to Alex and her true talent. I have to just add, she's an amazing person to get to sit and have a conversation too. I am so glad to have been referred to her!

Very good food, completely amazing to be more correct. It was pricey and I didn't dig that everything is al a carte but the food made up for any grievance. The service wasn't exactly fast but I was catching up with a friend so enjoyed not feeling pressured out. It's a great place for a special night out.

Hands down my favorite sushi bar in Phoenix.Their food and drinks are not only really beautiful and unusual, they are so amazingly delicious. The staff are amazing, they have always made the experience fabulous and are a huge contributor on why I recommend them and go back so often... can be slightly spendy if your on a budget and plan to drink but I always find it to be worth the money...plus they have an awesome reverse happy hour that can really cut cost.   Only teeny tiny grip is what others have mentioned, uncomfortable chairs...boo hoo, I know...all else trumps chair discomfort.

best chicken gyro of my life. Also, fast and friendly service. I will be drooling over this for a while.

I recently saw Whitney Cummings perform with some friends. It was a very entertaining show and I thought she was hilarious which is why this rating even got 2 stars. I was overall disappointed with the experience with Stand up Live. It was awkward that they sat 3 people directly in front of us, literally right at our table, so it left no room at all on the table for drinks and food. The food was mediocre at best and the drinks were all very weak and overpriced. The service took a really long time but was personable and pleasant. The moral of my story is I have learned that if I return, I would be sure to reserve a table, eat dinner elsewhere before or after the show.

Amazing! very serene surrounds and an incredible massage, possibly best I've ever had. I'd recommend them to anyone and everyone, I also plan to go back for certain.

I loved Taco Guild! I had not heard of it and some friends wanted to go. My first reaction, honestly, was "how great can ANOTHER taco place be in PHX?!". I was very pleasantly surprised! From the get go, super yummy chips and salsa and margaritas. The taco selections are range from unique to the expected. Their beef tacos were amazing and a definite recommendation. I also totally recommend their side rice. I will definitely be going back and not hesitating to tell others to check it out. :)

Amazing food, I love the sauce they use on their pizza. The atmosphere was really comfortable and they have a great cocktail menu. I shared the Pomo pizza and mista salad and it was perfect and just what I wanted. The waiter was friendly and charming and the limocello shots at the end was the way perfect to finish off a great meal. I'll definitely recommend and return. :)
