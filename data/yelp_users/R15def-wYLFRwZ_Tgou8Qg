Reasonably priced burrito compared to Filibertos.   Get the California burrito. Super tasty. Open all day.  The Cali Bureet is a carne asada based burrito with french fries in it. Super tasty and an excellent value.

Del Taco? Get the fuck outta here. Taco Bell? No way in hell.  Hands down the best fast food Mexican restaurant on the face of the planet.  The stuffed quesadillas are out of this world delicious.  The Chicken Tacos al Carbon: quite the tasty street taco.  I can only assume the other stuff they sell is excellent too. Red salsa is ok, but the green salsa is where its at.  Happy feasting.

Don't get me started on how much I love this place and its owner, Gary. Best Chinese in Scottsdale (Hsubaloo and Segrio can corroborate these claims).  I order 1 thing, and one thing only: General Tao's Chicken. Extra extra extra extra spicy, extra chicken (only $1 more). It is to die for. Great big chunks of chicken, tossed in a deliciously sweet sauce that is littered with chili peppers. Top notch quality. (under $10 and change with tax)  I have also had the pot stickers here. Apparently steamed and then grilled to put some heavenly char-flavoring on them.  (a little expensive at $7.95 plus tax, but oh so good.)  Gary, the owner, is the best.. always friendly.

Treatments I received were met with marginal benefit.  ...And that's fine...  What is unacceptable is that after my visit, they didn't file for my insurances correctly, and have been hounding me for $200. On my most recent phone call, they threatened to turn this debt over to collections.   This is an office mistake, and it should be met with customer service, rather than threatening my credit score.

This store is filled with book nerds.   I say this with all the love in my heart, and here's why:  After spending some time at the pool, Rabbi Andrew Michael Doohan III and I walked into this fine establishment on a brutal summer day. We had collectively decided that "we needed to read more" to "do gooder english" and "make more cents" when speaking.  I told the Rabbi that I was going to buy him one of my favorite books(S.O.G... Vietnam non-fiction... he never read it), and in return he was going to buy whatever book I decided that I wanted to read.   Two kind gentlemen were seated behind the counter, and they possessed the appearance of being knowledgeable so I decided to give them a test. I told them what books I enjoyed reading(thrillers and an assortment of easily digested quicker reads).   They knew exactly what to recommend(Lee Child, Killing Floor), and I have never been more satisfied with a bookstore experience. Although a big draw for this place is the book signings, I have never been to one. I have, however returned several times for various book needs..... 5-stars Poisoned Pen. I love you with all my heart, but I think we should just be friends on facebook.

What is a winesky?   I'm so very glad that you asked. A winesky is a cocktail containing the happy marriage between Coach House's finest cabernet and whisky from the deepest well in all of  Scottsdale. Conceived from the mind of my favorite genius bartender, Drew, a winesky is an all out assault on your senses, and if you have one too many of them, you will surely be ass-over-tea-kettle in no time flat.  Coach house is the best bar in Scottsdale. Hands down. (DJs was a close second) I generally come here with Rabbi Andrew Michael Doohan III. If it is a proper night, we will stroll in sideways at 12:00 am on the dot, and our standard order is two shots of whisky and a pitcher of Bud Light. Often, if Drew is working, he will line our order up as soon as the Rabbi and I walk in the door. He knows us a little too well, perhaps.   $13 for the first round. Well shots(including wineskys) are generally $3.50. Full pitchers are $6 or $6.50(domestic, of course).  I love the other bartenders too, although some of them overcharge on occasion, and they don't necessarily get my jokes.....  Christmas lights from November-February. Free Barbecue every Giants home game during Spring Training, and almost every Sunday for the rest of the year.

Best cheese steaks I've ever had.   The Spaghetti and meatballs are an amazing duo as well.  Try the Pizza. Its Fantastic.  "But what about Philadelphia and New York?!?!"  Shut up, homers. Go back and sniff your own pretentious farts.  Finally, the chicken parm sandwich is out of this world. An ideal situation is to bring a friend and get one whole chicken parm and one cheese steak with everything, so you can get the best of both worlds. Every time I have someone in town, I force them to go to Defalco's, and I have never seen a disappointed face.

People love to hate this venue.   I love to love it. No, its not cool like some of the establishments in the Valley (the CB), but it consistently has great acts, it bears no pretension, and I've never had a bad time.   I like that the floor is sticky, they attract seedy individuals, and brutal metal bands will play here.  5 Stars.

An excellent library with free computer access, clean facilites, and an extremely friendly staff.   Copies or printouts at this library are $.25 for one page black and white, and they have a free fax machine for local numbers.  Honestly, this is one of the nicest modern libraries I have ever been in. They have a vast collection of all types of media, and it is very easy to navigate.

I have a hard time finding anything wrong with this place.   Dog Friendly? Yes.  Customer Friendly? Absolutely.  Delicious food? You bet your ass.   A little on the pricey side for a drive through(nothing too terrible, but probably around $8 without a drink is a good marker), and the hours could be better.  Chicken Pesto Panini is delicious. Comes on white( or wheat if you ask) with mushrooms and tomatoes. This is my go to dish at d'lish. It's like sex. Sometimes they screw something up, but no worries, it's all good. You are still eating a delicious sandwich.(having sex.)  Also try the humanitarian wrap. Its good. Not a fan of the "burgers", but the cali club is a delicious breakfast treat, and so is the recently stumbled upon frittata( chicken sausage n stuff frittata on a hashbrown, on  a piece of wheat toast with chipotle sauce drizzled on top.)

This place is easily the best Italian restaurant in the valley.   The atmosphere is cozy. And yes, you will be seated near other parties, so if you are planning on having a lurid conversation you might want to choose another restaurant. Don't make any loud inappropriate jokes.  I know Rabi Doohan III has been here on more than one occasion, and I'm wondering how he coped having to spend a whole dinner session without making a loud inappropriate joke. I know for a certainty that if the two of us went and had dinner there, that we might rack up a complaint or two. Anyway...  The food is top notch. I had the veal saltimbocca, which is hard to find in the valley. I highly approve.  The service was top notch. I felt right at home. The owner made me feel like I was apart of the family.  If you go here on a date(app, entree, bottle of wine) expect to spend anywhere in the range of $75-$90. If you want to pop in for an entree you can get out of there in the 15-25 range. Well worth it in my opinion.

Patties is a decent dive bar.   It gets a little crowded for my taste at times, but their cheap beer (pbr) is a good draw.  Ping pong? Check...but only during the day.  Pool tables? Check. Punching bag(speed bag) game? Check. A filthy dance floor to shake your groove thing on, manned by a dinosaur DJ hidden in his cage, looking strangely down on his minions? Check.  Expect your time here to be rowdy.

There are a million of these stupid burrito places, and they all taste the same. Unfortunately for this place, they always screw up my order, and don't really seem to give a shit.  I always order the cali burrito, which is a carne asada burrito with french fries in it(use sparingly, kids). Its always wrong... still tastes good, but something is always missing.  anyway. 2 stars

The Chicken green chile tamale is lights out. I've had some of the others but that one is by far the best.   The owner's daughter is also lights out. Super cute. Call me maybe?

What did you say?! I CAN'T HEAR YOU!  "I SAID RABBITS EAT LETTUCE!" (South Park, Season 1)  This is the loudest goddamn bar on earth. I know some dance clubs that aren't this loud. Everything about this place is obnoxious. Douche-faced bartenders pour weak drinks at outrageous prices... and like I said, most of the time the music is so loud that you can't hear the person next to you.  Saving graces: Bottomless Mimosas, Saturday and Sunday. Although the food is outrageously expensive, it is good.  Loud.

This is by far my favorite coffee shop in the Phoenix Metroplex.   It's a house.  They serve food. It's delicious.  Get the Toddy(Cold-brewed coffee). It's my fave.

This is my first review. Omakase (i.e. "chef's choice") is not recommended for everyone, but if you are in the mood for the best meal you will ever eat in your life, this place is for you.   Went with a date, and had the 5 course tasting menu, with a couple of bottles of sake. Every bite of food was better than the last. I won't go into detail about our entire meal, but standouts included the steamed clam soup, with 5 different types of mushrooms, and the whole fried shrimp appetizer. (Don't be afraid, eat the head)  Itamae, Kurita-san, is a master of flavor and composition. 5-stars. I will be back... as often as my pocketbook allows.

Where to start. I was feeling hungry at 8:45 pm. I remember that Zawack-attack mentioned that she loved this place, so I thought, "What the hell? Lets try 'em out."  First of all, they have a check in offer for $5 off any pizza... Don't threaten me with a good deal. I'm a man who likes my value.   I got a 4 topping 12 inch. Mushrooms and peppers on the whole thing. Chicken and meatball on the left side. Pepperoni and Sausage on the right side. I was blown away be the flavor.  The only way I can think to describe the mushrooms is, "Zesty," and they definitely get bonus points for using two types of bell peppers on the pizza (green and orange). The meatball topping was flavorful, and its hard to go wrong with sausage. The pepperonis were enormous, and I guess that's a good thing I guess?? I don't know. The chicken comes in cubed form, which looks weird, but was pretty good nonetheless.   All I know is that when I was shoveling this delicious pizza into my mouth, and it traveled across my Cretan palate, I had a big smile on my face. Definitely worth a visit. With the $5 off check-in offer my pizza was a shave under $7, and it lasted me two meals.

This is my favorite park in Scottsdale. It is located directly on the green belt and has plenty of room for activities. A great place to play a game of pickup anything.   I like to throw the ball for Oena/oenster/Bonester/Oenabologna at the baseball fields. Gotta make sure the coppers aren't hanging around the parking lot, but a great place to throw the ball otherwise.

This is a great shop.  I really like the guys who work here. Rabbi Andrew Michael Doohan and I went here to buy him a hybrid. More than accommodating, they helped us out with anything we needed. The rabbi bought a bike at a very decent price. We walked out of the store and notice that the front tire was having a significant issues. When I look at it again there was some significant dry rot and I started to get a little bit angry.  We brought the bike back to the shop not 30 seconds after buying it, and we showed them the issue... The guys were more than helpful. They put brand new tires on both the front and the back wheel , and sent us on our way. (After a heavy discussion of used and vintage video games).   After a good ride at home we might have noticed a couple more issues, but I'll explore them a little more during their generous 30 day warranty and exchange policy... If I don't end up revising this review, everything turned out perfectly.   TLDR: Great selection of used bikes. Friendly flexible staff. Great policy when it comes to used bikes. I'll recommend all my friends to get their bike work done here as long as they continue to impress.

Nope.   Nope. Nope. Nope.  It was Rabbi Andrew Michael Doohan III's birthday celebration, and I was unable to get in the front door.  Working at the loudest and the newest bar in Scottsdale does not make you a GOD, Gorilla Juice-head Bouncer. I stood in line for 15 minutes at the front of the line, while I watched 30 people grease the bouncer and walk right in. Not having any cash in my pocket meant that I was shit out of luck.  So I walked away. The decor of the place seems awesome, but I'm not going to put up with that pretentious bullshit.

Getting hassled about whether or not you work "in the industry" puts customers off and completely awkward. "Where do you work?" "In what city?" "What did you do?"  The answer is, "none of your fucking business." Don't have "industry night" if you aren't going to extend deals to everyone... or at least be consistent about it. Quality and consistency are the only things I ask.  The "Acoustic Blues" starts at 8. It's really more of the acoustic rather than the blues portion of that phrase, and is also played on an electric guitar....and if that doesn't make any sense at all, then you just need to go visit The Western on a Sunday, because by god can Sarah Robinson sing. Quite the set of pipes. Her other counterparts were impressive too.

This place is cool. Way too cool for me. The owner of the business is super friendly and very knowledgeable.   The selection of vintage clothing and vintage accessories is pretty good. They have a great selection of vintage and rare band Ts.   I didn't have enough time to check everything out, but I will be back.
