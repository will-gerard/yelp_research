This is our kind... a real winner-the most godly breakfast burrito I've ever had!! and FRESSSSSHHHHH made with their own special salsa. Love the urban decor indoor, and you see a mexican grandma cookin' it up in the kitchen-you know you're in good hands. We had to wait for a while for our food, but that was good news to us=ignore the whiners who demand the food fast. It meant that they were cooking everything from scratch. It's important that chefs invest their time and love in their food, and it reflected through my first "ahh, this is heavenly" bite of the burrito. I'm so happy I found this place!! I plan on buying their El Sol salsa. Always follow the traditional mexican bakery-guaranteed you will get authentic mexican dish. Not only El Sol was an exciting discovery, but downtown Chandler is a very cute n historic area to scope out! It's filled with many other mexican joints, which I'm sure are delicious. I look forward to going back to that area!  This beats Los Favoritos. Period.

A hidden gem! Tried this place for the first time and ate their vegan cupcake (I'm a vegan)-was so impressed! I'm definitely coming back to try their chai latte.. and hopefully in the near future, they will have a vegan option on their breakfast and lunch menu because it is so close to where I live!

My boyfriend and I came to CenPho for his tattoo appointment, and I've seen raves about vegan doughnuts (Chris and I are vegans) so we had to grab the chance. Pulling up this place, I was immediately excited-I LOVE small and local business situated in an old house. We got in and immediately fell in love with it. The doughnuts were OUT, but we ended up having a delicious vegan burrito! I would definitely go back when I'm in the area again-only if you would open another location in Chandler! :D

I've been getting manicure/pedicure all my life (I've been spoiled plenty..), and this one stuck-it is the most modern and nicely-n-girly decorated nail salons that I've been to. It's the kind of salon that makes you feel like you're in a high-end salon yet you walk away with the same price as you would get at a regular vietnamese owned nail salon. The design of the salon is so cute and unique-I like the idea of circular bar with granite top-a setting for manicures and glass waterfall that adds the zen-quality to the girly ambience. The recliner massage chairs were so nice, and there's enough room to push the chair all the way back. My manicurist was a doll, and every worker there is dressed out of Urban Outfitters. This is the kind of salon that appeals to young women. I liked that there are several options for manicure and pedicure-ranging from standard to deluxe. I always aim for the cheapest package and was disappointed that the leg massage wasn't included, but everything else is a plus. I hope the reviewers are right in that the color will stay on!  I would recommend this place for a girl get-togethers. Best to make an appointment because I showed up as a walk-in one Wednesday afternoon, and it was still busy-I had to wait for a while.

This is my second review of this restaurant. The first time I went when they opened, I wasn't impressed with the food selections and slow service thus my first bad review. But overtime, they really have IMPROVED-they vamped up the menu and the service is MUCH better. So kudos to them! My favorites are Arizona Rolls and Living Caesar Salad as well as their smoothies and coffee! I am happy to say I go there once or twice/week-their vegan selections are delicious! I'm also glad that it is conveniently located in my area.

Nami-you had me at hello!  My sweet tooth is SO thankful this exists and that it is close to my work site (though I'd prefer it was closer to my home-pretty please consider setting up another one in Chandler/Gilbert??? :). I'm a loyal Green customer (no restaurant has topped this restaurant as far as I know, NATIONALLY!!), and Nami is an exciting addition. I haven't gone there for Brunch, but I do plan on very very soon!   I can't pick a favorite because everything is good there. I like to try a new Tsoynami flavor each time I go there. I love their play on their toppings such as Captain Crunch and how it brings back childhood memories.   This is a place I would bring my non-vegans to-not one of them has walked away disappointingly.

I'm a GF vegan and a big supporter of local/sustainable food, so first, I applaud this restaurant for serving local and organic food. When I heard about this restaurant, I was excited-another restaurant to add to the list of restaurants that I can eat at. While I support this restaurant and their philosophy, I believe there needs to be work on vegan dishes. I ordered Tofu Kebab, priced at $15, and it only consisted of smoked tofu and green and red pepper. I was really disappointed because I looked forward to it and was expecting a variety of veggies with more flavor added to the tofu. My husband and I also ordered Spinach and Artichoke dip. We envisioned the warm, cheesy kind, but instead, it was a cold dip laden with a pool of oil. We got sick to our stomachs and we ended up having an upset stomach afterwards. Overall, it was very pricey for such flat dishes (My husband also ordered a GF, vegan pizza, and if it was not for that, I would give this a 1-star rating). I hate to criticize a restaurant that supports veganism, but if you want to keep people like us coming, I hope that the chefs will consider this criticism and find a way to improve the vegan dishes. We cook alot at home and have a very cultivated taste, and we appreciate restaurants that deliver exciting dishes that we would not cook at home.
