I came here to get take-out. It was broad daylight, so I wasn't too bothered by the sketch neighborhood. And I parked next to a Lexus in the hopes that my car would look so crappy in comparison no one would want to take it. I ordered the machaca plate with rice, beans, and a flour tortilla. After wrapping up only about a quarter of the machaca into my tortilla, I instantly regretted not getting another tortilla. I was in tortilla heaven. Soooo tasty! The machaca was awesome as well and I ate the entire meal without hesitation.

As others have pointed out, the menu has changed drastically, but I didn't actually have a problem with the change. The food we ordered came out fine. Not anything to write home about, but certainly a touch above mediocre.   The problem was the waitress. We were sitting outside and it was quite chilly. She convinced us to order some spiced tea to warm ourselves up and did a good job selling the idea. But the tea never came and the waitress never checked in on us. We didn't even get any waters or the chance to flag her down. Another server dropped off our food in about twenty minutes and we had to ask him to get us some water. How is this acceptable at all? The waitress stopped by and said the bar didn't get the tea together and apologized, promising that she'd send the manager over. The manager never came over and it took another fifteen minutes after we finished eating to get the check and to pay.   This place isn't cheap, but even if it was, I would expect better service than what my friend and I received.

Thanks to Mike for taking care of me. I came in close to closing time with a nail in my tire. The nail was too close to the side of the tire to be repaired and he first asked if I wanted to put on the spare, then recommended some comparable tires. I did a quick price check online and found the price was the same as at the store. I was in and out fast, which I appreciated on a Sarurday afternoon! I also like the free airchecks.

Love, love, love this place! Pretty reasonable price for gel nails, which I also love. These nails are destruction proof as long as they are done right. My nails can go without chipping for a minimum of three weeks and I've gone a month without tending to them and they still looked great. I've had friends who have gone to high end salons to get shellac/gel and had their nails chip before mine. I always go with a friend and we can seriously be in and out in less than 30 minutes with amazing results. Be forewarned that this place is super busy on Friday and the weekend, but they definitely can speed through clients without sacrificing quality.

Nom nom nom. I think that encapsulates my entire review for Tacos Atoyac. I've been there three times now (I wanted to make sure this place was consistently awesome) and each time has been delicious. My recommendations: absolutely hit up the fish tacos and the Oaxacan hot dog.   The fish tacos are fantastic - lightly battered, crunchy, crisp and tasty (yeah for being well-seasoned!). Add a little bit of lime and sprinkle with the generous side of onions they provide and you've got yourself a fantastic dinner. The portion sizes here are a bit small, but reflective of the prices. The regular tacos are all $1.   The Oaxacan hot dog - grilled bun, beans, lettuce, avocado, mayo, bacon and some other items that I'm missing. So, so delicious. The only minus is that they use a pretty standard hot dog. I'd love for them to use a better quality dog, but at the price, I understand. And the toppings are fantastic. Definitely try different things. The prices are very conducive to trying different things.

I'm totally blown away by this place. First off, the gelato is delicious. We had the salted caramel and the cheesecake flavors and they were on point in terms of flavor. The two scoops we got were also packed into the cup rather than just being little round scoops like at other gelato places, so I feel like we get more for the money.  Even more awesome, the workers here are indeed ridiculously nice, as other reviewers have noted. When we sat down, a worker offered us cups of water (I've never been offered water at any gelato/yogurt establishment), then later another worker came by offering free hot chocolate samples. Also, when we first walked in, the worker said that we could try any and all flavors and she seemed to mean it. We will be back to take her up on that offer!

I had a 60 minute acupressure massage with Alexis and I was really impressed. She asked questions about my preferred pressure, past illnesses, problem areas, etc. and really listened to my answers and incorporated my preferences into the massage. These seem like pretty basic questions for a massage, but I've had plenty of massages where the masseuse just dove right in without asking anything. The massage was very thorough and very relaxing, although she did have to focus on a couple of hard to manage knots in my upper back. The oil she used at the end of the massage was very relaxing. Definitely give Juniper a try!
