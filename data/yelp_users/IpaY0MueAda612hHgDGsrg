Out of all the korean bbq resturants in the east side I think Hodori is the best.  Thier Balgogi is flavored really well.  I always have the get the jap chai noodles there.  I'm usually seatted quickly, but it might take a little while for my food to be ready. & the metal chops sticks that when they bang on my teeth are no fun.  But the food is good and that's why i keep on comming back.  It's a great way to eat family style too.

This is the best authentic thai place in arizona.  Hands down.  try the papaya salad w/ crab. pad see eww is good too.  one thing that isn't on the menu that you can order is the beef jerky, the name doesn't do it justice but if you know about thai food you'll thank me later.  it's really one of those hole in the wall places and everyone knows that's where teh good food really are.  because of the location it really doesn't get as much traffic as it should.

One of the best thai resturants in AZ.  I love thai food and will drive out of the way to eat a good one.  But luckily for me this one is in my naighborhood.  Three good dishes that they have are the drunken noodle, the lettuce wrap & the mussels (yuphia basil).  the mussels are unique and you should try it.  I've never had it anywhere else prepared this way.  give it a try.

Mussels didn't live up to description. Food was plain even though I ordered my dishes spicy. Totally Americanized, which means it's more bland. Waitress was pleasant & the atmosphere was nice. But for flavor it totally failed.

Good Food, Great presentation.  the atmosphere is nice enought to take a date.  The hostess Teresa is really friendly.  I suggest the pho of course, and the chicken wings and if you still have room the che thai dessert #19 I think ......sooo good.

Good service.  Delicious Food.  Besides the good pho I always like to get the meat over lettice.  I don't know what it's called but theres a picture of it on the menu and i just point to it.

The wait is a little bit long if u have a larger 6+ group. But it is a small place. The food is worth waiting for, we've been back a few times & everything we had was good. The clam chowder.... Soo F'n good.
