I came here looking to have my bridesmaids try on dresses. I'd called before hand to make sure they had the right dresses in stock and they said they did. But when I arrived, they couldn't find the dresses, the girl who was supposed to help me had no idea where to even find the section for a certain designer (their area of BM dresses was not that large), and when they gave up looking, they just left me. Didn't say they couldn't find them or that they weren't in stock. Then when I complained that they had said they had them on the phone, they blamed me and said I must not have said bridesmaid dresses when I asked on the phone. They were rude, unprofessional and I will never recommend them.

The food was ok, but the atmosphere and service was less than stellar. The median age of the diners, at 8pm no less, was about 60. The waiter left us alone after bringing drinks taking our order for what seemed like 30 minutes, before telling me that what i ordered was 86ed. That was all fine and good, but when i re-ordered the turkey sandwich, that's not what brought me. It was a chicken sandwich and was missing it's main condiment to boot. I got a side of whatever was supposed to go on it, but I didn't realize the it was chicken instead of turkey until later, and by then, it was so late and everyone else was practically done eating, so i let it go. Overall, the food wasn't anything special and the service is definitely under-par

This isn't the worse place I've been. In fact the pedicure was really pretty good, but the manicure chipped the very next day! They aslo gave me a kind of hard time about paying with card, even though i tipped in cash. I only went here for a wedding and i don't think I'll be going back.

I wanted to check this place out for nice colored paper that would be used to make escort cards for my wedding. When i went it, i defintiely liked all the stuff they had there, but it took them forever to even acknowledge me. Someone finally said hi from behind the counter, but didn't ask if I needed anything and seemed more interested in what she was doing behind the counter. I made it to the back where they had racks of paper, but i wasn't seeing what i wanted. A few more sales ladies came into the store from the back and one asked if she could help me. Finally!  I explained that I was looking for thick but pretty card stock to use for cutting out bird silhouettes for my escort cards. As this sentence was leaving my mouth, the look on her face changed to absolutely disgust. When i finally got through asking if she'd be able to help me find the right paper, or any suggestions on how to make this work, she said "Yeah, don't cut out bird shapes! It's going to look homemade and you'd be better off just buying some colored feathers." And that was it. At no point did she offer to point me to a different paper, or discuss the possibility of bird shaped stamps. No, no. You're idea is trashy and gross and the thought of talking to you anymore about it makes me want to vomit.  The reviews about them being snotty and rude are absolutely true. I would never step foot in this store again.

Though a couple of hiccups could've ruined the night, Roaring Fork took great care of my boyfriend and me and the food was delicious to boot (ha, boot. Get it? cuz it's western? Never mind).  We were surprised at how busy they were on a Tuesday night, but we were able to snag a table on their beautiful covered patio. The atmosphere was nice, and i was surprised at the range of patrons (a family of 5 with 3 fairly young children at one table, and a 10-top of blue hairs right next to us). Our server Charlie was very nice and helpful when it came to selections (from wine to food). We are trying out places in prep for a family visit, so we want to make sure we get a good sapling of the menu.  We ordered a bottle of sauv blanc, and though the wine was delicious, it took about the half the meal for Charlie to bring out the marble chiller. Thankfully the wine started out pretty cold, so no harm no foul. I orderd a bowl of tortilla soup (one of my faves) and I was impressed witht he presentation and taste. The bring the bowl with the chicken and tortilla strips out then pour the broth from a pot right at your table. Helps keep the tortilla strips crisp and was a great presentation. The soup was delicious, though a little creamier than i normally like my tortilla soup. We also ordered the seared ahi with guac and THAT was amazing. The pepitas crackers were delicious and interesting and the ahi was perfect. Great app for sure. Plus, the bread and butter were super delicious too. Garlic biscuits, mini corn bread and pepper butter? so good!  For entrees the boyfriend ordered the bacon wrapped pork loin over grits and I ordered the signature Dr. Pepper BBQ Baby Back Ribs. We subbed fries for asparagus and green beans and ordered an extra side of their green chile mac and cheese. I know, a lot of food, but we planned on taking most of it home. Here's where it got interesting. Or should I say, boring.   So far everything (except the chiller) had been delivered timely and was tasty. But when we realized we'd been waiting 30 mintues or so for our entrees to come (after they'd taken away our apps), it started to get a little annoying. After about 40-45 mintues, the manager came over and leet us know our tray of food had been dropped and had to be re-made. No problem! I understand accidents happen. But i think it would've done a lot to smooth us over if they'd told us right away the spill had happened rather than waiting until we were about eat the burger off the table next to us. RF did recognize the inconvenience though and completely took care of us when the bill came. So props to them for that, and we didn't even complain or ask for any special treatment.  When the food finally arrived, the ribs were OUTSTANDING. the sauce was perfect, not to sweet, not to flat. And the meat was literally falling off the bone. The veggies were all good, but the really show-stopper was the mac and cheese. The crumble top was delicious and the cheese was melted and runny but not stringy or clumpy. Spicy from the green chiles but perfectly reasonable. I want another kettle of them right now. So good. The boyfriends dinner was also good, but i think my ribs and the mac and cheese were really the best part.  We boxed everything up and ordered the huckleberry bread pudding to go. I was disappointed they no longer do the pineapple upside down cake, which so many yelpers have recommended, but I loved the bread pudding as a substitute. the buttery sauce didn't reheat very well at home, but it was still very very good and the ice cream was a perfect complement. I would totally order it again. Like a muffin fresh from the oven, still a little gooey.  Overall, i loved the food and the staff was really apologetic bout the "incident". The atmosphere is great and i would definitely come back. Next time, the burger!

oh wow. What an experience! My boyfriend and I went to Razz's for his birthday on the recommendation of a friend. Thank you Kimberly! The food was amazing and eating up at the bar with Razz himself was the best. We were originally sitting at the bar side of the tasting area, but they moved us over to the kitchen side of the tasting counter as soon as the party that was there left without a complaint! It was great being able to talk to Razz about the food as it was set in front of us and there was so much to talk about. From the amazing grouper belly with black beans and red miso, to the ox tail over polenta with avocado relish, to the seafood beggars pouch in philo with a spicy tomato cream sauce. Everything was delicious and the small tasting portions let you try all these amazing flavors without being uncomfortably full. The wine pairings were also amazing, and that's coming from someone who rarely drinks reds.  All in all, a GREAT experience. I'm holding out on that 5th star for the price. Wish it was a little more affordable. The wines definitely pushed it over the edge.

Caffe Boa's summer menu is out of this world. The maple gazed steak with eggplant was amazing. I devoured it. My boyfriend got the spicy scallops and again, sooooo goooood!   I can't wait to go back and try the squash blossoms and other tasty seasonal dishes. Great service, ambiance and food One of the best restaurants on mill.

I went here with my fiance and his brother while we were on vacation. I love steak and was excited to try a new place. We order the grilled artichoke and bruschetta for an app, then we each had a different steak, with the steak fries and broccoli au gratin for sides. The artichoke was good, but the leaves weren't as meaty as i would've liked. the chipotle aioli was delicious. The bruschetta was very good. Each of our steaks were amazing and cooked perfectly. The bernaise on my NY Sirloin was perfect, and the roasted garlic oozed out and was perfect on my steak. I was so sad that I got too full to finish it. The boys loved their steaks too. The broccoli was ok, and the fries were really good, though the chipotle ketchup it came with was weird.  The service was really awesome, from the busser to the waiter. I would DEFINITELY come here again, but i would try some different apps and sides.

My fiance and I finally checked this place out after hearing so many amazing things about it from friends. There was a bit of a wait, but i think it was worth it, and chilling in the grocery was a perfect way to kill the time!  We shared a delicious salad, the orange fennel, and some ceviche, then had 2 pizzas so we'd be sure to have leftovers to take home. The salad was by far my favorite part of the meal. Absolutely perfect with mandarin oranges, fennel, goat cheese and champagne vinaigrette. To die for. The ceviche was refreshing and tasty and i really enjoyed the wild mushroom party pizza. Several different varieties of fungi, and again, more fennel. The Fallen Angel pizza was good, but i was not expecting the flavor of the sausage.   Overall, we were very impressed with the food and we'll definitely be back.

Cafe Carumba is absolutely one of my favorite places for breakfast. besides a great location, and those awesome brown comfy chairs we always snag, the food is out of this world. I love their veggie omelet and their french toast. Always so good and i think very reasonable in price, considering the area.  I went their for lunch once and they have the best sweet potato fries. I would recommend it for either meal. Amazing.

I love this place! I just started going last month and my nails have never been better. Lee is awesome! She does a great job and really knows her stuff. My nails look super-natural and I never feel pressured to get a new set or a more expensive treatment. The place is big, clean and inviting. None of those tacky 1980s posters on the wall. They offer a lot of services, but so far I've only gotten acrylics there. I get pink&whites using dark pink acrylic. Amazing. I would recommend this place to anyone who's looking, even though they are a bit on the pricey side. You defintiely get what you pay for.

There's really nothing better than breakfast at Chompies on the weekend. With pancakes the size of your head, and the BEST corned beef hash I've ever tasted, why would ever go anywhere else? Their sandwhiches are feats of engineering, and i love that you get delicious dill pickles as soon as you sit down.  Their matzo ball soup has helped through many a hangover and if you're still not sure, try their baked goods! delicious rugelach and other sweet items.   We went to the one on Shea for the Rosh Hashana dinner (delicious and a great deal for a couple of Jews without a large community of Jewish friends), and I have to say I like the University location better. Great ambiance with the posters what not, and the staff is always pleasant and knows how to treat you.  What can i say, I LOVE this place!

This place is great! We sat at the bar and tried the Summer Wine flight. Summer Rain was my favorite. Super light and crisp. Very refreshing! I definitely recommend it for a hidden snack and delicious glass of wine. Their port is also supposed to be very good.

Just got back from my first eyebrow waxing with D'Lisa and she's awesome! I'm in the process of growing out my brows for reshaping and she did a great job cleaning them up and getting them on the path of a great new shape. Efficient and friendly, I'm looking forward to going back for another D'Lisa treatment!

I was excited about trying a new, local breakfast place, and I have to say the Breakfast Joynt didn't disappoint. There was a bit of a wait when we got there, but it moved really quickly and the server and hostess were both extremely friendly! I had fresh squeezed OJ (so delicious) and their California Benedict. The hash browns were pretty good, and the benny was very tasty, except 1 of the eggs was overcooked. The other one was perfectly poached and deliciously runny. Their hollandaise is homemade and the bacon was amazing. The fiance got chicken fried steak and i could stop stealing little bites. the gravy was to die for!  For a local "dive" it was really good, though they did seem a little unorganized and i really do hate it when the eggs in your benedict are overcooked. For that, i have to dock a star.

I wish i had Yelped about this place sooner. I've since mostly forgotten what i ate there.  My boyfriend took me here for my brithday and I can't say enough good things about it! The ambiance was awesome. Very chic and friendly. I loved the open kitchen, but if you sat at a table, it wasn't distracting. The service was fantastic. the waiter was extremely helpful and explained everything.  We got 7 courses and we're pretty adventurous so we chose "chef's choice" - no restrictions on the protein. It was delicious. I loved that we both got different items so we could share and essentially eat 14 different dishes. What I remember enjoying the most was the kangaroo, the scallops, the cheese and the spare ribs. Phenomenal!!!!! The dessert was also great and if you go for an occasion, you can write your secret message on your food selection card for them to write in chocolate sauce on the dessert plate.  I really can't say enough good things about this place. You definitely want to go with people you enjoy, since you you'll be there for a good period of time. Probably not the best first date place since if you're miserable, it's hard to make small talk for 2 hours.   If you're looking for a dining experience, you have to try Posh. The food is delicious and you'll be telling people about it for weeks. I can't wait to go back and try new items.

Soooooo goooood!!!!!!!!!!! My fiance and I went here for the first time a couple weeks ago. The girl at the counter was extremely helpful in explaining their options, and you get soooooo much soup for the price! I have to admit, i liked my fiance's better, so i'm definitely going to try it next time. I had the house broth, and it was very good, a little spicy. He had the broth that was a little more milky and it was very good, especially after adding a little sriracha. I highly recommend them if you're in the mood for some delicious comfort food.

Went here for a Wednesday happy hour and found a great new spot for drinks and tapas! After a few attempts at finding a refreshing, crisp, dry white wine, my friend and i settled on their white sangria. It was delicious. I would've preferred a nice Sauv Blanc, but the sangria was fruity and not too sweet, so it worked out. Their snacks were delicious! We tried the artichokes and clams and the serrano ham with manchego cheese. Very tasty and during happy hour, a great deal! I'm looking forward to going back and trying more of their tapas plates and a glass of their red sangria or a nice Spanish wine.  And if you do find a wine you enjoy, Wednesdays are 1/2 price bottles!  Overall the decor was really nice and everyone was very friendly. I saw their patio through a door, but didn't get outside to check it out up close. I will say that their bar stools are not very comfortable.

First things first - the margaritas are delicious. Simple and classic, they are the types of 'ritas that have you downing 3 before you realize it. They are smooth and tart and refreshing. I haven't tried it with any other tequila on their HUGE list, but someday I'll know enough to do that.  The snacks are also very good, especially the onion rings and pork tacos. I want to roll around in that spicy aioli they give you with the onion rings. Amazing.  Also delicious - the chipotle salsa. Perfect amount of spice.  the only thing i can say is less than stellar is the education on the tequilas. I'm sure they are just getting their bearings, but I appreciate a good lesson on liquor, and with this much to choose from, I definitely need guidance. I'd bet they'd get a lot more upgrades on those margaritas if they were able to recommend a few other tequilas from their extensive list.   But this has become my favorite place for a chill drink after work. The vibe and decor is awesome, so i highly recommend it for happy hour!

I've never considered myself a connoisseur of gelato. I've had it once or twice and never been bowled over. until i had Frost gelato. It's a heavenly flavor explosion in my mouth. I combined 2 flavors into a delicious mixture that tasted like creme brulee. But sampling all the other flavors was just as great! they have such a wide selection and deciding was really the toughest part. Their Bellini and strawberries and champagne sorbet was also to die for. They were creamy and rich, but contain no dairy! How do they do that?! I recommend trying a frost bite while you're there as well. A small dollop of gelato surrounded by chocolate. What could be better? I'm so excited the Frost is open in the Valley, i just wish they had more locations than just Gilbert. It's a far drive for me, but totally worth it!
