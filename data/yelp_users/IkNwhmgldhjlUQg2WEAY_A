I haven't found a Mexican restaurant that compares yet.   Salsas are hot, so be sure you have your water before you indulge. My favorite is the hot green, but they offer 4 varieties of salsas.   The shredded beef is good. The chicken is always good - all white meat! The ground beef is yummy too, but not my first choice.   My favorites are the enchiladas, the taco salad and also the tacos.   A weekly craving! And the best happy hour around, as it is daily from the late afternoon until 7pm.

I've been to the location in Tempe, which is typically pretty good. This one was terrible. We ordered the "pot stickers"... supposedly precooked and then pan fried. I will tell you that the chicken was raw and the dough was chewy. We made one complaint, and the waitress assured us that they were "cooked." Then after cutting into another, the chicken continued to be under done and pink. We sent those back, and waited at least another 20 minutes for our main meal. That was just mediocre -The Southwest Chicken sandwich.   Will say the beer was good as usual.

The new lasers are amazing! I started going here for laser on my under arms and bikini with Kylie. I've seen great results. I also bought a six package deal. I am just about complete with my package, and my laser tech told me up front that it would take much more than the six treatments because hair grows at different rates. They have new lasers now and I'm seeing much better results. I don't expect to go to too many more treatments!   I love this place. They have appts on Saturdays too. I'm thinking about my next service, maybe botox. They have so much to offer.

I had a great experience. I stopped in not really knowing what time it was, and they took me right away. I arrived before they even opened, oops. What great service to get me started to soak while they finished setting up. It's a little hidden in the strip mall, but clean, and affordable. Since this place is under new management there was a special for a manicure and pedicure for $30! Well worth it. I will be going back and am telling all my friends to go there too. I really liked that the owners asked me questions and got to know me. I felt like I was one of the family.  :)
