A solid lunch. They have a daily lunch special for $5.50 and all the other lunch items are $5.75. Well worth it. I will go back for sure.

Great lunch. I went here with a friend from work because of a BOGO coupon he had. The lunch was fantastic. I had a rice bowl with raw fish on top with mixed seeweed and mushrooms mixed in. The flavor was just right with enough savory sauce and sticky sweet rice. The fish on top was perfectly cut into cubes and plenty of it. I liked it a lot.

This is my place for great thin crust NY style pizza. Fast, cheap and super yummy. My whole family loves this place. We usualy get a cheese pie and a sausage pie. Both are 18'' $13 for the cheese pie and an extra two dollars for the extra topping. We get our pizza here every Friday.

I am now forced to be Gluten Free, Chipotle is a good option because everything is GF here except the flour shells (burrito or taco). They have corn taco shells though. I get a bowl and its great.

This place is next to my favorite chineese place. I tried it for lunch and had the Green Curry. It was $7.95 and I am full. This place has what you want. It is very good food, good service and its a clean quiet atmosphere. I like it very much and I will continue to go there.

I am a fan. This small taco shop that is family owned is just the right kind of place to go for lunch for some fast very good Mexican food. Don't go in thinking that its going to be a sit down place that will serve you. This is more like a indoor food truck. the food is fresh all the ingredients were fresh as well. No you don't get chips and salsa as you would expect from a food truck kind of place. The burritos are very tasty and large. If their burritos don't fill you up then you need to go to a buffet and just pig out. I will go back for sure and order the tacos (they street tacos so yes they are the small ones) they are soooooo good. And no they do not charge you to use the salsa bar, that is not true. i recommend that you try, you will like it.

I got a piece of red velvet cake. The frosting is so rich and creamy with a very buttery finish and LOTS of cream cheese. The cake is tasty but dry. Good thing there was lots of amazing frosting to cover that flaw up. The place looked like a trendy spot you would find in NYC with prices to match. The staff was super friendly though.

The very best breakfast in town. VERY big portion and the atmosphere is great, farmhouse kitchen table. Five stars for every aspect of my first trip there. I promise you will not regret it. If you go on the weekend you will wait in line to get in, but they have a patio that you might get in faster if you are willing to sit outside. When you write your name on the list put next to is Patio and you will get seated faster.

yea I am a real big fan. This place makes their own bread and if you love a good sandwich you know that is the most important thing.... they nailed it. The prickly pear sandwich is really good. Be sure to get some extra green chili mayo to go on it. I get the fries with it because they are super crispy (even after driving home with them in the to-go container). I would very highly recommend Flancers for something different and delicious.

I had a very good experience at AutoNation Hyundai Tempe. My sales person was Tye Heinrichs. He was very professional with every aspect of the sale and has made it very clear that his only concern is the customer. His customer service is unmatched and is what is missing from the auto industry as a whole. I would recommend this dealer and specifically Tye for any of your auto needs.

Woohoo is right. These donuts are AWSOME! I will for sure return for my next donut binge. My favorites were the old fashioned glazed, and the maple bar. The bear claw was not worth it. The apple fritter is worth it. If you are near a Bosa then get some donuts.

Its Panda Express, what did you expect. If the food is fresh then its good. I was not very impressed with this particular location as the service is not good and the food seems to always be old. Just go somewhere else unless you are desperate for chewy orange chicken.

This is my favorite place to get my groceries, salsa, tortillas, chips and uummm EVERYTHING. On the weekends they often have a mariachi band playing in the Cafe area which is a treat for my kids to see and hear. The prices cannot be beat anywhere. The diversity of grocery foods along with unique items will blow you away. The staff is very friendly and professional. I only shop here and will continue to do so soon. I have heard great things about the cafe but have not had the chance to try yet. Your definitely need to give this place a try. And buy something you have never had before, there's  lots of that to choose from here.

Do NOT go here. My oil and tire rotation (i had and appointment) took 2 hours. And they did not do the full inspection of the rest of the vehicle. The price for the oil change was $35 for a Tahoe. Just dont go. That is all.

I purchased Firestone tires in New Jersey and have the "nationwide warranty" that I paid extra for. I had a flat and went in to get it fixed here and they charged me 21.47 to put a patch on my tire. The do not honor the Firestone warranty. The service was fast and good but I was not happy with the warranty situation. Whats wose is they have a HUGE sign in the waiting room that advertises the nationwide warranty.. BS

Best bagels in town. The texture of the bagels is perfect, they are dense and not a chewy as other bagels. I also like that fact that they make the cream cheese there as well. My favorite is the Honey walnut. You will not be disappointed.

I took my family of 5 (three kids) to Serranos in down town Chandler on a Monday night. The food was very good, the service was outstanding. The kids meals were large enough to fill up my 10 year old son who can eat an obscene amount of food. Also they make a Guacamole Ranch that is AWSOME. With your chips and salsa you can get bean dip and three kinds of salsa before your meal. The prices were very good. Most dishes were under $11.  I will be coming back on the regular.

The first time I went to Serrano's I had a great visit and meal. This time I did not. I ordered the Pollo Ranchero and thought it would be a yummy saucy dish with some spice. What I received was a piece of chicken breast that was baked then chopped and tossed with a little sauce that had no color. It was not a good meal. I could deal with that as it was my choice, but the server came to our table maybe two times. We had to ask the Bus boy for a to go box, our check.. and he even had to ring it up for us. I will try one more time and I hope its not like this again. I will let you know how it goes my fellow Yelpers.

Great mexican that is fresh, fast and good. I love the fish taco tuesday fish tacos for $1.50 (deep fried white fish, corn tortilla, white sauce, cabbage & tomatoes). They have a very good salsa bar; however I do wish they had a hotter salsa on it. If you are in a hurry I would call ahead your order and it will be ready when you get there.

This Costco has a toasted turkey, provolone pesto sandwich on the menu for $3.99... VERY good sandwich. The croud can be pretty thick at lunch time from all the people trying to get free samples, so I recommend going during the week or later on the weekends (after lunch).

This is as close to NY style pizza you will find in any other part of the country. The prices are good and you get a good slice of pie. I liked it a lot. I went for lunch had a calzone that cost $4.99 and it was very good. Sausage, peperoni, onions, mozzarella and ricotta cheese. Highly recommend it. Kids eat free after 4 on Wed.

The food was great, I had the Mole, the service was a little slow with the food but I expect that when its made fresh not scooped from a container then nuked. This will now be the go to place for Mexican food for my family. Our bill for a family of 5 (three kids) was $35.

Joes Farm Grill breakfast tacos. Where have you been my whole life. These three tacos are so good with chicken potatoes eggs and seasoned perfectly. I love the beans that you get with the meal. You will be full after these tacos, they are not extra large but i assure you they are enough for a large man to be full from breakfast. I will be back for them for sure. I think they were about 8 dollars or so.

I had the Mongolian spiced Chopped Salad... It was the best salad I have ever had. Beware that the place is small and if you have a large group eating you will wait a long time to sit down (we waited an hour). I would for sure go back to this location. Our server was great as well.

This place was so cheap and so good. This is how you do it. step up to the counter order from the easy to read menu and pick up your food when its ready (chips & salsa included free). You can get your burrito Fried, Wet (enchilada style) or regular. I recommend the red chili sauce.  I will be back very often.

The food and service has taken a nose dive in the last three trips there. I ordered Brisket Pho and got serloin or something and when I asked for a different dish since I was not happy with that one the waitress argued with me that it was brisket. I didnt need the arguement, I have had the brisket Pho at least ten times it was different. I think I will just go somewhere else now.

Great service, Great food and Great Beer. I had a Heff that was awesome. My server recommended a turkey burger stuffed with cheese, basil, and kalamata olives topped with feta cheese with pesto aioli. AWESOMENESS. The atmosphere in and outside of the restaurant is great. Local shops are very cool and there is outdoor seating with a outdoor bar. The burger was $11 the beer was about $4. I liked it very much and will for sure go back again.

I spent the last two years in Philadelphia and moved here a month ago. Have been to all the greats Jim's, Geno's, Pats and Tony Luke's. Forefathers is not going to beat any of these places, but it is a very nice copy of the originals. The meat is similar but they chop it up into smaller pieces here. Also they put the wiz on the bun and on top so there is good cheese to meat ratio happening. The bun could be more "crusty" for my liking but it did the job. I would recommend this place to anyone that wants to get a good cheesesteak but it will not be the same as the Great ones.

This is a sushi on a rotating belt place. Just pick what you want and pay by the plate. The sushi was ok, you get what you pay for. I liked how clean it was and the service was great. What I could see an improvement on is the amount of cream cheese and california rolls were on the belt. But again you get what you pay for. If i want a cheap sushi fix i would definately go again.

I have been looking for a good NY style Chinese place since we moved here. I FOUND IT. This place is so good, the rice is fantastic, the food is very good. I got it to go so I don't care about the service or that there were kids in the dining room doing their homework.... its a family place.... get over it. The prices are great and the portions are great as well.  This is my new spot for takeout.

You might wait in the lobby for longer than you want to but when you get in to see the Doctor (Dr. Barry) you will be glad you waited. She is going to take as much time as you need to talk not only about what you are there for but anything else you want duing the visit. She is the deffinition of patient CARE. I am glad to have found her. The office staff are all professional friendly people and I dont have much trouble getting in when I need to. Great job.

You will not be disappointed with this place. They kept me informed along the way of what kind of repair they needed to do. Suggested some other work that they could do while certain parts were removed and didn't charge extra labor for that (since they were right there anyway). They do not charge a diagnostic fee, and they truck was done when they said it was going to be. I have to give this place away but its just too good to keep to myself. I will always come back to Family Auto Care for ALL of my repair needs.

I was not a fan of the takeout. The breading is soggy and falls from the meat. The soup was good (hot sour), but everything else we had was not good enough for me to go back. Perhaps if you stay there it would be better. But for takeout I do not recommend this place.

Yes I am a fan. First time here was yesterday at lunch. There was no line, is suspect the reason for no line would be that they are SUPER fast. This place made me a 8" Italian club on a fresh hoagie roll in less than 2 minutes for $5.00. Its a great deal, good ingredients and the lettuce is finley shredded (like any good hoagie place does). I will be back for sure with more people. They deliver too. So get that food delivered when you shouldn't drive but you are REALLY hungry.

I went today Saturday the 10th. We saw the races first and loved it, then we went to the petting zoo that had lots of goats, water buffalo, long hair cattle with the horns and a Texas long horn, all close enough to touch and pet. Then we watched the dock dogs competition and that was so much fun too. After all that we ate Ostrich Jerky, Kangaroo Burger, Aligator on a stick, deep fried pickles, cookie dough, onion rings and snickers. It was such a good time I will be making this a yearly tradition for my family. We all had a GREAT time. I recommend it especially for a family with little kid's took my three kids and they just loved it. Parking was $5, and each food item was an average of $5. It was $10 to get in for the adults and we had coupons to get the kids in free.

The only reason they didn't get a 5 star rating is my extremely high standards for a good hoagie.

I will go back for sure.

I have been back a couple of times and have upgraded my opinion of the place. The service is what has impressed me. I wanted a banana peanut butter cupcake, they didn't have it on the shelf that day, so the guy in the back that makes them hears my request and says "I will make you one right now." well he did and It was awsome. Its a great place to take out of town family or friends. I will continue going here for sure.

If I want great, authentic Chinese food then this is where I will go. If i want to try something adventurous this is where I go. They have great lunch specials that are on the menue, your usual American stuff, orange chicken, some fish dishes, some teriaka stuff. If you want to try something fun then you can ask the waiter to translate some of the specials that are posted on the wall in Chinese. I have never had something I did not like from here. Top marks for service, flavor and adventure.

The crust is thin enough and light airy with the perfect amount of chew. The sauce is the star here and you will enjoy the slightly sweet salty flavor the enhances the real cheese and top quality ingredients. The price is as low as it gets in this part of town and I would highly recommend this place to anyone. It is not a franchise but owned by a guy (Frankie) from Chicago. DO NOT go there expecting a Chicago style pizza, you wont find it here. This is now my neighborhood pizza joint.

This place has Dairy Queen AND Orange Juilus at one location. How great is that? The place is very clean and new with a great staff. Most of the time when you go to Dairy Queen you get slow service from the one or two people trying to run the place, but not here. The prices are standard prices for Dairy Queen and Orange Julius as they are both national chains. This location has a dirve through for the desert hound on the go. I recommend it very much and hope they are here to stay.

I was introduced to Ritas while living in New Jersey. I love this place. It is a treat for your mouth. Real fruit in most of the flavors.  The custard is a real custard..not like the crappy stuff they they sell at Freddie$. This is a rich thick dairy desert that is way more creamy than ice cream or soft serve. A must have.

This is good food. I had the chicken chimichunga meal. It was BOSS. My wife had two carne asada tacos (I'm sure that it's spelled wrong). We are both full and very happy with the food. It's a very small place that is clearly family owned, grandpa is in the dining area, mom and dad are in the kitchen, and the kids are all there too. I felt welcome and not at all intimidated by the huge menu because they have a picture for everything dish. This is my new go to place for awesome Mexican food, that is well priced, delicious and filling.

LOOOOOOOOOOVVVVEEEEEE Popeyes. Great service, good price for the quality of food they produce. I recommend the spicy chicken strips, red beans and rice are bomb, and the cajun fries are crunchy with just the right amount of spice. The best sauce is sweet heat (beware it is pretty hot).
