I stopped going to this location and will start to shop at another local grocery store. The amount of bums outside of the store and people begging for money in the parking lot is ridiculous. The store does nothing to stop this. This is not a safe environment for its customers and that is why I have decided to spend my money elsewhere.

It sucks that Yelp won't let me give this dump less than one star. DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT waste your time at this bar. Nobody goes to this bar. There might be 30 people there when a band plays, but if there is no band the bar is a ghost town. The bar could be cool, but there are like 5 owners who have no business running a bar. Go into the bar on a Friday night and you will know what I mean. The main owner must have deep pockets to keep funneling money into this waste zone. Give up and let somebody else make a good bar in that location. Stop over charging for drinks. It doesn't take a college grad to figure out lower drink prices and hot waitresses bring in paying customers.

Food and service are beyond horrible, but don't skip this place because of that. The beer makes up for everything wrong. Eat at Four Peaks  and have a beer. Then go to Papago and have 2 or 3 beers. Try their orange blossom beer

I wish I could give less than one star. Marquee theater is the worst place to see concerts in the Phoenix area. The owners are so cheap they never turn the ac on. You know something is wrong when in July it is cooler outside than in the venue. This place sucks, overcharges, and should be closed. Does somebody have to die from heat stroke to get the ac turned on. I wonder where my service charges go? I sure can tell you where they don't go

OVERPRICED. Watch out for the losers with tall socks and flipped brims :)

Friday nights at the Baer's Den is a must. How can you beat $10 for all you can drink?

Don't waste your time or money.  I have heard good reviews of this place and gave it a try. The burgers are very, very, very greasy and not flavorful at all. The toppings and bun slide all over when you try to eat the burger. I love a good burger and this place is a complete waste of time. If you want the best burger in the Phoenix area go to The Chuckbox in Tempe. The Chuckbox is 10 times better than this crap place.

I didn't want to like this place, but the food was really good. I had the lumberjack sandwich. I was a little leary on the idea of the food when it came, but after tasting it my mind changed. I won't give up real meat or dairy, but I will try this place again.

DO NOT WASTE your money here. The food is garbage and the place is filthy. If you bought a Groupon for this place and haven't used it yet I suggest regifting it to someone you don't really like. My food was burnt and had no flavor. Tum Nuk Thai is way better spend your money there.

Don't waste your time here the bar won't be open much longer. Service is beyond slow. They do have hot girls working there, but good luck trying to get one to serve you. They are too busy texting or talking to their friends who they feed free drinks too. The bar has the right idea, but just has a poor management team. Bar is heavy on the MMA dbags and Jersey Shore wannabes.

This was my first time ordering a home inspection. Darren, did an excellent job he went above and beyond what I expected. I sure got my moneys worth for the inspection. He explained every step of his inspection to me. Darren, knew all the building codes by heart and could explain everything you wanted to know. If I ever needed another inspection or was going to recommend an inspector I would not hesitate to recommend wright inspections llc.

I hate to say it, but I liked this place better than Ned's crazy sub. I have been going to Ned's since I was a little kid.
