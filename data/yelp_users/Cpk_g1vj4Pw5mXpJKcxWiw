Sat outside on the patio last Friday night - they had a wonderful singer who played everything - not so loud that you couldn't talk though.  The food was wonderful, service was good and the atmosphere was so nice!  Planning to bring a group this weekend!

Hugs n pups is amazing!  I have a VERY SHY border collie.   They were so sweet and patient with her.  When I picked her up I almost didn't recognize her she looked so good! In the five years I have had her she had never looked so beautiful!  I am sold and nunka will be a repeat customer for sure!

Lunch specials are DELICIOUS!  Number 15 is my favorite.   Thai coffee is so good.   Hidden gem in an old plaza!

Clark was wonderful.  He helped me make sure that all of the repairs covered under my warrantee were done.  checked out the my car to see what else need to be done and made reasonable suggestions without being pushy.  He also talked to me about where to renew my warrantee as it expires in 1500 miles.  He even helped me set up the AAA app on my phone so that I always have my card with me.
