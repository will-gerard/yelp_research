Arrived there at 3:48PM today.  Had the VIP done with some detailing and was told it should take around 45 minutes.  Left there at 5:52PM.  They did a good job with the actual cleaning of the vehicle but being grossly mislead on the turn around time was inexcusable and enough to prevent me from coming back or recommending the company to anyone.

Service is quick.  Food is good.  Price is right.  Great for a quick business lunch.

Just got one of the best hair cuts ever from Anthony. Was my first time there but now I can't see myself going anywhere else.
