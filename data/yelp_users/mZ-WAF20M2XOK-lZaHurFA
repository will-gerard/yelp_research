I have gone to Dolce Salon and Spa at the Borgata since 2008 and I have never had a bad experience! I have been going to Level 3 hair stylist, Christina, since I have started going there and she is amazing, I HIGHLY recommend her!

I LOVE MODERN STEAK! The decor is incredible, service is great and for how great the food is--its surprisingly pretty reasonably priced! I would compare the food as good as the food at mastros, dominicks, ruth chris, etc. But the atmosphere and vibe is a bit more casual. I HIGHLY recommend this place!

Although el hefe is known as a "bar" or a place to "sunday funday," they should also be recognized for their AMAZING taco tuesday. They have $2 tacos that are a fairly good size and absolutely delicious! I love this place! Also, be sure to ask for the bartender Sean. He is the best!!!!

I went to Marjerle's Sports Grill in old town scottsdale last sunday and it was by far the worst restaurant experience i've had in a long time, or maybe the worst of ALL TIME.   First off, we sat at a table on the patio and after the server took our drink orders, it took about 30 minutes to actually receive our drinks. Whether it was her fault or the bartenders fault for the delay, she didn't even check on us or apologize for the delay during that entire 30 minutes. When my boyfriend needed a second drink, the waitress was no where to be found so he proceeded to go to the bar to get a drink. The bartender stood on her phone for about 2 minutes texting away. And then proceeded to walk apart my boyfriend waiting at the bar to go continue texting in the back.   For food, we order a side salad and sliders; two menu items that shouldn't take longer than 10-12 minutes. Well, surprisingly, the food came out to us in about 15 minutes. Question was: is the food going to be good? NO ABSOLUTELY NOT. The bun on my 3 sliders were burnt to a crisp. But it doesn't stop there, when I looked at the meat patty of one of my sliders, it looked as if a huge bite was taken out of it! This is when I had enough. I called the waitress over, told her the issues we had, which she apologized for. I told her we didn't want to order anything else and just wanted the bill.   For two rounds of drinks for 5 people, a crappy side salad, and burnt sliders, we paid a whopping NINETY FIVE DOLLARS for what was the WORST dining experience i have ever had. So bad, its almost funny.
