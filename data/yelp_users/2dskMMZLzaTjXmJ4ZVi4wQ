Meh, I don't love this airport. Every time I've come through here is takes forever to get my checked bags, which I suppose is my general gripe with this airport. Otherwise, I think it's pretty nondescript and has crappy wifi. I don't travel to AZ that often so, I'm glad this isn't one of my "regular" airports.

For fast food Mexican I can't complain...I'd rather go to a taqueria, but at 9pm they aren't open :( So, Del taco will do the trick. The people working were nice, or food came fast and everything tasted good (for fast food :)) No complaints for this fast food joint. And Del Taco is cheap :)

I like this place. We just ate there last night. Yum! I got a burrito enchilada stye (totally key if you want it in red sauce with tons of extra cheese :)) I got a bean and cheese burrito. They don't use lard in their beans for any of you vegetarians out there (vegetable oil they claim) and they were good. My hubby got the guacamole burrito with chicken and really enjoyed it. This place is definitely worthy or a return visit. The staff was nice and service was prompt. Plus, we had dinner for the two of us for $19 prior to tip -- which isn't bad for getting waited on :)

I like this place :) I lived in Vegas back in 2002 and would take visitors here before going to the strip. The food is good, the wine is free (not top of the line, but what do you really expect for free?) and the service has always been good.   I just moved back and I thought it was just as I remembered. Great place to have a date :) I got the eggplant parm, which I thought was good. Eggplant can go badly and this one definitely did not!  I still think it's a fun place to eat and will continue to bring my friends here for a meal when they come to visit.

Totally unimpressed with this place. The bread was dry and fell apart as I was eating it...I wonder how old it was.....the cheese was sliced so thin you would hardly taste it, the girl behind the counter went CRAZY with the mustard (and the bread was still dry enough to crumble), None of the veggies had any flavor. Will definitely not get a port of subs sandwich again.

I was so excited when I ordered my eggplant parm sandwich....but it was just disappointing :( There was hardly any sauce on it, the eggplant was overcooked...parts were crunchy and parts were tough and chewy like a tire. The bread was soggy and tasteless....I love subs, and I don't think I'll go back to one of these again..there are too many better places to go.

The service was good, the subs tasted just like the ones I ate in Jersey. Much better than subway. They slice all the meat and cheese when you order the sub, and you can definitely taste the fresh difference!

Yum. We love this place. It's exactly like the one in Royal Oak MI... I guess I never knew it was a chain! The omelets are awesome!! They are absolutely huge, you could probably split it with someone if you wanted. It nice and fluffy (I think because they bake it?) I recommend the veggie one, very good !  The bulgar wheat pancakes rock! I know what your thinking.....but I swear they kick ass and they are good for you (kind of ;)) This place totally owns IHOP! You have to check it out!  Can't wait to try the french toast you are all raving about. I love the omelets so much I have a hard time trying anything else!

Yeah :) Tamales here are awesome :) My husband and I were driving around and decided we would stop when something sounded good for dinner....Mexican sounded good. So, we got our pacificos and ordered some tamales and a burrito. The been burrito was nothing special, but the cheese tamales were incredible!! My hubby really liked the chicken ones as well. We will definitely be back to eat more tamales. They were excellent and made for happy food babies in out bellies :)

We met family from out of town here to eat (since that's where they wanted to go). I've had better, it wasn't awful... but I'm not inclined to go back.  Best things I had:  1) mini carrot cake complete with cream cheese frosting, it was nicely spice and how carrot cake is supposed to be.  2) peel and eat cold shrimp and snow crab legs. The crab was sweet, the shrimp were nicely flavored. They both tasted fresh and not fishy.  3) fresh fruit the melon, strawberries and pineapple were all juicy and flavorful.  Mediocre things: 1) steamed veggies....they were a little on the soggy side.  2) tiramisu cup, there was hardly any lady finger in it :( that's the best part!  3) cappuccino mouse, very rich....but a lot of clear brownish fluid was in a pocket in it....not sure if it just wasn't mixed good or what?  4) black beans, they're kind of hard to screw up :)  Could have been okay but.....  1) Chili Relleno. The cheese filling was good, but there was wayyyyy too much breading on it which did nothing but retain too much grease....if there would have been less breading and not as greasy this would have fallen in the category above.  2)peanut butter cream puff. Dry, kind of defeats a "cream" puff.  Yuck:  1) crab salad....I don't know if it was imitation crab meat, or old crab... but this was fish and gross...the crab was also rubbery.  2) California roll, ewww gross. I actually spit this out into my napkin. It was so fishy it made me gag a little before I spit it out!  3) mac n cheese pretty bland and gooey....I think maybe they made it with generic velveta?  So, that's the run down of what I ate, about all I could fit in my tummy. So, in my opinion stick to the peel and eat shrimp and crab :) Not sure about the other meats because I don't eat it.....my hubby said they were okay, not the best, not the worst. He pretty much agrees with me on the "Meh. I've experienced better"

So, I had to get my fingerprints taken for a nursing license and I went to this place. The staff was great!! Everyone was friendly and nice. They were quick and efficient. I didn't wait at all! Plus this place only charges $15 vs the $40 they charge at the LV police place. There's plenty of parking. It's a the Smiths strip mall of the SE corner of Sahara and Maryland.

I was soooo disappointed :( I had high hopes for this place. I lived in Chicago for a few years and was happy to learn there was a Chicago style pizza place. Sadly, it does not compare to the pizza I would eat in Chicago. The sauce on the stuffed pizza tasted like it was just tomato sauce out of a can. There was absolutely NO seasoning in it. The spinach was fresh, but it wasn't completely covered by the sauce, so many of the pieces were dried out. The cheese was okay, but not great. The crust was pretty nondescript. I definitely won't get another stuffed pizza from here. If they use the same "sauce" on the thin pizzas I definitely won't get pizza from here again.

Yum! Great menu, lots of choices. The sandwiches are giant like a deli sandwich should be. I'm anxious to go back and have a breakfast there :) The bagels are awesome, like bagels are supposed to be....nice, dense and with great flavor. Will definitely come back to this place for more bagel sandwich goodness!!

Yum! We went here for dinner tonight and really enjoyed it! We had the coupon from the internet for 2 free glasses of wine which is always nice!  Let me preface this with I can not spell, so please forgive me if I spell the dishes wrong!  The hummus was good, the pita bread was great and warm, not burned or dry. The consistency of the hummus was smooth, probably thanks to the yogurt it's made with.  I have the spanakopita plate (spinach pie) which I thought was very good. Great balance of phyllo dough, spinach and feta. It was nice to have the plate because it came with rice, a small greek salad (which was good - lots of feta, good salty kalamata olives and nice oil and vinegar dressing) and a taste of hummus (we had gotten an appetizer of the hummus as well...we love hummus).  My hubby had the chicken gyro and really enjoyed it. You can pick was dressing you want on the sandwich, which is nice (tsatziki, hummus or something else).  We also had a side plate of the falafel, which was really good! They were small little falafel balls, but the texture was really nice. Very smooth with a great flavor!   The service was good and quick, the place was clean and the food was good. We will definitely come back here again!

I used to frequent the original C&A when I lived here in 2002. I just moved back to town and to my delight, found there are now 2!  My husband and I checked out the little C&A and had a nice time. Our beer was good and cold, the bartender was nice and beautiful. The fish and Chips were good, and the patrons were playing great music from the juke box the whole time....how could you not like the place?  Definitely not quite the atmosphere of the big one, but it accomplished all of it's pub duties, plus I don't have to drive through the strip to get there now that I live in the NW. The other one is easy to get to from Green Valley (where I lived before)

Yea!!! I love this place :) They have great deals on produce and other food items. It doesn't have the widest variety, but I'd rather go here than anywhere else to shop. I'll try to change my menu so I don't have to go other places. I'm one of those people that loathes grocery shopping, but I like to go here. You have self check out, it's not busy and things are displayed nicely so you can see the prices and know what you're getting. Definitely a fan, I will only go to other stores if they don't have things that I need here :) Plus, they have a place you can drop off cans, plastic bags and plastic bottles to be recycled. I wish they took glass too!

We had a really wonderful dinner here....and not only because our waiter could easily have been a model... he was lovely and sadly I've already forgotten his name. I digress...   While I was in town for a conference we heard this place was awesome. On a side note, the bathroom is super cool... We ate out on the patio & they are so nice they even set down cloth napkins for us to set our purses on (is this an out west thing?) Anyhow, we all ordered various specialty drinks and we were all pleased with out choices. We started off with the quac, which they make table side. It was delicious and the chips were also good. The quac is spicy because they do put jalapenos in it if you like (which we did!). I had Mahi tacos because after the quac and late lunch I wasn't particularly starving. The tacos were delicious. If you are starving, this would probably not be enough food for you, but perfect for a light meal. My dining companions were also pleased with their meals. The service was great and we never felt rushed or hurried, and they had just the right amount of attentiveness. I would eat here again if I ever roll through town again.

I was just in Pittsburgh for a conference and randomly mentioned my love of Pierogis to my friend who lives there. So, of course when we had a hot minute for lunch she brought me here. I haven't had a real pierogi in ages and these certainly did not disappoint. SO good and swimming in a little pool of butter. They had several other items I wanted to eat (the vegetarian platter) but I had to restrain myself since I would be eating dinner again in 3 hours.... Anyhow, if you are in Pittsburgh & in the mood for a pierogi (if you're not in the mood you should be! get on these pierogis asap!) definitely swing by this place. Not too pricey, cash only if your bill is less than $10. 4 pierogis for $4. So.Good!

Okay, so this isn't the best pizza you will ever eat, but you can't beat the five dollar dandy (as we call it) I'm from Michigan, which is where this chain (and dominoes) started and I can honestly say that the crazy bread here taste more like it originally did that a lot of the sleezers back in MI. For the money you just can't beat it. They have $5 large pepperoni and cheese only pizzas ready and waiting for you. We've been to this one a number of times and the pizzas are always good, never taste like they've been sitting forever. If you've never had a sleezers pizza before I'll tell you what they are like...the crust is on the thin side (and isn't the best cold, if you like the left overs definitely want to nuke it or put it in the oven) the cheese is good and the sauce has a nice unassuming flavor. Highly recommend some crazy bread to accompany your pizza. There is some nice garlic butter on it and cheese sprinkled on.....if you really adventurous go for the Italian cheese bread....it is quite a delight! So, go forth and have you five dollar dandy!!

Miles & miles of trails & so close to the city. This is a great place to go if you want to get away for a day. There are trails easy enough that you could bring some kiddos with you. I did see a few trail runners also, so if you're looking for some dirt this is your place. We were here in March when all the cactus were blooming, so it was really quite prettying. Love seeing all the giant cactus, which are what I tend to see in my mind when I think of AZ. We got some lovely pictures & even saw a Mojave Green rattlesnake! He went right across our path & was definitely not timid, scared us half to death actually. So, if your in AZ and don't have the time to make it to the Grand Canyon or some of the other large parks this is an easy place to get to for some hiking just outside Phoenix.

Okay, Let me just say....I'm not sure if it was food poisoning, or I coincidentally came down with a stomach bug 4 hours after eating their pizza.....but after my 36 hour adventure with my toilet and the bathroom floor, I can't say I'm willing to give this place another shot....not to mention the pizza really wasn't even worth my misery.  So, the pizza itself. I got the spinach trio (comes with spinach, tomato and feta cheese). It was a thin crust pizza, and there was waaaaaayyyyyyy too much mozzarella on this thing. The cheese was at least 1/4 inch think. This wouldn't be a problem it it was on an appropriate thickness crust. The poor thin crust just couldn't hold up all that cheese and was floppy and soggy. The was also a strange smokey flavor to the pizza, which I just don't get. Plus, there was hardly any spinach at all on the pizza.   On the plus side, the girl working the counter was very peppy and nice.   So, if your going to try this place, I recommend skipping the spinach trio...maybe it was the feta that poisoned me.....good luck, I hope you have a better experience that I....if you're the brave type.

We got the calzones here. The dough was good, but there was waaaayyyy too much Ricotta cheese in them. I'm a huge fan of cheese, so for me to say that is saying a lot. I'm tempted to give this place another chance and try the pizza, but the prices are a little steep....I mean it's pizza, it shouldn't cost 50 buck! I'm glad we had a coupon from restaurant.com We'll probably give it another try for pizza when we get another coupon. From what I've had, I don't think this place is worth the price, I'd rather get a cheap whole costco pizza.
