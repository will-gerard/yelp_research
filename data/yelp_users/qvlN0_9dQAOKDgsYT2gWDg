The worst Mexican my girlfriend and I have ever had! Just thrown together. Couldn't find our enchilada in the mess of beans, rice and whatever. Greasy hard shell tacos, they sucked. And to top it all off.... EXPENSIVE!. Don't even bother wasting your time and money.

Wasn't too impressed first time around, thought I'd give it a second chance. I'm writing this review from my toilet, I know not too classy, oh well, trying to get the message across. I ate dinner there just about an hour ago, five minutes ago I was doubled over with the worst stomach cramps that I can remember. The food was subpar, oily, low quality Mexican, yuck. I will never go back! Eat there at your own risk!
