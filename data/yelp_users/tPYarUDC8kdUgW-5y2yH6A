If you're looking for consistent quality in every respect, this is your place. From the interior design and materials to the quality of ingredients and preparation to seamless service, Hillstone excels. All you give up is a high level of creativity. That being said: it is the most consistent restaurant in Phoenix and the most admired by restaurateurs.  My go to: Loup de Mer or Yellowtail Sashimi.

They recently switched to CAB for the filet and it is utterly amazing. Consistently tender and flavorful. A great value compared with major steakhouses, too.

Kai is certainly an AZ treasure. I had forgotten how really great the place is, but had the opportunity to dine there again recently. What sets it apart is the seamless quality of the food and service.  With regards to food, it is loosely variations on native american fare. However, there are lots of luxury twists, such as seared foie gras, escargot, etc. We chose to order individual dishes, but there are two extensive tasting menus that can be paired with wine. Perhaps the most beautiful was a composed salad "From the Garden". The mains we enjoyed most were the "Coriander-Sumac Spiced Rack of Lamb" and "Grilled Tenderloin of Tribal Buffalo", which we ordered mid-rare.  The cocktails were outstanding. I had a riff on an old fashioned which and they also sampled us the "Smokey Almond" which I would certainly recommend. The wine list is extensive and tends to be pricey, but the wine service itself is perfect.  Service is a level above anything else I've experienced in Arizona. The attitude is one of graciousness and a peaceful pace, without dragging. The team is very well coordinated, bring out the dishes simultaneously. One never needs to ask for anything as they anticipate your needs. Lots of meaningful touches add up. For instance, the coffee is served table side as either french press or ceramic drip. When you go to you car, you find signature chocolates, Voss water and a handwritten thank you note from the waiter.

The food merits 2 stars and the service was an absolute zero.  Side note: 20 years ago, this was perhaps the busiest restaurant in the Valley and had Brinker's then famous level of training and service.  The place looks about the same with faux Tuscan dinner house look and Italian lessons in the restrooms. Everything else has gone in the crapper.  We were there with a party of 10 to celebrate an anniversary at lunchtime. The place was virtually deserted (at 12:30p on a Sunday) and yet we were seated at the "wrong" table and reseated in the very back room.  Our server came huffing and puffing to greet us muttering and flustered that we were here (not sure why customers are seen as an inconvenience in such a slow place). He reluctantly brought water glasses and later brought some of the complimentary bread. Muttering about our being early (not true) instead of drawing of sappy sayings with crayons on the white craft paper that covers the tables. We were afraid to ask for ice from our water: we didn't want him to crack or go postal.  He brought out the house "wine", which is "chianti" from California. It is only one step up from Pompeii brand red wine vinegar.  Much later, he took our order. Each person was greeted with a terse "next!". Don't ask for changes or ask questions, please!  After another great span of time (in which we were left unattended, which in this case was better), the food came out. My Pasta Milano was only warm enough that I could eat it. I would have sent it back at a reasonable place. The "garlic cream sauce" was light on the garlic but completely overpowered by rosemary (which was not mentioned on the menu). A brave guest did send back their lukewarm pizza, which brought forth the scorn of the server.  The waiter did warm up when he heard one of the guests speak of real estate (but not addressed to the waiter). He began interjecting his opinion on mortgages and the real estate market. Wow! No interest in serving people, but a veritable talking head when it comes to residential real estate.  Anyhow, we were able to escape eventually, shaking our heads in disbelief.

Really lackluster experience here. Upon entering, we were met by bored employees chatting with each other. One finally noticed us and guided us to our table. Seated, we were able to look around and check out the place. The place does the brasserie look pretty well, but is marred by music which has no relevance to the decor and menu.  Service is just okay and the food was sloppily prepared. My skate wing was barely pan saut√©ed (basically white with very little browning) and just past raw. Our salads were uninspired.   While in the same category as Bouchon, it is compares poorly in every way. Head to the Venetian and go with Bouchon.

This is my fourth review. I am happy to say that the food was much better. The boudin blanc breakfast special was very good and the croissant perfect. The only issue is forgetful service that kept us asking for various items and meant that the temperatures were not as stove hot as if the waiter had been paying attention to his orders. Training could definitely be improved for front of the house staff.

I am not a pinball expert or player, but the Pinball Hall of Fame is a treasure. First of all, there is no entry fee. I thought it would be something of a museum, but it is really a huge arcade with machines from the 40's 'til today. The only money you pay is the coinage you use to play the games. By the way, they can change singles, but not large bills, so bring coins or one's. You can play any of the old games that are turned on.  If you have any interest in pop culture or art or Americana, you will be fascinated by the machines from the various eras. The art on the playing deck as well as on the back glass is worth studying. The progression of the games from no flippers, to flippers, to all sorts of craziness is interesting to track. There are other games such as steam shovels filled with lentils and spinning helicopters. Expect so spend at least an hour to an hour and a half.  Should you be a pinball person, this has to be heaven.

A very concise, well designed museum that covers a scary/bizarre/reality topic. It is an affiliate of the Smithsonian and it shows in the quality of the place. Atomic testing is such a quirky topic filled with emotion: horror and fascination. The museum does a great job of juxtaposing these emotions while presenting the history of atmospheric and underground testing. Lots of hardware from that era combined with video presentations and personal stories. Particularly interesting are the views of people, such as tourists who actually enjoyed watching atmospheric tests from outside the casinos. It is very thought provoking while giving great insight into an unusual chapter of US history.

***First of all: This was the best meal of our lives.*** I would give it six stars, if allowed to. It was also one of the most expensive (by quite a bit).  My wife and I had eaten at Guy Savoy's original restaurant in Paris and thoroughly enjoyed it, so we had high hopes for the Las Vegas location. This location is in Caesar's Palace and is supervised by Guy's charming son. It is located in a quiet part of the place with an understated dining room from which a perfect view of the "Eiffel Tower" at Paris, Paris may be seen. It is oddly transporting in that bizarre Vegas sort of way. The seating density is VERY low, which is great. When loud talkers wearing gold chains and other bling chat, you really cannot hear them. The clientele is a mixture of gauche high rollers, foodies, and special occasion sorts.  Quality and service here are impeccable. The meal starts with the champagne cart which has a dozen offerings by the glass. Where we live, you are lucky to find a basic champagne by the glass, much less an assortment of top tier houses. The bread cart has a dozen and half kinds of bread from walnut bread to a seaweed bread. There are two kinds of butter from Normandy: a salted and unsalted version.  The menu is organized as a tasting menu or one may order ala carte. We chose ala cart and ordered three course, which included Guy's famous black truffle and artichoke soup. Everything was without flaw AND filled with passion.  All well and good, but the service was the best part. Guy Savoy has the most gracious staff ever. If I had asked "what is chicken?", they would have immediately described it with no hint of talking down to the guest. Everyone was immensely kind and helpful, while staying professional. They also were invisible when they should be invisible and somehow present when they should be present. Half empty butter holders disappeared and were replenished without any disturbance in our conversation. All together impressively seamless. Guy's son watches over the well trained staff and visits each table with warm and genuine care.  We were quite full after our three courses and decided to just have an espresso, passing on dessert. Our espresso was accompanied by three more gratis courses of sweets, including a cart of candies, pastries, ice creams, etc., then petit fours. This was the continuation of a pattern of several gratis mini-courses during the meal.  As we departed, we were presented a beautifully packaged box of house-made chocolates. The bill was huge, BUT it was worth every penny. The value was there. If a person is planning on seeing a show in Vegas and getting great seats, you would pay about as much. Why not try a world-class restaurant for a few hours. You'll be amazed.

Score: 2.5  I don't think Mario Batali would be happy with our experience. The setting is gorgeous: a faux Piazza San Marco that is always sunny, but not hot, and only one well behaved pigeon. The cafe, itself is charming with faux outdoor seating and a magnificent refrigerated tower for cheese and salumi. If only the food and service matched this santized version of Venice, we would be singing its praises.  The service is the poster child for LVSS (Las Vegas Service Syndrome -- "I will never see you again, so you are just an annoyance that must be dealt with" -- they do not rely upon regulars like most restaurants). The hostess exuded boredom as we approached her station. Our server was sluggish, coughed incessantly, was unfamiliar with the cheeses, and generally could care less. Being in the industry, we were appalled. We tried being extra nice, but no amount of warmth could encourage a glint of caring.  The food is pretty good. They use quality ingredients, but again, no one really cares or has passion for food. The pizza is OK, but not wood fired. The pasta (I had the bucatini) was good but nothing exciting. We ordered a portion of wine listed as 250ml which is about 8oz and it was not even close. This could be excusable if the prices were not so high.  I do not suggest this place. Mario Batali has some fine restaurants, but this is not one of them.

At the corner of St. Laurent and St. Viateur hang out. If Anthropologie had a coffeehouse, this would be it. Effortlessly shabby chic, including gilded chairs with springs hanging out the bottom, mix-n-match chairs and retro tables make a most endearing space. The eclectic crew makes some excellent espresso drinks and the menu leans towards healthy. The clientele caress and focus on their laptops while looking fab. No need for a sign or even business cards: Cajibi is a place I could while away the day.

The best bagel in the world: just maybe. Montreal style is very different from NY style and I prefer it. The Montreal style is about the same diameter, but has much less dough, so there is a large center hole. The dough is also a bit more dense but with larger holes and slightly sweeter. Because of the different geometry, it cooks differently with a high crust to interior ratio.  Fairmount is one amazing business. The place is unassuming. It is about the size of a house and when you enter (anytime, as the place is open 24/7), the place is stacked to the ceiling with bakery trays of bagged sesame bagels. The sesame bagel is by far their best selling item. As you approach the counter you can watch the whole process from hand rolling the dough to boiling, seeding, and baking.  Order a sesame bagel with cream cheese plus a bag of fresh ones to take home. Eat the bagel on the bench out front and be prepared to be amazed. It may very well be the best in the world.

In the luxurious Le St. James Hotel is a one stellar bar: the XO. First of all the room is the height of old-school luxury: columns, mouldings, height, drama, rich finishes. All of this is bathed in a combination of fixed incandescent light (subdued) and LED lighting that slowly cycles through jewel tones.  The bartenders are calm and expert. They are also most hospitable and kind with no aloofness from working in such a rarified atmosphere. Observing their technique makes the drinks taste even better. They make all of the classics plus some special St. James drinks. They will make any drink exactly to your specifications.  The bar food menu has some great items. The Montreal "Smoked Meat" Sandwich with fries is not to be missed. It may be the best pastrami sandwich ever. For dessert, consider the strawberry dessert, which features fresh Quebec strawberries, strawberry gel, strawberry paper, maple crumbles, hazelnut ice cream and stracciatella cream (wow!!).  For an after dinner drink, try "Neige" which is a local apple ice wine aged three years. It is an utterly complex nectar.  The XO Bar is not inexpensive, but if you order carefully, you can experience a bit of luxury without pretense for a reasonable tab.

This place reminds me of a Canadian version of a Gordon Biersch, but with worse food (if such a thing can be envisioned). The building and interior are great: Victorian industrial with massive riveted steel beans, dark wood, and superb design. You'd think it one of the finest brewpubs in Montreal until the corporate graphics and other chain-like signs begin to sink in.   The beer is brewed on premises in this local chain (supposedly there are some in Paris, too). It is good, but predictable: better than commercial beers but not the equal of the better independents. The food is de-tuned pub food done badly. There are many superior choices for food and for beer in the area.

The mother of all brew pubs. Not the biggest. Not the largest menu. Not the widest selection of beers from every land. Not the finest interior. It is simply the finest brewpub because it clearly is √ºberpassionate about beer, excels in the craft, offers the widest selection of unique brewed-on-premises beer I've ever seen, has not gotten commercial, is just the right size, and happens to have a narrow menu of well execute food. If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd be a regular (we loved chatting with the regulars).  The bar staff explains each beer in detail and offers tastes, although they also sell a sample size. Generally, there are 12 to 15 beers on tap, with one being on cask. They range from a blonde infused with hibiscus flowers to a wild yeast ale (heretique) aged 16 months and a stout made with chocolate and vanilla. Over a couple of days, we ended up trying each of them. What a range! Each was a revelation in the craft of brewing.  From the pub, you can see the 500L tanks where the beer is fermented and held for maturation. A sign indicates what is in each tank so that you can plan your return. Dieu du Ciel is a must stop for all people interested in beer while in Montreal.

My actual rating is 3.5 stars, I rounded up to give them the benefit of the doubt. It can be problematic to visit a place like Au Pied de Cochon that is so heavily hyped and known by foodies. How can any meal live up to the expectations? Our meal was solid with some delights and slight disappointments.  We booked four weeks out. Arriving on foot, we walked right by the place, as there is no sign (I like that).  We arrived at our appointed hour, but had to wait another half hour. For part of the wait, we were given a seat at the counter with a direct view of the controlled chaos of the open kitchen. The brigade was dressed in dark blue Dickies workshirts with name patches like one find at a garage. They were working feverishly. I noted the fry station seemed to be holding items longer than is best for freshness, something we would experience firsthand. While quaffing a local beer (St. Ambroise Pale Ale) we watched the different dishes coming out of the kitchen and started to formulate a plan.  Once at the table, we decided to order more items but split them. We ordered the famed poutine with foie gras, a tomato tart, fried zucchini blossoms (with the small zucchini attached), the PDC's melting pot. Half of the dishes were okay and half were excellent. The poutine was luke-warm, had just a few fries and the foie gras was not of the highest grade, having a fairly coarse texture. The blossoms were thickly battered, not the tempura batter that we had expected. They were also pretty greasy. The tomato tart was fresh and perfectly crafted: a good counterpoint to heavy food. The PDC's melting pot was the star with four kinds of pork plus roasted mushrooms and onions on a bed of mashed potatoes, which ended up being aligot: Auvergne style (cheese enriched) mashed potatoes all in a cocotte. Our favorite cut was the pork belly, but all were exemplary and we enjoyed the variety. Several tables had the pig's head for two, which I am sure was tasty, but my wife was not really up for the visuals for us to order it.  A table of four sat near us, which provided considerable humor. Two couples of asian gangstas talked up a storm of stupidity. The guys tried to impress the women who were preoccupied with playing video games on their phones. They ordered a bottle of wine which they promptly sent back stating it was "sour" (not big fans of acidity, I guess, which might have helped them enjoy their heavy meal). Behind them, a Japanese couple spent the entire time fiddling with their iPhones while eating: never talking with each other.  We ordered poached pear with vanilla ice cream and a cappuccino. The poached dessert was perfection, but the cappuccino was nasty. Super darkly roasted espresso, no steamed milk and a cap of fluffy dry foam.  In summary, it was a good meal with ups and downs. It was not the finest pork dish nor the best foie gras I have ever tasted, but it may have been an off night. To their great credit, the prices are shockingly reasonable. Given the crushing popularity, they could charge twice as much and still pack them in.

This is one of the busiest espresso bars I have ever experienced and for good reason. First of all, it is unabashedly Italian in every way - no chain or mixed messages here. It is emblazoned with Italian soccer flags and TVs are set on soccer. The staff is all Italian and they take pride in their work. With a line of 20 to 30 curling around the pool table (??), the barista calls out for advanced orders - be ready or get the evil eye! It's easy to order, they only serve classic Italian preparations: iced blended coffee drinks should look elsewhere. They crank it out fast and well on two 3-group FAEMA Non-Stops and serve it in the right drinkware. Go to the standup bar or sit at the small tables or go linger on the terrace. At Olimpico you get the best espresso drink in Montreal and a short trip to Italy all in one.

An excellent farmers market that is kind of open air in season and under cover for inclement weather. The core of produce stands is ringed by fixed locations of other prepared food and ingredients. These include several bakeries (Arabic, Polish, French), coffee roasters, spice stores, seafood shops, butchers, and the like. Allocate a good two or three hours to tour and nibble.

Suggested by several respected people, Frankie's is the real deal. It's a tiki bar that has old school polynesian decor, including internally lit puffer fish, and yet is not tired and gross. There are some carved coconut palm chairs (very upright) and benched alcoves along with  barstools. The space is pretty much the perfect size for a neighborhood bar and has a fascinating mix of patrons.  The drink list is classic tiki with some proprietary concoctions. As one would expect, the drinks descriptions are more humorous than a guide to what brand of liquor is actually used. We tried the Lava Leche, Thurston Howl, and Mai Tai. All were very respectable. For many of the drinks, one can either get the drink in a glass or in a specific tiki ceramic tumbler. They also have an on-line store for the drinkware and wearables.  Certainly worth a visit for those interested in tiki bars or just a fun setting to socialize.

Hotel Gault has a great location in Old Montreal (a five minute walk to the Square - Victoria Metro station). The building is elegant on the outside and contemporary/hip on the inside. The lobby is quite stark with a concrete floor and modern furniture. This contrasts with the warm and effusive staff members who are the antithesis of aloof hipsterness. They are full of local tips and genuinely show hospitality.  The rooms are contemporary/hip, as well. This means concrete flooring with some short carpet and a flooring that looks like a modern woven plastic placemat, modern furniture, a futon style bed, and no cabinetry (wheeled shelving units). It can be a bit  too clever: poor lighting, bathroom ergonomics that are troublesome, and a generally messy look. Housekeeping keeps the room clean, but is a bit lax on some details like glassware and tidying the place up.  Breakfast is served in the lobby. Included in our room rate was a continental breakfast. Even though the place was generally empty, the service was excruciating slow, given that no cooking was required. We would have complained were it not for the delightful servers who always displayed a bit of quirky Franglish humor. The breakfast, itself was just fine.  The room rates are pretty high, Montreal is not an inexpensive city. Stay there if you are looking for a design-oriented place and are willing to overlook some inconveniences. The staff will charm you.

Dean and Heidi are fantastic restauranteurs. Dean has well honed palate for flavor combinations and is never satisfied with the status-quo.   He has elevated the humble pasty (comfort food for coal miners) into collection of international meals enclosed in pastry. I have eaten 90% of the pasty menu and every single pasty was well crafted and bursting with flavor. My favorites are: Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Tikka, Lovely Bit 'O Salmon, and Bangers+Mash. Always ask for double sauce!  There is a fine line-up of beer on tap, including hard to find ones like Dogfishhead 90 Min IPA. I usually do Guinness or a Black+Tan, all poured properly.  It's fun to watch staff make the pasties. They are a tattooed, funky bunch -- you will never find a more gracious group or more dedicated to getting the product right, though.  I enjoy the Mesa location with family, but prefer the grittier "coal mine-like" atmosphere of the original Tempe location if I'm alone or with the guys.

This is the best cheese shop in the valley, in my opinion. While Whole Foods probably has a wider selection, no one has a BETTER selection and passion+knowledge of cheese.  The place is in a portion of what appears to be an old Circle K store. In that incarnation, there was certainly an emphasis on domestic cheeses such as Kraft singles, Cheez-Whiz and the like. I am happy to say that Petit Fromage proudly carries on that tradition, but with artisanal domestic cheeses. Certainly there are fine imported cheeses offered, but the domestics are clearly a passion of the owner, Lara.  Domestics have come a long way! Clearly, some of the best cheeses in the world now are from the US. Don't think so? Have Lara sample some "Barely Buzzed" Cheddar from Beehive Cheese Co (UT) or the great cheeses from Bittersweet Plantation (LA) or the amazing ColoRouge from MouCo (CO). You will be blown away.  The great thing about Petite Fromage, other than great cheese, is an infectious passion for the cheese and for helping the customer learn more. They sample generously and offer charcuterie and appropriate companion products with cheese. Their cheese plates are wonderful and they are always ready to make a recommendation for cheeses to take home. I just wished that I loved closer!

This my favorite coffeehouse in Phoenix. It combines excellent coffee, coffee culture, a great space, and good service.  Daniel Wayne is no stranger to the coffee business. He has worked in Phoenix, studied in Italy, started a coffee business in Seattle and two in Phoenix. I really think he is has a superb palate, respect for tradition while not shunning the modern, and a great eye for style. He is also very humble and gracious. His roasting style shows evidence of having spent time in Italy: not afraid of caramelization and a clear focus on balance + complexity. Daniel is a fine barista and I always ask him to make my drink, if he is at the store.  Coffee culture is definitely apparent. From the espresso machine to the roaster seen clearly through a window in the seating area, it is a place serious about coffee without being overbearing.  The space is outstanding. First of all it is "real place". It was an old market, I think and has perfect light, due to its orientation, windows, and high ceiling. Daniel pulls together an eclectic assemblage of vintage chairs, drafting tables, a glass door for a menu, and an old school console stereo w giant dorm speakers. The elements work together to make a relaxing urban space. Daniel plays vinyl and we both are huge Cat Stevens fans. He played the "Tea for the Tillerman" album for me on my last visit, which made my day.  Not sure why they get slammed for service. I have always been treated well by all of the staff. They may not have the "may I take your order, please" smiley service attitude, but are respectful and kind. It is a great place to hang out for hours or just get well crafted espresso drink and a pastry.

My wife and I love Funktional Fitness! Jeremy and Luis have put together an amazing team that really puts the well being of the clients first. Their basic approach is functional fitness, meaning the sort of fitness you need in everyday life NOT to win some weightlifting competition. Their training involves relatively simple exercises that require very little in specialized (expensive) equipment. Unlike many places, they also focus on flexibility and on diet.  The team does a very good job of encouraging people to progress and has many success stories to prove it. We actually have fun while they work us hard. The place is clean and the size that makes you feel special, rather than a part of the herd. They also never twist your arm to sign contracts and shame you into spending money like most places.  If you are looking for a place that will help you get fit and stay fit, you would do well to visit Funktional Fitness,

The Vesper Bar is basically the lobby bar for the Cosmopolitan. It has a cool vibe and is very well located for people watching / making comments as the endless parade of people walk by. As one would expect at the Cosmo, it is aimed at the hipsters and those thinking themselves "in the know". Even so, the service is good and they make solid drinks. This is the best bar in the Cosmo if you are looking for a "mixology" experience.  We really like the menu. It is set up in two columns. On the left are classics made in the traditional recipe with quality ingredients. On the right side is the Vesper twist on the classic that is of a similar flavor profile, but with greater complexity or a thought provoking ingredient swap. For instance, one can order a classic Manhattan or the twist: "The Mulberry". The variation was in every way better than a Manhattan -- deeper, more complex, and a long finish. We tried several of their variations on a classic and thought they did an excellent job.

Actual rating is 4.5 stars, which is very impressive for a restaurant that has been open just one week.  One thing to appreciate about the Mastros team is that they know what they do well and do not greatly depart from it. They really have the steakhouse formula down to a science and so Steak 44 is just the logical extension of what they have historically excelled at. The core of the menu is expertly cooked steaks and seafood, ala carte traditional sides (with some twists), raw bar, cocktails and good selection of wine.  I had heard that Steak 44 was intended to be a more casual and less expensive concept than some previous ventures. It doesn't seem to me that it is really less expensive, but it is a bit more casual. The interior of the place is drop dead amazing. It one of the best look restaurants in the state and is sort of compartmentalized, which helps with noise and privacy while still keeping you in the action. Our favorite "compartments" are the booths that have a glass wall shared by the kitchen. That is a very risky thing for a restaurant to do, but it really lets you be in the furious action of the kitchen, while shielded from noise and heat.  As for the menu, the Mastro folks have decide to offer some smaller choices, which has been a "complaint" at other venues (all you really need to do is split things, though). There are smaller steaks and larger steaks. The salads, sides and desserts are now individual size versus shareable, which allows for a lighter meal or the ability to try more items.  The great: deep fried deviled eggs, raw bar, perfectly cooked steaks, halibut, brussel sprouts, tempura asparagus, cocktails, sorbets. The halibut was probably the tastiest and most skillfully cooked halibut i've had in a long time.  Could use work: the bread course (bread balls browned in a cast iron skillet with herbed butter) - messy and not that good, steakhouse stuffing (seems like the same bread balls reformatted) - unexciting and lacking in texture.  The service was excellent, balancing cordiality with professionalism, which is a tough balance to hit. Our waiter, AJ, was very knowledgeable and paced the meal appropriately.  I am very impressed with this new undertaking by the Mastros team, particularly with how well executed it is right from the start.

We finally had the opportunity to try this micro-restaurant in the Desoto. It was a Sunday night, so the place was fairly quiet. Walking up to the counter, we were intrigued by the menu. The chef was super friendly and explained each item in detail. Since we were with others, we ordered practically the entire menu, which, while small, is ambitious for the tiny space. We decide to go get cocktails at the main bar and by the time they were completed, nearly all of the food was ready. It is served in paper boats and cups and we headed upstairs to partake.  Every item was delicious. I particularly enjoyed their take on cauliflower which was twist on Buffalo chicken wings, but so much better. The fried cauliflower had blue cheese, a hot sauce and celery leaves. Much better than any wings I've ever had. The shaved catfish was pretty amazing, too. By cutting thin slices of catfish and then breading and frying them, the ratio of textures was considerably better than the traditional fried catfish filet. The pickled cabbage slaw was nice and tart to cut the richness. A couple of dishes featured traditional golden rice from the South and we loved how some of the rice was intentionally allowed to crust on the pan and char a bit. This resulted in textural interest and some smokey and charred notes.  Even though Stephen Jones, himself, was not in the kitchen, his fellow chefs executed everything well. The ingredients were true to Southern cuisine and the dishes were prepared in a way that respected the traditions while innovating. Nice work!
