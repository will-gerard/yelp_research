Holy shit! I think I tried all their flavors. Nothing horrible to be found.  I know the predicament; You want something cold and sweet, but the stank-ass smell of Baskin Robbins could ruin an other wise great life.  Well Angel Sweet really delivers a product that is visually appealing and tasty at the same time.  There are no gigantic tubs of god-knows-what in a iced up nasty freezer here. Only Fancy Smansy tastyness.   The nice lady asked us what we had anything fun planned for today and all I could think was "Your goddamn right I do! I am going to eat the living crap out of this stuff and not regret it a bit.".  So I did and I don't.

GELATO UPDATE!    (Read in Captain Kirk voice please)  Captain's Log Stardate 92308 I had just finished another grueling away mission on Planet Therapee 08.  The only life form encountered was a woman named Councellar, who asks a lot of questions and seems to be adept at circular logic. She was not blue, so I did not make out with her and besides, that would violate the prime directive. Spock acted illogical even though he can't.  Bones said that he wasn't something and I made Scotty do a complex engineering job in less time then he said he needed.  During the Shuttle ride home, I  veered from my plotted course and visited the pleasure planet Angel Sweet in the Gelato Nebula.  A fine distraction after such a mind numbing session...errr, I mean mission. Why all the questions? Why the poor artwork?  Why is there a dead tree in her office?   Hmm...  Upon docking at Planet Angel Sweet, the away team (me) was greeted by one of the inhabitants. A ditsy young thing that clearly has no clue about anything other than Hannah Montana, a local preslut from a nearby Planet Horseshit.  I believe The Universal Translator was on the fritz, because I could have swore she said "I would rather shave than wash" and "What!? We have a website? I did not know that."  Clearly  a linguist will need to be sent to this planet.  The Angel Sweet planet offers up many distracting delectable treats to take  the weary space traveler's mind off of his mind.  What to choose, which flavors should I mix?  Should I mix Cream and fruit or chocolate and peanut butter?  Where is Zulu when I need to plot a course? Only one thing to do. Taste all of them and then make a hasty choice.  Just say the first thing that spills out of your mouth.  (Keep reading in the Kirk Voice!)   "I'll.......have.........The Panna Cotta.......and Buttter......Finger.  A wise choice.   The Carmel in the Panna Cotta mixed well with the Terran delicacy of fingers dipped in butter.  I was even rewarded with another stamp on my  official Angel Sweet card. 4 more visits and I will receive a free kids cone. Take that Kahn!    This place is so good, it should be as illegal as Romulan Ale.

You walk in, and it smells just like Lee-Lee Market. There is outdated furniture and decor.  There is a constant Din of Vietnamese being spoken in the back and front of house. The menu is covered in things that you cannot pronounce and quite frankly have no idea what they are.  There is something called "Squid Sauce" on the table.  This place has got to kick some serious ass right? NO! No. It does not have to.   Enough already. Just Stop it.  Just because some place has a weird vibe and seams out of this world does not mean that it is amazing or even good. It means that you should give it a fair shake just like everything else.  When you look past the glamor of being unglamorous you soon realize that this place is mediocre at best.  I had the Chicken in Lemon Grass sauce and you know what? It was edible.  And I ate it.   I also had the Thai Iced tea and I drank it as well. But that was it. Nothing more and nothing less.  I  know when something tastes good and I refuse to chalk this one up to being an unsophisticated dolt (In reality, I am am exactly that, but my tongue and tummy do not know me very well. So let's keep this between us).  I have done it a thousand times before.  "Well, this place is really foreign and weird, so let's go there and be hip!" Well today I draw a line in the sand and make a stand.    Here is the beginning of my food manifesto! 1.Good food is universal. If something does not taste good, it does not taste good.   And...Hmm...Well... That got off to a good start and then lost steam after my first demand.  Well, Ted Kaczynski I am not.

DIM SUM suckas! DIM SUM.  Dim Sum is the greatest thing to hit food since teeth.  I have been holding off on writing this Yelp for months now.  I just could not figure out a way to wrap my head around the awesomeness that is Dim Sum.  I have been eating here pretty much every weekend since I was first introduced to it by fellow Yelpers Jenn H. and  Scott S.  Joe Crack played a role in the introduction as well.  Joe Crack is not a Yelper (He should be though.) but he is a wizard.  So you should be willing to take the suggestion of someone so wise in the ways of the world. He also coined the phrase "No Goddamn BBQ pork bun!" Which turns out to be a useful phrase when having Dim Sum, cause they try to shove that down your throat from every cart that comes strolling by.  The absolute greatest thing about Dim Sum is the ability to be eating awesome food within seconds of sitting down.  From the moment you sit down they are coming by with carts of amazing, trying to get you to try everything from BBQ pork bun to Chicken feet.  You could, if you were so inclined, be in and out of the place in 15 minutes and have a belly full of really tasty Chinese food bits.   Some of my favorite things are: The Chinese Broccoli The Spring rolls The Curry meat Triangles The pot stickers And...  My absolute favorite is the Sticky rice. If you go to Dim Sum you have to get the sticky rice.  It is a ball of rice wrapped in a lotus leaf.  Then Jesus and Buddha get together and cry tears of joy over the amazing creation. Then Luke Skywalker and Captain Kirk bless it with a light saber and Tricorder. Then Kurt Cobain plays a misunderstood song over it. Then right before it gets to your table the entire restaurant does a rendition of "Be our Guest" from Beauty and the Beast as Pamela Anderson and Jenna Jameson deliver it while talking in tongues.   It is that good people.

So here is the deal with Chipotle.  Every once in a while I forget why I don't like coming here and then *poof*. I magically find myself in line, looking at that damned Aztec art thingy, wondering what a plywood and sheet metal Montezuma has to do with the comically overstuffed burrito I am doomed to regret eating.   The food does not taste horrible.  It is decent.  I really enjoy their fountain soda, I don't know why.  Their are a few places that just have amazing fountain soda.  QT for one and Chipotle for two.  (That reminds me, I am going to yelp QT next.  I have some shit to say about those Mo-Fo's.)  So here is why Chipotle gets two stars. Every time I eat there, I get about halfway through my giant tube filled with meat, beans, and rice when Ol' buzz kill Chipotle shows up in my gut, like the cops coming to a party.  Chipotle barges in and yells "Chipotles here, everybody OUT!".  That is when all of the drunken teenagers inside me make haste for the nearest exit.   Yes, I did just make a diarrhea euphemism, relating Chipotle to the cops and my poop to drunken teenagers.  I am not proud.  Why do I repeatedly torture myself for mediocre food?  Although, I do expect mad props for not going with a Montezuma's Revenge joke.

I will tell you exactly why this place is so great.  This place will blow your mind.  Not only is the service good, but the food is amazing.    Here is the rub, your friends are drunk and they start babbling on about wanting to go to some Mexican food restaurant that inevitably ends in the letters ____berto's.  It does not matter which, they all are basically the same.  You go and get your gut injected with evil and then are forced to deal with that for 10-12 hours. Talk about regret. Don't do it.  Like a child of abuse, you have the power to stop the cycle.  Say "Nah" Like the famous sunglasses kid, "Let's go to Mi Patio and have some fantastic food, amazing service, and keep drinking to boot."  You will be a hero. You will make Ironman look like AquaMan (He's a Chump.  "You sir, command that fish into this taco.").   Short list of amazing things to be had here: 1. Margaritas. 2. Mi Patio Taco. Not a taco and not a burrito. What is it? 3. The Chips and Salsa  4. Chicken Tacos.   5.  Ice Tea.  6. Pacifico

El sol bakery is one of those places that everyone says "You have to go there" or "OMG....it is so good."  So over the past 5 years I have gone there 3 times.  Each time swearing that I would not go back for any reason, then like every victim of abuse I find myself going back to the same place that has hurt me so many times before, thinking "This time will be different."  and "Maybe it was my fault, if only I was a better customer.".   The food here is good.  I have always liked the food, once I have gotten it.  But there in lies the problem with El Sol Bakery. Every time I have gone in to place an order for take out, it has taken over 1/2 hour for them to get the food to me.  Have you ever had to sit there and look like a dope waiting for your take out order?  Well if you haven't, let me give you brief snipet/summary of the conversation that played out in my head, wit my self.  10 minutes after ordering: Man...this is taking a while.... Can't rush good food... heh... Hmmm... lets look at my phone.  15 minutes after: Boring... Hey! how in the fuck did that guy get his food, he just walked in. I am so hungry. Really?  That lady came in like a full ten minutes after me....This is horse shit. I did order didnt ?  20 minutes: Am I losing my mind?  Did they forget about me? Should I be a dick and say something?  25 minutes: Berrber grrrrmmmdrib! Really? What the Fuck? She knows I am here, she just looked at me. Thats it. I need to say something.  30 minutes: GOD MOTHER FUCKING DAMMIT!!! I AM LOSING MY MIND! All I wanted was a Burrito. That is it. A simple little burrito. I did order didnt I? Did I already say that? Hmm...what was the answer? Well did I? I have been here all morning.  It is going to start looking like I like to hang out here. That is it. I am going to burn this dump to the ground.  That'll teach em.  I am not even hungry any more.  And then sometime beyond 35 minutes, she brings over my order and I like the dope that I am just smile and say "Thank you" and walk out.  Why do I take such a beating over a stupid food item?  Why don't I ever say something?  Why do I go back knowing that these people are going to systemically push me over the edge?  Why does it take over a half hour to make a burrito?  Really it is not worth it.

I love this place.    I have had only a couple poor experiences with food here. One was a veggie burrito, What the hell was I thinking?  It blew.  Everything else I have had here has been amazing.  My personal favorite is the Chicken Quesadilla it is a taste de force.  The tacos are all the bomb diggity.  They are exactly like street tacos you would get in Mexico or from a taco stand on the streets in Phoenix.  Another good thing about this place, unlike other taco stand type places I have patronized, this one has never turned my GI tract into a Wal-Mart the day after thanksgiving. You know, lot's of traffic and little to show for it when the day is done.  Another Yelper said that a "good looking family" owns Mi Casita.  I will translate this for you.  He really meant to say "The family that owns this place has a  smoking hot daughter."  I have stared into her eyes many time trying to remember what in the world I came in for.  She has eyes like the lady in the famous National Geographic cover photo.  Go to this place.  Mmm.... I am starving.

Bangarang!  Not only does Lollicup serve boba, tea and other assorted Asian drinks. But they also have a wide assortment of inexpensive food.    When you walk into a this place you realize that it must be authentic.  It is always full of real live Asian people who are having the time of their lives.  It is like walking into an Italian restaurant and seeing the entire cast of the Sopranos.  Sure you might be a little scared at first but in your heart you know that you are in for a treat/adventure, or a treatventure according to the word I just made up.  I got the Thai Iced tea and The Steam Pork buns.  I have only had better Thai iced tea at the Thai Hut in Phoenix, but in all fairness that was after a night long bender in which one of my friends may have gained carnal knowledge of a melon. So it really is not fair to compare seeing as how my mind was already blown that day. The Steamed Pork Buns were amazing. They do take a little while longer to make than normal. But when you cram that much awesome into a little bun thing it is best not to rush.  They also have an assortment of games that you can play while waiting or eating.  More places need to have games available. You here me Rose and Crown?  I want to play games!  There is a Bigfoot like rumor about free Wi-Fi here as well.  This has yet to be tested.  I will assemble a crack team of battleship playing nerds to asses this claim as soon as possible.  Stay Tuned.

Whatever you do, DO NOT under any circumstances try BOBA TEA.  You will instantly become addicted and then end up craving it like a pregnant lady craves mud and pickles.  Pregnant ladies are weird.   For the uninitiated,  Boba Tea is various types of teas, slushes or milk drinks that you can have them put these little tapioca balls into.  They are about the size of a pea and they taste kinda sweet and are chewy.  They serve two purposes as far as I can tell.  To shoot up your straw at light speed and cause you to foolishly choke in front of your hot lady date or to turn the boring ho-hum activity of drinking into a fun filled game of hide and go seek with your straw.   Now I usually get one of two drinks, the Black Honey Tea with boba or the Ginger Milk drink with boba as well.  Both are awesome in their own respect.  The Black tea is very light and thirst quenching and the Ginger Milk is creamy, sweet with the throat burning effects only ginger can give.   My only complaint, and this is solely directed at my own inability to jam that straw through the top of the cup.  I am instantly transported back to the days of youth soccer wherein I was the only kid too stupid to jam that straw through the top of a caprisun.  At least this time I don't share my shame with a bunch of jocks but instead get snickered at by the Asians as I jam that silly large straw through the top and splash tea all over my school clothes.

Meat Meat Meat Meat Meat Meat Meat Meat Meat Meat Meat Meat............MEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAT!!!!!!!    Guess who got a new grill/smoker and has been smoking the living crap out of every piece of meat he comes across..... No not the Dalai Lama... Why would you even think that? Weirdo.  ME! I did. That's who, ME!!    So I stopped by the old Von Hanson's butcher shop to check out the selection.  It is a great little shop.  It reminds me of a butcher shop that would be in Back to the Future. The butchers are wearing all white and  are very patient and knowledgeable about meat.  As far as I can tell they come in pairs like the Sith do, there was the master and an apprentice. The master was an older man who is very kind and well spoken and the apprentice has a mustache like Wesley from the Princess bride.   I ended up getting two racks of ribs for the price of one.  It was a sweet Yelp deal that I was happy to take advantage of.  I also got a sheet of beef jerky about the size and shape of Rocky's head from Mask.  They have probably the best beef jerky that I have ever tasted.  Even if you're just stopping in for a gander, you have to get a piece of jerky. It is worth the drive.  I think I got three movie references into this review.  Not a record by any stretch, but worthy of a mention.

Well, well well.  If it isn't Thai Hut. So, Thai Hut, you're feeling your oats.  Maybe your starting to make some money? Getting those bills paid? Your ends are meeting pretty well these days?  I noticed you don't need homeless sign twirlers any more. Nice. Where did they go?  Well since things are going well, you should start shitting on the very people that you rely on, your customers.  Sorry folks. When Yelpers hang out together you get multiple reviews of the same experience.  Here is my version, albeit filtered through my own version of life called Mark-O-Vision.   So, Jenn H. and I are kicking it old school.  You know collars popped, pants pegged,  and my Cubbies hat cocked all sideways and shit.  Like 90210 meets Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo.    At first we were going to go to IHOP to get our french toast on.  We pulled up to IHOP and noticed that the recent tornado that had ripped through Phoenix had rendered any and all hopes of getting an internationally inspired breakfast meal moot.  Will nobody come to Phoenix's aid and help these poor desert dwellers out?  "George Bush hates pancakes!"  So we decided on the next best thing open a little after 9pm at night, Thai Hut.  When we pulled up we were even a little worried that we were to late, but the sign said 10pm.  Score! (Ah, how cute.  Jenn and I wrote the same thing about how late they are open. Score indeed.)  So we sit and order drinks.  I wanted water and an Ice Tea.  What I got was a water and a Thai Ice Tea.  Nice up-sale!  Oh well, it comes with a cute little straw hat thingy so I spend the next few minutes turning it into a little snake and forgot the mishap.  Then we are told that we have ten minutes to place our order.  What? What? Why? The sign says.... For a full and mostly accurate transcription on the dialogue see Jenn H's review. I think she left out a lot of the "Boiy'z", "Dooodes", "Bro-dawgs", "For Shiz's",  and Samuel Jackson quotes that we constantly pepper our conversions with.  But, you can just add any one of the aforementioned on to any of the lines of dialogue she used to get a really accurate feel for the conversion. For example: Us: "But we thought you are open till 10PM, Bro-Dawg?"  So to make a short story longer.  We were either forced to order right then and there even though we still had at least thirty minutes left until the posted closing time or leave.   So we left.  WE felt completely rushed and unappreciated.  Why would someone turn away business?  I could understand if we showed up late or even if we had Andy Dick with us.  But just throwing us out because you all wanted to get home a little early and, I don't know, play Jenga makes no sense.  It wasn't like the place was empty either.  There was a dude that looked just like Jason Mewes at the very next table yucking it up with his head banging wife/woman.  When we told the lady that we were leaving she looked at us and said "No, problem."  Not in a cute Jamaican t-shirt kind of way, but in a snarky "oh, thank god" kind of way.  Doodes! That is horseshit.  Why even post your hours if you are not going to at least pretend to keep those hours? I even had to pay for the Thai Iced Tea I did not order.  It is going to take a head wound induced bought of amnesia in order to get me to come back to this place.

Ah, The Rose and Crown.  A group of my friends and I have claimed this spot as one of our regular digs.  Much like a pack of wild dogs that have pissed on every corner of thier territory, this one is ours. You can come too though. We are not mean dogs, just a band of roving comedians with self-esteem issues and an inhuman ability to drink.  Well let me just say a few things about the Rose and Crown. -They have never kicked us out. -They have a pile of beer. -They make a mean Mind Eraser. -I left my debit card there and they did not abuse it. -The Cheese plate is amazing. There is way too much feta to not throw it at people.  One poor soul even suffered the indignity of a Cheesey Sanchez. -One sweet patio.  You can stare across the way at the smug Pizza Bianco patrons.  You really need to check this place out.  the owners are awesome.  They have trivia on Wednesday nights.  And you for sure can have a ton of fun.

I first drove by Aromas at the Islands and I thought "What in the world is that place?"  Could it be some type of Aroma Therapy joint? A Head shop? And those were the only two questions that rattled around in my head before I moved on to the next shiny object.   Then one day I was shaking the living crap out of the UrbanSpoon Application for my Iphone and it came up again.  This time I was told that it was an Indian/Pakistani restaurant.  Hmm... Now I am intrigued.     The next day I am there.   When I walked I saw, a very small place that can seat about twenty or so. It has some very basic decor and some mirrors on the wall.  The tables are covered in a lacey plastic tablecloth that is in turn covered in glass.    This all screams local restaurant and I am already falling in love.  I have a seat at a table and begin to realize that I have no clue about anything relating to Indian food.  Sure, I recognize the word curry but that is it.  The nice waitress puts up with my questions and did not make me not feel like an idiot.  I ordered and I tried to remember the names, but I couldn't. So I will describe them to the best of my ability.  One item looked like and giant Slim-Jim and the other looked like bunch of red stuff.   My descriptive ability sucks. They also brought out what looked like shiny wagon wheels with red dust on them.  These things were awesome.  They tasted like toast with egg-yolk on it. I almost ate them all.  When the dinner arrived, the chef came out and said "hi".  He brought with him some Yogurt Chutney (Ha. I remembered something's name!)  This stuff tasted just like lotion.  So I did not eat anymore of that.  Everything else was amazing!  I fell in love with Indian food and the flat bread Naan (Double HA!  I remembered two things.).  I went back two days later for the lunch buffet.  The same Chef came out to greet me and he instantly remembered me. That is awesome. (Granted, I was wearing the same clown outfit with horns as the first time, but he still remembered me.)  You can really tell when a place cares about their customers and their business. Aroma's wants you to come back and they want to make your experience at their restaurant one worth repeating.  Neat.

Alert... Alert.... Alert.... Boowee...Boowee...Booweee. Something has happened! Something has happened!  I have never seen any place take a dive this fast and this is coming from a man has seen The Hunt for Red October a million-zillion times.  So I was cooling out, maxin and relaxin and I thought "I am going to go and get my Aroma's on".   I rolled up, check my shades and entered the establishment. The sweet and mousy waitress from my first few visits was there and I knew something was up from the moment that I walked in.  She had the thousand yard stare, she looked right through me.  Since my last visit she must have seen things that would ruin even the most hardened of people.  McCain, that pussy, he ain't got shit on this girl. She knows pain. What could have happened?  She took my order and charged my card.  Then I waited, and I waited some more. Then just when I thought that I was done waiting, I waited some more. It took a full thirty minutes to get my takeout order.  I would have said something. But what do you say to someone who is clearly on the edge?  My food finally comes. I leave. I get home. I put on the Daily Show. I open the container.   My chicken curry contains exactly 3 pieces of chicken.    Monkey Balls!  What?  It took them 30 minutes to cook 3 chicken nuggets in a Curry Sauce?   Dive! Dive! Dive!  Then I ate the little tiny pieces of meat. I realized then that they were mostly bone and not a big bone that you could actually separate the meat from.  It almost seemed as if they actually cracked chicken bones up into splinters and then jammed them into the meat.  It was like an Indian version of the ol' razor in the apple trick. I took a bite and chewed and right before I swallowed I felt the knife like bone get stuck in my throat. I panicked, "Oh no! Chicken bones are bad for dogs, Therefore, they must be horrible for humans!" I start to really panic. I cough, I drink, I swallow,  and I jam my fingers down my throat.  This is how I am going to die, watching The Daily Show and choking to death on a chicken bone.  I soon regained my composure and got over the chicken bone. I managed to choke it down, literaly.  It  is currently making its way through my digestive system, and I  hope no update will follow.    Just then the sweats hit me.  This food hit my gut and made it feel like a bunch of hippies had eaten the brown acid and then were dancing around in my stomach and on top of my soul.   I truly felt horrible. I curled up in bed and attempted to sleep on the evil that had invade my body.  The good news is that I lived to write this review.  The bad news is that there is a rogue chicken bone lose inside my body.  Aroma's what happened? You used to be so good.  You used to make me happy on the inside.  I fear you are in your death throws.  I wonder what little restaurant you will become next.

Here is an amazing example of Yelp at its best.  The renters in a house I own go MIA over night.  They leave me no notice and with a dirty house that I need to clean, rent, and repair in a few days.  Yelp provided me with the number to George at Paridise Carpet Cleaning and well......  Begin Montage sequence (Sung to pokemon theme).....  I'm gonna clean this house real fast.   I'm gonna fix all it faults and cracks The walls need painting  And the yard's full of poo... The carpet is filthy what to do? Clean it quick! Gotta Clean it all!! ..... When "Ex-Tentant" used "Abandon House" and it was highly effective.  I countered with my level 99 Georgio and used "Paridise Clean" and "Ex-tenant" fainted.  Gotta Catch them all!

All right...  So I go to an "Irish" bar/pub for one reason and one reason only.  To have irish whiskey.  So when I went to Murphy's Law I expected to have some irish whiskey, it is an Irish pub after all.  So when I ask what types of irish they have I get the answer "Bushmills and Jameson"  Just regular old Bushmills and Jameson.  Not even the top shelves of each brand, just the boring old shopping at Walgreens brands of irish whiskey.    So I have a new "Irish" bar that I hang out at.  It has a way better and deeper selection of Irish whiskey.  It's called Fry's Grocery store.  I'll be getting my Irish on in the frozen food section.

Sometimes I want scream and yell, "Don't you know who I am? I'm Mark Jordan and you don't know who you're messing with!"  But then I realize that the puzzling look I would get wouldn't change anything and they would most likely just laugh about me later.  So I just grumble to myself and write a strongly worded yelp.   So I'm moving and I enlist the help of my closest friends.  I promise to have cold beer in the afternoon and hot coffee in the morning.  For the coffee I decide to go against my natural instinct of the giant jug of starbucks and go for Dunkin Donuts Box of Joe.    I get up early, call and order a dozen donuts, a Box O Joe and  1/2 dozen bagels.   I asked the nice gentleman on the other end of the line if the coffee came with cups, creamer and sugar.  BECAUSE I AM MOVING AND WILL HAVE PACKED AWAY MY COFFEE CUPS!!! "Yes." He answered and gave me the total.    I show up at the Dunkin Donuts at the prescribed time to get my unhealthy feast for my famished,  hungover, ragamuffin band of aged movers.  I get home and unload the bounty.  And what do you get when you take the F out of cups? THERE IS NO F IN CUPS!! So I guess it is okay for a bunch of grown men and women to pass around a jug of piping hot coffee and get the rim of the opening greasy from their donut slimed lips. It's a good thing that all of my friends and I exchanged cooties a long time ago when we became Eskimo brothers.    ......i'm mark Jordan and I'm gonna write a yelp about this.......oh never mind.

Going to flame burger has been like becoming a father for first time.    I got to watch it grow inside the hulk of a defunct El Pollo Loco, first with minor remodeling and a new layer of paint.  "I wonder what it will be.... A filiberto's?  Another  (fill in the blank)bertos?"  Soon I would see life stirring inside of it.    "Oh look Chairs... could it be a Chinese restaurant? Guess we will have to wait and see."  Then the first signs...  "A FLAME BURGER!!!! IT'S GOING TO BE A FLAME BURGER!!!!!  Wait, what's Flame Burger?"  Then the news...  Friend: " its time....Flamer burger is here... It's finally open"  Me: "Ok....What...... What?.....Its time?  Its here? .............Ill get the bag."  I was so excited.  I was going to eat at Flameburger!! After watching grow and show its first signs of life, it was finally here.   I got to see it open its doors for the first time.  I got to see it take its first customers. I got to see it have its first issues as a restaurant.  I got to see it make its first friends. I got to see it have it first issues with people not liking it.    This might just be a proud father talking, but Flameburger has turned into a quite a respectable little burger joint.  They make a good burger and they have their own special twist on a sauce. They also may be a burger joint, but they have a great Chicago style hot dog as well.  The best I have had since my many drunken trips to Wiener Circle in Chicago. (On a side note: If you ever feel like a fast and smart white person Weiner Circle will swiftly and brutally beat that thought right out of your head.)  Today I feel like flameburger has finally become a man.  For an extra effect go and play Cats in the Cradle by Harry Chaplin and have a good cry. You will feel better afterwards.)
