Wow..this place is awesome. I was blown away by the staff and nice and fun they were. When we went it was raining and we couldn't go on the gravity ropes or zip line. They were quick to make sure our experience wasn't a bad one. We will for be coming back a couple times a year. All day riding rides for $25 bucks. Way better the pop up carnivals and way cheaper!!!

Had the gollo burro...it was amazing. Take the chance a go in. The place looks run down, but you won't regret going in and trying. I will definitely be back and it is going to be hard to try something else after having that burrito.

WOW I don't know where to start regarding my dislike for this dealership. I know this is a buisness to make money, but i have never been treat like a paycheck for someone. They cared nothing about me or what i kind of car i wanted just something to get me into so they could a car sold. i first went to them in February to get a new camaro, they wrote up an agreement, i left with a car and they called me back 2 days later telling me to bring the car back or $5000 dollars because i didn't get approved per the agreement. i said no to the money any brought the car back. the sale manager told me that we could only get you approved for 'X' amount. Told me to come out to the Tent Event in April and they could be more agressive on my trade in and a better deal on the new car so make the deal work. i brought my old sale write from february and told them the story again because the saleman i was working with wasn't available. i said that i needed to be $5000 less than less contract in order to make things work per the last approval, salesman said ok. they came back with an OK and payments that i liked. Seemed smooth 4 hours later waiting for fianance, I looked at the write up and saw'll that they didn't do that. finance guy said that it was probably not going to be approved, but lets send it anyway. i just wanted to go home. Now they couldn't issue me a temp tag because i guess someone tried to buy this car before and deal didn't go through and no one canceled the old tag out. So i get to go home without a car that i signed for. Sales manager said "is there a car out there you can live with so we can get you to drive a car home tonight". Really? No one contacted me for 6 days until i called them asking the status on the car. they said they couldn't get me financed again. i was approved for 'X' not what the submitted. I told them that up front and they couldn't careless they sold enough cars that weekend to car amout me. Worst customer service ever!!! i will tell as many people i can to shop else where, Chapman Chevrolet is the worst.

What a joke company! Has to be the worst experience ever. I reserved a midsize car and wanted to pick it up on our way out to San Diego. It was 12:30am and when I showed up to pickup my car that was reserved they said that they had no mid-sized cars available, and that all they had was a Nissan exterra or a dodge journey which were $20 more a night. He said he would do me a favor and only charge $10 a night. After I explained that it should be a free upgrade due to the fact it was their fault. He said he can cancel the reservation and go somewhere else. How convenient at 12:30am when everyone is closed. So after forced to agree to the upgrade I went down stairs to get the car and noticed they had lots of midsized cars. I said something, but was told that the sales office was closed and would have to talk to a manger in the morning. Don't risk trying to save a couple bucks with this company the are the worst!!!!! When I got back from the trip I tried to get a hold of manger or supervisor who are located offsite away from the public,but they avoid any conversation or confrontation. 3 weeks later no contact and I give up. I will tell everyone I see that. I hope you do the world a favor and go under.
