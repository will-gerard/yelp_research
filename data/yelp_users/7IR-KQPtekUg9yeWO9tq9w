Eh, Alfredo is better at Olive Garden and spaghetti was bland BUT calamari and stuffed mushrooms are amazing! Love they take you to your seat through the kitchen. I'd recommend appetizers and Italian soda :) servers are great, friendly atmosphere

Best beans and rice I have ever had, and believe me I am picky about beans and rice.  Especially the beans, it is hard to find a place that has tasty, authentic beans that are not dried out.  Chips and salsa are highly recommended, I am an enchilada girl so I usually get that.  OH and those margaritas are excellent.  Nice and heavy on that pour :) The first two times we went in here the cashier was so friendly and helpful, after the third she knew us by name!! I feel like I am having dinner at a friends, a friend who can actually cook good mexican food!!

Love this place! Great food and great prices. 1/4 chicken is more than enough food for one, choose between corn or flour tortillas and I always get a side of sour cream.  Staff isn't the friendliest, but easily overlooked by the quality of food. Don't forget to bring cash.

I love this place and especially this location! They have the best staff! The only issue is that if it gets busy (as it tends to do in the summer) they get a little unorganized.  Other than that they are on point, they have great suggestions when I am feeling something other than my banana with cream and they are always super friendly.  I love BB and if i HAD to I guess I'd go to another location but if I am even 25 miles within this one I am going here.  About their product, perfectly shaved ice and decision syrups and concoctions.  I have never had a 'chunk' of ice, that is how finely shaved it is!

Service, food, cleanliness, efficiency and cost is all A+! I will never eat Chinese anywhere else! The staff is so friendly and the atmosphere is fun and cozy. Very relaxed! A great little place tucked away in a strip mall! Sesame chicken, won ton soup and crab won-tons are a MUST!

I got a Groupon for this salon, not the most amazing Groupon ever but $29 for deluxe manicure and basic pedicure.  So we get there and I arrive early for my appointment and they get me started right away, we are off to a great start!  I think the owner is going to give me a manicure but apparently a chair has sprung a leak and he has to go fix it...no biggie.  I guess they had to get the guy off his smoke break though because it took him five minutes before he showed up and he wreaked of smoke, yuck! At least wash your hands!  Things go as normal until he decides to take a phone call, I never got his attention back.  Two guys showed up and he went outside and met them, in the middle of my manicure, and showed them inside and talked it up with the owner for awhile and finally remembered i was there and he finished my manicure up finally.  Did I mention when he went outside to meet them he took another smoke break?  Still didn't even bother to wash his hands.  Pedi time! Guess what? No water! It had to be turned off to take the chair out.  They finally get it back on but can't stop it, so there is water everywhere! Needless to say, dude did my pedi too and was so concerned about mopping up water and the putting in his two cents on the owner's discipline of his daughter that I got a real crappy pedi.  Didn't do the top coat and didn't get the sides or the top of the toenail.  Plus he dropped my shoes in the water and I had to climb over mounds of towels to get out of the chair.  I go to check out (I added gel and french to my mani so I had to pay extra) thinking for sure they would tell me no charge for one if not both...nope, that will be $20.  UGH! I am not one to throw a fit, and they are so lucky, but I usually feel comfortable at least asking for what I paid for.  Not with this guy, I didn't even want to talk at all, when I did i got the super evil eye....like when he was about to use purple polish for my gel nails.  The place could be nice, and the owner and his wife seem very sweet and personable, but they have a lot of work to do!  There was a huge pile of broken chairs, tables etc on the back wall and drills and garbage thrown everywhere.  So disappointed, and my husband even still gave them a tip, he's just that kinda guy.  I will not go back though and do NOT recommend business until they at least have their shop in working order! and please, get your guy to at least wash his hands after smoking!! The chairs were super old too and not very clean and my pedicure already chipped.

I had such a fantastic experience with Kim.  We clicked right away so the hour went by super fast.  She thought our appointment was at 3:30 and not 3:15 so she had ran to get some lunch and asked for some time to eat it when she returned at 3:05 (i was early) I told her no problem, figured I had some time so I started a game on my phone and she was back before i finished! My appointment was right on time! How refreshing that she made sure to keep me on schedule when the last person i went to get brazilian blowouts from had no disregard for my time at all! Not only was she timely but she is a pro!! I adore my hair, I have no frizzes or flyaways and this is the softest it has been since I was in Portland a few months ago (love what the rainy weather does for my hair but I need my sunshine). Also she keeps her customers at the LS price.  Kim will definitely be seeing me again! You should go see her too, you will not regret it!!

Not a fan, too expensive and the food is below average.  Everyone raved about this place so we had to try it.  Fail, i'll never go back.  Staff wasn't exactly friendly or attentive either.  Not a great selection and if you really want good street tacos go to Lulu's for 1/2 the price

Why isn't there a ZERO star?? How does it take you 35 minutes to bring my son his onion ring appetizer? It actually came out with our food. So sad bc our waitress seemed nice but the fact that our wait time was more than my allotted lunch time and we were there at 1115am with only three other tables and didn't leave until after 12:30 makes this the WORST joint for customer service. Not to mention the manager is a JERK, made you pay for extra dressing that they forgot.....no cash, put it on your card! Umm it costs your business more than 50 cents to process a 50 cent card transaction.  His answer? Don't like it don't come back. Really?! You have 4 tables during a rush lunch break and you can afford to basically tell your customer to screw off?  I just hope the waitresses go somewhere else bc I'm sure he hurts them in the tip area. If you're thinking about going to Zipps maybe think about keep traveling on a block or two west on University to Chili's (where Boston's used to be). They're just starting out and still 137 times better in every area this this place. Btw, food was ok, same level as Chili's though and again you'll get better customer service from them than Mr Manager of Mill Ave Zipps could even fathom....137 ZERO stars. I have no idea how they are still in business!!

Excellent coffee, the owner recommended the red velvet and even found a way to add extra espresso and not make it to watery.  Very friendly and reasonably priced.  I'd give it a five but the bakery goods had flies inside the container.  I've only been once so i am not saying this is the norm, could have just been one of those days :) I do wish she had earlier hours, i would definitely be there more often!!
