I've been looking for a good French restaurant in Phoenix and have finally food it.  If you like French food, you'll love Coup Des Tartes. I went here for restaurant week and the food was fantastic. French food is best know for its flavor and sauces and Coup Des Tartes hits it on the spot! I had the spare ribs, the BF had the filet and they were cooked to perfection with a light tomato base sauce on mine and grilled onions on his.  For dessert we had the cream brûlée and the chocolate carmel tart. The cream brûlée was good but the chocolate carmel tart was awesome!  I'm going back this weekend and taking my family. The service was average but the owner was very nice. Nice ambiance too, romantic but also family worthy. I wouldn't bring small kids, the restaurant is small and the tables are close together just like the authentic French restaurant feeling.  Bon a petite

Definitely!  City Wide Pest Control has good service and a great price.   The technicians are always on time and friendly they will show up as early as 7am if you need. They have a 21 day warranty if it rains and the price is less than any other company I have used.    There is no contract or agreement needed and you can have them call you monthly to set up service or you can call them on a as needed basis.  I definitely recommend them.

Thai fusion is more like it.  I love Thai food but Malee's is more Thai fusion.  Don't come here if you're looking for authentic Thai food. The food is alright, there are dishes on the menu that you won't find in normal thai cuisine like the Crispy Calamari Salad, although it was good.  They pump up the AC so the room is freezing and I think the building is old because the acoustics are awful. You can hear every conversation in the room and it's all echoing so you won't be able to hear yourself think!  If you don't mind less than average Thai food, freezing conditons and lots of noise than Malee's is the place for you.  I probably won't be back...

Amazing Food!!   You can't go wrong at Bandera. The food here is soooo good. I've had the Artichoke appetizer, the side salad and the prime rib, ribs, fish sandwich and chicken for entrees and don't forget about the banana cream pie! The artichoke is served with a delicious mayo like with lots of seasonings sauce, the salad comes with goat cheese and a deviled egg and the entrees all come with your choice of a unique side such as maple sauce carrots, red cabbage with goat cheese or whatever the side of the night is. The chicken which is suppose to be their signature dish is ok, not much flavor to it but everything else I've had there is to die for!   My boyfriend is quite particular about where we go to eat but would love to go to Bandera every night of the week if we could.   One warning: Ladies - the floor is very slick so make sure you wear shoes that have some grip on them. Last time I was there I almost did the splits but was saved by the guard rail on the 3 stairs up to the dinner area. Embarrassing...

Gelato love!  I have traveled near and far, high and low and this is the best gelato I've tasted in the US!  It comes the closest to the gelato made in Italy.  It's creamy with rich flavors and my mouth feels like it's in heaven every time I eat it.  I have visited a few different locations around town and they are always consistently delicious.  The staff is nice and the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting.  The Old Town location has a few comfortable lounging chairs with armrests and free wifi.  This is the perfect place to take a break and to get away from the AZ heat.  Definitely check it out.  You'll be addicted, I am!

Nails look good but awful service!  I went to NY Nails for a pedi and a mani.  I paid $35 for both, no salt scrub but I did upgrade to a french manicure.  The massage on the legs and feet were painful, Way too much pressure, I'm surprised he didn't notice I was almost in tears from the pain and there was no massage on the hands.  By the time I left I had 3 different nail techs work on me. I though that was weird and rude. They just passed me off to the next tech when one had to leave and I got there 1 hour before closing.  When it was time to pay I had a gift certificate which I didn't realize had expired a few month earlier. NY nails is a family owned salon and they refused to take the gift certificate even though they could have but they are too selfish and by not honoring it I will never go there again.  I even gave them a 20% tip and the service was awful and they made me feel unimportant as a customer.   As for the nails, they do look good, the polish hasn't chipped much in the 5 days I've had them done but this place is not worth the bad service and cost.

Decent food, bad service, dirty bathroom and chairs that fall apart  We decided to go here because it's right next to the museum but will never go back.  The service was bad, it looked like they didn't have enough servers on to handle the amount of tables. We never got drink refills and eventually ended up going to the bar to get them even though we had asked the server for them but he never brought any.  The picnic table we sat at was unstable and I was afraid the entire time we were there that the bench was going to break at any second. The table next to us ended up falling through their chair though, luckily no one was hurt.  The food was alright but, not good enough to go back for a second time.   My boyfriend complained about the dirty bathroom. If he complained about it, it was bad!  I suggest going down the street to find something better, anything will be better than here.

Thai Elephant is the best Thai food I've had in AZ!  The food is delicious and I'll drive down from Scottsdale just to eat  here.  There are many  closer thai restaurants to me than Thai Elephant but none compare.  I usually get the pad thai, green curry, change up the 3rd dish and a thai iced tea.  I have never been dissapointed.  The prices are reasonable, the service is fine and the only thing I would change would be to make the thai iced teas bigger, the're not small but La's thai and Thai house in scottsdale give you bigger glasses.  If you're looking for good thai, definitely come here!

The Thai food here is pretty good. The service is your typical Asian service :/ and the Thai iced tea is a great deal. It comes in a big glass and is delicious! For only $2!!  I'll be getting take out from here often.

Use to be good but no more...  The first 4 times I came here the food was amazing! But they have decided to change the menu and I will not be back.  For this last visit I had the Apple salad and the chicken Parmesan. Both mine and my boyfriend's salad (both apple salads) tasted like someone has dropped the salt shaker into them. When we told the waitress how salty they were her reply was "that's weird I eat that all the time and it's not salty". It was so salty it was unbearable to eat.  When the chicken Parmesan came out it looked good but that was not the case. It was bland and it use to come with a side of spaghetti. With the menu change they took away the spaghetti and instead put penne pasta on top of the chicken under the cheese.  Due to the bad service and not so yummy food, I won't be back. Too bad I really liked Marcella's before the menu change.

Great facial great customer service  One Love Boutique Spa consists of the waiting room/reception area and the services room.  Its small, cozy but super cute and inviting. I love the way it's decorated which is what drew me to buy a Groupon for a signature facial after looking at the website. The decor is white, clean, girly and classic.  I was disappointed at first when my initial appointment was cancelled two hours before I was scheduled due to Amanda coming down with something that was contagious, I guess I was thankful too.  When I came in for my facial I explained that I was one of the appointments that was rescheduled due to her illness and she upgraded me to the anti aging facial for free!  She also includes eyebrow waxing with every facial which is awesome! The facial was AMAZING and Amanda is very knowledgeable about what she is doing and the products she is using.   Before my facial started I had asked her to mess up my hair as little as possible since I was going somewhere right after, she kindly obliged  and when I left my hair looked exactly how it looked when I came in.  Amanda is great and I will definitely be back!

I had gotten a letter from the city to have the palm tress in my yard trimmed. They hadn't been trimmed in over 2 years and needed it badly!!  On Friday afternoon I called 4 tree trimming services and Macias Landscaping came out that following Saturday and called me with a quote that afternoon.  Macias Landscaping was the best priced bid I received. So I called Macias Landscaping on Tuesday and they were back at my house trimming the palm trees on Wednesday morning at 6:30am so that I could check to see that their work met my expectations before leaving for work.  They did the job quickly and the most cost effective of 4 companies.  Alis Macias was very courteous and professional.  And they did a Great job on the palm trees too, I didn't even recognize my house!  I would definitely recommend Alis Macias and I will use them again.
