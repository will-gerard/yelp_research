Terrible!  Ordered pepperoni pizza and wings ($25). Wings were fatty disgusting and soggy. Pizza was mediocre at best. I will never order from this place again. I have no idea how they are still in business.

Just like home!  Had a Chicago Style double sausage and it was amazing!  This is my favorite pizza place in Phoenix.

I love this shop!  Honest Bob is my artist and his work is thoughtful and beautiful.  The shop atmosphere is so much fun. The music and conversation are stimulating. I love being there.  I have 2 completed pieces by Bob and have at least 2 more that are soon to be put on. This shop rules!

I had my very first facial today.  D'Lisa was AMAZING!  You can tell she really loves what she does. She explained what each step was. I felt very pampered. Looks like a facial is going to become part of my 'lady maintenance'. Thanks for a great job!  I'll definitely be back to see you!

I love this salon!  D'Lisa run the most amazing business. Her waxing work is impeccable.  Today I showed up thinking I had a hair color appointment but I accidentally made the appointment for the wrong day. She figured out a way to fit me in and I am So grateful because I have been looking forward to getting this done and I took off work to do it. Awesome amazing service!

How happy am I??!!  I have waited for this day to come for over 10 years (since I moved here from the 'burbs of Chi-Town.  It tasted just like heaven I had my usual- Frisco Melt, cheese fries and a cup of chili. It was...... Heavenly. I love you so much Steak N Shake, enough to marry you if I could. I'll be back.  Sooner than later.
