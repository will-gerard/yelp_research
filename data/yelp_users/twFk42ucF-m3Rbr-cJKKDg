Place was way understaffed. We made a reservation then checked in 30 mins before cosmic bowling started at 10. They still didn't have 2 Lanes available until 10:26. Perhaps they shouldn't let a high school student coordinate the lane logistics. Only one person running the bar so expect to wait 20 minutes for a drink. There were no table waitresses. Stars earned for good food and getting shoes was quick.

Outstanding food and service! We had a large party for brunch, but the waitress handled everyone's request with ease. The service was fantastic; the food came out quickly, and accurately. Everything was delicious and the make your own drink bar was original and fun. I will be back!

Friendly staff but disappointing visit. I made a 2 pm appt a few days ago yet my car wasn't taken back to the garage until 235.

This is one of my favorite places to visit. I first visited with my grandma when I was a little kid. The staff is always friendly and fast. I've never eaten food here, but the ice cream menu is expansive and delicious. They even have an arcade for kiddos.

The place reeked of Portabello mushrooms when you walk in, which was off-putting. The place wasn't packed, but did have some tables. We had terrible service. We waited forever for our waiter to come back to take our order, our water glasses were empty more often than full, and the food took too long. We had ordered a beer with the pizza and we each ate two pieces before we told another staff member to cancel the beer. We waited again to get our check and for them to pick it up. The food wasn't anything special. Then the manager came over as we were getting our check to ask how everything was right next to the waiter. He was walking away as he asked the question so clearly he didn't care.  I wouldn't go again.

Incredibly delicious, authentic food for a great price. Large portions and SUPER fast service. They have a fantastic international grocery store too. The gyros, hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, and chicken swarma are my favorites.

I walked in on a Saturday, mid morning so of course the place was packed and the line was long. I was rightfully appreciative to find a well integrated staff. The girl at the counter knew the details of the menu and was able To multi task well. She truly was a huge reason the line moved quickly, orders got put in and moved along. The staff making the sandwiches and running the registered were also handling multiple things at a time but were fabulously efficient. The only staff member who wasn't in synch was the young girl making the drinks. High school girl looked like it was way too early to be up, phone in her back pocket and was still learning the menu. I saw her have to remake a few things. However, she was pleasant to customers. I have one slight dissapointment- I bought a dozen box and it was suppose to come with 13 bagels but when I got home the girl at the counter miscounted because there were only 12. Not the end of the world, but I should get what I paid for.

Intimate restaurant worth eating at! The food was delicious. The  menu is small, but they will make you any dish you request. It's nice to find a place that goes above and beyond. They offer a great happy hour.   P.S.- Get the fried calamari! Ever since I've had theirs, no one can compare.

Great service. I went online to place my pick up order. I arrived at the location and the guy was on the phone but smiled and waived. The guy making pizza immediately said hello and said they would be with me shortly. I told him I was picking up but they didn't have my order. I had a confirmation number on their website but I checked my email and didn't get a confirmation email so I must have not finished my order correctly. I have ordered online before so I'm not sure what I did, but clearly it was my error. He helped take my order and they made the pizzas immediately. He estimated 15 minutes but had the pizza out in just after 10 minutes. They were courteous and the service was fast. Great job!

In one word- disappointing. Pompous waitstaff . Then menu looks original and everything sounds fantastic. The plate presentations are beautiful, but then you taste it...underwhelming at best. I wouldn't go back.

Food is good. Excellent waffles! I'm not a huge chicken on the bone fan, but theirs is decent. Always good service. Parking is a pain and they don't take RSVPs so expect to wait.

My friend and I were originally planning to head to Havana cafe for cuban food when we realized the Arcadia location closed in April. I searched desperately to find something that could quench my craving and came across Millie's Cafe on Yelp. My friend agreed to drive about 30 minutes to meet me at the location so I was really hoping we wouldn't be dissapointed.  We were not.  I got there first and was surprised to see how small the restaurant was. However, my initial concern was immediately suppressed by the welcoming owner, whose restaurant was named after his mother in law as I learned. He was kind and went through the entire menu with me. I waited for my friend before we ordered and his mother in law took our order; she was equally as kind. He came over during the order to make sure we didn't have any other questions. Our food came out quickly and was delicious. We ordered a variety of appetizers so we could try everything. The place was authentic, as evidenced by a friendly customer who joked, "your not Puerto Rican."   The place is small- only 3 tables, and the menu isn't huge, but, everything on it is spectacular and the prices are unbeatable. It happens to be pretty close to me, so I will be back for sure.  P.S. Millie, makes an unbelievable hot sauce like nothing I've ever tried before. Ask for it.

Really great feel to the restaurant. Definitely hipster. Food was really good but didn't like their sangria. Great place to go if your downtown for happy hour.

The store owners are personsable and welcoming. They offer bi-monthly byob paint and wine courses for $25. Ada is a lovely and pacient instructor which makes the classes a lot of fun. She even takes the time to make an impressive snack tray. I was hooked after my first class and am now a regular student. Worth checking out!

This was my first time to the restaurant and I was impressed. The staff was friendly and the restaurant and restrooms were clean. The service was awesome and I can't say enough about the food. Everything's from scratch and incredibly delicious. I love being able to support a family business! Can't wait to go back soon!

I am totally disgusted with this restaurant.   I first visited this restaurant last weekend after hearing good things about their food. My visit was enjoyable- the food was delicious and tasted like it was made from scratch. The waitress was nice and the prices were reasonable. I was excited about my visit so I told invited a friend to join me the following weekend.  My friend and I went for breakfast this morning (now a week later) and it was like I went to an entirely different restaurant. The place was busy but we were able to get a table immediately. The waitress was in a bad mood from the time we sat down. My friend ordered coffee and juice and the waitress looked at her like she was crazy. She came back 3 times within 5 minutes to ask if we were ready to order after we told her we needed time. She was annoyed that my friend needed more time and then asked a question about the menu. I know it must have been terribly inconvenient for the waitress to do her job. The food came out in about 20-30 minutes. The food tasted good, just like my last visit. When we were only half way through our food, she brought us our bill and asked us if we needed anything else. We told her we were fine, but were just finishing our food and chatting. She came by 5 times in 10 minutes asking if we needed anything else so we would hurry up and pay the bill and leave. She had another waitress come ask us if we needed anything else within those 10 minutes as well. Then, my friend took out her card and had it on the table and I was getting out my card and the manager came and without saying a word grabbed the bill and walked away. I tried to stop him but he wouldn't turn around. I had to flag down the waitress to bring our bill back as we had two separate bills and my card hadn't been added yet. Then, the hostess, who is probably the snootiest young lady I've ever met came and said "can I take this" referring to the book t hat the bill is held in and didn't wait for a response before grabbing it and walking away. She came back saying she needed the other receipt and I told her I wasn't done yet but I would leave it when I was. I could see the manager, and several of the staff pointing and talking about us (on more than one occasion) at the hostess station which was 3 booths away.  I have never felt so bullied at a restaurant in my entire life!  Since when is it a crime to talk with your party when you are out a restaurant? We were only there for about 1 1/2 hours from the time we sat down to the time we left which is not an exuberant amount of time. Furthermore, there were many open tables elsewhere. Regardless of whether there are tables open or not, there is no reason for a restaurant staff to bother guests to get them to leave. The manager has no place in management.   The only reason my waitress got a tip was so the hard working buser got a portion of the money. She certainly didn't deserve one.  The restaurant deserves an F in manners, customers service, atmosphere, hospitality, and professionalism. I'm completely embarrassed that I spoke so highly of it to my friend who had to experience such terrible and rude service.   Good luck staying open.

We went on a Saturday evening. They were well staffed so the ticket and concession lines were very short. All the staff new knew their job and worked efficiently. The bathrooms were clean.

I think this places's menu looks amazing! I saw their fb post stating one of their trucks would be near my house last night. I was so excited! I told my friend about it at work that day and we drooled over the options we could create. We finally had our minds set on what we wanted to order.   The fb flyer said 5-9 and the company even posted an announcement around 5 saying it wasn't raining and encouraging everyone to come out. I drove by on my way home about 530 but didn't see them off Dobson. In figured they must have been back off southern closer to the fields.   I went back at 815. I drove around the entire Mcc campus looking for the truck they said would be by the rose garden. I posted a message on their announcement  saying I couldn't find their truck. No reply. I drove around the entire campus again thinking I must have missed it since the event went until 9. No truck. I left.  I privately messaged the company in fb letting them know what happened.   This is the message I sent them: "I have to tell you I am extremely dissapointed. I live really close to Mcc and drove by southern and Dobson around 530 this evening but couldn't see your truck. I came back at 815 tonight and drove everywhere on the Mcc campus. All four parking lots, streets weaving in and out of the campus- literally everywhere. Your truck was not there. My friend and I had been looking forward to trying your waffles for the first time all day. And you let us down. "  I expected a response saying something like I'm really sorry you couldn't find us. We are so glad you came out to see us. Let's see how we can make your experience better. Nope.  Instead, i got a response saying "it's not our fault" the event ended early because of the rain.   Here is the response I got: "Hi Chelsie! Sorry you were disappointed. we were definitely there until 7:50. We cannot help when an event is canceled due to rain, we were invited to this event and we were the last truck to leave. It was out of our control! We are in Mesa a lot so come see us again:)"  I can assure you, waffle love, you absolutely could have posted that you were leaving the event on your fb announcement so any customer planning to come between 7:50-9 didn't waste their time and gas trying to find your truck. Knowing you left early, you should have checked your fb announcements for people saying they couldn't find you.  Your company has terrible customer service. Whoever responds to your fb messages should be fired for their inept people skills. I gave your company the courtesy to contact you directly to resolve the issue and you missed the opportunity to correct the issue and places blame on someone else.   No, I will not be "coming to see you again". I am happy to support the other waffle trucks. #i'll be going to wafflecrush.
