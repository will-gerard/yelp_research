I have worked with speedy glass for years. They have replaced my windshield twice over the last couple years - one of the joys of living in a rural area - and are always professional and respectful. Never had any problems with the work done and love that they use manufacturer glass. Thank you speedy!

The surf and turf taco plate was amazing! Great combination of flavors and a perfect portion size too. Definitely order it again! Had to take a star away just because of the cleanliness of the restaurant. Next time I will just get the order to go.

I cannot remember the last time I have ordered at this location and actually got what I ordered.  Used to think it was maybe because I would order something special like no onion or no mayo. Well the other night I ordered 2 southwest chicken salads with grilled chicken. Surprise! order wrong again. This time no chicken on either salad. So tired of this.

Have to say I love this place. Usually order take out vs eating there but they are always very friendly when we go in.   Food is yummy, the price is right and service is quick.  Would have given 5 stars if they would deliver lol!

Always friendly and helpful. Have worked with them for years. Love that they always smile when I walk in and are always very helpful with anything I need. Some may complain that postage is a bit higher but I gladly pay the small difference to be able to stay in San tan valley, avoid the post office lines and support a local business.  Teresa and her Staff are awesome!

Both Dr Bocks are awesome! And I love the staff. Super friendly, very knowledgeable and not pushy! I like the holistic approach with emphasis on nutrition that they bring to the table. Dr Louis Bock has worked on my son, my daughter and my husband and they've all been happy with the service and the results. Not just a chiropractic office! They offer massage, nutritional counseling, therapy,  classes and more. Love them!

Had a great time! We had a group of local businesses (San Tan Leads) get together this morning and it rocked! Carmen took great care of us and the buffet breakfast was awesome! Definitely recommend them for a group meeting place!

Big shout out to Karli! Big smile, so friendly and not at all pushy. We had stopped in before heading to the movies for a quick snack. Got milkshakes,  fries and a root beer float. I was sharing a milkshake with my daughter and Karli asked if she could split it for us! Might sound like a small thing but for us it just showed that she was being proactive and thoughtful. Then the icing on the cake - or the ketchup on the plate - was that she actually took the time to make little designs on ketchup plates for each of us for our fries - there were 4 in our party. Rest of the staff was very pleasant too but Karli rocked!  Thank you!

So disappointed. Not only was the service lacking but the food was not good.  Wanted to try out the new pastrami sandwich.  Asked the "supervisor" who told me he thought it was pork and something else. Then clarified to tell me it was just some weird mystery meat. After waiting for almost 5 min to finish order, I then asked if he would please go confirm that it was beef pastrami.  Finally he did. Spent $9 on the sandwich and could barely eat it. Soggy wet bread, pastrami had no flavor - just a total disappointment.  The only somewhat decent part of the order was the brand new employee who while timing and unsure if herself at least tried to provide customer service. Won't be back to this location again.

Have definitely had some challenges over the years, but I am glad that it seems to be turning around.  Jason is awesome and the girls are amazing!  Haven't been out on a Friday night in a while and stopped in to hear the music of the RJ band - Robert and Joel were incredible! Great energy, great music!  Wish I could have stayed longer!

The portions are incredible!  Can't even fit the breakfast burrito on the plate!  Love the big mugs for coffee and Alice is such a doll!  Would have given it 5 stars if they were located in San Tan Valley :)

Love that I am greeted when I walk in - with eye contact too. Staff is friendly and helpful. Sometimes a little slow on checkout but all and all a good experience.  I always forget my loyalty card and they remind me each time to just enter my phone number so I still get the discounts.

Have to give a shout out to Hannah. What A remarkable lady! We spent the last couple weeks at the Doubletree for work and spent most of the mornings with Hannah waiting on us. She is a doll! The food was amazing (especially the flat bread) and the service was incredible.  Never felt so welcomed before.   We will miss seeing Hannah's smile each day but will be back as soon as we can!

Was so excited when a pediatrician was opening up in San tan valley. Then I met Dr Vaughan and I was even more excited. So knowledgeable,  friendly and it is obvious that he loves what he does. I recommend him to everyone I meet. Just wish my kids were younger so we could still see him lol.

Absolutely incredible!  Not only does Garrett do great work, but his pricing is incredible too.  Never looked forward to getting my carpets done in the past, but now I have him on auto schedule lol.  Thanks so much for doing such a great job every time!  Oh and don't forget they do car upholstery and tile too!

YUMMY!! One of my very favorite places to go for breakfast, lunch, dinner or dessert in San Tan Valley!  The Chicken Marsala and Cookie Brownie Sundae are INCREDIBLE and so are the quesadillas, the wraps, heck everything!  Great sized portions!  Affordable prices.  Love the quaint feel of the restaurant & Lisa & Kevan are great peeps!

Have to say that Josh is awesome! Out in San tan valley we've had some bad experiences with security companies.  You should be able to trust the company you are asking to secure your home or office.  Now with Josh and smart security we do! Call Josh at 6027338644 to get set up.

I've been to this location twice in the last few months with last night being the 2nd time.  Each time I have been pleased that the establishment was clean, quiet, and not too crowded.  Last night I ordered the mongollian beef and broccoli. The beef was super tasty with a great smokey flavor and the broccoli was crisp! Only complaint, way too much sauce.  Had ordered brown rice and by the time I got down to the rice it looked like soup with rice in it.  It did take a bit longer to get the order once it was ordered and the guy calling  out the numbers had to have been whispering because I couldn't hear a thing he said lol.  All that said however, I will definitely be back and next time I'm going for the Dan Dan :)

Bruce is awesome! Used to have problems with handymen showing up late or not at all. Not Bruce!  Bruce is always early. Does great work and stands by his quote.  He isn't the cheapest but I've learned I get what I pay for. Appreciate that he won't try to do something he can't do. Have been referred to other reputable contractors to do jobs Bruce doesn't do. Highly recommend him!

In previous homes I had high maintenance yards - beautiful - but high maintenance - after years of being disappointed with the landscape companies I had hired, I decided to downgrade and stick with desert landscape.  Then I found Dave with DT Landscape!  Always shows when he says he will, great pricing (quote and what I pay always match) and has some great ideas on what plants will last - (I can kill a silk plant).  So now that Dave has been taking care of my yard for almost a year, I am thinking about upgrading the yard to something that needs more maintenance - and I know Dave will take good care of it all!

Have to say I am super bummed. Guess I got spoiled at the queen Creek location so maybe my expectations were higher than they should have been. That said let me tell you the positives: place was relatively clean although we did need our table cleaned before we could sit down. The staff was welcoming, pleasant and helpful and the food came out pretty quickly - interesting that they delivered each dish when it was ready vs the whole order at once.  So with all the good so far what went wrong right?  Well it was the food. I ordered a create your own - as I always do - and while the burger was hot in temperature that was all the good I can share. The lettuce was limp and barely covered the bun, there was almost no sauce,  the pickles and jalape√±os were very small - not like at the qc spot when you get big thick junks of crisp vegetables - and the burger could not have been greasier. Now I have a major problem with wet bread and not only did I go threw a bunch of napkins trying to dry off the bun and patty but there was actually a puddle in my plate before I could even finish. Had I ordered take out I wouldn't have had anything good to share about the experience. Oh and lastly the constant "bugging" if things can be taken away made me feel like I needed to hurry up and get out. Super bummed.

Yum! Ordered the tom kha gai soup - medium heat. Very tasty and good portion. Will add more heat next time as it was pretty mild spice. Odd to be eating Thai food with country music playing. Loved the blackberry Jasmine iced tea too. Definitely coming back
