Drive thru is sloooooooow. How slow? I had enough time to create a yelp account and write this review. I have two cars in front of me, c'mon Del Taco!

I'm most excited about the beer selection. They're doing an excellent job of bringing in some amazing craft beers that are hard to find. They also have a great selection of more common craft beers. One of the benefits they have is they still seem to be a secret, so the hard to find beers they get on tap actually stay around for a few days if not a week or two.   The food is good and gets better every time I visit.  To top it off, the service has been great. The Hungry Monk is a welcomed addition to the local craft beer scene.

My wife works close to down town and this is her favorite coffee shop, I can see why. Excellent drinks, friendly service, and a welcoming, comfortable hip atmosphere. The pour over coffee is great, the macchiatos are the best I had--I've been spoiled by the side of sparkling water that comes with the drink. Their iced drinks are excellent as well--they have a technique of making the iced drinks that makes the beverage ice cold and not watered down. Great flavor all around, consistently good product and consistently good service.

I'm not downtown often so when I was in the area for a workshop I was excited to check out the 1st Street Cartel location. Didn't have a lot of time to enjoy the atmosphere but it was an interesting place. The guy working the coffee bar was excellent, friendly and made a flavorful cup of coffee with the V60. Their wifi was on the fritz so the payment system was down. The barista apologized and gave me the coffee on the house. Wish I lived closer to this location as it was an excellent experience and the coffee lived up to the reputation.

Good food, great craft beer selection including some local options and even an IPA from one of my favorite breweries in San Diego, Pizza Port. I had a few of the street tacos and they were all delicious, my only complaint is there was so much loaded in the taco the tortilla didn't hold up. I had a tough time ordering because there were a lot of good looking options on the menu. The staff were attentive and took care of everything, even when an order didn't come out right they took care of it right away. Great addition to the strip.
