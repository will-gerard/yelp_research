Very upset at this place,  I'm outside in the beer garden having a cigarette when the owner came up to me and said that I smell pot on my person. I told him that I was a medical patient and that I medicated before I got to the bar.  He told me not to smoke in the parking lot.  I told him I haven't,  that I know the laws. Then he accused me of smoking in the parking lot.  I really feel discriminated here and I will not come back.  Even when u respect their rules, they feel they can just discriminate u and call u out in front of everyone. Definitely will not be coming back
