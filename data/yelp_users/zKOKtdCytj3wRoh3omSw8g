OK, I am a Certified BBQ Judge, and was very disappoint with my visit Sunday night.    Cold food, ribs had no meat on them, even my 6 year old said 'wow they don't have a good cook here daddy'  Out of forks, out of salad?    Waited 40 min for cold food?  Please explain....  And one of the dirtiest bathrooms I have every seen.

Wish there was an option for no stars.  Food was bad!  Salad bar dressing had a film on top for sitting so long.  Should not be called a smoke house, I would bet they use an electric smoker and use particle board since that's what the food tasted like.  Bad sause, poor tasting meat!  The McRib is a better option.
