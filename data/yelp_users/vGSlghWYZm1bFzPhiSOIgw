This place is a complete mess. Why take reservations when you can't even feed the paying guests? We came here for Mother's Day and it was ruined. Don't go to this place if you want a laid back brunch. Absolutely terrible service.

Such a great workout!  So happy they finally opened up a location that is close to where I live and with convenient times with a busy work schedule!  The facility is very clean and much larger than the other OTF studios that I have been to so it makes it easy to switch between stations.  Matt and the other new trainers do a great job of keeping you motivated and explaining the OTF experience to newbies.  It's rare for me to find a workout that I want to keep returning to but OTF has definitely become that for me and in fact I can't wait to go back this evening!  Keep it up!

Dr. Walter is such a wonderful dermatologist!  She, along with her office and staff, were warm and welcoming and made me feel very comfortable.  She's willing to listen and give her input and listen to any concerns you may have.  I will definitely be returning here for all of my dermatology needs!  Also, she has a couple of great skin lines and face lotions that smell great!
