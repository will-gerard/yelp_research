We do not buy our cars here I am just here for a recall. Normally we're down the street at camelback Toyota. Well they must have spoiled us there because the service here sucks. Maybe it's just the one guy "rich" that has a poor argumentative attitude with each customer I've seen him deal with in the 3+ hours I've been waiting but I will not be returning again. If you're looking to buy a car, seriously go to camelback Toyota... They've treated us like kings the many times I've gone there

My experience with Coulter Cadillac was horrible. I am so upset at the poor customer service I received. They found a screw in a tire and patched it while they were in there fixing a recall... HOWEVER today (a few weeks later) we went to replace 2 other tires with Discount and they told us Coulter had patched OVER the screw and now we needed to replace that tire as well. When I called to speak with the service manager, John Thorne, he was extremely rude. He denied that they would do that and every time I tried to speak he would interrupt me. (SO extremely rude!) I tried to ask questions regarding their procedures multiple times and he would not let me talk. I was so frustrated and now we're having to immediately replace an expensive tire that we do not have in our budget. He kept telling me that its probably a plug they put in when they patch a tire. WELL I'm PRETTY SURE that Discount tire knows the difference between a plug and a screw they patched over. We are taking the tire back to Coulter to address it and we will see how it is handled from there. Do yourself a favor and GO ELSEWHERE!

I come for my morning treats at LEASt once a week. I never feel rushed and they always my the best coffees and bakery items. They remember me and I feel like I always get a great start to my day when I stop here. Pastries are amazing and I often get a coconut latte. Perfect little hang out spot for when you have some free time as well.

I LOVE Einstein bagels. A LOT. Bet bagels I have had. We live right by this location and go there often but today was my last time I will go to this specific one. It is so dirty. I will give them a break that yes it was Presidents' Day so they were probably busy ... But there was trash on every table, all over the floor, the coffee bar area was disgusting, and the last straw was the gross bathroom. You can tell it had not been cleaned in months. There was so much grime on the sink and the paper towel dispenser I was majorly grossed out. It makes me wonder how clean the kitchen area really was. My order was wrong which Happens no big deal... On top of that I have never had good customer service there- next time I will drive the extra 10 minutes out of my way to the location on Tatum and shea's- they're always friendly and it's very clean there.

I have two daughters, ages 3 and 4 and we have been going there since our doctor recommended around my oldest's first birthday. We have been to a lot of medical offices and I have never been so impressed by the Doctors and staff here! They really know how to meet my daughters on their level! The first few visits, my oldest was pretty apprehensive because of some bad medical experiences she had with doctors early in life... but they really focused on her helping her calm down. Dr. Tim even sang her songs. They are the most gentle people I have ever had deal with my kids.  Even the hygienist, Katie, took the time to find out what my girls were interested in to discuss with at their appointments, and remember when we can back! Its really been our dental home and the girls look forward to going every 6 months!!

I was so grossed out eating here! The entire place was dirty... They're doing some remodeling, but no excuse! The drink area was gross, most of the tables were dirty, the cashier obviously hates her job... I very rarely write a bad review but I wanted someone else to be warned before they come to this restaurant!! They need someone from corporate to come evaluate it and clean it up! Even the bathroom was worse than a ghetto gas station. I will not be returning to this location.

Black and white mocha is the best. It can get super busy though so late mornings are hard to find a spot and there is a line but it is WELL worth it

I just had the most amazing vegan chocolate chip walnut cookie of my life. I've been missing out on cookies since I've developed an egg allergy and this place has the PERFECT recipe!!!

I'm actually down the street right now dealing with a different dealership missing the amazing customer service we receive at camelback Toyota. We have bought many cars from them as well as used their service department regularly and they always treat us like kings. Every experience I've had has left me feeling appreciated and well taken care of. I'm only at another dealership because of a gmc recall. If you're looking to buy a car, this is a great place to go!!!

I've tried a few nail salons in the area and always come back here!!! It is definitely a fancy experience- your nail technician is focused on you rather than chatting with the other employees- they're so personable and professional and the salon itself is so chic!! My husband even went with me today and had a relaxing pedicure. Summer did my nails and she was awesome!!! I won't go to another salon!

Best of the BEST!!! I've done my own color for years and I was really hesitant to have someone else make some drastic changes for me. I went from black hair to platinum blonde and quite a few of my hair dresser friends thought I was crazy - Lauren was up for the challenge! She is AMAZING with color, my cut is always PERFECT and on top of that she always educates me on how to care for my hair for my specific needs. She always directs me to the best products and explains how to use them (something no one else has done for me)   To top that off, her salon is beautiful! Amazing atmosphere and Funky style. I will refer her to every single person that compliments my hair! She's the best! You will be amazed!

Always delicious food and AMAZING customer service. Sweet potato fries and their RANCH is MMMMM. Everyone always has a smile on their face and he few times there was a mistake they were sure to fix it above and beyond expectation with a happy attitude. I always get either the mushroom Swiss burger or the tuna steak on French roll. We have some food allergies and they're always accommodating and willing to look at their ingredients. This is our number one fast food staple when we're in a hurry- my only complaint is there isn't one super close to our home :) soon habit! Soon!

First time and it is my new favorite breakfast spot!!!! I couldn't decide which of their amazing pancakes to try and they have a "flight of pancakes" which you can choose 3- I tried strawberry rhubarb with marscapone cream, blueberry, and sweet potato which has Carmel sauce and pecans- I still can't decide which was my favorite!! Also the waitress was awesome!! She brought us a "cake of the day" to try (apple and nuts topped with a cinnamon pastry) which was amazing (salty and sweet) AND when my husband ordered a Bloody Mary, she brought me a complimentary virgin orange snoozius because I'm 9months pregnant and she knew I couldn't have the alcohol. I will definitely be back and often!!!!!

I've been on the hunt for a closer decent coffee shop. I've lived in the area for years and finally decided to give it a try- wish we would have come years ago!!! Delicious food- delicious coffee (cartel by far is he best ever!) and I will be visiting frequently. Super cute interior... Awesome menu for allergy sensitive customers!! My only complaint is that I wish they were open earlier so I could stop on my way to work and later so I could visit after :)

We are huge fans of jimmy John's - we order it on a regular basis for work and home HOWEVER THIS LOCATION has really disappointed us. It takes a lot for me to write a bad review. We have been ordering for work at least 3-4 times per week for delivery. Long story short, the delivery driver never showed (was lost at another delivery) and after 50mins of waiting I went to pick it up myself. I had called the store to be SURE my order was still there or if it was enroute (it was still there according to their staff). When i showed up at the store there was no order. They offered to make my food again (duh that's why i'm there) however were very annoyed when i asked them to not charge me for the delivery fee and tip i placed for the driver. (i'm not paying for delivery if i have to pick it up myself! again DUH!) She slammed my cups on the counter and then offered to make my lunch for free- however even with that (which i did appreciate) they did not even make my food how i ordered it- all it was was meat and lettuce. It's very unfortunate because now they've lost a long time and frequent customer. This is not the first experience we've had along these same lines - probably more like the 4th or 5th. Hope they can get their stuff together or they're going to loose a lot more customers. Also, never was there a manager available to discuss with.

DELICIOUS! really great service and HUGE portions. Very fresh and hip atmosphere. Lots of attention to detail. There is a huge out door seating area lots of interesting flavors for pancakes. I really wanted a coffee but didn't and the espresso smelled SO GOOD. This place is great!!! We went on our lunch hour and it was quick service for a large group!
