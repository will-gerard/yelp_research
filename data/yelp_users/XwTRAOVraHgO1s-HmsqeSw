Have visited this location a few times. Each visit it's virtually the same.   The employees are laid back but helpful, and are welcoming.  We come here for just a handful of specific items. And they have it in stock every single time we are here :)  The parking is ample.   Registers open up as it gets busier.  We will continue shopping here.

Popped by without an appointment. Gordon and team was cordial at the least.  Price quoted was the price charged. Gordon went through with me the result of 21 point inspection.  Repairs were completed at promised time. The place was clean and organised. Was allowed to used my student discount.  Will recommend, and will return again!  ^_^  Xx

Staff/cashier seemed (to us) she rather be elsewhere than working. Tepid reception. No "aloha" attitude in  Hawaiian spot.  Prices were slightly on the pricey side after recieving our dishes. Portions were small for the price they charged us.   Location is closer to us than Aloha Kitchen... A plus! ^_^ Love the decor, and the al fresca seating.  We also order a coconut smoothie which the server/cashier forgot to serve to us (her mates came over and started socialising instead). We had to remind her that we also order the smoothie a couple of times. Once we recieved it, it was more like a shake than a smothie.  Overall, we are unlikely to return here. Sorry, luvies. Xx

Small mum and pop business that's been in the east valley for over 25 years.  The price and meal portions have been on point. Aside from their usual menu, they also offer "Specials" for the day.  Service is prompt, and warm... Yes, with the aloha vibe. Food? Let's just say we have yet to eat something we do not like! ^_^  Just remember, it's very busy during lunch and most dinner hours. So be patient if you are in there round those times. Alooooooha!   Xx

It started out as a 4 star due to the dining room being a bit warm. However, Our server quickly adjusted the temperature to our comfort level! ^_^ Khap Khun Ka  Food was delish!  Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive.  Music was proper volume. We appreciated the fact we were able to have a conversation without yelling to be heard.   A mum and pop shoppe near old town Gilbert.  Sure! The decor is not swanky or mod. But the quality of food, portion of food, the price you are charged, and warm service... I'll take that anytime over a really awesome decor with mediocre service, and over priced dishes! :)  We'll be returning soon!

This spot came highly recommended by a work colleague. Am not much of a breakfast person but we gave it a go anyway. This review is for February 2013.  Saturday, round 9'sh, table for two. First time at The Farmhouse.  The waitlist was a bit loooong. We waited approximately 35 minutes til we were seated. Once we were seated, our server was MIA for 20 minutes. We were bout to leave when someone finally "checked" on us. The lady apologises for much delayed service. Instead of passing us unto another server, she immediately took our order. She also gave us one of their famous cinni-bun[sp], and apologised one more time before disappearing to the kitchen. Approx 15 mins later, our breakfast was served. We had the pancake with eggs and bacon, and the omelette.  Cinni-bun[sp] ... was warm and buttery. Quite rich. Pancake with eggs and bacon ... cooked as I had requested it Omelette ... was a good, but a lil bit much on the cheese. (They did offer to make another one. But we were starving. So we passed on the offer.)  Overall, food was quite nice, and reminds me of home cooked american breakfast. :) The service was a bit on the slow side, but that one lady took quite good care of us once she realised we have yet to be assisted. She took our order, and served it as well.  If you like hearty American home made breakfast feel ... arrive early at The Farmhouse. They are worth giving a go! ^_^  ::TO DATE:: We have been back several times since February 2013. We still enjoy their grub!

Our first time here, and wished that we have reviewed what fellow Yelpers had to say.  First of, we called for the Monsoon Service two weeks ago. They said it will be completed within 45mins.  We got there within 20mins of our phone call. Upon check in, we were given an hour to complete the Monsoon Service. Ok we thought, still not bad. We dropped it off, and went about our day.  We returned an hour and thirty minutes. Still not completed. The bloke on the front desk said that they are finishing up. Another hour thirteen minutes later ... Bloody finally! It's completed. Needless to say, we were not pleased (at all) for being misquoted time of completion -- from 45 mins to 2 hours and 43 mins! We were quite patient and understanding. We want Big O Tires complete a great job on  our car.  -- Oil change ... completed. BUT that sticker reminder they usually place on your windshield is missing  -- Wiper blades were changed. BUT wrong size on passenger side  -- 30 points inspection ... INCOMPLETE  We were quite disappointed. Nearly 3 hours of wait time and incomplete service. Great discount... thanks, but not thank you!

I had the pleasure of encountering a faculty that could care less bout their student. All the accolades this faculty received may have been warranted. But during on a one on one session ... this is not the case. Am glad that I've completed my studies here, and no longer have to deal with this inconsistent self-righteous faculty. *whew*  Unfortunately, a faculty like this person, ruins the rep of an ok to good city college.

We've had pleasant experience here. There are no reservations, however. ;( The price is competitive. Plenty of lanes available whenever we come to play, and lounge with our mates.  Front desk  ... cordial. Service (food) ... slow like molasses ;( Price (food) ... slightly pricey. Shoes, Lanes, & Ball ... it's well maintained, and plenty to choose from. No Smoking! *hurrah* Centrally located between us & our mates!  We'll do another round (or two) soon! Xx

I enjoy Bikram.  This studio is well kept. The staff and instructors are quite knowledgeable. To practice, it costs a pretty penny. Some people, however, will reason that it is but a small price to pay for better health. Am a student on a budget. Mum and Dad is not paying for my living expenses or uni... And Bikram.*lol*  Be warned, it does smell once you are in there. If you can by pass this, you might just find your zen, even if its only 90minutes out of your day. ;)  Xx

It started out pleasant until I had to ask the server to cook my food a lil longer as it is way under cook, and I asked for it well done.  She returned bout 25 mins later with a new dish. Unfortunately, it was still undercook. The middle was soggy and runny. After waiting patiently for nearly an hour for my food ... and my mates were already done eating their food... I was getting a bit pissy, but managed to remain cordial.  Instead of checking on my order, she was busy socialising and taking fotos with diners in another table. We were wondering if she was already off the clock, or on break, or something.  Finally, my food arrived. Yes, for the 3rd time! It was still undercook. I suggested to have the heat lower and leave the bloody thing just a little longer til it's browned. She raised her voice and was no longer cordial. In my younger days, I would have argued with her with regards to her sub-par and inconsistent service, and their food. The food was inedible for me after taking a bite or two. Finally I asked if I need to pay for the food I did not order? "Yep, coz you ate it!"  (apply improper customer service attitude) *hahaha* Madam slacker, I ate a portion. Finally, a 10% discount was applied after much "discussion."  We are so looking forwad to dining again at this IHOP location! NOT.IN.A.GOOGLE.YEARS! *faiiiiil*

We went for their dinner service. 12.99/ person.  The sweet treats were stale. The sushi section were not fresh either. Majority of their menu/dish were chicken. Our server only visited us twice - to bring water & the tab. And no. It was not busy. Their shrimp on ice tasted "fishy" and odd consistency. The beef broccoli was decent. :) The rest was simply too oily for us. For 12.99/person, we expected loads better service, and quality of food.  Xx

This was our second visit. The first visit was ok. However, today was just non plus.  If we could give zero star, we would. This is for very rude service by ANNA, and overcharging.  We ordered burritos with no cheese. Anna was very rude when I reminded her we ordered our burritos without cheese. She also condescendingly reminded us that "All burritos comes with cheese inside, and that YOU need to tell me no cheese!" I explained to her that we did infact ordered the Burritos without cheese prior to her adding cheese to our orders. And we reminded her again as she dropped a handful of cheese on the burritos. She then rolled her eyes unapologetically, and moved on without asking what do we want with our Burritos.  With that being said, I asked the cashier to please put pico, lettuce, cilantro, and guacamole with our order because ANNA is not interested in providing us decent customer service. The cashier apologised, and the cashier asked ANNA to help us out. She then told the cashier to charge us for asking for some lettuce and pico as it was a side salad. WTF?! Sincerely?  We did not order a side salad. We simply would like the garnishings that she did not want to add on our burritos. My mates and myself at this point have had it with her deplorable attitude. So, instead of stooping to her very poor attitude, we decided to pay the over-charge, and leave.  We also work in a service industry. Anna's rudeness to customers, and retaliation by over-charging us is simply unacceptable! If she cannot provide decent customer service to church goers like us, perhaps she needs to find a position who tolerates her rudeness., and away from public service. She sincerely is giving us service workers a very bad reputation!  The food was on the salty side for us, but with a little lemon/lime it was good. ^_^ The price was average to slightly pricey. The amount of food was a bit on the skimpy side for the price they charge.  Given our recent experience with Cafe Rio, we are not returning here again ... unless  there is a Zombie apocalypse! *lol*  Xx

30 July 2013  Great customer service by the CSR (terminal 4 North) on the graveyard/swing shift! Courteous, kept us updated, and offered refreshing ice cold water! A necessity during 100 degree. Thanks v much! Xx  Price for RT service was less expensive than a taxi one-way.

Was over at Lollicup not too long ago. My apologies, but I cannot seem to stop myself from comparing one from the other.  I like Lollicup as well - friendly and prompt service. And it is even closer to my flat.  But the bottom line is this ...Boba Tea House offer us bobaholics a large variety of flaves than Lollicup. Period. Hence I do not mind driving quite a ways to get my boba fix! ^_^

May 2013  Cashier was friendly.   Prices were spot on!  Food was a little on the oily side. :( We ordered bulkogi beef well done. Food we received was still too pink. We send it back to be cook to our liking and as how we ordered it. We did not have any issue with the food being sent back. The cashier followed up after.  Wait if or our food was a bit long ... 25 mins. We get that it's being cooked to order so we did not mind waiting.  Will return again.

This review is for the Optical Dept only.  We've been  members of Costco since 1994.  And today, we've encountered the rudest Licensed Optician to date.   We got a ticket. We waited patiently for 30 minutes to be helped. We noticed that people that came AFTER us were and have been helped before us. So I sent my niece to inquire if they're using the ticket systeme to help customers. The Licensed Optician said were next and dismissed my niece.  We're new to glasses or getting glasses. So we asked the License Optician Karen. Our inquiries were greeted with rude and condescending comments, loaded with such a negative attitude... "What? You didn't ask your eye doctor?!" We explained that we were seen by the eye doctor mid 2015. She rolled her eyes, and continued on using unfamiliar terminologies. So we asked. After all, we are paying customers, and we were proper customers. She didn't quite like that we inquired. Deep sighs, sarcasms, and more eye rolling followed suite.  We will never use the Optical Department again. I wonder if the reason we were treated like shit is because we were the only brown skin at that time? Very odd indeed.

Been here a handful of times. It gets a bit crowded, but most climbers here are friendly and will belay for you when needed.   Main drawback for us was it was slightly more expensive than the other we also frequent. However, we appreciate the fact that the orientation/quick training guide is facilitated by a knowledgeable climber in person rather than watching it on the tube.  I've recommended this spot to my mates... and they enjoy it too!

Stayed here for my Bday. It is my kind of spot!  Pros: -non smoking -gym/spa was newer and well kept -our room was a full on suite with a lovely large bath tub -complementary water -centrally located -digging the decor! :) -proper concierge is a plus! -free Wi-Fi  Cons: -have to walk through Cosmopolitan to get to Vdara most of the time (not really a Con per se ... but after having a bit too much of adult bevies, and swear you are done for the evenin' or mornin' and Cosmopolitan does have lounges with lovely drinks ... let's face it ... I had a bit of a challenging time getting back to our suite! *hahaha*) -Resort Fee was not included! *boo*  Verdict: Will stay again, and will recommend to fellow non smoker and non gambler, especially! :)

Consistently great service, food, and timely delivery! :)  We have been ordering from King Wok for nearly a year now. So far we are quite pleased!  We also order from other spots, but this mum and pop shop have been the most consistent with the quality of food, delivery, and customer service.  We have recommended this place to our mates, work colleagues, and lived ones. For the most part, they are happy with the service King Wok has provided.

Food arrived 1 hour and 45 mins late.  We called 2x  Last call we made, they hung up.  They refused to refund and take the food back.  Never buying from this place again.   Been a loyal customer since 2012. It's not the first time  this kind of bad service  happened.  If you're reading this, any recommendation for a Chinese restaurant that provides consistently good service, and timely delivery?

It is our fourth time enjoying some of baked pancake goodness here at JP Pancake. This place is not for carb-conscious, or healthnuts. However, if you are just like us who enjoys healthy living five days a week, and the remaining two days we eat like normal american diet which includes treats like this (or kronuts)! ^_^  Price is average.  Portion for the most part will fill a couple of diners in their "free what you fancy eating" day.  Location is fairly easy to spot. Service is warm and friendly.  We'll definitely pop by here again! *nom nom nom*

The place itself is pretty cozy and inviting. The price ... It's decent. You can get a meal complete with water, chips and salsa, and a main dish for approximately 20.00 (tax and tip included).  We dined on a Monday. The bar area was busy, the main dining area had bout ten diners (excluding my party).   We were seated promptly, chips and salsa was served timely as well... And it just went down hill from there! :/  Service was very sloooow! It seems that the restaurant was very short staffed. Our meals did not arrived for nearly 40 mins, and we waited another 20 mins for our tab. Once we received it, we hand to wait for another 20 mins for someone to help us pay our tab.

It's our second time here at StandUp Scottsdale.   The first time was not too memorable. The performer was not that funny, hence the crowd was not engaged.   Last nite was our second time... 6 mates looking for more than just your typical club/pub scene. We purchased our tix online seemlessly. Drinks were moderately priced for Scottsdale. The seating was more comfortable than the one in Tempe. The performers were funny, and it seems the format was a bit more laxed (which is brilliant, in our opinion)! All were funny, but Godfrey was hilarious! Hahaha.  Thank you for not imposing a two drink minimum. We still had a bit of libation, and snacks. We just don't appreciate when it's imposed. ^_^  The 9:30pm show went on to the wee hours of the next day. We were enjoying the show that much that we didn't mind it at all. Manager gave all attendees a comp tix for the "inconvenience." Thank you! But sincerely, it was not an in inconvenience at all.  The only thing we were not fond of was our server. She walks off in the middle bit of placing our orders. Other than that... We all had a jolly good time! ^_^  We'll make it our usual spot from here on. After all, we all could use a laugh after a week long of being cooped up in the office, no?

Consistent great customer service. Front end staff are cordial at the very least. Knowledgeable staff. Physical location is a bit of a drive for us. Hence only 4 Star. However, they offer other conveniences that other banks or CU we used to do business with. Fees are also minimal in contrast to the other financial institutions we used to bank with.  We like it here! ^_^

It's a hole in a wall... a mum and pop joint. Nothing fancy... limited car park. Patience... definitely bring it. No whiners please.  Service is prompt and  consistent too. Food? Well... what can we say? Consistently good!!! The price is fair. They even have lunch special.  It's too far from where we live... They don't deliver. *sad pandas*  But see you next lunch hour, Chanpen. ^_^

We splurged on this one. We have no idea what's the show is all about. It was a purchase made on impulse.  Let me just say we enjoyed all the Cirque de Soleil shows... with the exception of Cris Angel (spelling). Zarkana has its moments, but overall, it was quite enjoyable and entertaining. It started promptly, and we're encouraged to take photos long as we don't use flash. We're happy to obliged.  The show was approximately 2 hours long.   Seats were comfy, and plush.  The attendants were warm and knowledgeable. .. and chipper.  The price... well, that's another story. Hahaha. ^_^

Second time ordering.  First time, our order took an hour and ten minutes to arrived. The promised time was 45mins. That's 30mins pass due.  Second time, we ordered and promised a delivery time of 5:45 to 5:55. Order was placed at 4:56. It is now 6:28. Our order is yet to arrived. What the bloody hell?! )=|  This will be our last time ordering from this place!!!!

We received correspondence from this spot. Thank you for taking your time.  We did verify the number we provided to GrubHub. It was a working number. We also rang the spot when the promise delivery time was not fulfilled to follow up with our order. All we were told was "It's on the way!" With a bit of an annoyed and hurried tone from the lady we spoke with. Hung up without letting us interject with our inquiry.  We love supporting mum and pop local shoppes. But we require proper service. One of them is keeping what was promised - timely delivery. Waiting for delivery of cold pizza, and appetizer for nearly two hours... Is not at all timely.

We stumbled upon BURGR by accident while perusing Miracle Mile after enjoying a show.  Here is the down low ... -Place is massive,  well decorated, and welcoming -The price caught us a bit off guard (then again, we are in Las Vegas, and dining in one of Ramsay's joint ... but after late dindin, we agreed it was well worth it! -Service was cordial-friendly -Our food arrived timely -Our Ticket/Tab was a bit too slow. We had to wave on one of the servers to finally bring it to us.  Overall, we had a lovely time. Yes. We are returning again! :)

We're craving some Mexican Food. Cantina Laredo was a lil far from where we were, so we opted for Gecko Grille.  We ordered Nachos Supreme Asada. We love that the chips were thin and flavourful, and crunchy. However, the meat were overcooked, rubbery, and salty. For the price, it was not worth it.  The place was a mess when we arrived. There were wet seats, tables were dirty, and music was a lil loud to carry a normal conversation.  Our server was pleasant, a lil slow, but pleasant.  Overall, It's just ok for us.

We were seated promptly. The menu was simple and easy to read. Prices ... Some were slightly pricey. We liked the ambience. Retro fun! ^_^ Service was prompt, and those who helped us seemed knowledgeable of their offerings.  We ordered tacos and chimis. Oh and salad as well. We liked the fact that it's not processed. However, it seems to lack flavour. It's either salty, spicey, or tangy.   Their chips were yummy, and like the fact that Darth Vader kept us company! Lol  Give this spot a go! ^_^

It's my first check in, but our fourth time here! ^_^  It's a local mum and pop shoppe we like to frequent now the we've found donut shoppe whose doughnuts are not overly sweet.  Mornings are super busy, but service is warm and timely.   We love the old fashion sugar donuts, and their boba teas are perfect for warm and sunny day, like today.  Price is comparable to other donut shoppes in the area. But we get better service here.

We have been ordering here for a while. So far, the customer service is amazing! The food as well, of course! ^_^  Our last order consisted of shrimp fried rice, and lemon chicken. We sincerely appreciate that there were lovely plump whole deveined shrimps! They were well cooked! The fried rice was not greasy. The lemon chicken was sautéed in flavourful pinch of salt and pepper, fresh green and red bell peppers, and onions. The chicken was tender and moist. We were delighted that it was not battered and deep fried, and swimming in sauce. Also love that there were layers of flavours.  ***Wok Up, please continue being consistent with serving better Asian cuisine, and maintaining great customer service! We appreciate you!***  We will definitely continue enjoying Wok Up's food!   They also offer gluten-free dishes! Brilliant, ain't it?

They have been consistent with service and  food we order. We have been happy, and pleased... Until one of their employees got out order wrong. They were apologetic, did not charge us, and they even gave us free appetizer.   Mind you, this is a mum and pop shoppe. If you are expecting 5 star service on a 4 star restaurant... Please dine elsewhere. But if you want to actually taste the different flavours/ingredients in the food other than sweet, or salty... Give this mum and pop shoppe a go.  Have recommended this spot to my colleagues. Most have been repeat diners for 3 years. ;)  Cheers!  Xx

We have been dining here for about a handful of years. More often than not, this mum and pop shoppe's been consistent with delivering great customer service...

This place came highly recommended by my foodie mates! And today, we finally had the chance to give their offerings a go!   We arrived at the drive through, and they offer, basically, deep fried chicken fingers. 1.09/small battered deep fried chicken finger.  The drive through intercom was muffled and loud. We had to repeat ourselves 4 times to order our food, 2 times to correct out order. We also told the food clerk that it's our first time here.  After we placed our order, we moved forward to pay at the window. The cashier looked as if we were bothering her with something. No greeting, no smile, and was not helpful at all when we asked her (what the order taker did not answer) what comes with the 3 chicken fingers. Our inquiry was, AGAIN, ignored and left unanswered.  After paying, we picked up our orders. We asked, AGAIN, what comes with the 3 chicken fingers. The response we got was "Thank you, have a nice day!" We thanked the girl, but we asked the same question, AGAIN: what comes with the 3 chicken fingers. "Ketchup!" She said.   5 minutes later, we arrived at the flat. Opened our much anticipated recommended grub! We ordered 6 piece combo meal, 3 piece combo meal, and my 3  pieces of chicken fingers with Ketchup. There was 3 pieces of napkins for all orders, and one of their special sauce in a small container.  Overall, SERVICE was subpar based on our experience going through the drive through. FOOD, were greasy, fries were soggy and not thoroughly cooked, the *only* seasoning we all could taste was salt. Oh, and the bread was plain white bread... Toasted only on one side.  What a let down - pricey, bland, soggy, and most of all, bad bad service!

Growing up near awesome boba joints in California and New York, I can be a little too particular. Ok, I can be down right boba-zilla! (Gosh! Is that even a word? lol)  I ordered the Thai Tea with organic AZ Honey, and honey boba. No sugar please, oh and only half of the half & half. Catherine was brave enough to help this Lil Boba-zilla of a Nana. Catherine handled me with a smile. Well done, Cat! ^_^  I received my yummy fave boba drink. I noticed it starts foaming. Uh oh. (Yes. I was shaking my head as I stare at it.) Then Cat swooped right in and offer to remake my drink properly after apologising. WTF?! Proper customer service at a Boba Haus? Naaaah!? Sincerely?! Outstanding, Cat! YOU bloody rock, luv!  By the time I've concluded this review, I have managed to invite a huge tribe to come check this spot out... if not today, this weekend!!! And in two hours, me, my mates, and family are returning to this very same spot for more refreshing treats!   ***  Welcome to the neighbourhood, Fat Straw!  Welcome indeed. ^_^ ***

Our 1st time here. Holy Jebus!!! This market place is huge!  Plenty of spots for everyone to park their car. It's clean, and well lit.  The store is massive! It's clean. The aisles are well marked, and merchandise are well organised.  We appreciate the varieties of merchandise offerings. They have walls of sauces, home goods, amazing meet selections, produce, cookwares, and they even offer vegetarian options along the frozen aisle.  They have plenty of registers or tills to assist you upon checkout.   Overall, we are pleased with our initial shopping experience!
