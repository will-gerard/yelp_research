For those that haven't heard, Payton Curry has taken over Welcome Diner April through May on Sun, Mon, Tues, and First Fridays. Get there... now. Payton is known for pushing limits and incorporating fresh, local ingredients. The menu will likely change every week, if not every night, so I'm not sure if my recap will help all that much, but here goes.  The neighborhood is sketchy, the place is tiny, and the accommodations are "rustic", so if you're all into the Scottsdale scene or flashing your dough, don't bother. That being said, Shantal mentioned that being there made her feel like she was camping every night, and I have to admit the evening had a vacation feel to it... National Lampoon's style!  You can instantly tell that Payton is having a blast and it shows on his face and in the food. We were seated on a collection of old dining chairs at a makeshift table of 2x8s and construction horses in the middle of the front yard, with a candle to light our way... I knew it was going to be a sweet evening!  We started with the burrata that was lightly seasoned with truffle oil and cracked pepper. Unfortunately a lot of people are adding burrata to their menus and they have no idea that this fresh, creamy, delicate version is how it's truly meant to be. It was served with slices of toast that I expected to be the brick-hard version to which I've become accustomed. Imagine my surprise as I bit into a spongy, buttery slice of bread with just a crunch of the crust! Delicious.  The porcini foie gras terrine will scare those faint of heart, but it's amazing and the pear butter adds this velvety, sweet flavor that just makes it unforgettable. I wasn't a fan of the pate', but it was a combination of pickle, horseradish, and mustard flavors with chunks in the loaf... all things I can personally only handle in moderation individually and generally dislike, so it was exactly as described. The mains arrived and the Sonoma lamb sugo proved to be an interesting choice. It's not something you would eat on a regular basis, but I'm so glad I got to try it. The shreds of lamb meat were piled on top of a bowl of hearty fettuccine with perfectly cooked chickpeas and dollops of cream that muted any gaminess of the meat. Then you would get a bite of golden raisin to kick in a touch of sweetness; pretty cool combination of flavors and textures without being over the top.  Perhaps the biggest surprise of the night was the bowl of Bolognese that was planted in front of us, it blew me away and I have no idea why!! Payton, what's your secret with something so simple? Dessert followed with apple pie that could've been much tastier if it were warmed with a scoop of ice cream, but all was rescued with a huge chunk of bread pudding that puts my mother's recipe to shame (and it was served warmed with a scoop of ice cream :).   All in all, we had a wonderful night with fabulous food and fun friends and we didn't want the night to end. If you want a hint of adventure, get to Welcome Diner before the end of May... seriously... National Lampoon's style.  ps: It's BYOB!

The first time I tried this place I had no desire to return. However, over the years my family has coaxed me to go back several times and I have to admit, I'm glad they have. Had several tasty dishes here, but I can only specifically recommend the Thai Omelette... it's damn good... that is all.

I had heard great things about Spinato's, but never thought much about it. However, I was lucky enough to try some of their sausage pizza at the Local First Fall Festival and was blown away. Here they were, amidst chefs from various posh restaurants, outside of Duck and Decanter of all places and when I walked away from the festival I couldn't stop thinking about that incredible pizza!   I have since found that this location delivers to my place (dangerous discovery) and have fought hard to limit my indulgences. But if you like pizza with a thin, yet not crispy, crust with fresh ingredients and just enough grease to meld the flavors, you need to give Spinato's a try.

Recently ordered Spinato's again and just had to update to 5 stars... as much as I've always loved NYPD, I have to admit that this really is the best pizza I've had in the valley. It's not fair to compare the two, as they're totally different styles, but it's just so good. And they're local. Can't beat it!

So glad to have found this place hidden in a dive of a strip mall (aren't all  places in strip malls in Phx?). Hey, it allowed me to finally find Joe's Grotto too.  Dragon Palace provides quick, thorough, and friendly service. Very well packaged to-go orders that keep you from having sauce spill out all over your car. I've tried a few dishes and found that they can sometimes be a bit bland, but overall it's quality Chinese food. I happen to be addicted to the Mu Shu Pork. I was surprised they wrap the crepes before packaging, but it really seems to allow the flavors to blend together and they're just plain good.  I had been really disappointed with not being able to find a decent Chinese takeout place in Phoenix and Dragon Palace is just what the doctor ordered!

I'm a slacker and didn't get any reservations in to the local restaurants I've been wanting to try for Arizona Restaurant Week. However, when I gathered some friends to decide on a night out, Roy's still had plenty of openings (not necessarily a good sign, but they have a large dining area). Now, I've been to Roy's a few times and they never disappoint, but I've been VERY spoiled with local, fresh, non-chain faire lately, so I wasn't expecting much.  The choices for restaurant week were quite good. I started with the scallops, which were a bit bland, but good quality scallops and veggies. I also had a Cucumber Basil Collins... the cucumber basil combination is my current favorite for cocktails and this held up quite well. My petite filet showed up and everyone commented "oh, it's so cute!" That's code for "it's tiny!!" However small the steak, the poblano mashed potatoes had a balanced kick, the red wine sauce brought the filet up a notch, and I was perfectly satisfied. What was supremely killer was the flourless chocolate souffle. I had remembered that Roy's does dessert like nobody's business, so I ordered a little glass of extraordinary port (Justin's Obtuse; I was excited to see it on-hand!) and went into fully food-induced orgasm mode. One touch from the fork and the souffle exploded with a flood of chocolate goodness, which went perfectly with the ice cream and drizzle of berry sauce... only to be elevated by the richness of the port.  Food aside, what impressed me most about Roy's was the service. Every member of the staff greeted us as we entered and departed. The host graciously offered to have the bar tab transferred to the table when our entire party arrived. Our waitress was full of personality and provided incredibly detailed descriptions of each dish. And when dinner wrapped up, they even offered to have our valet cards validated and our cars brought around front for us... nothing tops off a beautiful evening like having your car waiting out front when you finally decide to meander outside.  While I'm a confessed food snob, we'll certainly visit Roy's again... and it may become a special treat for happy hour now that the weather is nice; the cocktails are top-notch, their specials are a good deal, and the patio at Desert Ridge looks divine!

I had forgotten how much I loved this place.   Used to hang out here for happy hour a lot in the day, but moved offices and almost forgot it existed.  But how could I? Great, cheap drink specials. Yummy eats. And there's nothing better than taking over the top floor with friends to play pool or shuffle-board. And service is top-notch; there's always a member of the staff waiting patiently behind the upstairs bar, just watching for anyone who needs a refill.  Admittedly, I had to dock a star because the food isn't as high-quality as it used to be, but it still beats the typical bar food any day.

Ugh... after going to spring training games at Phx Muni and Peoria, I had high hopes for Scottsdale. But, unfortunately, it's stereotypically Scottsdale. Maybe it's just the draw of weekend games, but we had to fight for our tiny spots on the lawn. The entire time we were surrounded by fake chicks dressed like they were going clubbin' and guys picking up on anything that moved. I thought Spring Training games were supposed to involve baseball?!

Been to Kazbar a few times... I love the concept, the decor, and the amazing selection of wines. My only issue is that it's in old town, has somehow remained trendy, and therefore tends to attract that pretentious, "the world revolves around me" crowd. But I can't fault the place for that... it is a business, after all.  This month (July) Kazbar has 1/2-priced Arizona wines every Thursday with live jazz. I had to stop in and was amazed at the full page of selections they had... I mean, you can't get Caduceus' Judith just anywhere... and Callaghan's Claire's is one of my favorites!   The guy at the door was a bit slow and I was disappointed that the couches and many tables were all reserved. It's a packed winebar, don't make paying customers stand while plenty of comfy seating is available, just waiting for the "golden children."  However, after cracking a $100 bottle and a 20-minute wait, we were able to get seated. The band was quite entertaining and we were impressed with the friendly, knowledgeable service that rounded out the evening. It is refreshing to see a place like this supporting the local juice!

Love, Love, LOVE the zereshk pollo! I'm not very knowledgeable about Persian dishes, but the saffron rice with barberries (zereshk) is an incredible combination of flavors.   The portions are much larger than they appear in the pictures on the menu... the plates are enormous. Be prepared for leftovers.

Can I give it 3.5 stars? Okay, I'm givin' it 4! I've been to Bobby's twice now and been really pleased with both the food and the ambiance. We've had very attentive service as well. But I've decided the kicker is to take advantage of specials.   For example, the first time I went was for AZ Restaurant Week where I was able to try a prix fixe menu for a reasonable price. Last night I had my best friend from Kindergarten visiting who is a food disector... she literally takes food apart and re-distributes everything before taking the most finicky little bites. So I knew I needed a menu that was good, but had lots of variety with few surprises. I digress; we were ALL over that happy hour. Here's the thing, you get half-priced apps from 4-7pm along with the drinks specials. Since we needed to sit for a while and catch up,  we got a couple glasses of wine and dug in.   The rundown:  Crab Cake and lobster ravioli - And I quote "as if crab cake and lobster ravioli on the same plate isn't good enough, they go the extra mile and top it with delicate lil shrimpies!" (she got a second order later)  Eggplant rolletin - the thinnest, most tender eggplant, rolled up like a lil taquito with ricotta inside. (again, cause for a second order)  Escargot burgougne - I figured my first exposure to escargot might as well have them stuffed in beloved mushrooms. I could give or take this one, it was chewy and burned my tongue... but the garlic/wine/butter-oil they were swimming in went great with the bread.  Butternut squash raviolis - The stars of the evening, in my opinion... light, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. They have a hint of what I think I identified as clove or possibly nutmeg inside and are topped with a few diced tomatoes in a light, buttery sauce with a bit of sage. If I could ask for anything, it would be to have ordered a wine that paired better with them... love those lil guys!  Dessert - Not on happy hour, but we needed stretch out the stay. Cheesecake was generously portioned (too big, really) but good. I had the dessert special that I can't remember the name of, but it was ice cream over strawberries, topped with an Italian custard... very tasty!  It came to about $40 for each of us, but we stayed for hours and ate more than any normal human beings because that's what we do together... 6 dishes, desserts, and 4 glasses of wine for $80 isn't bad at all. While I love the food, the place always seems pretty empty, and the normal prices are just a bit steep... again, I want to give it 3.5 stars, but ya'll must try the squash!!!

Really excited to have a new place to dine near home. Went tonight and I wasn't very hungry and really wasn't in the mood for jack, but had plans to meet a friend. So I perused their expansive menu and saw about 10 things I thought might be really good! Decided to try something off-the-wall with the thai omelette; meat, peas, carrots, and glass noddles inside egg? Why not!?  It was really quite good and did a great job of bringing me out my funk without trying to bowl me over.  The place was a small strip-mall location, but it was busy when there wasn't anyone in sight at the places around it. I'm not a Thai food connousieur, so I can't vouch for the authenticity. All I know is I had a good meal for a reasonable price and I'll go to bed happy knowing that I have a new dinner option nearby.

Bertha's has original, tasty sandwich creations. The veggies, meats, and cheeses are always fresh and flavorful. However, the star is the incredible breads baked in this local cafe. The cookie is a great melt-in-your-mouth treat. The owner likes to make the asparagus with a spicy kick; I like it, but it is a little unusual, so one should be prepared.

Just a quick update... Bertha's was unable to renew their lease and will be shut down for a month or two while they move to a new location. I think they are supposed to relocate by the end of June somewhere near Indian School and 32nd St, so just make sure to call before "popping in" (I heard a new cafe may be going in at Bertha's current location).

I've been to Saddle Ranch twice, once for weekend brunch/lunch and once for a night out.   Brunch/Lunch: HUGE portions... I mean HUGE! I had an ahi tuna wrap (I know, totally non-western) and it was decent; a little tastless, but fresh and filling. I also tried the garlic mashed taters and they were good, but not anything to rave about. The service was awful, but the manager made up for it by bringing our entire table free shots and enormous plates of dessert. The shots were basically flavored water, but the desserts were moist, rich brownies with lots of ice cream.  Friday night: The place was packed with an odd mix in the crowd. You had sports fans, mixed with tourists, mixed with silicone. It was so busy and we had such a large group (friend's birthday) that I was able to tune out the urge to people watch. Didn't eat much, but the wait staff was much more attentive. What's odd is that we got free shots again (at 2 separate tables from different waiters) and free dessert. I noticed a trend that most of the wait staff was delivering trays of shots to the various tables. Our table of women were also approached by the bull-ride conductor (is that what you would call him?) and told that we'd get free rides if we could muster up the courage to hop on the saddle.  Conclusion: I'm not sure how this place makes as much money as it portrays because of all the freebies. However, it could be a brilliant scheme to keep everyone there, drinking for hours, and keeping up the image that it's THE place to party.

Oh... my... lord.   Went to Savor Scottsdale's Notorious P.I.G. event at Digestif and can't even put into words how great everything was. All the credit does not go to Payton Curry, as each course was from a different chef and a different part of the same pig, but WOW. Chef Curry was certainly the entertainment for the evening, with personality that just doesn't quit. And having him gush to our table about his Easter Sunday menu, beginning with carrot soup, ending with carrot cake, and everything rabbit in the middle, I will certainly be visiting Digestif more often. We've also seen him at the farmer's market, picking out the freshest produce he can find... it's not just a schpeel, this guy is serious about utilizing local ingredients.  Anyway, back to the pig. Every course was made to perfection, half of which I had never heard of before... and paired perfectly by Todd Bostock with Dos Cabezas wines. I could go on for pages, but suffice it to say that you all should support your local chefs and watch out for more great events from Savor Scottsdale, a non-profit organization working to put Scottsdale on the map as a culinary destination.  Props to Chef James Porter of Tapino, Chef Aaron May of Sol y Sombra, Chef Brandon Crouser of Atlas Bistro, and Chef Tracy Dempsey of Cowboy Ciao, et al. They can whip up the most amazing dishes from the most obscure ingredients. Did I mention the trotter salad or bacon ice cream?  http://thedish.freedomblogging.com/2009/04/27/photos-notorious-pig-dinner-at-digestif/6939/

I have been wanting to try this place for a while now and finally had the perfect excuse. The lovely patio made the perfect setting for a reunion brunch with old friends from out of town! A great wine list and awesomely spicy bloody mary's set us off on the right foot. We had to try the tempura-fried bacon with bourbon maple syrup... a friend's review had the batter as too thick, but a solid effort. However, I think it was perfect; had the whole doughnut appeal with the salty bacon surprise in the middle!  To counteract the fat intake, I ordered the salmon fume' (smoked salmon, cooked egg, shallots, cured lemon, caviar). Everything arrived in individual little piles on a wooden platter so anyone squeamish about any ingredients could just avoid them altogether. I, on the other hand, polished off every bite. It was all very fresh and light with great flavor.  The friends all really enjoyed their meals and I got kudos a-plenty for suggesting such a great place to meet. Even the toddler gave rave reviews, eating almost the entire plate of sour cream-hazelnut waffles with warm berry compote... he had the berry stains everywhere to prove it!

Tried Floyd's last night and was pretty impressed. The service was friendly, but a little odd... I couldn't tell you who our waitress was because we had 2 or 3 checking on us throughout the evening.   I ordered the meatloaf on a whim and it was quite tasty. It almost had a stuffing element to it, but was well seasoned and tender. The gravy it came with was delicious and the garlic mashed potatoes were very good. The veggies were fresh and cooked very well, leaving a bit of crunchiness while tender in the middle. The thing that stood out was a maple flavor on the veggies; not that they were drowning in syrup, it was just a hint of sweetness. I'm wondering if they use an apple-butter on them or something.  My friend ordered the stuffed chicken, which was a very generous portion for the price. She was thrown off at having the pasta on top of the chicken breast, but was very pleased with the flavors and quality of the dish.  They don't have their liquor license yet, so it was beer and wine only, but I enjoyed the petite syrah. Can't remember the label, but it had soft fruit upfront with a leather smokiness on the backend that paired well with the meatloaf (yes, I actually admitted to pairing wine with meatloaf). I look forward to returning to Floyd's to try some of their other dishes.

Checked this place out for AZ Restaurant Week because the menu they were offering sounded terrific. I felt a little guilty after finding out it was in Digestif's old location, but decided not to hold that against them. The service was very accommodating and the ambiance was great.   Onto the food... they brought out a terrific aoli for dipping bread; however, the bread plate only contained 2 little rolls and we were never offered any more. First course we shared both the calamaretti and caprese. We were a bit shocked to find the calamari coming out looking like a giant stuffed shell! It was tasty, but I expected more prosciutto than ricotta; the stuffing was basically a thin cream with bits of prosciutto and thyme for flavor. It certainly didn't pair well with the Cabernet, the thyme and tomatoes brought out much too much acid in the wine. The caprese was good, with excellent balsamic touches, but the tomato wasn't what I would consider ripe. Overall the first course was a nice presentation and tasted fine, but a disappointment from the descriptions.  Main course was the braised lamb shank/osso bucco. With 2 giant shanks, it looked fabulous. The meat was tender enough, but the flavors of the dish just weren't very good. Here I found myself staring at a decadent dish that tasted like mom's old pot-roast. The risotto underneath didn't even work well, but perhaps it was all caused by what I would consider a poorly executed wine sauce on the lamb and surrounding the dish. My friend had the Gamberri Angelotti Alla Carbonera that looked like seafood in a bowl of cream. Very little pasta, but she said the flavors were good.  Dessert was a standard lava cake that was presented very beautifully. The best part was likely the light strawberry sauce provided on the plate to complement the rich chocolate. All in all, the experience was exactly what Restaurant Week is meant for; try out various dishes at local restaurants for a great price and determine which ones you'd want to go back to with a fuller wallet. With so many other great restaurants out there offering amazing flavors and freshness, this one just didn't make my cut.

I've been procrastinating on this review because I have yet to get to Petite Maison for anything other than their late night staff meal. However, I cannot wait any longer, as I have never had anything but an exceptional experience here. Having known Chef James & Wendy from their previous restaurant (Tapino), I expected Petite Maison to be top-notch, but this location is so welcoming and cozy.  They could go cheap on the late night staff meals and the red cup specials, but they don't; the quality of the flavors are unbelievable. I've had a decadent foie gras mac & cheese, poutine with an over-the-top fried egg, and most recently, the most supreme BBQ beef piled on polenta. Each of these dishes were consumed on different occasions and each for just $10. The quality never fails and the staff is always friendly and accommodating. They even kept my leftovers warm the other night until I was ready to pack it in & head out (without me asking).

I had a kink in my neck for days and was busy running errands when I passed by Elements and saw the "Walk -Ins Welcome" sign. It was like the clouds parted and I could hear violins playing. I walked in and was able to see an experienced masseuse within about 20 min. Now, I've had hundreds of massages in my lifetime, but I have to rank Chad right up at the top. He focused exactly where I needed and adjusted the pressure for me perfectly throughout the massage. It's kind of bizarre to have a spa atmosphere in the middle of a strip mall, but it was exactly what I needed and way better than expected.  I generally get massages through my chiropractor, so they're covered by benefits and I'm only out-of-pocket my co-pay. To that extent, it hurt the wallet to buy a package at this place, but I just couldn't resist. Chad provided a fantastic massage!

Everyone had raved about this place and it was on a long list of joints to check out. I'm now extremely angry I didn't try it sooner. It took a while to warm up to the ambiance, but as soon as Sun came out with our food it was like we were welcomed guests in her home. She showed us the best flavor combinations and even dished out plates for us to share. And the food... the flavors were varied and rich, and the dishes marked spicy actually had serious heat. My sister-in-law, who used to live in Korea, even commented at how much the food brought back great memories.  Speaking of the food, the Haemul Pajeon was a hit with all of us; it's huge, with the perfect crisp on the outside and hearty chunks of seafood in a tender pancake/omelette (whatever you want to call it). With a touch of sauce it is delightful. You can tell there is so much care taken in the preparation of these dishes, even the green tea ice cream mochi was served sliced, with a beautiful drizzle of subtle sauce (aloe, maybe?) and whipped cream. I'm totally sold on another strip mall treasure.

I can't believe I forgot to write a review for FnB, I feel like I've been singing their praises since I first stepped foot into that welcoming atmosphere! First let me begin with how much of a joy it is just to meet Pavle Millic; he is by far the friendliest and most doting personality I have ever encountered. The menu is an interesting read, nothing that I would ever consider creating myself, but it all sounds intriguing.   My first visit to FnB was with a group of foodie/wino friends and many of them had visited before. I let them recommend their favorites and then went and ordered the only items they didn't have covered, so we could try just about everything on the menu. I am SO glad I did, as I would've missed out on the best trout I have ever had... scratch that, probably the best fish I have ever had as a whole. I cannot begin to describe the symphony of flavors that Charleen has created in this trout dish, just try it... whether you like trout or not, just try it. That's not to say I wasn't impressed with the braised leeks in mozzarella with mustard bread crumbs and a fried egg on top... delish. The crispy rock shrimp and salads are also terrific.  FnB also has an all-Arizona wine list which is why I was eager to support this place, but it goes so far beyond the locavore/locapour effort. Overall, dining at FnB is a wonderful experience with a comfortable atmosphere, amazing aromas, top-notch staff, and incredible flavors. I've stopped in several times just for a drink or dessert and it feels like I'm walking in to visit family. Someday I'll make it in for the late night specials... they tempt me every time!

REALLY impressed with this nail salon. From the moment I walked in the door it was apparent that Ali prides herself in developing a relationship with all her clients and by the time I walked out I felt like I had made a new friend. As a family owned and operated business, it is a very welcoming atmosphere and really comfortable and clean. I just got my mani/pedi yesterday, so I can't speak to the longevity, but all high quality products were used and they look great! Additionally, all of the technicians (Ali, husband, and daughter) took extra time to truly massage everyone's feet, legs, hands, and arms; so many times at other places it's just a superficial rub. There are a lot of nail salons in the area, but I would highly recommend passing the others by and heading straight to Ali's.  PS. If you request french tips, don't freak out if she paints halfway down your nail in an uneven way. She goes back with remover and a brush to shape the tips beautifully; it's kind of a unique technique.

I think this was probably the first time I actually had tapas and I loved it. Since I didn't know much about the menu, I left a lot of the ordering up to my dinner companion. Everything we had was quite good and the prices on bottles of wine weren't completely unreasonable.   There was one outstanding dish that thankfully ended the entrees; Canelones tradicionales de cerdo y hígado de pato con salsa bechamel. In case you can't translate that, it was pork and foie gras cannellonis with bechamel sauce and sliced black truffles on top. It was to DIE for and not nearly as heavy as the description may lead you to believe. We even managed to have just enough room for some traditional flan with a light mango sorbet. Perfecto!  Our server was great, very personable and helpful and only gave us her personal recommendations when we asked. It's a pet peeve of mine when servers say "oh, that's really good" about every single thing you order or they try to get you to order something in which you have zero interest. The only reason this isn't a 5 star is because it was a trendy Vegas spot on the weekend and so it was packed and loud (even at 10:30pm when we got there). The prices are high, but it is Vegas; I'm actually surprised we didn't end up paying more.

Is it a dive? Yes. Is it the best I've ever had? No. But it's close to home, it's cheap, and if you venture out of the norm, it's pretty damn good. I am in love with the soft/fried egg noodle shrimp (#19) I've had it done both soft and fried and they were both absolutely stellar. The flavor in the sauce, the crunch of the veggies, and the added black pepper on top just make this dish so much more than any bowl of Pho for me.
