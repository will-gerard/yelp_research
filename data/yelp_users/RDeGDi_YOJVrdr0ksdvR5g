I agree with Lindsay B. I cannot say enough good things about this place. Dr Curran as always been supportive understanding and helped us so much from nicu stays to er visits. This office and everyone in it has been amazing. Our son is not circumcised and it has never come up except to make sure we do not mess with it, We LOVE the nurse practitioner. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE her. She is always so sweet and always sees us last minute. I could not imagine any other Dr office caring for our son. Every doctor has been amazing and we have seen them all for so many different reasons. They take time to explain the whys and hows and have decent supportive conversations wit me about controversial topics. I will say it again WE LOVE THIS PLACE. Even the front desk ladies are always nice.

I'm always disappointed when we come here I don't know why we keep trying. Just get takeout. I paid early to be able to leave with my toddler if I need too. They took my money and never came back. No drinks ignored my request for napkins. Asked for a booth the host brought me to a table.

Rough. Went in for an oil change. 42 is expensive but didn't have a wait. Now I know why. They drained my oil and then told me it would be 78 had to get crappy oil and still pay in the 70s after being visibly upset and arguing about it. Do yourself a favor and skip this place and go to the big o next door. They operate with much higher integrity. We will not be back what a ripoff the dealership is cheaper.

I always hear about this place form my friends and I  have even eaten here once before maybe 6 years ago. Finally went back last night and wow was it good. The appetizers were wonderful. The meat was tender and delicious. We will definitely be going back very soon.   Get the sliders and the mushroom gravy schnitzel. You will not be disappointed.

I used to love this place maybe it's better for dinner. But lunch was not good. The food was not good. I got four onion rings with my meal the sandwich was bland the burger was slathered in a1 sauce. Last time we went was like this. I thought it was a fluke bad day. The server took 20 minutes to get our drink order we had to ask other people repeatedly for stuff. Just very disappointing all together.

Im not sure of we went on an off day but the service was slow. The food was mediocre at best. I ordered the crab pastry with hollandaise. It was imitation and the hollandaise was obviously a powder. I could taste the butter flavored margarine on the potatoes. we will.not be going back. $30 for two people plus tip. Such a waste. Also the tables and high chairs were gross I had to wipe them down.

We love this place, i always plan to review but never do. The service is wonderful. The food is great. If you are new to Vietnamese food ask the waiter or waitress for advise on what to eat and how. They have a bunch of great new things. The fried rice is wonderful so go eat there (we will probably see you :P)

There just wasn't a lot of flavor to these. We were so bummed as they were part of my mothers day present.

Very very good. The Peking duck was awesome. The whitefish was delicious. All around a very good Chinese meal. Best we have had in a long time. We eat dimsum here a lot and very much enjoy it but dinner was wonderful. Will be back for sure!!

Food was great. Staff was great. Chairs were comfy. Price was good. Great lunch. Clint was great even helped me clean up my toddlers spilt drink. I will definitely be back. Glad the rain detoured us to this parking lot or we might have missed this place.

I'm not sure what to say. I have never seen a tortilla with no grill marks. The food is very expensive and not very good. In fact our cochjnita pibil was mostly fat. The beans were very sweet and no salsa in sight. Still cost almost $50. For two people. It's cheaper to buy churros at Disney land. Won't be back for sure. Don't waste your money. Lost of better places to eat on this strip.

I agree with Eric L. Blew me away too. It's so good. The sashimi is something I dream about now and the Yaki udon chicken. Also the staff is very accommodating. I have been there multiple times now and it's always great.

Delicious food and great service. Decor was nice and staff was friendly. The food was very good and so many choices. It was a little pricy but all natural and worth it. We will be back for sure. The drink selection was nice as well.
