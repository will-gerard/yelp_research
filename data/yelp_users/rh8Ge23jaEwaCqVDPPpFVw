This review is only for what I needed. I Googled  suede cleaning, they come up. NOT. They don't do that. Slight false advertising. I drove a long way, so no need to come back. I really don't know about their other services. Just do what you say you do.

I went to get few pairs of pants shortened the other day and they came out perfectly and besides the great results, Dennis was absolutely amazing and understood exactly what I wanted and delivered. I definitely recommend going here for any alterations anyone may need!!

My 5th time here, waited till I tried enough times, so I made an accurate review. One word. Amazing. Nothing fancy, but I have been sorely disappointed at some "fancy" places. Brulee is awesome. Today I just got bacon chz burger. Delicious. Best burger place around.

Tried yet again, but they are not here. Disappointed, because there are not enough hot dog places around.

My daughter had an appointment at the salon in the same plaza, so when I looked up Chinese on yelp, this came up. She was craving chicken egg rolls, and they have them so....I ordered by phone 4 items, and was told 10 minutes. That should have told me. But.... Hot and sour soup: not spicy, no vinegar, no shrimp or pork, no bamboo shoots. Tasted like oily chicken stock, (I bet it coagulates by morning), and had soggy cabbage (...what?...). I took out all the cabbage, added siracha and rice vinegar and could eat it. . Chicken egg rolls have just that. Chicken and a little cabbage. No more veggies or flavors. Fried rice: No peas, teenytiny bits of carrots. Miniscule egg. Cream cheese puffs aren't bad, but maybe more than 1/8tsp each would be great. Orange chicken: Not too bad. All sweet, though. No heat. We are there in the plaza 3/week, but will never go back. I did, however, call and give them my opinion. I hope they run with it. It was 100% honest and spot on.
