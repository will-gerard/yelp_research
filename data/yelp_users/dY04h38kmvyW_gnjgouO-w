Scramble is our go to neighborhood breakfast place. The food is fresh and tasty with real ingredients and almost always delivers as sometimes the rosemary potatoes are a hit or miss or the cinnamon roll may not be full cooked through depending on how backed up the kitchen is which brings me to my next point. Arrive early(!) or be prepared to wait a while just like any other breakfast place.   I usually get the dollar buttermilk pancakes (serving of 3) with a side of rosemary potatoes but have tried the veggie omelet, biscuits and gravy, cinnamon roll & French toast. All tasted amazing and are sure to please.   Staff is very friendly and courteous no matter how busy they are.

This location went downhill fast with all their recent changes. Seems like a bunch of kids running the place that weren't trained correctly. Ordered a Mac and cheese in a bread bowl to go. Got to the vehicle and decided to check the bag and found just a regular Mac and cheese with no bread bowl (which I paid extra for.) Went back inside and the told the food prep person about the missing bread bowl and they sold "oh that's what in a bread bowl meant"...um duh? Also asked for a chicken salad sandwich with no tomato and a chicken poppyseed salad with no blueberries so of course when I got home I discovered tomato on my sandwich and blueberries on my salad, my bad for not checking those too before leaving I guess. Lesson learned, If you order something with a substitution or special request make sure you repeat yourself a bunch of times and double check your order before leaving if it's to go because it's most likely going to be wrong.

Amazing! Don't let the strip mall deter you since most amazing little gems are usually hidden in strip malls it seems.   I had the Beach House burger which was super favorable. The pico mixed with smoked mozzarella and green chili. Wow.. Had the sweet potato tots and BBQ chips which were both tasty.   Friends ordered the French Toast fries which weren't my thing (don't like French toast in the first place, I know I'm weird) but he was in love.   We will definitely be back as I want to try their tacos and carnival corn.

Ok in my review you will see the use of "great flavor" over and over because that was about all that came to mind.   This is a great mom and pop place where you feel like family. One of the owners talked with our table like he knew us for years even though he just met us. The salsa tastes fresh and flavorful and chips were nice and crisp, very much home made. I ordered the soft taco Carne Asada plate with rice and beans. Rice and beans tasted very authentic with great flavor. Carne Asada wasn't dried out like most places and had a nice flavor as well.   We'll definitely be back!

Sat at the bar on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. Nice place with a live cover band playing 90s hits and a friendly bartender.  Food had great flavor and I highly recommend the panuchos and sweet corn appetizers.

Location - 5 stars. I chose San Norterra for it's location. I wanted something that was close to my friends and places I regularly visit but also somewhere quiet and peaceful.   Ambiance - 3 stars. For the most part this is really a very quiet and peaceful place to live minus the usual noisy neighbors that like to abuse the 24 hour pool by discussing the personal & intimate aspects of their life at 1 in the morning loud enough for all the apartments by the pool to hear (seriously people? I didn't want to hear that about you!). There's also the issue of the auto-closing apartment front doors which probably should have had a mechanism added to the spring so that when the door does close it doesn't slam shut with enough force to rattle the whole side of the building. One would think that people would be courteous to those living around them and not let their door slam every time they open it but hey guess that's just wishful thinking.  Amenities - 3 1/2 stars. The 24 hour heated pool/spa is nice  and big with 2 gas fire pits, numerous tv's under the patio and a large bar area that includes a sink. I know they label this as an entertaining space so it would've been nice if they had put a grill in the pool area so you could cook for those you are entertaining, but I guess walking down the sidewalk a little ways will have to do. There's a volleyball area as well by the pool, lots of lounge chairs, gazebos and top 40 mix of music that is played. The gym is full of brand new equipment that is hardly ever used and I never see more than 3 people in there at a time. There is a community center with another fire pit and lots of seating as well. There's a small playground in the far East side of the complex too. There should be another playground by the pool but that's just my opinion. I would've given them a higher rating if they had a dog run area and tennis courts.  Apartment - 4 stars. I chose the top floor pool view 2 bedroom apartment. The vinyl wood floors are a beautiful dark stain and compliment the cabinets and granite counters nicely. I really like how they put the granite counters in the bathrooms as well instead of that cheap looking marble that you see everywhere else. Carpet is a little nicer but still basic apartment carpet. Kitchen - I want to have a talk with the person who picked the stove. Who's genius idea was it to put a large burner on the back of the cooktop and the smallest burner on the front? Large pots/pans can't even fit correctly on the back burner..grr anyway, I wish they would've done an under-mount sink since they did granite as it would've looked much more luxurious and that the pullout drawers had stronger supports but overall it's a very nice kitchen with lots of storage. There is a laundry room right off the kitchen with a full sized washer and dryer too. Bathrooms - lots of storage again, wish the master would've had a tiny bit bigger shower but it gets the job done. Bedrooms - nicely size (I have a 4 poster canopy king sized bed with a full dresser and a hope chest in the master and my daughter has a full sized bed, dresser and a ton of toys in her room) with decent sized walk-in closets. I'm also renting a storage space ($80) which was surprisingly big and a garage ($140) which has room for a small car and some storage space as well.   Management - they're very friendly and quick to resolve any problems/questions that pop up.   Yes for the price I'm paying (almost $1400) I could afford a nice sized house in the area but overall I enjoy my maintenance free living with my pool/mountain views as well as some friendly neighbors and recommend this place to a lot of people.

This place tastes amazing!! I ordered the #1 - The burger was flavorful and was topped with fresh veggies and nicely grilled onions caramelized to perfection. I normally don't eat a whole burger anywhere I go but devoured the entire thing.  The French fries tasted great as well. Nice and crisp and not overly oily like some places. We will definitely be back!

Do you know what I hate? When people write a review but don't take any pictures of what they're actually reviewing. Don't worry I took pictures of everything I ate :)  Don't let the exterior fool you this place is home to some yummy BBQ and friendly service. I knew from previous reviews that the sandwiches were on the small side so I ordered 2 (one pig and one chicken) plus a mac and cheese and fries...I skipped lunch and everything sounded amazing and had a fat kid moment leave me alone ;) Sandwiches were $3 a piece and sides/drinks were $1 a piece as previously mentioned by other Yelpers.   Food came out promptly and I started on the chicken sandwich first which was flavorable then came the pork which tasted yummy as well. I put their BBQ sauce on both just because, it tasted nice and sweet but not too sweet. The roll was nice and soft too not like the hard ones that hurt your teeth biting into them. Mac and cheese tasted homemade not the boxed version that these other reviewers must be used to and the fries were almost shoestring style and crispy. After eating all that I can definitely tell you that 1 sandwich will do the trick of filling you up, don't overdo it!  They have a sign posted that you find another BBQ place that is better to please still visit them. I think that says something along the lines that they aren't claiming to be the best there is cause there is definitely better out there but if you're in the neighborhood do check them out!

Good food, strong drinks, good specials, lots of tvs, 2 pool tables, shuffle board table and misted patios. What else more do you want from a sports bar? :)

This review is based on cocktails and decor only.   Came in for a few drinks on Monday night while we were figuring out dinner plans. Had heard great things that were supposed to come from this new place so we were pretty excited.   First impressions of the decor was that the place looked amazing. Rich colors, county accents with leather and wrought iron, looked great!   After staring at the drink menu for a while trying to figure out what in the world all these fancy words meant (thank you Google dictionary) our party of 4 ordered the Green Acres, 2 Solera Gomez's and the bartender's Blue Ribbon drink (rummer time(?)). Our excitement disappeared as soon as we took our first sips. Now I've had some bad drinks, usually it's the bartender pouring too heavy, but these just tasted awful ingredient wise. They didn't blend well at all and just seemed like someone was trying to be too artsy and out there. We all looked at each other, said ok chug em down and let's go somewhere else cause it was obvious we didn't have the palates that this place was concocting for.  Hopefully their cocktails will be switched up regularly to something more edible or we may come back for just wine and to sit on the patio to enjoy some appetizers..or we could just go to Postinos which always impresses.
