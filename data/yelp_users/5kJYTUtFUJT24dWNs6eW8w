Ritos, where the menu was too complicated when it contained both tacos and burros, so they've ditched the tacos, for now. It's just a shack of a house in Garfield, with no signage and nowhere to sit. Who cares? It's muy good.  Rito's has its own very authentic homey style of chile sauces. You either love it, or not. Personally I love it. Most people seem to dig the green chile, but I get the same thing every time: Red Mixed (red chile and beans) Burro. This thing will explode on you. No matter how chewy and elastic the delicious tortilla is, that chile is coming out of there whenever it feels like it. For a while, I took to just turning it into a tortilla stew on the provided paper plate. But I have accepted the challenge of keeping it in burro form and am working toward the goal of containing the chile within the burro throughout the whole process. I'll update to 5 stars once I master this, or once the delicious tacos return, whichever comes first.  Harder to get to now that I've moved out of the hood, but well worth the trip each time.

I've just remembered another benefit of Rito's!  Hadn't been in months, but whilst dragging a Rito's virgin (my friend John) for his first visit, we lucked into a rare taco day. YAY!  But that's not the benefit... the new upside is what happened to my downside. I ate about 2000 calories and spent the rest of the day getting rid of about 5000 calories. Went in fast, came out faster!  Eat delicious food - lose weight. Nothing better.

I AM AN IDIOT I've spent years bitching about the lack of even a DECENT chinese place near our house (Baja Arcadia). I kept looking to Scottsdale for somewhere to eat. We've got just about everything else, from real-deal taco shacks, to excellent Pho, to fine dining. But no real Chinese food. I was looking the wrong way. Up til recently, I would drive all the way to Wong's Place in Tempe just for the real stuff.   THE CHINESE CULTURAL CENTER I shop regularly at what used to be Ranch99, that oasis in the desert that makes you feel like you've been transported to the Hell that is Riverside CA. I've tried numerous restaurants in the mall over the years and always been disappointed. The one I never managed to try is the Szechwan Palace. I expected it to be just another Gringonese disaster. Man was I wrong. We eat out maybe once or twice a week, and we've hit this place at least once a week since we found it a few months ago.   SZECHWAN PALACE I love you, Palace. Dan Dan Noodles. Spice. Yu Xiang dishes. We've been when it's packed full of high maintenance Chinese businessmen and when we're one of 4 tables in the place. Every time, the tiny kitchen and the wonderful servers keep their smiles in place and just give you that little shake of the head that says: "Solly, it clazy tonight!" Even though this place pleases real Chinese food lovers, there's plenty of stuff to keep my Jewish mother-in-law happy too ("happy" is a relative term).   THINGS I LOVE   - Wan Fu: the worst white wine in the world (that I love)   - Dan Dan Noodles with extra hot chile   - Yu Xiang Shrimp   - Mongolian Beef with real beef, not that over-marinated rubbery crap   - Fresh veggies that still have some color and snap to them   - Incredibly spicy Water-boiled dishes   - Any of their soups  Wong's thick-skinned pot stickers are still the best, but everything else at the Palace rules.   BOTTOM LINE It's hard for me to imagine a bad review being credible unless some key person was missing or they were ridiculously understaffed and got slammed. We've been there for one of those nights though, and it was still very good, once we eventually got served. As others have said: get the real menu as you walk in. Otherwise, you'll get the Panda Express version. You'll also have to grab chopsticks. Other than that, just enjoy!

The 5 Stars let you know where I stand. Uniquely awesome sammiches on crazy fresh Umbrian-style bread. You cannot go wrong.  So just a tip: keep calling and checking to see if one of the following is the market sammich that day.   - crumbled sausage and melted mozzarella   - pulled pork   - pulled lamb   If it is one of the above, in that order, drop whatever you're doing and get there as fast as you can. Also, do not ignore the market focaccia. Even if it just looks like a pile of veggies on a sheet pan pizza, it is fantastic.

Jewish girls in Chinese dresses serving Japanese food. If that isn't a recipe for confusion, I don't know what is.  Too bad, really. Because when they first opened up, they had a real Japanese chef who had a respectable career and was trying to make actual Japanese cuisine. He naturally didn't last long in this 1980s pseudo-asian theme park environment. Remember when the owner used to intermittently drop the screens down and fire up the THX system and play movie trailers from last year? The chefs couldn't even see their hands. Now that's setting your priorities!  Happy hour and late night patio is this place's saving grace (for others, not for me). But it's so far from Japanese food/sushi as to make them guilty of false advertising. See my Stingray review for a similar take on the food experience. If you FAIL rice, you FAIL sushi.

When you want a seriously unique and, how to say it... "modern" looking cake to impress the esthetically inclined, Tammie Coe.  When you want the secret to the best Sliders ever, Tammie Coe (well... MJ) Slider Buns.  Coupled with access to MJ Breads, this is a local gem.

I love JT's. The food is outstanding. The wings  are uber alles. That guy Omar hates your guts. He hates my guts too. He hates everyone's guts. It's part of the charm.  Go there, but don't take my fucking seat. I'm hungry.

Dear Gilbert, Don't take this the wrong way, but I've never had a reason to come visit you. I'm sure I've skimmed your edges, or skirted just around you many times in the past. Sometimes maybe even on purpose. Sorry. You've probably seen me drive by and thought - "There goes that prick again. Who does he think he is?" But you're miles away. We don't have any friends inside you. You lacked a compelling draw to pull us out of our mid-town cocoon. Until now. So I hope we can put the past behind us and shed our preconceptions about each other and just move on with our relationship. So...  LIBERTY MARKET What a refreshing, rewarding surprise. A hip, family-friendly, easy-going place to get great food and beverages in a clean, clever setting. The website hinted at its authenticity, but how many times does that fail you??  On the street, it's a nifty setting that harkens back to an Americana that I grew up with in the midwest: water tower, mid-century neon diner signage, real brick, public sidewalks intended for human use, trees, etc. But the building itself is a clean juxtaposition of modern worked into a cool old (by PHX standards) building. Old brick meets steel beams and open space. Everything is functional, not just there to look cool. From the structurally relevant beams to the authentic wood-fired oven, it all serves a real purpose.  We (me, wife and 9mo old daughter) chose our seats at the pizza oven counter and clamped on our baby's magical floaty chair. We immediately struck up a rapport with James, at the oven, and learned that almost everyone we encountered, other than customers, were his family and friends. That's pretty cool. We've now been several times and the food has never let us down. In fact, we've been drawn back almost weekly on our little pilgrimage to keep exploring the menu. I don't see a James Beard award in the future, unless they give one for consistently delicious, honest comfort food. But we're all happy to drive out of our way for a visit that puts a smile on our faces every time.  THAT CHRISTIAN THING Now, to address something that really shouldn't matter, but often does to many people: "The Christian Thing". Due to the amount of interest in Agritopia and its "Bible-based design", I think most people know going in that this is a Joe Johnston place (Joe's Farm Grill, Real BBQ and now LM) and he's pretty open about his beliefs. I'm sure to the surprise of many who would avoid establishments that clearly identify as one religion or another, there is nothing in-your-face or proselytizing or patronizing about this place's pretty public Christian identity. If anything, the experience speaks volumes about the honesty of their description of their beliefs on the Liberty Market website. Yes, when you know about it going into it, you feel the presence of their faith. But all in a good way.  I almost feel like bringing this aspect of it up was unnecessary, but at the same time, I think it needed to be brought up; simply because of how many people I've talked to who immediately jumped on that angle - "oh, the Bible Thumper enclave in Gilbert", or "sounds kinda Stepford-ish", etc. If you just wandered in without any background info I think your takeaway would just be - "Now that was a friendly group of people and a great meal."  Oh, and check out the bathrooms. It's fun.   So for what it is: friendly, sincere, fresh, honest, well-thought out, comfy, delicious, consistent, complete and did I mention friendly? - 5 stars.

Just about as good as it gets for a fun day with the little ones. Expansive grassy areas to run around. A city playground with equipment for all ages. Nice little snacks shops with decent food and good ice cream. A fun carousel. Pleasant staff. Great little ramadas for picnics and birthday parties.  But most of all... chugga chugga chugga chugga WOO WOOOOO! TRAINS!  The under-construction Model Railroad Exhibit is super cool too, and free for the whole first year.  Weekends in this beautiful weather (November) are VERY busy. Weekdays are a breeze though.

The downtown outpost of Crazy Jim's has never disappointed. it's hard to label the type of food at this place. But it's good for groups, because you can choose from among various mediterranean items, burgers, pizza and more. Kind of a diner with a Greek slant.  It's not fancy, just solid delicious food. The pitas rule, whatever you stuff in them. Their gyro meat is flavorful, tender and not dried out. Surprisingly, the made to order pizzas are really good too. A thicker crust than I enjoy anywhere else, but damn good.  My favorite thing is their steak meat on a pizza. It's like chewing up an italian beef sammich with red sauce, and spitting it onto a pizza stone. That probably doesn't sound as good as it tastes.  If you haven't explored the menu yet, you should.

Nobu's food doesn't challenge you, it thrills you. You already know about the accolades and awards that extend far beyond this valley. So let's get down to the do's and dont's.  Do:   - sit at the counter, at least half the time.   - beg for oxtail stew. get on the "oxtail stew call list". if they run out, find and kill an ox. chop off his butt.   - say yes to the little, live, flash-fried river crabs.   - try the omakase menu at least once.   - order a bottle of the Jozen Mizu No Gotoshi sake. it's floral and dry and perfect. (we mow through 2 or 3, but we're drunks)   - order the white fish carpaccio. garlic has waited 1000s of years for this dish to be created.   - be nice to Chantal. she is a cool chick.   - marvel at how skinny Jeff the Chef is.   - work harder to make more money to come back to sea saw.   Don't:   - come here for sushi rolls.   - tell your party that it's "right up there with Stingray".   - bring someone who wants sake bombers.   - bring a large group. it's optimized for couples and small groups.   - be allergic to anything, cuz god knows what's in there.   - look at the prices. ever. when the check comes, cover the top with your other hand and just sign. tell chantal to add the tip in.   - be afraid to ask the chefs what they're doing and why. learn.   Rarely is innovative food so comforting. We always leave happy and less wealthy. If a place can consistently do that for you and keep you coming back, it's onto something.

quick update and adding some cam-phone pics, if they turned out in the low light...  It has been awhile since I've been blessed with the time or cash to partake of Sea Saw. Wow. Amazing. And they're mixing things up.    FOOD-WISE: I like to start with a Sparkling Cosmo (believe it or not, i'm straight), then we nurse liquid heaven: Jouzen Mizu no Gotoshi sake. It's like flower water from heaven, that makes your pants fall off later.  New stuff! They started making a fried focaccia bread, similar to the bread that accompanies the White Fish Carpacio, but it's fluffy and golden. This is for making sammiches! And the first sandwich out the door is Softshell Crab. If you're thinking "oh-great-greasy-softshell-crab-roll-at crappy-sushi-joint", STOP right there. It's heaven. Like something you'd get in New Orleans at a 5-star French joint. Light, but crunchy and savory. Not greasy at all. Hints of spicy aioli and mild red onion. Yes, mild red onion.  The big eye tuna sashimi always seems better than the last time. And a special hirame sashimi with a citrus zest - chili paste (yuzu kosho) topper was the perfect ender.  More sandwiches and a late-night menu are on the way. Part of that late night menu will be steamed buns (think momofuku) stuffed with savories like pork belly and short ribs.    OTHER CHANGES: Probably gonna be closed a day or two (sun and/or mon) soon, but adding some late-night offerings as mentioned above.  Indefinitely, no move across the street into the weird no man's land along the canal.  All this is hearsay at this point, but it sounds promising as it was coming from Jeff and Nobu. We can't wait!

I think I've easily eaten at DeFalco's 1000 times. I used to work literally next door to their old location. While I was baking brownies, they were making my sammiches. One time, we scuffed up the picnic table that Gerry had just built for his employees breaks. I took about a week off cuz I heard there was a contract out on me. But the sammiches pulled me back in, and I apologized and ordered bologna.  After moving downtown and losing out on my sammiches, I started revisiting them in their new, expanded location on Scottsdale Rd. Same great people, same great honest food.  Here are my favorites:   * Boars Head Bologna, sliced thin on Italian roll with lettuce, mayo and swiss cheese   * Ham Cappy on Italian, lettuce, mayo, mustard and dofino   * Chicken Parm w/red sauce on wheat roll   * the weird salad with penne and peppers and salami chunks  And give their pizza dough a chance. It's my new favorite for making thin, bubbly pizzas on a stone at home.  Please Tony, keep it in the family. Pass it on.

Remember when Caffe Boa was right on Mill, next to Red Lantern and Long Wong's? Remember when they were doing inventive, handmade pastas with fresh sauces and always had great specials? Remember the variety of flavors and the attention to detail? REMEMBER THE AGNOLOTTI?? There was nothing like it in Tempe at the time.  Yeah, it ain't that anymore. Every red sauce tastes like Ketchup and melted margarine. Every food object tastes like Sysco. I swear there are still ice crystals in the shrimp.   It's now a place for college kids to play grown-up date night, and former fans to hang their heads in sadness. I guess it serves its purpose as more of a college bar/practice restaurant. And its crowd is pleased with its easily-digested mediocrity. But I still lament the passing of the original, inspired Boa.  RIP Boa.

Blah, blah, blah.... best pizza in the world.... Almost silly for me to write a review about Chris Bianco's Pizzeria, but here goes....  Kari and I cook at home, for ourselves and for groups, 5 or 6 days a week unless we're traveling. And we often cook even when traveling. Doesn't leave us much time for going out to eat. That said, our little group hits Bianco EVERY week. It's a ritual. One night a week, we go early, drink wine, get a grilled cheese or cheese plate, and wait... sometimes waaaaaaaaaaait. Knowing them doesn't get you in faster; in fact it might be a detriment. But it never disappoints. You really just have to make a night of it.  Tips for making a night of it:   - come with people you know & like. a first date there can be brutal!   - bring layers: if the wait is long, the weather can change.   - plan on drinking and getting snacks next door at Bar Bianco.   - bring games or other distractions: we're the idiots that bring mexican train dominoes or dice every week.   - when Sue quotes you a time, it's accurate. live it.   - make friends with the people who are waiting near you. some of them are in our foodie circle now. it's like a micro-YELP at the picnic table.  We've eaten pizza all over the country, all over the world... NYC, SF, Italy, Des Moines, IA & St Joe, MI... wherever! To say that one and only one pizza is the "Best Pizza in the World" is kind of ridiculous. But if I had to pick only one, last pizza, it would be Chris' Special - whatever he wants to make that night.  (disclaimer: i'm not gonna order the special tonight, i usually let everyone else do that and eat theirs. i'll order exactly what i want: margherita w/mortadella, rosemary and garlic. but IF it were my last pizza ever... the special. and that night, the special would probably be: margherita w/mortadella, rosemary and garlic).

How refreshing. A real gourmet mexican (yes, i said that) joint I can ride a bike to. Moving to South Scottsdale, from downtown, has been somewhat frustrating. But being this close to Los Somberos is a big help.  I first went several years ago when they were in a strip mall on S. Scottsdale Rd. Got dragged there by a couple local restaurant people who kept raving about it. Shockingly fucking spicy and delicious. One app had us hallucinating. Loved it.  Time passed and they opened up this great little house-style location further up the road. Apparently the chef/owner and his wife got divorced. She kept the place. I was worried. But she's making it work fantastically.    THINGS TO TRY:  steve the bartender's margaritas: you can actually taste the tequila, so call your favorite. i like the patron silver marg. many prefer the cadillac marg that has orange juice. bear in mind, when you are talking, steve is listening. he has ears like a bat. if you don't want him to hear you saying something embarrassing about yourself, don't say it.   shrimp fundido: white cheese melted over sauteed fajita-style veggies and big fresh-tasting shrimp. great with corn or flour tortillas.   chips: pretty good. the salsas are a little mild for my taste. not bland, they have plenty of tart and sweetness. just wish they were rounded out a little more.   smoked chicken tacos: only ask for this when it's already the special. they'll try to accommodate when it isn't the special, but it will pale. when it's a legit special, they use nicely smoked, succulent dark meat. not that cubed up breast junk. i hate chicken breast. 5 stars if they add this to the daily menu.   carne asada tacos: consistently best i've had in PHX.   carnitas: a very generous, juicy, tender portion. they always happily hand over flour tortillas for me.   beef short rib: get this if you require lots of flavor. and by flavor, i mean rendered beef fat.   Lots of other stuff on the menu, and always at least one app and one dinner special. Enjoy!

I found the Rainforest Store to be very disappointing. I went in there with one goal: buy a mechanical parrot. Man, they make the mechanized parrot purchasing experience a nightmare.   Aside from the fact that the roof leaks and you're constantly in danger of being electrocuted, none of the staff seem at all versed in the features or options of the parrots. Are the roosts sold separately? How much for the whole tree? Can my parrot be "taught" new bawdy phrases to delight my friends?   And when you press them on the issue, they try to divert your attention away from your seemingly simple mission by plying you with alcohol and the shittiest microwaved snacks you can imagine. I mean, it seems like a nice gesture to give you something to nibble on while you wait for a Senior Parrot Specialist to come to your assistance and close the sale; but in the end you just end up wet, hammered, food poisoned and parrotless.  [ UPDATE: When checking my online banking later, I noticed they charged me for the food and drinks! I thought it was complimentary and they just wanted my credit card to put down a deposit on my birdie. What a racket. ]

Stingray is everything that is wrong with sushi in America. This place is just for young, dumb pretty things, and the douchebags that hunt them, to go for a quick bite before hitting 7 different clubs. It is a bastardization and dumbing down of the sushi experience that leaves 1000s of people walking away saying: "Yeah, I've had sushi. Sake bombers. Raw fish, big deal. It's fun."  Sushi isn't raw fish, it's a vinegared rice prepared in a specific manner to achieve perfect texture and flavor. That rice is then accompanied by various toppings, often raw fish. But you could eat an entire meal of real sushi and never touch raw fish.   Both times that I've fucked up and gone here, the sushi rice has been pathetic. Once so undercooked it was cracking in my teeth. The next, so mushy and over-sweetened it tasted like dessert.  Once, sat at the bar to try to get a little interaction with a "chef". I ask him what sashimi he recommends. His answer: "it all comes in fresh daily.... whatever." WRONG ANSWER, tall white doofus "chef"!  SR gets an extra star for being semi-cool looking for a rock n' roll sushi bar, and appearing to be clean, in the front anyway. And if you order the right stuff, it gives you something colorful to throw up later in the bathroom at Myst.  If you want real sushi: Hiro in Scottsdale, Shiro in PV, + multiple other venues, some I've yet to try but are getting good reports. Hell, even in a setting like the Metreon in SF, Sanraku is good Japanese. There seems to be a boom again, thankfully. But Ayako at the Biltmore will be missed for a very long time.  (I could copy/paste this same review for Zen32 and RA. Why retype almost exactly the same complaint?)

Butter Burger. For breakfast.  What part of that is ambiguous?  No reason to waste space saying what has already been said: best breakfast in town. Sure Matt is mean to me. And I don't go there enough. But my wife is 10 years younger than me and I have to maintain my svelte figure.

Helping a friend move the last remnants out of his swanky bachelor pad... and he turned me onto this gem. Apparently owned by the same people who do PHX City Grille, about which I've heard very mixed and non-exciting feedback.  BUT... I loved this place. Had instant charm. The rustic but clean and modernish decor, the friendly staff and attentive service had me before the food.  And a patio. Goddamit I want a patio like this in my neighborhood.  Knowing how much I love to cook and knowing what a foodie I am, Greggy seemed a little concerned that I would be underwhelmed.Then the dishes came out and that concern was put to rest.   Was my first trip, so I had to try the Posole as a benchmark - lean chunks of tasty pork, perfectly firm hominy. Nice thinnish broth. The cabbage and lime was a perfect topper. My culinary companion got a dish with a chicken stuffed blue corn tortilla, a buncha yummy stuff on top and topped with a fried egg (check my pics)!   Very good. Not knock your socks off gourmet or "muy autentico homemade at gramma's house". But quality, flavorful stuff. Lots of choices. Lots of specials. Excited to work my way through the menu.  If I lived in the area, I'd be a regular.

Unfortunately, we used to live in the hood (Coronado). Then we moved. Then Lisa G opened up. Then we wanted to move back to the hood! I can only imagine how awesome it would be to be able to walk there.  Keeping it simple: The Meatballs are big and magical. Get them on the bread as a Grinder. Love them so much we ordered 60 of them for a party. All gone!  The trio of sliders are inventive, fresh tasting and delicious.  The Juno, chicken sandwich with caramelized onions on fresh ciabatta, is crack.  We didn't know Lisa when we fell in love with the place. But we know her now because we love her food. She is a wonderful and funny person. But even if she were a raging psychotic bitch, I'd keep coming back ;-)

With Wade Moises at the helm, there was no better real, high-end Italian cuisine in the Valley. Marcellino's is quite good as well, but not necessarily better. Inventive, fresh and authentic. The setting is a bit over-the-top-North Scottsdale, but beautifully executed. Eating on the patio there can be heavenly. The long drive home, less so. That drive being further frustrated by the consistently best martinis in the Valley. You have to watch yourself, cuz they go down smooth.  But with Wade leaving, I fear for the future of Sassi. This is a potential blessing, in that his new place will be in downtown Phoenix, leaving Sassi to find a competent replacement (who won't have the former exec in his backyard). And it means Wade's amazing handmade pastas will be closer to my belly.  But it remains to be seen if they can find the right replacement. Tall order to fill. Best of luck, Sassi!

Dick's has that special something - the allure of the secret spot, your proximity to food coaxed by open flame, the forced intimacy, the darkness on the edge of visibility... and booze.  It's the food of Richardson's within a speakeasy atmosphere. Quirky rustic  ambiance served with a meaty, habanero kick. Great for an adventurous early date where you want to see if the other person "gets it", and to "get some" later if they do get it. And of course, an old reliable that you suddenly perk up and remember when you think you've run out of options for a great casual meal.  Also, the private room/wine cellar is a great option for smallish family gatherings, company events and holiday parties. The reservation fee completely applies to the tab and the enivronment itself keeps the conversation moving.  Don't ever change Dick's! (does that need a comma somewhere?)

Finally. I have a neighborhood sushi joint in Snottsdale to regularize. I love Hiro and Shiro (particularly Hiro @ Shiro), but the drive is not always conducive to how I like my sushi: with a side, or ten, of LoudMouth Soup.  Went to Dozo last night with some fellow long-suffering Old Town diners. This is the real deal. Exact opposite of Stingray and RA. This is the kind of place where you are more apt to find a father and daughter eating together, rather than an old douche and some chick-for-hire that looks like she could be his daughter.   It's not gonna change your culinary world. But it's real sushi with an emphasis on good rice and fresh ingredients. So Dozo is now my place.   Notes: apparently korean run (update: chinese! the owners are from taiwan and they're super cool), i'm guessing you shouldn't  practice your japanese on them or you might just learn to say a lot of bad things in korean  they have okinawan beer  pretty good, and reasonable sake selection  lamb chops? seriously? they're great!

I'm hesitant to give 5 stars after 1 visit, but I have to. Eating at the counter facing into the kitchen afforded us a real look at how much care and attention is put into the food, even though it comes out at a great pace.  A chef named Cole manned the impressive wood-fired oven with ease and confidence, and all the while he and the other chef making all the salads took our questions and offered up useful information with a smile on their faces.  Rather than get into details on each dish, I posted pictures of most of what we ate. Can't wait to explore the whole menu and look forward to specials and new additions.  St Francis is a gem: a stylish modern bomb shelter of a place, serving up skillfully crafted comfort food. The neighborhood it's named after is lucky it landed where it did. Plus it would suck to name a restaurant "Campus Vista" or "Scary Place Where Carolina's Is".

LOL @ 1-star review. That's hilarious, really.  Cafe Bink seems to be the much more approachable little sister of Binkley's. It's situated right along Tom Darlington (Scottsdale Rd) just before you hit Cave Creek. Simple little strip mall location, with an interesting shade-sailed patio. A little close to the road noise, but great views to the West. This is a real new bistro menu, and from I've had so far, it's wonderfully executed.  SETTING Scenic, if you ignore the stripmall to the East. Carefree/Cave Creek is a different beast than it was 10 years ago, for better and for worse.  SERVICE Our amiable but ditsy server managed to get everything out in order, and with a smile.  FOOD Just look for the pictures from Ron B above. That's my review. Plus the 5 stars. Only thing I will say is: best frites in town. Wish they had a straight up Aioli. And the green dipping sauce was just "off" somehow for my taste. Otherwise... well I gave it 5 stars.  BOTTOM LINE If you get near it for some reason, check it out for lunch or dinner.

What a happy accident...  So work has me trapped in NoPhoSco (hah) most days. I'm in the land of strip mall chain eateries near Desert Ridge. My hopes for a good pizza joint were at low ebb. But then on a trip to Ace Hardware, I discovered Lorenzo's.   This is real NY pizza. Perfect thin crust, with a great simple sauce and light cheese. Great balance on the flavor. Not beat to death with oregano or sugar. Had reheated slices of cheese and sausage that were really good.  And they deliver to our store location, so gonna try a whole made-to-order pie soon. Yay :-)

Finally stopped by the 2 hippies taco shack and brought a 3-pack back to work. Glad I did, with some remarks. Just a little walk-in shed for take-out and some minimal seating in and out. Beautiful day, so the wait was nice.   I got a chicken, a green chile beef and a pork. All of the tacos have abundant fresh cabbage, whole pintos (!), rice and cheese. But also plenty of meat. The tortillas are fresh and chewy and just the right thickness. No Carolina's here, but pretty good.  The chicken, unfortunately, is grilled, chopped chicken breast. I'm not a fan of that, but if you are, you would likely dig it. I like tender flavorful dark meat. Be cool if dark was an option, but I doubt they're cooking whole chickens. Prolly just breasts. Ate about 2 bites.  The pork was very tender and flavorful. Lacked the crispy edges of a true carnitas-style. Maybe you get lucky sometimes and catch some edges. I ate the whole thing and enjoyed every bite.  The green chile beef had delicious, lean chunks of tender beef. Unlike any green chile I've had. More vinegary, like a Southern pork shoulder. Lacked any punch, although the girl said the green was spicier than the red...? Was pretty tasty, but I really didn't feel like I was eating Mexican food.  I didn't get a burro, but since the fillings were the same, I'm pretty sure it's just more of the same, in a different shape.  I would try the red chile next time, and skip the chicken. Wanted to try the fish, but it's not fried. I like my fish tacos like I like my hippie chicks: hot and crunchy.  The food is more of a 3, but 4 stars for being there, being cool, being fresh tasting. And 4 or 5 for the value - I think myself and another light eater could split the 3-pack, making lunch about $2.25!   Ultimately, this is to Mexican Food what Pita Jungle is to Mediterranean/Middle Eastern. It's really not Mexican, but it is tasty. Like Cali beach food. I wish Yelp could do "half stars". Solid 3.5. But I round up because that's how I roll.

Guess I'm the first... brace yourself.... I'm feelin chatty.  Café Monarch is exactly what we've been looking for in Old Town. I don't know if there is a term for what this place is... kinda bistro, kinda café, kinda semi-private dining room: a castro privé? a bafé? Whatever it is, it feels like home.  THE PLACE The Monarch resides in a small, charming building with its own lot. The style is rustic, cozy and clean modern at the same time. A well-equipped, open chef's kitchen greets you on the left as you enter. There are a few tables inside, tucked into niches. There is one very clean and beautifully done bathroom. The design/decor is impeccable and creative. You can tell how much thought and detail went into the space. There is nothing about it that says "turn-key restaurant operation". And best of all this time of year, a fantastic patio, candle-lit, dark and surrounded by great plantings. There is no way I would refuse the patio, unless soft-ball sized hail was in the forecast.   HOW IT WORKS (based on our first visit) We had some idea what to expect: the place is an extension of the man, the chef/owner - Chris. Whatever he has decided to purchase, is what's for dinner. Just an oral menu. He tells you what he's got on hand and runs it past you. I expect, if you had some special needs, or even objections, he could easily offer up alternatives. Everything sounded great to everyone in our party, so he just started bringing stuff out at a leisurely pace. L-e-i-s-u-r-e-l-y. Which was exactly what we wanted. We were in no rush. You shouldn't be for an experience like this. The pace is like a large family meal in Europe. Prepare to relax and enjoy each course on its own.  An important note: it's BYOB for wine&beer, which we love. If you know what you like to drink, BYOB is a joy. There are numerous wine shops near Old Town to grab something on the way.   THE FOOD It was excellent. Everything fresh. Hearty, layered flavors. Generous portions. Expertly prepared, but with the welcome rough edges of a gourmet meal at someone's home. Although I guess it varies daily, here is roughly what we had:   - a hummus salad(?) loaded with good stuff served with hearty, crunchy hearth crackers.   - warm, baked goat cheese surrounded by sauteed grapes(!) and greens with rustic bruschetta, crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle.   - some sort of chunky beef soup, with mediterranean/moroccon tones - a meal in itself.   - a GIANT rack of grilled lamb. giant. seems like colorado lamb, due to the size of the ribs and the tenderloin and the pleasant gaminess. 6 huge chops. nicely balanced between sweet and savory, not some horrible overpowering chutney. personally, i like a more herby, garlic, salty approach with no sauce. but it was awesome.   - dessert? maybe? i was way into the wine by then. i always skip dessert. i think gelatos and strawberries.   IS IT FOR YOU? Hopefully! But I could see how Café Monarch is not for everyone. If you're generally fussy, or antsy or uncomfortable if you're not being ushered from activity to activity, stay away. If you are excessively picky and have trouble finding something you like even on a large menu, stay away. If you like Olive Garden pasta, are sad about losing Bennigan's or if french fries are your favorite French food, stay away. Although I bet he makes some bitchen french fries.  I hope for your sake, it's for you. But if it doesn't sound like your type of experience, I wouldn't try to force yourself into it. There's an Outback nearby that's got a beeper with your name on it.   IMPORTANT NOTES  - do not come for "a quick bite" - this will be your evening (or your morning i guess).   - again, BYOB. bring plenty.    - currently, there is lunch service on weekdays, and breakfast/brunch on weekends, dinner is only Friday & Saturday. not sure if there is a closed day.   - no cheesecake factory menu of 1000s here, you're eating what Chris is making.   - call ahead, or you may arrive to be greeted by a "Sorry, we're off catering!" sign.   I'll be back, and update as needed!

Wow. Did brunch today, as opposed to dinner from the previous review.  Outstanding. 3 little waffles with fresh berries and a lemon-pistachio butter(?). Best waffles I've ever had. Light and crispy on the outside. And not just "fluffy" on the inside. More unique - almost like a popover texture in the middle. Not overly sweet, just the crispy, moist waffles with natural sweetness from the berries and a handmade syrup from fruit.  Then a whole nother course: scrambled eggs on top of melting gouda, next to toast with pesto and artichoke hearts, bacon and chicken breast stuffed with sausage.  Either one of these courses could have been my whole brunch. But I couldn't resist eating both. Thank god we rode bikes there and back, and then rode again later to dinner with friends in the hood.  And great news! Smokehouse Sunday is theoretically starting next Sunday at 11am. (for future reference: this review is from Oct 2008)

2 visits. 2 very good experiences. More visits to come, for sure. I had been warned off by some people, but then my brother was in town from NYC and raved about it. He is spoiled for food and is not easily impressed. Maybe things were bumpy when they opened? But from our experiences so far, they've got it worked out.  It's a pretty interesting Bistro-style menu, with the expected Steak Frites and Mussels and the like. But they've also got stuff like Chicken-fried Sweetbreads and Escargot Cassoulet. Pretty adventurous for the middle of Old Dooshtown Snottsdale.   THINGS WE'VE TRIED Fried Green Tomatoes Green tomatoes, almost too perfectly battered in a grainy breading. Too perfect, like they look like they came out of a bag of frozen fried green tomatoes. Like fried zucchini at a sports bar. BUT, they are topped with a generous helping of lump crab meat in a spicy light cream sauce. I prefer my fried green tomatoes kinda messy and pan sauteed, but with all the bitching, I've ordered them twice and love them.  Brasserie Burger Perfectly medium-rare coarse ground juicy beef, on a brioche bun. Excellent.  Pork Cheeks Rich and creamy pork cheeks with grits and greens, and pork rinds as an interesting added texture.  Frisée Salad Lardons (basically, bacon) and a delicious cream sauce over frisée with a poached egg on top. Rich, but great. Not overly salty.  Steak Frites A really nice, perfectly chewy perfectly cooked medium rare steak. Every bite edible. No gristle or inedible fat. A little thicker than a real French bistro steak. Accompanied by yummy frites - I assume double-fried with some duck fat involved.  French Onion Soup My buddy Dave got this on our man-date. Looked great. He said it was.  Shrimp with Grits See above.   SERVICE Whatever. Took our orders, served our food well. No hiccups.   Really looking forward to trying the Vietnamese sammich - bahn mi, among other things.   All in all, I think they're on the right track. Hopefully they can survive the Southbridge curse.   Nice that it's within bike riding distance for us too. Added to the wonderful Cafe Monarch, Old Town is gettin good :-)   w00t!

Worried about the decline at Fate? Worry no more. Johnny has opened Sens just down the street from Matt's Big B and in the same building as the future PastaBar.  This is everything that Fate hinted at with its wonderful small dish appetizers. But with more playfulness, higher quality ingredients and fantastic execution.  Sens is, I guess, Asian-Fusion tapas. It's meant for sharing, then ordering more of what you like the best. Those decisions are not always easy. The regular menu is pretty extensive, and there are exciting specials, like steamed, then flash fried salt&pepper cornish game hens. Yum.  Regular items that are a must try:   - rich miso soup that you can add clams and other options to     - soup gyoza: there's soup inside the wonton skin, along with the meat filling. amazing.   - red curry chicken wings: figure it out   - anything with his fried tofu wedges is a HIT   - lime-mint beef: lovers of thai will dig his spin on this   - ginger fish in banana leaf: succulent, clean and flaky  And a full bar and creative owner mean excellent frou frou drinks. But these frou frou's will kick your ass. The Pink Ginger Martini disturbs me just a little because my mom's name is Ginger. But not enough to keep me from downing a couple each time. POW.  I hate to say it, but this place should be packed, and I'm afraid it will be soon. So we're gonna soak it up all we can in meantime.

The decor, ambience isn't "trying too hard", it's just actually "trying" - to be something other than cookie cutter Mexican/Latin, and stand out from its Gilbert Ortega-esque Old Town surroundings. Charming Old World building with modern rustic elements woven in. Obviously some bucks dumped into it.  Everything was very good, some great. The wine list had just what I was looking for - a tasty Albariño and a Vinho Verde. The food was inventive, delicious and packed with flavor, and despite the full dining room, it came out fast. Almost too fast. I'll get into the food more after a few more visits.   I HAVE ONE CONCERN The Mission could become a victim of its own success. Maybe our couple visits were flukes but... We were a party of 4. When we got there it was PACKED. Like bar-packed, not restaurant-packed. Good for them, seriously. The owner (we knew this because we caught his episode of House Hunters Intl) seemed to personally make it his "mission" to keep us happy while we waited. Way cool. Kept checking in with hostess on our behalf and comped our drinks while we waited in the awkwardly crowded bar/hostess stand area. This was all beyond the call of duty for most owners.  So what's the concern? It has obviously become a hotspot with the look-at-me crowd. Hungry, bedazzled cougars and Affliction-afflicted d-bags. And all of them were on the prowl. This is great for business and buzz initially, but it doesn't sustain you when that crowd moves on to the next hotspot. In the meantime, it's hard to become a regular patron for the food&drink when you've got that scene to battle with. On a weekend, even with a reservation, you're likely in for a wait with no good place to wait.  As others have stated, the place appears to be staffed up to the bejeezus. The amount of staff is exaggerated a bit by the shared service style. You probably feel like there are more servers than there really are because you seem to meet all of them! As The Mission inevitably transitions into a calmer, sustainable success, I imagine the frenzy of bar patrons and staff will calm a bit.  All in all, hoping they stay around long enough to transition from a 4-star hunting ground into a 5-star place for us to become regulars.  Oh, and the Churros. Oh my God.

If you want to re-create this much-revered Phoenician favorite at home, here is a very simple recipe:   1) don't buy fish    2) find stale old breadcrumbs in your "cupboard" - form crumbs into a flat, oblong shape and insert into recycled oil from the last batch of fries you made (perhaps last year)    3) slowly bring oil to a boil, cook until a soggy golden brown   4) remove from oil and place onto an entire roll of Brawny®   5) open food-service grade can of tartar slop. dunk fried oblong into slop, bite, chew, cry. repeat.  If you're a real seafood aficionado, throw some crusty horseradish into generic ketchup and dunk in there.  I've yet to find even a scrap of fish in an order of Pete's Fish n' Chips. The name is a lie.

My pregnant wife (The Vessel) demands pancakes on Sundays and after each Dr visit. She seems to be booking a lot of Dr visits.  As usual, Original Pancake House (OPH) was f'ing packed. Too hot to wait outside. We've driven/biked past Bacon a few 100 times since we live close by and kept meaning to try it. Unlike most times we try someplace new, we decided to forego Yelp first and not pre-taint our experience. With a name like Bacon, we knew the reviews would be polarized, regardless of what the place was like.   AMBIANCE It's late June and summer has finally kicked in with a vengeance. A little freaked out that 2 of the 4 walls were opened to the outside, when it was hot as balls. But once inside, instantly charmed. It's like you're transported to a little breakfast joint in Sonoma. Comfy, clean, spacious, modern, homey, welcoming... unexpected in Old Town. Looked like some money was put into it; yet retained a one-off feel, as opposed to a corporate smell. Lots of real wood, chalkboard paint, galvanized metal and food service sized cans on display. I hope the AC bill doesn't put them out of business.   SERVICE The young staff was attentive, friendly and timely. They engaged as much as you cared too, but weren't heavily scripted. Not completely relaxed and smooth like only years of food life can bring, but competent.   FOOD Eggs Benedict is my benchmark for my first time at any breakfast place. Although the menu had tons of things I look forward to exploring, I had to benchmark it. Apparently they were out of canadian bacon, so they subbed a delicious slab of grilled country ham. The scale was a bit off, heavy on the ham side, but it was fantastic breakfast ham and the Benedict was excellent. You could actually taste the English Muffin and it was perfectly toasted. Great, from scratch Hollandaise, not too tart or salty.  The Vessel's French Toast was excellent too. Warm blueberry sauce was the clincher. And the side of bacon was perfect, meaty and balanced between sweet and salty. Definitely cooked to order in our case it wasn't dried out.  The home fries were unlike anything I've had for breakfast. Almost like oven-roasted potatoes you'd get with a pork roast. Loved em.   BOTTOM LINE Now after reading the previous reviews, it seems as if the appropriate asses were kicked or replaced. Everything was competent at a minimum, and mostly excellent. Great to welcome a cool, fresh, inviting breakfast joint to Old Town, since OPH is obscenely busy whenever we want to go, Breakfast Club is obscenely mediocre now and the other alternatives are either corporate or suck.  Looking forward to exploring the menu. And since they have a full bar that can take advantage of how the place opens up, they are going to be open at night once the weather gets nicer.  Yay, drunk biking.  Thanks Bacon! Thanks for transporting us outside of nuclear hot summertime Scottsdale. Until Cafe Monarch reopens in the Fall, you might just be our sole go-to breakfast spot in Scottsdale :-D

First visit  last night. Very happy to see something great go into the Clarendon. Cool to see that little burst of red popping out the front with the glass hinting at people and activity inside. There will be more visits!   FOOD Dig the simple menu. More places should try this: find a few things to make very well, and execute on them. Keep it simple. Add more only as you can do so without lessening the consistency and quality of your core menu.  So far, only had the tacos. They were fresh-tasting, well-seasoned and overall, delicious. A little on the sweet side, but the balance was there. Only critique is to echo that maybe the little metal radiators, while effective at display and containment of tacos, might be dissipating the heat of the food too quickly. Some other more insular, less conductive material might be a better (more expensive?) approach.  Definitely trying the tortas with egg next time.  DRINK Small, but interesting selection. Started with the Madre cocktail. Very fresh grapefruit/citrus flavor. No extra sweetener detected. Also, no vodka detected; but that could be my Irish liver or the power of fresh-squeezed juice. Next a glass of Lo Brujo - bright, minerally refreshing Spanish white. Enough citrus to balance out the mineral and the body.  Both beverages were excellent summer fare.   Updates to follow :-D

I preface by saying: we wanted to like this place. We can bike to it, it's family-friendly and did i mention that it's close? It is busy even before 6pm. Parking is only achieved through luck or valet. Kudos to word getting out about Arcadia Tavern. But...  REVIEW Uninspired bar food in a clean, open, friendly atmosphere. Lack of imagination is clear in the tired sports grill theme - aging fratboy paradise. Might as well be a chain. Then the execution might be tighter. The pizza was basically Freschetta ultra-thin crust, made to order. Almost looked like the pizza in the Nutrisystem commercials - undercooked and topped with processed items.  Fish n' Chips usually deserve their own paragraph. These get 2 paragraphs, but for the wrong reasons:  Fish n' chips batter should be bound to the fish at the molecular level. Attempting to peel the crust off should result in tearing away fish flesh, or revealing fish that is crispy around the edge with the bound batter unwilling to separate. Fish n' Chips don't bend! Cook hot, cook fast, cook through. You can easily achieve this at home with a Waring fryer. A decent batter and a properly used commercial fryer should be a slam-dunk.   Anatomy of an unacceptable fish n' chip: hunk of barely cooked through whitefish, surrounded by a loose layer of mushy batter than is not bound to the fish at all, with a fried-looking but barely crisp outer edge. I removed the end of the fish stick and shook it and the lump of fish fell out of the sad greasy tube. No discernible flavor unless dunked in the accompanying restaurant supply grade tartar slop.   Tots? A moment of inspiration? Sadly no. The key to a tot is that it's made up of little distinct chunks of potato. Like a tiny hash brown capsule. You should be able to break them open and pull apart the pieces. Fast food can even pull this off - the Taco John Potato Olé for example. These were more like greasy, fried mash potatoes. And salty. I'm not drunk enough for this.  I want to give it 3 stars for being clean, having decent service and having no less than 20 plasma displays. But 3 is A-okay. I think there might be something A-okay there, but we haven't found it yet. We will return to try the sliders just to see if there is a dependable fallback dish for those nights when we just don't feel like cooking and want somewhere close. In the meantime, if the owners (investors, more like) care to be more than just the next thing to FAILBOAT in that space, they need to get back to the food. Once the buzz fades, the food will not bring people back. Go to Four Peaks Tempe. Go to Matt's Big B. Go to George n' Dragon. Go to Lo Lo's for chrissake. Go see how simple food can still be good food, and not scream "short-term, dabbling in the industry business model".  Will update after another visit. Maybe.

I picked this particular OG because it is the closest offender, geographically, to my compound.  As succinctly as possible: you suck the life out of Italian Food, you bastards. You are the epitome of all that is wrong with corporate food service. The only way that you could add more salt and remove more life from your food is if you were called "The Red Olive Lobster Garden".  You suck. You know you suck. And you are killing people with your crappy food. Die.  (apparently, I have to give you 1 star. suck it.)

I love what this place is striving towards. Things I specifically love:   1) a stable, dependable, local outdoor farmer's market on Saturday and Wednesday - full of awesome local goods and repping the people who actually grow/make the stuff  2) a permanent building housing a stock of a selection of said goods, open most days of the week  3) although i'm already a locavore, discovering new sources for real food, like DoubleCheck Ranch's beef etc - i'm a huge fan!  4) the cool design and layout of the structure  5) a genuinely friendly atmosphere and helpful, if still learning, staff  6) the constantly fresh-roasted beans at the Royal Coffee Bar - hayes is the (somewhat effeminate) man!  7) a place to keep discovering new quirky local arts and foodstuffs   I hope to give this 5 stars in the future. Here's what needs to happen:   1) be open on Sunday  2) expand your offerings and keep the shelves filled (i know this is a challenge)  3) have more ppl available to help ring up during busy times (market saturday, etc)  4) inspire more confidence that if i order a sammich, i'll get it before dinner (i haven't ordered one yet, but i'm scared to because i don't know who's gonna make it - i don't see anyone cooking stuff!)  Ultimately, this is EXACTLY the kind of stuff phoenix needs in its efforts to  be the "real city" that everyone bitches it ain't. So if you want it to succeed and want more of this in phoenix's future, support it. Give constructive feedback. Buy real local food instead of the crap at most supermarkets.   You have 3 choices: support, bitch or get stoned and order domino's

I was hesitant to eat here. More sad than scared. We were so in love with SeaSaw and such giant fans of Nobu; so it was bittersweet to hear that something good had opened in the former SeaSaw location.  But from the moment we were met by Pavle at the door, we got over the past and were ready to jump in. Enough has probably been said about the food, in more detail than I care to get into. But 2 things stand out:  1) my wife is the ribeye queen. you wouldn't know it to look at her, but she'll hork down a whole ribeye while i'm still on my first cut of my filet. well a new standard has been set. they source their beef from a farm in kansas called Creekstone Farms. it was the best ribeye she's ever tasted and she savored every bite. she's even gotten in touch with the farm to try to get some for home.  2) i don't eat vegetable pastas. ever. i know there are some very good vegetable pastas, but i just have this hangup about having at least some small amount of animal protein in my pasta. a little pancetta, seafood, whatever. that ended with the strozza preti (priest chokers) at FnB. not a scrap of meat in sight and it was fantastic. i nibbled slowly on every tender little noodle to drag out the experience.  FnB simply fires on all cylinders. From the initial greeting to the final sip, slurp or bite. Don't miss it.

Rounding down from 4.49 to 4 because that's how we do it. I wish half stars were available.  Look, I'm not going to say this is the best pizza ever in history. Or even the best in the Valley because a straight-up review shouldn't be about comparing local pizza to Bianco. So...  When my wife and I could finally afford the time-off and the cost of a real honeymoon, we rented a car and drove Europe with almost no agenda for awhile. One of our stops that we happened upon was Santa Margherita, Italy. This cool little village is on the Portofino Peninsula. But unlike Portofino itself it wasn't loaded with Loveboat tourists. It seemed to be mostly young Italians looking to get laid (after eating fantastic food of course!). Kind of like what the douchebags from Jersey Shore wish they were. But, they aren't. Because real Italians don't say stupid shit like "pro-jute" and "mootzarell" or "GTL".  At the end of the strip of venues catering to partiers, on the walk back up to our hotel, was/is? a little place called Santa Lucia. It was the essence of simplicity and taste. We found ourselves eating there at least twice a day. A couple times we'd have dinner there, go out, and come back and take a pizza back to our little terrace and eat naked on the balcony after the love. My wife's lack of clothing very likely made more people happy than my ass.  Pomo Pizzeria evoked strong memories of that perfect pizza at Santa Lucia. And that means a lot. It's great that they have this special certification of 'Verace Pizza Napoletana' - but that's not what matters to me. It's how distinctly wonderful it tastes and how many memories it brings back.  STUFF I LOVE 1) simple, simple, simple. with the right ingredients and the right approach, you don't need designer pizza pretension or bullshit.  2) friendly from the first phone call to the greeting at the door to every step after. that sticks with you. service was thoughtful, personal and well-timed without being patronizing.  3) welcoming to families. we know how challenging this can be and we're pretty conscious of the impact a teething baby can have on our neighbors. but a family-friendly place tends to attract family-friendly customers and our daughter enjoyed flirting with anyone around us. and when the teeth struck, it was easy enough to take her on a calming walk through the beautiful grounds.  4) Borgata is that weird place that should be doing so much better than it is. It's got location, it's got charm. It's built like brick shithouse. and it's got a genuine Old World feel (dare I say, Tuscan), but it's not faux like everything else these days. this place is really made of stone and it wastes tons of square footage with unused vertical space and wandering outdoor areas. and that right there is probably why it's hard to monetize this place, especially when in a shit economy, and being owned by Macerich. so I love that Pomo adds some vibrance to a place that I pray never gets bulldozed in favor of stucco palace full of "concepts".   STUFF I DON'T LOVE [i got nothing]   The fact that this is minutes from where we live is a huge bonus. It's not going to cut into our Bianco time, because nothing other than our feisty daughter could do that. It will more likely cut into our lunch and cooking at home time. So be it.  After exploring the menu more, I could see 5.

Echo is the neighborhood coffee shop I was waiting for. What I wasn't expecting was for it to become my neighborhood lunch spot as well. I'm stuck on the Cubano. It is all kinds of yummy roast pork and stuff. Since I can't break away from that, my wife tried the Mediterranean Tuna sandwich and it was so good that we split sammiches next time.  Keep up the good work, Echo. You definitely deserve the following you're garnering. Plus, I'm glad to see that building put to some good use. Hopefully some other quality businesses will fill in the open spot(s) and we'll have even more reason to make it a destination. A kickass Mexican market would be awesome. There is definitely both the Hispanic and Gringo crowd to support it in the area.  As for the lack of free refills... doesn't that imply that if I didn't drink 1 gallon of tea that I got ripped off? What about all of us 1 big beverage drinkers who are satisfied with the price we pay for our 1 drink. Are we supposed to feel stupid for not maximizing our liquid intake? To me, free refills make sense if you're at a sit-down place that is primarily about food and you're going to be there a longish time due to the food service. For a place that is primarily a coffee/beverage spot with some good food, allowing people to sit and drink free drinks all day would be a bad business decision. If you disagree, open up the Free Refills joint next door. Prove me wrong.  Perhaps a compromise is to add a discounted refill to the menu. That will please the regulars who hang out and abuse the T3 and serve those who suck down lots of liquids in a short time.  (a T3/DS3? really? i have my doubts that an entire T3/DS3 is being dedicated to this shop. that's enough bandwidth to serve a good-sized office building and host some websites with good traffic. a simple Cox cable connection is a fraction of the cost and often far faster.)

I should be disqualified from reviewing anywhere that Nobu cooks. My love runs that deep. So I'll just drop off this 5-star and continue to post photos of every delicious meal.

Blech. ~$5 burger that I could hardly differentiate from one of those things wrapped in foil for 3 days at AM/PM. Didn't even finish it.  Also, the employees laughing and goofing around while some seriously fucked up, tripping, bloody homeless guy traipsed through the place purposely smearing his blood and sweat all over the people and the equipment didn't exactly wet my appetite. If he tried to touch my daughter I would have killed him with our stroller and then started in on the staff.  Extra star for the now bloody pile of peanuts and potato in the middle of the room. That's pretty fun.

Even when the Coffee Plantation was there, the Biltmore FP was not a place to get a decent coffee. Then, with even the lackluster  Plantation gone, mall employees and visitors alike were left with only Borders and Paradise (*shudders*).  Royal is such a wonderful and welcome addition to the Biltmore area. The use of the lobby space leading into the Red Door Spa is very clever, and the coffee bar and seating area itself are typical of Haye's talent for mixing design and functionality. It is the real deal and I look forward to drinking gallons of their delicious brews over the coming years.    Roast on, Royal.

I need to go back. At this point, I can only go by the farts that this place created after my first visit.  Blah blah blah charming. Yes. This is true.   But 3 bites into whatever charming stuff we ordered, I was farting. Good farts. The kinda new, exploratory farts I Iove. The kinda farts that say: Hey buddy, this isn't Pho. This sammich isn't simply a Jambon Beurre with colonial French asian stuff on it. This stuff made me react.  I'm definitely going back.

Soft opening, so take it with a perfect grain of salt.  As much as it is a homecoming for Bianco, being back at T&C is also a re-awakening it seems. A sort of do-over. This is the stuff we always wanted to see Christopher do. As the Bianco Realm expands here and overseas, it's clear that he is energized, yet still as himself as ever.  FOOD We had...  Grilled head-on white shrimp with white beans:  As good as it gets. Simple, delicious, layers of flavor, but you taste every bean. And suck those shrimp heads! They are awesome. For me, as basic as it was, this was the stand-out dish.  Fennel and orange salad: Refreshing and simple. But good contrast. Great bite between dishes to refresh. Keep one around.  Pork ragu over Fusilli: Hearty, carrot-sweet, firm noodles, rustic chunky pork gravy. This is so up my alley.  Burnt-butter fried sage sauce spinach/ricotta ravioli: good lord.  Seafood stew: these things almost alway look the same. And this is no exception in the looks department. The difference is, where you usually get the same old tomato broth with a bunch of chewy crustaceans and throw-away whitefish... here you get tender bits of delicious sea creatures, each with their own flavor. All in a broth that actually tastes like seafood, not just salty tomato soup. Only suggestion: a big chunk of rustic Marco Bianco bread on the side to sop up all the delicious broth!  Flourless chocolate cake thing with lightly whipped cream: I'm not a dessert guy, so my wife and I split one. We shouldn't have split just one.  OVERALL Friendly, confident, competent, attentive service. Pretty easy to do on an early soft opening night. We'll see how they do when they're in the weeds. But this crew seems like they're on it, and ready.  The food is what you dream of having if a friend took you to a chef's house in the Italian countryside and said: "We're gonna eat what his family eats when they get together and cook simple, fresh, amazing real food." This is so welcome in Phoenix. And it would be welcome anywhere, if we lived there :-)  As the menu will keep changing, we're looking forward to exploring over the coming years. Bravo Christopher (and Erin and Stevey and Claudio and Marco and Sergio and Crew)!

This place just keeps growing on me. The Schnitzel Sub is a perfect lunch. And Jaeger Stew is back for the season. Nice.

"What do you wanna do tonight, Bren?"  "Donna, haven't you heard? The Peach Pit is open at night now."  "Oh yeah, Peach Pit After Dark. Let's go!"  "Totes! I hear Dylan is juicing now. He must be huge. I hope he grinds me."
