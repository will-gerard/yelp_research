I love Le Studio.  I have been to several people there and have loved the results. Whitney is awesome.  Sabrea did my make up for wedding and a few occasions, Carla has done my eyebrows, and they were both great. I just spent 5 hrs with Whitney and she transformed me!  I got the perfect ombr√© hair that I have been trying to get, then she tinted my eyebrows, waxed my eyebrows, tinted my eyelashes and then gave me eyelash extensions for a wedding.  She was awesome and I felt amazing when I left her chair.  I have gone to le studio for many years now and it has yet to disappoint.

Yummy all the way.  Hard to get all the basics exactly right but Mangos has delicious beans, rice, tortillas, and the Carne asada is bomb.  Then to top it off they have the awesome fresh fruit drinks which are a highlight for me.  I like to mix them, strawberry with pineapple, mango, watermelon, they all make my mouth water.

I haven't been in a few months but I was so so so excited to hear about a Venezuelan restaurant I Mesa, I used to live there and miss the food terribly.  Most things were spot on, the plantains with white cheese I have never personally seen to buy at the stores, the arepas were good, the empanadas were good although the dough was thicker than what I would buy in the streets in Venezuela, so I was kind of disappointed in that but the thing that I really wanted was the green sauce that all empanada stands have and when I asked for some I got green sauce but nothing like the delicious stands in Venezuela.  I will say I was very impressed with how close the food was to what I used to eat daily.  If you don't like this place, you probably would not want to spend much time in Venezuela, cause this is it.

I was dying for some drunken noodles, saw this place close and gave it a go.  They open at 11, I tried 1058, no one there realized how early and killed time at the dollar store, came back at 1114, still not open, started to leave and someone ran to the door to unlock it, still had her purse on so I know she just walked in the door.  I ordered takeout drunken noodles and asked how long it might be since I know they just walked in, 5 min.  I didn't know whether to be happy or scared.  How could that be ready in 5 min? It was obvious they took old stuff and just re fried it, pretty greasy and nothing tasted fresh.  I am not one to know authenticity, but I had some drunken noodles in San Diego that I am trying to find something similar here.  This is my 3rd round with the noodles and just a few other times eating Thai apart from that, but this was my worst for sure out of all of them.  I don't know Thai food real well, but I know fresh, and I didn't get anything fresh here.  Also, smelled like old lady moth balls

I love Synergy.  Clean, pretty office, nice front office, great hygienists with a soft touch, and a Dr Ellingson is fantastic making my kids feel comfortable.  Highly recommend

Yummy fresh ingredients, toasted bread that was delish.  Shakes were good.  The salads were really fresh...but seemed a little boring especially compared to the great sandwiches.  The desserts looked really good but we didn't get anything besides the shakes.  My teen nephews were still hungry after their sandwiches and they don't offer different sizes, but it was perfect size for me.

Every one we tried was delish.  I am pretty picky about empanadas because I used to live in Venezuela where they are on every corner and better than any I have had here.  They had green sauce that was legit like the Venezuelan street vendors which I haven't seen since I left.  It went well with the chicken, the rest are very fusion type empanadas but I liked that there were traditional and empanadas like the Nutella banana.  Great mix of new and old and so yummy

So far so good.  I have only been twice, but both times I got in really easily and it is a new facility so it is very clean and nice looking.  I have been searching for a new primary care because I think it is ridiculous when I can't get to my doctor for a day or two when I am sick...like I have that time to just hang around when I could get in and start getting better quicker.  Truthfully I don't have a ton of experience here, but it is definitely more promising than the other options I have tried.  Clean, professional, Dr Gazda is nice and easy to talk to, the office staff is easy to work with, and i can easily get same day appt, no complaints here.

I went to Dr Judy in desperation on a referral because I was having issues none of my doctors or specialists could figure out.  She knew in her first visit with me what it likely was.  Changed my life.  I wish my insurance covered her.  I just can't find anyone I trust more than her with my health.  She is amazing...nothing short.  If you can't figure something out or how to fix your health...you need her.

They catered our work party and it I got a white truffle burger that was SO good.  Their fries were super tasty as well, some of the best I have had.

If I could give 0 stars I would.  I used to come here a lot when it was the previous owners.  I would pay 3 bucks, and since I did the vacuuming myself it was better than most do on my minivan.  But they used to have a guy in the front of the wash to brush some of the guts off before it went in.  No more with this new owner, which is why all the bugs are there like I never washed it.  Today I paid for the 7 dollar wash because my tires needed it, if you look at the after picture it is no where near clean.  It is one thing to pay 7, and get all sweaty doing the vacuuming myself so it is up to par, but they don't have the little air detailing gun things like they used to have so I couldn't do anything more than I could at home.  I spoke to the guy there working and showed him my car, he said they don't do the brushing anymore because of liability, and he admitted the tires should have gotten cleaner than they should have,  but didn't offer another run through or refund or to do anything to help the situation.  I told him there is a car wash full service car wash that also costs 7 bucks and they do the work for me, which I will gladly do now that this gem of a car wash has gone to pots.
