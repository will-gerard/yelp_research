Duke photography is professional and Polite. Their photographers are really good at posing and making everyone look like a professional model.  They're easily the best in Arizona.

This place is sooooooo awesome!!!!  I eat here at least once a week. The staff is friendly and the environment is awesome. If you don't know what to get they always recommend something good. lately I've been getting the lamb Kabob.

This place is awesome!!! I got the caremelized onions and blue cheese. It was soooooo good.  I've been eating healthy for the last 5 months and have been sad because I couldn't find  a place to eat that serves burgers.  Then this place came along and made all my dreams come true. I had an awesome burger and walked away still feeling great.  The decor is nice and clean. It doesn't have rock and roll posters on the wall but what the heck does that have to do with awesome burgers, Besides, who wants sensory overload while they're enjoying a burger. The only sensory overload I need is the one that was going on with my taste buds.  This is a local place and I'm more than happy to support it. The foods delicious so why not. The family that works there is really cool and friendly too.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to get a good burger.

I go here every two weeks, JR is awesome. If you're a guy he finishes you up with the straight razor. I'd definitely recommend him.

Worked with them for half an hour called them on the phone also. Then told me there's a $7.00 fee to cash it after she runs the check.  bad business. Now I use midfirst bank they are wayyyyyyyy  better.

SCAM ALERT!   I paid over four hundred dollars $400 to get my brakes changed and change some filters. Crazy right? On top of that they  CHANGED THE WRONG BRAKES  and my car sounds like Crap now. WTF?. Also when I tried to talk to someone on the phone she was    EXTREMELY RUDE (she actually YELLED AT ME, who yells?) and just kept telling me to set an appointment and wouldn't listen then SHE SAID SHES GOING TO HANG UP ON ME unless I want to set an appointment. I went to them for oil changes before and thought I could trust them     DO NOT TRUST THEM for anything more than $40. Also all my other reviews are 5 stars. I'm a hard person to disappoint but hey if the shoe fits use it to go     GO TO ANOTHER MECHANIC  If they ever call me back I'd try to fix this but they don't. And if you,see this review that means they don't care
