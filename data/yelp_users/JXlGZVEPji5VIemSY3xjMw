This place is terrible! They use to have a few quality barbers now they have all left!  They use a number system to determine who's next in line, however they allow their friends to come in and skip in line and not have to get a number! This will be the last time I ever come to here- the convenience isn't worth their poor business practices!

Ate at the one off Valencia in Tucson for years - I was thrilled to hear they were building one up here.   We go in here once every week or 2. Same great hotdogs, carne asada and salsa bar that you'll find at the original.  Go give this place a try!
