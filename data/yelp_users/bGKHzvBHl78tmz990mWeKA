We had dinner here while at the SHOT Show and it was fabulous. Lupita seated us and she was so friendly and sweet, then Karl took care of us. The chips were big and warm and the salsa was delicious. I had the roasted veggie fajitas and they were the best I've ever had--fresh broccoli, mushrooms, peppers, zucchini, cherry tomatoes and onions with a yummy marinade, served with spicy guacamole, pico, and beans and rice. The cilantro rice is really tasty. My husband had a chili relleno, chicken enchilada, and a tamale. He chose the black beans and Mexican rice and they were good too, but I liked the cilantro rice and refried beans best. The portions were big and we left stuffed. Absolutely a great place. Nice and casual, and we didn't need a reservation. Price was right, too. Even with a decent tip it was less than $50.

This is one of our favorite places for coffee or tea. The homemade pastries, chocolates, and treats are scrumptious. It's small so seating may be short at the busy times, but if I had to I would just get my stuff to go. They have free wifi too!

I'm vegan, so I'm used to hardly any choices when I'm forced to eat at restaurants, but I can usually find something halfway decent. In Vegas for a convention, we got to the hotel tired and hungry, but didn't have reservations, so we went to the food court. I had the grilled veggie bowl. It consisted of lots of sliced eggplant and yellow squash on brown rice. The veggies were mushy and tasteless and the brown rice was hard as a rock. It actually scared me - I thought I broke a crown! There seemed to be no sauce or seasoning of any kind. Soy sauce and red pepper flakes helped a little. The onion rings were good though. My husband had the teriyaki chicken bowl. He said the smoked chicken was really good but his didn't have any sauce on it either. His brown rice was also hard. Not hard as in undercooked- hard and stuck together in little clumps like it had been sitting under a heat source for a LONG time. Since the veggies were the only vegan choice I could see aside from onion rings and fries, we won't be going back there. I must tell you that the lady who took our order was very nice and efficient, and aside from a lousy dinner we are enjoying our stay at the Tropicana.

We stopped by after the Taiyou Con. Tiny little place like a mom and pop outfit in a strip mall. But man is the food good! We had vegetable tempura, vermicelli with egg roll, and Pad Thai. All excellent with fresh cilantro, lettuce, sprouts, etc. portions are big. Our waiter and waitress barely spoke English-- it was like having dinner in Vietnam. I loved it.

This place is great! It's a real ER with wonderful doctors and PA's and techs. They are thorough and caring. We went there for a heart issue and they got us in to see the Doctor right away. The arranged for transport to a hospital and made sure that we had everything we needed to stay comfortable. I would definitely go here again but I hope we don't need to! First class operation - scrupulously clean, efficient, and very caring.
