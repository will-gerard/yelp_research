Best green chili burritos in the valley! Enchilada-style is excellent, but regular style is just as good. They have tacos and tostadas every once in a while, but I wasn't impressed. They just don't compare to the burritos. The red chili burrito is best with beans, enchilada style with a side of rice, but you have to go with the GREEN chili burrito first if it's your first time. I never get anything else now.

By far my favorite comic store to purchase by Buffyverse comics! I was so tied up the last few months that I didn't get a chance to pick up the latest Buffy comics so I was driving all around town trying to get the back issues I missed for the last 7 months. I hit 3 other comic book stores before coming to this place because of their proximity. Some only had one issue left and others didnt have anymore left. I should have came to AABC from the beginning! Not only did they have all the back issues I needed they even had some variant covers available. The staff there went out of their way to check in the back for all the issues I was looking for since they were no longer on display. They must have had to really dig in the backstock room to get my issues since the guy was in the back for about 15 minutes. So worth it though! They are a bit of a distance from my house, but they are well worth making the drive. I havent gotten into other comics outside those of Buffyverse yet, but this would definitely be my go-to place when I get time to read other comics! They have a huge selection, not only of new comics, but also lots of collectors editions dating back to my mama's childhood years!

I loved coming to this place for lunch when I worked down town. The gyros were good. The best in town? I think not - I much prefer Papa's Gyros which are more flavorful. I love their fries though! The service is quick and friendly. Parking can be a pain though.

My fiance took me here to celebrate after he won a poker tournament. He wanted an intimate/romantic dinner to celebrate so we glamoured up thinking this was going to be a very dressy kind of place. We were wrong. Upon walking into the restaurant we felt very overdressed in my cocktail dress and he in his newly bought suit. Most of the people dining there were in summer shorts and polos. Looked more like they were dressed to go golfing! Regardless, we greatly enjoyed our romantic dinner. The lights in the dining area were dim and wasn't loud at all. It was the perfect intimate setting.  We shared a pear salad and crab cake to start with. The salad left a little to be desired, but the crab cake was DELICIOUS! For the entree he had the beef tenderloin and I had the salmon. He won that choice! We shared the Raspberry Charlotte for desset. It was absolutely out of this world! Probably one of the best desserts I've ever had. The portion was huge, we could barely finish it between the two of us.  The waiter was VERY attentive and friendly. He made great recommendations on food and wine (which paired perfectly with our meal) and we didnt feel rushed at all between courses. He cleared our plates diligently after we finished each meal and always carefully whipped our table before bringing out the next course. Best service we've ever had at a restaurant!  After we finished our dinner we walked around in the courtyard for a bit. It was beautiful! The trees were decorated in lights and the fountains were on and lit which created a romantic setting for us two love birds. We'll definitely be back!

This is probably my favorite Harkins theatre to catch a movie. I love the close proximity to great restaurants even though it can get pretty difficult to find a good parking spot on weekends. Theatres and seats are usually maintained fairly clean and moviegoers who come here are pretty respectful. No pack of 15 yr olds crowding the entrance waiting for their parents to pick them up here! Like Maggie mentioned, it's also your best bet if you're interested in catching a foreign or indie movie in the area, though they are never a guarantee, but definitely beats driving all the way to Camelview in Scottsdale when these type of films are available here.

I definitely prefer this Marshall's to the one near downtown Phoenix. I find the staff friendlier and their aisles are more organized. Gets very crowded and a bit messy during the holiday season though, but then again what store doesnt right? I love the location since it's close to Costco, Borders, Harkins movie theatre, Cold Stone, frozen yogurt and other great restaurants. I love shopping here!

I don't know what I was thinking driving all the way to Pho Thanh after reading a few great reviews on Yelp. 43rd Express definitely has far superior Pho. Broth was flavorful and not oily like Thanh. $5 for a bowl of Pho? What a steal! The egg rolls were a bit too oily for my taste but the spring rolls were pretty good. Service was not up to par though. When I walked in I was warmly greeted and server was attentive upon taking my order, but I was disappointed once I got my meal. I'm not sure if this is a common thing in Vietnamese restaurants because everyone I've been to I've experience similar service, but once my meal was brought to my table the service pretty much went out the door. It's difficult to even get their attention. They just retrieve to behind the cash register or are more preoccupied with welcoming new customers. Not the nicest location either and they only take cash, but I don't really mind given that it's some of the best Pho I've had.

This is my favorite place to shop for "make your own sushi night". They always have all the stuff we need to roll our perfect sushi at home. I haven't had a chance to explore their actually seafood selection nor the produce though. The neighborhood is not the best and their parking lot could use some repairs. Nevertheless, I love coming to this market!

I LOVE their gyros! They seriously have the most flavorful gyro meat I've ever had. Service is a tad slow but they are all very friendly. Lunch specials under $10.

This place is right across the street from my parent's house and though I used to live there a few years ago, I never once was interested in going in. It's in a strip mall so it's not very easy to spot. My fiance likes coming here with his buddies for dinner during his Guys' Nights. He always came home smelling like fried food so I was never curious in the slightest sense to come here. He brought me home some Thai Chile Wings after a night out with the guys and I found those delicious, but I still couldn't get over the smell of fried fish every time he came back from this place. He and some friends dragged us here after a day at the shooting range. I was still skeptical when we walked into the bar, but was pleasantly surprised after trying their food. Their buffalo wings were good. I had the spicy beef sandwhich, which I couldnt finish because it was fairly big. The nacho cheese made it somewhat messy, but delicious nonetheless. My fiance loves the Buffalo Burger here. The beer came out nice and cold and the waitress was very friendly and constantly came back to check on us. She knows the guys by now because they come in so often so they had a little fun banter back and forth. Left here smelling like fried fish, no doubt - even though no one at our table had any fish. THat's really my only complain about this place, but I have to admit I really enjoyed the food. Very casual, good food, friendly wait staff. The Mr. wont have to drag me to come here again! :-P

The Mr. and I stopped by for breakfast after craving some good ol' diner pancakes and eggs. We each had the Bobbie's Breakfast Special - $3.99 for 2 eggs, golden home fries and 2 slices of bacon. The food was pretty good, but the service wasn't the best. The waitress was attentive - if not overly attentive! Everytime she kept coming back to check on us she would stop and stare at us watching us eat for I swear what felt like a whole minute - not saying anything, just staring! My husband ordered a side of pancakes to go with his breakfast special and she made a comment about how much food we ordered. Who wants to go out to eat and be judged by how much food you order? Please just do your job, take our order, bring our meal and refill our coffee. No need to judge or stare! But where else can you get a full breakfast for under $5 though? Will definitely be back if we're on this side of town...as long as we don't get the judgemental waitress with the staring problem!

Pancakes topped with ice cream, fruit and whipped cream for breakfast?? Hell yes!!! Sounds more like dessert, but every bit delicious on an empty stomach on a Saturday morning. My fiance brought me here one day during the summer when I went with him to PGH to visit his family. We heard about the rave reviews on Man vs. Food so we decided we had to hit up all of Adam Richman's picks in PGH during our trip. We waited in line in the warm sun for about 20-30 minutes to be seated, but it was well worth it! My fiance had the mixed grill - loaded with grilled veggies, potatoes, and spicy sausage. We kept switching plates back and forth because we just couldnt decide who got the best meal. Both the pancakes and the mixed grill were HUGE! We could barely finish both. Inexpensive and good service. We'll defintely be back when we visit PGH again!

Thank you Adam Richman!! We had seen it on Man vs. Food and our mouths watered after seeing the sandwhiches.This was our second restaurant stop while visiting PGH with my fiance during the summer. We split the steak sandwhich (added a fried egg) and chilli cheese fries. Both were absolutely delectable! We were even served by the spunky older lady seen helping Adam on MVF. It was a great treat. Since we live in AZ and can't get this awesome sandwhich whenever our hearts desire we make our own "Primanti Brothers" style sandwhich at home...we still can't get that special cole slaw recipe down though! We'll definitely be coming back on our next PGH trip!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE their pizza! For me it's all about their cheese...like nothing I've ever had. The sauce is just perfect, they dont overdo it. They are always super friendly when my husband and I stop by. They practically know us by now bc we stop by here so often, whether its picking up a whole pizza or grabbing a slice onthego. Their wings are a bit small but delicious. They pack on the buffalo sauce so they are all messy! Mmmm...finger lickin good!

This is probably my least favorite Harkins to go catch a movie - aside from the one at Metro! Every weekend this place is crowded with jr high kids just hanging out near the entrance. Seriously? You get dropped off by mom to sit in front of a movie theatre and do what, check out other 14 year olds walk by? Having a full jr high school inside the theatre makes for a very unpleasant movie experience. I can't tell you how many times I've had to "shh" a kid next to me or asked them take their phone/text conversations outside. 1/5 times the kids in there are just texting back and forth or making out in the theatre the whole time while their other friends are giggling and throwing popcorn at the lovebirds. Seriously, don't waste your mommy's $ if you're not going to actually watch the movie. Anything you do there you could do at the park for free, so please stay away from my theatre!! Only reason I come back is because it's the closest theatre from my house. Otherwise I take my souvenir cup to Harkins Park West.

Wine and liquor mecca! Hallelujah! This store has a much greater selection than Bevmo and even at cheaper prices. It's my one-stop place to shop for a big party or just when I'm itching for a good bottle of wine. The staff is very knowledgeable and always give me great recommendations. The hubby and I did all our shopping here for our open bar wedding reception. They give you a discount if you buy full cases (I think it was either 10 or 15% off per case).  I LOVE that they offer a great selection of single bottles. If you like to try different brews but are skeptical about getting a whole 6-pack you have to check out their single bottles aisle. They have a great selection organized by country and you can even mix and match to create your very own six-pack. Booze heaven!

Absolutely horrible! If I could give this place half a star, or a negative star even, I would! The service was slow. The sushi was terrible.   The Mr. and I came here during lunch, we had a total of 4 rolls (2 on their "happy hour lunch menu" and 2 regular specialty rolls). No drinks, only water. We ended up spending more during lunch here than we would have spent at Blu Sushi or Ah-So during dinner. We sat at the sushi bar so I could ask for my signature specialty roll which normaly costs about $9 at Blu and this place charged $13.95! It wasn't anything too extravagant nor hard to make - I could make these at home myself! When we questioned our waitress about our bill she said "oh sushi chef wanted $14, but I say no, $13.95!" WOW, a whopping 5 cents, thanks lady, I'll just take that extra 5 cents and buy me something pretty from the Old Navy across the street! Are you kidding me?!  The price on the bill could have been worth it if the sushi was top-notch, but this sushi was bland, NOT fresh, the pieces were either tiny or falling apart. We had our friend over the other night for home-made sushi and when we compared sushi restaurants she raved about this place....seriously. Oh boy, we felt horrible for her. She obviously had never tried REAL, DELICIOUS sushi before! I'm better off making my own sushi at home then coming to this place! NEVER AGAIN!

Been to this place a few times in the last 2 years and always had a good time, so when I heard they were having an Open Bar for New Year's Eve I jumped at gathering a few friends to celebrate here. I called ahead to see if we could purchase tickets ahead of time or see if we can make a reservation. They said they were expecting a huge crowd so just to show up really early. Come New Year's Eve night my friends and I get there at about 845ish. Band wasn't on yet, there were still a few tables open abd the bar wasn't crowded at all. The hubby ordered some fish and chips to munch on with our beers. Wasn't impressed. Nor was I in the past when I tried their food other nights, so I didn't have high expectations anyhow. Open bar was just $20 for ladies, $30 for guys. It was well worth it!! Included all draft beer and a selection of shots. We definitely had a great time here and took advantage of the open bar. Bartender even let us know when there was a cab available outside when we were good and drunk. The bar never got too crowded and crowd didn't get too crazy - aside for a few girls who threw up all over themselves in the restroom. But you know everyone's having a good time when the ladie's room gets backed up and no one cares because we're all just having a good time chitchatting with each other - cat fight free.

This is the hubby and mine's theatre of choice. It's a little further down from the much closer Harkins Gateway near our house, but that place is always packed with kids out front trying to catch a date...thus resulting in the worst movie experience possible. The last thing I need is for two 15 year olds to ruin a good movie for me while they're trying to hook up or texting in the middle of the movie. We've yet to have a bad experience at Park West (knock on wood). We find the audiences here to be a little older and more respectful, so we've always had a pleasant viewing experience here. We see a lot of couples come here sans kids, just trying to enjoy their Friday night. The theatres are pretty clean and well kept as well.

Food here is excellent! I've only had their chicken, steak and short ribs, but they were all excellent. The short ribs are tender and so flavorful you don't even need to add the side teriyaki sauce, but you just have to because it's some of the best sauce I've had! Combo plates are served with a side of white rice and macaroni salad. Salad is just okay, but both sides go excellent with the meat. The lady at the register always greets me with a friendly smile, but she's never really been the friendliest when taking my order. With food so good, I don't even care. I've kept coming back!

Came here after purchasing a coupon from Groupon. $10 for $20 worth of food - not a bad deal, so thought about trying it out for the 1st time especially since the hubby and I love bbq. We were definitely not impressed though! I ordered the Smothered Pork sandwhich and the Mr. ordered the Shack Sample with ribs, pork and chicken tenders. My sandwhich was just average. The pork was decent, but the cole slaw smothered on top was way too dry! It was more like cabbage mix than actually slaw. When I think of "smoothered pork" I think of the food and sauce just dripping over the bun. Not in this case. My husband's chicken tenders were very meaty, but a bit dry and not very flavorful. Their shack sauce definitely helped to improve the flavor though. The only thing I liked from his plate was the ribs. The baked beans we had as a side were okay. Mac and cheese was disappointing. Like Andrea L. mentioned, tasted like school cafeteria food. Too bland. Fries were decent.   I couldn't believe how packed this place was on a weekday night though. It must be the location convinience, having a theatre and arena nearby. I can't imagine people honestly being there for the food. Save your $ and bbq cravings and go to Fritzi's on Dysart! Even Honey Bears beats this - easy!

I love Valentina! Came to her for the 1st time when I needed to get my wedding dress fixed last October. I received my dress from the bridal store just 2 weeks prior to my wedding and I was stressing BIG TIME because the dress needed a lot of work. Brought it to Valentina after reading so many good reviews on here and was very impressed! My dress was all lace so I knew she would need plenty of time just to get it hemmed. She was friendly, kept me calm and was very suggestive as to how to make the dress not only fit me perfectly, but flatter me as well. I put all my trust in her and picked up the dress 1 day prior to the wedding, yes ONE day, and it turned out beautiful! She did such an amazing job in such a short notice. I even ordered my wedding shoes from her and they arrived quickly and fit perfectly. I will always be grateful to her for relieving me of a major worry and doing the best job with my dress. So, when my sister's BIG day arrived a few weeks ago, I of course turned to her once more when I needed to get the straps adjusted on my matron of honor dress. She of course did a quick and excellent job yet again. Although, she is a bit of a drive from where I live, she is worth every bit the gas prices!

My fiance and I love coming to this Pub because it was the place where we had our fist date. It's not even on our side of town, but we're willing to make the 30 min drive nowdays because it is a meaninful place. Had this not been the place where our story began, we would still be coming back because we still enjoy the food here a lot.   We usually always start with the Salmon Cakes (very good) and/or the Bollix Spicy Potato Balls served with a side of buffalo wing sauce and ranch dressing. The spicy balls are indeed spicy but very enjoyable - one of our favs here and if we're ever here for just a few drinks, this is our munchie food!  Since I'm always up for trying new things, and having never tried Pub food before, I was very curious to try the Boxty on our first date...until I saw Salmon on the menu (which I had been craving the last week). I was torn! Being the sweetheart that he is, my fiance told me to get the Pecan Salmon and he would get the Boxty so I can try both. Boy did I feel horrible after his Boxty plate came out. My salmon was absolutely delicious! Perfectly juicy and full of flavor - even the veggies were a delight! His Boxty however...that was something we will NEVER order again. Now, we've never had Boxty before in our lives, so we dont have anything to compare it to, but this was so bland. No flavor whatsoever! My poor date tried to scarf down his flavorless meal because he was starving that night, but I could tell he was not enjoying it because of the look he had on his face, like "I can't belive I'm eating this disguisting food, but she's cute and I'm starving so what the hell I'll just man up". I eventually convinced him to put his dish aside and share some of my salmon. We definitely cleaned that plate! We laughed at my poor first choice of food and guzzled down our beers which were nice and cold.  We've had the burgers with a side of Irish Chips on other occassions. They were good and tasted pretty fresh. I really enjoyed the Irish Chips. We've also had the Shepherd's Pie here. It's a big serving so we shared that one. Decent, not the best I've had though.   We've never been disappointed with our drinks or bartenders here. Somehow we end up with the same bartender every time my fiance and I go eat here alone (we usually sit at the bar). He is always friendly and attentive. I never complain about the drink selection here because I enjoy their draft selection. I always stick to my Snake Bite or Hoegaarden, or if I ever feel the need for some liquor I go for my usualy SoCo Lime and my fiance will usually stick to Harp.  The dining area can get VERY loud if you're ever there on a Friday or Saturday night after 8 or 9pm when they have live music, but sometimes they have a live Irish band which is kinda fun to listen to if you enjoy Irish rock music

My fiance and I LOVE our sushi so we came on Yelp to find a nerby sushi place with a good happy hour. We didnt know this place had come under new management though, so they had gotten rid of their happy hour. It wasn't easy to spot. It's located right across the street from the Wigwam Resort & Spa. The surrounding area was beautiful. Trees lit up with lights on the street, tranquil neighboorhood. And the inside was just as wonderful. It looked a little upscale, the decor was pretty, even has a lounge area across the sushi bar, but still very laid back.  We showed up the night the new managment was taking over. The owner was there and was very attentive. The sushi chef was very knowledgeable and offered several recommendations. I ordered a specialty roll and he was happy to make it. It was delicious and fairly cheap. Only $9 for that special roll. The other rolls were a bit pricey, but well worth it. The quality was excellent.   The place was only about half full that night. Our food came out fairly quick since we were sitting at the sushi bar. The owner served complimentary sake shots for the house and we all toasted together. It felt like a very chill and welcoming place. The wait staff is very friendly. We've been back since our first time here and we haven't been disappointed yet.

I LOVE their froyo! It's about the only place in Phoenix where I can find green tea froyo. And it is out of this world! I love their other flavors here too because they are not as overly sweet as other froyo places. Their strawberry and chocolate are so flavorful and creamy. Love that they give you a stamp card, so you can accumulate them in order to get a free one on a future visit.

The Mr. and I love coming this local sports bar. The food and beer is always cheap. They had a really good menu with lots to chose from. Their buffalo shrimp and fried zucchinis are DELISH!! The buffalo chicken wrap is another favorite of mine. Service is always great and they have tons of screens to catch all the games. Definitely a favorite!

This is the mecca of meat lovers, my husband's "happy place", and the only place he will NEVER turn down even when he's beefed out!  With about 12 different meat options and a salad bar you better come hungry and take your time enjoying all the options before you fall quickly into a food trance. Sure its a bit pricey at $50 per person, but considering the quality of the meat is top notch and the huge all you can eat selection it's well worth it every once in a while! They have everything from filet mignon, to top and bottom sirloin, and my favorite, the lamb chops. Finger licking good! The salad bar is rather small compared to others I'm accustomed to, but the chicken and apple salad is memorable, as is the asparagus (which are BIG). Your meal is accompanied by mashed potatoes, plantains and polenta. These aren't anything to brag about, but who comes here to load up on carbs when you have all the meat to chose from. They also have a big wine room with a great selection.  I love that this is a Brazilian churrascaria that aims to look and serve authentic. The servers actually dress in authentic gaucho attire and most actually speak Portuguese! Last churrascaria I went to had caucasian servers who didn't speak a word of Portuguese or Spanish. Big points to Fogo de Chao! Like Sarah M. mentioned, the servers are always accessible but not overbearing. They give you a small discs at the start of the meal - green lets servers know to bring on the meat and red lets them know to move onto the next table. So you can always enjoy your meal at your own pace without feeling overwhelmed.  I love it!

My husband and I love bbq and this is the best we've had in AZ by far. I used to love Honey Bears since it was just a few blocks away from lunch hour at work, but since my husband intruduced me to this jem it has been our place to go for bbq. Forget Honey Bears, their sandwiches have NOTHING on Fritzi's!   Their open face pork sandwich is out of this world! The cole slaw is top notch. Their mac and cheese is nothing special but the baked beans are good. The ribs are excellent as well. Just fall off the bone!  If you are not bothered by the religious messages on display then you will like this place. I personally love that they are a Jesus loving mom and pop bbq joint! Makes me feel welcome every time. They are always super friendly when we visit. Definitely give it a try if you're in the area!

My husband and I had been having terrible luck finding a reputable limo company for our wedding day. We received some suggestions from friends, but all were rather disappointed with the service, so we were getting nervous.   I gave these guys a call after finding them on Yelp. I made the reservation thru Brett, who was extremely courteous. He offered us an older model stretch limo knowing we were on a tight budget. He even emailed us a few pictures of the limo and invited us to come out and look at it if we weren't entirely sure. It was last minute and we were desperate to find transportation for our wedding party since the reception was at a different location than the ceremony. We also hadn't been receiving great customer service from other limo companies and these guys really impressed us with their professionalism - and they gave us a GREAT deal, so we just couldn't pass!  They not only met our expectations, but they exceeded them! They really took great care of us from the point we made the reservation to our final drop off on the day of the wedding. The limo itself, though a few years older, was fabulous! If the older model looked that great I can't imagine how luxurious the new ones looked like. The driver was courteous and on time - my only complaint was that he did give us notice when he arrived for pickup (I noticed they were waiting outside when a relative rang the doorbell). But a complimentary bottle of champagne waiting in the limo after the ceremony for my husband and I made up for that. ;-) I'd definitely use their services again for another occassion!

My husband and I have been wanting to come to this place for some time since we moved right down the street from here. We were a little put off by the "no firearms" sign on the door, but after a long Monday we just wanted to watch some football, eat some seafood and grab a few cold ones. We came into this place and sat at the bar so we could watch some Monday Night Football on their flatscreens. We both ordered some fish tacos since it was their Monday special ($1.50) and split an order of "buffalo" shrimp. Shrimp was not the typical Red Hot buffalo style you'd expect. Instead they were loaded with other seasonings, but fairly decent. The fish tacos were delicious though! My husband claimed they were the best fish tacos he's ever had. We also ordered a barbacoa taco...and then another after having a taste...WOW! I didn't think I would ever say this in my life, but these tacos blew my mom's homemade ones out of the park! They were absolutely delicious! Drinks were cheap on happy hour. Bartender even offered me 2 drinks to make sure I could get them at happy hour price before it ended in the next 2 minutes.   We came back for their brunch buffet on Sunday. It was just okay. Not a whole lot of selection. I'd much rather stick to their menu. Overall - Good, friendly service, great food (on menu). Kick back, no trouble kind of ambience, although the sign outside makes u think otherwise.

I agree with others who have said about the broth being too oily and fatty. Noodles were fine, but I couldn't even finish half the bowl before I started getting grossed out and had to eat from my husband's bbq pork sandwhich instead, which was actually pretty decent. I'm a big carnivore, but even I thought the spring rolls lacked veggies, too much meat and pretty tasteless. Service was HORRIBLE! You're lucky if u can even get some eye contact with the service once your meal has been served. Soda was served straight from the can - no glass, not even a straw. Definitely not worth the 12 mile drive!

My favorite Target store! Not just saying that because it's only a 5 minute drive from my house. It never gets too crowded and the aisles are always well kept and organized. I hate walking into a Target and finding the layout complicated and the isles messy. The staff here is always friendly and care about the appearance of the store. Even the customer service section is always quick and problem free. Love it!

Was craving a torta very badly and the only other place nearby I know that served them was Tortas Paquime, but was never really impressed with that place. So, I decided to give this place a try. El Tri definitely knows how to pack them! I ordered 2 Arizona's to go and a quesadilla with the words. Quesadilla was so large they had to put it in a pizza size box! Tortilla was handmade and warm. Pretty tasty! Tortas were huge, I only ate half of mine, but my husband was able to finish his entirely...although, he dropped into a food coma just seconds after polishing off the whole thing! Will definitely come back and try another one of their sure to be delicious tortas.

LOVE, LOVE ZiNG!! The Mr and I had the BEST dining experience here last night since moving to AZ a few years ago...hell, it's probably the best dining experience we've both ever had ANYWHERE! James, the owner, really spoiled us and demonstrated what it's like to really shower your guests with not only an excellent dinner, but the nicest, friendliest, most attentive customer service. So with that said, here begins our tale of the most wonderful dining experience.  After reading the great reviews on Yelp we decided this would be our destination for the night. Upon arrival we we're cheerfuly welcomed by James and asked where we would like to sit. Strangely, the place wasn't all that busy for a Friday night so we had our choice between booths in the back, bar style tables in the front, or the bar. We went with the latter since we both felt a great vibe from James, who was also the bartender. Also, we both think it's easier to get a feel of the type of vibe from a new place by sitting at the bar. Right away we were demonstrated the friendliest customer servince. Firstly, James took our drink order. Miller for the Mr and he mixed up a Blue Hawaiian for me based on his suggestions. It was excellent, so smooth and delicious you couldn't even taste the alcohol, but you know it was in there bc I saw him pour it myself! Even though James would be our bartender and taking our food orders for the night, April, the quirky waitress came over to offer some assistence and make some recommendations. I loved the unique dinamic these two had. They were an excellent tag team!   Since we were first timers James procedeed to show us the menu and give us a run thru of their featured items along with there specials and most popular items. It was a tough choice, everything looked and sounded so good! A self-proclaimed spicy food's lover I went with the Diablo burger which featured a beef patty topped with chorizo, grilled jalapenos, tomato and lettuce (and I also added some grilled onions), served with sweet potato fries per request. The Mr went with the Philly Cheese Steak served with homemade potato chips. We couldn't resist the 4 types of mac-and-cheese so we ordered a cup of the Arizona.  While waiting for our food James asked where we had heard about them from and shared that it was wonderful Yelp that led us here. James was delighted to hear this! He appreciated the fact that we not only read their reviews on Yelp, but we actually followed thru by coming there even though we lived out in the West Valley. To show his appreciation he welcomed us by fixing up shots for each one of us - on the house! It was something along the lines of Adult Chocolate Milk and flavored vodkas. Whatever it was, it was delicious! All three of us cheered and before we knew it, our food was out.   It all smelled so delicious! April gave us some of their homemade Tiger Sauce to go along with the fries and chips (yes, the Charlie Sheen reference brought some laughter, and, yes, the sauce came before the blood according to James). Everything was excellent! The burger was so meaty and juicy. Not too much red, not too dry, it was perfect! I never would have thought to put chorizo in my burger and I'm so glad they did! The chorizo itself was a tad spicy and with the added jalapenos it was just the right amount of spicy. I added some of the tiger sauce as well and it gave it an even larger kick. Soooo good! The fries with the tiger sauce was a delight. It was the perfect pairing and offered the right amount of "zing". Took a bit from the Mr.'s Philly and chips and they were both excellent as well, but I think I prefered my burger. The mac and cheese was just as good. It also had chorizo so it gave the cheese a nice spicy kick. Noodles were perfectly cooked. All around a great meal!  Based on the food itself we were already sold and knew we would be back! But what further impressed us and made us self-proclaimed "ZiNG's bitches" was the excellent service James provided. I never ordered a drink off the top of my head. James took care of that for me by asking what type of drinks I liked and fixing up his own concoctions. They were all excellent. He even let me try something he mixed up for the table behind us by pouring me what remained in the shaker bottle. Everything he mixed was a delight! The cold beers for the Mr. kept coming before he was even finished with the last one. Anything we were curious to try but didn't want to order a full glass of, he would try it with us. I let the Mr. enjoy his straight scotch and whiskey, I'm not a fan. "WHAT, not a fan of straight alcohol you say"? Enter James w/ a sample of Chocolate Vodka. "Try it, you wouldn't even know ur drinking straight vodka!" he says. I LOVED it! And I LOVE ZiNG! We had such a great time by the end of the night James was sending us off with a "see you again soon friends" kind of hug. Don't be surprised to find us here during YOUR visit!

My husband and I were married here earlier this month. The stunning full pecan trees offered the perfect setting for our private wedding ceremony. All our guests commented how serene the location was and how it helped make the wedding so unique and beautiful. Everyone who helped us here was very professional. I wanted the perfect fall setting and brought many fall-like decorations, besides the red arbor drapping they provided, and didn't give them much direction, but told them to just do what they thought would look best. They decorated the place beautifully. Their prices weren't over the top like most other locations either. They were a great help making the ceremony run as smooth as possible as well. My husband and I were very pleased!

I was definitely expressed with their buffet! I had been craving Indian food for quite a while, but since it can be a bit expensive having to order all the dishes separately I was determined to find a place with a lunch buffet nearby to give it a try. I was lucky enough to find this place, which I noticed had fairly good reviews on Yelp. This place is definitely nicer and bigger compared to other Indian buffets I'd been to. It has a wide seating area and nicely arranged tables. The buffet had a great selection and I was able to try new dishes that I'd never tried before. Everything was delicious. Tandoori chicken was dry, but then again I've yet to experience it moist and juicy at a buffet. The garlic Naan bread was soft and warm, SO good! Service was excellent! Server was attentive and polite - my glass of water was never empty. Will definitely be coming back!

They didn't win Best Florists in the Valley for nothing! Barb was extremely helpful and professional. I had a pretty good idea of what kind of flowers I wanted for my wedding. I came into the shop knowing I wanted a professional florist to create my bridal bouquet and would just purchase flowers from another cheap florist to put my bridesmaids bouquets together myself in order to save some money. Barb offered great ideas on the bridesmaids bouquets for affordable prices. I was so pleased with her ideas and low prices I ended up ordering all my wedding flowers from them rather than making arrangements myself. They saved me the time, money and effort I would have otherwise put into it myself had I done it all DIY. Everyone there was so curteous. They even invited me to come in the day before my wedding to look at the flowers and make sure I was happy with everything. I wanted something very colorful and fall like for my bouquet and Barbara created the most beautiful bouquet. It turned out a lot better than I expected!   They are not limited to weddings either. They offer flower and arrangement delivery for special occassions as well. My husband, who is a romantic that sends me flowers quite often just because already has their number saved in his phone. I can't wait to receive another beautiful creation from them again! Truly a delight!
