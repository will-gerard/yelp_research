What a dissapointment this place turned out to be!!  New Years Eve seemed like a race to the finish line...reservations for 6:30 and after 2 appetizers, 2 entree's and a bottle of wine, with a second ordered, we were all but escourted to the bar to finish our wine. It was 7:06...yes, 36 minutes of fine dining!!!  what a joke, the food was overdone (PREPARED BEFORE WE EVEN ORDERED) and the service was like speed dating!!  I will never return to this "wanna be" great resteraunt...oh, and when the waiter realized a mistake on the bill (after we had paid and retired to the bar so he could quickly turn yet another table)  he came racing up to us to apologize for his oversite. yes, he needed more money  or it would come out of his tip!  I should have told him to slow down and maybe he wouldn't forget to charge for items ordered.  again, I will NEVER return to this chaotic  joke of a restaurant when there are so many wonderful places to dine.  Save your money (yes, our bill was over $200)  and enjoy yourself somewhere else!

Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon and the live music was a bonus!   The Funk 49 beer was light and delicious! The food.... YUM on absolutely EVERYTHING we ordered!!!    Lumpia... Basically an egg roll with spicy peanut sauce.  Delicious !!! Crab dip... Again,  yummy!!! Loaded Mac and cheese..  OMG !!!!! But the dessert......" Piece of cake".... SAVE ROOM!  It was fantastic! This will become a new favorite place!
