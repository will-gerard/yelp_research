Simply Amazing BBQ.  My Wife and I shared the BBQ Platter with our two young boys and we all were satisfied and loved the flavor for under $15.  And I had a cup of great coffee in that price.  Will certainly come back when we are in Gilbert.

Certainly the best take and bake  Pizza around. We love the ingredients and the thin crust is a healthy option as well. Friendly staff as always. I like it better than any of the other pizza joints around with the exception of Spinatos.

This place blows Starbucks out of the water!  Please check it out and support a local business keeping the $ here in the community and hiring your neighbors as employees. Oh, did I mention the coffee and breakfast burritos are great!!??

Good food. Wasteful packaging.  Busy place. I have come to love the Sausage and Egg sandwich. Add a fairly priced coffee regill in u own mug and you've got a great breakfast for under $9.

I've been coming here for 3years now and I have not once had a bad experience! I think wildflower strives to have excellent service and they pull it off. I am sorely going to miss this place when I move. Great coffee and great breakfast.

Skip it. I spent $13 in here on coffee and breakfast and they wouldn't give me a free refill on drip coffee that they are supposed to charge $  .50 for. I don't carry any cash and the two baristas just looked at me like. Sooo sad. Nothing we can do. That is the problem with today's culture of profitability.

I just found my new favorite thing about Phoenix!  -Cartel Coffee Lab- The coffee is stellar, the Barista is friendly and loves to share his art with us! I have notched this place permanently into my best experiences in Phoenix.

Great atmosphere and consistently good coffee!   I love that 10 percent of their sales go toward providing clean water for people living in 3rd world countries.  Certainly a great LOCAL alternative to Starbucks.

They now have fresh roasted coffee and the roaster knows what's up. He is creating new blends and truly knows good coffee. If you cities prior to the last 3 months, you might need to take another trip over, as the coffee is 100% better than the previous roaster. Al is a great guy who is willing to share about his passion of roasting great beans for taste and feel. Check it out!

I absoloutely love this place.  Great Coffee, Americanos, and Lattes.  Try the Chemex if you are looking for something unique.  Very Tasty Breakfast Burritos and friendly staff.  I wish the North Location was still open, but I'll take their brews anywhere I can get them.  Skip Starbucks and hit up a real coffee shop...

Outstanding breakfast burrito and Americanos. I will make this my only stop if I am in the area. Fresh cooked (not microwaved), fresh vegetables and eggs. Good portions and fantastic flavor. Please do try it, as I want this local spot to stay open for ever.  I even stop by for a mid-day Americanos because they are soo smooth and the barista pulls the shots just right. Keep it Local!

Came in at happy hour with my wife and 3 kids. We ordered a beer and several orders of rolls. Then.... Nothing for 45 minutes. We saw that it was busy, but about 30 minutes in I told the waitress that we needed to be somewhere in 15 minutes. She said she'd check on it. As we were getting up to leave she brought us the ticket and I told her that I would not pay full price for this and she said she'd see what she could do. Then she gave me 10% off. I told her that was unacceptable since we had no food and our kids had patiently waited too long already. The manager came out and said she could give me any more discount or else they'd not make any money. I told her that they had lost a customer and many more that I tell because the poor service and poor response to their mistake.
