Dr's here are terrific if you ever can get an appointment to see one.   Office is beautiful inside. But they probably should have invested the $$ in upgrading the office functionality.   Phone system in not user friendly..all robots and slim chance of getting human to ever answer phone.  Then she redirects u 2 voicemail even if it's within operational hours. U better be dying, hemorrhaging or in labor right now they just transfer u back into the voicemail system.   Posted hours  do not reflect actual hours of operation.   Need yr records sent to you or another Dr? Great! This office is trapped in the 80's and not technology friendly. To convey information and records the use fax, snail mail, and probably last owners of a typewriter. Unfortunately, making their turn around time REALLY slow. Online.. What's that? The whole office doesn't even have one email address.  Great Dr's if u ever get an appointment. 2 month waiting period average.

I have been boarding my 3 large dogs at Raintree for over 4 years now and I travel 2x a month. They are quite accommodating and I have never had a problem. One of my dogs can be quite nippy towards strange people and yet still there has never been any problems or illness.   The staff is younger but the they are well trained and they are always under direct supervision of experienced and seasoned management.  This resort can even accommodate one large kennels for all my dogs to stay together in just like at home. One other perk is they have a full sized pool for the dogs to swim in and they even cook the dogs kenneled over Thanksgiving turkey dinners.  I have no complains. Chris in management; she is truly a gem.

I've been a meet lover my entire life and tried eating at Green and was pleasantly surprise about how delicious everything was. I am especially fond of the apple, fig salad and the mock chicken wings. For a first timer it was delicious!  Well, worth the drive.

Worst wifi ever. On its best day it barely works. 3 months of weekly wifi complaints an Google wifi provider can't get it functional

Earl's I have eaten at on several different occasions. The lunch crowd is loud and noisy. The bar area is hoping in the evenings. Aside from that, the service is usually prompt and efficient. They have floor managers who check up on you often.  All around okay and the food is more than decent. No wifi is a bummer.

This place reminds me of a breakfast place my folks use to take us to back in New York called the Pancake House in Greenlawn, NY.  The food is delicious, and geared towards a healthy lifestyle. You can find all protein breakfasts too all veggie meals. They are very accommodating and polite. Sometimes there is a wait on Sunday morning because of the church going crowds.

This is one of my favorite lunch spots during the week. I personally bring a lot of clients here. Its trendy and the food and service are professional and accurate. Its also never gets packed during the day so the noise level is perfect for lunch meetings. Great atmosphere and there is wifi.   My personal favorite dish is the vegetable stuffed red peppers. There are many other terrific dishes as well.

Javinos has been in my long list of favorite North Scottsdale business lunch locations. The dark stone and sistine chapel reminiscent ceilings add to the old world charms and remind me of many NYC - area Italian restaurants. The food is terrific especially the stuffed peppers!   The other evening I met friends for a wine tasting there. For cost, the value was exceptional. It included a dinner plate sampling of several entrees as well as a complimentary wine pairing. The experience allowed for a briefing sampling of their other menu items and I was not displeased.  One negative, when seated in the center of the dinning room the acoustics are exceptional. You can hear everyone else's conversations at other dining tables. The down fall is you cannot hear the person sitting next to you. I'm assuming it is the result of the way the ceiling is shaped. Best idea when you want to grab a serious conversation of business negotiation aim for the seating closer to the walls. The food is delicious where ever you sit.  Eat well!

This location is always clean and the staff is friendly. I visit here when the truck is being serviced next door. The same team always seem to be working the front as well. Pristine both for food and experience!

Just delicious! Living in Keirland there isn't much to choose from that's on the vegetarian side. Fresh is a fun place with Asian/Vegan twist.   The food is fresh the whole menu caters to a healthy diet. I went withe the Eggplant and wasn't disappointed. I will be stopping back soon.

I'm a fan of both of these locations. It is my special stop for gluten-free pizza pickup. Many healthy allergy-friendly food solutions. The salads are also delicious! The staff is courteous and the place is always buzzing lunch and dinner time.

Could not even setup the first appointment with the front desk. Woman who answered the phone would not setup the first appointment without seeing my insurance cards which she would only accept via fax or fax from another doctor. Walking them in and mailing photocopies is not accepted. Emailing an image isn't even something they can accept.  All around the office is stuck in the 90's and unhelpful. The doctor maybe great and knowledgeable but your only as good as your idiot gatekeepers. Really wondering how they will be federally patient portal compliant by end of 2014.

I am a huge fan of Dunkin Donut's so I hesitate to share my secret new location with the world. This place has a drive through and being from New York a drive through dunkin donut's is unheard off makes this place a special treat!  The service okay. In general its fast food  and fast coffee.. don't go to the drive through expecting perfection.   I still love the coffee and it gets my mornings hoping so it's worth the trip.!

Artie may be great at what he does as over reviewers dictate but lacks a certain professionalism unfortunately.   I found Artie on Yelp with great reviews, spoke with him over the phone and described the extend of damage and the approved leak as per water company in units per hour. (The water company has taken almost a year to determine the specific leak. It's two quarts an hour from my copper water main.) After inviting him to the property he only quoted over the phone with no visuals.  I specifically noted this detailed quote needed to be submitted to the insurance company. I received a loosely hand written quote that was labeled "pipe and cost". As to size of pipe and length, or allowing for multiple leaks, we will never know. After contacting Artie again detailing the insurance company would never pay on this over simplified proposal and I needed more detail I never heard from him again.    I requested a second quote to replace the shutoff value to the house from the water main line and that just never happened.   So we never got to the "service" part of the process. Good luck getting there!

A fan of Fletcher's Auto but love the educated mechanics on staff there! They really know their stuff. Occasionally they are short staffed, but they always get the job done right with the correct part.

The team there really takes the time to fix things right the first time.  This is not "quick" repair place, give them the time they need to repair it right the first time... So many impatient people reviews here

My A/C went down last night and late on a Friday night with a Saturday looking to hit 107 degrees. Peak season and peak heat = ugh!  I called several A/c companies booking 2 weeks out and over burdened by the need currently Roman of Petro Mechanical came out within an hour early on a Saturday morning. He examined the unit and concluded my capacitor was on it's last legs. He replaced it and even stayed long enough to test the temperature of the A/C in the house.  I was impressed because too many times local AZ service companies all try to "up-sell" me into something I don't need. Roman was efficient and actually educated me on what possible solutions might  be the cause of my lack of cool air problem.   When I finally choose to replace my classic A/C model from 1983 I will think of Petro Mechanical for that project.

I have no history with this Dr. I was trying to setup a new appointment for some general testing. The appointment was suppose to be in two days. In order to set up the appointment they required a credit card on file to bill you at full cost (+$100) if you don't show up.  Pass.   I would understand if I had a history of not showing up for appointments but I don't.

This is by far the most success I have ever had with one gym. The trainer Tim Deloch is amazing! The workouts combine a hybrid of Crossfit & TRX training over a one hour period.  Additionally, it a great positive group of individuals. Let's face it everyone has busy days and eating is something we think of last, and it affects our energy and lifestyle. This gym is really supportive as a group. Lots of fun people just trying to stay healthy!   I like this gym because it covers, nutrition, fitness training and the support of attendees and trainers is out standing!  Use referral code # 132068:  for a free week OR try their 30 Day Fit Challenge. (That is how I got started.)
