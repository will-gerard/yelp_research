Was told the replacement for my standard front brake maintenance would take about 45 min.  3 hours later I am still waiting and writing this review. They didn't have the part in stock and than the wrong part was ordered. They offered a free oil change in the future which means I have to come back to use the "we are sorry" voucher, should have offered something while my car is on blocks waiting to be finished. I don't plan on using their services again after this unprofessional fiasco.

The food was full of flavor, good size portions and reasonable price. They also serve a small salad and soup once you sit down and provide a free fruit dessert. I can't wait to come back again.
