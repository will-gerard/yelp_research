I live right down the street and have been to Switch many times. I've always had a great experience. The servers and hosts are very kind. I usually get the Breakfast Galette, but everything else that I've tried on the menu is delicious.   What I like about this restaurant is that it seems to have a great training process. I'm an indecisive person. So when it comes to choosing an entree, nothing is more frustrating when the server can't tell me how it tastes or if he/she likes it. I've never had that issue at Switch. Anything I ask about, they can tell me what it's like, to help me make my decision.

This was my friend's first time eating here. We walked in about 30 minutes to close when two employees, not paying attention to the door, were cleaning the grill. My friend ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwich. The employee told him he just put that stuff away. Which makes sense that he didn't want to re-clean the grill. So he reluctantly ordered a cold sub as anything hot would require re-dirtying the grill.  It's a shame that that he wasn't able to get the sandwich he really wanted because the workers were obviously trying to be out the door the minute they close. He will probably not be back.

Fantastic venue!  I think Clever Koi is a great fusion of Asian cuisine. I attended the soft opening. It was busy as expected. There are a few kinks to work out as this is a new concept. But the food was great. I ordered the kimchi fried rice with seafood sausage.   My drink was also wonderful with hints of ginger and a beautiful garnish.   Our server was very kind. The restaurant has nowhere to go but up and the server believed this with great conviction.
