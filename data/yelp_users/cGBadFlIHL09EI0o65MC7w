I've been a client of Justin's for over 10 years. He's a great citizen of the Anthem community and he and his staff are top notch. I have auto, home, and my kid's 529 college funds with State Farm and I've never had a single problem.

I love the crew here ! Manager Lisa S. Is always good for a laugh and most the staff no what I'm ordering as soon as I step through the door. Lots of friendly familiar faces makes it seem more like a small town hangout than a huge chain. My only criticism is that i wish they would bring back the old pumpkin scone. That rocked!

It is what it is. If you are on a budget and looking for a get away, it's an ok place for a "staycation". If you see the name Hilton, and think you'll be staying at more than a mid-level hotel, you'll be disappointed.   The lazy river/pool was kind of crowded, and not very clean or updated. To be fair, it wasn't terrible but not that appealing. Unless you hit the lazy river on a very slow day, anticipate and unrelaxing float. I have kids, love kids, but don't enjoy getting smacked into every 30 seconds. Kind of harshes the mellow.  The "Hole in the Wall" restaurant was pretty terrible, ordered five meals and should have sent three back, but only one was completely inedible... That was the "chicken tenders". The fowl chosen for these tenders must have lived in the desert and had limited access to water and moisturizer. The macaroni & cheese floated in a half inch of butter/oil. In hindsight, I should have mashed the chicken & Mac together to equalize the moisture disparity.  The rooms were better than a motel but not by a whole bunch.  Our first room smell like a cucumber melon plug-in blew up, and the room we were moved to had a broken fridge and a loud a/c. Everything else worked and the bed was pretty comfortable, so all in all, not that bad, but again, "Hilton"?  Since I'm a bit of a hotel snob, I likely won't be back.

I just love this place. The food is consistently good, the service is always friendly and fast , and the prices are reasonable. I like that I can order my meal super spicy and my wife can be wimpy! Brown rice is always can option and their brewed ice teas are yummy. Always a hit with my family!

As a Realtor, I depend on the quality and professionalism of the trades I refer. Bullfrog has proven over the years that they are a top-notch company. I've received nothing but rave reviews from my clients and over the past 8 years I've used their service several times at my home and properties I own. Nothing but great service and fair prices each and every time!
