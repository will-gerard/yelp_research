DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE!!! I wish I could give negative stars! I spend $2k at this place and got my car back with a NEW issue. Then I took it back and then did some more work, said it was fixed, i went to get it and it had the same issue. I then had to take it to a different place to get it fixed.

DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE! They took two days to "fix" a problem for me. I got my car back and the issue was not resolved. I also have a new issue now. Now it having trouble starting. :( I wish i could give negative stars.

Check all your items before you pay. I have gotten many items back with wrinkles ironed into them.  The only reason I take my shirts here is to have them pressed as I HATE ironing.  If I have to double check the work of a professional service then they are not worth my time.  BOTTOM LINE: Find another cleaner!!!
