Irregardless of the Chilis we go to the food is delicious, hot, & the staff are always very pleasant! Guac. Is def. fresh! I really don't know why Applebee's is still in business with Chilis in business! Btw the guac. Burger & sweet potato fries is the business!!!!

Five stars because of the costumer service. They work well with your needs and strive to provide an affordable package that meets your requirements. Pretty clean and great discounts on products for their members. There are lots of tanning places to choose from, but I definitely choose this place because of the costumer service.

Took too long to be seated, if it weren't for another waitress who took our drink order im sure we'd still be waiting for them to figure out what tables they have. The sad part is they aren't busy. Well, I have a discount for this meal so I can't really complain to much, it is the only reason I am here. At least the waitress is reasonably pleasant. Hopefully the food is up to par. Slow service at this time of night so be prepared. Nice people though. Food decent but good staff

The food is not bad, however the service makes it difficult to want to return...every time I have have come here it takes me grabbing a staff member to even get a drink. The food is decent though, so I return. Happy hour menu is full of great prices and appetizers which is typically what I order anyway. If they could get a little more organized as far as staff goes it would go far. I also would love seaweed in my miso please lol patience required to dine here. Overall, I shall return!

I found a worm in my shiitake kale chicken! Never again...they actually asked if I'd like another plate...i loved this place till then. Check your produce. Tells me they don't wash before they store.

This place is slow...geographically this place would thrive in another area BUT the chicken fried rice is the best I probably have ever had! The price is absolutely right as well! I wouldn't get the sushi because it is not as cold as I would like but the entrees are perfect. Also, the happy hour menu is HUGE...3-close! Nice little quiet spot for a date  merry Christmas...
