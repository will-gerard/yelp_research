ah-so japanese? more like "ah-so delicious"!!!!!!  (if that doesnt earn me a "cool" or "funny" rating, then i dont know what will!)  anyways, one of my hobbies is eating teppanyaki and sushi. not normally in gilbert but i was in the area the other night and wanted some teppan.  maybe the best teppan yet? good prices, delicious filet & scallops, and they actually start cooking the fried rice first! i dont know what some of these other restaurants are thinking when they start making this part last . . . only negative is, no chicken and hardly any veggies in the fried rice but it came free with the meal!  had a vegas roll and it also was delicious. i liked that they spaced out the sushi/soup/salad/entree so they didnt overlap and gave us time to relax and drink sake in between.   the chef was great. funny and personable (and actually asian, which is a rare thing at these restaurants nowadays) he flipped shrimp at us and drank sake with us after. there was another chef who was white who did not look like nearly as much fun cooking for other tables . . . so much so that i actually remarked "i hope we dont get that guy as our chef."  tons of food, go hungry!

ok, so i went back here and had a better experience. they remembered to bring the soup and salad before the meals.  and my buddys gf came with and we got sat at a table with some other people who were pretty cool. it wasnt as awkward as when just my friend and i were sitting alone at a table with no soup or salad.  the soup sucks though, its like 99 parts water to 1 part chicken broth.  the best part of this restaurant is the cooks. both times we had this cat named yoshi (make sure you ask him about mario and luigi, he loves that!) the cooks have fun and interact with you. he even had us play a drinking game where every time he put butter on the food on you had to drink. he even was trying some new "experimental" tricks.   one of the most fun teppan restaurants i have been to!  except put my damn fried rice in a bowl!!!!! its way to hard to eat rice off a plate with chopsticks

this review is in regards to the smoothie/coffee bar only (we all already know how stereotypically yuppie, over-priced and full-of-itself the grocery store part is (and especially the customers; ), though they do have awesome stuff you cant find anywhere else, so i guess they can charge a premium and i will shop here for those specialty/natural items)  anyways . . . the smoothie/coffee bar . . .   in recent purchases, tried some of their iced coffee and a mocha latte. the coffee is terrible. its bitter and has a funky aftertaste. the mocha had so much mocha flavoring it was like drinking syrup but you could still taste the over-brewed, stale coffee! on a positive, they do offer almond milk (which is far superior to soy milk in flavor and consistency) along with a few other alternative milks.  on to my smoothie experience . . . terrible. $5 for a small and i had them remake the first one and couldnt even drink the second one. initially, i asked for peanut butter and they put almost a racquetball-size scoop in (thats like 1/3 to 1/2 of the smoothie!). i love peanut butter. but this was so much peanut butter, i had to chew the smoothie and almost needed an epi-pen, even though im not necessarily allergic to pb in "normal" doses.   so i asked them to remake it without pb. but that was after i stood there while the two girls talked (well, one talked, the other just stood there pretending not to notice me) to some lady about who knows what for a few minutes before even acknowledging me.   and on another note, i know "the kids these days" are all into dubstep music . . . but if you are listening to this type of music blasting through some crappy speakers, it sounds like crap! i used to go to parties, albeit back in the day literally before dubstep was created and all we had was some dnb and jungle music, so i can appreciate some good, bowel-shaking bass and electronic music, but you need decent speakers, otherwise it sounds terrible, like the music the workers had blasting through crappy speakers behind the counter. i was about to get anxiety or epilepsy or something from it.  so the next smoothie they made me was undrinkable also, but i didnt feel like returning it. we figured out they must have used some super-under-ripe bananas in it. was it payback? retribution? im sorry i insulted your inability to balance flavors by suggesting that a smoothie half full of peanut butter was not a pleasant culinary experience.  so yeah, i make smoothies almost daily at home and they are far superior, so ill stick to that. its not brain surgery, just act like you give a shit about the food you are making me.

i was hesitant about the change but gave it a shot. you can still do the "make your own salad" bar with some soups and the same mac n cheese they used to have.   but you can also do a fancy-pants salad. i got the california cobb. they mixed it and it didnt get served with those cool stripes of ingredients . . . but it did have this awesome chunky shredded turkey that they now roast on site. honestly tasted like really good thanksgiving turkey when you eat it the next day. and this salad was, i think, cheaper than the old sweet tomatoes salad bar.   didnt get to try any deserts though.   biggest complaint was that i wish they woulda given me an actual cup for water, not some rinky-dink 6oz plastic thing.

the only redeeming quality is their driving range, otherwise they would only get ONE STAR. it has a bunch of different "targets" to shoot at and is better than just a standard flat range.  other than that, STAY AWAY!!!!  the interior smells absolutely disgusting. the few times i went it smelled the same so it wasnt just some isolated incident like a sewage leak or dead animal.  WORST MINI-GOLF course ever! every hole is flat and as boring as playing in my kitchen. the astroturf is all ripped up and even the cement around the holes is crumbling.   i commend the yelper below who was able to take one for the team and try their food, something i couldnt even imagine making my ex-gf do. anyways, thats beside the point. on the other hand, maybe he has a screw loose for even attempting the food here.   i had to go home and take two showers after spending some time here.

this place is awesome. been here a few times for lunch. consistently good, tastes like they use good-quality ingredients, i dont feel heavy or bloated afterwards. the shrimps are always cooked to a perfect texture.  adorable little bungalow-looking joint, you can tell its a family-run affair.

as a kid, i remember going to sbarro in the malls back in illinois. even as a teenager, we would still hit up sbarro. i remember the pizza being huge slices of super thin, delicious, greasy pizza.  i dont know what happened. the gf and i were at fashion square and i thought i could relive my youth.  i could not have been more wrong. talk about garbage pizza. i had a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni. the pizza tasted and looked like it was just a reheated, frozen pizza. the crust sucked, the slice was small with a thicker crust, the sauce tasted like sweet artificiality. and not "sweet" as in "good," "sweet" as in too much sugar." and the cheese congealed in about 30 secs to a weird, fake cheese consistency.  they also had other italian entrees sitting in the trays, but these looked like they had been sitting in the same spot since the mall opened that morning.  the gf made fun of me when i said i was going to yelp the sbarros at the mall . . . but i want to save anyone else from having their teenage mall memories drowned in gross tomato sauce and crappy crust.

i eat a lot of sushi and teppan. this is one of, if not the best sushi/teppanyaki joint in phx.  the sushi is meaty and delicious and well-priced. not fishy tasting at all ("fishy" means "not fresh"). the only negative is their selection is lacking a bit.  the teppanyaki may be the best of any places i have been to. soup and salad come with the meal. the soup is not miso soup and i dont really care for it. the salad on the other hand . . . best citrus-ginger dressing of any japanese restaurant. the filet is seriously like butter. only thing is, there is no filet + scallops combo -- you have to get the ny strip to get the combo. i suppose you can ask but i didnt. the only other negative is that they do not make the fried rice at your table, they just bring you a bowl of it from the kitchen. come on, thats part of the draw of teppan!  also, their lunch is amazing! for less than $4, you get a box lunch with entree/meat, salad, rice and orange slices. best deal in scottsdale. wish i still worked across the street.

green is great. im not even vegetarian and i like it. a lot.  the rice bowls . . . eh, i think i have had them once or twice.  my favorite is the argentine po-boy and the buffalo chicken wings are the bomb.   great angle to try and attract non-veggies to eat vegan/veggie food. they have "normal," fried, "unhealthy" food. honestly, you wouldnt even know you are eating hippie food.   and make sure you get a tsoynami for desert. its like a blizzard made with house-made soy ice cream. they have like 20 flavors (different combos of mix-ins, like). but you probably want to split one becasue they are pretty big and filling, esp after you eat some buffalo chicken wings, and share some salad and a sammich.  oh yeah, i tried the pesto pizza once before and wasnt too impressed.

they microwaved my croissant on a Styrofoam plate. when I told the child working there that's unacceptable, she reacted like I was trying to explain theoretical physics in Cantonese.   I will not eat food microwaved on Styrofoam. I didn't realize that was some secret thing no one but me knows is bad for you.

ive eaten here and to-go, for both dinner and lunch.  their meatball parm and chicken parm sammiches are awesome! and the lunch deal is a great value . . . you get the sammy, chips and a drink for like six or seven bucks.  the best thing about this place is the bread. they give you a mini loaf with your pasta dish and they serve the sammiches on it. seriously, it might be the best bread ever!  the pasta dishes here are also delish. they even do some interesting things like pesto-based raviolis topped with marinara. sounds weird but really good. also had an excellent veal dish here.  the white pizza is also i go-to fav. i havent had the red sauce pizza but i love the white. i think they only do that to go, though.  great local business to support. consistently good food.

dont waste your time or money here.  i purchased a returned/slightly-cosmetically damaged fridge here.   the sale sticker said i was saving like over 30% of the retail price.  after i had the fridge delivered (both the fridge and my walls were damaged by the delivery guys), it is not working and i have to wait over week to get a repair guy out to look at it.  i just looked up the same model on sears.com, and it is only $50 more to buy it new!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i would gladly have paid $50 more to get a brand new fridge. stupid me for thinking this store was honest.

usually, just thinking about drinking a margarita gives me heartburn. that canned sweet-n-sour mix or whatever sucks big time. im glad to report, the margaritas here are the shiznit! they come in a really small glass but are super tasty, strong and cheap (during happy hour).  the salsa bar is good but all of their salsas are pretty hot. usually the salsa verde is not hot only tasty, but here it is one of the hottest ones. i figured out the radishes help distill the heat afterwords, though, fyi.  the mahi tacos are rather bland, but the others are good. i also like how they have melted cheese in between the two tortillas. gf said the shrimp tacos are delish - ill have to try those next time.

the coffee here is really bitter and burnt-tasting. i guess that weeds out people who arent "cool enough" to go here.   if you are into style over substance, than you might love this place!

a few years ago, a couple hawaiian friends of mine introduced me to the glory known as a boxed lunch. this would be some meat on some steamed cabbage, two scoops of rice and a scoop of macaroni salad. i have since eaten at probably all of the local hawaiian joints, even ones that are now closed. i always get the chicken katsu + terriyaki/bbq combo plates.  this place gets a big "meh." my major complaint is that they totally skimp you on the rice. c'mon, that has to be the cheapest ingredient a restaurant can buy! they only give you one solitary scoop and you totally run out before you finish all the meat. although since their mac salad is not very good, i order a  extra scoop of rice instead of the mac (plus, the scoops are tiny little scoops too)  the katsu is good, although the sauce is . . . actually, the sauce used to be all funky and sweet, but today it seemed a bit better.  the bbq chicken is a bit fatty but not too greasy. the teri sauce is kinda weird.  also, the cabbage is not even steamed, so its not very good to even eat a few bites of (im not a cabbage fan, but sometimes a bite or two goes with some katsu nicely)  cant comment on the boba tea, since tea is my mortal enemy of beverages . . . but if i did drink tea, i would drink boba tea!

not normally in this area but was looking for some teppanyaki.  all the reviews here talked about the service, not the food. so i thought i would check it out anyways.  literally the worst teppan restaurant i have been to.  first impressions . . . the table was all sticky and the corner was taped together but the tape came unstuck so this piece of table was just hanging off.   the shrimp appetizers were overcooked and chewy. there were a couple filets and strip steaks ordered. i ordered the filet and when he served me, he gave me the skinny little steak that i thought was the strip while cooking. after comparison taste testing, the filets were the thin little steaks (maybe 3 oz.?) and the strips were the nice looking ones.  also, biggest complaint of the meal . . . the fried rice. the chef didnt start cooking it until after we were almost done eating the rest of the meal (meat and veggies). i like to eat rice WITH the meal, not get a pile of it at the end. there were hardly any veggies in the rice, and no chicken, just eggs. also, most of the rice was still crunchy and not fully cooked.  the mustard sauce (and i guess ginger too) is one of the best parts of the meal. their sauces just plain lacked flavor.  i did like the scallops though. but they were kinda cold by the time i even got veggies to eat with them (not to mention no rice!)

went here to watch the ufc fights. there was no cover charge and it wasnt packed full of affliction-wearing douche canoes. lots of tvs. so those are pluses.   the service . . . pretty dismal. ok, it was a big fight night but i think they only had two waitresses working. the girl we had looked overwhelmed, and like i said, it wasnt that packed. there were still a couple open tables after the fights started, which did fill up eventually. im sure it easily gets busier for football games and such every week. we didnt see the waitress for stretches at a time, she would randomly show up every so often with one item we had previously ordered but woudnt take any new orders until the next time she would visit without any items.   they were also out of a couple of their more decent drafts. we didnt get any napkins or silverware, and our paper towel roll dispenser on the table was empty. when the waitress would come by, she would have to move it to put stuff down, and still wouldnt give us paper towels.  the food was a serious joke, bordering on insulting. my friend ordered the new york strip steak (yes, i had that same reaction when i heard he ordered that). it looked pretty sad sitting on the plate when it did come. he cut into it and it was raw. im not talking under-cooked, im saying literally raw. if you looked at the side of the steak, you could see raw steak. we grill quite a bit, so im kinda familiar with steaks, and this had to have been one minute on super high heat on each side. no exaggeration.   so the waitress comes by on her next go round, and my friend tells her about the steak. she didnt give a shit. so my friend said he would get something else.  so then she comes by a round or two later with my buffalo chicken sandwich. i literally laughed at it. at first i thought they forgot the chicken . . . but when i took the top bun off, there it was. a perfectly circular chicken patty about 1/4" thick. smothered in sauce. there was close to 1/2" of bun around the chicken patty and the edge of the bun. they politely included two small slices of tomato. they were both from the top of the tomato and had the white centers in still in them. i decided not to use the tomato that was partially green.  the waffle fries were so awesome. actually, more like a love-hate relationship. after eating about half of them though, the overwhelming saltiness that made them so good started burning my mouth.  so then the waitress comes by and my friend ordered the philly cheese steak, which he said was pretty good.

first time i ate here, they gave me chicken when i ordered beef. i had taken it to go so nothing i could do.  just ate here again for lunch, now i feel . . . kinda high or drunk or something. almost hallucinogenic . . . and not in a good way. though the toilet did just help me feel better.

pick a pasta. pick a sauce. pick a cheese. delicious.  i even wanted to buy some of the fresh, refrigerated pasta to take home but the owner advised me against it since i had some other errands and the pasta would sit in my car to long. THANKS and good looking out -- most places would just want to sell you as much stuff as they could, regardless of how fresh it would stay.

i have been here for, well, B, L & D.   i like this place. their menu is rather diverse with a bunch of things that look really good. sometimes you go these newer restaurants and they have a very limited menu, or the selection on the menu is just to weird.   the breakfast was good and i am def open to trying more items. had the pork tostada, which was a bit overwhelming but really good if you are into a more "mexican-y bfast."  for lunch, i had a sammich. good amount of meat. nothing totally outstanding but still a solid offering.  for my dinner trip, i went during happy hour and had a burger with sweet potato fries. both were awesome. the med-rare burger could have used another 45 seconds on the grill; it was still a bit too red inside. the sweet pot fries were excellent, some of the best of this "new" trend.   their happy hour is really good, too. $3 beers and a good selection of cheap apps.  i think they may have gotten a new chef somewhat recently so i hear the food has been on the upswing.

2 stars because they have a ton of great beers, and they are all not crappy, over-hopped hipster beers!  give them 1 star for food. overpriced and under-flavored.   go here to drink, not eat.  others in the group said their wings were good, but the rest of the food was not.

awesome, fast and intelligent service.  these guys installed a new ssd in my macbook pro. stopped in on friday evening and they had it ready that same night! dude at the counter even gave me some references and links he looked up when i told him i was having RAM issues (sort of unrelated to the ssd install they did)  super helpful, seemed to actually care about what they are doing.

this has been a pretty good lunch spot near my work. but after  the last few times, I probably won't be coming back.   I always get an El pastor burrito, and every time (but once), and especially today, the burrito is half delicious El pastor, and half black crunchy prices of charcoal. I think those are actually burnt scraps of El poster scrapped off the floor or from behind the grill, but they still taste like crap.

after trying to get an eye exam here three times (every time i stopped in or called, they said the doctor had gone home early), i finally got one done.  after checking to make sure they took my insurance, i asked them multiple times to make sure i would not be required to pay any out-of-pocket fees for anything. after that was all cleared up, i went into the eye exam.  first off, the exam chair was way off-center from the board you read letters off. i asked about this and they said to just sit on an angle. i generally expect an eye exam to have some sort of exactness to it?  so after the exam, they told me i owed all this money. when i told them that was not what my insurance told me, i called my insurance. my insurance told me that this doctor is not "in network."   oh, while i was on the call, i noticed the sign by the front door stating accepted insurance plans . . . i saw my insurance written with sharpie at the very bottom.  WHY DONT I EVER NOTICE WARNING SIGNS FIRST?!? (haha, this was literally a warning sign)  so i told my insurance i refused to pay this doctors fees and they made some notes and said that was fine.  while i was on the call in the middle of the doctors office (awkward, right?), i saw the doctor take my paper, crumple it up and throw it in the trash all exasperatedly.    so i told them i wasnt happy being duped and wouldnt pay. the doc then said he would still bill my insurance because  "he deserved to be compensated for his time." i asked him "what about my time you wasted here?"

unfortunately for this place, their food is pretty good but their prices are OUTRAGEOUS!!!   I ordered the quesadilla de maiz w Carne asada and a water. she asked if I wanted some crumbled cheese and a drizzle of sour cream on top so i said sure. then I asked for a bit of guacamole on the side (seriously, "a bit" - it only lasted for half my quesadilla).   my bill was OVER $15  i almost ordered a horchata but she said a glass of that was $5!!!  like I said, pretty good food but ludicrous prices. I will not be going back for this reason. I hope you enjoyed the extra few dollars you charged this one visit instead of having a return customer who would have brought an extra person back, possibly a couple times.
