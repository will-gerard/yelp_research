OMG!!  I went in to this Burger King thinking I was going to enjoy a quick bite.  Instead, I was ripped off.  I had chosen my meal from the menu and ordered it.  Silly me I thought the price on the menu board was the price I would be charged.  No!  Apparently you need to specify what size meal you want or the employees of this place are instructed to automatically charge you for the biggest size they offer!! outrageous!!!!  Stay away from any and all Burger King's, especially this one!!!

Wow. We really like this place a lot, especially the stir fry!  My wife gets nothing else. I have had about half of the items on the menu and have enjoyed each. My new favorite is the honey chicken. The house fried rice is full of veggies and meat, it's a meal in itself. The owners/staff are so sweet and friendly to boot and always make us feel welcomed, especially our 2 year old daughter. The husband/owner always makes a point of offering her a fortune cookie right away and she loves the attention. I kind of don't want to write how much we like this place for fear others will start going and we will not be able to get in, so don't go! .

I've been here 20+ times in the last year as my wife really likes it. Their pizza is good and they have several interesting non-traditional offerings.  We really like that they use organic and non gmo  ingredients in their offerings. That being said, I'm not sure I can continue to get pizza from here.   I've noticed over the last several months that the service and especially the attitudes of the employees is becoming worse and on occasion somewhat hostile. Tonight was the final straw for me. I was told my order would be ready for pickup between 20-60 minutes. When I arrived after 30 min, it was ready and the girl almost threw it to me across the register. I asked for the salad the id ordered as well and she looked at me as if I had three heads. Reluctantly she walked the three feet and got my salad too. The entire experience tonight put such a horrible taste in my mouth that I can no longer recommend Z Pizza to anyone!

It seems like I got caught in some transitional pains. My wife and I will be going back soon and will update review at that time. Really appreciated Brian calling me and am looking forward to seeing the improved ZPizza!  EDIT2:  We went back last week. Night and day difference!!  Spoke with Keegan on the phone who was incredibly pleasant and friendly. When I arrived to pick up my order, the bearded man who makes pizza greeted me and was friendly too. He actually looked happy to be there. The young lady who was cashier that night was still standoffish at first but slowly warmed to polite conversation. Such an improvement.   Brian, you are doing a great job in turning this place around. I feel I can recommend your restaurant again.

Hooray! A new place to eat great food!  How can you not want that?  I had the god fortune to get t watch this diner built from the get go.  I have gotten to know the managers and the staff, all of which rock.  These guys are doing an amazing job.  I had never eaten at a Pei Wei prior to this one opening and have to say I'm now hooked!!  I have tried almost everything on the menu and have yet to find something that I didn[t like.  The food is always hot and fresh and ready when they tell me it will be.  Parking is a bit of a problem, but with Starbucks Coffee literally right next door, it's worth the trouble.  This place definately puts yummy in your tummy!!

This store is brand new,  just opened this past Sunday!!  It is right on the edge of the F Q Story historical district.    The store has a more traditional coffee house feel than other Starbucks have.  With the exposed red brick and the open cubbies for storing the syrups, cups and saucers it, the store really says "Come in and stay awhile".   There's is a nice sitting area with two home style chairs and a chaise lounge.  The patio is inviting with a quite grassy area and many trees.  In just a few months, this is going to be the place to hang out and enjoy life!!
