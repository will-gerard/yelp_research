It has a nice place that I can recommend to my friends who needs to drink and to unwind. To eat and to relax. The food is good. Personally, I love Autostrada Panini.

A beautiful drive up and also a fantastic city view from the major from the mountain. Terrific hiking trails. What I love more is the sunset and the full view at night! Perfect experience!

I don't want to be the last person to taste this Amazing Rehab Burger. After I read all the cool damn reviews here. I can't wait any longer... Before the month ended last September at last we came here with my friends. Wow, this is the giant and coolest burger I've ever tried! Nacho Taco Burger is the best!

Once in a while I give myself a time to drink and night life, and I finally I found one of the places that I can hang out with my friends to have a good night weekend!   I love the ambiance, the atmosphere was not too loud, very nice outdoor patio.  Tamales $3.50 - Thumbs up!  And lastly, what I like here they called it Happy hour. Cool!!!  HAPPY HOUR  Everyday 4pm-7pm $1 Off All Draft Wine $1 Off All Draft Beer $6 Whisky Mules $5 Bruschetta $5 Hummus
