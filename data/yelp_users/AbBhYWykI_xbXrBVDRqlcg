I've given this place multiple chances but every time I'm disappointed. They either don't get a stain out I specifically point out to the clerk when dropping off (said stain is not marked like they do at most places) then proceed to still charge me for the item without letting me know they weren't able to get it out OR put a little hang tag on the item saying a stain was not able to be removed and give me the item back in worse wrinkled condition then when I dropped it off, all while still charging me!!! Will not be returning, no matter how cheap or conveniently located they are to my house.

This place honestly doesn't understand the concept of service. After being ignored and disrespected by our server we got up to leave, upon seeing the owner on leaving wanted to let him know about WHAT A HORRIBLE EMPLOYEE HE HAS, he continued to tell us we were NOT respected, too young to have an opinion (mind you my friend speaking is 29). Nice try bro, we have corporate credit cards, you messed up with your age profiling. missed out on an unlimited budget *tisk *tisk douche

I have alwasy been a huge fan of Nordstrom Rack but Last Chance is on a whoooole new level of bargain shopping. Great deals and designers but you have to be willing to dig to find the great stuff.
