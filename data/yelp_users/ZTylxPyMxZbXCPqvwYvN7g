All I can say is if you go, DON'T RUN A TAB!!! I was charged an extra 30 dollars on my credit card, so I called to speak to a manager.  The owner called a few days later, I explained the situation, he said he needed to call me back and when he did he told me the bartender told him what I had and it all added up correctly.   I told him I did not have all of that and what I did have, the bartender told me he was giving me a certain price and he was charging me more than promised.  He said, well the bartender doesn't have the authority to change drink prices and as far as what I had, he would call me back (again).  I still have yet to hear from him.

This place is amazing.   The front desk clerk was very efficient and friendly and the manager was right there working next to him equally cheery and helpful.   The room was absolutely beautiful and very clean.  Refrigerator, cabinets, stove, microwave and flat screen t.v.'s to boot.  The laundry room, exercise room  and snack and beverage room were all very clean and easy to find.  Very well kept and we'll run place.  I highly recommend it to anyone needing it for travel or even a mini vacation.
