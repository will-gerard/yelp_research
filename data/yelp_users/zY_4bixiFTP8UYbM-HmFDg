I bought my house in September of 2015.  The old owner had language in the home sale paperwork that required me to take on the home security contract that he had already signed up for, which was no big deal and I was happy to do it.    I called today to try and have my service canceled starting September of 2016, only to be informed I was locked into a NEW 3 year contract, from my initial date of September 2015.  The security system was already installed, they didn't have to do anything besides  TRANSFER the contract, however they swindled me into signing a NEW contract.  Never once did the sales associate verbally explain the terms or the length of the servicing agreement.    Yes, I should have read the fine print.  Yes, I should have confirmed there was not a new multi-year contract.  None the less, there is something to be said for a company that would rather slip something past you, besides being upfront an honest with you.  This is not the way an honest company does honest business.  They may legally be in the right and I understand the need for them to recoup their costs (which I am 100% behind and agree with), but when you strategically sign someone up for a new multi-year contract, instead of just having them takeover the current contract, that is just unethical.

Fantastic experience for lunch here today.  Their sandwiches and flatbreads were amazing.  To be honest though, it was the amazing customer service that was provided that made the experience 5 star worthy.  My drink was never empty, and they were extremely acomodating.  I will be going back 100 more times because of how pleased I am.

Great Chinese food and a great happy hour.   General Tsao's chicken and the Chef's special are both fantastic.  Cheap and a lot of quality food.

Awesome food, awesome prices, and great service.  If you're here on a Saturday afternoon to watch the games, or on a Friday night to rage and have a blast, this place does it all.

I literally can't even with this place.  There are no words to describe how incredible the food is here.  I won't recommend anything because it's not fair to even think about discrediting anything on the menu.  If you aren't religious and don't believe in a higher being, then come here and experience the closest place to heaven on earth you'll ever be.

Great sushi for the price!  Service was great, the fish was fresh.  All in all a very enjoyable experience.  No complaints and will come back again.
