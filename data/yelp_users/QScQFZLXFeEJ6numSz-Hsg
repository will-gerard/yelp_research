We had just purchased new front tires for our vehicle from Discount Tire in Anthem. Even though the location was a bit far, they recommended that we go to Network Alignment & Brakes as they are the best in the valley. Very glad we did. When they took a look at it they told me it didn't need an an alignment and I was good to go... no charge. Honest, personable, and great customer service. I will certainly be taking all my cars there from now on.

This place used to be really great. When the owners were working... The food was great and the Bloody Mary's were the best on the planet! ... But on Saturday... sadly sadly sadly disappointed in the service, food and drinks. Questioning on whether to ever come back.

Its hard to find a good Chiropractor in the valley. Dr. Dorchester and his staff at At My Best Health are absolutely the best in the business. I have both upper and lower back issues so seeing Dr. Dorchester on regular bases keeps me in tack and muscle tense free. Always there when you need an emergency quick fix... (which has happened a time or two) I would not hesitate in recommending Dr. Dorchester and his team at At My Best Health.   Thumbs Up! 100% -Michelle Conlon
