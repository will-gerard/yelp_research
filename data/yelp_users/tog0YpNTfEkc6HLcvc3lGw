Our family was in town and all staying nearby.  We wanted a place for 10 people to enjoy a Sunday brunch and gave this place a try.  What find:  We made reservations and were seated swiftly.  The service was quick and friendly.  It was as if we had our very own wait staff.  The brunch is the way to go as the choices will satisfy almost any group...surf or turf. The mimosas were a treat as well...nobody left hungry or disappointed.
