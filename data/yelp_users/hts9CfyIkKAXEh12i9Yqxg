This theatre is in a nice location so my husband and I enjoy coming here for a dine in movie experience. Things were very disappointing when we attended a movie last night. After finding our seats and looking at the menu we were saddened to find that it had completely been changed and all of our favorite items were basically gone. The menu had been reduced to basic "bar food" items. Then as the previews start we hear a "vacuum" sound in the theatre. We thought it was a temporary noise or maybe they were just cleaning the theatre next to us. Not the case, it was a sound we had to endure the WHOLE MOVIE!!!!! After several of us becoming disgruntled over the loud noise, my husband goes to complain and reports back that the movie attendant said it was the wind and there wasn't anything that could be done about it. Well, that's nice! Love paying to watch a movie that has a loud distracting  background noise! It would have been nice if a manager would have addressed the issue or at least given us a free voucher for the inconvenience when we exited the movie. It seemed that they didn't give a hoot about our experience and that was unsettling. None to say the least, not returning to this location any time soon.

I  recently had my fist time (very possibly the last ) with this location and I wanted to express how horrible my order was in hopes that this will contribute to helping this location be better. I ordered online and I was able to write how I wanted my sandwich which wasn't a super difficult way and when I received it I couldn't believe how bland it was and disappointing.  The delivery service was fast and convenient which I appreciated but it was my meal that was not as great. My sandwich was mostly lettuce which overpowered everything else in it, I had 1 little skinny piece of bacon, my meat was 2 very thin slices of each kind I ordered to where  I couldn't even taste it, and I had one little glop of avocado on the bottom portion of the sandwich. Moving on to the soup which was mostly cheese sauce because there was maybe 5 little itty bitty pieces of broccoli in there. I had to make more broccoli (fresh from my house) to add in there which made it amazing after the fact. We ordered around 8:15pm so we received our order right before 9pm so I am not sure if it was the night crew not wanting to make things satisfactory but at this point I would NOT recommend this to a friend to try and I myself would not want to return to eat there again.

I LOVE this place! We live right around the corner from one and I could go there everyday. I've had a lot of items on there menu and I have enjoyed each and every dish. The service is outstanding and I enjoy the selection they have for beverages. I'm a beer girl so I was pleased when I found out that they carry a nice variety on tap as well as seasonal shipments. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, whether you go with your family or you go to watch the game with friends because it is awesome. If you like peanuts, they are available at your table and you can just throw the shell on the ground.

I had my first visit today with my co-worker and friend who suggested it after coming a while back with her husband and I am HOOKED! The ladies working behind the counter were super nice, helpful, and very welcoming. We met the owner who was the sweetest lady and I even suggested an idea for a sandwich. The ambiance of the place is relaxing and open, not stuffy at all or has that heavy food smell. The meal deal is a great price because it includes a side that is a decent portion with the main dish you order. I had the popular #20 with the kale salad as my side and the pomegranate green tea.....YASSSSS AMAZING! The style of the sandwich is so unique and it's just enough to fill you up! The bread is similar to a sourdough in the way that it is soft in the middle but has a great crunch on the outside but it doesn't cut the roof of your mouth like some breads do when they are toasted. Everything was fresh that was in the sandwich and in the salad. I will definitely be back and this place is PHENOMENAL!
