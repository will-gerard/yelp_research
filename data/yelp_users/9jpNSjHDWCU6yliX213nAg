I used to go here and get a monthly massage with Dan. I like deep tissue and he does a fenominal job. I just couldn't afford the monthly membership anymore, as it gets pricy and forget about regular prices.

I get my hair cut here regularly by Lynette. The atmosphere is upbeat and prices are great. They even ask you if you'd like a water or soda upon arrival.

Used to go here quite often, but the food and atmosphere has changed dramatically. The portions are very small for the price. Had a small salad and a muffin and it was over $10! Will not be coming back.

This place is a hidden gem. Everything is baked from scratch and delicious. It's behind the Home Depot in an industrial complex, but don't let that deter you away. Excellent sandwiches and breakfast.

My dad had to be admitted for heart problems and was lucky enough to get a room on the 4th floor of the new tower. Wow! It's quite impressive and very roomie. Only concern is there are hardly any staff around and catching one is next to none unless you ring your call light.

Awesome place! Like the layout of the restaurant and all of the fresh and non-chain food combinations. Great place for a first date and is in down town Gilbert. They have an amazing iced coffee drink that's a must try!

If I'm off work or in the neighborhood at St. Joe's I always try and stop by. Fast service and great sandwiches. On point though: come on off lunch hours!

Fabulous beer battered fish and chips! Good beer and food. Very busy b/c of the ASU football game and the service is still good. Price is right and has a good vibe! Will be back for more pre-game tailgating!

Owners are always there and service is great. I love their Eggs Benedict and Strawberry pancakes! Fun, cosy little restaurant that has been there for years!

Love their breakfast burrito and chorizo burritos. Always go through the drive thru on my way to work. 2 meals easily as they are huge and the price is cheap!

Love, love, love this place! Healthy eating in a nice vibe place! I always get the Shwarma  and the hummus is so fresh. Like the rotating art that they have from various artists and the local feel it has to it.

Took my mom here last night for the first time. She loved it! I love the food here, but as for the service, its mediocre. Seating is kinda limited unless your at the bar or a smoker and are out on the patio. Love this place!

Went here for a first date with a guy. Sat at the bar and the bartender was flirting with me the the entire time! Was way awkward! Food and beer were great. Service was quick and friendly. Good upbeat and busy place. As for the date, was not my type.

Fun accessories and colors. Reasonably priced and a fun, upbeat atmosphere. Total girly, girl store.

Miss Lulu's just got taken over by BGSMC Food and Nutrition. Food is the same as the cafeteria on LL1. So sad, because this place used to be 5 stars! I feel it's doing a HUGE disservice to the employees and visitors. :( It's no where near as great as it used to be!
