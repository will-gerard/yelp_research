So good! Worth the wait for a table. Definitely recommend you arrive early before 7 p.m.

I decided to stop here because the Tempe location is great. Glendale...not so great! The soda was watered down and the wings were so basic. Something I could've heated up from a Tyson bag. Not only that but the 1/2lb  or 1lb deal is expensive for what they give. Kinda disappointed that this place sucked because Tempe is better.

Okay so I gave this place a second chance. How could I be so forgiving from my last experience? Once again, the food here is horrible. You're better off buying Tyson frozen wings and heating them up yourselves. Don't go here...ever.

I absolutely love this place! One of those places you can never say no too! I get the croissant delight, and it is so fresh and delicious. Very friendly staff and the wait for food is not long. A little more expensive than a Subway but it's worth it.
