Stopped by for a late lunch after catching a film during the Wisconsin Film Festival.  The film was rather dark and depressing.  The stomach was empty and growling.  My sister took me here and noted she takes everyone here.  The dal was ok, the samosa was great despite the sweet sauce it came floating on top of.  This is my opinion though. I'd rather coat my potato-y goodness in mint and cilantro.  My dosa was pretty good and the spice was just enough, not too much.  My sister's chicken korma was good.  I was digging the gigantic chunks of potato on her plate.  I stole them while she wasn't looking.  I want to bathe in the coconut chutney served on the side.  Pictures of dishes posted for your viewing pleasure.  :)

I would seriously make out with whomever buys merchandise for this store.  Free make out is not to be taken lightly!!  The Pantone Mugs, the Aviary Plates, The eco-messenger bags, the toys and cards and random assortment of goodness.  All of this, topped with the friendliest staff make this a destination place for my sister whenever she finds herself in Madison.  Why Pops holds a place in my heart though is this is where I discovered the Art-O-Mat machine.  Oh dear Art-O-Mat you are brilliant in so many ways.  For $5 you get a token at the register.  Bring it to the refurbished cigarette machine upstairs, pick a lever, insert token and pull.  Out will come a block o' art, roughly the size of a pack of cigarettes.  A portion of your well spent $5 goes to the artist who produced your block, a portion goes to the brilliant dude who maintains these machines and the store gets a portion to donate to a charity of their choosing.  And if that ain't special, I don't know what is.

Lunch here?  Very typical, spotty service (waiter seemed spacey), and my pasta was a bit too bland (orchette).  Dinner?  Completely different story.  I came here for a private dinner and the service, the wine and the tasting menu put together for us was absolutely divine.  I had couscous that made me want to cry, lobster canneloni that made me want to...cry,  chilean sea bass that made me want to...you get the picture.  If I hadn't been surrounded by collegues I would have been one gigantic mess, a puddle on the floor.  I love food and I love it when it is spot on and when it's interesting without being flat out weird.  I don't know why lunch was so off?  Edit:  I think I figured it out.  I had no idea there were 2 sections of the restaurant.  For lunch, we sat in the bar-like area where the service was "eh" and the food was "eh".  I imagine they have 2 seperate kitchens for the private dining and the bar area.

Get there early.  I mean, really early.  I mean, when they first open the doors kinda early. There aren't many tables and it's tiny inside.  The boards show what they have to offer everyday.  I hear it changes so they keep the menu fresh.    Be polite, the peeps here are good ones.  If they happen to have the Asparagus, Smoked Salmon, Cream Cheese, Dill Omelet.  Get it.   (pic posted)  If there are 2 people in your party, have your other party order the Cherry Crepes (if they're up on the menu). (pic posted)  Yes, get coffee.  Go halfsies on your breakfast.  Put your plates and cups away when you're done.  Get a cinnamon roll to go, for later, when you will definitely want more deliciousness in your stomach.  Lather, Rinse. Repeat.

Working in the hotel industry for five years, I have realized my tastes and standards are different from everybody.  Pars has a relatively small public space compared to the monstorous hotels on the strip.  This doesn't mean it's dinky, it's actually quite quaint.  Fake cobblestones that don't tend to agree with the stiletto heel'd clad ladies, patisseries and eateries and water fountains.  I was enamored more so with the outside.  The Eiffel Towe, the Arc, The fountain, at night it was beautiful.  The rooms.  This is where I disagree on some choices the hotel made.  I canna speak for any other rooms as I think the D/D and the Queen rooms are probably different, my single King was a good size, large and roomy.  The carpet, a garish houndstooth, was jarring to look at.  The red leather headboard was boardering bordello and the dinky loveseat was sad and small.  Ther service was great, if for some reason your compelled to order the Chicken Noodle Soup from Room Service, please don't.  The 24 hour eaterie in the casino is popular at 4:00 AM, so be prepared for a line no matter what time it is.

This was the highlight of my week long stay in Vegas.  I will agree with other yelpers, the restaurant is great because it's far enough away you forget you are in Vegas.  YAY! A+  My friend and I met for breakfast with no reservations.  It was relatively early for Vegas (9:00 AM).  We were told it would be a 25 minute wait.  As we were there for work and needed to get to a trade show, this was not good news for us.  Boo! C-  Ten minutes later we were fetched, a table had opened up earlier then anticipated.  YAY!!  A++  Coffee?  Not bad. Quiche?  Pretty good. French Toast with a side of sausage?  EXCELLENT.  I'm still dreaming about it.  I love the ambiance and the staff was so friendly.  I can't wait to go back.

A great reprise from the madness outside.  Something about the Wynn in general, gives me a sense of calm as opposed to the nervous titter of casino noise everywhere else.  Parasol Down became my favorite spot when friends and I stumbled upon it around midnight and had no trouble getting a table.  We sat and talked, drank and watched the little shows that would happen every hour.  It was so good I took a different set of friends there Friday night and while there was a wait for a table this time and our waitress was slow and horribly inattentive, I still loved siting outside, watching the waterfall and telling my friends:   "Wait for the frog.  No, dude,  we gotta see the giant frog.  It's almost 1:00AM.  It's gonna happen soon."  Sometimes, it's worth it buying the $7.50 bottle of water.

Had a late lunch here on a Saturday and you know what?  $10 for a decent grilled cheese and a tangy tomato soup?  EXCELLENT.  It was the highlight of an otherwise lackluster eating experience that day.

I would like a job choreographing the water.  How does one make that happen?  I'm a fan of the Sinatra and some of the opera routines, but the other ones have got to go. (Bleh.)  I've already choreogrpahed a number to 'Clark Gable' by The Postal Service.  And I seriously need a job.  This one would be perfect if it wasn't in Las Vegas.  (Bleh.)

negative stars abound.  I receive an ontrac delivery note on my mailbox.  1st attempt delivery.  I called them to change the address so my order ships to my office.  The woman took down the new address and told me i needed to call amazon and authorize the address change.  i get off the phone with her, i call amazon, i explain the need to change the address and they conference call in a representative from ontrac who confirmed that the new address and that they would deliver to my office and not my home.  I do not receive the package the next day.  I come home to find a second delivery attempt notice on my mailbox from ontrac.    After specifically asking and confirming the new address this second delivery attempt seems ridiculous. It also seems ridiculous that their pick up location is in SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO nowhere near public transportation.  I'm ready to have them return my order to Amazon so I can have it delivered via UPS.
