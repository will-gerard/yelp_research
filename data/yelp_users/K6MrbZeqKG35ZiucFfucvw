I hate to dis on a place that I stayed for free after being stranded in an airport after a cancelled flight....It wasn't great but it did the job.  The AC was loud and made it hard to sleep, the sheets were scratchy (cheap detergent), the continental breakfast was not so yummy, but the customer service was nice and it was 5 minutes from the airport.  If you are in a bind at Charlotte International Airport it is a convenient option.

My car battery died and I was a damsal in distress.  I called my dealership (Airpark Jeep) and they referred me to Valley TLC.  My tow truck arrived in 30minutes!  It was a nice tow truck with a flat bed in the back too so it would not ruin my vehicle.  Mathew was the driver and it turns out we are from the same area in the Northwest.  We chatted for a bit and then he hauled my car to North Scottsdale from Old Town Scottsdale.  The cost was about $108 which I found to be quite reasonable considering how fast they arrived and it was about a 15mile tow.  They also called to notify me when the vehicle was dropped off.  If you ever need a car towed call Valley TLC and hopefully Mathew is available.  I have no complaints!    From the card Mathew gave me it looks like they have many other transportation and vehicle services as well.

I love tarts and WOW, Coup Des Tartes has some amazing tarts! I felt like I took a 3 hour trip to one of my favorite restaurant/bakeries in Germany! This place is so quaint and adorable it is easy to pass it by because it looks like a little cottage off of 16th Street (well, because that is what it is).   We had the onion tart as an appetizer and it was quite tasty. The salad was just a salad. We ordered two entrees and shared because everything sounded really good on the menu. The Filet Mignon was perfectly cooked with mashed potatoes; it was nothing too exciting really as it was a typical filet. But, the halibut was amazing! It came with sea beans, which I had never had before! They are kind of like a cross between asparagus and green beans with a natural salty taste to them (they grow by the sea).  Atop all of that was a coconut oil sauce of some sort, which was VERY yummy!  The halibut was a delicious unique meal all around. We learned all about our food from our outstanding waitress, who did a superb job the whole evening. She also said their specialty is lamb, so I will be back to try that dish for sure.   My only complaint is the corking fee seems a bit steep, however all in all the meal is worth it! Also, if you forget your wine like I did (this place is BYOB), Total Wine is 2 blocks away :)   I had to save the best for last...dessert! Order any tart; I am sure it will make your taste buds happy!!

I love 'the Swiz'.  I ended up here on a Saturday night after a concert and we had a great time.  It is a rare feat to find a dive bar with generally pretty good looking people in it!  Also, I only verbally ordered a round of drinks once and the bartender remembered it for the rest of the night...just had to walk up to the the bar and presto, the drinks magically appeared on the counter!    I noticed the other reviews of old people frequenting the bar... Kind of strange because I don't think there was anyone over 40 at the bar when I was there.  This may also depend on the time of day, we did not show up until around midnight on a Saturday.

I'm glad we made a reservations!  On Wednesday at 8:30pm it was packed, which is a good sign!  We were greeted right away and were taken downstairs to their cozy basement (or cellar I should say).  It is very inviting with wooden ceilings and rafters with alluring stone fireplaces and leather lounge chairs.  I felt like I should be drinking scotch or bourbon down there!  We were seated by our waiter who was quite charming considering the full bar of people chattering away.  I should also note, we were placed in a great spot in the corner where you could observe the busy room or simply enjoy your company as if we were in a room to ourselves.    We ordered two glasses of wine, and the Mushroom Brie Toast to start.  The toast was pretty unique and tasty, with a variety of mushrooms piled on perfectly toasted French bread with the perfect amount of cheese laced atop. For an entree I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad with a soy vinaigrette.  It was good, with a healthy portion of perfectly cooked ahi, but the salad was kind of boring to me (mixed greens and tomatoes).  The vinaigrette was a bit on the soy-y side for me too...Yes I know that is what the dressing is called; I just expected something a bit more exciting and less salty.    My date had the NY strip.  It was prepared to temperature and covered in mushrooms, which we probably should have thought of pairing with and alternate appetizer...I think he had his fill of mushrooms for a month hahah!  But it was good nonetheless.  The asparagus was was gone first, so I am assuming it was delicious and the mashed potatoes (came in a little pot on the side) were just kind of boring.  Personally, I would have served the potatoes on the plate with the steak to soak up the wonderful au jus!    All in all we had a wonderful evening, in a great atmosphere, with great service and good food.  I would recommend it and I will be back!

I don't know what happened to this place!  They once had great bartenders that knew how to make some amazing cocktails, not to mention they could handle a full bar in stride....I went there last week and this place is just awful now in comparison.  I am sorry Merc, your service was poor and slow, with a kind of haughty, supercilious demeanor.  Not sure I will be back.

I went to Aunt Chilada's on a gorgeous 80 degree day in December, so we were able to sit outside. The patio is pleasant and plush with lots of plants, flowers, birds running around, and a fountain. As many of the other reviews said, the chips and salsa are great! Since my date and I ate so many chips, we decided to share a fajita, which was good but nothing special. The service was respectable and our water glasses were always filled. I did not drink, but I saw a few margaritas go by that looked quite tempting!! I also heard they have bands on the weekends, which I want to check out sometime. It was a great dining experience and the atmosphere on the patio was wonderful! I would definitely recommend going here on a nice day so you can sit outside.

This place is great! I have been here quite a few times and have never had any complaints. This last time I actually organized a party for 29 of my relatives with the catering manager and it went superbly! Everyone in the group (from more than 10 different states and Italy) thought the food, service and wine were outstanding. Many told me they planned on coming back when they come to Phoenix again. If you have a date, a business dinner, or a friend/relative you want to treat to a 5 star dinner you can't go wrong here! The food is very unique and delicious. This restaurant has one of the best wine cellars in town and the right people to lead you in the right direction for a good pairing. Oh and I can't forget to mention the ridiculously amazing view from the cliff top overlooking the Phoenix valley! This place is truly a Phoenix gem.

Divey dive for sure and I loved it!  I mozied in here on a random Tuesday with a buddy of mine, after leaving a lame dive bar... we thought it rocked!  My former local haunt of a dive bar has transformed into something I'm not really a fan of , so I am in need of a replacement (my buddy agreed).  This place has less than attractive people; they are friendly, kinda...if you can handle a few sarcastic jabs from the regulars :)  The bartender is wonderful, even though the top shelf here is probably the bottom shelf at most bars.  They apparently have music on the weekends and I can't wait to check it out...I will keep you updated; this may become my new favorite five star dive bar!

I feel I must tell you now, I am a regular here.  Afterall I only live a block away.  When I initially moved into the neighborhood, I thought Brigett's looked quite scary...I was very wrong, and it is a great dive bar!  This place has great food and all the bartenders are quite nice, the owner is usually around talking to customers, and the patrons are very friendly.  If you are a loner, there are plenty of dark corners for you, but I almost guarantee you will have met someone before you leave or have at least been entertained by the people there.   I can't ever decide what I want to eat here because there are so many great choices.  My top three are:  the tacos YUUUUUMMMMMM, the California Chicken Club AMMMMazing, and the sliders (any of them).  The drink prices are great, particularly for draft beer (not a great selection though for beer connoisseurs).   I don't know if I would describe the ambiance as pleasant... this place has karaoke EVERY night, so if you are a karaoke fan you must check it out.  I myself can only stand it once in a while.   I usually leave before 9p when it starts.  But I must say, Terry, the MC/DJ for karaoke has a way of keeping the crowd going and has a massive following of karaoke regulars at this joint.  Brigett's always has people whether 10am or 10pm and the alcohol is always flowing.  If you like random crowds and people watching with great bar food, this place is for you. I forgot to mention: the bathrooms are AWFUL!

This is almost embarrassing!! I never thought I would review a fast food joint on Yelp! Where to begin...my first time at this Jack in the Box was a 'walk-through' where I tried to persuade the nice lady at the window to let us buy food, as we were in no condition to be driving. She said it was against the rules and she could get in trouble, but we could probably easily persuade someone in a vehicle...which we did, The food was of course awesome, but I believe anything is probably amazing considering the state we were in that night.   The second time I was actually driving through after being DD for a birthday bash late in the evening. Ironically, I was asked to help some 'walkers' get their food. I also learned from these late night patrons that the sweet lady at the late-night window was Tess and that they always call in great reviews for her, which I found quite hilarious coming from two drunk burly men! Hahah, makes me laugh just remembering the image. I came to realize after living in this neighborhood for a while that this place has quite a few late-night regulars!   In addition another afternoon, after leaving the pool, my friend and I were starving and I volunteered to pick-up some food at good old Jack in the Box. My friend had recently become vegan, which I had forgotten up until my arrival at the menu.....hmmmmm, what on earth will I get her besides fries?! So I consulted another friendly Jack in the Box employee at the window and asked her if it was possible to take all the meat and cheese off the chicken fajita pita and add as many vegetables as they had. She also put every sauce in the bag because I was clueless in the vegan department. This along with some churros and my friend was quite impressed and she said it was quite tasty!!!   This place looks like any other Jack in the Box, and really probably tastes like most (it is always quite fresh though). But the service here is above and beyond! If you are ever near Cave Creek and Bell Road and have the urge for food on the fly, this is by far the place to go!  I gave it five stars in comparison to other fast food restaurants; obviously this is not exactly 5 star dining!  :)

Aside from the fact that the signage driving around this airport is abrupt and for the most part directionally sucky, this airport has grown on me.  There are lots of places to eat, with a good variety.  You can make it from one side to the next pretty swiftly.  There are some cute touristy Arizona stores, places to buy decent books, some interesting apparel stores and to top it off the customer services is very pleasant as well as efficient.   Did I mention TSA actually runs a pretty good ship here at least in my experiences?  They do the best they can to do their job well, while keeping in mind the concerns of travelers, and they are not complete overweening A-holes!

If you are looking for a good Western 'City Slicker' experience this is the place to go!  I have been taking friends visiting from out of town to Ponderosa Stables for over 4 years now.  By far their best ride is the T-bone steak evening ride.  You ride off into the sunset into the South Mountains and enjoy the beautiful desert scenery as the sun paints a glorious colorful sky over the mountains.  At one point there is a beautiful lookout view of the Valley of the Sun, which is a great for pictures.  About an hour and a half later as the sun drops below the crest of the hill and your butt starts to ache from straddling a saddle, you arrive at the T-Bone Steak House, where you tie up your horse and go in for a drink and good food.  I have met the owner and he is a genuinely nice fellow and is proud of his restaurant. The steaks are perfectly cooked with a basic salt and pepper seasoning.  Their grilled corn on the cob is my favorite side and every meal comes with an open salad bar, nothing fancy but it hits the spot after a long ride.  After you drain the drop of your last drink and the moon is rising, you saddle back up and ride back home at night.  It is amazing to see the city scape at night from the mountainside, hear the sounds of desert life in the distance, and experience watching the horses expertly traverse the terrain in the dark!  The ride back seems to go faster, but I think that is because the horses are excited they are going home for the evening.    I think the age limit for this ride is 6 and the weight limit is around 250lbs.  The cost is about $45.  It is well worth it and will keep coming back; I have never had a disappointing experience at Ponderosa Stables!  Yeeehaaaw! :)

I drive by this place everyday and have never been inside, so yesterday I was feeling the urge for something new and stopped in.  Many items on the menu looked delicious and the pizza smelled awesome, but that sounded like too much food...I ended up ordering the Italian Sub and the Cheesy French Bread with marinara to-go.  I did not realize the sub came with a side of fresh cut fries, so it ended up being a ton of food, but I was not disappointed!    The French bread is made in-house and tastes good.  It came with Italian spices sprinkled over the top and the perfect amount of cheese, not to mention perfectly cooked (little crispy along the edge).  The only negative, it was a bit skimpy on the yummy marinara sauce.    The Italian sub was also tasty, no special meat or anything but delicious nonetheless.  The fresh cut fries were a pleasant surprise considering I didn't realize they came with my order :)   The service was great and the gentleman at the counter was very helpful and informative.  Chizona's has been around 11 years and has a Midwestern vibe inside.  Lots of Chicago sports memorabilia on the walls and the smell of pizza, hot-dogs, and pizza puffs...yum!  I should note for all the Chicagoans that it is NOT deep-dish Chicago style pizza, but it looked good (have not tried it yet).  If you want to deliver, he informed me there is a $10 minimum. Also, they have walk-in specials (i.e.  Vienna beef hot-dog, fries and a drink for $4.99).  I have no doubt, I will be back for more!

The food was just okay, I have had much better from many taco joints.  I am rather bummed because this place is not far from where I live.    My sister and I ordered chicken, carnitas, and carne asada tacos to share.  The carne asada was the best of the 3, but nothing to write home to mom about.  The carnitas was overcooked and crispy/burnt/dry.  The chicken taco was pretty good, but again nothing exciting.  The sauces (green and red salsa) were not very spicy and rather blah.  I can say the service was very fast and the prices were cheap.  Most of the tables were not cleaned off in the restaurant.  Also, we ordered everything without guacamole and that seems to be their claim to fame, so maybe we are a bit biased and missing out on the key ingredient.    I will be back if I am in desperate need of a taco nearby, but I will hopefully find a better place before that desperate moment occurs.

I am not a green thumb but, Jeremy made me feel like I could be!  I was on a mission to buy a cactus for my deck because I figured that would be the hardest thing to kill, since I do not have the greatest track record with the viability of vegetation.  I am not sure why other reviews are complaining about selection because this place is HUGE!  I felt like I was in a plush tropical forest :)     Jeremy ended up steering me in another direction and asked me a smart question, "Why don't you buy something useful?  That can be your incentive to keep it alive."  EUREKA!  So, we (more he than I) ended up making a 'mohito bowl', which is a pot with a lime tree surrounded by various kinds of mint, perfect for making all kinds of wonderful fresh beverages!  I did not even know there were so many kinds of mint (I ended up with orange mint, pineapple mint, spearmint, chocolate mint, lime mint and lemon balm)!  He also noted it would make my balcony smell wonderful and if I opened the sliding glass door, my house would fill with the clean aromas of fresh lime and mint.  I am forever SOLD on Moon Valley Nursery.  Not only is the selection great, the prices fair, but the help is helpful and most importantly CREATIVE!  I posted a picture of my 'Mohito Bowl' put together...I managed to get it together myself.  My one complaint: I had to get a little dirty Haha!   Bottom-line if you are looking for some vegetation, whether a pro or a novice, this is a great place to start!  Also I should mention, there are lots of VERY cool cacti here too!

Houston's always has consistently very good food.  The service is pretty decent, though I have had a few incidences of a snotty bartender.  I have eaten everything from the smoked salmon appetizer, to the tuna salad, to a steak dinner and it was always well presented and delicious.  The drinks are a bit on the pricey side, but I guess that is to be expected at a nice restaurant in Scottsdale.    The atmosphere is great if you want an intimate setting.  The booths are cozy and arranged so you don't hear 3 other tables' conversations.  Last time I went they had a very pleasant Jazz band playing in the background.  Also, the bar is a great place to sit if you are alone and just want a good meal and a drink.    I should also note this is a very busy restaurant and the wait times can be long.  If you have a big party or want dinner on the weekends, I recommend booking a reservation.

Oh the TallyHo!  This place is nondescript from the outside with no windows and once inside it is like a time-warp to the 70's.  The crowd is varied: I mean everything from lawyers, to college kids, Vietnam vets, to neighborhood regulars, neighborhood locals who NEED a drink, strippers, cougar clubs, retirees,  crack and meth heads...really nothing would surprise me here.  I have definitely met some interesting people here and that is part of the allure of the TallyHo.   I am familiar with 2 of the bartenders and they are nice ladies...maybe a bit rough around the edges, but I think you have to be at a place like this.  I was impressed they always seem to remember me though, as I have only been in a few times.  Their drink pours are no joke and they are very good at remembering your drink of choice.  Also I should note this is a cash bar so come prepared.  As Michael C. said the entertainment consists of a pool table and a jukebox.  There are also 2 smallish TVs and I myself just enjoy the 'atmosphere'.  If you have a friend in need of a drink ,or you need one yourself, or you just want to make yourself aware of the fact that your day wasn't that bad, well then come join the folks at the TallyHo Cocktail Lounge.

Yes I am reviewing a Safeway.  I swear I have my reasons: THE Safeway Café.  I told my boyfriend that we should pick up Subway on the way home and once he realized the Subway by my house was next to Safeway, he said, " We should go to the sub bar in Safeway!"  I retorted, "Whhhhhhhattttt???!!"  Needless to say he proved me wrong.    You can get any kind of sub with 6 different kinds of  bread.  They put lots of meat on the sub so you won't feel jipped. The meat is of very high quality compared to most sub joints (my Italian sub had prosciutto on it).  Also, your chicken breast is actually recognizable as a chicken breast and not some weird chicken breast composite.  The customer service is always great and friendly.  They didn't even mind my indecisiveness...I hate it when I am like that.  Also, after you buy 7 subs, you get the 8th one free!  The subs only cost $4.99-5.49 and you can add on a drink and a pretty large bag of chips (the 2.5servings- size) for only a $1!!   This of course doesn't compare to DeFalco's, but if I am in a hurry and just picking up something quick at the store this is a great option...and much better than Subway, Jimmy John's, Quizno's, Blimpie's etc.

They have a great Sunday Buffet!  $17 dollars gets you all you can eat plus bottomless mimosas!  Our server was outstanding!  Plates were cleared right away so we could make room for more, and the second our glasses neared the bottom...wah-la a new sparkling mimosa landed on the table!  My only complaint was there were no donuts, and the keylime pie tasted quite artificially flavored.  Generally speaking though this is a great Sunday brunch for the price!

I have walked in here quite a few times after work for a last minute mani or pedi or both and they always get to me right away, even if they are busy.  This last time I had Amy, she is new to this salon but she was a doll and very good pedicurist.  She even painted an adorable snowflake on my big toe for the holidays!  Clean salon, great service, reasonable prices and massaging chairs...that's all I need :)

I was in line forever (was there for 70min total).  The cleaning job was rather lackadaisical.  The customer service on the front end was rather banal, and all my questions were answered as minimally as possible.  The guy who handed off my car to me at the end was quite nice, but they usually are because they want a tip.  Anyway, I will not be back.

My brother ordered me a Cannondale bike for Christmas and had it sent to the Bicycle Ranch to be put together, because they didn't have it in any stores down in AZ yet.  I called them the day it was delivered because I was so excited, and they put me on the list to have my bike done first :)  4 hours later I walked in and saw my stellar looking new bike ready to go in the back of the room.  They saw my gawking and the guy at the front says, you must be Lisa...He walked me over and showed me the ropes on my SWEET new ride!  The mechanic also said hi and told me about my cool bike!  They equiped me with some new equipment I needed and away I went.  I will be back at the Bicycle Ranch for my 90 day check-up/tune-up.    I went back once more for a new lock (since my last one was broken when my old bike was stolen :(  Again, the service was quick and to the point.  They also have 'meet-up' rides that leave from the shop; you can find the schedule on their website.  I have never gone, but I thought that was pretty cool.    If you are looking for a new bike, they can definitely help steer you in the right direction, and the service was great for my pre-ordered bike :)

So, it reminds me of being pelted by my older brother's gatling rubber-band gun.   And I think to myself, 'Hair free, no hair, die hair!' and then ZAP, and I quiver again...but as they say 'no pain, no gain!'  What you gain: No more ingrown hairs, razor rash, stubble, nicks, pesky stray long hairs...and oh yeah it is soooo silky smooth afterward.  And lets just say, my Ex didn't complain... Yes, there is maybe the one day of skin sensitivity, but it is worth it for dead hair follicles in return!    I have been a swimmer for years and love to hang out at the pool.  I have tried every hair removal option on the planet and this is by far the best.  It really isn't all that expensive either when you compare it to how much you spend on disposable razors over time.  And waxing sucks because you have to allow it to regrow, it is not permanent, it is painful and practically the same price as lasering.    I should also mention this technology is still not perfect.  I have black hair which is the best kind for laser hair removal.  It still takes me about 6-8 visits for ideal hair reduction.  If you have very fine or light colored hair it will not work.  It also does not work on grey hairs :( If you have darker pigmentation in your skin it can be challenging to laser the hair too.    I should also give a shout-out to Yancy (Hope I spelled that right), she is my favorite Laser Expert at this location; I made up that job title myself but that is what it should be!  I have been going here for over a year and they are the best!  I tried one other place and it did not compare to the service level or value at Laser for Less.

My friend and I tag team car washes here frequently. It is self-service and only a dollar for 3 minutes. You can do a whole car in 6 minutes...sparkling in 9 minutes. We always work it with one person washing while the other one wipes things down with a rag/towel. They actually have different fluids for the settings (I think there is about 8 different settings).  Wash Around the Clock also has vacuums that do shampooing as well, although some are better than others. There is a drive through car wash, but I have never used it.  If you don't mind getting a little dirty and putting some elbow grease into washing your own car, for only a few bucks this place is great!!  Not to mention a good half hour work out, depending on how much work you put into it ;)

This is my go-to place in my new neighborhood!  I think I ate here 3 times in one week, during my move and lack of kitchen.  I love their chili rubbed salmon!  I am not sure what they do to the potatoes that come on the side, but they are amazing!  I recommend eating the chili, the potatoes are served in, along with them; it really adds to the flavors!  The servers and bartenders are very friendly, insightful about the menu, and accommodating.  The chips and fresh salsa served with any entree are so delicious, I ended up buying a jar to take home (comes in a cute jar too).  You do not need a reservation here, but it always seems to be quite busy.   Blue Adobe also has live music Thursday through Saturday, but it is not open that late (maybe 11 or so).  I saw Ivan on Thursday and he played an acoustic guitar and sang with a unique, sexy voice ;)  He also did some great renditions of a few classic Christmas Carols for the holidays.

I picked up a jar of fresh-made salsa and chips for the Superbowl party I was attending last Sunday because they are that outstanding!  They were a big hit!    If you are dining at the Blue Adobe, definitely try the chips and salsa.  I am not a big fan of chipotle seasoning... it is definitely one of the key ingredients, but regardless I think it tastes great.  If you like it, you can buy a jar of the fresh salsa and take it home with you for about $9 (it is a good sized jar).

I am not a breakfast nut like my gal Nydi, but when I am feeling HUNGRY after a long night out there is nothing like some greasy wholesome breakfast food!    What sets Breakfast Club (BC) apart is the younger crowd and the lively vibe, and quite frankly just about everyone in the room seems to be in the same state I am when I stroll in here on the weekends...except the few random tourists.  The two servers I recently had here were fabulous and quite funny as well.  Sometimes I feel like they need background music in here though, I felt like I was very aware of everybody's conversation around me.  And heaven forbid anybody have to listen to me and my friends' ridiculous conversations...Although on the flip side I have met some cool neighborly people in the BC due to this feature.    My other complaint is there will most certainly be a wait.  However I guess that is to be expected in this busy part of town and a testament to their sound and hearty breakfast grub!  I usually just have crispy bacon and hash browns at the BC, but I can say all my friends have had some impressive and yummy breakfast dishes for a reasonable price!  I also highly recommend their hazelnut iced coffee; my server recommended it to me last time and it is now a staple when I come the the BC!

Warning, there are usually drunk people here...and 30 minutes after I get here, I am usually one of them.  I love Sunday Fun-day on the patio at Dos; always a great friendly vibe from the patrons and staff.  DO drink the FROZEN margarita.  I am normally not a fan of frozen margaritas, but they are very good here!  Also, I always eat their tater tots, but that probably has something to do with the drunk factor not culinary expertise.  There is this bartender, who is outstanding, but of course I don't know his name.  So that was basically a rather useless tidbit of information.  All I know is when I go to Dos he seems to be in tune with my salivary glands, because right when my drink is empty he gives me the nod to signal the next one is on the way.

If you are looking for any kind of obscure hat this is your place!  They have all kinds of hats here!  They even have stuff in storage that they can get if you need something that is 'out of season'.    I happened to walk in a few days after the Kentucky Derby and what a treat, so many amazing, beautiful, well-made hats!! I was there for another need, but wow, I almost wanted to buy a crazy derby hat...such COOL stuff!    The sales associate was extremely helpful; you can tell they know their hats (any genre).  They are a bit on the expensive side, but nice well-made hats are pricey.

If you don't find this bar entertaining on some level, then you should probably go to The Mint. This is like the wet dream of a college boy's favorite dive bar...strong drinks, 40oz beer bottles, beer pong, booze wheel, jello shots, swinging seats, hot-mess stripper pole, and oh yeah a midget bar.  If you have friends in town that enjoy ridiculousness, this is probably a landmark they must witness.  Enough said, I think that sums it up!

No AC! Hot and humid up in here in August!  There was no attendant at Ginny's on a Sunday while it was pretty busy.  The change machine was out of quarters.  The commercial size drier I needed kept showing an error while not working and still counting down my time...Apparently "DOOR" error means: lint catcher not closed tightly, not the door to the drier isn't closed...stupid.  I won't ever be back, but I managed to freshen up my comforter with a dry-cleaning kit, which was my goal so it was not a total loss.

In the best interest of everyone, due to my minor lactose intolerance, I don't do ice cream often.  But, Sugar Bowl is worth it!!  No, it is not the fancy shmancy ice cream infused with liqueur, or homemade, hand-churned with all natural ingredients from the desert...It is just good, old, run-of-the-mill, GOOD ice-cream.  Ice-cream is kind of like pizza, the bad stuff is still pretty good, and this is definitely better than most.  What sets Sugar Bowl apart is the old fashion style sundaes with whip cream and cherries (the philosophy of if it isn't broken why fix it definitely applies here), along with the traditional, charming, atmosphere of an old-school ice-cream parlor.    I would tell you my favorite desserts, but you might as well look at the menu because I would have typed the majority of it.  I have only had dessert here and not tried the food, but I don't really think the 'food' is what you come here for.    Sugar Bowl takes me  back to being a kid and making my own sundaes at home...it HAD to be in the 'fancy' ice-cream dish, with a cute spoon to eat it with, and LOTS of chocolate!  And that is what makes it worth the hour long belly ache afterward ;)

Good times!  Went shopping today then met up with a gal pal at the Coach House because I had never been here, but I had heard about it many times!  The Christmas lights are quite impressive this time of year and the service was good.  They have glasses you can look through that make all the lights look wacky, so make sure to have a peek.  The bar didn't look too divey with heat lamps and all the lights up, but I'm sure when the decorations are down the place looks much different!  The crowd is a good mix too.

So it is that time of year again where people are going to take their children to sit on Santa's lap, and others go to see the Nutcracker...well, I prefer swinging by the Coach House to check out their festive Christmas decor and drink a Guinness.  This bar is really more of a shack, and one of a few claiming to be the oldest bar in Old Town.  I only really come here during the holidays when the shack transforms into more of a gingerbread house full of random people, or if I am giving a tour of the 'oldest bars in Old Town'.  The service is always decent and quick, drinks are well poured and cheap, the crowd is always entertaining and interactive, and if you aren't into people-watching you can stare at the crazy lights and garlands.  I think this bar is open all hours you can legally drink!  Make sure to check out the pictures posted; the Christmas decorations are no joke!

This gym is no joke.  At the end of my boxing workouts, dripping in sweat, I just want to yell, "Yo Adrian, we did it...WE did it!"  I am not really a weight room kind of gal, but I do know buff studly males when I see them and maximum fitness is full of them....but girls don't go here to pick up the men because you can tell this is some serious gym time and not social hour.  If you just want to bounce on an elliptical and 'workout' this is probably not the place for you.  On the other hand if you are looking for a serious workout, I HIGHLY recommend Maximum fitness!

It was around 1am, after exploring the dives along the South side of Old Town and many cervesas later, we were strolling along and the smell of food came to my senses and low and behold to my left was the Super Burrito!  I had flashbacks from college to a joint called Burritos As Big As Your Head and I had to give it a try!  We walked in the door and, how appropriate, there was a guy stoned out of his brains waiting to dive into some late-night Mexican grub Hahah!    It also was very apparent to me because I am a bit of 'clean freak', that the place was very sterile...stainless steel counter tops, open view to the kitchen, clean tile floors...few 24hour places ever look that clean (I have only been here once but I hope it is always like that-extra kudos).  So I walk to the counter and the friendly gentleman asked me what I was hungry for and I had no idea!  So he gave me a brief tour of the menu and I opted for the Super Nachos to share with mi Amigo!  It came covered in lots of yummy carne asada and they added lots of pico de gallo for me, and then we topped it with various fresh salsa from the salsa bar.  And because the street tacos, our stoner neighbor was chowing down on, looked sssooooooo good I had to try two of them too!  FYI the carne asada is better than the carnitas.  We did not go home hungry that early Saturday 'morning'!    As you would expect at such a place, the prices are very reasonable, but what sets this place apart for me was the cleanliness and great service...oh yeah and the food is good, but what isn't at the wee hours of the morning  :)

My dirty Jeep now looks brand new!  My vehicle was in desperate need of some TLC.  I have always come here for basic car washes; the customer service is top notch...so when I need a good detail done on my Jeep (company coming into town), I figured Francis & Sons was right for the job.  They did not disappoint and exceeded my expectations!

This is my first 1 star rating!  :(   I figured I would give this DQ/Orange Julius (both inside this location) near my work a shot. DQ in general must be the most overpriced place to go for fast-food considering the quality and quantity you receive (aside from the blizzards).  Jennifer T. is right about the fact that this specific location has a limited meal selection...I was hoping for a burger and ended up with a sandwich the size of the palm of my hand. To top it off I was charged for a large Orange Julius fruit Smoothy instead of a medium, and there was hardly any fruit in it, so it tasted like the syrupy orange sorbet base and not berries.  Although, I should note the server was friendly and the place was very clean. Unfortunately, I came for food and not the ambiance.  The highlight was the piece of bacon on my meager club sandwich.  I got a crappy smoothy and a tiny sandwich for ten dollars; I will not be back here ever.

Apparently this is the spot to get comforters cleaned!  I just read WW.'s review before writing mine and my story is pretty much the same!  Delia's is speedy, affordable and my comforter looks GREAT!  What else could you want from a dry cleaning business?

I took 27 of my relatives here on a cold gloomy day and it was still amazing! Even though I have been here quite a few times before, I still learned things from our tour guide that I did not know about this amazing place. If you are visiting or have a guest visiting Phoenix this place is a must! Some tour guides are better than others, but the gentleman we ended up with this last time around was phenomenal!  Also, I would actually recommend going about two/three days after a big rain storm because all of the desert flowers will bloom and it looks absolutely beautiful.

This is the worst concert venue I have ever encountered and I have been to LOTS of concerts! If you are from out-of-town and pondering seeing a show here...steer clear!  First of all security getting into the place was ridiculous and borderline violating.  My breasts have not been felt up like that ever in public, not to mention behind my belt buckle!  I mean way worse than TSA!!! Not to mention they make you take your shoes off and pull EVERYthing out of your pockets, taking for freaking ever!  I think they frisked me more because i had eye drops on me.  Oh yeah, it is the dessert and it is dry and therefor i need eye drops to keep my eyes wet! They analyzed my lip balm, I  forgot to remove from my pocket, like it was a bomb Lol! You would have thought we were in a police state with all the cop cars out front and minors/stoners getting busted.  Usually police are at concert halls to keep people safe and deal with emergencies, not to interrogate all the patrons based on what the security goons have to say.   Once inside the place is a dump, not that it is a big deal being a concert hall and all, but it is, and there are few places to get beverages for such a big hall.  In the bathroom there were ladies doing lines off the paper towel dispensers so apparently the Gestapo outside didn't help. While watching  the show many people were getting yanked out of the concert for behavior/drugs/nothing at all etc.  The crazy security and the police force outside definitely ruin the fun of going to concerts at this place.  But I did get a free CD tossed to me by the band on stage, so that was a perk.  We also have a pretty good story I guess, now that we can laugh about it.   THIS PLACE SUCKS HARD!

So, I had free tickets to a show last night again at the Marquee...apparently the level of security and 'strictness' depends on the band that is playing.  It wasn't anywhere near as horrible as my first experience at this venue, but I've experienced much better.  I still only give it two stars because they need more places to serve beverages, or have another place to get non-alcoholic beverages.  Also the security to get inside is ridiculous.  If in Phoenix, the open-air concerts at Tempe town Lake or in Glendale by the arenas are much better.  For indoor venues I like the Rhythm Room or for hard rock/metal the Clubhouse is good.

First of all this ranch is off the beaten path near Cave Creek and Carefree, and when I say off the path I mean dirt/rocky road, so be careful if you are driving a smaller vehicle.  We were there on a morning after a monsoon and I was glad I drove a Jeep; there were quite a few washes flooding the rocky road.  It is a little difficult to figure out where you need to be going, but just drive to the end of the road and look for the ranch that looks more like a ghost town (see pictures).  We ended up not being able to go horseback riding due to flooded trails but the terrain looked beautiful and he offered to let us go on the longer ride for the same price a few hours later to make up for the cancellation.    While you are at the 'homestead' be sure to look for the BIG pig named Gilbert.  He was under the porch while were standing on it and I thought I was hearing a javelina snorting, but the gentleman let me know it was just Gilbert HAhaha!    Everyone here seems very excited about what they do and it is quite beautiful up there.  If you want to introduce somebody to the Sonoran desert with saguaros and sunshine, this is a great way to do it.

The Westin Casuarina and I started off on the wrong foot. Nobody was checked-in on time (4pm), yet we checked in at 11am and there was still no room available at the official check-in time at 4pm...many other people were waiting in the lobby as well. Yes, they were very busy; in my opinion that is just bad business for a hotel. The service was however outstanding and they were very apologetic and gave us a $25 dining comp...whoopy. I do not recommend the hotel restaurant. The rooms were very unmemorable, but we are in Vegas and never really in the room anyway. As many other Yelpers said, the bed was very comfortable. The plus about this place is that it is a very small hotel, so you don't have to walk a mile to find the exit like in many of the large Las Vegas hotels.   If you are looking for glamorous lights flashing, music pumping, casino bells ringing, Las Vegas stereotypical kind of hotel, this is not it. This is not a bad choice however if you want something more low key, relaxing and easy access to get to the strip, meetings etc.   I ended up at the Westin Casuarina due to Priceline (and this is not a 4 star hotel at all)...I probably would not stay here again because I go to Vegas for the glitz, but if you want something more low-key this place may be for you.

My Dearest Durant's, I have long neglected a review of you because I would hate to do you any injustice.  We have wined and dined, drank and desserted, celebrated, and commiserated.  I have slurped your oysters, sopped up your white wine mussels with your delicious bread, navigated my way through an entire Del Monaco many a time, and indulged in all of your decadent desserts.  I know you roll out the red carpet for everyone and allow them to walk through your glorious kitchen with the charming hellos, but I like to pretend it is all for me just as when it was a hush speak-easy!!  I am a member of the Porterhouse Club, yes I ate the whole thing with plenty of witnesses.  Based on this I can proudly say Durant's steak is delicious, otherwise I never would have made it into the infamous club.  My favorite is the Durant's Del Monaco, a lovely bone-in NY strip cooked perfectly to your desires.    All dishes come accompanied with fresh bread drenched in olive oil and leeks, as well as a dish of fresh 'iced' veggies (old-school style).  Their Cesar Salad has a delicious  anchovy dressing.  The asparagus comes out nicely cooked with a little bit of crunch.  Sometimes, if inspired, I get the mushrooms along with my steak and I have never been disappointed.   I have brought friends here for happy hour, partied for special occasions, caught up with relatives, been on romantic dates, and simply just showed up to indulge on steak.  Durant's never disappoints.    The dessert menu is impressive all alone...if you want a treat get the strawberry shortcake for two with extra chocolate curls.  Honestly it serves 4; I am not exaggerating,  just look at my photos!    And let us not forget the cocktails.  Some of these bartenders have been here for decades and they have been for a reason.  Durant's was once a speakeasy and the cocktails have not lost their stiffness.  I recommend a dry gin martini with a twist or a manhattan, but if I am feeling fancy a clover club does the trick.     And then there is happy hour... honestly it is amazing this fancy restaurant has happy hour.  It is only served at the bar and they have a limited menu that is reasonably priced.  The sliders are decent, but my go-to is the mussels in white wine garlic sauce.  They same dish on the regular menu is over $20, and it is around $8 during HH, and it is HUGE.    The interior is red, like royal red everything, soft velvety wallpaper with private booths.  It feels, looks and smells like a steakhouse should. And folks don't think you will be talking on your cellphone here, that is what the phone booth is for!  Just one more reason Durant's is fabulous.

Surprisingly I had a blast at this place last night! For a club it is a bit on the small side, but other than that it is pretty nice. It was a Monday night(watching a DJ spin) so it was not jam packed; i am sure the weekends can be a bit ridiculous in here. I am not sure what I think about the voyeuristic bedroom that overlooks the dancefloor...meaning from the dancefloor you can look up at a staged bedroom (looks like a VS fitting room), where a chic pretends to put on make-up, write in her diary, lay around in bed, etc. while wearing lingerie. It is definitely entertaining for sure! I wonder how much those ladies get paid to 'do what they do' up there!!??  Anyway, they also have body painted 'topless' cocktail waitresses, which I'm sure the men love. If you are a bit of a prude this is probably not the joint for you. I am sure this place pulls in lots of Scottsdale's finest douchebagery and fembots, but I cannot deny I had a pretty rad time there on an 'off' night! I danced till the lights came on (along with many others) and I haven't done that in a while! The service was great and the drinks were well poured...did I mention the bartender wasn't too shabby to look at either ;) Whether male or female, it is not too hard to find something tantalizing at the PCL!

I might be in love.  This place may have just blown my last crush away!  I had driven by this rather nondescript place a million times thinking, "I really need to stop in there and check it out".  I also had a fellow, respected cocktail-connoisseur tell me I had to go here for the amazing cocktails and ambiance...that was over a year ago.  So I finally mosied in on a Thursday night and was IMPRESSED.  Shady's has great tunes coming out of the jukebox, great bartenders that made fantastic beverages, and quite a friendly cool crowd.  For all the beer people they also have a good variety of beers.  Oh and did I mention it is INEXPENSIVE!  I thought they screwed something up when the bill arrived because it was so FREAKING cheap.  I went back Friday and Saturday just to confirm:  Shady's is indeed AWESOME.

If this place wasn't 10miles from my house I would frequent it all the time!! I went on the road trip here seeking Pomegranate Molasses...yes it is a thing.  They had 4 kinds to choose from!  Mind you I had been to Fry's Marketplace, Whole Foods and Trader Joes trying to find the stuff!  As a side note the Trader Joes 'guy' told me to come here after doing a bit of googling!  FYI Pomegranate Molasses is $27 on Walmart's website!!! At Baiz they have four kinds ranging from $2.49-3.99!  So they are extremely reasonable.  The vegetables section is very fresh with a great variety of vegetation.  If you are making anything from scratch Baiz has amazing ingredients and obscure items to make exotic dishes!  The customer service was very friendly; there were only two cashiers open and decent lines.  But really no big deal, I was tantalized by the yummy looking foreign chocolate bars surrounding the register, but somehow managed to resist!    Just being in Baiz Market inspires me to want to cook more!!  I will be back.

The Vig has a GREAT patio with outdoor lounge furniture, fireplaces and heat-lamps creating a great ambiance whether for a romantic evening or a chance to chill with some friends.  The inside is small, with little seating, so I don't really recommend it.  The service is impeccable, walking the fine-line of attentiveness without being overly attentive.   The live music at the Vig is very enjoyable and not played too loud, so you can still carry on a decent conversation while enjoying the backdrop of some IMPRESSIVE musicians...Last night I was there, the lead guitarist and singer from the Gin Blossoms were playing :)

Not sure how they do it, but somehow I always get swept into drinking margaritas at their happy hour here.  I should add, this place has an awesome happy hour!  Don't make the mistake of ordering a bunch of appetizers thinking they will be small because they are so cheap during happy hour, as all of the appetizers are huge!  I went here with a gal pal of mine for the first time during happy hour and we ended up with a whole table of food because we ordered 3 appetizers...We were eating Mexican for the next 3 days!   I have never been on the restaurant side, but the bar is great and the service is generally outstanding (had bad service only once).  There are a lot of regulars that go to this place making it always fairly packed.  If you want a quiet Mexican restaurant this is not it.  Parking can be a pain in the booty because the lot is generally full.  There are some lots near it and to my knowledge I have not seen anyone towed.

This may be my new favorite spot in Phoenix! I have been here about three times over the last two weeks and every time was all around peeerfect! I had heard of this place a million times and had never made it in, so finally my sister was in town to visit from San Fran (total foody might I add) and I paid Fuego Bistro a visit! We were impressed! First of all their specialty-the empanade, was excellent, which you would expect considering it is the specialty...but seriously it was great right down to the house made salsa on top! We happened to be there at a slow time between lunch and dinner and our waiter was also our bartender and he made one of the best mohitos I have ever had state side! I wasn't going to drink (driving) but, after seeing my sister's, I had to try one! The pork nachos are fabulous: the chips are made fresh, the pork was perfectly cooked and the salsa again was very tasty! We both had salads and the veggies were fresh and I always love house made dressings!   Last time I went to Fuego on a date and we sat outside on the patio; it was very romantic and I ended up with the same server I had before...he is wonderful and he remembered me! My date ordered the ribs and they looked amazing and my tuna steak was tasty with the mango salsa and balsamic reduction! I HIGHLY recommend this place and the happy hour prices are wonderful considering the quality and quantity of the food!   One more thing, this place is a little hard to find tucked back off of Palo Verde Rd. and buried within the middle of a courtyard...but it is well worth the effort to find it!

I love their Ahi Tuna Salad! I usually don't write reviews on chain restaurants, but I had to because I eat here frequently and love their tuna salad. I have been here many time with family, friends, coworkers, and clients and there are not many complaints! The servers are always very attentive, sometimes overly attentive. The ambiance is nice and how the tables are set up makes you feel like you have your own space (not overly crowded). My biggest complaint is that all the desserts are white chocolate desserts...I know it is the 'white chocolate' Grill but, another option would be nice. I love chocolate, but I am not a fan of white chocolate.   On the weekends and Friday, I would recommend having a reservation otherwise the wait could be quite long.  If you are looking for all around good food, good service with a pleasant atmosphere this is a great spot!

Great happy hour!  I came in here after work and was greeted by Aaron, the amazing bartender who told me all about their happy hour specials and gave me good food and drink recommendations.  I ended up with the Ahi Tuna Salad, which had a zing of spice and a very healthy portion of tuna (many places I find tend to skimp on the meat).  I drank one of their happy hour cocktails and then opted for a superbly made dry gin martini :)  Aaron also let me sample one of their summer drink specials.  The manager came by and checked on me, which I thought was very nice and professional.  The bar patrons were also very friendly and had lots of great things to say about Blue Wasabi and one even let me try a piece of their Gordon Gecko Rolls- YUM!  Next time I come here I am going to try the Salmon salad; it looked very tasty...although many of the rolls looked pretty fabulous as well!

Blue Wasabi has great food, prices, and service!  This has become one of my neighborhood favorites.  The Happy Hour is unbeatable.  The bartender will create you a magnificent drink if you are feeling adventurous.  This last visit, I ended up trying a gin martini made with domestic gin from Oregon; it was very unique and delicious.  I had the Salmon Salad and it was YUMMY!  I am usually more of a tuna salad kind of gal, but I have to say I prefer the Salmon salad here.  I also shared the Nemo roll with a friend and it was good.  I give this place 5 stars based on the charming service and prices...this is not the best sushi I have had, but it is still very good!  If you are looking to get away from some of the fine dining in Scottsdale and want a more casual atmosphere with good service and food for a great price, I highly recommend Blue Wasabi!

The Fig Flat Bread with balsamic vinegar reduction is UNIQUE and tastes AMAZING!  The beers on tap are good; I prefer the Konig Weiss.  This is a great place to watch any Euro-sport.  The Happy Hour is not bad!  They have live music on the weekends, many times it is an Irish style band.  It is actually very much so like an Irish pub, meaning it is not full of green shamrocks and leprechauns, but wooden interior with good beer and European sports memorabilia (Rugby, Soccer etc)...You would actually never expect it to look the way it does inside considering it is drowning in an enormous strip mall.  The only reason it gets 4 and not 5 stars is the service can be hit or miss, and the patio is always smokey and the draft blows it inside the bar window/shutter, so many times I have felt like I was suffocating from cigarette smoke.

Yes, I am reviewing a Circle K.  If you need ice chips post-throat surgery Circle K is your place.  Their ice is 'soft', like melt-in-your-mouth not hard-as-a-rock ice, and not like the ice-daggers that come out of your crushed ice dispenser on the fridge at home.  They also have cheap slurpies and Styrofoam cups to keep ice chips from melting!  I never knew these things were important until I needed them.    To top it off the sales associate was extremely nice every time my sister or I went in there.  Even though I sounded like Kermit the frog and looked like death, they didn't make me feel like a weirdo.    This store is not large and it is not a gas station,  but they have a decent selection and cheap drinks if you are on the go.

I miss you Home Depot!  So, I recently moved to another neighborhood, far, far away.  I was spoiled having lived less than a block from this location.  The customer service here always goes above and beyond in all departments.  Many of the people who worked there recognized me, probably as the damsel in distress that ends up in there for random, sometimes comical, problems.  They did a great job of NOT making me feel like an idiot, even though when it comes to fixing some things I probably qualify!    I did not even realize how GREAT I had it at this store, until I had to go to another 'fix-everything' store...I will give them another try before I completely bash them.  I usually try and leave big chains off my Yelp profile, but this location deserves the kudos.    Another important thing to note:  They carry orange soda and coca cola, glass-bottled in Mexico.  I don't know what it is but, it always tastes better out of the bottle. They sell it by the bottle or case too!

I have mixed reviews on this place and I have been here quite a few times for lunch.  Certain things are always great, like the golden pockets, chicken lettuce wraps and the chicken satay!  They usually have great sauces in general; I think most of them are made in house (family owned restaurant).  I have had most of their curries and they are quite yummy, minus the few times it was overly salty!  The peanut dipping sauce with the chicken satay is awesome...Yum!    The 'meh' part of this restaurant:  The service- I think it has ALWAYS been slow and it is like pulling teeth to get a refill on anything.   Portion and Price- I know America does not need another restaurant that serves huge portions, but Osha Thai's portions are rather small and lacking in the meat department.  I guess at least you get lots of yummy sauce for your rice or noodles.  Vegetarians would probably really like this place :)    I will go back just because it is around the corner from my work, but I am not a huge fan in general.  However, I will always order the GOLDEN POCKETS! YUMMY!

Prices are deceiving at Midas and they always try and ridiculously up-sell you.  I had a similar experience with the coupon at Midas as Jeff Y.  I should have listened to the reviews and not gone to this location, but it was on my way to work.    I ended up spending more on an oil change than I ever have before.  I even had a coupon; my dealership is even cheaper than them!  I know most places always add on disposal charges, but they added on about 5 more charges making the oil change cost $14 more than the coupon I brought in.  They told me it was because I need premium products...uhhh, I drive a freaking domestic made, Jeep with a V6 engine WTF!  The only reason they received 2 stars was because my car wasn't sabotaged, I guess they did their job (as far as I know), and the customer service was alright (meaning the guy at the desk was semi-pleasant, but mostly had many excuses).    To make things worse, they were out of coffee in the waiting area, so I had to sit there and watch Kendra on TV without coffee for an hour this morning.  Maybe this was all just a bad nightmare!  Avoid this place like the plague.

This place seems honest, reasonable and efficient!  I must say, I have not actually had my car fixed here yet, but I will soon!!    I called to schedule yesterday around close and they had me in for an appraisal today at noon!  The service was quick and courteous.  My bruises on my Jeep were from a scrape off the beaten path and they were not too bad, so I was debating whether to use my insurance.  He told me about three options and discounts available that all seemed reasonable with/without insurance, which I thought was very honest and professional.  They also said it should only take a day to fix it!  I only gave 4 stars because I have not actually had my car fixed here yet.  I will make sure to give an update!  I forecast a 5 star review in their future :)

I met up with a buddy of mine here last night for a few beverages.  The bartender was very nice and I also met the owner, who you could tell was very involved with making sure customers were happy.  I am not sure if it was because I was really hungry, but the nachos were great even though they didn't look too exciting.  I particularly liked the iced rim around the inner edge of the bar to keep drinks cool; I am sure that is great in the summer.  The patio had a fire going and people who were not playing trivia (was trivia night) seemed to be channelling that way.  Speaking of trivia, some cute older gentleman recruited us to help them with some music trivia and they were excited we could help them out :)  The patrons in general seemed very nice and friendly.  And best of all, beer is cheap!

None of their staff seems very excited to be there ever!  I have been here at all different times and it is always the same humdrum.    This last time I went with a friend of mine for a late dinner.  There was still 40 minutes till close, so it was not like we skipped in at the last second.  You could tell the bartender was not too happy about us showing up.  He offered us drinks and I had to request a menu, then he stood there staring at us while we decided what to order.  We ended up ordering 3 different kinds of tacos.  He failed to ask us if we wanted flour or corn tortillas, and they came out with flour tortillas; I am not a fan of flour tortillas.  It was just not a pleasant dining experience aside from my company.    I can say they have a great taco Tuesday Happy Hour, but otherwise, I would never come here for anything else.

How appropriate for Vino 100 to be my 100th review!  First and foremost the staff here is wonderful and they know their wines.  The bartender was good at making sure my wine glass was loaded and I was happy with the selections.  I asked for a white wine that was not really oaky or sweet and ended up with an amazing pinot grigio...I love Italian wines in general and they picked it for me without even knowing that!    There was also a gentleman playing tunes in the background; I did not catch his name but it was very pleasant background noise.  The patrons are friendly and I left with a bundle of business cards from the many interesting people I met!    If you are looking for a full meal this is not the place, but I had the cheese plate to nibble on and I must say it was a pleasant surprise!! The aged New York cheddar was amazing, and the smoked Gouda was great if you like smoked cheese, and the lavender quartz cheese was visually unique but much milder than it looked.  It was truly perfect to go along with the wine.  You don't have to worry about breaking the bank here either (some wine bars can be steep!); I think glasses range from $6-9.    If you are looking for a fun, entertaining evening at a quaint charming spot with great wine, pleasant patrons and staff for a reasonable price,  I HIGHLY recommend Vino 100!

It was like a vestige as a hummingbird fluttered in the blooming plant in my entryway as I left my Phoenix home for the last time in January.  I remember conscienciously thinking "good bye palm tree, good bye outdoor swimming pool, good bye golf course, good bye", as I drove away and headed for my dismal hotel by the airport.  Though a great adventure was ahead of me, I couldn't help but drop a tear as I watched my last Phoenix sunset for a long time.  It radiated pink and purple that day as if it was putting on a show just for me, with Camelback and the Papagoes as the backdrop.    The people, oh the fabulous people that inhabit Phoenix, come to life in winter.  We have events, parties and conventions that are hard to beat...The Waste Management Open, The Super Bowl and even the nerdy International Science and Engineering Fair.  And I can't leave out the anticipation of spring training Cactus League baseball.  People flock to us in winter be it for the sunshine or whatever, I personally think it is for the nice people.  Don't listen to the foolish news, that loves to talk of our strange politics... I guess that is part of the allure in this wild part of the west as well.    If you venture to the beautiful valley of the sun in winter, don't be foolish and forget a coat.  It may be sunny by day, but until the sun comes up there is frost on the ground.  This is after all a desert and it's mood swings in winter are no joke!    If it chances to rain, a few days later go for a hike.  The blooming cacti and desert flora will fill your nose with the most amazing pungent tropical smells.    As I sit here freezing with a jacket, boots and scarf on at a train station typing this review, the thought of Phoenix in winter makes me smile and warm inside.

This place is dangerous!  This is how my nights usually go when I go to SanTan:   Somebody, "Hey lets go grab a brew at San Tan" Somebody else, "Okay, sounds good."    Sounds innocent doesn't it!  Fast-forward 5hours, many beers and new acquaintances later, and we are dancing at one of the less than fine establishments down the road.  It seriously never fails!    I love their beer, especially the Devil's Ale and their stout.   Good beer+good people=Good times!  I will continue to come back!

Jose is indeed my tailor!  I have been through a gauntlet of so-so, and horrible tailors in the valley, but this place is outstanding!  The repair I needed was not an easy one either (bandage dress), but they made it look spiffy and new.  This place is cash-only, like most 'mom and pap' tailors.  Jose's was very reasonable and had my dress repaired within a day.  What more could you ask for from a tailor?  They are now my go to place for my tailoring needs.

I am a little disappointed in myself for not remembering our bartender's name! He has been at Roka since the beginning and helped the place get up and rolling. He knew every detail of the menu and recommended some great food to try. Even though the bar was extremely busy, he still managed to be very attentive and not seem flustered! Also one of the cocktail waitresses was extraordinarily nice as she picked up our slew of appetizer plates. The service here is seriously top notch!   The crowd was also fun! I was there for a Yelp event this last time though so I am probably being biased...but I have been here before and there always seems to be a good vibe.   Last and probably most importantly the FOOD: the BUTTERFISH TATAKI with white asparagus is unique and AMAZING! The Kobe beef dumplings I could eat all week for every meal and probably not get tired of them. I have never sat at the sushi bar, but it is definitely on my 'To-Do' list because not only does the food taste great here, but the presentation is quite impressive. I would love to see Roka Akor's chefs in action!

I finally sat at to the sushi bar!  I now know I never want a job cracking open oysters; that guy should get a bonus!  Also, Roka Akor knows how to make some beautiful dishes!     I should start off by saying Roka Akor has great food, BUT I am starting to come to the conclusion that I just need to come to Roka Akor for happy hour or the dinner entrees, not the sushi.  Their rolls (we had the Serrano Chili and Spicy Tuna) were honestly not that exciting and on the small side, but they tasted good and were solidly made.  I wish I had gone with my instincts and tried the Dynamite Scallop Roll, because we saw one being made later at the bar and it looked yummy.  The warm Wagyu roll sounded interesting to try next time too.    I ALWAYS get the BUTTERFISH TATAKI; it is seriously amazing.  But, I should also say you get 5 small pieces of fish for $11, and it would never fill you up.  The octopus salad was delicious but came on a plate the size of a tea saucer with more greens than octopus (maybe 5 pieces of octopus); most octopus salad I have had, the majority of it is octopus.  As Jared R. said the Waygu Kimchi dumplings were not as exciting as all the other things we ate.  I think you just come to expect that WOW factor at Roka Akor and they don't deliver that.    I checked in on Yelp and they offered the Yuzu Mousse dessert with a beverage purchase, which was a pleasant surprise!  The mousse was light and fluffy with the perfect amount of lemon; definitely not rich and over-baring.  It came with a raspberry drizzle that complemented it beautifully.    Not to be cliche, but one thing that was kind of noticeable to my date and I, was out of the 8 people in the open kitchen, one was Japanese.    As for our service this time it was okay.  The guy I went with had never been to Roka Akor and had quite a few questions because they have a unique menu that lacks descriptions, which is fine when you have a knowledgeable waiter- but we didn't. I almost wonder if our waiter was relatively new, because he did not describe things very well and most things were described with adjectives like 'good' or 'great' and he basically just said 'I think I would go with that.'  It really didn't give you much to go on, especially since the menu does not have descriptions.  But, he got the job done and he was fast and pleasant, so I am not really complaining.    What to take home with you: Roka Akor has beautiful, yummy food.  The prices are high and I think you can get just as good, if not better, sushi other places. ORDER THE BUTTERFISH TATAKI. They also have one of the greatest happy hours in town, with outstanding, reasonable food options!

I think this is my new favorite Italian restaurant!  The service and food were amazing!!! We had a 3 course meal and it was all perfect.  I loved the calamari (not overly fried or breaded).  The manager had a great knowledge of the wines they had available and the wine list was also impressive.  I have not tried their 'backdoor pizza'  but I intend on trying it soon!  If it is anything like the food in the restaurant, I am sure it will be awesome.

I am a big fan of Crust!  I have been here twice and I have met a different owner each time (I think there are two or three partners in this restaurant).  All of the pizzas are made from scratch and I love the sauce!  I have never had anything but the pizza (it is the specialty after all), but all the other menu items I have seen come from the kitchen look fabulous as well.  Another great thing about Crust is the wine list (great wines and an extensive list), not to mention they give you a fairly liberal pour!

Corned beef and cabbage taquitos...sounds crazy, so I had to try it...it was GREAT!  The $3 dollar Carlsberg big draft beers were also GREAT!  The bartender was GREAT as well!  If those 3 reasons aren't good enough to try out Tim Finnegans, then go because I said so :)

This is a wonderful neighborhood hardware store!  The customer service is great and the people in the store seem to know their stock very well.  I came here looking for hardware to hang something; I ended up walking out the door with all kinds of things I needed for other projects: RIT dye, a new shower curtain liner, STP fuel injector fluid for my old car, and free pop corn to boot!  I will be back!

This is an amazing trail for many reasons!  First and probably most importantly, as the name says, this trail is a wash, which means there is tons of wildlife along the trail (animals love to hangout in washes).  Also, this trail connects with many other trails, if you want to extend your hike.  Another great thing about this trail and many of the others is that they loop, so you get to explore new ground the whole hike.  At the trail head there are restrooms and sometimes volunteers with information and maps.  They also have guided educational hikes on the Lost Dog trail (generally on the weekend).  I usually mountain bike this trail; it has some switchbacks and a bit rocky in some areas so I wouldn't necissarily recommend that for everyone.  The Ringtrail loop is a bit easier for mountain bikers.  Lost Dog does get busy during the tourist season and most weekends.  If you are mountain biking, to avoid a crowded trail, I would recommend doing it early in the morning, on the weekends, or during the week.

Sushi-AMAZING!  I have been coming here for almost 2 years (moved here a little over 2 years ago).  I have been to many Sushi joints including the 5 star posh restaurants all the way to the dingy.  This is by far the best in the Phoenix area.  The seafood is always very fresh, and they have market fresh specials all the time.  I always get something off the hand written board, which are the chef's specials or the items that are market fresh.  You should definitely sit at the sushi bar if seats are available.  The service at the tables is not the best, they don't have a very broad alcoholic beverage selection, the decor also not fabulous, the dingy strip mall surrounding it and all the pawn shops-awful....but, we came for sushi and WOW.

I pulled in here in desperate need of some gas at about 8pm on a Friday and the service station (mechanic/oil change etc) was still open.  One of the friendly attendants saw that my windshield was horrendous looking (from a road trip a few weeks ago), and offered to clean it for me....I had flash backs from days of old, when there was always human gas attendants outside to help fill your car up and clean your windshield.  So nostalgic and pleasant, I was compelled to write a review :)

I just had an amazing time at this salon!! My Stylist was James and he is awesome and made my hair look and feel great. His assistant, Jamie, was equally amazing and did an outstanding job styling and finishing my hair...unfortunately he is being transferred to the Chandler location, but he seems excited about it so I am happy for him.   I had a groupon for $100 worth of services and only spent $80(I am not one to freak out if I don't use the whole groupon), and the receptionist let me know I could get an eyebrow wax for pretty much free, so I went for it. The esthetician did a very thorough and clean job and it was not painful or irritating at all!   I highly recommend this place, however I should note James is also a level 4 stylist so I cannot speak for the lower tiers...But, Jamie who was assisting/training, did an AMAZING job styling my hair! So, I still stand by the recommendation regardless of tier. The salon is lovely and posh inside and they have a large store full of fun accessories and supplies. I noticed some Yelpers said the receptionists were snooty; I did not have that problem at all and they were actually quite helpful and polite. If you want to leave a salon/spa looking and feeling fabulous, Dolce is a good place to go!

James did it again!  He usually just covers up my pestery grey hair.  I had an appointment for a touch-up, but I was in major need of a trim so I figured I would let James have a hack at it (literally).  I walked out of Dolce looking fabulous as always!  I received many compliments on my hair that evening and over the last week; he made me look and feel like a rockstar!  The salon is not what I would call a 'relaxing place', as this location is very busy and crowded.  I, 5 star, recommend it though based on the fact that I always walk out with my locks looking awesome!

Christopher's has half priced wines by the glass at happy hour!! And did I mention they have a book of wines, not a list, which makes choosing a few rather challenging!   The food was fantastic! I had a hamburger with Gruyere cheese and mushrooms, which I gulped down in about 5 minutes because I was hungry and it was YUMMY!   After 3 hours of sipping wine with new and old friends at the food bar, I decided it was time for dessert! The Chef, Christopher himself, brought me out an impressive chocolate tower!! I am still dreaming of it today!   I had a wonderful and pleasant time at Christopher's. You can tell the staff goes above and beyond to make their patrons happy and they are very friendly!  I definitely need to come back and have a 'real' meal. From what I saw from the 'kitchen' bar, I will not be disappointed.  And I am not sure there is a better happy hour in town considering the quality for the price!

The W is definitely one of the more 'hip' hotels in Old Town, if you are looking for a more lively vibe, as opposed to relaxing, this is probably where you should stay.  I have to say all staff I have ever encountered here from the valet guys, to the bartenders, servers etc have always been outstanding.  The rooms are nice and modern and they serve their customers needs around the clock.  It is within walking distance to Old Town nightlife and shopping at the boutiques, galleries and Scottsdale Fashion Square mall.    I am a big fan of Sushi Roku, the restaurant attached to the W. I have always had great service, food and cocktails there.  With this prime location you are also within a rock throw of many other fine dining establishments, cute local cafes and bars.    The pool parties in the summer are rocking with DJs spinning tunes, and Scottsdale's finest (or as some call them Snotsdale's finest) prancing around 95% naked, and possibly 10% filled with plastic.  At night this same pool area transforms itself into an energized nightlife spot.    My last visit to the W I stopped in on a random Sunday evening to grab a cocktail with a friend and I was impressed.  There were a quite a few patrons enjoying their Sunday Fundays and the bartender made sure to keep the vibe going.  It was some of the best people watching I have done in a while... The lobby bar had cool lounge music vibing in the background.  There were some hotel patrons with some escort-ish looking guests, which entertained us while time with our cocktails passed.    I end up here on rather impromptu occassions, but every time has never been a disappointment.

I love Sushi and have tried many Sushi places in the area, but for some reason kept missing out on Sushi Roku...well, a nice gentleman decided to take me there for my birthday dinner and what a treat!!  We were seated at a cozy booth with a view of the sushi bar, which is perfect if you want an intimate dining experience but you want to observe the excitement of the sushi bar in action.    Our waiter greeted us right away and he was outstanding throughout the whole evening!  Unfortunately I did not catch his name.  He told us about the Arizona Restaurant week menu and the alcohol and the 'real' menu...I had major conflicts of interest!  We ended up opting for a feast of a little bit of everything Hahah! We ordered two options on the AZ restaurant week menu because the variety of the options was impressive!  Seemed like a great way to try a bit of everything since we had never eaten there!  And I had to try one of the Signature rolls; when I go to Sushi places I like to try their 'specialty' or something weird and unique!  As for the drinks I ordered white wine (Citra Pinot Grigio, Italy) to go with the mounds of fish coming our way and my date opted for kirin Ichiban beer, and the AZ restaurant week menu surprised us with a complimentary Roku Fusion Cocktail!  The Breakdown:   The signature roll we chose was the Tako Roll: Spicy Octopus; it was my FAVORITE thing of the night!  I find sometimes at sushi restaurants when they say spicy it is just more like a bit of a zing that you have to spice up with Wasabi, but Sushi Roku wasn't lying!  It came with spicy tuna dressing the top of the octopus roll and an interesting spicy reddish sauce drizzled across the top...Delicious!!! Great way to start the evening!   1st course:  I chose 'Appetizers From the Sea' because I love fish, which came with Tuna Tataki, Salmon Sashimi and Tai Usuzukuri.  And my date chose 'Appetizers from the Farm' which entailed Kobe beef skewers, Fillet Mignon wrapped Asparagus, and Crispy Ji-Dori Chicken.  My favorites from each (yes we shared) were the Salmon Tataki, which had an amazing sauce (Truffle Tamari Soy) and the Kobe Beef Skewer (black pepper sauce)...my date liked the Tuna Tataki (close 2nd for me) and the asparagus wrapped with fillet Mignon (amazing).  We both decided we would forever pass on the Tai Usuzukuri (very blah) and the Crispy Ji-Dori chicken (over fried and just blah compared to the others).    2nd course: I opted for the 5 pieces of Roku Signature Style Sushi (Tai, Yellowtail, Salmon, Albacore, Tuna), accompanied with 3 pieces of Spicy Salmon Cut Roll and 3 pieces of California Cut Roll.  It was all quite amazing and a great assortment!  I loved the albacore sashimi!  But it was all good because I love tuna in general!  My date ordered the Grilled sirloin steak "Japonaise" with Japanese style potatoes; it was a pleasant surprise because we both didn't know what to expect.  It was a big tender steak with a unique gingery sauce and the potatoes and green beans that accompanied it were also Delicious.  Both plates left the table empty!    And yes still going: 3rd course:  DESSERT! The waiter brought out both the Mini Chocolate Volcano and a Fresh Fruit Sorbet!  They were both tasty but we could unfortunately barely eat them because we were so full!  The Sorbet tasted very fresh and fruity with beautiful fresh strawberries.  I love chocolate, so the Chocolate Volcano was decadently rich and wonderful, in which I dipped the fresh Strawberries from the other dessert; YUM!   Oh and when the surprise Roku Fusion drink showed up we were amazed at such a great Restaurant Week deal for $30!  BTW they did not skimp on the alcohol ;)  If you ever want to try Sushi Roku, Arizona Restaurant Week is a great time to go because you get a great variety from the menu!  It was a wonderful experience for us when we were just expecting to try a few different rolls and drinks!!  I should also note the Tako Roll (spicy octopus) was not included with the Restaurant Week special.    I know I will be back because their anniversary falls on the same day as my birthday (September 26th) and everything on the menu is half off!!! WooHoo!    And one last thanks to my anonymous server!  I hope I get to enjoy your service again! As much as the sushi bar looks enjoyable and fun; I wouldn't have traded that for such an excellent dining experience!

I went here last night with some friends and I have to say, I am impressed!! It is refreshing to find a lounge like this in the Phoenix area that is not full of plastic. This reminded me of a bar you would go to in NYC; the stairway leads up to a narrow, dark, and modern room with an eclectic bunch of people filling a space that is standing room only. Oh yeah, and the bartenders know their stuff.   This place also has a great drink selection. I am not a beer connoisseur, but I am always a fan of trying something I have never had before. So when I saw Unibroue La FIn Du Monde on the menu, I had to order it. Really, I just wanted to order a "Uni-brow" and I got a good laugh from the bartenders. It was however a great beer :) Aside from my new sampling, they also had a great selection of Weissbier, of which I am a huge fan. I was driving so I did not get the opportunity to try the mixed drinks, but they looked phenomenal!   The atmosphere was outstanding in general with a fun vibe and good music. The crowd was entertaining to watch and a great mix of people. You could come dressed up or down to this joint and you would be just fine.   I am definitely coming back to this spot in the future :)

So I have been here quite a few times in the last month or so and it is not as exciting anymore. Last time some of the clientele was quite rude to my friend (yeah I know there are B's everywhere, but she was impressive), another time a guy almost puked on my feet while waiting for the bathroom, and one time the waitress just plain sucked at a whole new level. I guess I am over this place. I still like the lounge appeal/decor inside, but the rest of it is just rather BLAH!

I love this spot and hike it at least once a week.  There are lots of different trails and few people.  The views are great, hence the name Lookout Mountain.  There are also good mountain biking trails.  It is a short trail to the summit, but steep.  Depending on the trails you take you can make it short and sweet (20-30minutes) or a few hours.

This is my favorite pool to swim laps at in Scottsdale!  It is not as nice as McDowell Mountain Aquatics Center, but it has a much mellower atmosphere and fewer people!  The staff is also very pleasant.  I really love this place when they have the 50 meter pool open for lap swim (but it is usually divided into 2x25 yard pools).  Cactus pool also has a nice diving well, but I have never used the boards, so I can't attest to their quality.  My only complaint about cactus is the women's locker room.  It is rather small, and I have seen more than a few people take a plunge due to slippery floors, but luckily it has never been me!  The prices are reasonable and if you are a Scottsdale resident it is even cheaper.  Rates do go up in the winter to heat the pool, but it is always perfect, around 80 degrees, so I am not complaining.  If you are looking for a chill lap pool, where it is just you and the water, and does not feel inundated with public swims/lessons/water aerobics etc, this is your place!

This place is great!  I went to Postino on a Tuesday night with a friend and it was pretty busy.  We were seated right away and the service was great from start to finish.  We only ordered bruschetta and wine.  The bruschetta was amazing and the wine was definitely drinkable.  We ate inside, but the patio did look very cozy...next time!

So, I experienced the patio!   I had great service as always!  It was everything I had hoped it would be warm, inviting and in general awesome...too bad I can not say the same for my date LOL!  Maybe you will have better luck with your company, but the patio is very plesant and you can not beat the $20 special on wine and brushetta on Mondays and Tuesdays!  If you go on one of those days, I suggest going after nine when the crowds/parking are not so ridiculous.

First of all many of you are WRONG!! This is not a Frank Lloyd Wright building! It was designed by Albert Chase McArthur, who was also a great architect of that time. However, there are some pieces of work by Frank Lloyd Wright inside the building (most notably the glass window in the entryway titled 'Saguaros'). Anyway this place is beautiful and great for any formal occasion. I went there recently for High Tea and it was fabulous. As many other reviews have said, this place is quite 'swanky' and many reviewers have commented variably on the service. This is not the soft, warming service of a place such as a Kimpton Resort; it has a more proper sense of service. Regardless they are very respectful and anything you ask of them is accommodated. You really can't go wrong at the Biltmore; the building and landscape are gorgeous, service is great, and the food is good!

When somebody writes about a laundromat and says, "I love this place" and "This is the Cadillac of laundromats", then that is the kind of laundromat for me!    My stupid washer decided to crap out on the Sunday between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, so by the time I bought a new washing machine I had to wait 10days to get my washer delivered!! Boo!  Of course I had been out of town three times in the last three weeks so I had a monstrous load of laundry and my dog was sick so I had some nasty smelling towels, so I decided I just needed to suck it up and venture to a laundromat.  After lots of Yelp searches, review reading and phone calls to laundromats I decided on Eco Laundry.  My research paid off!    Eco Laundry has lots of washers with multiple capacities:    1load washer- $1.25 2 load washer- $2.50 3 load washer- $3.75 5load washer- $4.50 6load washer- $6.00  They are all arranged in a very organized fashion with large signs to help you find what you are looking for.    They also have two sizes of driers:   Standard load dryer:  $0.25 for 8minutes I believe 50lb load commercial drier: $0.50 for initial 4minutes and I think $0.25 for every additional 4 after it starts.  Since I was making the trek to the laundromat, I decided to do my comforter and all my dog's blankets and stuff.  I had around 10-12 loads that I washed and dried for about $30 in 2hours!  Honestly the most pain in the butt part of it was unloading it and putting it all away when I made it home!  As far as the interior goes it was as pleasant as a laundromat could be.  Brightly lit room with Flat screen TVs throughout, clocks on the walls, stocked up vending machine, soap machine, and coin dispenser.  Oh and FREE wifi!  The cleanliness was far superior than any other laundromat I have been in.  The bathroom is kept locked, which I assume is for cleanliness and anti-loitering reasons, but you can easily ask the attendant for the key. Speaking of the attendants, they have great customer service!  When I called and while I was there, the attendants were very informative and pleasant.  The clientele was a combo of college students, a few couples and some randoms doing larger household items like comforters.  I ended up meeting a very pleasant couple from NYC and we chatted while we handled our laundry.  All around I have absolutely no complaints.  If I ever need a laundromat  in the valley of the sun, Eco Laundry will forever be my spot!     Oh and make sure to bring cash!  All machines operate on quarters only.

BUzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Berry!  Aside from the catchy name, the cute building and interior, this place actually has pretty sweet smoothies and customer service too!    I meandered in here this morning, minorly hungover, in need of caffeine and rejuvenation and Buzzberry had the solution:  raspberry-strawberry classic smoothie with a shot of 'energy'...blamo I feel much better.  I probably should have gone with the 'original' which is 100% fruit as opposed to the 'classic' because I like my stuff unsweetened as my 'name' says...because I'm so sweet LOL!  But my brain wasn't firing on all cylinders this morning, so I ended up with the sweet one.  It was still delicious though and you could tell it was all made fresh!  Yum!  The price is a bit high (about $6 a smoothie) and quantity is smaller than a Jamba Juice Original, but it is local and all fresh, so in my book it is worth it.  And see below because this place really is pretty darn outstandingly awesome!  The lady at the counter (unfortunately I did not catch the name) was very informative and very nice!  Like, SOOO nice I would have wanted to sit down and have a coffee with her; I mean a Buuzzzzzzberrry coffee.  Anyway, she gave me a punch card and because it was my first time in, she gave me TWO punches!  How awesome is that?  Not to mention, most punch cards have about 8/10 punches and it only takes 5 to get a free BuzzzzBerry smoothie!  She also talked me into signing up for the email list which sends out deals....who doesn't like a DEAL this day and age?  I told her I moved into a house down the road because my big goofy dog needed a yard and lots of other blah blah blah and what did she say...Bring in your DOG!  The place is dog friendly!     Can this place seriously get any better????? YES!  It can!  They make all their pastries fresh and from scratch every day.  To top it off the awesome lady at the counter remembered my name, as I walked out the door, and said, "Bye, Lisa, come again." And guess what, I will!

Why am I always sprinting through this long, logistically-horrible airport?  They never schedule enough time in between flights to allow you to trek the loooooooooooooooooooong concourses and connecting shopping hallways!!  And for the record this is coming from a fast walker with long ass legs...Not to mention if you make it on time your flight is always held for people trying to make it.  Too bad I never get the time to sit down in the cool, white rocking chairs I am always sprinting by because I am rushing to my connecting flight...What a mess.

It started off as a crush, but now I think I am in love.  I went here for the first time on a  'Girl's Night Out'.  It was fun, with a great atmosphere, pretty people and good service.  Then there was a loooooong gap in time and Mabel's had faded away as a mere distant memory of a cute bar I once went to.    Then, finally, a few happy hours and I eventually met Chele.  She is the amazing bartender who wooed me many an evening at Mabel's with her bartending prowess and dazzling gin drinks.  Unfortunately, for all of you reading this now, she has left for New York city to concur the bar scene there and I wish her the best.   My favorite Chele conversation:  "I have always worked in speakeasy kind of places since I started bartending, so I know lots of old-timer drinks and martinis, but the down side is I don't really know the 'younger' drinks."  And I say, "Well, what do you mean?" And Chele replies, "Well, this college girl once ordered a Tic-Tac, and I asked what is in a Tic-Tac.  And the college girl replied in her most valley voice possible, "how do you NOT know what is in a tic-tac, it is an 'ASU-thing'''...and what did Chele say??? "Well honey this is not ASU"  Priceless, and what makes it better is I don't think Chele is much older than 25!  Man, I am going to miss her.  So, this is not even the climax yet.  I also stumbled in another random Tuesday evening to witness the filming of Mob Wives.  Not that I am a Mob Wives fan but it was funny to watch 'reality' TV being arranged...  Finally, the point this relationship really turned into love was right before Christmas.  I was out on a cold Thursday night with 2 of my girlfriends, whom I had not seen in a long time.  The beginning of the night had been ruined at another drinking establishment, and the evening seemed to have been forgone and Mabel's was our last hope.  We must have looked defeated as we walked in the door, because after we sat down a fine gentleman came over to ask what we were drinking.  I looked at him closely and thought, he does not look like a server...it was one of the owners.  He introduced us to our fabulous waitress, Christina I think, and our evening was perfect from that point forth.  We also met the General Manager who was just as outstanding.  After 3 hours of many cocktails, shooters, good times and a cab ride later, I knew I had found my new favorite bar in Old Town.

This place is fabulous!  I just moved into this neighborhood and needed a gas jug to put gas in my old VW, so I could start it up (had not run in 5 months).  They let me borrow it for free and also offered to help if I had problems!  The shop always seems to be busy, which speaks to their great and honest customer service.    I have also noticed that their gas prices always seem to be at least 5 cents lower than any other station in the area.  The men in the shop are always very pleasant too.  This looks like my new go-to car maintenance shop!

This Chase bank is outstanding!  Their customer service is always very pleasant.  I have always been greeted at the entryway.  They have lots of employees so you really don't ever wait too long.  The bankers are extremely helpful whether a screwed up account or just notarizing a document...they really strive to make the customer happy.  I think this may be the best banking location I have ever 'banked' with!  If I can't accomplish what I need on-line, I rarely call Chase's annoying automated line, it is honestly easier and more pleasant to come in here!  Oh and they have suckers :)

What happened?!  I know I haven't been to Jamba Juice in a while, but the cups got smaller, prices got bigger and the 'original' recipes vanished.  Shame on you!  I don't think I am ever coming back again.

This place is VERY cool!  I went here for the 1st year anniversary celebration this last Saturday.  The entertainment outside on the main courtyard was excellent!  I also did part of the tour through the museum (it is huge); it is practically impossible to take in the whole museum in one day!  This place is very well done.  The headset technology allows you to hear instruments from all around the world as you look at them physically.  The staff is polite and very informative.  There are great interactive areas of the museum as well.  I highly recommend this place for anyone, even if you are not a musician this place is VERY interesting and unique!

Scratch my last review.  If I could give 0 stars I would, but 1 is the minimum.  Well, I guess I can give 1 star for the poor service guy that had to deal with my pent up frustrations from enduring the dis-functional service at Airpark Jeep.  Where to begin:  They never entered in the $2300 service/maintenance/extended warranty plan that I bought with my Jeep into my vehicle profile at the service shop.  So I paid for 2.5 years worth of oil changes etc. for no reason (even after I claimed I had one in the beginng)...then I found the agreement when I moved 5 months ago and I was not reimbursed the full amount because they pay a reduced price.  For their failure to get off their lazy tush and see if I had a service plan, I ended up paying more for oil changes...Sure am glad I bought their STUPID $2300 maintenance plan.  Epic failure #2:  The manager failed to call me back (called 3 times) after I found the paperwork for the warranty and asked about my plan and how to get reimbursed properly.   Epic Failure #3:  I called the director of the whole dealership to complain about the manager that never called me back and their stupid warranty 'service' plan, and he never called me back either.   Epic Failure #4:  My car has 43, 200 miles on it and for the last 4 oil changes and 1 battery change everyone failed to mention anything about the 30,000 mile preventative maintenance (which could have been done gradually over multiple visits), so today when I went in for an oil change and new brake pads, they informed my I had $941 of service that needed to be done because the 30000 mile stuff wasn't taken care of (they had 13000 to make me aware of the preventative maintenance)....last time I checked that is why you take your car in for regular maintenance so you distribute such costs over time and take care of your car so you don't end up having a PROBLEM!!!!   Bottom Line:  Don't go to Airpark Jeep EVER for anything! The service department here is awful and I have no respect for the guy who sold me the crappy service plan either.  And the management seems to be worthless considering they never call anyone back.  I have bought 3 new cars and 2 used cars and have never had any problems like this from any other dealership.    Also, I hate writing reviews that trash a place; sometimes people have a bad day...my experience with Airpark has been bad for 2.75 years.  Congratulations Airpark Jeep you earned yourself a hard to achieve 1 star review!

Airpark Jeep is getting better.  After they managed to screw up my bill again, the manager fixed everything and was extremely appologetic, which I appreciate because I have gotten loads of excuses in the past.  They also managed to find my service plan in the system, but my problem wasn't covered.  Luckily my problem was covered under a warranty.  Anyway, my service was much better, but there is still a lot of room for improvement.  And whoever answers the phone could work on being more polite.  People having car problems are already having a bad day and we don't need the sass.

El Chorro has amazing views of Camelback Mountain, and is a solid restaurant with what I would call traditional American fare, but the one downside is the rather exorbitant prices, which I guess is to be expected in Paradise Valley.    I initially came into El Chorro for a drink with some friends, and I always like to browse the menu at restaurants whether I am eating or not...then I saw one of their 'classics' and had flashbacks to my mother's amazing homemade beef stroganoff.  Now days in the land of trendy, fusion, hip restaurants such things are not very typical to a menu, so I had to try it and see if it could even compare to my mother's version.  Most stroganoffs at restaurants tend to be on the very creamy side and my mother's is heavier on the au jus from the meat and flavor of the mushrooms, so I asked our amazing bartender if it could be modified (also because I am not a fan of ultra creamy sauces anyway); he obliged and informed me the Chef was in house that evening and he would go consult him.  The bartender came back with outstanding news that the chef would cook it up himself :)    While my meal was in the 'developmental stage' in the back, I finally made it around to deciding on a cocktail.  The bartender was pleasant and asked about my favorite kind of beverage.  I told him I was a big fan of gin, and he said he had the perfect cocktail for me to try: the French 75.  It was a lovely perfumey, bubbly drink that wasn't too sweet or strong (many gin drinks are heavy on the liquor).  For all you people that think gin tastes like pine needles, you need to try some Nolet's Gin; it is more like an English rose garden.  I wouldn't drink that drink regularly, but it was very delicious, flavorful and perfect for good conversation and sipping.  All of my friends tried it and thought it was amazing and couldn't believe there was gin in it haha!   Then my meal arrived and wow!! It looked and smelled amazing and amazingly like my mom's stroganoff.  My friends even said it smelled awesome and I was nice and shared!  It was a HUGE pasta plate full of yummy egg noodles with tender pieces of beef, and a nice thick caramelized brownish mushroom/onion au jus reduction sauce with a bit of cream...perfect for me!  It was garnished with fresh sugarsnap peas, carrots and one of their yummy rolls!  I ate it along with my friends and wiped up every last drop with the roll.  Definitely the best stroganoff I have ever had in a restaurant!    I will definitely be back for a drink here; the mixologists are wonderful (so good, I can't even call them bartenders).  The menu prices are steep, so I would probably only come here on a special occasion for the food.  But, I must say this would be a great date spot or a place for visitors from out of town because the views of Camelback Mountain and the surrounding neighborhood/architecture are beautiful.

Why I like this location:  Not a very high traffic Fascinations so it is not awkward perusing around.  The other fascinations close to me is right near strip club row in Old Town and let's just say there is always a whole lot going on in there.  The sales people here are always very friendly and helpful, but not in an overbearing inappropriate manner.  And my absolute favorite thing about this store is they have lots of lingerie, though some of it is overpriced...Some people have shoe or handbag problems!  Also, they have some clubbing apparel that is actually pretty cute, if you are into the more risque club look ;)

Plate 1: Chocolate donut, strawberries, blue berries, blackberries, pineapple, orange, grapefruit, 2 pork egg rolls, a maple bar and a yoplait yogurt.  Plate 2: steak, sausage, bacon and icecream.  Beverages: Water, orange juice, coffee and a diet coke.  Servers and bussers: SUPERB!  Cost: $9.99+tip on Saturday morning...AMAZING!  So obviously I am not going to become known for my food pairings, but the point is they have all kinds of stuff to meet anybody's desires at the Wandering Horse Buffet.  I think I only tried about 1/4th of all the options available!  It also all seemed very fresh.  The donuts even seemed to be made fresh in house as opposed stale ones that have been sitting around and sourced from somewhere else.  The fruit bar was my favorite.  I was too stuffed for the Mexican breakfast bar and cereal bar, but they also looked appetizing.     I am not really a buffet person, but I definitely left fat and happy!  If you leave this buffet hungry, it is your own fault.

So not sure how this happened, but my passport was never checked before I departed!!!!  I also had one of the strangest security experiences ever.  I asked the gentleman by the bins at the beginning of security if I needed to take of my jewellery because there was obviously a metal detector and a body scanner to go through, and it wasn't clear who was going where.  He said I could leave the jewellery on.  Then I was asked to go through the metal detector by the guy directing traffic.  I thought, hmmm, well this will surely go off with my chunky sterling silver ring and the penant around my neck...and it did.  Then I was asked to go through the scanner, which I have no problem with for the record.  I wait to be cleared and they were like "maam we will need to search you", and I gave them, I'm sure, an interesting look.  So this lady starts to pat me down with the two other security dudes staring at me.  Then she pulls up my shirt a bit disturbingly high and put her hand down my pants, like her whole fukcing hand.  At that point I became VERY direct and said, "YOU need to stop NOW and get your manager to finish."  She asked why, and I said, "I travel a LOT and this is the most ridiculous set up I have ever experienced, not to mention you are out of line.  I have an underwire bra on, rivets on my jeans, a ring and a necklace on, nothing in my pockets; I should not even be getting searched."  Magically one of the two dudes standing there, gave me the nod to carry on.    The reason this airport managed to be a two star review after that insanity above:  Edinburgh Airport has many busses and trams to get you there so it is easily accessible.  Also the customer service in the Duty Free area was spectacular.  One of the perks of flying though Scotland is whisky tasting in the airport, and trust me I was doing some whisky tasting in Duty free after my security experience!!

I should clarify I don't go to casinos for the casino, I'm not much of a gambler...I usually mosey into these places for breakfast buffets, shows or pool parties!  The Talking Stick is definitely one of the nicer casinos in the area.  My one complaint about the pool is due to it being East of the Hotel/Casino you don't really get to enjoy the sunset from the pool.  The Saturday morning buffet at the Wandering Horse is amazing for $12 you can gorge yourself with all kinds of wonderful food!  Another thing to note, if you are gambling drinks are not free...some of my buddies were complaining about that once.  I still have yet to try their fine dining restaurant Orange Sky, but I have heard it is delicious with great views.  It is definitely on my 'to do' list.  The penthouse bar on the top floor is hit or miss; the view is great but sometimes it is not exactly hopping.  I recommend going after a show or an event.

GREAT BAR!  I have been here twice now and have no complaints!  The bar tender (Chris) is outstanding and nice to look at...He is great at keeping the patrons happy and keeping the conversation going!  The Lounge also carries my favorite gin (Hendrick's), which is not extraordinarily common in bars around here.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the people here always seem friendly.  It has never been crowded when I am there, which is fine by me.  I am almost afraid to give such an outstanding review, in fear of it becoming popular, because I like this little gem that Christina P. introduced me to just the way it is!

Have you had a bad day?  I did, so I went to Yogurtini and it put a little ray of sunshine in my cloudy day.  Nothing like soft serve with yummy toppings to put a smile on your face.  I particularly love this joint (compared to others) because they have mini dark chocolate raspberry truffles for a topping! :)

Brazilian waxing is rather intimate to say the least, but the ladies at Rio do a great job of making you feel comfortable. My esthetician's name was Kelly and she did a wonderful job of making me feel at ease in a rather awkward and painful time, as well as a beautiful, clean job downstairs! I also have very sensitive skin and my skin did not react too badly to the wax they use at this salon. The prices are the best I have seen in town; I will be back in for sure!

Who doesn't like secret gardens?  Especially secret gardens that are lovely, romantic with food that is charmingly delectable!   You don't even feel like you are right next to a large city with a farm and South Mountain as a backdrop.    I made a reservation on the patio because my sister was in town from the Bay Area and I knew she would want to enjoy our warm AZ weather and watch the sunset.  Honestly if you are coming here I would just sit outside, the house is cute, but the patio is much better.  The server placed us in a perfect spot shaded by palms overlooking the koi pond and not far from the fire!  Gentlemen, talk about a place to bring a hot date, would definitely set the mood for me!  But, it was also perfect to laugh and catch up with the sister too!    We ordered a cheese board to start and a bottle of Salneval Albarino to cleanse the pallet!  I HIGHLY recommend the Cypress Grove Midnight Moon cheese!  I am not even a cheesy kind of person, but I could eat a whole wheel of that stuff.    This is going to sound funny, but I came to this lovely restaurant with a big black/purple/blue/violet eye-cheek from an accident and trust me for the last 2 weeks I had been getting domestic violence and thug looks from various 'service providers'...  Well our waitress Megan didn't even bat an eye at my whacked face and my glorious bruise was even on her serving side!  So extra bonus points for that, which is why I rounded my 4.5 star rating up to 5 instead of down to 4.  So after asking our poor server a million questions about the menu, because it is really hard to decide, as everything looks good and unique, we finally ordered.  I opted for the seasonal house special: hand made ravioli.  It was a spinach ravioli topped with an interesting lemon cream sauce, with almonds on top.  The raviolis were delicious, the sauce was quite good, and the almonds brought it all together.  I think I was expecting a little bit more POW to the dish, but it was still very unique and delicious.    I have to say my sister chose the right dish!  The New York strip with Red Chimichurri Sauce is AMAZING!  The thing they don't tell you on the menu is it comes in a corn puree of sorts that is mouthwatering!!! See picture.  It sounds weird to go with a steak, but it completely made the dish and set that steak apart from your typical steak at a nice restaurant.  I was actually trying to talk my sis into one of the other dishes and she trumped me...I am glad she did!!    The corn puree sauce was so good we asked the server what was in it and she said she would ask the chef who was in house.  She wrote the recipe on a note for us!! Sorry I promised not to divulge her secrets.  But the last ingredient was cute:  Love :)  If you are skimming just do the following:  Sit on the patio, select Cypress Grove Midnight Moon cheese on the cheese board, somebody order the steak.  You will come back for more and if you are on a date you will get lucky!

CARPACCIO!  EAT IT!  If raw beef doesn't freak you out, and maybe even if it does (Tanzy's may change your mind), try the carpaccio!  The fried capers and arugula compliment the carpaccio perfectly.  I am coming back again just because of this dish.  The calamari was good, but it is not your typical appetizer calamari.  It is calamari steak, cut in strips, lightly breaded and fried with a delicious white wine sauce and roasted tomatoes.  I was not in love just because I like the creepy, crispy tentacle part of squid.  Wow, did I just admit that?!  I guess what I mean is squid can be rubbery, so I personally am not a fan of the texture of the steak strips...But, if you don't like the creepy tentacles this is your kind of calamari because the sauce compliments it incredibly.    The service was outstanding; both of our bartenders did a great job.  I find the atmosphere of Tanzy quite romantic, but also lively too; would be great for a date!

I  frequent this joint often to relax outside on the patio and drink wine and/or beer.  The service here is outstanding.  My vegan friend particularly likes this place because they make her vegan friendly pizza.  As a carnivour I love their italian sausage.  And for all you cheese lovers their mozerella is made fresh daily!  I am more of a beer fan than a wine person so it is worth mentioning they have an extensive beer list, including quite a few beers on tap.  The sign above the patio says 'Patio and Wine Bar', so it can be easy to miss if you are looking for the full name on the sign.

I will admit it: sometimes I can be a bit of a jazz snob.  Unfortunately there are not many great places to see a decent live jazz show in this valley...But, I must say Eddie V's impressed me!    It all started off at Kierland Commons outdoor live music festival, then came the monsoon...What to do??  Still craving live music!  We asked around and Eddie V's was on the list.  We were all dressed in very casual summer clothes so it was a little awkward walking into such a nice restaurant looking like wet dogs, but the bartender made us feel right at home.  The band was on break and I have never been so happy I went on my 'Phoenix valley sucks for jazz' rant.  One of the band members was eves-dropping on our conversation LOL!  So, when the band started I was a little embarrassed...But, I think it amped them up a bit!  The band consisted of a drummer, pianist and an upright bassist.  After the set, my friend Jon thanked them and they chatted with us for a bit.  The pianist asked if it met my standard and said he had to keep it a bit more low key due to the fact it is fine dining, not a concert hall...which I recognize.  The bassist was a guest player from out of town (Austin) and you could tell they were having fun jamming.  The last set you could tell they took it up another notch, since the restaurant had cleared a bit.  It was so good 2 cute old couples started dancing and I think everybody was bopping to varying degrees in the room!    Our bartender was also fabulous.  She made all 3 of us some outstanding cocktails and she knew the menu well.  I opted for the calamari, which is unique with almost an Asian inspired twist...And it is HUGE!    Eddie V's started off as a last resort and ended up being a 3 hour adventure!  I will definitely be back here again.  They have jazz (not blues, Motown etc) every night!  You can't go wrong with great music, cocktails, service and atmosphere!

Coincidentally I came here on the 13th of August and they have awesome specials on the 13th (due to name 13 North)...I think the special was: buy any glass of wine and get one for 13 cents (or something similar to that). Anyway I had the large house salad with ahi tuna added on top; it was AWESOME! They do their tuna very well here! It is covered in tons of sesame seeds and lightly seared to perfection! I had the balsamic dressing with it and the salad was fabulous! I should also note they use GOOD Parmesan cheese that is shaved right from the block, YUMMY!   Our bartenders were very attentive (we sat at the bar). One of them could tell I was a hungry mungry, after I devoured half of the salad in about 5 minutes, so she brought me out a fresh basket of bread to have with my salad , so two thumbs up for service.   I have come here a few times since then and I would love to report on other menu items, but I just can't get passed the delicious sesame seed crusted ahi tuna salad! But, I can say all the other entrees I have seen look very tasty as well.

La Petite France is so quaint and cute!!  It is pretty tucked away in a nice outdoor shopping strip (curse AZ strip malls), which is kind of nice to be off the busy road.  The down side is I am not sure how much impromptu traffic they get, which is why I need to get the word out.  It would be horrible if this place went away.    I found this La Petite France on a mission for a new brunch spot, some of the central Scottsdale/Old Town Scottsdale places are too packed with poor service and food that is just okay and like anywhere else.  When I saw fresh crepes and chocolate croissants on the menu I had to come check it out.    Take the effort to find it (many other breakfast options)!  Park your car and basically walk to the middle of the shopping corridor and you will find La Petite France.    I sat down and was immediately poured a glass of water and they set a full bottle of water on the table for me.  I was informed of the daily specials, which all sounded quite delicious.  I ended up opting for the croissant plate with coffee.  MMMMMmmmmmm I was not disappointed; the croissants were so buttery and flaky!!  Get the chocolate croissant.  A friend of mine happened to be walking by on a weekend walk, so I invited her to join me.  It turns out my server was the owner and he told us all about new changes happening with the menu.  They have an actual French chef, meaning he is from France.  The staff is outstanding: very nice, professional, yet amazingly 'neighborhoody' for a Scottsdale restaurant.    Review #2:  Before I finished my review draft I came back to LPF!  That is a testament to how great this place is in my book.  The owner told me about the mussels when he was talking about the menu at my breakfast visit, so Friday instead of happy hour with my girl Kristen, we decided on wine and mussels.  La Petite France can do mussels 3 different ways...we opted for the traditional white wine, garlic, etc.  We wanted to lick the bowl clean!!! The bread is house made and fantastic!  The mussels were of course good, but it was the 'broth' around the mussels that we dipped the bread in that had us drooling.  I am going to have to come back and try the other two mussel dishes.    Also two tables near us had the Le Filet du Pechuer (serves 2 people), which is basically a soup with various kinds of fish, squid and shellfish that smelled AMAZING as it went by on the cart.  The one table told us we have to come back just for that dish, and said they come here regularly just for it.  Did I mention they have rack of lamb too...looks like I have quite a few trips back to La Petite France in my future!

I needed a pedicure and manicure before I went on vacation, so I figured I would try out this spot at Kierland Commons and get some shopping done as well. The place is pretty nice inside, but rather lacking in comfort, which is kind of important if you are going to sit still for an hour and a half for a mani and pedi.  The pedicure chair was alright (no massager though), but the manicure stool/bar was quite uncomfortable, ergonomically speaking.    My aesthetician's name was Jody and she was wonderful and a perfectionist!  She also hooked me up with a foot file.  When I checked out, I thought it was rather strange that the front desk person asked, "would you like to add a 20 percent tip?" Jody definitely deserved it, however I found the question impolite.  I mean, I would have been on the spot if I thought the service sucked and what if I would have added more?  Maybe,  "Would you like to add a tip?" is probably the more appropriate question, so the customer can decide the amount or pay cash.  She also did not give me a receipt so, I don't even know what she added to my total.   In summary, Jody my aesthetician was awesome.  The front desk service was less than desirable.  None of the seating was comfortable for a salon.  It was overpriced, but I expected that at Kierland.  I doubt I will be back, but if you are shopping at Kierland and need a service on the fly, this spot will get the job done well.

Squishy/soggy/slimy french toast, no substitutions without being charged, and initially seating us in the worst possible seat available (in-front of entryway/kitchen)= 2 stars.    Apparently it costs them $0.25 worth of brain power to use an alternate ingredient.  I am one of those annoying people that modifies menu items because I don't like some things that are standard to some dishes.  i.e.  avocado, sour cream, some cheeses, mayonnaise, and the list goes on...so I was not a very happy camper when I was told it was a $0.25 charge to substitute anything.  If I was still 8 years old, my breakfast would have cost me $30.  I can understand if I add something, but substitutions- that is stupid!  And according to my sister they need to change a few things with their French toast.

During the summer heat there is nothing like some ice cream to cool you down, especially the homemade stuff at Churn! Inside it is a very cute 50's style candy shop, so you can't help but feel like a kid in a candy store and want everything.  My friend lives right down the street and we walk there frequently, which I should note their biggest problem: PARKING!  They need to have some designated Churn parking spots!  There is also no indoor seating so you need to eat it outside, which can be a bit brutal in the Phoenix summer.  My other issue: how to decide which YUMMY flavors to eat!! Last time I had the double chocolate, mint cookie, and peanut butter (only one scoop, 1/3 each).  But their berry flavors are great too; I have had blueberry and strawberry and they were both amazing!   The flavors are always changing and I don't think you can go wrong with any of them!

I have had my windshield replaced twice this year at Ever-Ready Glass of Phoenix and I have never been disappointed!  I have a Jeep Wrangler that has a very upright and flat-faced windshield, which makes it extremely prone to cracking from flying debris. The first time it cracked Ever Ready even gave me a tinted visor for free (covered by insurance after you already have it)! :) Both times I needed a replacement I went into the repair shop, but I know they have mobile service that will do the work at your home or office for the customer's convenience.   I am not sure whether they are inexpensive or affordable because it was covered by my insurance, however they have great customer service and I consider them quite speedy! It only took them about 45 minutes total to replace my windshield and finish the paperwork. I will always come here for windshield repairs as long as I live in Phoenix!

I was not very excited about this place. The bartenders seemed to be very quick and the drinks were very good (well poured). The crowd was rather meh...I am not sure if it is because this place is new in Scottsdale but everybody was trying to be very cool in their own corners, not much intermingling going on. And yes it was full of Scottsdale's finest botoxed, boob-jobbed, mini-dressed cougars, as well as the 'cool' old men and of course the 50,000-dollar-millionaires strutting their stuff. And the dress code is no worse than your typical Scottsdale nightclub; their website extremely overstates their expectations from what I saw.  My biggest complaint was that the dance floor and I love to dance! What became the dance area was right in the middle of the main walking area towards the bathroom. The DJ booth is cool but, there isn't exactly an established dance floor so it is right in the middle between some tables and in the walkway; poor planning if you ask me. The decor is alright; it was supposedly a bank before (hence the name The Mint)...It is almost over decorated if there is such a thing. But, I did really like some of the unique art on the walls! We came here early in the evening on a Saturday with a group of gals, so the line was not too bad, but when we left the place was a madhouse outside and there was no apparent exit route.  I doubt I will be back here; this is not exactly my scene. Maybe after the hype of this place simmers a bit, it may be more fun.

I am a little disappointed in myself for not walking into this restaurant sooner considering it is less than a mile from where I live!  The service I had was outstanding!  Unfortunately, I did not catch my server's name.    Iron Chef has the best happy hour ever!  All rolls are 50% off and many other items are 40% off, and they have great drink specials.  There is also a reverse happy hour from 8-10.  I honestly need to come back because I wanted to try 20 things on the menu...they have quite an extensive menu.    I ended up ordering the squid salad, the ahi tuna martini and spring rolls and a mai tai.  I know I am a piglet, but I did indeed eat it all!  The squid salad was good, not the best I have ever had, but still very delicious.  I cleaned the dish!  The ahi tuna martini was fabulous!  There was tons of fresh, cold tuna and it tasted spectacular with the seaweed, cucumber and the sauce brought it all together.  As you can tell from the picture, it had quite the presentation as well.  Everything at Iron Chef seems to have a lovely presentation in general, I was enjoying watching all the dishes come from the kitchen/sushi bar.  You can tell the spring rolls are made in house; nothing too excting to say about spring rolls but they are $2!    Again my server was a doll, I will be sure to catch her name next time!  Everything is very reasonably priced and I hope my fortune cookie is right!

So my silly, adorable, dog is not a fan of being groomed, washed, pampered, really anything except fed by strangers...So, I take him here every few weeks to personally give the grumpy old fellow a bath (see picture).  It is like a do-it-yourself doggy car wash.  You pay $10 for the first 15minutes and it comes with 4 different choices of soaps (sensitive skin. anti-flea, deep clean, shiny coat and whitening) and a conditioning treatment if you prefer.  They have a blow dryer, but Brando is more of a towel off and shake to cover everyone else in water kind of dog.  I have never gone over the 15minutes (and Brando probably wouldn't tolerate it anyway), but if you do it is a $1 for an additional 3minutes.    Aside from that they have a large assortment of natural foods, toys and other fun pet stuff!  But, I really love Pet Planet because it keeps my bathroom from smelling like wet dirty dog, and getting coated in a layer of dog hair.  Thank you Pet Planet!

I swim here at least 3 times a week and it is a great facility! This is a public pool, but it is very clean and professional (stereotypically public pools tend to have a bad rep). They have a lap pool that is separate from the public swim (play pool), so you can swim laps at ease with few interruptions. The pool is however deep, so I would not recommend it for people looking for a walking/water aerobics pool (unless you can do it treading at the same time). The daily fee is either 2 or 3 dollars depending on whether you are a Scottsdale resident or not (that is the lap swim rate- not sure about the public swim rate). Also, you can buy a card with 30 sessions on it and sometimes it is discounted by the city. I know there are also family passes available, but I don't have a family and am not knowledgeable about restrictions, prices etc.   I recommend swimming laps in the morning before the public session starts at 1pm or after 5pm, when it ends, because the locker rooms can be packed with kids running around and large groups (i.e boys and girls club etc.).   There is also a fitness center, but I have never used it.

I think this place is at 3.5 stars for the moment, but I will round up based on my drink and bartender alone!  The 5 STAR moment: I had a VERY VERY good Tom Collins, made by a handsome bartender.  My friend and I decided to move to a table since we decided to order food, and the bartender continued to serve us, even though he had to continually walk around the bar.  It was nice and professional of him not to switch us over/close us out. The management was also very polite to come over to inquire about our experience at Casablanca.    The unfortunate part in our experience was our food was VERY late.  I know the food comes from the Herb Box, which is tasty and the restaurant was very busy (Saturday night), but the food was less than desirable how and when it was served.  The staff apologized and they did discount the food, so they did try and make it right. My biggest issue with the whole food experience is this has happened to me before with a large group here.    As far as the ambiance goes, this place is 'loungey' as the name says, with dark corners, dim lighting and cozy seating.  There is usually a band or a DJ playing enjoyable/soothing tunes.  It was dead when we arrived, but it picked up around 9...I am not complaining though because we were therefor able to have an outstanding bar experience.   Main point:  Go to Casablanca for drinks and the lounge...not the food.

My last trip here was very disappointing.  Where to begin?   It took a while for our server to show up.  Interesting side note: While waiting for our server we couldn't help but notice out of the 24 patrons in the restaurant 23 were female LOL!  The happy hour menu was okay but nothing too spectacular, select wines $5 or $7 dollars, select cocktails were I think $5, and some discounted apps, bruschetta $3.    We ordered two cocktails and a bruschetta.  They didn't have the cucumber for the drink I selected so I had them modify it with raspberries...didn't have that either.  Anyway I ended up with an interesting gin drink, which worked because I was very thirsty at that point.  The bruschetta that was supposed to come out of the brick oven looked good BUT was cold.  I mean it was cooked in a brick oven , somebody probably changed their mind or whatever; it was then put it in a fridge to preserve it and failed to heat it up again, which was then served to us cold.  At that point we decided not to have dinner here and left to go somewhere else.    I am very disappointed, I loved this place when it opened!

I bring my grumbly dog in here for a wash every few weeks.  It costs $10 +tax.  The staff is always wonderful!  If you give your dog a bath on Friday you get a free bag of treats for your dog (like a whole bag not a sample bag).  Also they have a private wash room so your dog is not distracted by other dogs, humans etc.  Brando, as you can tell from the photo, is not a fan of baths, so he is better off in a private wash room with his master until he is clean and frolicking.  To top it off the 10th wash is free!  The store has a great selection of toys, treats, food and other fun animal stuff.  I am a big fan of their scented dog poo bags, so it makes my job less smelly and slightly more enjoyable.  Yay Pet Planet!

If you are a first time waxing victim you should come here!  Leslee has been doing this for a while and will make sure your experience is as 'enjoyable' as possible.  She uses great wax, aseptic technique and makes sure you walk out of there silky smooth.  I have not had her facials, but she was telling me about them during my last waxing procedure and I think she won me over!  I will give an update once I can truly talk about my facial experience!  Also, I should note her boutique salon is in the basement of Sachi Salon, so be sure to ask the front desk how to get down there and do not wait in the waiting area of Sachi.    I highly recommend Berry Berry Beauty; Leslee has a cool, calm personality that keeps you at ease even through a rather uncomfortable, intimate waxing experience.

This place is somewhere between 3 and 4 stars, but I like to give the benefit of the doubt.  The first time I came here was for takeout.  I ordered at the bar and had a beverage in the interim while I waited for my pizza.  The bar patrons were very nice and knowledgeable about the menu; one gentleman even let me try his food when it came from the kitchen (seafood lasagna- yum)!  They gave me some great tips on food to try from the menu in the future.  My company and I thought the pizza was very good and perfectly cooked.  It was not the best pizza ever, but it hit the spot!  On a second occasion, I came here on a date.  I found the lights to be rather bright in the dining room (bar much better), but I am all about dim lighting anyway, so maybe I am biased.  Also, our server was too attentive.  I hate to say that because he was very nice and charming, but the interruptions were kind of annoying (my date actually mentioned it to me too).  Another thing not helping the ambiance was a table of drunk golfers that needed hearing aides, making our intimate conversation rather challenging (not that it was the restaurant's fault).    More importantly, I guess you mainly go to a restaurant for food and Vito's did not disappoint.  I cannot remember what my date had, but I know the plate was empty at the end, and it looked and smelled good upon arrival.  I had the veal Marsala (don't hate me- yes I ate a baby cow), and it was amazing...The sauce was great, the pasta perfectly al dente, and the meat was tender as expected.  I did not think I could finish it all because the portion was HUGE, but I did :)

This place is a cute little boutique store with pleasant owners!  They have clothes, jewelry and some nice spa gifts.  I bought one of their soaps because it matched my bathroom and was so cute and smelled awesome!  They have a good variety of clothing, some more traditional, some southwestern flare, others more hip, but all with a general artsy quality.  I LOVE their collection of Sunglasses, but I have like 50 pairs so I refrained from buying.  The prices are a bit steep, but the quality is outstanding and you can tell they use local/regional artists, which is always a plus in my book!

This place is STUPID and the epitome of 'Snotsdale'.  You could get better customer service from a 10 cent hooker.  If your idea of fun is standing in a back alley next to a dumpster and being treated rudely by a douche bag bouncer who looks like he is from Oklahoma, then definitely come check out Citizen R+D.    Also, the only reason we came to Citizen R+D is we met the bartender at Citizen Public house the evening before and he talked it up as an amazing experience to my girlfriend, visiting from Chicago on a business trip ...Well, it wasn't.   We called in at 9:02pm with a party of 3.  There was a group waiting in front of us so we knew we would have to wait a bit.  The man on the phone said it would be about 15minutes.  So, we stood in the alley next to the dumpster and chitchatted about girlie stuff.  20minutes later, 2 fine gentleman walked down the stairs and we thanked them for leaving, so we could have a table.  They responded, "If we had known you were out here we would have invited you to our table"...darn.  We continued to wait and 2 more large parties left....hmmm, why are we still in this alley? So, at 9:36 I called again.  I said we are the party of 3 and wondering if there was a table, he said they are cleaning the tables.  I asked if we should go to Citizen Public house for a drink instead if they needed time, since it was cold that night.  He responded, "I don't care what you do."  WHAT!?  SNAP, Lisa got bitchy! "The only reason I am standing in this stupid alley is because the bartender told us to come tonight because he thought my friend from Chicago would enjoy the crafty cocktails."  All of a sudden there is another voice on the phone.  It was the bartender.  He said it would be five minutes while they clear the tables.  I said okay and hung up.  My friend was pissed, and she is impatient anyway, and wanted to go immediately... we waited till 9:47 and nobody came to let us in.  3 other groups had come up behind us and my friend told them they should go somewhere else.  We told them to go to Mable's on Main where you can go have an amazing cocktail in 'speak-easy-ish atmosphere' with great service and no wait for half the price.    In the end, I was embarassed I even took my friend there, she was supremely annoyed.  We stood outside in an alley for 45 minutes, in the cold, and ended up talking 10 people into going to another bar.  We found great drinks, for half the price, and better service at another joint.    The reasons it gets 2 stars and not 1 is the bartender who we met the night before at Citizen Public house is a good bartender and I have been here before on my birthday and we had a good time, but the drinks are expensive and they add an automatic 20% gratuity which is also stupid.    I don't foresee this place lasting long because the customer service is really horrible, and you really only need to experience a 'unique' place like this once.  Not to mention the prices are ridiculous for a cocktail that you have to wait 20minutes for it's assembly.  Now that I think about it, you really do just spend a lot of time waiting.  Also, you owner idiots, if you are going to make people wait outside while you have open tables, you should probably have a different exit than your entrance.  I had such a bad experience I think I have boycotted Citizen Public House as well... what a shame.

I love this place or I should say I love their ceviche!  If you like ceviche, you MUST try the Hot and Raw Tropical Ceviche; it is amazing!  Also, be conservative when adding in the fresh diced habanero pepper that comes on top....it will sneak up on you as you get to the bottom of the bowl.   If you are not into spice Sol has, I think, four kinds of ceviche and I highly recommend 3 of them (not a fan of the shrimp one).  Another brownie point for Sol is their complimentary, yummy, unique 'chips and salsa'.  Many Mexican places have moved more towards making you pay for the chips and salsa, so I appreciate them keeping with my all-time favorite Mexican restaurant tradition :)  I have had a few of their entrees as well and the food is superbly made and beautifully presented.  They definitely add a little extra 'Sol flare' to all their food, which usually isn't a bad thing, but you should not be expecting 'traditional' Mexican food while dining at Sol.  My servers and bartenders have always been knowledgeable about the food and pleasant- the other reason I keep coming back apart from the ceviche!  In terms of ambiance this is definitely chic for a Mexican Restaurant- no tacky bright decor and neon lights here!  The patio is also very inviting with misters during the hot summers and it is attached to one side of the bar, making it rather lively if it is hopping.    My one complaint about Sol is the prices are a bit steep for Mexican food (around $13 for 3 tacos, entrees $15-$30 & house margarita $8+), but I guess they do have to pay rent at the Scottsdale Quarter so I will cut them slack on that.  I should also mention they have a decent happy hour from 3-6 everyday, so if you are on a tighter budget you should go then.  Unfortunately my favorite, the Hot and Raw Ceviche, is not on the Happy Hour menu.

I was here for liquid indulgences and Crudo did not disappoint!!! Also little did I know my bartender was the owner!  He made me an absolutely lovely Clover Club with hearts in the 'froth', so beautiful!  It was almost so pretty I didn't want to drink it, but alas I was thirsty ;) I have not eaten at Crudo for the record...I did see some amazing looking food pass by though!  I will be back for more amazing cocktails, service and I definitely need to try the food...If it is anything like Crudo beverages I am sure it will be spectacular!!

This doctor's office truly cares about patient care.  After a long night of hot and cold, then  waking up with my throat swollen shut and huge lymph nodes, I attempted to call my former ENT to see if they could get me in for an 'urgent appointment'.  I figured since they know all my ENT/medical history it was better to go to them than some minute clinic, also I was pretty extremely ill so an ENT was probably most appropriately suited for the job.  My old doc's office told me, after waiting on the phone for 20minutes, that i couldn't get in for 4 days.  I almost went to urgent care, but the thought of waiting forever in a waiting room made me nauseous.  Instead I called the closest ENT that seemed to have good reviews on-line, and that is how I came to know the wonderful people at Dr. Kurt Heiland's practice.  They squeezed me into the schedule that afternoon, and were truly sympathetic to my ailments on the phone.  Dr. Heiland and his staff were very professional and nice, even with a very busy day at the practice.  He was also very clear and directly spoken, and made sure all my questions and concerns were answered.  I survived my illness of course, but I truly appreciate everything they did for me when I felt like I was on my death bed!!

First of all this is not your typical Fili B's!  It is like the Cadillac of late night fast food restaurants!  It has a sit down restaurant, a full laminated menu, a full bar, BIG screen TVs and wait staff!!  Wow!  Now I know this is not 5 star dining, but in the realm of late night/fast food this is a whole other level of greatness which is why I had to give five stars.    The owner happened to be our server and he was extremely friendly and excited about his restaurant and rightfully so!  All the screens had soccer on while I was there, which in my opinion added to the 'ambiance'.  The bar and restaurant were hopping with excited soccer fans!    We ordered the half-order of loaded nachos as an appetizer.  I had the ceviche tostada and carne asada taco for dinner.  My friend had an amazing burrito!  See all the pictures; it all looked and tasted delicious.  The nachos weren't that exciting, but aside from that everything else was done very well and came out fast!  The ceviche came with a huge portions of fish and cabbage and tasted great, which I never in my wildest dreams would have envisioned at a Fili B's!   I had a frozen margarita that they made in house, blended just for me...no margarita machine here.  So yes there was plenty of tequila.  Thank goodness for my good DD friend Nydi!    I don't think I can ever go to a normal Filiberto's again!  Well, ask me at 2am and I may change my tone Hahhah!

Italian Nachos!!! How come this is not on the menu at more places?  Brilliant I tell you!  Fresh pita covered in marinara, mozzarella, pepperoni, Italian sausage and olives!  I definitely recommend the HALF order, it is very filling.  All the food seemed decent on the menu; mostly typical bar food, but with a little flare.  Ask the helpful bartender for suggestions.  Aside from the bartender's knowledge of the menu, he also kept the drinks loaded.    We rolled in on a Wednesday after a baseball game and they had a blues band...what started off as a simple drink after a game, turned into an evening out with a fun band.  Oh, did I mention they coerced me into going up and singing with them...And for the record, Lisa E. cannot sing well.  Amazingly I didn't clear the bar.    Legends, in general, is just a really good bar:  Great patio, pleasant atmosphere (brick interior with an inset bar), live music, good food, and charming helpful staff.  Not sure what more you could ask for!  When I am in the downtown area I will be sure to come back!

I can't believe this place doesn't have reviews yet!?  I have been in quite a few times; they are speedy and very friendly.  My most recent trip I just needed a strip of tape to seal the deal, literally to seal the envelope!  I was in-and-out the door in less than 2 minutes (pre-paid UPS postage)!  I always come here for my shipping needs since it is right around the corner with great service, and lots of shipping and packaging options.

Fly Like an Eagle...Come Fly with Me, Come Fly with me...I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings.  Coming down is the hardest thing...  It was really as close to flying like a bird as you can get, and I have to say it was quite serene and relaxing..almost tranquil.  You know when you see a dog hanging his head out the window of a moving vehicle, with his ears flapping in the wind and it looks as if it is at complete bliss...yeah that was me.    In a nut shell this is how it all goes:  You sign away your life.  You get to gear up in a cool helmet and slide into your 'flying cocoon'.  Then a unique one-man plane tows you into the air (this part is a bit noisy).  Once you are REALLY HIGH in the sky you release and the plane flies away and lands.  That initial release is so cool, you feel like you are floating in the skies.  Then the flying starts...seriously soaring for about 15-20min.  There is little noise except the ruffle of the wind on your glider.  The instructor shows you how to be a copilot, which was cool to learn how to steer.  Did you know you can go "Look ma, No hands" on a hang-glider?  Oh yes you can, and we did.    Adventurous Lisa E.  was like, 'hey I will let you steer and flip us around all crazy instead of letting this armature fiddle around like a bird on the short bus.'  That is when the acrobatics began.  Oh yeah I was gliding, diving, twirling, free-falling, recovering and spinning all over the sky with desert down below and the mountains in the distance.  AAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaamazeballs!   For the record if you are scared of such things, you don't have to do that part.  Then came the landing, the part I was most concerned about.  It was a breeze!  Honestly smoother than landing in a commercial airplane.  The instructor definitely knows his stuff and has been hang-gliding for a long time or maybe he is just a smooth criminal.  :) No really in all seriousness, the team at Sonora Wings knows their stuff and you are in good hands.    If you have ever wanted to fly like a bird, soar like an eagle then you need to try hang-gliding!  This is also a great gift for the adventurous type!  I received my 'hang-gliding lesson' for my birthday from my dear friend Nydia and I have to say it is something I will never forget!

For the record this place's menu is obviously heavily weighted on pork, hence the name Salty Sow.  Not being a huge pork fan, I have had the brussels sprouts and the chocolate truffle cake.  I haven't had any desire to eat anything else because they are SO good!  I don't even like Brussels sprouts!    The cocktails are pretty descent here too...along with the chocolate truffle cake!! Maybe someday I will get myself to order something else; I am sure many other items on the menu are just as delicious!

Family owned Italian in the Esplanade/Biltmore area??  Figured it would be some chain or over-hyped, fancy, shmany place that had 'alright' Italian food, boy was I wrong!  My friend Eric brought me to this spot and I arrived a bit early, which gave me plenty of time to explore the menu.  When I saw chitarra pasta on the menu I knew they must make their own noodles in house, which lead to quite a quandary as to what to eat.  So, I waited and drank wine to help figure things out.  Eric arrived and we decided we needed assistance to narrow down all the choices on the menu.  The server and bartender were very helpful in getting us in the right direction and we ordered the Meat and Cheese Board with 3 types of cheese and their Copa...yum!  It came with dried fruits and various jams and a few crostinis.  Quite a large board for the price with great ingredients.  This was perfect for me because I wanted to save room for dessert.    We split the main entree (Bolognese)...holy amazing sauce!!! This dish was DELICIOUS!! Again I should note you can tell the noodles are made in house, YUMyum!  We got an order of meatballs on the side to go with it, which you really don't need because the Bolognese is quite large.  The meat balls are spectacular with perfect texture and density and the perfect size to eat them for a meal at lunch; it also comes with their amazing house marinara sauce.    Last but not least was the dessert.  The original plan was to get one dessert and then for checking-in I received a free dessert!!  So, why not get TWO??  :) We ordered the special for that evening:  A crepe with lemon filling and a milk chocolate drizzle over the top!!! I love lemon and chocolate, not a fan of crepes...but I am now! We also ordered the chocolate lava cake.  Again perfect!  The dessert was surprisingly light but decadent.  Great flavors and texture, but not overly rich!  I think the pictures speak for themselves; I had to take a picture of the desserts because they looked so delectable.    The question is not will I come back, it is how soon can I get back to Solo Trattoria?!  The servers educated us very well on the menu; there are so many things I still want to try: carpaccio, pizza, mussels, and all the veal dishes.  Also I should say they change the menu seasonally and the prices are very reasonable; I was expecting much higher considering the area.  This restaurant also supports local growers and has gluten free options.  Solo is officially my new favorite Italian restaurant in the valley!

I was excited to come check out Whiskey Row...And unfortunately I am not impressed.  It was rather douchey, not very country and just lacked any kind of appealing ambiance.  The bright yellow lights on the wall spelling "TIP IT ON BACK" were rather glaringly annoying.  The bartenders were not very pleasant, charming or energized.  I had one beer with my friend as we watched two 'interesting' bachelorette parties, some drunk golfers, and some other random gals wearing tutus...like I said not exactly country.  After that we decided it was time to move on to the next watering hole...not sure this spot is for me.

I had a HORRIBLE day and nothing was going right.  I was supposed to meet up with friends here, but my car battery died along with another whole string of events that I will spare you...the dear waiter had heard of all the atrocities that had happened to me and offered to pick me up on his break and guaranteed I would have a better day.  I toted my butt in a cab over and everyone was way ahead but having a blast.  Matt our waiter was fantastic, but unfortunately as I arrived it was time for him to clock out.  He was very charming and funny though; you are lucky if you have him as a server.    Matt was replaced by Macy who was also a doll and kept the draft beer flowing.  She hooked me up with two flavors of wings on my small order and gave me a huge bowl of celery to lap up the yummy sauces.    Unfortunately my 49ers lost, and they had huge big screens to remind me of that!  Haha!  All and all this is a good sports bar, lots of TVs, big bar, great specials, and outstanding service.  My wings were just okay and seemed a bit pricey to me, but the beer was cheap to make up for it.  I will definitely be back for beer and sports because the service was impeccable and it is close to home!

This place is like the chipotle of pizza joints.  Select your crust, your toppings, and sauce, then they fire it up in an 800 degree Fahrenheit oven in TWO minutes!!  The prices are very reasonable at around $9 a pizza and you can get as many toppings as you would like!  The pizza comes out perfectly crispy!  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and gave me outstanding recommendations.  I highly recommend the whole wheat crust.   The garlic knots are pretty good too.  Also they have a club where you get items for free after so many purchases and access to promotions that they send out.  Just for signing up I got a free cup of ice cream!    If you need some pizza on the fly, this is a way better option than most pizza delivery chains in my book!!

My dear friend Marisa S. introduced me to the Wine Warehouse for an Oregon wine tasting event!  This is an adorable boutique wine house with a tasting table and lots of wine to choose from.  The staff I met was extremely nice; I had the pleasure of meeting Sharon and Patrick.  We chatted about wine, pets, children, silly Canadians sitting on the adorable patio and everything in-between.  We tasted some good complimentary wines from a distributor representing their Oregon wines and I also had a flight of white wines from the tasting bar.  Happy hour has $2 off per glass and $5 off a flight.  Also they have complimentary tasting events every Tuesday and Friday with light bites to nibble at (cheeses, crackers, nuts, veggies etc).  I had a great time here and will be back if I am feeling thirsty for some vino...which is quite often ;)

P-ay-stee, P-ah-stee, or P-aaaa-stee, however you say pasty- it is good stuff.  When I went here with a large group of work friends, we found many interesting ways to say "pasty" and after the beers started  flowing even more ha!  If you are very hungry this is the place to go!  A pasty is similar to a calzone or an empanada but with a thin-ish pastry dough as opposed to a bread/pizza dough around the outside.  You can fill it up with any kind of yumminess you would like and the menu is full of delicious options.    The drink menu is decent with a good selection of beers and I am a fan of their house cocktails considering 3 out of 4 of them have gin :)  The service can be slow, but they are generally nice and informative.  The patio is great for groups with bench style seating and picnic tables.  Two historic homes make up the building and  inside there is a view of the kitchen and the staff usually waves hi, which is very pleasant and inviting!

Ingo's is a neat little spot, with an interesting concept.  I agree with Lindsey H. who called it a 'gourmet concession stand'.  The inside only seats about 12 people, but there is lots of outdoor seating!  The menu is also quite basic and small, but you can tell the main focus is on the ingredients.  You can get any burger Adam and Eve style (naked- with lettuce), on a LGO English muffin, or on one of there homemade hamburger buns.  I went with great company, Jon and Amy, so we each got a burger in a different style, of course Jon went naked :P   Amy had the burger with sauerkraut (Ingo Burger), I think we all agree that was the best burger and quite unique with great flavors.  Amy said, "This is the best burger I have had in a long time!"  Jon and I were a bit jealous.  We both opted for their version of a bacon cheddar burger (Paris-Texas Burger), which had Tillamook sharp cheddar cheese (for the record I LOVE this cheese), a homemade sweet barbecue sauce, and crispy pancetta.  It was quite good, but I have had better bacon-burgers in my day.  I also found the barbecue sauce to be a bit sweet for my liking.  Jon and I still devoured every last morsel, so I am not really complaining as it was good food.    The menu was lacking side dish options and salads.  We had the spiced up potato chips that are made in house and comes with their version of a sour cream dip.  It was good comfort food, but very fried.  The only salad on the menu is a quinoa and kale salad, so if you don't like that 'stuff' you are SOL.  This is not a bar, but it is also worth noting the beer and wine options are limited...but they are only $3 during happy hour, which we managed to make by 7min (ends at 6pm).    Last but not least, our amazing server told us about their ice cream sandwich dessert with Belgium chocolate and peanut-butter!!!  If I wasn't stuffed and heading to the gym right after eating I would have been all over that!! I will be back to try that for sure, but I would come back in general anyway :)

Adrien our server was fantastic:  good sense of humor, good timing (AKA not annoying), and kept the water glasses filled.  Now that I think about it, the host was very pleasant and accommodating as well considering how busy the restaurant was on a Tuesday evening.    I was actually here with two fellow Yelpers and we had a wonderful evening wining and dining!  We started off with the meat and cheese board known as the Dad's Grocery bag.  I have to say I was a bit underwhelmed, but the sopressata was delicious!    One person had the Shrimp Po'boy and she cleared the plate.  Not my kind of sandwich but she seemed very satisfied.  Another person ordered the Swordfish special and WOW!  It looked delectable! It was a large fish steak that was very tender to the 'forking'...is that even a word?  Anyway it was probably the highlight! It came with a side of cauliflower that was perfectly roasted:  tender with the right amount of crunch.    I had the ahi tuna poki with no avocado (see photo).  It was very refreshing and light on a scorching day with fresh ahi tuna, shrimp and green onion, accompanied by wonton chips to scoop it up.  It was perfect with my glass of wine.  I think I wish I had gone with the Grassroots Gimlet my friend had, but they may have gone down too fast and easy :)    I will be back to try more things on the menu and see our fabulous server Adrien!

I should have done better 'due diligence' on the front end and maybe never have walked in here to begin with.  It is hard to be a pizza joint in this part of town considering all the outstanding competition in the neighborhood too.  Everything looked pre-made and not fresh.  All the pizzas were preheated with toppings on them ready to go, before you even get there, then they fire it in an oven when a pizza is ordered.    Since the pizzas didn't look particularly appetizing, I had asked about substituting capicola (which was on another sub on the menu) for the ham on the Italian sub and the server said they were already pre-prepared.  I opted for the barbeque chicken pizza the gentleman at the counter suggested.  The crust was not good; it was kind of like Boboli bread.  The servers were nice, but unfortunately I can not say the same for the food.
