Not impressed... For around $40 a month you get a gym that is filled with old equipment, has a super cluttered feel and warm inside!   The trainers did seem to be knowledgable and were giving good workouts but the facility is lacking for the price.  If you're looking for a good trainer you could probably find one here but if you want a gym to get your own workouts in I wouldn't recommend it.

Super healthy food... Everything on the menu is great!  If you find yourself around any pita jungle I would recommend it!

I've always had fun at the vig!! I love their Sunday wine deals and would definitely recommend for a relaxed happy hour spot... Nice atmosphere!

Has everything you need in a gym... Everything is kept up nice and the equipment is new!  You have room to do any exercise and not feel like you'll bump into someone... If you don't want to go to a big box gym then try this one

The food here is great and I love the concept but the bartenders are HORRIBLE!! They are rude and don't know how to make drinks... When I asked for a manager I was basically ignored until I pushed to speak to one... Wouldn't recommend for a night out
