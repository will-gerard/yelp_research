O me O my, what was I to expect.  I'm still wondering about the title of the show... perhaps it was derived from the OOOOhhhhhs and Ahhhhhsss.... well, perhaps  You had things going on everywhere, so if you pay attention to one spot, you may have missed some stuff on stage.  I truly enjoyed this show as it is so artsy and well performed.  The music added the mystique.  I recommend this show to anyone.  Just bare in mind though that if you expect a lot of dialogue or want that, this may not be your cup of tea.  Brilliant show!  Beautifully performed.  Don't forget to grab a frozen daiquiri before you get to your seats!

As much as I don't want to give such a low rating, I believe that I had too high of an expectation going here.  First off, being a vegetarian, you have to do some research to know the best places to go where you can have a decent meal.  This buffet happens to show up on the radar when you type in "vegetarian + buffet" in a search engine.  Everyone raves about the amount of items available to us vegetarians/vegans.  Unfortunately either I came on an off night or they have completely changed their stance on providing a good amount of items for vegans/vegetarians.  I had pushed my group to go here based on it being vegetarian friendly.  Sure there were a pretty good amount for us to eat, it was not the amount I expected.  I believe when I went, there were only one option or none at each station sans seafood/meat section for obvious reasons.  I had expected the Chinese station to provide some vegetarian dishes, but everything there contained meat.  I guess the spring roll is something since it was the only vegetarian item at that station.  I decided to ask the chef there if they can do a vegetarian dish or had a secret menu for us knowing the reputation of this being a supposed veggie buffet haven.  He just shrugged and gave me this weird look, kept staring, and then said no.  He then decided to asked if I wanted pork wonton soup while in our awkward and apparent standoff.  I think I gave him a rare WTF look by my standards and walked off.  He was not smiling or seem to care, so why should I.  Sad really.  The thing I filled up on was vegetarian ramen which was okay, some pasta, grilled peppers (saving grace for the meal), and some desserts.  All in all this buffet was a disappointment.  Again, maybe it was their off night considering all the rave reviews.  The chance of them providing us with a retribution is slim since our chances of returning here by choice is slim especially with the price being about 50 dollars each.  Everyone including my meat eating friends thought this was a BLAHfet.

Thank you Wynn for treating me like a celebrity (although I am secretly am haha).  I returned here and had an awesome experience thanks to management (will withhold name just for privacy).  We got sat in probably the best seat in the house which is with the garden view in the middle.  As a vegetarian, it is nice to see them have some more options during brunch surprisingly enough.  I do say this as an egg eater though, so if you are vegan, I suggest you ask them to show you what is available before you decide to purchase the buffet (if possible).  I was told dinner is probably best for vegetarians/vegan.  I happened to decide brunch was the best time for us to go.  Great service and well prepared food.  The second visit tops the first one for sure.  I was not planning to return, but they wanted me to give it another chance, and I thank you for it.  Thank you Wynn!  I will be coming to try dinner again!  Sorry this update took so long.  I have been planning to write it since I got back.

I was blown away by the show as I anticipated less.  The costumes were well done, and the people in the show had the look for Medieval Times.  The crowd was really into it!  I was on the edge of my seat when they fought each other as they really swung their weapons at full force.  You could see sparks coming from them.  Great experience!  I suggest you see it for yourself.  I would consider it more of a kids show, but there were some "dark" parts also that I did not expect.  A lot of fun though that's for sure!  The food is not too bad.  It was a bit plain, but like an earlier reviewer stated, the tomato soup kicked butt!  I ate me a vegetarian meal also, and I have to say that the potato wedge was the best part.  The tomato soup became my sauce for everything lol.  I was also scared that dirt would be kicked into my food, so we all moved our food closer to us.  This show is a good deal considering you get food and a show!

The show gets 3 stars - Everything was entertaining, especially the lady whom is the main host of the show.  She is quick witted and funny and makes the show fun just with her one liners.  Me and my friends sat next to the performers in the show.  We didn't even know they were performers until the show starting kicking in.  You just have to see it for yourself.  The food and service gets another star as they were really attentive and always had a smile.  I loved the food.  I'm a vegetarian and was eating something the meat eaters were salivating over as I heard comments all around saying how "That looks delicious!"  The funny thing is when I asked what was for vegetarians, the server just stated whatever they come up with.  Me and another friend whom is vegetarian got a wild rich and mushroom dish with some string beans, two kinds of potatoes (the mash potatoes were some of the best I've ever had), and a tomato thingy... not sure what it's called.  I inhaled the food lol.  I say that if you're ever in Vegas' downtown to check this show out.  It's unique and entertaining.

Phoenix is lucky to have this place!  Vegans rejoice as the food was amazing.  I had to go there twice on my visit.  For starters, the staff is very friendly and were happy to be there.  The drinks: Great selection with some organic choices like lime/lemonade.  I mixed it all up which tasted great.  I will say that trying each individually was nice too.  I love that they have green tea as one of the options.  I did not get anything from the fridge as they had sodas and other things there.  Nice.  The food: Fries were awesome considering they were thin cut which made them crispy throughout.  Not sure if they had another options, but we got the thyme fries.  I recommend it.  Sandwiches were bomb! Big Wac - Well, if you like the Big Mac when and if you ever ate meat, this is it without the guilt or blood.  Tasted awesome and I am surprised that this was vegan since the cheese was so cheesy.  Barbeque Chicken - A big sloppy in which you may need a knife and fork to eat.  Me and my friend split it, so we just cut it in half and it oozed with sauce.  Great sauce and great sandwich.  The extra sauce is a nice dipping item for the fries for sure.  Faux Lay Of Fish - Awesome!  Since I had a fish sandwich before while I was eating the last bite, I had to make sure it was not real fish.  My friend reassured me as she is a fish eater.  I on the other hand was surprised.  We had to get it again on our second visit.  The only thing is for those going there to try this, it is a seasonal item or special.  I hope they have it when you go!  Diablo Bowl - Not bad and had great seasoning.  We had a mix of both noodles and brown rice (friends wanted that as I only wanted noodles).  That probably didn't help the dish, but in the long run, the dish had a nice flavor.  Would try again if I am ever in the area after getting one of the above beforehand though.  We also went next door to try a cake.  Although their other stuff was pretty good based on some sampling, that cake was way too sweet.  It was my mini birthday cake though, so THANK YOU for putting that candle on it!  :)  Made me extra happy.
