Got their current promo item claiming to be a Island fire cheeseburger. The burger boasts spicy habanero sauce which actually fell very short of anything spicy. The redeeming factor is always their drinks but it's hard to get that wrong.

Great local spot for some happy hour and food to keep you functioning enough to keep throwing back brews. They have this awesome drink called the dogma which isn't for the faint of heart that sets the tone every time I stop by that I always introduce to newcomers. The bar staff is always friendly and quick and the chips and salsa always on point.

I've been going to Dr. Patel for over 10 years now and he has always been a great doctor. I can always count on getting in right away and have the confidence Dr. Patel and his staff will take care of me. I recently recommended one of my good friends when she was looking for a new doctor and she loves him too!

I got dragged here by my best friend who happens to be a teacher so I wasn't super thrilled but anything for the bestie. I don't frequent craft stores all the time but everything that my friend was looking for was really easily found. I can only say thing because while she couldn't find anything she was looking for I was easily able to navigate using their signs to find the desired items. The staff was always friendly as we looked around seemingly forever for knick knacks for her class all the way to check out.

My favorite pho spot in Arizona. Always full of flavor and always on point. I always grab a rau ma or iced coffee when I'm here too but it's probably cause they're the best when you're hungover. Definitely also recommend saving some room for an ice cream macaroon preferably the taro cookie and Pandan ice cream flavors.

Friendly service as always from Desert Schools but the location was very chaotic as far as parking and maneuvering in. Would have gone to another location if not convenient at the time.

The Chandler staple for donuts. Always fresh and always open its hard not to stop by when you're driving by. I noticed they're starting to make more of a variety of donuts so that's awesome. I don't know what else to say but if you love donuts you'll love this place.

If you want to immerse yourself in the mill scene this is a good start. Always packed and good deals on their long islands and their long list of variants this is the greatest place to start off before venturing elsewhere down mill ave in my opinion. I've only played a game of pool once here so I can't really describe that ordeal other than needing patience for a spot to shoot but everyone seemed aware of their surrounding so it wasn't awful.

I've been going here for a few years now and the staff is always friendly and helpful when I drop by. Dr. Pham always answers all of my questions and explains to me everything that's going on so I literally see everything going on. They also helped me out when my glasses had a problem and warrantied them out so I could get a new frame. The location is easily accessible too in Chandler and if you have time to kill before your appointment there's plenty around their office. I would highly recommend their services to any of my friends and family.

Was recommended here by an old friend and coworker when looking for a substitute from my usual lunch choices of fast food and tacos. So far i have been here twice, once getting the pad see ew and the next for pad Thai. Both times the food was good with the first trip being the heat test so I only got my dish cooked to their "medium" spiciness. A little bite to it but still able to taste. The second time is why holds back the fifth star here. I ordered the "Thai hot" pad Thai. I by no means prefer my food spicy but had to gauge it since the medium was so mild to me. It had its kick definitely, I just feel that someone looking for the burn would be disappointed. Maybe they saw the fear in my eyes that day and showed some mercy but regardless the food was still good and the Thai tea better!

Sake bombs and mackerel. The great price and great location make it a good spot for me to start at before my night out on most weekends. Try to get in early or plan on waiting a little because they get packed really quickly. Not the best sushi I've ever had by any means but I don't remember a time being disappointed at the quality or freshness. They have a variety of the popular rolls people love and some originals that are great as well.

Just wanted something different for lunch so I thought I'd take a small risk and swing by here even though I only had 30 minutes. I got the special oyster and regular campechana. Everything was delicious and the service was great and everything came out quick even though I ordered to go. Definitely going to go back this weekend with my family to try some more dishes. I didn't get back to work on time but it was all worth it.

Great spot to check everything off your list for a sunday. Grab a bite to eat, grab some groceries and maybe a quick snack or drink to cool you down. The parking can be overwhelming sometimes and the place jam packed on weekends but it provides so much.

This place is really...different. The music is always the star but I only ever come if somehow the whole group mistaken thinks they want to come here. They have the great nickname of school of ratchet and it lives up to it. Which isn't bad but I've never gone anywhere else where a girl obviously with a water cup bumped into me spilling her water and told me to buy her a new drink trying to pass it off as an alcoholic drink.

Great little spot to mingle. Only took a few times for my friends and I till we met some regulars that recognize us when we walk in. Drinks are affordable and sometimes a little stiff but that's never bad. The food is enjoyable too which I can't say for most bar food I eat!

Went in on a Friday maybe a little more than an hour before they were closing with a group of 6. Liked the atmosphere of the whole place immediately. They offer valet parking which wasn't necessary(maybe not when our party showed up at least). We were seated right away and greeted by our waitress right away. She got our drinks and dished out the specials answering all our questions and was very helpful with recommendations to the parts of our group that were first timers. The food was excellent starting with the patata pizza, bruschetta and calamari. We were all still trying to decide what to get so we also got the chef's board opting for the combination which didn't last too long. For dinner I got the seared diver scallops which was cooked perfectly on some awesome risotto. Our table got a community bowl of the bolognese our waitress suggested which was as great as she said it would be. All in all a great dinner to which I didn't hear any complaints and would recommend to anyone in the area or looking for somewhere nice to go with a group or on a date.

A nice breakfast joint breaking away from the usual chains I frequent, whether actually for breakfast or after leaving a bar, this place was refreshing. I got the biscuits and gravy and was actually pleased with my choice thinking it was going to be like any other B&G I've had a hundred times before. If I ever finally become a bonafide morning person I'll probably pop by a few more times to try a few other dishes.

I randomly swung by this spot before work just trying to grab something to bite with some coffee before running into work. Best choice I've made all week. Not only did they have blueberry donuts (something I haven't seen since leaving California) but they also had Thai tea! Very nice folks in there too, they can expect to see me more often.

I was shocked to know this place has been here for so long and I'm glad I went to check it out. I went with my brother and all of the pies we got (Hot brown, chicken pot pie, Jamaican beef patty and apple pie) were really good but I definitely regret grabbing a dessert pie because my brother's apple pie was really good. The plaza is a little tight on parking and I almost got backed into so keep an eye out for careless people!

I usually stop by after eating or shopping in the Mekong plaza so the convenience is really awesome. They have a few selections of Vietnamese Che with American names so its always great for dessert and some flavors other boba places don't usually have like mung bean tea. The staff is real nice too and the guy that shouts the drinks makes sure you don't forget your order.

Went for crush festival two weeks ago. It was like a sauna inside literally hot and heavy carrying the stench of BO because there was literally no air moving in the back portion of the center. Another complaint would be the smoking area, which was pretty much inaccessible because it was a double door leading outside to a small fenced off area where people were using to escape the heat. To top it all off too the parking was horrible. The place like everyone else said is in a pretty bad spot too. There were other problems but it seemed to be the promoter's issues but I'm sure it was hard for them with what they had to work with. I'll probably skip any future events here just because I don't ever want to experience anything like that again.

I've eaten here probably once or twice a week since my friend whether dining in or having them deliver to my work down the street. I've almost tried everything and aside from the stinky tofu I just couldn't get used to(but still finished) I haven't had a dish I didn't like.

Before having Charlie as my barber I only really trusted 3 other people cutting my hair. One who doesn't cut anymore and the other two unfortunately are in California. My dilemma was getting as bad as the mop on my head. I met Charlie on a random day hanging out with some friends when he was still cutting in Phoenix who decided to take me on a bad hair day and stuck with him ever since. I'm glad he set up shop here in Chandler because convenience is always great. He always makes me feel welcome, the shop feels like sitting with a bunch of friends in your living room. Charlie is never rushing, if anything he is the complete opposite. He always takes his time and pride in his craft and it shows. Whether from the guy in the seat before you, to the guy stopping by to hang out, all the way till the last person out. I wouldn't trust anyone else!

They were out of shrimp, lobster, and most of the crab so I can't comment on the food but it would have been great to inform our party before seating us and taking our drink orders.

So I came back with a friend to give it another try. This time I got there a little late (9:20PM) so I was almost expecting them to be out of seafood again. I ran into some friends outside who had some opinions about the food but the only one that affected me was their comment on the oysters they got. My friend had told me they had intentions to have the oysters and my friends were telling me they were sandy and poorly prepped. I don't know how it slipped my mind but my friend ended up getting the oysters and only eating two before giving up. I got the trifecta shrimp which was fine. But while I was ordering they of course went through what they didn't have yet again. I'm not sure that's how these restaurants work but I'm glad they had shrimp thawed out this time. Service was ok. The one screw up was that we got a side of rice and it was overlooked and was sitting in the service window before we had to ask for it. Really, I thought the food was good but I can't deal with the place. If it's a gamble every time I order then I can't possibly recommend it to anyone. Maybe third time's a charm. Or maybe I'll have to wait for hot and juicy to open up.

I'm not sure about the rest of the comments but my whole table was colored and we got in just fine and got good deals on bottle service 2 nights this week(Thursday and Saturday). The DJ was good and our service was great both nights. They had to move our table on Thursday night but actually comped us another bottle so no big deal. Can't comment on the food though cause all we had was drinks.

I used to only come here for drinks and always overlooked the menu since I always assumed it was just your usual fried snacks but I recently noticed there was actual food items here so decided to go for dinner the other night. I'm sad Henry's closed because I loved their pork chop and was very happy to see they served the same style pork chop and ordered that and my friend ordered the beef noodle soup. I was very pleased with the pork chop it was perfect and my friend enjoyed the soup. While I was leaving I grabbed a cold smoked chicken and spicy tendon for lunch the next day and those were also amazing. Definitely going to come back again to try their other dishes.

I've been here twice now and it's been great both times. The owner is really friendly and service was quick. The first time I came I got the noodle salad bowl which you can't really mess up but the fish sauce that came with was really good which is probably the most important part. This time I got a classic banh mi and my friend got a shaken beef and we split it. The sandwiches were really good I really liked the pate in the classic. It's a really far drive but I'll make it again.

If you work in the Tempe area and order lunch Earl doesn't have a minimum like the other guys around there and they have a cheap delivery fee too so I often rely on their sandwiches to get me through the day if I don't pack a lunch. Delivery is always on point and their sandwiches are all amazing even when I decided to give up meat for lent I could get their caprese sandwich which was awesome.

A good alternative place to get drinks and hang out with your friends or maybe grab dinner and pregame before starting a alcohol fueled night of debauchery on mill. They have a lot of seating and a mellow atmosphere with games to keep your company and yourself entertained. They have a good beer selection and full bar with your usual fare to their awesome specialty drinks to choose from so no problem on that side.

Set up like the old jeepney's that was here before and the food is still really great. Adobo in every protein was great and I really liked their sinigang. I usually grab the melon drink but they had some green drink which I loved way much more since I love pandan flavors. The new staff and owners are really friendly and I'm glad it's so close to home for me.

I found this place browsing my options for lunch on yelp and I'm glad I did. The delivery was a little longer but its stated on their order page so make sure you order earlier. I'm not super savvy on Malaysian food but I know I love Hainan chicken and this place's rice is REALLY good. The bandung drink was good but I usually opt for the winter melon drink. Everything on the BP platter as well as the beancurd roll was delicious as well but if you're scared of grease watch out for the chicken wrap. I got the Nasi Lemak once as well but the anchovy sauce was way intense for me so I'll stick to the Hainan Chicken.

Awesome new location easily accessible off of the 101 that doesn't differ from the quality of the other location in chandler. They're open all day so its a good alternative that I actually prefer over the usual greasy burrito after a night of drinking.

I came with a group of friends for my birthday for a little drinking and food and this place did not disappoint. When the food says spicy it really means spicy but everything we ordered went so nicely with all of the drinks we ordered. When we showed up it was slow but more people showed up later into the night and the atmosphere was really cool. The staff was super friendly too and were always around when we needed to order more drinks or get more cups. I saw a karaoke machine that the music was playing from too but unfortunately no one was brave enough to use it. Maybe next time we'll order more drinks.

The only reason they didn't get 5 stars from me is because the food took FOREVER to come out. Like we ordered appetizers twice before the food came out slow that evening. The food was amazing though and the service was very friendly even though they were really busy. The garlic chicken I ordered was on the specials portion of the menu but it really reminded me of orange chicken which was good but I was hoping for something else. Their papaya salad was really good and even the medium packed a little heat. The calamari and sauce it comes with was very similar to calamari from kona grill which is not a bad thing because it tastes amazing. We also got a seafood salad to share with the family and that was amazing too. Overall awesome restaurant though I'll have to swing by again and try their curry.

I've been here a few times now and it's been great every time. It's in the new Mekong international market plaza so there's plenty of parking and easy to get to from the 101. The staff is always friendly and quick to refill the ban chan when we ask. All of the sizzling plate meats were great but my favorite thing I've gotten so far is the neck bone hot pot. Definitely my go to Korean spot now.

I'm so glad this place is here since I've moved back from Orange County I can't get che as easily as I did last year. I've been there a few times but mostly I've just gotten the bambu favorite because I love banh lot which is pandan jelly in coconut milk. Definitely a great stop any time during the summer and it's located in the lee lee's plaza where DQ used to be so not hard to find at all.

I'm not a morning person, but I'm a donut person so sometimes I don't hit snooze and make a trip for morning carb goodness and the donut parlor made that morning pilgrimage worth my 10 extra minutes of shut eye. I stopped by in the morning before work for a couple dozen for the coworkers and it was a hit the second I opened the box. I got a dozen cake donuts which they carry on a variety that some of my coworkers have never even had but loved. The real star of the show was the premium cereal donuts though that catch your eye the second you walk in the door. All I could think of was Xzibit saying "Yo I heard you like breakfast so we put some breakfast on your breakfast." The Donut Parlor's amazing donut topped with your favorite breakfast cereal is a combination that just does not fail. The plaza is easily accessible from the 10 and easy to find parking makes it a quick trip in and out in the morning or after work since they're open till 8.
