I am very impressed by this place. I have been to 3 shop around the area and this place by far is the best, great customer service, very clean salon and great techs. This will be my new go to mani and pedi. I highly recommend this salon! I will be back.

I recently pick up a used vehicle here a couple weeks ago, I have been searching and comparing prices on the web with varies of dealership. I got in touch with Brandon which was one of their internet sales rep. We email back and forth a few time as I had some questions with the vehicle I am interested in. We set up an appointment so we can discuss about my interest, I arrived there around 7pm. One of the rep said Brandon left for the day so I got in touch with another rep, no biggie. We discuss about what I wanted to do with my vehicle, we came to a deal, I was going to return this week to make the deal. Brandon emailed me thanking me for stopping in, I told him I would be in a couple of day to do the trade. I asked him a few question about the vehicle, any issues, accident etc. His respond was "the car is great with no issues at all". I said perfect I will be in tomorrow, we made another appointment. I arrived the following day to find out Brand left for the day again even tho we made an appointment, seems like Brandon doesn't exist and he just a virtual dummy to take the blame. We got set-up with the trade and left with another rep. When I got home I have found that the right side mirror doesn't fold in like the left and it flaps when I drive, very unsafe since I can not see my right side. I told it back to get it check out my the dealer, the GM said that they do not cover it since its not a safety concern. How is it not a safety concern when my right mirror is flapping around when driving? All in all DO NOT buy a vehicle from this place and DO NOT trust them. I will not be coming or referring anyone

Just recently got my front screen replaced on my Iphone 5! Very professional and knowledgeable techs, it was much cheaper than using my insurance. This place is kinda hidden in a plaza on 45th st and Thomas. You will not be disappointed, will definitely be back for all my wireless repairs and accessories!   PS. They are the first shop to do back LED upgrade on Iphone! Never seen these before
