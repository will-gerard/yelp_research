It was my first visit to Phoenix's First Friday and Amy D. and I were going to be walking our booties off. We decided a yummy diet deviation would be ok considering the mileage we would be walking. Ok ok..that's what I convinced myself and I dragged Amy, an innocent bystander, along with me.   I had the Chicago Classic which consisted of crumbled sausage, tomato, mozzarella and grated Romano cheese on top of it all. I am a big fan of Uno's pizzas. It lacked nothing. Of course I had to dip every bite in ranch dressing but hey..I was hiking that night, remember?  I don't know whether Uno's is authentic Chicago pizza, but I do know that I love it. It manages to make thick, deep dish pizza, without soggying up the buttery crust.   I can't make this a regular spot, but it's a spot that I enjoy visiting when I embark on a calorie burning night!

Have you ever looked at the every day girl that rings your order up at Starbucks, or the semi-cute chick at the bank and wonder what they would look like topless and shaking their money makers on a stage? Is it just me that has that kind of imagination? Anybody? Well, if you have wondered about that, go to Bandaids to find out.  I had the opportunity to visit Bandaids and I don't regret that I did. We were allowed in after a quick bag check by a bouncer. Another bouncer was nice enough to get us a few tables front and center stage. The service was good and fairly quick considering the number of people in the bar. Some of the guys are a bit pervy of course...offering to buy drinks or lap dances for you in the slight hope that you might be interested in giving them a private dance. No winners that night! Besides, I was there for some boobage!  The women of Bandaids aren't perfect, they don't have fake boobs, they don't have perfect bodies. They are every day women that happen to strip for the dough. I wasn't left panting over any hotties unfortunately, but I was impressed at the bravery of some of the women that got up on the stage and worked it. I felt A LOT better about my body after going to Bandaids and seeing some of the girls there.  Will I go to Bandaids again? Yep! It's a chill place and the girls aren't pushy and I didn't feel at all uncomfortable. It would be nice if they improved the bathrooms for the girls, but that's a small detail. Just hover and you'll be fine! I guess you could say I'm a fan of the dive bar and we were treated very well there. Is it a fancy Scottsdale strip club? Nope. It's your friendly neighborhood strip club to grab a beer, see some boobage, and move along.

What can I say about Guanaquito that has not already been said? This place is fantastic! I have had two opportunities to try their Pupusa plate and it's just fantastic. The pupusas are cooked to a perfect crisp on the outside. The inside is warm with meat and cheese. Even the rice and beans are great. I will hold back on giving the 5 stars because I want to try other dishes besides the pupusas, but I feel that Guanaquito will earn my 5th star and my loyalty easily!

I visited G&D during the Light Rail Pub Crawl. When we walked in, my crew headed straight to the bar. The bar was almost empty so we sat down and waited to be acknowledged by the bartender.... and we waited...and waited until finally I had to get rude and say "Can we get some service here or no?" The tender looked at us like we had just appeared there out of thin air. Ok, I will let that pass. Maybe she was overwhelmed. We ordered our beers and I had to catch her to get a couple menus. Then I had to yell to her that we were ready. Did she just not want our money that day? Were they full up on cash? I ordered the pasty appetizer while my partners ordered hot wings and a basket of chips. My pasty was tasty. I was starving so I'm not sure about authenticity or flavor. They were tasty and HOT on the inside. I thought they were ok. I had to ask for another round of drinks for us even though our empty glasses were staring our lovely bartender right in the face.   I don't know if one goes to G&D for a great dining experience, but we were thirsty and wanted beers as well so our service fell short there too. I was told that a good time to go is in the evening and not to sit at the bar. I'll try that if I ever visit G&D again.

I really like this place. I spent 2 years in Honolulu and used to eat at this great little place in China Town. I have been craving that food since I got off the plane to move back to Phoenix. Well, I found China Chili and I am SO glad I did! The Honey Walnut Prawns are so  yummy! The fried rice and lo-mein noodles are smoky tasting, and hot out of the wok. Is it healthy? Maybe not. Is it non-greasy? Um... not really. Is it delicious when you're craving some really filling Chinese food? Yes. I wish it were closer to my place so I could have it more often, but I'm sure I'm sparing my waistline of more issues!

How have I not sang Scott's praises yet? Well, here I go!   Do you want a place for a good, solid, stick to your ribs breakfast without being too frou frou? Scott's is the joint! It's a Jewish deli in the middle of my neighborhood! I was so surprised that I hadn't noticed it before! Chrissy P invited me to join her for breakfast one morning and I was just blown away! On my first visit, I had the eggs Benedict. My only complaint was that my eggs were a tad overcooked, (not runny) and I wished for more hollandaise sauce.   For my second visit, I brought my little sis and her BFF and we chowed! I had the Hash Mash and we shared an order of the french toast. I don't know why I challenged myself to my own personal "how much breakfast can you stuff into your stomach" contest, but I think I won. Everything was so good! There was nothing to complain about.   I wish I could go to Scott's every day for a hearty breakfast! The dishes are simple, the service is straight forward, and I have NEVER walked away hungry. I will return very, very soon!

Here's a place to go where everybody knows your name, and most of the patrons happen to be gay. I love coming here with My Gays and just hanging out and having some drinks at a neighborhood bar! The crowd is SUPA MIXED. I mean, where else can you go where you can have a hardened biker boy compliment you on your nail polish choice?! It's awesome! I've also been threatened with the stealing of my shoes, as well as asked where one can buy my lipstick (drag queen). The bartenders are courteous and super funny! My fave bartender is Michael. He's a cutie, and is a great pour!  So, whether you're in shorts and a t-shirt, or dressed to the nines, stop in, you'll find a corner to fit into!

Rokerij was on my list of "Places to Eat by My Apartment" that was compiled by my fellow Yelpers. THANK YOU, I owe you guys my first born. Rokerij was fantastic. Give me a good meal, good wine with good friends, and Dottsy is one happy, blissful girl. It was Friday night around 7:30/8pm and the parking lot was PACKED. On round two of looking for parking we got a spot smack dab in front! When we walked in, we were told there was a 45 minute wait. When I looked over the hostess' shoulder, there were three bar stools sitting empty! YAY! We didn't want to eat huge meals because we were due for some country dancing after dinner! We decided to sample the variety of Rokerij by trying their small plate selection. We ended up ordering 6 small plates and a bottle of GREAT Zinfandel. Our selections were the following:   White Bean and Garlic Bruschetta- This was one of my favorites. I am half Guatemalan and this plate reminded me of something my mother would make. The tangy cheese and mild creamy beans were a hit to me. My friends agreed it was good, but weren't crazy about it like I was. That's common. I tend to get really excited about simple dishes.  Steak Tartare: This was my other favorite. The creamy mixture was made before our eyes. We watched the cook meticulously mix and mash the tartare to a creamy perfection. The only thing I would change on this is to make the bread that it's served on thinner. It seemed that our bites were overwhelmed by the thick, crusty bread. My guyfriend and I loved it. My girlfriend isn't a red meat eater so she passed on this one.  Stuffed Mushrooms: These were tasty. I only ate one but it was stuffed with a crab meat mixture that was very meaty, not full of stuffing.  Calamari: This was not a winner. It was served slightly cold, and it was more breading than a meaty bite of calamari. We all agreed we wouldn't be ordering that one again.  Tomatillo Toasts: YUM! This was like an open faced tomatillo enchilada on bread, if that makes any sense. The tangy tomatillo was complimented by the salty and rich flavors of the jamon (thick cut ham) and grilled chicken. Again, I think thinner bread would be a good idea.  New Mexican Sausages: This dish was savory and rich. I'm not much of a fan of sausages, but these were yummy! I only ate one because at this point I was hella full. The onions were cooked to sweet, glazed perfection and the sausages were meaty and not terribly greasy as far as sausages go.  Will we visit Rokerij again? YES. I can see myself becoming a Rokerij fiend! This place impressed me. The service at the bar was hectic but it worked for us. We got to see a lot of "behind the scenes" things. Watching the open kitchen buzzing with non-stop action was amazing. I was fascinated watching the chefs cook a steak to wood fired perfection. Even watching the bread being sliced in 2.2 seconds was amazing!   A small note, when it's a crowded night, Rokerij will limit your visit to 2 hours if you have a table. The only reason I know this is because there was a BIG scene caused when a party was asked give up their table and move to the bar. In Rokerij's defense, the table had been seated for 3 and a half hours. So just keep that in mind.   Run, take a fast car, and some food loving friends to Rokerij and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as we did!

I visited E's Urban hair a few weeks ago to get some red in my head. I arrived on time, and was immediately struck by the crazy cool "Alice in a Funky Wonderland" motif!   After waiting just a short moment, I was greeted by Sherelle. She took me back to her station, offered me a beverage and then got down to business. I told her what I wanted; something a little cool, but something I could get away with in the Corporate American world. I wanted red in my hair somewhere, somehow. She got out a booklet that showed swatches of hair that were dyed. We discussed my hair color and how the color would come out on it. She made a few suggestions, but she wasn't pushy or nonchalant either. We made light conversation, but I didn't feel pressured to tell her my life story or anything, which is nice. I actually like going to a hair salon where there isn't a lot of loud conversation or gossip. Hey, chat away, but be mindful of the stressed out chick trying to chill out next to you! Sherelle was educational about caring for my hair and gave me a few tips to prevent breakage.   The result: Fabulous and pretty! My hair felt healthy and the color that she put in is great! I receive a lot of compliments from my corporate America counterparts as well as my rocking friends. I've already set up an appointment for a return visit. Sherelle was super nice and so impressive, how could I not become a devoted client?

4.5 stars  I had my first date with Jessica F here! It was supposed to be a big group (yeah you FLAKES) but it ended up being just her and I and we were treated like ROYALTY!  Let me get some disclosure out of the way: Thomas was our server, and he is also a friend of mine. That being said, he was professional and courteous. He definitely had his "Top Notch Waiter" hat on that night. You probably wouldn't have been able to tell we are friends.  We indulged in some of the wine specials for their happy hour. Each glass I had was only $6. We decided to try the escargot (nice and garlicky), the pate (delicious) and the frites (they were frites).   The main event of the night for me was the Beef Bourguignon. Omigosh, friends! I dream of this dish to this very moment. The beef was perfectly cooked and the burgundy sauce was FANTASTIC. WHEW! Did it just get warm in here? I was so full and happy after that amazing meal!  I will most certainly return to Sophie's in the hopes of giving them the 5 stars I'm sure they deserve!

I like this spot!   I've been to Dilly Dally twice and each time I've had a good time. This is a place you go when you just want to grab a beer, maybe watch or play some shuffleboard, and shoot the breeze while listening to some jukebox tunes.   A bonus: even though the bar is considered a dive, the bathroom is cute and clean! Score!

Mmmm.... Thai Lahna.  Thai Lahna is the person you spy from across the room that you're not too sure about but then after talking to them you find out that they're pretty damn cool. Yeah, that's my Thai Lahna.  My group walked into the store front restaurant and were greeted immediately. Some of the crew had already arrived and arranged for a large table to be assembled. Nice! We sat down to look over the menu. I already knew that I wanted to order the pad thai because that's my "test dish" for thai places I've never been to. I also selected the masaman curry. There were six of us and everyone got dishes to share.   When the food came out, it was a TON of food. We decided to do the good ol' Yelp Conveyer belt (chomp, chomp, give). My pad thai and my curry were spot on, and perfectly spicy. Everything I had was very good. I don't think I had an issue with anything.   So why not a 5 star review? Simply put it's not the best Thai food that I've had, but it's pretty damn close and the service was a bit lacking.   Thai Lahna is a must try if you're in the mood for some savory, spicy food!

I had the blessed chance to have some wine and pizza at my apartment on a Friday night after a terribly hectic week. Spinato's is a spot that is on my list of places to try in my 'hood. So I called my order in; a large Get Meaty with extra cheese. I went to the store to pick up a bottle of Peachy Canyon Zin, and grabbed my pizza on the way back home. HOLY COW, my pizza was huge! Oh well, I'll have leftovers. It seemed like it took forever to get home because the pizza's aroma wafted through my car and drove me crazy! I got home opened the box, and marveled at the sight of my yummy pizza. The pizza is not sliced into triangles, rather, they are sliced into squares. I grabbed a couple squares and noticed the GREASE that oozed through the cheese on the pizza. Uh oh. I grabbed a few paper towels and firmly patted my pizza. I thought to myself "This is one greasy pizza! This is going to be awesome!" I felt guilty and rebellious taking the first bite of my pizza. I was immediately struck by the sweetness of their sauce! It wasn't too terribly sweet, but I must say I like a slightly sweet red sauce. It may catch some people off guard. The meat on the pizza was delicious! The sausage was flavorful and I think it's home-made. I ended up sticking the leftovers in the freezer for future indulgence. We'll see if it's just as tasty later on.  Spinato's offers pasta dishes which I'd like to try as well a garlic bread and antipasti. I look forward to visiting Spinato's again!

So a word of advice: NEVER take a speed bump at 25 mph. You will get hang time my friend...  So after I tried my Starsky and Hutch move in my g-ride, I had to get a bolt drilled out of my water pump. This was a VERY hard thing to do. I had to finally take it to Crutcher who took care of it in 1.5 days. Mind you, my pal had been working on it for 2 weeks trying to do the same thing that Crutcher did in no time. No one likes to take their car to the shop, I'm not saying that they're the cheapest guys on the block, but they were professional and efficient and got my baby back on the road.  I would highly suggest Crutcher for your g-ride needs!

The Saturday after breaking my liver and recovering from a hangover, I decided that pizza sounded great! I love supporting non-chain establishments, the mom and pop shops of my hood. I decided to order a pizza from Stumpy's.   Meh. It wasn't awful, it wasn't inedible, but it didn't knock my socks off. The sauce was a little plain and I ordered extra cheese on my pizza and got just enough cheese to cover the sauce.  I am willing to try Stumpy's again because the service is so friendly and the pizza is prepared right in front of you. Maybe I should start with a plain pepperoni before going into the sausage and onion realm. Maybe I got a little crazy on my first trip. No...I don't think so, but I'm willing to give them another shot.

You would never guess that I'm a country girl at heart, but if you google my name, you will see that I'm actually named after a country singer. No lie. My Dad is a big 'ol cowboy and his kids were raised with a country streak. Anywho... enough about me. Whiskey River Saloon is a fun spot to get your Country Groove On! It's not fancy, but it's not a filthy dive either. They play a mixture of hip hop and country. If that doesn't make sense, it will when you watch a hot cowboy or cowgirl shake some booty in tight Wranglers. Whew! The drinks are reasonably priced, and the staff is pretty friendly. The dress is VERY casual. I've seen girls in t-shirts and shorts, and I've seen some people really nicely dressed in Cowboy gear. I prefer to slap on some tight jeans, a nice t-shirt and boots myself. One cool thing that the DJ does is a salute to our troops. I'm told that they do it every night they're open, which is cool. Again, this isn't a place to go if you're looking for a refined night out, but it is a fun place to shoot some pool , have a Jack and Coke and dance your butt off with some fun loving friends! Who knows, you might even learn a line dance or two! A must try for something non-clubby and non-meat market.

*** I gave this 5 stars based on the best Mexican food I've had in AZ, not based on white linen and waiter service, just an fyi*** I won't write too much as it seems that everyone already has. Both locations are GREAT. Some of the best "homestyle" Mexican I've ever had. I usually get the double wrapped enchilada combo that is pure saucy heaven! A great place to call ahead on a friday night when you're exhausted from work and not doing jack, pick up your food, pick up a six pack of Pacifico and head on home. Happiness is a sure bet!

I don't understand how this rates so high.  As other reviewers have said, this is not good sushi. It's edible (thus the 2 star rating), but it's not great. I have been to this restaurant 3 times to make sure I wasn't missing anything, and each time I've been only mildly satisfied. They do not serve real crab, their rolls fall apart, and the service is not that great. Maybe I'm going at the wrong time? I have been there during lunch time each time I've gone and have not been impressed at all. On the 3rd try, my friend and I decided that we would not be returning any more.

This is my first to visit this place, though I've passed it several times. My friend and I just finished having days from HELL  at work and we needed some vino to soothe our frayed nerves. I suggested going here to give it a try and also for a change of scenery. Upon walking in, we were greeted warmly. We sat ourselves on two really squishy couches (not comfy). Well, we got our wine order and were left to chat. First thing I noticed, the music. I began to contemplate whether or not  "It takes two" by Robb Base was a good music selection while trying to unwind and chill with a glass of sauvignon blanc..hmm I'm still thinking no. Second thing I noticed was that the really young servers and bartenders were talking about deep issues of the world, but it was the explicative shouted out by the bartender who was making a very serious point, that caught our attention. I believe my friend said "Classsssy!" in response. So I guess that if you want to chill and have a mellow chat, My Wine Cellar is maybe not the place for it. Maybe it was an off day I don't know. On to the wine prices. I've never seen a wine bar that had all one price for all the wines on their list. It's silly. Really. And the happy hour prices aren't that wonderful. The glasses are 10 dollars, but at happy hour they're 8. Not that big of a price break considering 8 bucks is usually a regular priced glass of wine elsewhere. Just an observation. Food... not spectacular. We sent back the hummus platter we ordered because the bread was COLD, I mean out of the fridge, slap it on the plate cold. The hummus was just not tasty at all. And I LOVE hummus. We then got the bruscetta platter, we ordered the basil, tomato,mozzarella, and the sun dried tomato with goat cheese. Both were very tasty. Then we moved on to the chicken sticks with lemon grass. Not my favorite. YES you CAN have too much lemongrass. I don't know if we'll go back to visit My Wine Cellar. I doubt it. At least we gave it the good college try.

So I just got back from taking a solo trip over to Star of India.  I was craving some comfort food, something simple, but yummy, something that would cheer me up on a cloudy day. Something that would make me feel less loser-ish because my lunch buddy had taken the day off and I had to eat solo....cha-ching... Star of India fit perfectly!   I chose to do the buffet because it had everything that I liked. I don't claim to be an expert of Indian cuisine, but I love the sauces and gravies and the rich flavors that are used.   The naan was HOT and fluffy and I scooped up everything with it!  Like I said, this place is nothing fancy, but it was clean and my waitress was friendly. Plus, it made me feel a little less loser-ish.

I love Del Taco. I don't know why, but they are just yummy to me. I only get their chicken soft tacos. Here is how Dottsy eats a chicken soft taco from Del Taco: Open the taco, pour a packet of INFERNO sauce on the taco, spread guacamole over it, and place 3 or 4 french fries inside the taco. Fold one end, the fold in half and take a BIG MESSY bite! Hey..never knock unless you've tried!  I will say that Del Taco uses REAL chicken pieces and every time I eat there my food is hot a fresh, even the yummy crinkle cut fries. Yes, it's a guilty pleasure, but Del Taco is a step up from other fast food Mexican food. I wouldn't even really consider it Mexican food, it's more Calexican food, a mixture of California and Mexican.  Hit Del Taco for a quick fast food fix, you might be surprised!

Who doesn't like a country style breakfast? I'm such a fan of Cracker Barrel and I forget that I work right up the street from it (probably a good thing). My buddy and I were craving breakfast for lunch once again. I think we're on some unspoken quest for the perfect breakfast for lunch place.   I am so glad we headed to Cracker Barrel today. I had "Mama's french toast breakfast". It should be called "Mama's stuff you full because she knows damn well you ain't been eatin' right without her there platter". It came with 4 slices of sourdough french toast, 2 eggs, your choice of bacon or sausage (I chose sausage), and of course I had to order a small side of the hash brown casserole. Of course. I washed all the artery clogging goodness with a large OJ. YUM. Everything came out hot and fresh and with maple syrup. Real maple syrup, y'all! My lunch buddy had the country breakfast that came with eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, and grits! We were both so happy we were giggling like little kids in between bites of the great breakfast. For about the same price of another competitor's breakfast platter, we got a fresh baked, hot off the griddle and huge breakfast. I think we've decided that this is a favorite from now on!  ....or have we???

Mmm... Pita Jungle. I had been craving it all week and finally my lunch buddies decided they wanted to go. This location is BUSY at lunch time; full of corporate type as well as families with children (bad idea to bring kids at lunchtime, it's just WAY too packed). Yesterday we were seated at the bar. I was kind of irritated (only mildly) because when we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess and a guy I assume to be an owner or a "big wig". The "big wig" looked us up and down like we didn't really belong in the place, I really don't know what that was all about. So I asked if we could sit at the bar, we were initially told there was no room, but then an employee that was sitting at the bar decided to move to let us sit (duh). So that little irritation aside, we were seated and greeted again by a very nice bartender/server. I mentioned that I was STARVING and ordered the pita burrito, the bartender asked me if I've ever had the Medchilada. I said no, she said "Oh you must try it, it's full of beans and you can add chicken." PERFECT. After a very short wait, our orders arrived. My friend had the Philly Chicken Pita and the other had the broiled chicken pita. EVERYONE was in pita heaven! My food was so flavorful! The chicken was moist and tender, there were about 3 different beans in the dish. I don't usually eat brown rice because it tends to be crunchy or too grainy, Pita Jungle has managed to make brown rice moist and enjoyable! very nice! The only thing I would change about my food is that it had A TON of chicken in it and it almost overwhelmed the dish. Pita Jungle is and will remain one of my favorite "long lunch" spots!

I just recently had my fourth visit to India Gate for the lunch buffet. I must say the place has grown on me. The selection is large and the food is hot and fresh. The lineup changes often for the buffet but usually consists of a couple curries, masala, a chickpea dish and maybe some goat (which I have yet to try)and rice pudding for dessert.  Service isn't always very friendly or outgoing, but it's all very functional and efficient. Naan is refilled quickly and regularly as are the drinks.  Take time to enjoy the jamming Indian music that is played. You might catch yourself doing some toe tapping. India Gate is a great place for lunch if you want to give Indian cuisine a try or if you're a regular. I highly recommend.

Ah, good ol' 5 and Diner. We walked in and were greeted and seated almost immediately. To my horror we were seated by a Breeder and her 5 kids. One of the kids thought that the restaurant was her playground. She was running and screaming from the juke box back to her table. Honestly, I would have given the place a 3 if a manager had asked the lady to control her spawn. It was an accident waiting to happen and I couldn't hear what my lunch partner was talking about.   I initially went in for a big, juicy burger, but my buddy and I saw a couple breakfast platters go by and it instantly changed our minds. I ordered eggs Benedict which came with a side of hash browns. I also ordered a slice of sourdough french toast. Well after a few mix ups with having to make sourdough french toast, I finally told the waitress to just give me a slice of regular french toast. The eggs Benedict were meh, the hollandaise sauce came out of a packet, I think, but Hey I was at a 5 & Diner. The french toast was very good! Nice and crispy on the outside and warm in the middle. yum.   My pal had a giant waffle with eggs and a side of hash browns. He said that everything was perfect. The waffle wasn't too dry and crispy, and his hash browns were cooked perfectly.  Will we go back? Maybe. We will certainly ask for a table far from kids. Maybe that will bump this place up to 3 stars!

I attended the UYE that Gabi organized and boy am I glad that I did! I was coming off of a horrible, stressful Monday in Corporate America. I was greeted by a friendly receptionist and also the owner of the spa, Heidi Lamar.   It's nice to see someone have a dream and pursue it with passion and excitement. Heidi Lamar is doing just that. The interior of the spa is nice and clean. It has a natural feel with all of the hardwood floors throughout the building.   I was invited to start ridding myself of stress by doing a paraffin dip on my hands. That was heavenly and I felt my cares melting away slowly. I then was taken on a tour of the entire facility. The place is HUGE and very nice! I went back into the common area and was invited to have a chair massage... ahhhh this evening is getting better and better! After my massage, I had my gnarly brows waxed. It's amazing what a little hair removal can do for your face. I highly recommend getting your brows done here to guys and girls! The aesthetician that did my brows was not only good, but she was educational about my skin and brows. After all that, I sat down to get my makeup touched up. This is where I wasn't as pleased. Bless the guy's heart, the artist had NO clue on what colors to use on my skin. He was SO excited to do my makeup, so I let him just go to town! I looked like a really dark Barbie with really BRIGHT lipstick... can you say radioactive tangerine lips? If you want something done right... do it yourself. Ahh well, my makeup is a mystery to many artists. It wasn't his fault. He tried.  Is it the Phoenician? No. It's an "Everyday Spa" that is comfortable and clean with super friendly and professional staff. I hope to visit Lamar Spa again, to spend the day and be pampered! For now... I'll just dream of my return....while I sit in my Corporate American Cubie....

I've tried Golden Egg Roll twice. Once for delivery and once in the restaurant. BLECH! Both times. Actually ICK the first time, MEH slash ICK the second time. The delivery is quick and efficient. I ordered the House Fried Rice and a veggie egg fu young. I was grossed out by the shrimp in the fried rice. I could SMELL my shrimp before it even entered my mouth. Sounds normal right? No it was FUNKY shrimp that was slightly slimy. Blech. My Fu Young was unremarkable after you got past the saltiness of the dish.  Months later, I was asked by a coworker to have lunch. I let her pick the place... I will never make that mistake again. She picked Golden Egg Roll. The restaurant itself is nice and clean from what I saw. I chose the orange chicken. Again with the salt! I was baffled and I asked the other ladies I was with if they were having the same issue. Yes, they were! Well that summed it up for me.  I probably won't visit Golden Egg Roll again. What a bummer, they have all this swag from a service (they probably paid for) naming them one of the top Chinese restaurants in the area. I'm uninterested in giving this joint another shot, unfortunately. There are too many other places to try.

How simple, yet intricate can a country breakfast be? What makes it different than a breakfast you would make yourself, or grab in the city? Is it because it's made with love, made with lots of fat, or is it because you're not in a rush to eat it? Probably all of the above. I was starving and taking a drive with Mr. Hottie and Erin. We were passing through Wickenburg and I wanted breakfast. I suggested we stop at a cafe we passed. When we walked in, it seemed as though the whole town of Wickenburg was in the cafe! It was packed and hopping full of locals. We city slickers seemed to stick out like sore thumbs. Oh well, no matter, we were greeted warmly. An adorable old man gestured for Mr. Hottie to come over and lend an ear. He told him that if we were thinking of leaving, to "wait. This is the best breakfast". Soon after, a table cleared out. We were greeted by a very friendly waitress who gave us time to look over the menu after taking our drink orders. I always want a little of everything when I go to breakfast. I decided on a bacon cheddar omelet with a side of hashbrown, and sausage gravy and one pancake..whew! I don't mess around with breakfast, my friends! I sipped on my OJ and played black jack (cards are at the table) with my breakfast partners. It wasn't very long until our food arrived. My OJ was refilled and my hot, steamy food was delivered. My omelet was FLUFFY and full of cheese and bacon! The hashbrowns were fresh cut, and well cooked. I was a happy girl. I poured the sausage gravy over the top of the omelet. PURE PURE HEAVEN!! This is THE BEST sausage gravy I have EVER had. I wanted to spoon it into my mouth! The sausage wasn't fatty (chunks of fat mixed with meat), it was flavorful with just a hint of spice. The gravy was also seasoned well. My pancake was HUGE. It was bigger than a regular sized dinner plate and fluffy! Oh my goodness it was so good! Of course I didn't finish my food, but I surely tried! I think I waddled out of the restaurant! We didn't eat anything else until we got back into Phoenix around 7pm if that tells you how filling and delicious our breakfasts were!   I'm looking forward to the next road trip that takes me back to the New Frontier Cafe! The service was great and the food was delicious!

Pretty much the most amazing chicken and waffle experience I've ever had.  I went to LoLo's with Robert and Bacon on a Sunday morning. We were only made to wait for a short time before we entered the shrine of soul food. We were greeted very warmly and asked what we wanted to drink. I had the sweet tea. I usually LOVE sweet tea but they were not messing around! Next time I'll order 1/2 sweet and 1/2 regular tea. For my meal, I got the 2 piece and a waffle. We chose several sides to share between the three of us. We had the red beans and rice, mac and cheese, collard greens and fried okra.  I was amazed when the food arrived at the table. The waffle was hanging off of the side of my plate and smelled like heaven probably should! I tried the fried chicken and I was taken back to my childhood. The chicken was well seasoned and has a bit of baking powder bite to it! AMAZING. It wasn't at all greasy or soggy in any way. My mouth is watering just typing this review. In the background, there was great gospel music playing so I hope that getting a dose of Jesus while eating fried chicken might banish any of its artery clogging properties.... yeah....  We were checked on several times to see if we needed anything and we were treated cordially. I will visit LoLo's any time, any day as long as someone is there to share the guilt with me!

Have you ever walked into a place and said to yourself "Oh... I'm going to have a lot of fun here!" It happened to me on Saturday night. I walked/stumbled into Char's buzzing off of Patron and was immediately hit by a dose of FUNKY COOL. I met Amy D, Kevin M, Nathan S, and Amanda B for Amanda's b-day, and I am so glad that I did!   I walked in and was greeted by Amy. After paying a 6 buck cover and getting a skin staining hand stamp, we headed to the bar where I was greeted by a friendly bartender. I ordered a Patron drink and was told by the waitress standing next to me that a mystery man had paid for my drink. SHWEET! We headed to our group's table. On our way there, I was growled at by a very big man. Judging from his hulking size and neanderthal like stance, I assumed that grunts and growling were his only means of communication. That was until another guy growled at me on my way to the restroom!! I finally was like "WHAT?"  Ohhhh, I get it, that's the "cool" way to tell me you think I'm cute! Gotcha.... ick. Sorry fellas, if you think it works, it doesn't. Try "Hello, how are you" instead. Just sayin'.  The live band that was playing on Saturday was GREAT. They played a lot of old school music that got my booty shakin! I even had to take Amanda out on the floor for a spin! So much fun! I might have to make this a stop for my b-day bash! It was that much fun!  The customers of this place was a mixed bag, but for the most part very nice! I even met a guy named Robinson Crusoe... no lie! I even checked his ID. There were your average pervs, the ones who try to touch or rub on you, but with a threat of mace to the face.... yeah that was avoided easily.  Char's is a little divey, but a cozy place where the people are friendly for the most part (stop that growling), and the service is great! Go there for dose of "Funky Cool"!

I had the pleasure of visiting FBH with my fave Foodie Bear and Robert a while back. (Yeah I'm behind on reviews). All I can say is WOW. I have become a fan of FBH. We walked in to a small, clean space. You order your yummy meal at the counter and you have to be quick to grab a table! My advice, grab a table then go order. For my yummy meal I had the fry bread with beans and green chile. I was delighted to see that I could wash my guilt-ridden meal down with Big Red Cream soda...mmm.. When I bit into my fry bread it was crispy and light on the outside and nice and chewy in the middle. It was so good. I wished for a little more spice or flavor from the green chile sauce, but it still did the job. We also tried the chocolate and butter fry bread. It was so-so in my opinion, but I'm not much of a sweets person so definitely not a knock on FBH!   I will certainly visit FBH again maybe after I do a giant work out or have been fasting for 5 days... it's just too good to eat on a regular basis!

The Billet Bar is an awesome Scottsdale Biker bar. I will admit that I have become friends with one of the bartenders there, but I'm reviewing the scene, not her.   As far as biker bars go, the Billet is by far one of the nicest and cleanest that I've been to. The music is a mixture of rock, country, and some hip hop thrown in. There are two bars in the club, one that is inside right when you walk in, and another in the back area. The bar is well decorated with lots of chrome, diamond plate and leather.   I make this a regular stop whenever I'm in Old Town because it's just a fun, laid back environment. I hope you give it a try too.

It's no secret that I love cowboys. I love anything that has to do with cowboys. One day, I will make a cowboy mine...*ok calming down now* So the decision to dine at Cowboy Ciao was a no brainer!  Next, I need to scold myself: WHY haven't I been to Cowboy Ciao for a meal before??? BAD Dottsy! BAD! Moving on...   I visited CB's with two friends and didn't know I was going to be hit upside the head with some REALLY. GOOD. FOOD. We were greeted and seated immediately, which was quite a surprise for a Friday night, but there was a table just about to leave so we lucked out.   I decided on having the special of the evening which was the Harris Ranch Rib-eye with creamy spaghetti squash. My dear Yelpers, I dream about the dish to this day! I had it perfectly rare which made me a very happy Diva! The spaghetti squash was perfectly cooked and perfectly creamy. It was amazing! I am batting my eyelashes blissfully as I type these words.   We also split a dessert that was equally delicious, but I don't remember exactly what it was. I do remember a chocolate cup filled with a peanut butter mousse. Fab! Oh wait! How could I forget the cup of chocolate with chili mixed in? Again, another GREAT dessert...  So why not 5 stars? I have yet to return to CB and you all know I don't give it all away on a first date! I excitedly await my next visit to Cowboy Ciao. The food was masterfully prepared and I enjoyed my entire visit!

4.5 stars  Oh House of Tricks, you are a sneaky devil aren't you?  Did you know I was coming? Is that why you pulled out all the stops for my visit? Did you know you were flirting with someone who doesn't give 5 stars freely? Is this always how you are, or are you only charming when good company is around? Well if you keep it up, you're going to get hit with 5 stars!   I have visited House of Tricks three times. The first time I was on a hot date with a couple and a dog (yeah, that's how I roll). We sat out on the bar patio and decided to order a few dishes to share with each other. We started with a cheese plate that was very good and did not lack variety. For the entree I chose the beef tenderloin rare. The other entree that was picked was the vegetarian lasagna. Now, with me being a well known carnivore I will say that I was nervous about a vegetarian dish. We were served a bread basket with butter. Here's one of my pet peeves: Cold bread with cold butter. Never the twain shall meld. One must be warm! Give me a softened butter on cold bread or warm bread with cold butter. Get it? Moving on.  Our dishes arrived after a short wait. Ah and how beautiful it was! The tenderloin was on a bed of mashed potatoes and greens and tasted wonderful! The meat was perfectly cooked! Now to try the lasagna! Omigosh! What a surprise! The lasagna was so delicious that I almost pushed aside my steak to eat the lasagna...almost. I sat back full and astonished at the great meal I just had!   The second visit I had was lunch with a coworker. I chose the Chili Rubbed Hanger Steak. It came with Asadero cheese stuffed tortillas with roasted Ancho sauce, avocado puree and cilantro rice. Perfection! Absolute perfection! Everything was delicious, flavorful and well executed! I'm not a fan of cilantro and I even enjoyed the rice! The visit was certainly a 5 star visit.   My third visit was for a dear friend's birthday dinner. I was so excited to go! For an appetizer I chose the foie gras and fig appetizer. It was so decadent. The mixture of savory/salty foie gras with a sweet fig mixture was heavenly! For my main dish I went with the tenderloin on top of a greens mixture and mashed potatoes. Everything was great until I started tasting WAY TOO MUCH salt. I am a salt lover and it turned out that the potatoes were oversalted. I called our servers attention to it and and she brought another dish out with just sauteed greens. It was perfect!   I adore House of Tricks. Their menu changes with the seasons and there is always something new I want to try on the menu. If it weren't for a couple VERY SMALL issues, I would give them 5 stars in a heart beat! I look forward to visiting the restaurant again VERY soon!

Pedro's is great for Mexican style comfort food. It's a real neighborhood gem. I've loved Pedro's since the first time I tried it in 1996.  I always go in and order the green chunky beef enchiladas with rice and beans. The green chile is not hot at all and it is almost broth-like. The rice is cooked and seasoned perfectly. The service is always a little touch and go. Sometimes you find a waitress in a good mood who is attentive and then you find one that's strictly business with barely any warmth. So don't go there for hugs and kisses, just good food! Pedro's is a fixture in Glendale, and I hope it's there for many more years!

I love going to Amsterdam to mingle with my LOVELY Gays and dance my booty off. I really like the way this place is decorated. The drinks are slightly pricey but worth it. I don't think I've had a bad pour there. I won't write too terribly much, but recommend it for anyone, Gay or Straight, who likes to dance, have some good drinks and chat up whomever admires and subsequently worships your large boobs... oh wait... that was just me.  Anyway, I recommend highly!

I just don't get it. I don't understand why Barrio is such a hit. Did I hit my head and lose my sense of taste? I doubt it.   Barrio isn't horrible, but it certainly is not the most amazing Mexican cuisine that I have had. Barrio is the place that a guy who thinks he's in touch with La Raza (even though he grew up in Scottsdale)and takes his girlfriend to "a little place in the ghetto" he knows. For those of us that know what the Barrio is like, Barrio Cafe doesn't live up to its self proclaimed title of "Comida Chingona".   I had the pleasure of having dinner at Barrio with my friend Ayesha. One thing that Barrio Cafe does have going for it is their super potent margarita. Maybe that's what makes all the patrons think that the food is so amazing. I had a top shelf margarita. It was really good! The tequila was smooth and the the margarita mix was not too sweet, and not too sour! I overheard our bartender explaining that the margaritas are 50 percent tequila and the rest is mix. Nice! I should have drank more, maybe this review would be a little better for them.   We were seated and greeted by a friendly waiter. He asked us if we would like the fresh made guacamole. Ayesha and I were both excited to try it. He brought around the cart and explained all that went into the guacamole. Well he mashed a bit and then served it to us....um... that's it? Really? It was chunks of avocado with the rest of the ingredients. Ok, you might impress some fools with that mess, but with those of us with mamas that have old, well used molcajetes... this guacamole isn't cutting it one bit. I had to snicker as one half drunk patron next to us declared this was the best guacamole she ever had. *sigh* I was not impressed at all. Hopefully my dinner was better prepared.   For my dinner, I had the enchiladas de mole. They came with sauteed zucchini, which was different than the standard rice and beans you get at other places. The enchiladas were beautiful when they were delivered. The aroma of the mole sauce hinted at their rich flavor. I took my first bite... well.. I guess they were ok. I expect mole to be a dark, spicy (not necessarily hot), never too chocolaty, and a perfect balance of smoke and spice. This took a good run at it but came up short, and I could really taste the chocolate of the mole. The vegetables that they were served with were overcooked and had no flavor to them. I was given a free flan for my birthday which was very nice! The flan was good! It wasn't too jiggly (which Ayesha was fearing) and I believe it might be homemade. Good touch!  Well, I can at least say that I tried Barrio cafe. I would probably go back for their great margaritas and maybe try a different appetizer, maybe after a few more of those strong 'ritas, I'll find out what all the fuss is about.

I love coming to this place with my wide range of friends. I usually go with "My Gays" and enjoy copious amounts of martinis.  This is my 3rd or 4th time going. I went with two of my friends for some appetizers and drinks this past Friday and it was so yummy. We ordered the fries with the 3 dipping sauces, the galletes, and the bacon wrapped water chestnuts. Everything was very good and provided a great base for the drinking that was going on.   While the drinks were rather pricey, they were very good. You get about a drink and a half if you order a martini. My girlfriend and I ordered pomegranate martinis and they were just divine! I loved that they weren't sweet and syrupy like I usually get.   Go there to get the night started with some yummy apps and GREAT people watching. I don't care if the men are gay or straight, they were HOT and dressed fabulously!   Can't wait to hit AZ88 again!

4.5 Stars  Delmonico does not disappoint!   I had the wonderful luck of visiting Delmonico for my birthday dinner in Vegas. I was beside myself with excitement to try an Emeril restaurant!  Prior to our 8:30 reservation, we sat in the lounge to take pictures and have a drink. Our hostess came to get us when our table was ready.  We were greeted by our friendly waitress (her name escapes me) and were all seated quickly. She took our drink orders and delivered them quickly. She let me peruse the VAST wine list at my leisure and explained the specials of the evening and gave the market price of the items on the menu.   I decided on the bone-in rib steak with broccoli and bacon cheddar grits. In the meantime, I ordered a bottle of Klinker Brick Zin and our EVER observant, and discreet waitress whispered in my ear to inquire on the preference on whether I would like her to present the bottle just to me or would I like her to present it to the rest of my drunk and (embarrassingly) rowdy guests. What a professional. I won't even get into how I handled the two of my 4 dinner partners and their TERRIBLE manners, but let's just say I won't be seeing them anymore.   Finally, dinner arrived. My steak was beautiful. Well, cooked, not quite as rare as I had hoped, ah well. A rare steak seems to throw cooks, I don't get it. The sides were HUGE and beautiful. The broccoli was fresh and not over steamed so they still had a slight crunch to them. My bacon and cheddar grits were so rich and savory. I could only have a few bites of them before my stomach couldn't take anymore. Delmonico was nice enough to deliver chocolate ice cream at the end and wish me a happy birthday! What a lovely ending to a chaotic dinner!   I hope to enjoy Delmonico again soon, and with better dinner partners!

I had one of my Vegas dreams come true when I got to have dinner at Craftsteak. Mr. Hottie arranged the evening all I had to do is show up and look pretty! I arrived in the midst of fighting a migraine. Not good. I wasn't sneered at because I walked in with a bottle of Coke and a bottle of Excedrin as my accessories next to my purse. We were seated immediately. The table we were seated at was an end part of a VERY VERY large booth if you can picture it. So we were facing another party and were almost too close to them. I was hoping for something a little more intimate. We were left to sit for a tad too long. Nothing major, but it was noticed by both of us. I had time to go to the restroom and come back before we were greeted. Our waitress was very nice (and I forgot her name). We started out with a cocktail (glass of Prosecco for me) while we looked over the menu. Our waitress came by to check on us and to suggest that we try the Summer Tasting Menu. She even PROMISED that we would not be disappointed. At first, we thought we would pick one of each offering from each course. Wrong. We got the WHOLE menu! We went with that and added the wine pairings to go along with the courses. Let me list what was on the menu and my thoughts:  First Course  Shaved Fennel Salad: Zesty and fresh  Grilled Quail, Vincotto: Yum, very flavorful  Buffalo Mozzarella, Red Pepper Caponata: This was pretty good. Nothing earth shaking  Persian Cucumber Salad: I wasn't a huge fan, but it was personal taste more than anything.  Main Course:  Prime Beef Flatiron: This was my favorite cut of meat served medium rare and full of flavor. Very well seasoned  Angus Skirt Steak: WOW another steak! I wasn't as thrilled with this cut, surprisingly. It was still good though.  Diver Sea Scallops: Perfectly cooked. The scallops were sweet and firm.  Sides:  Yukon Gold Potato Puree: Thrilled to have had these. If you want me to be happy. Take a simple dish, and make it WELL. These were so good!  Sauteed Sweet Corn: Another winner. The corn was sweet and juicy!  Roasted Shiitake Mushrooms: Not a winner. The mushrooms seemed to be overcooked, and rubbery.  Dessert: I can't remember what it was, unfortunately. Mind you, I had wine with every course. By the end I was filled to the brim and VERY happy!  Since we were the last reservation seating for the evening, we basically shut the restaurant down. Keep in mind, this is a leisurely paced dinner, not a quick bite. Craftsteak was a wonderful experience. Not everything was perfect, but it was very close! I will go back to eat there in a heart beat! Craftsteak brings up memories of an old school steak house, but their menu items are fresh, modern and not to be missed!

For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.

So I was craving bbq a while ago and asked my lunch buddy to try this place with me. He looked at me funny and said "YOU have never been there??" So off we went. Famous Dave's has the regular decor you would expect at a BBQ joint; wooden furniture, country decor... very standard. We were greeted and seated quickly. A VERY flustered waitress came to our table nearly out of breath and asked "Have you guys been helped yet??" I sighed silently, bracing myself for poor service. To my relief a very polite waiter came over and said that he had taken our table and would be very happy to help us. GOOD call! Our waiter could not have been more polite and fast. I just wish I could remember his name because he was awesome!  I was famished so I got the baby back and meat combo. For the meat I chose the hot link sausage. Our waiter explained each of the sauces that were on our table to us. He even told us our food would arrive in 5-10 minutes. DING! 8 minutes later, my food had arrived in front of me. With the meat, I got two sides which were macaroni and cheese, and green beans. Man was everything good! The ribs were nice and tender, the hot link was smoky, but not terribly spicy. It was so good! The macaroni and cheese is REAL macaroni and cheese. If you eat comfort food, you know what I mean. The green beans had potato and onion in them which is yet another southern touch! I loved everything and it was a lot of food.   I don't know if I can make Famous Dave's a regular stop, but I would love to! I will return there again next time I'm craving good bbq!

"Kismet:  (Islam) the will of Allah  - kismat  An event (or a course of events) that will inevitably happen in the future  - destiny, fate"   That's the word that popped into my head after a wonderful evening at Cibo. A motley group of friends met up for dinner and left very, very happy.   We met around 7pm at Cibo. We were immediately seated at the front of the house next to the bar. The bartender was our waiter and he was super friendly and very helpful. We decided to each order a pizza so that plates could be passed around and pizzas shared! I'm glad that was what the decision was because I tried several different pizzas that night.   The server was very helpful in selecting the wine that I chose to drink that night. He asked me what I liked to drink as far as American standards and suggested great Italian wines. He even came to suggest certain pizzas as well as aperitifs!   I ordered the Bruschetta... it was delicious. The entire table enjoyed that appetizer. Once the main meals arrived, we realized that appetizers weren't needed.   For my meal I ordered the Prosciutto Crudo. The dough was well cooked but not too hard that you could take a good chewy/smoky bite out of it. There were plenty of toppings and everything was high quality. I was amazed!   At the end of the meal we just HAD to indulge in the crepes. I chose the Nutella and chocolate crepe....heaven. Of course I shared and everyone agreed that the crepe was amazing.   To finish our dining experience off, we indulged in aperitifs of Lemoncello and some kind of yummy chocolate liqueur.   Of course from start to finish I was happy. Our service was spot on, the food was FANTASTIC, and the drinks were wonderful. It was fate that our crew hit that spot right then, right there... I honestly do not have one complaint, one criticism, one bad thing to say about Cibo.  I hope to catch a moment of kismet again!

***This review is for Fez's Brunch*** For some reason, on Sunday mornings/early afternoons, I crave Eggs Benedict and Mimosas. Is it the snob in me rearing her head? Maybe. I prefer to believe it's my inner goddess in need of some pampering.   2 weeks ago, I somehow awakened my inner goddess and the craving for a nice brunch was almost unbearable. I text Amy D and about 30 minutes later, we were at Fez.  I ordered a 5$ mimosa and began to peruse the brunch menu for something that would please my goddess-like tummy. Ah! Fez Benedict! What a delight! Poached eggs on small slices of french bread with ham, manchego cheese, oven dried tomatoes, & hollandaise sauce..mmm. I ordered the garlic and rosemary fries instead of the red potatoes that are normally served. On top of both of the great items on the plate, Fez also adds a beautiful salad on the side of everything. Everything ran together beautifully. The eggs were poached perfectly and the bread soaked up the hollandaise and the egg yolk but it managed to stay firm and chewy and didn't get mushy or soggy at all. The fries were tasty, but they seemed to lack any garlic and they were served with plain ol' ketchup. Eh.. I wish there was something a little more creative, but oh well. I sipped yet another mimosa and let the flavors of everything mingle on my tongue... what a great breakfast.  The check came and I was SO surprised at the budget friendly price! I know Fez can cater to my inner goddess and I look forward to visiting them many more times!

Yep! You read right! 5 stars! I don't take rating a place with 5 stars lightly.   Sushi Eye is the best Sushi that I have had in Arizona. All the fish is fresh and I have NEVER been displeased with anything they have served me. Having spent two years in Hawaii where fish is pulled out of the ocean and sliced into sashimi, I know what fresh fish tastes like. Believe me, short of being pulled from the ocean and immediately served, this is about as fresh as you're going to get in Arizona.   I have been to Sushi Eye about 6 times, with this visit being my 7th. Yum! I had the Climax 2 roll (a Hamachi roll that lives up to it's namesake), the Crazy Horse (tuna, salmon, yellowtail), and the Scallop roll (fresh bay scallops). Umm...yeah... I was hungry. Every single bite was fresh and delicious. Try the Hamachi. It is beautiful and tasty.  I washed it all down with hot green tea!   Our server was very friendly and chatted briefly with us even though the place was busy at lunch time. I will say that my lunch partners had to wait a little longer than usual for their non-sushi lunch but I think the kitchen was a little backed up with large party orders. I'll cut them some slack this time, but if service lags, I'll have to cut a star...don't make me do it!!!   Go to Sushi Eye if you truly enjoy Fresh, raw fish. The service is friendly, the food is good, and the restaurant is unpretentious. I will continue to make this a regular stop for lunch.

I went to Chelsea's a while ago and I cannot wait to return. Fantastic! We started with the tuna tartar and guacamole (umm... heaven!) My friend had the filet and I had the special which was lobster tacos. Simply delicious. The filet was SUPER tender and SUPER tasty. The tacos were delicious! The lobster was moist and tender and the tortillas were delicious and handmade! Yes it is a little pricey but you get what you pay for and it was well worth the few extra dollars. Great food and great atomosphere!

Ahh Carly's. What can I say about you that doesn't sound mean? Not much!   I like that Carly's has cheap beer specials and sometimes feature live music. I don't like that Carly's is run by nonchalant hippies that aren't keen on giving good service and I have to question the hygiene of their dreadlocks...umm yes I know what CLEAN dreadlocks look like...those aren't it.   The food...not impressed. I had the caprese panini and it was soggy inside. Not just a little damp; no no, I was scraping soggy dough out of the middle of the sandwich.   I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food. I might go back for a drink.

I visited Lisa G's some weeks ago with a couple of cool chicks. I was excited to finally be going to have dinner there as I had heard so much about the place, I had been dying to try it myself. We arrived to Lisa's "house" and I was surprised at the simple but elegant decor. We waved a hello to Lisa who was behind the bar and were greeted by our waitress. Ah.. our waitress. I usually like to engage whomever is serving us and get their thoughts on food and wine. Our waitress seemed disinterested in any of that. In fact when we asked what a certain red table wine was a blend of she just replied "I don't know." She should have said "Let me go find out." Oh well, minor detail, but that stuff irritates me.  We perused the simple and small menu. OF COURSE I had to have a bowl of balls! Oh my gosh... the balls...were just....so tasty! The dish came covered with PLENTY of sauce on top, a slice of bread, and a slice of parm that just crumbled over the balls. Want to make me wag my imaginary tail? Make a simple dish, but make it VERY well. I was delighted that such a seemingly simple dish such as the bowl of balls brought so much flavor to the table with good quality ingredients. The fantastic food made me forget out lackluster waitress. That's key!   I will definitely be back to Lisa G's to try her other dishes....or maybe just have another bowl of balls!

Amy D. and I were trekking through the First Friday scene when something told me to look to my left.  I looked over and immediately shouted "OMG Tammie Coe!" as though I had just spotted Angelina Jolie. Amy and I made a beeline right to their door.   I selected a brownie to try while Amy chose the "Ooey Gooey" cupcake with such fervor I thought she was going to faint before finishing her order. 2.75 later, I walked out with my treat. I tore off the first bite and popped it into my mouth. I had to stop and look down at what I just bought! I think they gave me a piece of heaven in a little paper bag! It was gooey on the inside and lightly crispy on top. "YUMMMMMMM" was all I could say! I force fed Amy a bite because I just had to share the joy I was feeling. She too saw Nirvana.   I can't wait to go back and try one of their BEAUTIFUL cakes. My 30th b-day is coming up and they might be commissioned to make my dream cake! I hope Tammie Coe and I form a beautiful friendship. It would be nice to have a "celebrity" in your corner!

Last Friday was my second visit to Lola. Ah.. my darling Lola. How I love you. Maybe I love Lola because it's a cozy (sometimes crowded) place with communal seating. Maybe I love it because I'm nosy and like to engage random unknown people in deep conversation. Or maybe I just love simple and delicious food.   Lola Tapas offers a limited menu that consists of favorites from Spain. The last time I was there myself and two pals had about 6 plates and a sangria for about 30 bucks each (that included tip). Is it pricey? Yes, but it is also well made and delicious. I highly recommend the fillet and and the tortilla de patatas. Do not go to Lola expecting Mexican dishes. An example is the tortilla is not a masa based flat bread. It's actually more of an omelet but not as "eggy". Just try it. You will be so glad you did. The ingredients are so fresh and well crafted, that it's hard to mess up here.  Our waiter was very friendly and quick. He even recognized me from my first visit. Any of the servers are there to help you so don't be afraid to ask any one of them for something. They all share gratuity so everyone is glad to help where they can.  I won't write too much about my love affair with Lola, but I do know that it will happen again and again. My devotion for Lola is strong.   Grab a few good friends who are fellow foodies and visit Lola. Tell her I said hello!

I think I'm in love. For any of you who have spent time in East LA, Tradiciones is very reminiscent of that scene. I arrived to have dinner with Julia and Amy. I was exhausted and hungry. We were greeted and led into a HUGE dining room. I knew I was going to fall in love. Did I like the dumb dresses the ladies have to wear? No, but it makes the tourists and non-hispanic people feel comfortable.  I usually set my bar on the quality of food based on the chips and salsa. We were served a fresh basket of chips and each given a personal bowl of salsa! Hooray for double dipping! The manager was walking around and he stopped by to say hello and then brought us a complimentary bowl of guacamole With three lovely ladies each with a fab pair...of.... I mean each with great personalities, what do you expect? So far so good! I had a margarita that was served in a martini glass full of ice... hmmm is that weird to anyone else? Oh well. The marg was good!  For my entree I chose the enchiladas suizas with chicken. What I was served was definitely YUMMY! The tortillas were fresh and they were soft fried. Fabulous, authentic touch! The suizas sauce was slightly tangy. The tanginess was offset by the cotija cheese that was generously sprinkled on top. The word that came to mind every time I took a bite was "creamy". It was a very well made enchilada. The beans and rice were pretty good too. Here's my thing about re-fried beans. I like them when they're made with manteca (LARD) *GASP* and these were more than likely made with them. The re fried beans were flavorful. The rice was eh.. ok. It was rice. I sort of wished for a bit more spice in the rice, but again, it makes the tourists feel safe.  An added bonus were the roaming musicians that they had. I was relieved to see that they were not in Mariachi suits but rather nice slacks and blazers and they were SINGING it. I wish I had more energy because I would have been whistling and doing a good ol Grita Mexicano along with the guys at the bar that were enjoying the entertainment! I look forward to enjoying Tradiciones again!

It was a dark and windy Bike Week 09 type of night. After spending most of the evening at West World, surrounded by hot biker boys... I was hungry.   I suggested hitting Corbin's for some food and drink. I had never been to Corbin's before and I'm glad we went in for a quick bite. When I opened the door to Corbin's I was hit by a semi-swanky vibe. I was certainly glad I wasn't all "Dirty Harleyed" out. I was more "Harley Hookered" out which, in my mind, is more swanky bar vibe acceptable.  We were greeted warmly and seated at a table in full view of a family that was VERY interested in our presence (it could have been my super low cut shirt...hmmm...sorry about that...not really.). I even waved! I love my "adoring" fans who found themselves back to being busy with events at their own table.  Anywho... back to the events at my table!  After ordering a glass of wine (and being told they were out of my first choice..grr) I finally scored a nice glass of pinot noir. I also went with the grilled cheese sandwich. It wasn't just any ol' grilled cheese, my dear yelpers! This yummy sammie had cheddar, swiss and queso fresco cheese and it was all grilled with thick-cut bacon and a good hunk of tomato. I chose whole wheat for my bread. It was WONDERFUL. The home-cut fries were so good and they have yummy ranch to go along with it! My biker boy chose the Cajun Tasso ham quesadilla. Again... so yummy! The ham was nice and spicy but not HOT, just had some nice seasoning going on. The quesadilla is the size of a small, thin-crust pizza. So it can easily satisfy one person with leftovers to take with them. The whole meal was surprisingly VERY good!   I only wish that Corbin's chairs were more comfortable to allow for some serious lounge time. I could imagine myself lounging after a great meal and just soaking in the swanky atmosphere. They have a nice bar area and also have hip music playing in the background.   I look forward to another visit to Corbin's. I promise to not come dressed like a Harley Hooker next time... or not.... we'll see! Continue to surprise me, and I might surprise ya back Corbie!

I recently ate here again. The food was delivered prior to the promised LONG wait, and it was HOT and fresh. I have now become a devout fan of this little Chinese takeout place! My dinner guest was equally as impressed with all of the food. I will say that I thought that the sweet and sour was a little dry, but everything else was delicious. We were impressed that they didn't shirk on the shrimp and the shrimp were large and delicious! Is it gourmet and to be served on white linen? No. It's Chinese takeout that you eat in your sweats in front of the TV.    Just wanted to show Chen and Wok some love with another star!

3.5 stars  Remember when Hot Pockets were the best invention EVER? Well now there's a restaurant that is totally dedicated to a fancy hot pocket filled with tasty treats! Yup, Cornish Pasty Co!  After promising myself that I would try this place for way too long, I decided to go with a co-worker for my first visit. For my first trip to CPC, I chose the Tikka Masala pasty. It was pretty good! I guess I was hoping for a serving of spicy, somewhat creamy, and savory tikka masala served in a hot pocket. What I got was a good hot pocket full of chicken and some sauce. Not nearly has juicy and spicy as I had imagined it would be, but still good. I chose the peanut butter and jelly pasty for a dessert to take home with me. When I got home and baked it, I took a bite and it was peanut butter and apple jelly? I was confused. It was ok.  On my second trip to CPC, I had the cheeseburger pasty. That was pretty darn good! The meat was juicy and a little grease was dripping out of the pocket, which meant that it was nice and juicy!   Whenever I am tempted by a hot pocket, I make sure that I head to CPC for a well made, tasty, more sophisticated version!

There are few places that I make a decision to NEVER step foot into again. Yasu has earned this dubious distinction from me.   First, let me give you my background with sushi since this came into question from the manager himself. I have been eating sushi for about 11 years. Some really bad sushi, some amazing sushi. I have mentioned in previous reviews that I have had sushi fresh off a boat in Hawaii. While I don't claim to have had ALL the sushi in the world, I know what good sushi and what good sushi service is.   Second, let me tell you that I have had omakase (chef's menu) in several locales, so I know what it entails.   I was with a group of friends on my highly anticipated visit to Yasu Sushi Bistro. We had made a reservation and were seated immediately. We quickly decided to indulge in the omakase menu. We wanted the best that Yasu Sushi Bistro had to offer! I always say "Hit me with your best shot!"   Well... if you have nothing to do, and aren't hungry...you should do the omakase menu. It took Thirty Minutes between courses. And please don't think we were given platters full of food. This is more like 2 small oysters per person, A plate of 1 shrimp, a couple slices of King Claim, a dollop of Spanish mackerel tartar on a bone chip.... So think tiny gourmet food. So think how hungry and irritated I was Two HOURS later. In a 3.5 hour visit, we had consumed Four tiny dishes. I really tried to be patient, but this is absurd and unacceptable! I finally asked for the check as we wanted to leave and go eat elsewhere. I expressed my displeasure at the slowness of the meal.   Now before you Yasu lovers roll your eyes and shake your fingers at me. Let me put it in perspective. At ANY restaurant, it is unacceptable to be the first table to arrive, watch subsequent tables seated, and fed, and watch them leave and you're still waiting to be fed... you would be ticked off too. Now add to that a condescending manager who comes over to talk to you and asks if you have ever had an omakase experience before and tries to piss in your pocket and tell you that it's raining. Unacceptable. Now, add to that the restaurant sending out another dish after you had already asked for the check and then CHARGING you for that dish even though you said you didn't want the dish.   I have nothing against the food, though it wasn't very imaginative on the SUSHI level. What killed the entire visit was the slowness of the courses, the response of the management, and the lack of ethical treatment in regards to the check.   I will never visit Yasu Sushi again and I bet my stress level will be all the better for it.

I woke up from a nap and immediately turned to Mr. Hottie and demanded oysters. He raised a brow and I knew he was thinking "Great. What's this going to cost me??" So I hopped on Yelp to find reasonably priced oysters. I found Oyster Bar and read Su K's review regarding the place being a good deal and I was sold!      We hit the door dressed up for a fab night out. We arrived at Oyster Bar around 10pm. I ordered a glass of prosecco and we ordered a dozen oysters. Oyster Bar carries 3 kinds of oysters on any given night, so we mixed the variety up. Actually, I let Mr. Hottie mix things up and I sat back and sipped my beverage!      The oyster quality was great! Some of the oysters were fresh and briny, others were soft and buttery. The freshness of each oyster was without question! We also ordered the mussels. Now I'm not a huge fan of mussels and these didn't win me over. They were a tad overcooked in my opinion; still the broth was full of flavor.      We sat at the actual bar of the restaurant and our waiter was attentive and talkative. He was also preparing the food behind the bar! He kept checking on our food and making sure we had everything we needed.      Oyster Bar is one of the best bargains I have seen in a while in Vegas. A dozen oysters were 20 bones with all condiments included. Was this a fancy seafood restaurant? No. It's a casual place to stop in, have a drink and have some fresh oysters before heading out for the evening! I will definitely be back to visit!

I walked into Firebirds and realized that I had been to a Firebirds before at Arrowhead a few years ago. I immediately began to be nervous because I couldn't remember my last visit, which probably meant that I stuffed it down deep into my subconscious never to be discussed again. Possibly.  Our reservation was for 5:45pm, but I arrived early to have some drinks with friends. I was greeted by the hostess who was friendly enough. I informed her that I had arrived early to have some drinks at the bar before being seated for dinner. She found my reservation, noted that I was here and welcomed us.   We sat down at the bar and were immediately offered a drink. My friend and I were struck by the beautiful display of pineapple slices sitting in vodka. Very pretty and inspiring. We ordered their pineapple martinis. YUM! A little on the sweet side, but still very delicious and intoxicating. We sat and chatted for a while at the pretty bar. Our bartender was very friendly and unobtrusive. One thing that I did notice is that the hostesses were a little unprofessional. They were horsing around, giggling, and chatting loudly. A bit annoying, but they were young girls. After two of those yummy martinis, it was time for dinner.  Our party of 5 was seated at a round table in the center of the dining room. We were greeted by our server Brittany who took our drink orders and delivered water and lemons with speed. We informed her that we were there for the Phoenix Restaurant Week menu. She took the time to make recommendations off of the Restaurant Week menu and suggested wines to go with each of them.  Ahh my dinner...  I ordered the Espresso Rubbed Sirloin rare. The steak came with Potatoes Au Gratin. I was a little nervous ordering a sirloin steak because they tend to be a little tough due to the "cheapness" of the meat. I figured I was in a place that prides themselves on steaks and decided to give their "cheap" steak a shot. It's a good way to test a steakhouse. They should be able to make a shoe taste delicious.  When the meal was served, my rare (still moo'in) steak got served to someone else. So I sent my steak back for a rare one. I am SO glad that I sent it back for the steak I wanted. The steak was absolutely gorgeous and delicious. It was not tough at all! The rub that was on it was a little peppery for my taste but it's a personal preference for me. The Potatoes Au Gratin weren't good. They were a little too Velveeta for my taste. It would have been nice if they used some sharp cheddar or something like that instead. I ended up eating my friend's poblano mashed potatoes with my steak. Fantastic! The mashed potatoes were very spicy and went great with my savory steak! I hope they are a regular side. They're phenomenal! The dessert I chose was the Peaches and Cream Bread Pudding Cupcake with Bourbon White Chocolate Sauce. It seemed I chose the right dessert for the night because my other friends did not like the other choices for dessert at all. By the time I got my dessert, I was full, but the bites that I did take were delicious! It was a subtle peach flavor with a great sauce I wanted to eat the whole thing but my stomach just wouldn't do it. Brittany gladly wrapped everyones leftovers and put them in a to go bag. She was so quick and effiecient. Very impressive!  I am so glad I didn't dredge up any repressed memories of a horrible dining experience at Firebirds. In fact, the "mmm's and oooh's" that were being uttered were very familiar. It was nice getting reacquainted with such a great restaurant! I don't know why I didn't keep in touch, but I plan on going for regular visits from now on!

I just now got back from a group lunch at Havana Cafe. Terrible Visit.  Unbelievably SLOW  service (a TWO HOUR lunch? Are you serious?) and the food wasn't that great. I was really disappointed. I have been DYING to try Havana Cafe for a few weeks now and finally got my lunch buddies to go.  We arrived at the restaurant at 12:09pm which I know for certain because I received a text at that time. We were seated and we ordered our drinks. By the time our drinks came everyone was ready to order their meal. We waited almost an hour before the bread basket was plopped on our table. We were expecting our meals shortly after. Our food was served to us over 1 hour after our arrival.   I ordered the San Juan Combination plate that came with a little of everything. How do I say this nicely? Um, I don't think I will be ordering that again. The Pastele was old and dry. Usually when you cut into a tamal or pastele, it doesn't crumble or break. Mine did. The mofongo seemed like it was sat to dry out. It came out in two mounds and both mounds were greasy and dry (is that possible? yes.) The alcapurrias were tasty and tangy. Still a little greasy for my taste, but they were ok. I mean you can't wring out deep fried food. The tostones were not good. Again, something that was left to dry out. They were neither crispy nor edible. They were fried all to hell and I couldn't eat them. I took one bite of them and sat them aside. They made a lovely garnish though. The arroz con gandules was the highlight of the plate. The beans and rice were tender and tasty and the olives and capers gave the dish just enough zip. The masas de puerco fritas were greasy little chunks of pork that were ok once I dipped them in the mojo.   All of us were underwhelmed with our meals. Nothing spectacular nothing amazing, and everyone commented that things were cold, or greasy.  Next long wait, the check to be paid. We decided to split the check 6 ways. Easy right? Wrong. It took another 15 minutes to get that done. Just an FYI, parties of 6 or more get an automatic gratuity on their bill. The service was awful and I think 18% gratuity was very generous. We left at 2:08pm.  I don't know if I'm brave enough to give Havana Cafe a try again. I might go back to try their drinks. Usually a good amount of alcohol makes anything taste good so that might boost their rating up a bit.   I was really looking forward to Havana Cafe, but my friends and I agree that this place was disappointing.

So I'm driving home in my g-ride and my check engine light starts to flash and my car starts to shake and shudder like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang! "Oh flipping s*it!!!" I mutter as I find the closest auto parts shop.  For those who don't know, or who have always had nice cars to drive and never had any problems, if your check engine light goes on, you can go to Checker and ask them to use their diagnostic tool to find out why the light is on.   The guy that helped me (his name escapes me right now) plugged in the cord into my car, and ominously declared "Mis-fire on cylinder 1". Instead of unplugging the tool, and walking back inside to leave me scratching my head, he popped the hood, and showed me the areas that should be looked at, parts that should be replaced and how to be savvy if I actually need to take it to a mechanic. AWESOME. He saved me a ton of money.  Checker has been around forever, and they've never done me wrong. I recommend them for a do-it-yourself-er or for helpless people who have no clue why that check engine light is blinking so rudely!

I'm officially in love with Sol Y Sombra. I wasn't sure if I had room in my heart to love another tapas place, but turns out I'm shameless and can love many at one time.   My visit to Sol y Sombra was on a beautiful spring evening. Mr. Hottie and I decided to go out on a date. There was a nice breeze so we chose to sit outside. We were greeted by a server that was QUITE enthusiastic almost to the point of annoyance, but hey he was friendly and attentive.   We looked over the menu and I suggested that we order every single item on it. I was reigned in and made to pick out 6 dishes. We ordered the:  *Tortilla Espanola -amazing, I could have devoured the whole slice by myself.  *Brussels sprouts- I didn't like them. For some reason the cook must have gone crazy with the lemon. We sent them back.  *Chilled Asparagus w/Romanesco sauce- YUM! Big thick spears of asparagus covered with a creamy red sauce.  *Gambas a la plancha- LARGE shrimp with a garlic aioli. The shrimp were tender and juicy. Fantastic.  *Skirt steak ala plancha with romanesco sauce- tender, juicy nice char flavor and more of that glorious sauce.   We washed it all down with copious amounts of sangria and I was in heaven!   I will CERTAINLY return to Sol y Sombra again! It was a relaxing spot with great food and good service.

Mmm ACE, you are aces! You know a restaurant is good when you crave them MONTHS after visiting them. I had the chance to spend a wonderful day with my Foodie Bear and a friend. I don't normally venture into Mesa, but he convinced me to go to dinner with them at ACE. I'm SO glad I decided to go!  When you first walk in, you'll notice the place isn't much to look at. As most of you foodies know, never judge a book by its' cover! We were warmly greeted and we sat down to review the HUGE menu. They offer your run of the mill Pan Asian cuisine but then they offer various authentic dishes that will make you melt!  Since I had never been there before, and I will eat pretty much anything that doesn't eat me first, I allowed Foodie Bear to order the food! When the waitress came to the table he immediately ordered the baked pork chop. I don't know if she even got out her greeting. The Bear knows what the Bear wants! Apparently this dish takes a while to cook. We also picked the Peking pork ribs, I believe some orange chicken, and an order of fried rice. As an appetizer, I tried a spring roll.  I could see the boyish glee on FB's face while we waited a short time for our food to arrive so I knew I was in for a treat! The food started to arrive and we dug in. Oh my goodness the flavors! The baked pork chop was amazing. It really reminded me more of a simple Italian dish than an Asian one. The parallels between the two countries' cuisines were really highlighted in this dish. A nice tomato based sauce, tender pork chop over a bed of white rice. It was very well made! My favorite were the Peking short ribs. They had a semisweet glaze over a lightly battered, tendered piece of meat. Careful of the bones! Their fried rice was nice and smoky flavored, a sign of a seasoned wok. I didn't try the orange chicken as I was full to the top, but it smelled great!  I frequently think of my visit to ACE. I can't wait to return to try another one of their many dishes. I can't wait to find another craving!

This is the beginning of a beautiful relationship. I had the pleasure of visiting St. Francis with fellow Yelpita, Teresa F. We were searching for a place to eat after discovering that the Parlor was closed on Sundays. What a lucky find when we checked in on St. Francis!  I was immediately struck by the fantastic "open air" design of the restaurant. We were waited on by a very friendly, knowledgeable server who did not hesitate when asked about their offerings and daily specials.  We decided to start with the Baked goat cheese which came with tomato, walnut herb pesto and toasted. It was so tasty! It could easily fill up a person! I had to hold back on devouring the app so I could still have room for the main event!  For the main dish I chose the evening's fish special which was halibut with vegetables. I was so glad I went with the fish. It was so good. It was juicy and tender, with a flavorful pan seared crust. The vegetables that came with it weren't just an afterthought. In this case I had a green mixture that was fresh and complimented the fish perfectly. I was very impressed by my meal!  While St. Francis is a tad on the pricier end, it is affordable, accessible cuisine. I really look forward to my next visit. The food was fresh and flavorful. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I'd pray to that Saint!

Sylvia's is Meh... I really don't have much more to say about it.   From the walk up and order "service" to the salsa bar that children are allowed to play in... meh.  Now, it's not HORRIBLE it's just not the best Mexican I've had. My last trip I had the green chile enchiladas. The chile was not flavorful and I was left unimpressed with their rice and beans.   Maybe I need to go and order something of the grilled variety and give them another shot. Right now, I remain unimpressed by Sylvia and her Canasta.

Switch has really picked its game up in the past year or two.  I remember the days of eating at Switch and walking away from the place saying, "Yeah..that was just ok". They seem to have a new chef now, or they really took customer feedback into consideration.   I have been to Switch several times and have found new things on the menu to love. From the delicious and rich Lobster and Crab Puffs to the hearty and filling Apricot BBQ Feta Chicken sandwich. One of my favorite sandwiches is the Mozzarella Caprese Ciabatta. I usually add prosciutto to my sandwich and it makes it THAT much better. Try the sandwich with a side of Sun Dried Tomato Risotto; yum!  Sometimes they have some amazing specials. About a month ago, for brunch, I enjoyed the Chef's Special of Duck Hash. The hash was well made and flavorful. I felt lucky that I came in for a quick brunch that day. He's always thinking something delicious and "hangover friendly" on the weekends.   My latest crush is Apricot BBQ Feta Chicken Sandwich. "Oh, what's that?", you might ask. Well let me tell you, my friend. That's a sandwich comprised of warm, sliced chicken, a sweet apricot bbq sauce, sauteed spinach, sharp, tangy feta cheese, and a garnish of onion and cilantro (I usually skip the garnish due to personal taste). The sweet and tangy combo is AMAZING. I highly suggest  it.   You might, also, want to give their onion rings a try. I'm not a huge fan of onion rings, but Switch makes some darn good ones.   Did you think I wouldn't comment on their drinks? To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of Switch's drinks. I always have to upgrade my alcohol selection and ask for less syrup in order to avoid Hangover City. When I do order a beverage, I tend to go with a Drunken Italian Soda.   If you're looking for a nice lunch or dinner spot that isn't too hard on the pocket book, give Switch a try. Their affordable, and creative meals will make you make that Switch!

I won't write too much about this beautiful bar. This little bar is just gorgeous. I would suggest grabbing a glass of champagne, sitting out on their patio and just taking in all the beautiful scenery. The last time I was there, my date and I were lucky enough to have the patio to ourselves! Que Romantico! Dress to impress and enjoy!

Cute Cute Cute! I really like this little place! I'm a big fan of wine bars that are small and unpretentious. I attended the UYE organized by Trish and I was so happy I did! For dinner, I ordered the Caprese Panini that boasted a LARGE tomato, basil, and mozzarella. I asked to add prosciutto and they were very happy to oblige. Each and every person that I spoke to on the staff was friendly and conversational. I really like that. I will certainly visit Centro again! I would love to try some of their other paninis!

Every time I drive by this place, I get a little thrill down my spine. MMMM!  Where else can you go to experience a bit of heaven between two soft pieces of bread?  I met Mr. Hottie and Foodie Bear for lunch one afternoon at Los Reyes. I will say that I'm not a HUGE fan of sandwiches, but when it's free, what the heck? I walked in to the strip mall establishment and was met by the aroma of grilled onions and meat! So far, so good!  Once seated, I found my eyes wandering around the menu and wishing I could eat everything on it!  After sipping on a delicious horchata, and pondering the menu, I decided on the Torta el Rey which means "torta that has everything but the kitchen sink in it" (loosely translated)! This AMAZING sammie came with breaded thin beef steak, ham, chorizo, fried egg, cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and jalapeno! This is CERTAINLY not something you want to feed a family member who is at risk of kicking the bucket due to heart or kidney issues. Consider yourself warned. I will say that if you eat this sandwich, you are bound to fall in love with it. It's a dangerous, forbidden love, but a love you will cherish nonetheless.  One of the issues I have with sandwiches is the bread. In previous experience, the tortas that I ate had terribly boring bread, or bread that was way too hard. Los Reyes' bread was yummy! It was grilled and and crusty, but not so crusty that you cut your mouth or it's too hard. The ingredients of the torta were all well made and delicious. Everything was HOT where it needed to be and cold and fresh where that needed to be! Perfecto!  So why is that 5th star missing? I want to head back to try another torta to be sure of a 5 star rating!  Looking forward to it!

I won't write too much about this buffet. It got the job done as far as filling our tummies but it was nothing amazing. The only thing it had going for it was the mimosas and even those were meh...ok. Just expect your run of the mill cafeteria offerings and you won't be too disappointed.

I went to Sutra to attend the mixer where Yelp was being featured. After soaking in the cool "sceney" vibe, I decided that I was hungry. I asked the waitress for a menu. When she came back she told me that the right hand side of the menu was half off and made a couple suggestions. I love the names of the rolls that Sutra has. There were selections like "Cougar" and "30k millionaire". I had one of each. As if the rolls were made to live up to their namesakes, they didn't impress me; they merely annoyed me. The lack of freshness and flavor were the biggest factors in Sutra's failure. I ended up leaving plenty of sushi on my plate, but I was relieved that they were half off, otherwise I would have returned them upon first bite.   I would not eat at Sutra again if I had a choice. I would advise you to eat elsewhere and come to Sutra to see and be "scene"!

I always love being pleasantly surprised. I love driving to Scottsdale Airpark for Indian food, expecting nothing special (as to not get my hopes up) and being very pleasantly surprised.   Mr. Hottie was coming into town and I had Erin and Ayesha rounded up for dinner at another venue. Well, Mr. Hottie throws me a curve ball by texting me during a layover to state "I'm craving Indian food." I think to myself "Keep cool chica, sure you can find a good spot on last minute's notice!" So I hop on Yelp and try to find a good Indian joint that is NOT located in the East Valley. Yay! Indian Palace pops up on my search. Suh-weet! So I alert my girls of the venue change and off we go!   When we arrived at the strip mall location, and walked in, I noticed how big the place was! It reminded me of a big warehouse that was converted into a restaurant. I was also hit with the smell of spices and gravies which was actually impressive because this was on the eve of the complete loss of my sense of smell and taste due to a terrible cold.   The menu for dinner was quite large. I chose the Chicken Tikka Masala (my fave) while my dinner partners chose a few other dishes. Everything was delicious and made to order. I ordered my masala medium, while Ayesha ordered hers spicy and it seemed to come out as ordered. The one draw back that I had with this place is that they charge for rice to go with your meal, but we soon got over it and enjoyed our wonderful meal!   I returned with Ayesha on a Sunday to try their lunch buffet. It was very good and large! For about 12 bucks, you had a choice of about 10-15 dishes, rice, naan, and a drink (champagne was an option for Sunday). On that day there was a very large birthday party being seated and I think they sat about 30-40 people with more revelers coming in the door. So, the restaurant is no small cafe, for sure!   Indian Paradise is the place to go if you don't want to drive to Arizona's "Silicon Valley" (Chandler/Ahwatukee area). Their food is flavorful, and delicious. I look forward to trying them again very soon!

I'm basing this review of my visit on a first impression. Sometimes a first impression is all it takes. I met my friend Heather C for lunch at Digestif. We walked in and were greeted by a friendly hostess. Our server was at our table as soon as we were seated. He overheard me admiring their absinthe fountains and he ran to get me information on where to buy one just like theirs. I thought it was very nice of him. He then ran through their specials of the day. I nearly fainted when he stated that they had a foie gras burger topped with arugula to offer for lunch. I am A LOVER of foie gras. I immediately ordered it but asked for no arugula. The waiter stated that the chef offers baby spinach instead. Perfect. After a bit of wait, our food was served. Ah... what can I say my fellow foodies? The food was beautiful! I had to take several pictures of it for my food porn collection (see pic). I did away with the bun and ate the meat and the french fries. It was fabulous. The burger was a ground up flat iron steak and the foie gras was served on top of it with the baby spinach finishing off the creation. Fantastic, well cooked, and full of flavor.   If this is any indication of the quality of the food at Digestif, I will certainly become a devoted fan. It will be interesting to see if my next visit will be just as good if not better...we shall see!

Is it possible? Another 5 star review for a Sushi joint? Yes! Yes it is.   I was going to have dinner with my BFAM, Kevin and decided to look up Sushi. I chose Yen due to the great reviews and BOY was I glad that I did.  We were greeted and chose to sit at the sushi bar. I suggested to Kev that we go Chef's choice all the way. Of course my brother said "Hell yeah" to that! The Chef was mildly surprised at the request but quickly warmed up to the idea. If he was aiming to blow our socks off, he was dead on.  There is something about simply made, FRESH food that tends to wow me. He started us off with a sashimi plate to die for. It included salmon, yellowtail, tuna, and octopus. Amazing. Every slice was fresh, not even a hint of being old. The best way to describe the after taste is "Clean", no fishiness or weird after taste. The chef then presented us with thinly sliced striped bass with fresh wasabe. Amazing... amazing! The slices of bass were so thin, you could see the plate underneath. The next thing we ordered was eel. Now, I'm usually not a fan of eel because it seems gritty or greasy to me. When we were served the eel, I was surprised to find nothing of the sort on my plate. It was delicious! The eel was crisp and flaky from the broiling.   The entire meal was great from start to finish. I can't wait to visit Yen again.

My visit to this place was not only disappointing, but it made me sad to think that this place would probably go the way of Planet Hollywood in a year or two. I had the Carnitas and I had to cut (or should I say SAW) into it with a knife and fork. My friend's crab enchiladas were underwhelming. I was heartbroken that yet another famous Latino is slapping his name on a "brand" that will probably fail instead of actually checking out the food and making sure it's edible. Very beautiful decor, and nice (but not terribly sharp) staff is about the only thing I can say about this one.

I adore places that transport you to another locale without even driving too far!   One beautiful sunny afternoon, I asked a friend to have lunch with me at The Farm Kitchen. We only drove 5 minutes away from the office and we were on a farm at a picnic table enjoying a wonderful lunch.   The line had already started to form for the lunch at the Farm. We walked into a little building lined with racks of local product to peruse while you wait to get your order started. For my lunch I chose the turkey curry sandwich, a slice of pecan pie and a lemonade.   Everything was really tasty. I could have used more mayo on my sandwich, but that was a personal preference. The curry on the sandwich wasn't overpowering. It was wonderfully complimented by the sweet cranberries. The pecan pie was so good! My lunch pal left her dessert alone to dig into my pie! The lemonade was, lemonade. Not to sweet, not too tart.   The Farm Kitchen is a great place to step away from it all if only for a lunch hour. The food is good and well made, and the setting just can't be beat!

What a lovely surprise located in...well...Surprise! Mr. Hottie and I decided to have dinner somewhere different. The plan was left to me so I decided to head out to Surprise. I have heard some rumblings of a new bistro out there so I hopped on Yelp to look it up. I made a reservation for 8pm and headed out the door.   When we arrived we were immediately struck by the nice decor and cool music. We were greeted warmly and had to wait only a few moments to be seated. We got a nice dimly lit corner table, perfect. We surveyed the patrons, while the website does say the attire is casual, I wouldn't suggest coming in shorts and a t-shirt. Those who did, didn't look like they belonged. Maybe shorts and a polo? Maybe.   Anyway, onto our visit. Our hostess seated us and asked us if we had been there before. We responded no and she went on to thank us for our visit and welcome us to the bistro. What was cool about her greeting was that it wasn't like she was running through a script in her mind, it was actually a genuine welcome! No dead behind the eyes Scottsdale hostess here! Our waitress, Jessica was friendly and bubbly. She usually worked the lunch shift so she was a tad shaky on dinner service but we were forgiving. She was doing a great job and trying really hard to make sure we were happy.   We started out with a martini. Mr. Hottie had a "Stuffed Goose" which is Grey Goose with stuffed blue cheese olives. I had the Valentino, a pomegranate martini. We both enjoyed our cocktails. We also ordered a 2004 petit syrah to go with our dinner.   Ahh.. dinner. Let's start with the appetizer. (Tree hugger/PETA member beware)  We ordered the foie gras. The plate was very unceremoniously dropped onto our table by a food runner. She didn't even announce what the food was, just sort of plopped it in front of us and said "There ya go!". Not kidding. Oh well, a minor hiccup. While I was expecting a nice seared piece of duck liver, we got something more in the line of pate. It came with hunks of toast and a compote of apple and figs. It was still VERY delicious. Not as savory as a seared piece of liver, it was still very yummy and I will get it again.   We also shared a beet and goat cheese salad. I grew up thinking that I detested beets. They came out of a can, and they tasted like pennies. WRONG. I actually got coaxed into trying beets again and they were so yummy! The goat cheese with the beets were great! The bed of arugula was a little much for me, but that's a personal choice.    Mmm Dinner...We both ordered something from the Chef's entrees of the day. Don't be sad when you see the small dinner menu. The chef adds about 3-4 entrees onto that. Mr. Hottie ordered the thick cut pork chop topped with an apple and bacon mixture, and on the side was broccolini and curried cauliflower, talk about savory and spicy (not HOT but just full of flavor). The pork chop was perfectly cooked, if you like your pork chop well done. It wasn't too dry and the meat was moist and tender. The curried cauliflower was crisp and fresh, not at all mushy.  I had the duck breast with sticky rice, cabbage rolls and a slice of roasted pineapple on the bottom. It was DIVINE. The duck breast was juicy and delicious. All the flavors ran together in harmony. The cabbage rolls were just that, a small egg roll filled with cabbage. Sounds simple right? Wrong, the cabbage was so good. It was very well seasoned and the roll wasn't greasy at all. The ONLY thing I would have changed is that the ball of sticky rice was CRUNCHY on the outside. I don't know if that was the intention of the chef, but being a sticky rice/ any rice eater, it came off as though the rice had been left out to dry. Other than that, heaven.   We took our time with our dinner, sat, drank wine, and surveyed the area again. The chef had made an appearance at the table next to us. I understand that one of the gentlemen at at the table was from France and that is where the Chef is from. So she made a very friendly visit. As our dinner lulled and the restaurant emptied a bit, we were hoping the chef would stop by to say hello as she was blowing out candles around us, but she left us alone with our wine. Oh well, maybe next time I'll grab her. After all there was a lot of hand holding and goo goo eyes going on at our table. Maybe she didn't want to interrupt. We did get visits from the Chefs Hunky Husband who was very courteous, and the Hostess came by again to make sure our visit was going well. Talk about great service!   Vogue Bistro is a breath of fresh air in an area riddled with chain establishments. I suggest restaurant owners take notice and maybe form a restaurant row or something. Wouldn't that be cool! I have a feeling that Vogue Bistro will be on my list of places to go whenever I'm way out west. This place was fantastic and a must try!

Villalpando's is an ok place to have Mexican food. My lunch buddy and I go there often when we want a home cooked mexican meal. It's not spectacular, it's not bad. It's just ok. I usually get the green chile dinner. The meat is tender and it comes with rice, beans and 3 flour tortillas. My friend usually gets a chile relleno. She likes theirs because they aren't breaded and fried. So if you want simple, no frills, non-chain mexican food, hit up Villalpando's.

Pupusa. Say that word 5 times fast. Then go get one from Salvadoreno!   I am a big fan of Salvadoreno. Especially when it comes to their pupusas. Pupusas are cornmeal patties filled with meat and/or cheese, veggies, or even cactus flower. They are super delicious and filling to say the least.   I have had Salvadoreno create "mini pupusas" for several parties that I have hosted and they have been a HIT with my friends. I know a lot of my friends are now pupusa fans because of Salvadoreno! Try a pupusa with a side of crema...yes, it will change your life!  I have had a meal at their restaurant a few times as well and have not been disappointed once. The restaurant is more of a "quick meal" or cafe type of setting rather than a nice sit-down restaurant.   I will keep this review nice and short because how else can you say how delicious something is?  I look forward to more pupusas in my life!

Want to know how to wake this Diva Goddess up early on a Saturday morning? Tell her there's a Farmer's Market that sells delicious and fresh food! DING! I had the pleasure of visiting the OTFM with Mr. Hottie and my favorite Foodie Bear and what an adventure it was!! I won't write too terribly much about it, because how many reviews can you read about fresh produce and freshly baked goods? A highlight of my visit was the fresh mozzarella I bought from the Digestif booth. I watched it get freshly formed and was educated about where their ingredients come from. It was SO yummy! I also visited the Sweet Republic bus, and the McLendon Farms operation. WOW! I also got to meet a few fellow yelpers and share some yummy bread from their quest for fresh goods. I will certainly return to OTFM! (I heard a rumor that they will be moving the market into the underground parking area for the summer time) It was such a pleasure eating a meal made from the fresh ingredients purchased from local vendors!

I like Tuck Shop.  I like when you first walk up to the building, you feel like you're walking into a small day care center (note the building blocks out front). When you walk into the building, you're in a cozy space that reminds one of a hip and modern cabin feel. I've been to Tuck about 3 times now and each time I leave happy.  It starts with the host. There's nothing like being greeted like a regular when you've only been in once or twice. I love how friendly the Host, John, is. On my last visit, we had a group of 7 and we didn't have a reservation on a Saturday evening. John was more than accommodating. He invited us to sit at the bar while he made arrangements to get our rowdy (post beer festival) group in to eat.  The way I would describe the food at Tuck is "home cooked meals made fancy". There is a variety of things to try! If you are a vegetarian, some dishes can be made meatless, but not all. If you want something spicy and with a lot of kick, try the red beans and rice. I think that's my favorite dish so far. My least favorite is the chicken and waffle. The chicken was good, and flavorful, but the waffle wasn't interesting to me. I was wishing for some syrup or a cool sauce to go along with the dish. Tuck also offers small plates that are tapas-like. Go for the patatas bravas for a simple appetizer.   Tuck Shop is, in my opinion, a neighborhood jewel. It offers comforting dishes and great drinks, not to mention good service. I have made Tuck Shop one of my regular noshing spots!

Kobe hamburger with pretzel bread. That's all you need to know!   Yeah, I'm a fan! I visited Daily Dose on Whiskey Wednesday. That means $5 whiskeys. After one of those, I just had to eat something! Well, hello Kobe burger! I chose the Daily Dose burger which 8oz is topped with cheddar & jack, peppered bacon, fresh basil, shaved onion, tomato & harissa aioli on a toasted pretzel bun! Whew! The burger was tasty and the pretzel bun was a master stroke. The meat was juicy and cooked to order (medium for me). The toppings added to the flavor of the burger and the pretzel bun was chewy and salted just like a YUMMY pretzel. I was a happy girl!   I hope to visit Daily Dose for breakfast, maybe a lunch! I hope they can wow me like they did before!

2.5 stars   I have visited PastaBar twice now. Both times I have been left with the "Eh.. it's ok" opinion about it.   The first visit was during their opening week, I believe. When we walked in we were warmly greeted and seated immediately. I noticed the very stark decor and the nice big mirror they had to make the room look huge. We were seated in a corner booth that is not very comfortable for two people that want to sit next to each other, not across from each other (just a note). We took the time to look over a simple menu. They had just obtained their liquor license and our waiter was stumbling on the wine selection. While I understand that the liquor license is new, your knowledge of wine should not be. For such a nice place, the servers should have a slight knowledge of wine and be able to advise on them. When it came time to ordering our meal, our waiter was nice enough to advise us to order a side to split with our pasta if we were hungry. Good to know!   On my first trip, I ordered the Chitarra alla Carbonara. I enjoyed the dish, except for the fact that it was a tad salty and it had a lot of black pepper in it, personal taste is one thing, but when you're chewing into black pepper...woah. I couldn't even enjoy the flavor of the guanciale in the dish because of the pepper in the sauce. The pasta was very good, I like my pastas al dente and this pasta met my expectation. My date ordered the gnocchi. It was again just ok. On the side my date and I split the meatballs. I thought they were ok. The sauce wasn't your run of the mill spaghetti sauce. It had a smoky, almost barbecued flavor to it. It was good, but again a little crazy with the black pepper. At the end of that trip I was left with a "yeah....uh...I think it was good" and vowed to come back to render my final decision.   The second trip sealed the coffin for me. We were greeted and seated immediately, once again. I took the time to really check out the place. Oh! They put new artwork up....um... I will refer to the art as "Signs of the Apocalypse". Timothy McVeigh? Really? I found it tasteless, but to each his own. Knocked the restaurant down a notch for me, personally. We ordered the Fried Buffalo Mozz, Marinara "crudo" to start. Our waitress left us to take our time looking at the menu. I decided on Orecchiette with homemade sausage and greens. My friend and I shared the Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder. We noted that our appetizer was taking forever and when I spotted the waitress to ask her about it, she was delivering our dinner.... HUGE pet peeve. I gently said "You delivered our entrees before our appetizer." She stood looking astonished and said "OH! Yes I did!" and continued to stand as if she was lost. Well after we told her we still wanted the appetizer, she came back MUCH later with the incorrect appetizer, and offered to leave it and not charge us for it. NO. Wrong. If the customer ordered an appetizer, they wanted that one for a reason. Our appetizer finally made it as the dessert course of our dining experience, but that's not it folks! Rewind to our meals. My pasta was lukewarm at best. It was like I rewarmed leftover pasta and didn't warm it all the way and decided to eat it out of a Tupperware bowl. This was definitely not the marking of a 17 dollar bowl of pasta. By the time I was about 5 bites into my dish, it was cold. At this point, I was so irritated, I truly didn't care.   I know we're not in Scottsdale, but does that mean we need to sacrifice quality and service due to a different zip code? I know we're in America, but do we need to offend patrons with artwork of mass murderers while they're trying to eat? Again, to each his/her own, but I doubt I will visit PastaBar again. I'm sure it will thrive without a few people with discerning taste.   It's not a place I will crave, it's not a place that I would jump to visit again.

I love, love Scramble! I don't know what it is about the place! Is it the sleek and simple decor? Hmm, is it the friendly, attentive service? Is it the supa yum food? Perhaps all of the above make me a fan of this joint!   I so love Scramble ( Did I say that already?). On my first visit, I was with Mr. Hottie and we were Harley geared out . The staff didn't bat an eyelash at our rough appearances. They were warm and welcoming. I had the traditional eggs Benedict. I thought it was very good! I washed it down with a cup of coffee and was ready to tackle the rest of my day!   On my second visit I had the biscuits and gravy. WHAT a huge portion! I wasn't terribly impressed by the dish, however. I guess I expected a little more flavoring in the gravy, but overall, the dish was satisfying.   My third visit had me munching on the spicy and tasty chorizo and egg burro with extra avocado. Mmm... I couldn't eat the whole burro. I ate almost half of it and took the rest home.   Each time I visit Scramble I am impressed by the staff. There is a person on the floor at all times checking on people and making sure their food is ok. Considering this is a walk up and order type of place, it's a nice change to not be forgotten after you receive your food.   I know that Scramble will be a regular breakfast stop for me. It's nice to see such a great place take a chance on Sunnyslope. I think they'll come out winners!

This is my spot to get my nails and toes did on the regular! Pretty Nails is nestled in a strip mall close to Massage Envy, Chipotle, CVS AND Total Wine. So a trip to the nail salon makes for one GREAT afternoon/evening!  The inside of the place is small and clean, and very busy. It's owned by a husband and wife duo that keep the shop running smoothly. Upon signing in, one doesn't have to wait too terribly long before they're soaking in a pedicure tub and being rubbed down by the massage chair. The nail tech hands you a menu of services and you just pick what you would like done. Of course they try to up sell you on nail designs and all that, but just stay strong and they'll back off.  I also like the seeming cleanliness of the shop. I have watched the techs thoroughly clean the foot baths after a visit and everything seems to soak in some bacteria fighting solution. I do think that they're pricing is a little high, but the service and end result is worth it. For a fill of my overlays, a spa pedicure with design, I'm usually paying about $50-60.  I visit Pretty Nails every two weeks and I have yet to be disappointed by a thing yet!

This is for Marcella's Happy Hour!   I adore this super affordable and yummy Happy Hour! After breaking the bank with a day of shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square, I highly suggest you hit Happy Hour at Marcella's to feed your tummy and have a few drinks to soothe your buyer's remorse!   The first time I visited Marcella's was with Mr. Foodie Bear. We ordered a lot of different apps and I drank glasses of bubbly which were 2 dollars off. We ordered the melted Pecorino, the meatball, the calamari, and a pizza to share. The bill was less than 40 dollars with everything we devoured! My favorite app was the meatball. It was served in a small pot with a giant meatball that was soft but not mushy and VERY well seasoned.   The second time I attended Happy Hour, I brought my little sis and her bff along. Once again we were wowed by the drinks and the very tasty food. I tried the carpaccio this time around and it was once again good. We ordered another meatball because for some reason, the first one evaporated into thin air *ahem*. Ok it was inhaled by us!   I have yet to visit Marcella's for a full on dinner, but with such a nice and affordable Happy Hour, I haven't really needed to!

This. Is. My. Disneyland!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I simply ADORE Total Wine! It has everything in the adult beverage spectrum that I need! I can't walk into Total Wine and walk out with just one thing. Somehow, I find a NEED for that obscure bottle of Zin, or that AWESOME bottle of bubbly that I bought last time I was there...  I have always received GREAT service. I have even been challenged by a wine adviser to try a french version of Chardonnay because I STRONGLY DISLIKE (read HATE) Chardonnay.  He ended up changing my mind.  They offer ten cent wine tastings on weekends which is great if you're just browsing for a new wine to try! I have also met a Patron rep and a Moosehead rep on a weekend! It's a great opportunity to try new things, and get some coupons or drink recipes!  I also like Total Wine because it fits every budget! It's possible for you to land a decent $7 bottle of wine as well as a $70 bottle! They also have great holiday hours (they were open on Thanksgiving last year) that allowed me to pick up last minute hostess gifts!   I have never been wronged at Total Wine and hope they continue offering great deals and great value!

4.5 stars   Oh Tottie's. I think I love you because our names are similar... Beyond that, you have earned my love based on your DELICIOUS food and friendly service!   The first time I went to Tottie's it was for my Favorite Bear's birthday party. I arrived before Happy Hour ended and scored a Sake Bomber (or two?) before we were seated for dinner. I let the birthday boy handle all of the ordering. He knows what I like! I don't remember exactly what all we had but I do know that I want an IV drip of her curry sauce in my arm at all times. I also enjoyed her pork belly lettuce cups. Yep, PORK BELLY. It was so good!   The second visit I had, I ordered a duck with creamy curry noodle dish. It was not on the menu, and you're lucky if you can get it, but if you do, I wouldn't mind if you named your next child after me. You're welcome. The duck was tender and flavorful. The noodles were perfectly cooked with the most delicious creamy, spicy curry sauce. I could eat it every day. Seriously. During our meal, our server was friendly but a little absentminded. She also seemed like she was new because she wasn't terribly knowledgeable on the menu. At the end of my meal, Tottie asked me about my food and thanked me for coming in.   I am looking forward to my next visit to Tottie's The food is great, the servings are huge, the prices are reasonable. I know 5 stars from me is in their future!

This is based on my first visit to The Grind.   I am surprised at some of the low ratings because I had such a good experience. I met Chrissy P for an early dinner at The Grind one evening. I was struck by how narrow this place was. The booths were small and kind of uncomfortable in my opinion. We had arrived at the tail end of happy hour and our waitress was nice to put a couple of glasses of wine and bubbly in for us before the happy hour cutoff.   We started with the baked cheese with strawberry relish. I thought it was very tasty. The saltiness of the cheese was really good with sweet relish. For my entree I chose the special of the day which was the tenderloin sandwich with cream cheese. It was SO YUMMY. The tenderloin was well cooked and tender and the schmear of cream cheese was fantastic. We got talked in to dessert. We chose the salted caramel w/mini donuts. That's where they fell short for me. I was wondering where the salt was in the salted caramel. I think if they topped the caramel with a little Fleur de sel, it would have been fantastic.   I plan to visit The Grind again. I hope my good luck with the good food and service doesn't run out!

Let me first start this review by saying the following: Even though I'm a CenPho fan, I have spent many evenings in North Scottsdale establishments including Barcelona, Ocean Club, and Devil's Martini North with and without bottle service and reserved tables. So don't think this is a harsh review due to their location.   I was at Narcisse last night with a group of 6 at a reserved booth. Things went smoothly enough in seating us. I was immediately impressed by the decor of the place and excited to try their menu. My friend and I pored over the extensive bubbly list and the food menu quickly. My friend suggested that we get the chef's choice meats, cheeses platter. After a few questions, we went ahead with the platter and a bottle of sparkling rose'. Everything was great! The platter was large enough for everyone at the table to try something.   As the food part of the evening was wrapping up for our group, we decided to mix and mingle. The crowd made for some great people watching! I was enjoying the show! The music was good and upbeat and created a great vibe. My tootsies were hurting a bit so we decided to head back to the booth to chill for a bit. This is when it gets silly.   I was sitting in the booth with 3 other people and we were watching a bouncer and I assume a manager trying to arrange and rearrange a table and chairs right in front of our booth. I sat back in amusement at first as the Benny Hill theme song played in my head. I was thinking to myself "This table is blocking booth traffic." Well, the two employees decided to move the table a little further away from the booths and into the traffic that walks into the establishment; a very high traffic area. I shook my head and thought the show was over. No. A hostess with a clipboard comes over and says "Hi guys. I have had these booths reserved for, like, two weeks in advance and need to move you to that table. I'll give you a bottle of champagne for your inconvenience." I didn't object. I didn't say anything. I just got up and moved. Well, our booth was a booth for 6, the table was a booth for 4. So as we were trying to arrange for more chairs, if possible, I watched a server run into our makeshift table setting, look annoyed, then climb OVER two of the empty chairs at our table. Then I see another patron walk into the establishment, and slam right into one of the other chairs on the other side of the table. A bouncer comes over to tell us that we can't move tables before being told by another bouncer that we were ok. This table IS NOT supposed to be here. I felt like we were in the way and we were. On top of that, I'm watching as another makeshift "reserved" table is being arranged in the already cramped area. I had enough. I told my friend that I wanted to leave and started saying my goodbyes.   My friend had been a bar manager for a large establishment for many years, so he went to speak to the Manager to inform him of the tomfoolery with the tables. I walked up in the middle of the conversation and the Manager was asking us to stay and was apologizing profusely. I told him I respected the business and understood that things were crazy, but booting people out of a booth and putting them at a table that blocked the flow of traffic was hazardous and not professional at all. I also explained that we were paying customers that had bought approx 5 bottles of champagne and food, so we weren't schlumps. The Manager thanked me for my understanding and wanted to let me know that "after 10 or so, the place becomes more of a nightclub, so tables are tough and we're trying to accommodate everyone who wants a reserved table". Ok then they should pull all the tables then and not call themselves a Lounge. Or they should LIMIT the number of tables they reserve. He again asked us to stay and he'd get more chairs over and buy us a drink. I told him that the chairs weren't necessary (where the heck were they going to put them??) and that we would stay for the drink. He insisted on trying to move more chairs over, which caused more of a jam. We insisted that the chairs weren't needed and he took them away. Our drinks? Ordered but never delivered after 35 minutes. I just stood by observing and saw another server run into a chair at our table and pick it up and move it to another part of the place. I just laughed and told my friend we were outta there.   At what point is it a good business decision to sacrifice quality for quantity? Do you try to accommodate everyone who wants a table or limit the number and keep the service integrity high? Do you accommodate paying customers who are willing to continue drinking and eating or bump them for a table who bought one bottle of alcohol?   I think Narcisse has potential. It's not quite there yet. I guess I just expect more out of a bubble lounge. All the pieces are there! Maybe I will go back after they work out the kinks.

Ah, good ol' dependable Chipotle. I love Chipotle. Their carnitas bowl is the best! The shredded pork is tender, well seasoned and hot. Add that over a bed of white rice, top with red salsa (hot but not painful), sour cream, lettuce and guacamole and you have a recipe for a happy tummy!   Try Chipotle for a good, filling lunch, or dinner. You'll be happy you did!
