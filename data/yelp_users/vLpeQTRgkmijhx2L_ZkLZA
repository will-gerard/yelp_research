I'm not sure I can even adequately explain how amazing this place is...   I'll begin by saying I love Argentinian food - the mix of European and South American flavors makes me incredibly happy just thinking about it.  In fact, the only negative really is having to choose between delicious Argentinian beef or succulent seafood.  Do you want pasta or rice dish?  So many delicious choices... Ahhh.  Anyway, before I get too hungry thinking about it, this is definitely the best Argentinian I've ever had and one of the best places I've eaten in Vegas.

Luxor could use some updating and better lights in the guest rooms, yes, but it still holds a special place in my heart.    I have visited the Luxor Casino and resort space a few times, and stayed in the hotel last year.  Upon arrival, the desk agent was beyond helpful, and even upgraded the room since it was my birthday.  The room was clean, and had a great view of the Excalibur and Paris, nice big comfy beds, and a large bathroom - all you really need in Vegas.    Their pool is awesome (although it always seems to get cold whenever I go there), and the ambiance is equally great.  Also, I got engaged here, so you know... special place in my heart :)

I have a flight booked with US Air on June 6th.  I was excited to not be flying Delta or United.  Then TERROR struck.  No no, not that kind of terror.  Worse!  One bag allowance?  Are you joking!?  I was worried about how I'm going to move with only 2 bags.  Now I get ONE?  As if I wasn't anxious enough already, now I have to wait til the day of my flight and see if they have room for my extra bag - and then fork over my cold hard cash to get it there?  O geez!!  Inhaler please!
