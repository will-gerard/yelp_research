If I could give this hotel zero stars I would! We booked trough hotwire where it said it was 4 stars and in my opinion it looks like two. The exterior is deceiving , once you open the door to the room you get a motel type of accommodation!! And to make things worse there were ants crawling all over the bathroom sink , not one, many! We told the front desk and even though they were friendly they did not do anything about it, just called housekeeping. Horrible decoration from at least three decades ago, even the curtains are a nasty red fabric.  Save your money and go somewhere else.

Oh God!! The Filet! To die for I tell you!! Get it medium done with a side of potatoes gratin and Mac and cheese! A spread for a true carnivore who likes to indulge. I hear the lobster bisque is really good too but I don't like lobster ( I know right!) So if you're into that give it a try. For dessert the chocolate cake is truly decadent. The service is what you'd expect it to be, spotless. Very helpful, informative and nice staff in a welcoming ambiance. Last tip- get the pepper sauce on your filet, trust me it just takes it to another level.

Great pizza! Had the biancoverde and it was amazing ! The blend of cheeses is awesome and the arugula on the top is the kick you need to cut trough the richness of the ricotta. Great service , got a complimentary gelato and it was a really interesting nutmeg flavor, would have never thought of making such flavor in gelato, great call.  Also the establishment is quite charming.

Simplicity at its best, I have always had this thing for Scandinavian design and its clean lines.  I remember going to IKEA since I was about 12 maybe, so I kind of learned how to navigate one, its kind of a no-brainer once you get the hang of it ( they have short cuts people! ) so you don't have to go trough all their sections if you don't need it. My first college room was made up entirely from IKEA furniture so it hold a place in my heart. That and the fact that its really cheap!  Get a lingonberry drink please. Enjoy ;)

Delicious cupcakes! Right up there with the ones from Magnolia bakery in NYC.  The carrot one is moist and yummy.  Got a mini one for my puppy and he loved it! Almost ate it whole in one bite!

Excellent sushi!! Very fresh fish. Loved the carpaccios and the yellow fin spicy roll. Very friendly and attentive servers. For dessert we had the mochi which are great! The strawberry one is delicious!  Loved that they had champagne- elderflower cocktails, my current favorite!!

went there a few weeks aro ti celebrate muy husband's birthday. We had such a nice dinner! so delicious , I had never tasted a watermelon, beet and ricotta salad so good!  If you go , get the wine pairings for your dinner, totally worth it and will make the ocassion even more special. our server was really helpful and nice and even noticed some obnoxious girl who kept laughing to the top of her lungs next to us and suggested to turn up the music up a bit. ;)

Horrible!! Ordered a french 75 and it tasted of soured lemons, then tried a classic martini ,dirty, and it was pure olive juice nothing else!  Really gross, very bad we stumbled into this place because of all the stars it has, at least the cocktails were kind of cheap.
