Their original salsa is still my favorite salsa I've ever had. However, their service has gone drastically down hill in the last year to the point where the food just isn't worth the awful service.   In April, my family went for my parent's anniversary and it took over an hour to get our food after we ordered, 4 requests and 25 minutes to get a manager to come to our table, and when we finally got our food my enchiladas were crunchy and cold. We were given complimentary cards to return, and I wish I hadn't.   Every time I've been back since the service hasn't been much better. I was just in last week for my birthday and the hosting staff was horrendous. After putting our name in we were told 40 - 45 minutes. At the 45 minute mark we asked how close we were on the  list only to find out there were still 9 tables ahead of us.   However, my biggest issue came with the fact that we consistently watched people leave and tables empty up and no one was being sat. The 3 hostesses and what appeared to be a manager were all standing at the hostess line checking people in and wiping down menus. We tried to approach them and at first they just stared at us and when they finally acknowledged our existence all we got was attitude saying it was a Friday night and they were busy.   Half the restaurant was empty for over 25 minutes and the only reason we ended up getting a table after over an hour was because I ran to a seat yourself table in the bar area the second the people stood up. Our waiter was nice and the food was good, but the service we received leading up and the fact that we received no explanation or even sympathy from the hostess line as to why table after table was leaving and no one was being sat was ridiculous. Our server later told us they were clearing tables for a "large party", but in the entire time we were sitting there waiting, ordering, eating, paying and walking out the door...that "large party" never showed up.   I used to love Abuelo's, but I won't be going back anytime soon.

Horrible office! After suffering from unbearable allergies all my life I finally decided to find a solution and made an allergy drop appointment. My first appointment was great! They took me back right on time, did the testing, explained the program and set me up on a drop program the same day. The PA even took the time to tell me stories and testimonials for a completely unrelated jaw popping issue, and recommended a colleague in the area. I left feeling very optimistic and excited to finally be rid of my allergies. WIthin a couple months my symptoms had greatly decreased and I was excited for my follow up appointment for them to see my progress. Thats when things took a turn...  I made a 7am appointment so I wouldn't have to take any time off of work. I arrived right on time, and waited 15 minutes in the lobby before I was called back. Finally the MA came and got me and did the weighing, blood pressure, etc. and then apologized to me that the PA is very rarely on time and he should be here soon. I then sat in a room for 25 more minutes before he finally came in. He literally was in the room for 5 minutes - checked my breathing and nose and sent me on my way. Complete waste of time and I ended up late to work.  I then started having a small reaction to the drops and e-mailed my doc through the patient portal. It took 3 days to receive a response that just said "we forwarded to your doc" and then another 4 days before I received an actual response. Really makes me feel cared about.  I then reached out to the allergy drop company to find out if there was another provider in the area and I guess they contacted Warner Family Practice because I received a call and e-mail from the director of the practice. I was heading off for vacation so I responded to his e-mail and explained the situation. It has been over 2 weeks and he couldn't even be bothered to respond... and the worst part is they went back to the allergy drop company claiming that its ME that isn't responding....   I have cancelled all future appointments and will not be returning. The allergy drops are great, but not worth having to deal with an incompetent, rude practice that doesn't care about their patients.

My favorite yogurt place in Chandler! Great flavors and I joined their text club and get notifications of all their special deals. The owner works in the store a lot and he is always super friendly. Love supporting a local business!
