So, my fellow yelpers who love happy hours...I have discovered a new happy hour destination! Phoenix City Grill, which sports happy hour from 3pm-close. Yes, til close!!! Sweet baby Jesus, finally someone answered my wishes!   First off, the decor was lovely, as was the ambiance. Happy hour is only available in the bar area, where I quickly ventured to. Some of the happy hour items are: Beef sliders with yummy Tillamook cheese (whaddup Oregon!!!), grilled fish tacos, hummus, Green chile cheese dip, beef and chicken skewers, etc. All in all, a great selection with wonderful execution.   The liquor selection is also solid. Any bar that has items, such as Plum Vodka, gets a thumbs up in my book. The wine selection is also good.   PCG is right off the 51 and also closely located to my dive (yes, my personal dive) the Swizzle.   My only gripe: The bar area was serviced by one waiter - the bartender. So, being that he was making drinks for the restaurant side as well as serving the bar area, the service suffered. He was not nice, inattentive, and at times rude.   I was able to ignore him as the food made its way to my belly.

My ode to the Swizzle...  You would never think much of this place, looking at it from the outside, that's if you can even find it. It is tucked behind the drive through Starbucks.   The swizzle rocks! Flat out.   It is small and cozy. The drinks are stiff and cheap. The jukebox has great music to entertain yourself with. There is a pool table (which I have dominated). And no food. Yes..no food. This is a bar! And a dive at that.   They have the best women's bathroom (as voted by citysearch I believe).  All around, this place kept me sane for years and still does when I come back to visit. Be sure to speak with the regulars, as many of them have awesome stories.  A true gem.

Oooohhhh baby I loooove your way...everyday...yeeeaaaahhh.  I wanna be with you night and day....  Went back to the swizzle last night and fell in love again.  With pool. With dives. With football. With beer. With diversity. With the random atrium. With the jukebox. With life.  How can you beat pool and beer, combined with an awesome location, a diverse crowd, and a room full of people screaming at the TV because football is on? Then top that with the weird quirkiness that makes me warm and fuzzy on the inside...the atrium, a lovely bathroom and random bumper stickers at the bar.   The End.

A place with tons of character amidst the jungle of strip malls.  If you have not ventured to the Rokerij, it is time to do so quickly. I highly recommend going there for happy hour in the wine cellar like bar. Caution: be careful when you are trotting down the stairs, they are steep. Totally worth the risk though.  Once downstairs you are immediately greeted by the lovely fireplace as well as the lovely music and delightful smell that fills the air. During happy hour, all small plates are $5, which gives you the perfect opportunity to eat your way through various dishes.  The drinks are also lovely, and the wine list is superb. I highly recommend the brie toasts and  chile relleno. All dishes are full of flavor with a nice little kick to awaken the senses. Aside from happy hour, the brunch menu coupled with mimosas or bloody marys is the perfect hangover cure.  Ambiance: A Service: A Price: B+ Food: A+

I need to find a way to add glittery stars around this: YUM!!!! DELISH!!!!!   I recently ventured to Postino again, and it is probably the only place that I can fall in love with over and over again. Okay..a bit dramatic..but I take food seriously (if you couldn't tell).   The location and ambiance are perfect. The interior is decorated very tastefully and the selection of wine is proudly displayed. The patio is wonderful and relaxing.   I was there for lunch and ordered the half panini (prosciutto and brie) with a salad (raspberry chicken). The panini was stuffed full of fresh ingredients and perfectly crunchy. The salad was crispy, with delicious chicken and sweet/tart raspberry dressing.   The service was impeccable, while all along being super friendly. This seems to be a hard thing to find these days.   And on a sidenote...what makes Postino special is not their extravagant extensive menu, but the simplicity and thought that goes into every single ingredient. And these ingredients are of the highest grade and quality. You will not find a load of crap on your plate that you don't need or that kills the true flavors.   Heaven.   Or at least what I would like to eat there.

I have been to this tutti santi numerous times over the past 5 years. Last night we decided it was time to indulge once more.   We ordered the gnocchi as well as the daily special, lobster ravioli. I normally scarf a plate of gnocchi as they are handmade and delicious. Needless to say, I was scared to venture out my box.  The gnocchi were divine as usual...handmade daily, with the perfect mix of white sauce and bolognese. The lobster ravioli were delicious. Also, freshly made topped with an awesome vodka sauce. Furthermore, the lobster was so fresh, as if it was still swimming in the ocean.  To put the finishing touch on our wonderful dinner experience, our server brought over the signature shots of flaming sambuca, including the "three flies" (as they are called), symbolizing the past, present and future...If I had to predict the near future, I would say that we will be back soon.  Finally, our server was awesome and friendly. After all, you can't have a perfect dinner with shitty service.

So, I love happy hours. Beyond explanation. You can imagine my excitement to find out that happy hour is from 7 to close.   Needless to say, we ordered. A lot. Too much. BUT, in my defense...it was like impulse shopping - impulse dining.   Anyways.   I ordered a bloody mary, to get my tummy prepared for the onslaught of food that it was about to receive. Also, the artichoke dip, sliders and tacos.   Clock ticking.  Excitement fading.  Tummy growling.  Irritation growing.   Finally, the bloody mary arrives! Or should I say tomato juice. No celery salt, hot sauce, worcestershire sauce, ANYTHING. Except for a whole fucking celery tree that was engulfing the glass.   Boo hiss.   The rest I shall summarize:  Artichoke dip = large jar of mayo. Again no flavor.  Tacos = soaked in "sauce" (aka mayo)...couldn't taste much besides that.  Sliders = ok. Just ok. Meat reminded me of what I imagine wet dog food to taste like.   So, why the two stars you ask? Well..I added one star for the cheap drink prices during happy hour (stick to beer, maybe).   Now I shall find my giraffe and ride off in the sunset, in search of some good food.

I hate chains...and yes, I admit, we went here yesterday.  But you know what? Cheesecake is freakin solid. I've tried hating this place and decided to give up.  The five of us ventured here yesterday to indulge. We ordered the following: Ahi Tartare, Calamari, Chicken Marcel, Chicken Teriyaki, Salmon, Cobb Salad, Four Season Pizza, Bloody Mary, AND coffee/espresso... yes we were pigs.   My favorite is the Ahi Tartare. The Ahi is fresh and the dish is just perfect. I also tried the Calamari, and was very surprised. The seasoning was awesome, and the portion was great for us to share. A little on the greasy side, but still very good.  All of the entrees were awesome as well, with plenty of leftovers. And the salads are always yummy.   The service was solid as well.   Do I feel like a corporate chain loving whore? Yes. Is it ok to feel that way at times? Absolutely. My tummy agrees.

Nordies Rack should definitely be the first stop on your list. It makes sense to graze through here first, before paying full price for the same thing somewhere else.   The selection is good. It does vary though. So you can go here one weekend and find a grand selection of good, then come back the next weekend and find nothing. But I guess that is the case with most places, Ross and TJ Maxx included.   Rock and Republic/True Religion Jeans for 100 bucks, Naughty Monkey Sandals for 35 bucks, shirts, shoes, and couture. Speaking of couture...check out the designated, hidden area. Packed full with Dior, Chanel, Versace and so on. It is always lovely to dream.  I doubt that no matter how much money you have in the bank, that you would want to pass on saving a couple hundred bucks. After all, I think that is what makes shopping fun.

I love The Optical Shop of Aspen.   So, I had this obession with these specific Dior sunglasses, in purple with Swarovski crystals. Needless to say, I could not find them anywhere...but here! I was so stoked to find them.  I was happily inspecting my treasure, only to see a scratch on the frame. Lame lame lame. Well, the woman that was helping me jumped in and made sure to take care of it. Two calls later, she was having a new pair expedited from L.A. I was able to pick them up the next day.  Wow...now that is what I call service!  Overall, if you are looking for the newest and coolest styles for glasses and sunglasses, while all along receiving superior service, this is the place for you - without a doubt.  They also have awesome sales, so I like to swing by and see if I can find something at an awesome price.

Love love love this place.  Went in last night to have two pairs of my sunglasses adjusted. You know, how they get wobbly and slide off your nose? Well, Dawyne fixed both of my glasses while being super nice and friendly.   Love the service.    Now I can look at the ground again while walking without nearly having my sunglasses slide off my nose. :)

Ummm...can you say Diesel, Energie, Miss Sixty, Howe...all in one breath, or in ONE store for that matter???  Are those brands usually more expensive than a pair of jeans from Target? Yes! That is WHY it is a boutique! Hello? So...to break it down:  1. pay full price for name brand clothing 2. check out the sales 3. avoid the store all together.  Personally, I went with option 2. I love certain brands, NOT because of the brand, but because of the materials, design, and look. I absolutely would not pay 90 bucks for a t-shirt. 25 bucks for a unique designer t-shirt. Yes, please. Sign me up.  Aside from my rant (sorry), the store is located at the Kierland Commons. The decor is as unique as the clothes that are being sold. The staff is super friendly and helpful.   Two sweet ass shirts? 50 bucks total? Hell yes!

Yum yum yum...  Let's start off with the service...our server was awesome. We had to wait quite some time before being seated and were starving. So she brought us some bread and butter to hold us over.  We started off with some wings. They are absolutely delicious here. My suggestion is to request a mix of the honey sauce and the medium sauce. It is finger-licking good. Literally.  On to the pizza. It was really good. Nice thin crust, baked to perfect crispy perfection. The toppings were fresh, and the amount of sauce was great. I hate getting a thin crust pizza with too much sauce. Soggy thin crust is an oxymoron to me.   If you manage to have room, you HAVE to indulge in the baked cookie. You have the choice of peanut butter, macadamia nut or chocolate chip. OR you can do half and half. So worth the extra hour on the treadmill...  The only downside...the wait time can be long, especially on weekends. The upside to the downside, the servers do come by frequently to liquor you up and make the wait a little more bearable...

I usually try to stay away from the Arizona Mills mall. The mall itself has gotten crappier by the minute. Now, since I work close by, I was forced to go back to venture to Paradise Bakery. I honestly did not get my hopes up.  Since it was lunch time, it was not busy at all. Nothing is worse that being on your work lunch, starving, and standing in line. I opted for the Chicken Walnut Sandwich, with a cup of Tomato Soup.   The sandwich was delicious and fresh. The bread was perfect as was the chicken walnut salad. You know...sometimes chicken salad can get really gross..slimey..salty...yucky. This one was perfect and the walnuts added a delicious crunch.  On to the soup. First off, I L-O-V-E tomato soup. It is my favorite. Would almost consider taking a bath in it. Hehehe...well, ok maybe not. BUT this soup rocked my socks off. Perfectly creamy, with a hint of smoky flavor, a small drizzle of sour cream and a few crunchy tortilla strips. YUM.  So, venture there to try the soup but scurry fast and take the food with you. Don't eat there. Take it somewhere, where you can have a moment alone with the soup.   Finito.

Oh my God...Oh my God...I feel the heart attack coming...Ahhhh....and it is so worth it!!   This place has all of the tasty, greasy goodness one needs to complete a day, or week, or month for that matter. The Fry bread is made fresh and you can most certainly taste it. Again, it is definitely greasy, so if you are on a health trip, you may want to avoid this place. For the rest of us, who indulge, this is worth every pound.   The meat was cooked perfectly. The sour cream was abundantly present. The cheese was in all the right places (everywhere). And the fry bread was greasy, crunchy, and light all at the same time. Not sure how they pull it off, but they do.   I would suggest to go there for lunch for the following reasons:   -a wonderful break from work  -leaves you in a food coma, meaning that the rest of work with fly by  -it gives you the rest of the day to work the grease off  -just makes the day better!

When my birthday dinner rolled around, I could think if only one place to go: durants.   We arrive and the table is perfectly set. Our server seems nice and attempts to take our order. Problem is, we are way too sidetracked. She's patient though, for which I commend her.   We order a bottle of champagne and continue to munch on chilled veggies.   For starters we order a halfdozen oysters. Now, since living in Portland, I am terribly spoiled when it comes to oysters. They were good. Especially considering that we are in the desert.  For entrees we have the filet, ribeye, and prime rib.When the food came, my plate was missing in action.  Eh, whatever. They corrected it within about five minutes. Everything tasted delicious. The primerib is my favorite though - paired with garlic mashed potatoes and au jus to die for! Perfectly cooked and full of flavor. Yum!  To sum it up: delicious food with a gorgeous ambiance. Don't forget your wallet though. Not cheap.

I love sushi. I love happy hours.  This sushi was not good. Pretty much your "intro"rolls. You know the California Rolls, the rolls filled with cream cheese and topped with some sauce, and of course the fried rolls.  So, nothing against more "commercial" chains, but if you have to go that route, RA would be a much better option. Not to mention, they have a much better happy hour.  If you want good sushi, real sushi, go to Nobou or Roka Akor.  Sapporo = overpriced and yucky.

When I die, I would like to be buried with the Delux Burger, Fries (please don't forget the aioli) and a yummy IPA fresh from the tap.   The Delux Burger brings you a little closer to heaven. Cooked and seasoned to perfection. Topped with a guyere and blue cheese mixture, coupled with sauteed onions and arugula. All on a brioche bun. The ingredients are super fresh and the meat is all grain-fed. Mommy daddy this thing is a symphony in my mouth!   Then add this lovely burger into an equation of a massive beer list. Not your usual Crud Light but lovely Microbrews. AND good prices? AND they are open until 2am 7 days a week?!? Not to mention that the service was outstanding?  I'm floating on a cloud. Please don't get me down. The taste of Delux Burger and Sunbru is lingering in my mouth. What's that? I'm slipping! The Burger is weighing me down. Falling. NO! Back to reality. Damn.  I contemplated ordering another Burger to get that moment back...I guess I will have to come back tomorrow...

::slurp slurp::  Deliciousness.  Even if you never have the food here, the pineapple Stoli martini is indescribable. Hence, my description: slurp slurp. That's all one could hear. Ahhhh...  On a serious note, the Stoli Vodka is infused for weeks with pineapple, then iced, and...voila....the Pineapple Stoli Martini is ready. Sometimes, simplicity makes for the best cocktails. Sure you can jump through hoops and do a backflip (which would be entertaining), but it doesn't mean it is worth it for me to test my taste buds.  The food here is awesome as well. We had the truffle fries, clam chowder, chopped salad and the crab and lobster cakes. All were delicious!   A little less delicious? The prices. BUT...that is to be expected with some places, the Capital Grille being one of them.  The service was outstanding. It better be!  My meal of choice at the Capital Grille: two Pineapple Stoli Martinis and their bread. Sold and done. Next, please roll me outside, chauffeur me home and tuck me in! Thanks.

Steak and Crab? Yes, please.  For 15 bucks? Whhhhaaaaa? Hell yes!   These are questions my friend asked, when she wondered if I wanted to go to Bobby Qs the other night. Honestly, I did not get my hopes up, and prepared myself for a rough ride home. Yes, in case you are wondering, I have had some bad experiences with Seafood.  We decided to sit on the patio and were promptly attended to. I ordered a bloody mary, the rest beers. The bloody mary was freaking tasty. Spicy and tasty.   We all ended up ordering the Steak and Crab special. I ordered a Caesar to start with. The Caesar was good. Nothing amazing, but solid.  Then there came the Crab. Half a snow crab, with an 8oz Steak and a side of roasted corn. As I started drooling, my stomach did a backflip from excitement. The crab was awesome! Not chewy or fishy tasting. The steak was great as well, and the corn was nice and smokey.  The only negative...the server was a bit forgetful at times. Honestly, once the crab and I had our moment...I no longer cared..

If you are looking for Pizza Hut style pizza, this is not the place for you. This pizza will not be loaded with toppings, soaked by grease, or doughy.   Instead, it is a lovely thin crust pizza, fired to perfection in the wood-burning oven. It is topped with a variety of toppings..shrooms, pepperoni, melon, Caesar salad...you get the drift. The Caesar pizza is delicious and perfect on a hot summer day. Just filling enough, but not to the point where you'll need to roll out of there. Also great is the Artichoke and Portobello mushroom pizza. The pizza is perfectly covered with juuuust enough cheese. The mushrooms and artichokes are perfectly placed.   I think the pizza sauce is key. Hence the name I'm sure. :) Not too salty or acidic, but full of tomato flavor. No chunks, and nothing to get stuck in your teeth.   Definitely consider starting off with a salad, which is the perfect size for sharing.   Salad to share, two sodas, and a pizza - 20 bucks.

Thursday came and you know what that means! Boneless wings!!!!  We were serving and ready to devour a pound of wings each. The server comes to take our order. Some young dude who thinks he's way too cool, except for the fact that he's not. Whatever. I ignore it. Just give me mah beer and shot.   Drinks arrive. I'm happy.   Ten minutes pass. Where the fuck is Mr. Cool?  I want my wings!!!  Finally he decides to grace us with his presence and jokes. Takes our order. Go away now.   On to the wings. Delicious as usual. The vast array of sauces mixed with perfectly cooked wings. My only gripe? Why do I have to pay for ranch??? Whatevs. It's worth it!  Sidenote: This was the only sketchy experience I've had with a server here...hence the 4 stars.

Alright...as we all know the scene in Phoenix is horrible. So, due to lack of options, we are forced to go to places like Z Girl Club, formerly known as Mistys.  The sad thing is that Mistys/Z Girl club used to be a really fun place to go to. In the last two years or so, the place has honestly gone to crap.  Let's start with the music, since that is a key component to a nightclub, right? It sucks. Flat out sucks. My grandmother could play better music. They have played the same crap for years. Do you hear the newest stuff? No. Not even a chance. Even if you ask the DJ, there is a good chance it won't happen.  The drinks - a second key component. Same ol, same ol. No good drink specials, the good drinks are overpriced. And you have to pay cash. Meaning if you are like me and don't carry cash, you have to go to the ATM there and pay the effing terminal fee. Classy and cool. That's what I want to do when I'm out.  Now to the people that go there. It used to really be a good mix. Now, not so much. No style. There was a girl wearing Pj's. WTF?!?!?! Since when does Lesbian = scrubby and lazy? Stay in your living room if that's how you want to dress. Seriously. And the place does nothing to enforce a dress code.  Overall...Not worth the trip unless you are desperate...and I'm really sad to say that.   Boo hiss.

Complete desperation drove me back here one more time. I'm still hitting my head against the wall for going again.   The place flat out sucks. The music is lame and old. And while I did not see anyone wearing PJs, the "dress to impress" dress code, still leaves me with a BIG question mark.   It was actually super busy (because they were having a raffle for tickets to go to Dinah shore), which brought out some new faces. Considering that that is not the norm, I guess it was kind of exciting.   Overall, my face is sagging from pure disappointment...I almost tripped on my face on my sprint to my car.

Get. In. Mah. Belly!   Oh where to begin the ode to In and Out? How about the fact that the meat is fresh and the french fries are freshly cut? Oh, I missed you In and Out! And all the veggies are fresh too? AND the milkshakes are just flat out delish?   Be prepared for many people to share your space, as most likely they share the desire for these delicious burgers. For the same reason, there is usually a line. What is nice about all of this, is the fact that even though it is super busy, the service is still great! People are friendly, and the food is still fresh when you get it.   If you're looking for Chicken or Tofu, this is not the place.   And if you don't feel like going inside, consider the drive through. As you are patiently waiting, there is a massive window allowing you a front row view into the kitchen. Makes me feel a bit like a stalker, but surprisingly entertaining. You will feel as though you are waiting for your last meal on earth...but then again, it may as well be.

Bleh.  Most of us have ventured to the rock at some point in time. It has always been quite awful, but I had some hope after new ownership took over and renovated the place. It is always sad to see a place that has potential, be complete crap.  Upon walking in we were greeted by a small room used as a bar area, with random bar tables along the side. And whales. And scary looking people. And a DJ...well...kinda...he was playing music from a computer..you know...like you would so at home.  We ordered two beers and sat down. Why not give it a chance, right? Just when we thought that things couldn't get worse, we heard a sound. Like a squealing sound. Yes, you guess right, horrible karaoke ON A FRIDAY NIGHT!?!?! Why God, why?????  We chugged our beers and left.

Dirty Pretty is a fun place to go to, especially to listen to some live music. To be honest, I do not compare it to bars such as Suede, PCL, etc, because it is simply not the same.   Is the crowd similar? Yes. Younger, more Scottsdale-like. Yes. If you don't like that "vibe", I would suggest to stay away as you will most likely not be able to look past that. If you can look past the lame stereotype, I think you will have an awesome time.  The music is awesome. Live and loud, the way it should be. Last time I checked I like my live music loud. The drinks are solid and the service is awesome. The venue and decor is great as well. All around awesome place...  Venue - A Drinks - B+ Music- A Service - A Overall - A

Dear Roka Akor,   Is it ok if i just call you Roka? I feel that we are on a 'first-name' basis now. It was just recently, that I met you...but you came into my world like a whirlwind...i hope you can look past the fat rolls that are inevitably going to form.   Every meeting has been amazing, but the last time was unlike anything I've ever experienced.   It was Valentine's Day and you had a romantic evening planned for me. Even though I've had experiences with tasting menus (wink wink), yours was by far the best.   Butterfish Tataki with White Asparagus  Kumomoto Oyster with Yuzu  Sashimi Selection  Lobster Miso Soup with Wakame  Yuzu Marinated Black Cod w/ Robata Grilled Asparagus with Sweet Soy  Creekstone Prime Filet and Chili Ginger Sauce w/ Robata Grilled Mushrooms with Soy Garlic Butter  Japanese Wild Mushroom Risotto  Double Chocolate Ganache Cake   Everything was delicious. You even made me like mushrooms!   I was full, content and happy.   Then it happened - you wanted me to pay?! 79 bucks? AND I had to tip you? I thought I was special...that we had something!!!   It's ok though. You were worth every penny. And even though you make me feel a little dirty and very guilty, I can't wait to meet with you again.   Passionately,   Jana

Can somebody please give me a tongue scraper??? Quick! The taste (or lack thereof) of the crappy $9 bloody mary is piercing my tongue! One of the things that irks me the most, is when you go to a restaurant, spend ten dollars on a "signature" cocktail and it tastes like garbage.   In this case it tasted like water tomato juice, with a sprinkle of pepper. And a massive celery stick that engulfed the glass.   So you say, you should drink beer when you go to these places. You're right! But then don't put crappy drinks on the menu, just to fill up space.   All in all, we are in Scottsdale after all...there are a million places to go that have more to offer..    I left after the drink. You got me at "hello?" No, not so much.

So we had an hour to kill before our flight and decided fox grill looked like the best option. The last time we ate at the airport, it was an overpriced and underwhelming experience. So, we really didn't get our hopes up.   We order some beers, wings and a chicken Caesar. The beers were delicious (of course). The wings were surprisingly yummy. We got half BBQ and half buffalo. They were crispy and perfectly cooked. The chicken Caesar was also good. Overall we were both surprised.   For airport food, I give it a definite thumbs up. The service was a bit slow, but the beer made up for it.

All of us crave great live music at some point, right? If not...I feel there is something wrong with you. Yes, I can be judgemental at times.   Voce is a haven for amazing live music. The likes of George Benson, Marion Meadows and Rachel Eckroth frequent Voce.   From the outside, this place is very unassuming. It is located in a shopping center, right next to a bank. Yes, wtf is what I asked myself as well. Just outside, a lovely patio complete with a fountain welcomes you. Inside, the venue is perfect for live music. A small stage, nice decor and darkness with lights pointing to the stage....hmm...like waiting for a miracle to happen...  And it does.   The sounds of drums, bass and keyboards drown the talking and laughing from the crowd. I look around and see people swaying to the sounds, eyes closed, taking in the moment.   Yes, we are still in Arizona. And you have just landed at the best kept secret in the valley..   P.S. Minus one star for the restaurant side, as the service is sub-par and the food is not worth the money. The lounge side is almost like its own place..

This place is just so so rad. It was about time that AZ has a high end sneaker boutique.  The selection of sneakers as well as clothes is above all. No kidding. I bought a pair of limited edition Jordans as a gift here. All of the sneakers here a so unique and fun, and it really puts the fun in sneaker shopping again.   Sure, you can go to finish line and get a pair of sneakers there. And you will see various other people wearing the same ones. If you really want to find funky stuff to express yourself with, this is the place. AND to make it even better...they sell for retail! So markups? Not an issue.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out...

Ahhhh I love it when a great place forces me to get off my ass and write another review.   We were driving around and I had this unrelenting craving for fresh, delicious tacos...with a catch: not a chain restaurant and PLEASE not another fast food joint. So, I am combing through places on my yelp app when Habanero's pops up. How had I never come across this place and I live a mile away?!?!?!? Oh, and I forgot to mention, that this was on my last day in Arizona. Glorious. Secretly, I was hoping that this place would underwhelm me, just so I did not feel like an idiot for running to Taco Bell all those years.  We arrive and judging the place from the outside...well...I was underwhelmed and happy since my ego was still in place. Then we entered and I felt as though a permanent dunce cap plopped on my head. The menu looked delicious and my mouth was watering from the smell.  We ordered chips and salsa/guac, a fish taco, carne asada taco, blackened shrimp taco and calamari taco (the chips were $2.25 and each taco was $2.50). Everything was AMAZING. I would have a difficult time picking a favorite taco.   Please go and give this place a try...avoid the dunce cap.  MUST TRY: shrimp taco and carne asada taco MEH: chips (a little too thick for my taste) AVOID: nothing...try everything! Then run home to work it off. :)

APPPLLLEEEEE!!!!! I heart you. You are the best.   This is my version of shopping heaven. The buzzing people in their pretty blue shirts are my angels.   Clean.  Easy.  Fun (you can play with all the shiny objects).  Stress-less.    I think it is exactly that fun experience that always leaves me a few dollars lighter when i walk out. So, if you are not prepared to spend money on these wonderful gadgets, my best advice is to leave your wallet at home.

After a bit of time on my hands and a few friendly tips, I decided to give Alternative Medicine a try. The problem was...I had no idea what I should try! All I knew is that my back was hurting and my sinuses were driving me crazy. Sure, pain killers and allergy medication are fun to take, but why not give something else a try?  So, I contacted them to see what I should do. I had no idea that there were so many different treatments available! IV therapy, colon hydrotherapy (what the hell??? that does not sound comfortable...good thing i don't have a problem there), sugar hair removal, chemical peels, facials, physical manipulation, nutrient injections, and so many other things. I opted for the save bet...Acupuncture!   Once I arrived, I was immediately greeted and shortly thereafter Sanyee, the Acupuncturist, met with me. We spent at least 20 minutes talking about my various issues (I realized that there was a lot more going on that I thought) and possible sources. Throughout the entire session, Sanyee was extremely friendly, caring, attentive and calming.   Overall, the experience was awesome! They even emailed me the intake paperwork, so I could complete it at home as opposed to sitting in the waiting area.  I would definitely recommend ALETRIS to anyone (actually...I already have!)!

H&M and I have a long history...tracing back to my roots in Germany. H&M is super popular in Europe, so in the past I had to venture to L.A. to get my fix. I was stoked to hear that they were opening right across the street from me!   The clothes are solid. The one thing most people have to get used to are the sizes, as they are usually on the small side. So, either try it on or buy it a size bigger.   That brings me to the biggest downside of H&Ms, not just here but everyone I have been to. They are extremely busy (for good reason), so trying clothes on is really close to impossible. Unless you have the patience to stand in line for an hour.   To the clothes...you can find everything from accessories, to t-shirts, dress shirts, leggings, underwear and hats here. Literally everything. To me it H&M is like the IKEA of the furniture world, expect for the fact that the quality of H&M is much better.   Some examples of prices...t-shirts: $5.95, sweaters: $20, pants: $40-ish, accessories: under $15   So, save up your patience and do some yoga before you go, then put yourself in a bubble and shop away!

My thought: "someone rescue me from the rude, crazy behemoth lady!!!"  I guess I should start from the beginning. I am in a time crunch and starving, and remembered that Wendy's is usually pretty solid when it comes to burgers. I decide to go to the drive thru.  Lady: "HEEEELOOOO!!!" Me: :"umm..hi, I need just a minute" Lady: (heavy breathing and a grunt) "fine"  I'm pondering and decide on the Swiss Jr Bacon and 5pc Chicken nuggets and order.  Me: "Ma'am?" Lady: "YES" Me: "I would like the chicken nuggets and the Jr bacon swiss" Lady: "Next window"  Wow...I wonder what this broad looks like. My guess was something mean and ape-looking. I prepare to have the food thrown in my lap and arrive at the window. The lady just sticks her hand out of the window. I guess she want my debit card. I hand it to her. Nothing. She says nothing! Hands me the food. I ask if she had included Ranch (for my chicken nuggets). "No, I don't think so". Well CAN I EFFING HAVE SOME RANCH...Puhlease!!!?!  After all that, I wanted to take my chicken nuggets and burger and throw them in her face. It may have made her look better. Grrr...

Umm...W-T-F?!??!!!  Came here to grab some food and a drink. First of all, the place was dead and the decor/vision of the place seems all over the place. But whatever. We seat ourselves.  After about 15 minutes the server comes over and asked what we wanted to drink. And then tosses some menus on the table, while saying: "Sorry guys, we just opened. We don't have a fucking clue what's going on". Fine. Beers arrive. The menu did not look impressive. At all. I ordered fries and gravy. Not much you can mess up there right? WRONG. How about salt-less stale fries and gravy that tastes as if it crawled out of a can.  But this gets better... Server: Omg, did you guys see that guy? Me: What guy? Server: The one that was just arrested outside? Me: Excuse me?!? Server: Oh yeah! It was crazy...he walked in here with his penis hanging out. Me: WHAT????????? Server: Yeah, it was just hanging out. Me: Ummm...check please.  Bad food? Overpriced beer? And crazies? No thanks.

Zinburger = HANGOVER CURE!  Aside from that, the burgers are deeeeelicious and the ambiance is great as well. But let me start from the beginning..  I wake up to a pounding headache and not feeling too hot as a whole..you know, when the thought of eating breakfast (eggs especially) makes you want to lose it. So, when my friend invited me to venture to Zinburger, I was excited. Not about moving...but about burgers.   While en route to the restaurant, my friend calls and tells me that they have a Bacon infused vodka bloody mary and if she wanted me to order one. Ummm...YES???? Liquid bacon plus vodka in the form of a bloody mary? Mommy daddy...yay!!!!!!   I arrive to this delicious beverage screaming my name, a sunny spot on the patio and just a prefect/fun atmosphere. The bloody mary alone was to die for. I had to refrain from eating the glass...  On to the food..burgers...and lots of them. Not to forget the sweet potato fries and other yummies. The burgers were great. Maybe only us people, who are completely obsessed with burgers, can truly appreciate a good burger. Others should opt for McDonalds. I don't care what you say..you can taste the difference: the meat, the cheeses, the buns, the lettuce...everything.   Why the four stars? Because Delux still has the crown...

Yes, I know I shall be hated for this review, but that is a-ok with me.   So, we ventured to the place that is the talk of the town...well for the moment at least. It was time for happy hour and time for me to treat myself to a tasty strong beverage.  The layout of the place is awesome, especially with the stage in the middle and a bar right in front. It is immediately apparent, that we are surrounded by cougars and older men. Ok cool, at least the bartender in her hot little corset looked like she was our age...too bad that her attitude sucked to say the least and she had no clue what was going on. Aaaaanyways, back to this tasty beverage..  We order the strawberry kiwi martini, calamari, a Caesar salad, and quesadilla.   Ok ok, I know, what the hell was I thinking, ordering a strawberry kiwi martini if I wanted something strong. My fault, but it sounded delicious. Well, epic fail. Aside from the fact that there was ZERO alcohol in the drink, I was more overwhelmed by the exfoliating action my tongue was getting from all of the kiwi seeds. Yucky.  On to the food. Well...after waiting for a loooong time it finally arrived. The Caesar salad was tiny - and we ordered the full size. They should have brought me some chop sticks or even better tooth picks to eat it with, maybe then it would have filled a small crevice in my stomach. Then the calamari. Yes, I know we are in the desert, but come on...don't feed me some chewy crap drenched in buffalo sauce - even though the sauce was probably the best thing. The quesadilla was solid, but what can you fuck up there?  Overall, bleh. Nice try, but a definite fail. Not impressed with the service, the drinks, the food, or the servers to be honest.

G-Star? In Scottsdale? I LOVE LIFE!  So, for anyone that knows me, I've had a G-Star obession for years. Usually, this involved me emptying my pockets during strategically planned trips to cities that housed G-Star stores.   But first, I shall give those of you that don't know some background...  G-Star RAW (commonly called just G-Star) is a Dutch designer clothing company that produces fashionable urban clothing. It became a very popular clothing brand among students in Europe. The brand specializes in making RAW denim - an unwashed, untreated denim in which all jeans start out as after being constructed. G-Star is influenced by European fashion trends as well as by military clothing.  My personal description: AWESOME.  The style is unique and exciting. It does require you to think outside the box, which is not possible for many people. I like it that way. It keeps G-Star from turning into another Ed Hardy/Affliction/Insert.whatever.else.in.here obsession.
