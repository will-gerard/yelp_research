Placed an order for Delivery and the lady who took my order was very quick, friendly and efficient. She knew the answers to any questions I had and repeated my order back to me to confirm.   Delivery only took about 20-25 mins and the food was still hot when we got it. It was packaged great, they even wrapped the container with the sweet sauce for egg rolls in a separate baggie to prevent it from spilling.  There was a TON of food! If I had known that it would be such big portions I would not have ordered so much. The food was great too. I wouldn't necessarily say it was the best Chinese food I have had, but it was good. The Kung Pao Chicken had a good bite to it and the kids loved the Honey Chicken.   The only cons I could put down, not these are really cons, but it would have made the difference between the 4 stars I gave and the 5 would be that with the care that took with packaging, I would have expected they would put soy sauce and other condiments along with it. Also the Egg Rolls were not as good as I hoped they would be.  While we won't add Egg Rolls to our order next time, I will definitely order from here again!

I discovered the Coffee Cove after moving to Gilbert from Mesa. I love that it's right down the street from me, but I love even more that the people running the joint are sincerely nice people that want to serve good coffee!   I was so bored with the basics like Starbucks...For the same price range you can come to a place that maybe isn't the fanciest but where you will talk to some really nice people, get a really good cup of coffee made by someone who REALLY knows his coffee and how to prepare it, and feel like you did something to help out the small business population :)   Please go and visit Coffee Cove, you won't be sorry you did!

I will admit that after I placed my initial order with Sparkletts I came and read the reviews and was a little skeptical but after the initial delivery from Craig I felt better. He explained the process of delivery much more clearly than the website and was quite personable.   I received my first invoice and was concerned because it was A. a little hard to read and B. it was much higher than I had anticipated with charges I was not aware of (bottle deposit)  I made a mental note to contact CS to find out about it, but hadn't had a chance yet. Then two days ago I received a request for a survey on my service so far, I answered honestly that while I love the service I was concerned about my invoice and the hold time to get a hold of Customer Service.  Today I received a call from Sparkletts management based on my survey responses and they walked me through the invoicing process and apologized for a slight mistake on the cooler rental price, saying they had already credited my account for the difference...They alleviated my concern on the extra charges explaining it was a one time bottle deposit fee for each of the bottles of water I ordered - but that it is only for the initial bill and will not be an ongoing charge....and they apologized for not making it clearer in the initial order breakdown admitting it is something they are working on being clearer about.   He also mentioned that they are going through a slight technical issue while trying to move their call center, making for longer hold times right now.   Overall, while initially skeptical - this ONE call from the company helped alleviate all my concerns with my water delivery service. GREAT customer service Sparklett's.

Warning. Do not use this company. Here is my horror story.   I found a home that I was interested in renting and contacted the person renting it out from Gold Trust (Yan Mei Tu). She said in poor English that she was renting this for a friend of hers who lives in CA. I made arrangements to view the house and found it to be a good fit. At that time "Mary" (Her English name I guess?) emailed me the rental application and let me know what we needed to provide. Everything seemed good. We made plans to meet later that day to turn in our paperwork.  When we met, as  she was going through our paper work, she kept exclaiming about how I made more than my husband and how that "was not right" and that he should be making more than me....As if that wasn't insulting enough she started asking about our cleanliness and after showing her a picture of our dog who was laying on our bed (granted it was not made) she said if it was her renting the place as the owner she wouldn't rent to us because she can tell we aren't neat people. She said that she could tell because our furniture was "not very nice" and had the nerve to say that maybe we could have a yard sale to sell our stuff in order to buy nicer new stuff before we moved in.....AND THEN said but maybe the owner will overlook it because I make so much money. At that time I looked at my husband in shock and he said he was "ready to go" as was I. We picked up our applications, documents and 80 bucks for the fees and walked out.  Bummed we missed out on a good house, but SO GLAD we dodged a bullet in having to deal with these people. If I could give zero stars I would. The un-professionalism was astounding to me.

My two stars are solely for the comedian.  You get props for having great comedians in your establishment.  However other than that I am thoroughly unimpressed.   We were packed in like sardines (at least have the courtesy to give us seats far enough away from other patrons so that when one spits his drink out from laughing it doesn't spray all down my back), and it took until halfway through the show to even order food.   I get that there is a two drink minimum but I dont get how one drink has to be more expensive than my dinner. Seriously. My husband and I's dinner selection was less than our first drinks combined!    I think if you order food the two drink minimum should at least drop to one, and if you order a bottle of water and are forced to pay six dollars for it, you should have the choice of wether you want it to be "sparkling" or not.  I just paid six dollars for a bottle of water that makes my stomach hurt.   I will likely never return here. Luckily for me my all time favorite comedian, Demetri Martin,  was performing on the one night I chose to give this place a try. Otherwise I would have boycotted and given my review negative a thousand stars.

I have been meaning to try Dutch Bros. for some time and was excited when this location opened so close to my house. I hadn't stopped yet because the line of cars is always very long and I didn't want to have to wait forever for a cup of coffee that I wasn't sure I'd like having never been to a Dutch Bros. before.   I was pleasantly surprised to find that while I was in line a guy was running outside to all the cars to get orders ahead of time to cut down time we had to spend in line, when I told him I hadn't been there before he said he would run in to grab a paper menu. (He didn't end up bringing one but the line was moving so fast that by the time he came back out I was already at the menu at the drive through)  I ordered the Caramelizer with an extra shot. The extra shot balanced out the sweetness otherwise I think it might have been just a tad too sweet, next time I'll just order it with one less pump of flavor or something.   The lady that took my order at the window was very friendly and when I mentioned that I had never been there before she gave me a stamp card that was fully stamped with the exception of one stamp and a bunch of coupons.   I will absolutely be returning here. The coffee and service was delightful, not to mention the icing on the cake - my coffee with an extra shot was still about a dollar less than the usual coffee I get from Starbucks!
