A large group (about 12) and I recently had a graduation celebration dinner here. Let me just preface this by saying that I had a TON of requests for the staff to accommodate before I even stepped into the restaurant. As the girlfriend of the graduate, I had brought a cake from home that unfortunately was falling apart on my way over the restaurant. I called in, a little frantically, and the staff was very helpful in agreeing to take the cake from me, making sure it stayed together, placing it in the freezer briefly, then the fridge, putting on the candles I had also brought from home, and then bringing out a small team of servers to present the cake to my very ecstatic boyfriend. When I arrived, the hostess still opened the door for me, even with my very heavy cake in one hand. Love love love it.  Our group had called in to make a reservation for 20, but 7 or 8 didn't show. The restaurant was very forgiving of this and made sure to bring our food quickly once we told them we were ready to order. The bread and olive oil dip was DELICIOUS. I had to stop myself to save room for my salad and main dish. I had the Pasta Carraba, which was not the absolute best fettucini alfredo I've ever had, but it was good. I will say that some of the other dishes seemed a bit pricey, but I had leftovers, so I would say my dish was priced about right. The atmosphere was also lovely, with great music choice playing in the background.  Overall, it is truly the service here that earns this Carraba's its stars. Thanks to the wonderful staff at this location, my evening went smoothly and the entire group had a fantastic time.

This was the most expensively terrible pizza we've ever had. The sauce drowned out the cheese because most of it was on TOP of the toppings. It looked like someone threw up sauce over everything.  And speaking of the sauce, three words: SALTY, SALTY, SALTY. Like seriously. Even the crust was incredibly salty. Couldn't even finish a single slice, it was so disgusting.  We have never been picky about pizza, but wow were we disappointed in the quality of this food.

I've passed by this place quite a few times while going to ASU and never thought much of it -- that is, up until last night, when a potential design client of mine wanted to meet up the next afternoon to discuss creating a business card for her... And I had no business cards of my own to share! Looks pretty bad, right? Well, after hours of struggling with my own printer, I finally gave up and decided to call in the professionals. FedEx Office was nice enough, but they said they charge around $20 for 100 B&W one-sided cards. Well that's all fine and dandy, but I needed a much smaller amount and my cards were designed to be double-sided, full color.  I remembered The Alternative last minute and called them up this morning. The staff member who answered (Kim, I believe) was friendly and very helpful. Through e-mails we set up all the details and she had my cards printed in an hour for about a dollar a sheet. The paper is good quality and the cards look great! I will definitely be using The Alternative again. The interior of the place looks hip and fun, and I wouldn't mind hanging out there waiting for some printing jobs to be done. Definitely check them out if you need great printing services in Tempe!

Okay, I cannot say enough good things about this place. Yum. Yum yum yum yum YUM! This is hands-down the BEST Italian restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of eating at. I went for a celebratory dinner with my boyfriend after one year together and the atmosphere in the dining room was just lovely. Very romantic.  Now on to my favorite part: the food. My guy had the Penne Sicilian, which was good, but not really something to rave about. I had the Gnocchi alla Vodka, a, and I quote, "homemade potato gnocchi in a pink vodka sauce with shallots, fresh tomatoes and a touch of cream". Absolutely heavenly. I scraped all the sauce off my plate just to be able to taste how wonderful it was until the very end. The homemade gnocchi was exactly the right texture and the whole dish just worked together so wonderfully. You need to try this. You deserve to try this! I dream about dishes like this one, seriously.  The dessert was also fantastic. We split a raspberry tartufo (we were so stuffed from the huge portions of pasta) and it was a great finish to the dinner. The final bill wasn't ridiculous, especially for the quality of the food (on my end, at least) and the atmosphere. I thought it was very reasonable and will definitely be looking forward to my next visit there soon.

I called in for an anti-frizz treatment (Kerastase Discipline product line) last minute on a Sunday. They got me in right away and Teresa was amazing throughout everything. She took the time to walk me through everything, including my billions of questions about what was going on with my hair and why it was frizzing. She even explained the basics behind how scalp and hair care was different and why.   Her treatment application included a neck massage which was HEAVENLY. Honestly, Teresa, if you're reading this, you need to think about being a masseuse on the side.   After the treatment, she walked me through what my daily routine should be and messed up her own hair to demonstrate how I should blow dry mine. She put her recommended products on the counter and then walked away so I didn't feel pressured to buy. Teresa told me to call her anytime if I had anymore questions.  Absolutely fabulous service and I will definitely give then a try next time I need a haircut. A++

Chill is amazing! I have recently become very lactose-intolerant and I miss grabbing fro-yo and gelato with my friends. Then I found Chill through a WeeklyPlus deal, and all I can say is WOW. They have the most non-dairy options I have ever seen at a gelato/froyo place, period! My favorites are spumoni and mango. Oh, mango. As silly as it sounds, Chill has the hands-down mango-iest mango gelato I have ever tasted. So delicious!   The guy who owns the place is very friendly and you can try as many flavors as you like -- which is great if you're super indecisive like me. They have free WiFi and plenty of outlets for hanging out while you're enjoying your delicious treats. I will definitely be back here regularly. Can't wait to try the soy soft-serve!

This is our favorite Pho place in the area. It's never too busy, but never too empty where you feel awkward eating "alone". There is this one lovely hostess who always takes orders and seats customers who we simply adore. She remembers us and our typical orders even though we've only been there maybe 4 or 5 times. She even served my mom a free appetizer and iced tea for her birthday today! I would have to say she is one of the reasons we keep coming back.  The other reason would be the "un-pho-gettable" pho! The bowls are huge! (Even the normal size.) We always leave with leftovers without having to empty our wallets. The prices are very affordable and we love the flavor of their pho. And if you're looking for a great appetizer, try their fried calamari! Simply delish!  The only reason this place misses the 5-star mark is because I don't think some of the waiters/waitresses that bring out the food speak English very well, or aren't very sociable, at least. We had some difficulty communicating that we wanted an extra plate and bowl. Also, their "specials" aren't anything special in particular. At least the ones I've had (beef low mein & sweet and sour chicken). They taste pretty much like any typical Chinese restaurant.  So if you're in Chandler, give them a try, but have the Pho. That will make your trip definitely worth it.

I work for an SAT prep company, so I'm always coming here to drop off exam forms that need to be mailed. I don't pay for the shipping, so I'm not rating on the prices here (although I did try to get business cards printed once and thought they were kind of expensive).  No, this review is mainly for my experience there today with one particular employee: Tom (I hope I'm remembering his name right). He was friendly, attentive, helpful, and even did a good job with upselling, I will admit. For anyone who's ever worked in retail, I'm sure you know how important it is to try and "add on" to a customer's purchase. This FedEx  location should be proud of Tom's dedication and work ethic.  When I brought Tom a whole pack of loose-leaf answer sheets, he happily took them from me, rubber-banded them, packed them nicely in a box, taped it up, and got my package on it's way in no time. Excellent service - I was very pleased with my visit today. This employee definitely deserves a raise or some other type of reward for how well he does his job.

I've only ever been here for lunch during the work week and they're never really that busy, but the service is always slow and sporadic. Our group got our meals like 20 minutes apart and most of us had salads. The server made a snarky comment to one of us when she forgot who ordered what dish and we corrected her. She also never came around after we got our food and refilled our water.   All in all, service was meh, food was ok. The pizza and breadsticks are good, but the salad is always drowning in dressing and soggy.

Fun atmosphere and the food was great, thanks to the Yelper recommendations! Mexican street corn is fantastic, I loved the vegetarian pinto beans, and the crispy fish tacos are awesome! My friend and I split an appetizer, 4 tacos, and a side of pinto beans. It came out to about $12. Worth a try for sure!

The chicken gyro was DELICIOUS. Seriously so good, I wish I lived close to this place for that alone. Hummus was also fantastic, but I wanted more than one pita, so next time I'll ask for extra. Baklava was ok, kind of a small serving. Free Turkish tea with check-in, which was good also! All-in-all, about $20-25 for 2 chicken gyros, hummus appetizer, and one piece of baklava.

I wasn't expecting that much from a food truck smoothie, but this thing blew me away! I had the Kale Me Crazy (minus the mint) and it was absolutely delicious. The consistency was perfect and the flavor outstanding without being too sweet, especially for something kale-based (not a kale fan personally).  The guy standing outside the truck was friendly and very helpful when I needed suggestions based on dietary restrictions. Price was $5 for what I would call a medium sized, organic smoothie -- very reasonable.   I wish I lived closer so I could drink this stuff more often. Instead I'm just going to have to settle for slaving over my Nutribullet trying to figure out how to replicate this recipe at home.

I wasn't expecting much from a small indoor course, to be honest, but I actually had a blast! Each hole has some fun quirk to it and the blackout effects are pretty neat. We definitely enjoyed ourselves. The only downside is most Friday/Saturday nights are packed and going through the course involves a lot of waiting, but I thought the manager did a great job of splitting big parties and staggering teams to make the experience better.  I will definitely return!
