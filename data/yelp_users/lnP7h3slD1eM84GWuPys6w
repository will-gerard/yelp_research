Was it cause I'm a girl? Hope not.  I'm always hesitant to get automotive stuff done on my own. I'd like to think that taking advantage of the ladies and their car troubles is a thing of the past, but after my experience here, I can't help but think otherwise.   Literally within minutes of walking in to seek help on a single tire that was losing air, I was told everything that was wrong with all of my other tires, and that I was going to need a new set if I didn't want to risk a blowout, AND that it was going to cost me $400+ to do it.   Ok, fine. Appreciate the tip. But can you take my car into the garage and at least look it over first? I prefer to do my research, and am already a little distrusting considering it only took seconds to be told that I was going to need to spend tons more than what I walked in intending. And maybe it's true that I did need new tires, but I think there's an art to sales and service, and this sir most certainly did not have it.   So, I told him I would think about it, but that I would like the tire I came in for fixed to ensure safety in the meantime. After an hour and a half  of waiting across the street, I came back to a car that had yet to be seen. I complain, they take it back. Tell me it cannot be repaired and that for whatever reason they can't even put my donut on (something about my brakes being too big?) Sounded bogus to me, but regardless, I left over 2 hours later in the same predicament as I arrived. Maybe worse, because I was so highly disturbed and disappointed by my dealings here. I guess maybe if I had blindly agreed to purchase anything they asked of me as soon as I arrived they would of been a little nicer? Happy to say I bought a new set somewhere so much better. No more "Discount" Tire for me.

Walked in a virgin laser-er, Walked out as Lara Croft (Or so I thought)  Had so much fun running around in the dark. Went with a bunch of kiddies for a birthday. Didn't book a package, but did the unlimited gaming from 8-Midnight for $19.99 which ended up being a pretty good deal considering we played back to back the entire time. Games typically last about 20 min. at $8 a piece, so I would say unlimited is the best way to go.  Initially I thought I would just hang out and kill time in the nice lil' snack-bar/arcade area, but in the end I was glad I opted to play. The game proved to be quite an enjoyable work out, but you can also find joy in taking it easy in a dark hidden corner and shooting secretly from there, if you so choose. Either way, you can't go wrong with this place. My favorite part was the final play of the night in which we had a free for all. Every man for himself. It's the best way to play in my opinion and the guy even let the game run on a tad bit longer, which I thought was mighty cool of him.   Definitely consider this place for an out of the norm night-o-fun, but be sure to check the website for specials first as it seems they have quite a few throughout the week.

If you're looking for something fun and out of the norm to do on a Friday night or perhaps like me, hoping to one day join the cast of DWTS, this is the place to go. For only $7 you get to learn a new dance, snack on a few hor dourves, and mingle with the pros til the midnight hour.   You don't need to have a partner to participate and the dances being taught vary from week to week, so there's always room to learn something new (just check the calendar online). The first hour is devoted to step by step instruction for beginners, then intermediate, followed by a free for all boogie for the remainder of the night.   I've gone several times now and the room is always full of pretty much every type of person and skill level you could think of (believe you me, that is not an exaggeration) There really is a spot for any and every one here including you, so do yourself a favor and give it a go!

I love the feeling I get when I walk into Aj's, but I don't love the feeling of emptiness in my pockets as I walk out.   I'm a sucker for their bakery, and of course that's the first thing I see every time I walk in. Fresh flaky pastries, scrumptious pumpkin goodies (the cheesecake, my goodness!) and a plethora of beautiful handcrafted chocolate delights. Who can resist?   Not I.   And that's the reason I never shop here, UNLESS I'm specifically looking for baked goodies. I love to come here and buy fancy things that will make those that I love happy or find that rare fancy cheese that nobody else seems to carry, but when it comes to day-to-day grocery shopping, I'm doing it FRY'S VIP style.

S'more Pizzokie, Nuff Said!   I mean.. I wish that was all there was to say. I'm lucky to have friends that love dessert, so we met there late night with a purpose. And that was to devour these delicious cookies we'd heard so many delightful things about. Delightful they were (albeit a bit smaller compared to others) but they were indeed delicious. The problem, however, had everything to do with our experience outside of dessert.   The service was slow, and minimal at best. We waited quite a while to get seated in a nearly empty restaurant, only to eventually seat ourselves. We then waited some more before somebody finally took notice to help us. And then waited some more (a ton more) for them to take our order and eventually bring our food. We realized that during the wait happy hour had kicked in, so we ordered a few more things. BIG mistake. Big wait for a big let down.  Just an underwhelming experience all around, and our server was grumpy to boot. Not happy that I recommended this place, and it's highly unlikely that I ever would again.

Best. Wings. Ever.  I think they're fried and then grilled? I don't know. I just know they're ridiculously good. I'm a picky wing eater. I like them cooked a very specific way and that's how they make them, and it's probably why they win awards. Also, they allow me to order all flats, which makes me extra happy. If you're a chicken wing lover, you've probably already tried this place. If not, you ought to. Immediately.

It had been quite some time since her last Fuddruckers feast (8 years maybe?) Butta free birthday burger along with a newly featured menu brought her back and she loved every scrumptious second.  Everything was made to order just the way she liked, which was just right for a picky patty like her. She was able to order any type of meat she wanted (buffalo, elk and boar even), any size (big or realllly big), cooked any way she wished, and then given free rein to top it off in a variety of ways at the best condiment bar around. MELTED CHEESE PLEASE! If that wasn't enough, she was offered one the creamiest chocolatiest shakes in all the land to go alongside it. She opted instead to try her hand at the robotic soda machine that hosted some 42,000 different flavors which despite sounding delicious, never seemed to live up to the originals. Still, she had a grand ol' time and her hamburgered heart skipped (okay waddled) out one very happy camper.

Lux is my lover. This is one of the few places I've found that really helps me get into the "zone" come crunch time, which is surprising considering all of the people watching, tasty dining (bacon jalapeno macaroni please!) and delightful tunes it offers its visitors.  Yes it gets crowded, but I've never not been able to find a seat, as there are plenty to be had inside and out. The ambiance is amazing and might almost make you forget where you are from time to time. I've literally spent an entire day here on more than one occasion without even realizing. I'll refrain from saying just how many times so as to avoid potentially being charged rent, but the answer is a lot. It's that cozy.  Come here if you want to warm up with some chai, plug something in, absorb productivity juices, or just plain enjoy life. 'Tis a swell place.

MBB is one of those places that I really like, but can't really explain why. Maybe it's the fresh jam, the perfectly cooked bacon, the cute old fashioned style of the place or  the fact that you tell yourself it just has to be great if everyone else is willing to wait in the desert for up to an hour-ish to have their hand at some..I dunno.   It is indeed tasty, and I've yet to try anything that disappoints, but the menu (in my humble o-pinion) doesn't really offer anything extraordinarily fantastic enough to warrant the wait. That said, if ever I drive by the place in the a.m. hours and happen to see that there's no line, I will consider it my lucky day and likely mosey on in.

Avett Brothers in an intimate venue under the starry night sky on a cool winter night=perfection.   It's a small enough setting that you can see superbly from anywhere you stand, but with enough room to spread out on the grass if you so choose. If you score a spot right up front and find yourself wanting a beer without losing said spot, worry not. Beer, nachos and freshly popped kettle corn will find you.   Parking was simple enough and the prices were right when compared to most. The pat down was a bit of a pain with having just one girl vs. 3 guys avail to do it, and they've got some pretty strict requirements in terms of what you can bring in, but all in all,  great place to see your faves play!

If I did it, you can do it! (Blah, blah, blah)  Okay, but really....I'm not one of those cool people that hikes as a hobbie, or ever, but I did manage to make my way to the top of this mountain to behold the magnificent view that everyone boasts about, and I'm damn proud to have survived to Yelp about it.   Maaaybe it took me an hour (or two) to finish and maaaybe I took a few breaks in between to soak in the view (i.e. prevent myself from throwing up) but I did it and that's what matters, right? :)   In truth it's not that bad, but being the complete opposite of an avid hiker, I don't think I was nearly as hydrated or nourished as I should have been to take on this venture. Luckily I was not alone, and it was fun bantering with the friendly people along the way that appeared to be having the same issue. Granted there were also a fair share of scantily clad, mega in shape passers-by quickly jolting to and fro, and I did get a few hmmm glances from them, but that was only until I learned the rule of the mountain (which by the way, didn't take long) and that was to GET OUT OF THE WAY!   Remember that simple notion, throw on some nice grippy shoes and one of those groovy camelbaks that the real hikers are toting around, and be on your way. You'll feel really good about yourself, after.

*This review is strictly based on the Macarons* And Holy Macaron-i! Are they delicious! Rainbows, unicorns and marshmallow clouds come to mind when I think of what it's like to dive into one of these dreamy desserts. The first bite is always taken in very slowly with closed eyes and a subtle groan, because they're that dang good, really. The caramel flavor is my favorite, but I've tried most every flavor by now and they're all pretty darn tasty.  I've yet to try anything else on the menu, though I have heard fabulous things, so it's definitely on my list. The only bummer is that due to their business hours (M-Sat/7-3) I'm not able to visit very often. However, considering how much I love these things and the fact that they're $3-ish dollars a piece, that's probably a good thing.

Bad service leaves a bad after taste, and I won't be coming back for more.   First time I ate here I loved it. The Pad Thai was yummy, the ambiance was nice, and it was perfectly placed next to Tempe Cinemas making a great go to for a date night...or so I thought.   Second visit was about 30 minutes prior to closing. In most restaurants that's not a huge deal, but here it means they will ask you for your order before even getting to look at the menu, remind you every ten minutes that they're closing soon, and pretty much stare you down until you're uncomfortable enough that you can no longer enjoy your meal, ensuring that you don't leave a single minute past closing. Fine, they don't like to work late. Noted.   Fast forward a few months for a stop in at lunch. Doors locked. Seems we're 15 min. early this time. No big deal, we'll wait. As we wait we see the same woman who was so rude before. The same woman who is always there. She clearly sees us but doesn't open the door...not until exactly 11:01 that is. You would think she would open the door we were standing at, but nope. First she opened the door on the opposite end, then stopped to answer the phone, then merely unlocked the door we're standing in front of and walked away as if nobody was standing there. Not a smile, not a hello, not a thanks for waiting. Nothing.   I thought maybe she recognized us from before and this was an isolated incident but I've now read other reviews stating the same. Perhaps all the positive feedback has gone to her head to the point that good service has become irrelevant? Maybe it's just as simple as her not wanting to work a minute extra? I dunno. What I do know is that part of what makes a dining experience worthwhile (at least for me) is the service. Food with attitude doesn't taste nearly as good, and I'll gladly go to one of the other ten Thai restaurants in the area the next time I get a craving.

I love visiting the theater and was beyond excited to find out about this one, particularly because Annie was playing when I had. We were lucky to get seats to the nearly sold out show in its last week, thanks to a gentleman at the front desk who called us to say they had a few seats open up last minute (Thank you sir).  The theater itself was quite cozy and there's not a bad seat in the house. I was in awe of the talent of the cast and how they were able to put together such a captivating performance with such a small amount of staging. It was a job well done and the fact that the actors posed for pics with the kiddies after wards was icing on the cake.   With what looks like a very appealing schedule of upcoming shows, I most certainly plan to make my way back.

Prior to visiting this place I thought the dinner/alcohol/movie concept was a brilliant one....now? Not so much.  Pros:  -Big Cozy Seats -Alcohol  -Food   Cons: -The big cozy seats have big huge consoles that make it impossible for one to get cozy w/their movie date (the whole yawn & stretch routine won't fly here fellas) -Higher than normal ticket prices (up to $5 more) -Parking is kind of inconvenient (be sure to bring in your ticket for validation) -Tickets need to be purchased in advance (this cannot be done via gift card) -Food/Alcohol is somewhat pricey/undesirable ($20 pre-tip for faux chicken fingers and soda) My friend even let an alcoholic beverage go to waste..it was that bad  All in all, I didn't love it. The theater was nice, our server was sweet, and the movie (Warm Bodies) was bomb diggety, but in the future I think I'll skip the extra cost/ inconvenience and resort back to watching films the good old fashioned (eat a delicious dinner elsewhere) way.

Dear Zia,   Thank you for continuing to exist.  I realize that's no easy feat for a music store in the digital age, but you manage to defy the odds, and I'm so grateful you do.   There are very few places remaining (if any) that offer a comparable selection of records (oh records), used CD's, old school video games, comic books, novelty tees and incense even. And kudos on your extensive selection of all those fun little nostalgic trinkets that take me far back  into my younger days.   It's a joy having you around and I hope you'll stay a while.    P.S. Good job on allowing me to give back to a charity of my choice when I opt out of using plastic bags. I like that.

I'm Baklava in Americaaa, and couldn't wait to get back to Yelping once I got wind of this place! It was a perfect lunch experience and instantly inspired me to get my reviews rolling.   Immediately upon entrance the owner greeted us with the warmest welcome and sweetest smile. He knew we were first timers so he took his time going over everything on the menu in detail. Can't say it made our decision making process any easier though, considering he described each option as being "THE BEST IN THE WORLD!" But I loved it. He had full confidence and enthusiasm about every single thing he served,  and it showed.  I would have to agree that the lemonade and baklava were the best around. Don't get me started on the fresh falafel, with a side of special spicy sauce, omg. The chicken was cooked to perfection, and the hummus and pita bread definitely hit the spot. The meal most certainly impressed me, and the grocery corner was a nice touch. But my very favorite part of the meal was the part where he treated me (and my lunch date) like royalty. He was out to make sure we had an exceptional experience and showed us the kinda service that you just don't see much of these days.   He welcomed us with a smile and we left with an even bigger one, as he was sure to check on us on the way out. Definitely worth a go! Go, go!

Sno Balls are NOT Snow Cones!  I learned this first hand straight from the source on my most recent visit to The Big Easy, and though the gentleman running this shop is not from NOLA, you would never know it. He's got the ice making down to an art, and it shows.   These cold treats are AMAZE-BALLS and make for the perfect snack on a hot PHX day. Even on a cold day...just yum. I was really into the egg custard, along with every other delicious concoction he twisted my arm into trying (har-har) Even after tons of sampling, we hung around the tiny shop just to socialize, as he was quite the conversationalist.  Definitely of huge fan of businesses that go the extra mile to put a smile on their customers faces and and am determined to return again and again to try every last combination he's come up with. They can't allll be OUTRAGEOUSLY delicious...can they?  Be careful not to miss it when you drive by. I've probably done so at least a thousand times without realizing. However, after having tried the infamous ice, will never be able to make that mistake again:)

"Gahhhh, sooo cute!" ---Phrase that falls out of my mouth every time I step foot into this store.  You're sure to find something you like on every visit to this adorable (very affordable) boutique shop. It's the perfect place to find random, unique gifts. As an example,  I purchased a super man cape baby outfit, owl eye contact case holder, awesome little man shaped tea infuser and back scratcher on my most recent visit. None of which I knew I needed, but all of which I was sure would bring a smile to someone I knew. And I was right. The gifts were a hit and the kinda things you might have a hard time finding elsewhere.  On top of that they have a stylish selection of dresses, jewelry, shoes and accessories. If you're a girl, or know of one...you can't go wrong here. They also tend to carry a couple of  things that a feller in your life might enjoy. This location is especially great because it's a stand alone, making Chandler Mall avoidance during busy season a possibility. Weeee!

You know a place is great when you're planning your future order in anticipation of a return visit prior to even finishing your meal, but such was the case here.  The gourmet hot dogs tickled my taste buds in every way possible, but it was the impeccable service that really stole the show. The owner was a delight and his kindness and enthusiasm is what set this dining experience so far apart from the rest. There's an abundance of pride and attention to detail here that is evident from the minute you walk in.  They offer cream soda (free with check-in), tasty desserts, table games, a plethora of condiments, classic commercials on the tube, and a lovely antique mall next door to aid in the burning of those buns afterwards. Just a few of my favorite things, which kinda makes me feel like this place was created just for me.  I'm shocked that Willy's has existed for four years without my knowing. It truly is a gem and offers a nostalgic dose of deliciousness that I'm so thankful to Yelp to have found. I will most certainly be back!

This place is as cute as button! And with countless holiday flavors on the menu (Roasted Marshmallow S'mores, YUM!) Now is the time to visit. It provides the perfect space for meeting friends, reading a book, or even just daydreaming under the trees by your lonesome as the leaves fall gently around you..  There really is an exceptional charm about this place that you must experience for yourself. Take notice of the herb garden and subtle artistic touches scattered throughout for full appreciation. This owner definitely knows how to create a happy place.  As for the quality of drinks...superb! They roast their own coffee and the smoothies are tasty, too. There was an error on my order, however in the name of great customer service my drink was on the house, which I can appreciate. The only thing that prevents me from giving this lovely place five stars is the lack of treats on the menu. Maybe it was the time of day I visited or the fact that I'm hungry as I write this, but I certainly wouldn't have minded seeing a piece of banana bread or pie sitting amongst the couple of muffins that were displayed on the counter.   Ah well, beggars can't be choosers I suppose.   If you're looking for a fantastic coffee experience (this is a coffee shop after all), find your way to Bergies. Your taste buds will thank you.

So I've been sucked into the trend that is Teavana, and I don't regret it..most of the time. The tea is admittedly pricey, but you can find some pretty good deals from time to time, and in fairness, it is of great quality and lasts a good while if you store it (in one of their $$ tins) properly.  In terms of actual product, they deserve four stars, but they lose major points for their customer service. They're incredibly pushy and presumptuous to a level that is mighty discomforting for something as soothing as tea. I feel like if I want a sample I had better grab it and run, because if I dare ask any questions I'll be brought to the back to have $100 worth of tea (that I didn't ask for) measured and packed up ready for my immediate purchase. Of course I would reply with an "uhmm no thank you" which would then  result in them trying to push me into something else. Ultimately I'm left either buying something I had no intention of buying or making up some story of why I have to go, and I don't like it.   I understand that it may take some persuasion to get a new customer to understand why their products are a worthwhile investment, but I feel like they really ought to find a classier way of doing it.

The thrill of taking that first leap (or even the 3rd or 4th) really cannot be put into words. It's a beautiful out of body experience that one must discover for themselves, and TRAPEZE U is the perfect place to do it.   The staff was incredibly friendly and encouraging. They really took the time to make sure we were comfortable and understood all that we needed to do.  It's nice that they don't make you feel silly for being afraid to jump out over a humungous safety net, despite the fact that they have likely taken the same jump over a thousand times before. They seemed genuinely interested in our ability to perform well and continously offered advice on techniques we could use to improve as well as big cheers when we implemented them successfully.  This made for a great birthday present, but would be perfect for any occassion or even none at all. I think it would be an especially cool and unique option for a date night. Whatever the case, you are sure to have an experience to remember. We all loved it and can't wait to return.  *FYI* You can try a fly for a significantly discounted rate on Monday nights. Be sure to book your spot in advance on their website. Enjoy!

What's your name? Whatever you want it to be baby.  Asking you to pick an alias for your order and awaiting it over the intercom is just one of the fun details to be found at the Duce. Mac and cheese muffins and alcohol infused milkshakes are the icing on a delicious cake. The strawberry shortcake kind, with vodka, muddled strawberries and whipped cream. Oh yes.   This place is a smorgasbord of so many things. A boxing ring with your brunch, a backyard BBQ of ping pong and corn hole, a serene Sunday of yoga?  It never ends. It's a warehouse-o-joy with no room for the snoody foodie kinds. OK, there's so much room. But it's reserved for those that like to dance and smile and hula hoop. The food wasn't my favorite ever, but it was an eclectic experience. And I enjoyed it. Hard to sit and savor when surrounded by this sweet sensory overload anyhow.   Go. Eat. Don't Eat? Drink. Sing? Doesn't Matter. Just have fun. So-much-fun.

Get your freak on here! You can give your ride a bath, wipe down her insides, AND vacuum her up for just one small payment of $3, all the while avoiding those pesky salesman/windshield guys that only look to sell you services you don't want/need. Hurry on down! (just not during the times that I want to go;) Doesn't get much better than this, folks.

There's a special little place in my heart designated specifically for JoBot, so I'm thrilled to be the 100th person to get to sing the praises of this adorable little coffee shop/creperie/hole-in-the-wall bundle of amazing-ness.  I came across JoBot by accident about a year ago while looking for a late night wi-fi spot to do some studying. It fit the bill perfectly, minus the fact that it was extremely difficult to concentrate with the loud music coming from the Lost Leaf, the interesting conversations that I couldn't help from overhearing, and the endless amount of scrumptious plates that kept parading past me.   That said, I've made several "study" trips to JoBot since. While I may not be as productive as I would be at some of those quieter little coffee shops where everyone has their nose in a book or a laptop, I find that I always walk away a very happy camper, every time.   Their crepes/tacos are delicious. All of them. Sometimes I feel as though the crepes are slightly undercooked, but once I dig inside to discover the tantalizing flavors that lie within, I tend to forget all about that. The root beer pork remains one of my faves followed by a strawberry/banana concoction for dessert. Yum, yum, yum.  Go here if you want good coffee (the bumble bee is tasty), good eats, good conversation, good atmosphere, good prices, good entertainment, and free wi-fi at any and all hours (they don't seem to close on weekends). And if you're really feeling frisky head down a house or two for some NachoBot. Gosh I love this place.

Perfect time, every time. And it's BYOB!   I've been here for a quiet date night, a birthday dinner, and a random not celebrating anything at all group dinner and every time is as good as the last, if not more so.  I like to describe it as an Asian style Melting Pot, except way better. It provides the unique, always enjoyable opportunity to cook delicious food w/your friends, but w/out the hefty price tag. Plus the ambiance is great and the soundtrack is always groovy.  There are several different broth and small plate options so every time I've gone it's been a different concoction, which is nice, but I'd have to say my favorite to date is the lemongrass. I also love dipping the meats in their side sauces w/a dab of Sriracha, mmm. There is a corking fee for the alcohol but it's a small price to pay in the grand scheme of things. The cinnamon tea they provide after dinner is a simple touch, but a sweet one. That stuff is delicious. Also, they're open until like midnight on a Monday. Awesome.

My experience at Stand Up Live left me in a state of confusion, and it wasn't because I had just discovered what a raunchy little pervy Danny Tanner was (I actually really liked that part:) but more to do with the fact that such a seemingly chic comedy club had such a cheap way of conducting business.  In reality cheap might be the worst word to use when describing this place, but yet it's what immediately comes to mind when I think of the way that they stuff patrons in the room like sardines, force them to buy multiple drinks from a menu with no prices, and then sneakily add an automatic gratuity because apparently said patrons can't be trusted to tip adequately themselves? and/or they know how angry a person might get after they realize a: they just paid $10 for soda or b: how awful the service was, causing the wait staff to suffer as a result.  I don't mind going to a place with pricey drinks (so long as they're delicious) and I'm happy to tip generously for a job well done, but I suppose I just don't like the feeling of being tricked into it. My guess is that many others share that sentiment, as there were quite a few disgruntled looking faces lingering in my area come bill time.   I realize the ticket prices are pretty reasonable ($35 for this show) and perhaps management chose this method of doing business as a way to offset that, but personally I would rather pay more per ticket and be treated with the respect a guest deserves.  With all of that being said, will I return? Probably. I'm a lover of live comedy and both of the acts I've seen here were superb. Unfortunately this type of venue is slim pickins' in our little town (a fact of which the owners seem to be fully aware) So I suppose I'm at their mercy until a kinder feller comes along.

I'm not the brand whore type, but if I was, I'd definitely shop here.  I simply cannot bring myself to spend the equivalency of a plane ticket on a yoga outfit, but I hear time and time again that it's worth every penny, so I'll chip in with a gift card here and there to help ease the cost for friends that swear by it instead.  I try and spread the Lulu love where I can simply because I love what they do, particularly in terms of offering free yoga. I've attended their outdoor Sunday yoga sessions (10 am) on more than one occasion and have loved it every time. Most of the others do it too, and I think it's such a super cool way to give back to the community. I encourage all to give it a try!

Holy Moly was this place amazing! Stuck around for 5 hours if that gives you any idea.  Made a reservation for my friends bachelorette party right around 7 so that a few us could linger in before hand and take advantage of the fantastic happy hour selection (3-7). Then, much to our surprise we were taken to our seats in the oh so classy private dining area. It's my understanding that there is a significant minimum spending requirement to dine in there, so it was a lovely surprise indeed.   The menu was pleasantly priced and had a wide range of options to suit everyone's palate. We pretty much had one of everything, shared it all, and loved it. The service was out of this world. The ambiance could not be beat. They even whipped up a few specialty items in the kitchen for the lady of the hour, which was especially impressive.   I seriously cannot praise this place enough. Our experience here was the highlight of our night (and it was a great night). It was a first time visit for many of us, but there is no doubt we will be back. Thank you Jerrmy (that's how the receipt spelled it?) for giving us gals a night we won't soon forget.

In an effort to start on a positive note, I will say that this place has a nice atmosphere. It's a very open space and I could see myself enjoying a beer on the patio during happy hour...if only the happy hour prices were desirable enough to prompt a return visit.  This is not a place you want to visit with intent to enjoy Vietnamese food as it is overpriced and for lack of better words...gross. The roll we ordered for an appetizer was okay, but the serving size was shameful considering the price, and the peanut sauce I requested on the side was very watery. Pho was the man dish, and it wasn't any better. In fact, it was worse. And with fake meat and funky flavor, it was left unfinished.  It makes me sad to think that someone may have their first Vietnamese dining experience here and potentially never eat it again as a result. I hope the owners consider sprucing up their recipes, or if nothing else dropping the 2nd half of their name, so that patrons visiting with the intent to dine on Vietnamese Cuisine won't be left disappointed.

Pretty much the best doughnut I've eaten, ever.  I am no connoisseur, despite the overly descriptive detail that will follow, but have had my fair share of donuts over the years and was admittedly impressed to find that it is in fact possible to make a version that tastes noticeably different than any other.  We ordered a sugar twist, a buttermilk, a seemingly simple glaze, and Thai tea. I bit into the sugar twist first as it tends to be a fave and noticed immediately that there was a slight crisp to it that I had never experienced. The buttermilk was pretty much just a delicious warm biscuit that had been fried twice over in sugar. So bad, yet so very good. The glaze, which is usually my least favorite kind, ended up the real show stopper.  It was like a flaky layered croissant consistency, but with that same oh-so- slight outer crisp that accompanied the rest. Just pure evil really. The Thai tea wasn't my favorite (a little too syrup-y), but the outdoor seating was a bonus, the service was good, and at just under $5 the price was right.  I'm a fan and will be trying my hardest not to come back soon.

Lannie's Nail Shop is my favorite go to for pedicures. I'm not sure what their secret is, but my rhinestone encrusted french tipped toes always seem to look the prettiest and last the longest when I get them done here. It's a family owned shop, and it doesn't take long before they make you feel as though you're a part of it. I usually see Lindsey for my toes and Lannie for my brows. While I don't personally get my nails done, I've referred my mom and a few friends that do. Those that I have referred tend to become regulars if that gives you any idea of their satisfaction level. The price is right here and they always do a job well done, while making every effort to provide their customers with a relaxing and welcoming atmosphere. My only recommendation would be that you call ahead to make an appointment in order to avoid lengthy wait times. Otherwise, they're grrreat! You won't be disappointed.

Fast, friendly, affordable. What more can you ask for?  I got a flat tire, went to the nearest well known tire chain I could find, got totally up sold and taken advantage of within minutes of arrival, went to Yelp to find better alternatives, found these guys, problem solved!  Every part of the transaction with Tires2Go was excellent. Of course one is never happy to HAVE to shop for new tires, but they made it as pleasant as could be. First of all, called an hour before closing and they told me to come on in. Then to make matters better, they quoted me prices far below what the other guys wanted to charge and that was including one of those fancy warranties that covers everything. Additionally, they had me in and out within 45 minutes time. Their service was SUPERB, and my drive has been smooth sailing ever since.   Many thanks to all the Tires2Go guys for being so awesome. Highly Recommend!

Pig's Eye Bacon Bloody Mary, say whaaa?!  After months of deprivation I was in desperate need of bacon. That and a brunch spot that would meet the needs of some of my favorite ladies (mimosas, moderate prices, deliciousness). This place fit the bill to perfection.   It was a fantastic day for patio dining and the service was splendid. We had a lot of catching up to do and the server was ever so patient while we did. She also helped us work out the best combination to satisfy all of our day drinking desires and breakfast/lunch cravings. The decor of the space was darling and was situated in an ideal locale for people watching. The only downside for me might have been the early closing time, as I could of used just one more hour to take it all in:) That aside, it was a brunch for the books. Yum.

Ice, Ice Baby!   This tasty treat tantalizes your taste buds like none other could, and the fun games, gadgets and eye candy that adorns the walls are the delicious cherries on top.   Despite countless visits (sometimes even within the same day, shhhh) I never seem to tire of scraping my bowl down to the very last sliver. Even after returning from a very extended vacay in Asia (home of all things boba) this was one of my very first, very satisfying stops.   Taro with condensed milk, mochi, and lychee is the go-to that I crave, but I dare you to discover a combination that disappoints.   If and when you make an attempt to fulfill said dare, (why wouldn't you?) do be sure to place some $ into the super nifty super hero tip jar (preferably Ironman's). You gotta give kudos for creativity and the  customer service is always impeccable. Also, whomever is in charge of the music playlist is really on to something good.     Pretty sure it's impossible to dislike this place, so just go. Eat, play, enjoy:)

Eargasm Overload. What-ta weekend!  The MMMF team really out did themselves this year! The lineup, the seating, the food, the beer...everything was perfect. The layout was ideal, as it provided viewers the opportunity to be close enough to see the sweat drip from the foreheads of the artists or spread out across a blanket on the grass depending on preference. There really wasn't a bad seat in the house and the downtown location couldn't have been better.  I'm thrilled to have such a fantastic festival right in our own back yard and can't wait to see where it goes from here. If you haven't been, definitely add it to your list. All of your senses, along with the wonderful charities this event benefits will be mighty grateful you did. Cheers!

Want Crabs? Go for the trifecta!  You wear bibs, you get dirty, you lick your fingers, you smile.   Love that this concept has finally made its way to Phoenix. I'm not a seafood aficionado by any means, but I love a good time, and this place always delivers.   Some seafoodies might say that it's lacking in freshness and quality, at which point I might direct them to a map and a calendar. If it's out of season and delivered to a desert, it might not be at its very best, but that doesn't mean it's not some kind of wonderful.  Furthermore, if you're like me and like little more than shrimp, they've got a plethora of other options. Sweet potato fries, spicy sausage, and edamame just to name a few.   It's great for groups and great for fun, but *word to the wise* if you've gotta paper cut, you better not come.
