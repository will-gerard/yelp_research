Tldr; -Very friendly staff -Authentic feel -Fish is fresh -Appropriately priced  Came towards the end of the lunch rush for my first visit. Took less than 3 minutes to get seated at the sushi bar. My order drink order was taken quickly and I received a pleasant greeting from the sushi chefs. My server was very bubbly, but didn't ask many questions or provide additional insight on the menu or lunch specials.  I deferred choosing by selecting the Chirashi bowl. The miso soup was very hot, had excellent broth flavor with fresh green onions and large pieces of tofu!  The chirashi bowl was a little under-welming at first glance, but each piece of fish was delicious, with the exception of what I presume was red snapper. It was a much chewier than I was expecting and the flavor wasn't at the same level as the other fish.   My salad showed up after my Chirashi bowl, and I hadn't expected to eat much of it, but the flavor of the dressing was really special. I ended up eating all of the salad and would gladly come back just for the the starters.  The total cost was just shy of $20, which I would gladly play again! Came hungry and curious and left fat and happy.  I will definitely be back to eat here again!

The course itself is beautiful and decently challenging ehich id the only reason I'm not rating this 1 star. They also have a 36 hole frisbee golf course (not as challenging), ehich are fairly uncommon.  However the front desk clerk was rude and seemed racist...probably won't be back for awhile.

I dropped off 1 suit 5 shirts and 2 pairs pants letting them know I'd need to pick up the suit early the next morning. They said this would not be a problem and actually had EVERYTHING ready to go when I walked in. They even remembered who I was. I only wish they had a working website or phone number with a better answering service.

The wait was bearable, the food okay, but the service and cleanliness was unacceptable. I will not be returning until these areas are addressed and improved.

Best Korean food in town! Service is great and I always leave full! All you can eat is great quality, but the price is a little high. Then again you get what you pay for!

What more can I say!? This place is fantastic for a chain. They are very friendly and the have a great business model! The food leaves something to be desired, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. They are a bakery after all!

This is the closest LA fitness to me for 10 miles. Its location isnt too terrible,  but the men's locker room smells awful. I wouldn't think anything of it if it was the afternoon or evening, but there shouldn't be any excuses at 7AM. I will be looking for the next closest locstion...

As a male it's hard to find a place both professional and inviting. I have been coming here for years now because they have a terrific environment, excellent service, and such friendly staff!  They don't take appointments on Sunday so the line starts to form around 950, so make sure you get there early!   Once you walk in it's like you're transported to a luxury salon in a far off place with warm, richly colored decorations and accent pieces.  The various services range in price, but are more than fair. I prefer to splurge and choose luxury, but to each their own.   I have never had a bad experience and all the ladies make me smile and laugh, and you really can't put a price on that!

I came in just before happy hour and the place was nearly empty when I arrived, which is what I was hoping for/expected on a weekday. I grabbed a table, propped open a book I had long been neglecting, and ordered a milkshake at the suggestion of my knowledgeable server whose name escapes me (I want to say Audrey/Aubrey?)  I had a hankering for something sweet and savory and found the Butterfinger shake to be just the right combination leaving me quite content. The consistency/temperature of the shake was near perfect. Solid enough to use the spoon, but smooth enough to use the straw, stayed cold the entire time, but never gave me brain freeze and I'm pretty sensitive.   (Tip: Start by eating the candy pieces at the top to get your taste buds attuned to the flavor of your shake. Plus then you'll have less to dig for at the bottom when you finish)  I ordered a side of sweet potato fries because I'm a sucker for anything sweet potato and couldn't pass up an opportunity to take advantage of the half off happy hour menu. The fries arrived hot and crispy with a side of ketchup and a variation of tzatziki sauce. The first half was excellent and served at just the right temperature but the second half got soft from the steam and was significantly less enjoyable. Perhaps serving in a basket with less air exposure might help.  But for now if you're going solo or not in a sharing mood, then I'd advise eating quickly or maybe asking them to fry a little longer.  For an upscale "burger" chain, this place had a good vibe, a tasty menu, and great service.  Update: They also validate parking!

Staff was extremely friendly! Very accomodating to large groups! Drinks were great and they kept them coming! Off hours are the best! If you're free on Saturday for a quick bite and and cold brew this is the place to go!

Food was fantastic and service was pretty good overall. Just wish the price of building your own burger didn't cost so much.   1/4 of an avocado is $1 and three slices of bacon $1...shakes are pretty good and the fries ate really crispy! If you get the "veggie fries" be warned they are fresh veggies that's are quickly fried (ask if you can get them a little more well done).

TLDR; Friendly staff, great atmosphere, amazing value for price, and even better quality food! Will definitely return!  Wow! So glad my first time was on a holiday! No line, no wait, and still excellent service! Got there late-ish around 8:15PM and parked in the lot in the back. $5 parking/hr during business hours. Max $15.   *Pro tip: For parking you can download the mobile app (Parkmobile) ahead of time in case you don't want to pay on site or if there's a crowd.*  First thing I remember smelling as I walked in was the tempura batter. Also, I was surprised there was no conventional sushi bar. However the chefs were very friendly and still greeted every customer who came in, ordered, and left. I felt very welcome and appreciated for my patronage.  *Pro tip: Place is small, so preferable for a small group (6 or less) or  dinner date possibly pre/post orpheus*  Was feeling indecisive but very hungry. Opted for the Omakase (chef's choice) and hot green tea (which wasn't as strong as I was expecting since I didn't let the tea steep very long). Multiple staff members offered to refill my tea with more hot water throughout the course of my meal, which I found charming, but ultimately unnecessary since I don't tolerate really hot beverages well.  The personalized order took about 15 minutes to prepare, but it was truly worth the wait. Not only was it picture worthy, but it was of impecable quality. Had a large variety of fish, preparation styles, textures, and flavors. However each order had one thing in common.  They were all exceptionally delicious.   *Pro tip: If you have dietary restrictions or are food texturally challenged, you can still order Omakase, just tell them ahead of time!*  While eating I took notice of the decor and entertainment. The walls were lined with photographs and decorations that had probably seen better days. There was a korean variety show on the television but the sound was off and subtitles were scarse...so unless you read Korean, don't expect to understand/follow much of what you see.  At the end of my meal the chef asked what I thought, if I was satisfied, and then politely thanked me again. Payment was seemless  and without error despite not being itemized. I would have liked to have gotten dessert, but they were closing...and this way gives me one more excuse to come back soon!

What a cool place! I was greeted as soon as I walked in and it felt like I was visiting a friend's house. The chalkboard paint is a nice touch and really makes the menu choices pop! I intended to get my order to go, but the place was so inviting I stayed to eat my chips and salsa.  The guys who work here are super friendly and smiled even when things got busy!  The wait time was admittedly longer than expected, but there were many people who called their orders in ahead and received their food first (rightly so).  The portions could have been just a touch bigger, but I was still very satisfied. The horchata was a little too chalky for my taste and didn't have much cinnamon, but I'm pretty picky. Hopefully next time I'll be able to take advantage of happy hour instead!  TLDR; Good prices, great food, and even better service!

When you come here (not if) you must request Chris Anderson. He was fun, charismatic, and informative! He was very knowledgeable on all the different dishes and expressed his own opinion. It was an enjoyable experience all around! Service was incredible!  However...the crushed wasabi pea sauce for the wings was heavy on parmesan and the pickles for the burgers/sandwiches were sweeter than I expected.  Oh and if you decide to do the 16 4-oz beer tour, check ti make sure they have your t-shirt size in stock...if yhey don't they eill exchange the size they give you for the size you want when you come back!  Bottom line: dishes were sweeter than expected,  but the service was sweeter!

This place is exceptionally popular around lunch time and for good reason!  Upon walking in you're engulfed by sweet/savory aromas and the quiet din of dozens of conversations.   The line to order is usually 5-15 groups deep, which provides just enough time to scope the menu, listen to other guests, and debate amongst your party what to get.  The menu consists of 7 adjacent 40" televisions floating above the serving line and offers a typical, albeit, varied and delicious selection for a deli. These televisions also scroll through different pictures of popular dishes. If you didn't bring your appetite, that's okay, after a few pictures it will be sure to find you.  The food is incredible. High quality cuts of meat, hefty portions, and an appropriate price. Pictures just can't do it justice.  The serving staff, cashiers, and bussers are exceedingly friendly and very accommodating.  Tips for lunch time:   1. Carpool. Carpool. Carpool. The place is deceivingly large and can hold an impressive number of people. 2. Get a seat/table for your group when you walk in. (Or don't - staff seem try to find you a place or make a place for you - did I mention they were accommodating?) 3. Unless you have a 2 hour nap scheduled after lunch, get a box. You can eat the entire meal in one sitting and be completely satisfied, but don't say I didnt warn you about the impending food coma.  This place is everything and more than what I'm looking for in a place to eat.

Having just went to shake shack in Baltimore on Pratt st I can say this new location in AZ is huge compared to it (so much indoor and outdoor seating)! Place is pretty empty right now (8:40pm on a Friday), but I could see it getting more packed as more people discover it.   ****Be advised any who think this a "fast food" place. Food comes out quick, but not that fast. There's a reason why there isn't a drive through window and they have a stack of 50+ pagers.****  That being said, the food came out hot, delicious, not very greasy, and traveled well. Is this my new staple burger joint? Probably not, but I'll be back again.   All things considered I'd say Shake Shack is somewhere between In N Out and Zinburger. Both in price, quality, environment, and overall dining experience.  *pro tip* get fry well! Super crispy and extra delicious!
