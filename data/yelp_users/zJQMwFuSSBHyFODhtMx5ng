Honestly we keep giving this place a chance for a love of the duck pond and patio where our kids are entertained. And I have regrets every time we go. The service is horrible. Every freaking time. Yesterday we went with our family from out of town, it was pretty embarrassing. Not enough waters were brought out for the table, no cream came with the coffee, chicken and waffles were toddler-size portion, we got the wrong filling in one of our breakfast burritos, and our server had to be hunted down to get a refill on coffee. I want the restaurants in Tempe to be great. I hope this place improves its service, the food gets better and becomes a little less sloppy overall. Because I really love that duck pond and I want to eat delicious food and have basic service while I sit next to it.

The 1 hour foot massage I had from Andy was very relaxing. It was more gentle than other Thai massages I have had. I love that he stretched me and of course, Thai foot massage is full body. What I was looking for was more pressure but I definitely enjoyed my massage. Also, the facility is clean and employees are friendly.
