Granted, it's been years since my first (and only) visit to Zapata's, still a fave of my sister's who lives in the city, but this is the best place I've had AUTHENTIC sangria, outside of Madrid!  Yes, sliced and halved fruits steeped in good red wine, not fruit juices.  At least, that's how our sangria was served all those many years ago (late 90s or early 2000s).  I plan on asking her to take me here again on my next visit next month, so I might have an update!  :)  Stay cool!

3/5/10 My second attempt to dine here, as it was so busy the first time (and so noisy!), that I had to leave.  (It was during lunch hours, and I don't like to wait.)  Arrived a few minutes shy of the end of lunch, so I was able to dine in peace.  Ordered the tofu green curry and the fried banana and coconut ice cream for dessert.  I found the portion of the entree to be very skimpy for the price, and I've had much tastier, and creamier, curry sauce elsewhere (Tottie's, Thai Elephant, even Yupha's!).  Need I say more?  Seriously, WT's green curry tastes about the same as Thai Hut's, but at a portion that's about half (or less) of what I could get at TH, or any of the other places I've visited, but I suppose the "atmosphere" is what I'm paying for here?  That said, I must admit that the fried banana dessert was delicious!  Loved the toasted coconut on top (well, on top of the bananas, but under the syrup toppings, coconut ice cream, whipped topping, and maraschino cherry!).  On my next visit, when I'm craving for something sweet, I will ask to have the syrup toppings, whipped cream, and cherry omitted.  The dish is perfect w/out them.

I was asked to move my original review to a listing for Arizona Theatre Company  instead (which I have), but I thought that my review here is also significant, for the Herberger Theatre was a great venue to showcase the phenomenal production.  The lighting was fantastic-- the subtleties were not lost on me as the scenes progressed from comedic to utter sadness, and I could almost FEEL the sunshine coming through the large windows whenever scenes from Lock Willow played out, and the cold winter air surrounding Jerusha's dorm that winter as she wrote to her "Daddy."  The ushers were very friendly and eager to help those who needed it, the cookies looked wonderful by the bar, and the women's restroom was tidy.  Now, if we could only get HT to emphasize in many places that it offers $3 parking validation...   --- I thank Yelp and ATC for giving me the great opportunity to experience a terrific performance of "Daddy Long Legs," ATC's first musical production at The Herberger Theater tonight!  The two-actor (Megan McGinnis and Robert Adelman Hancock) musical, plus the invisible, but great assets, the orchestra and sound crew, entertained and amazed me w/ their execution of a well-written body of work.  It had comedy, romance, deception, and sorrow, to name a few... what's not to like?  Truly enjoyed McGinnis' impeccable timing, as well.  It is sad that many people pass up the opportunity to watch live theater due to the higher ticket fees, and I cannot fault them-- what's easier to bear: $37 per person plus $3 parking fee, which you may buy at the box office prior to attending the show, or $10 and free parking at the movies (well, at least when you're NOT catching one in downtown PHX)?  However, when you do decide to place the financial investment, you will almost always be rewarded w/ a highly-memorable night, believe you me!    I had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend "Daddy Long Legs" to anyone who enjoys great acting and music!  (Much thanks to McGinnis and Hancock for their lovely harmonies-- I cherished them!)

Happy hour was a dish of roasted goat cheese and chicken phyllo pockets, salad Caprese, and a mango mojito.  Kudos on the tasty goat cheese pockets and balsamic reduction!!  While quite simple in its execution, the salad was perfect with the fresh-tasting mozzarella.  The mojito was a first for me, and I cannot wait to order another on my next visit, which will have to be for dinner...    While I haven't eaten at Portland's cheese and wine bar, I did prefer the natural light, decor and relaxed vibe at Cheuvront's.  I've never been a fan of darkly lit restaurants, and Cheuvront's was just very inviting.

4/26/12  Came to check out the Van Gogh-Alive exhibit, and what a great way to spend $25!  The average exhibit-goer takes about 45 minutes to go through the exhibit, which includes 5 to 10 minutes of "reflection" in the second room, where you may look at pictures and descriptions regarding Van Gogh's life and specific artworks, so do make a note of this.  Had we had more time to spend, my cousin and I would've stayed for at least a couple of hours... The music, Van Gogh's letters, and the beauty of the digital presentations captivated us so!    I did find the benches, placed in a haphazard fashion, to be very distracting.  They broke the flow of energy in the room and kept me from being able to move about freely as I wanted to, and the benches' marred my visual field as I looked across the room.  This observation was again confirmed when I found a great YouTube vid that showcased the Istanbul presentation of this exhibit, which did not contain benches in the room.  (Now, I do not mind having somewhere to sit.  Indeed, there were lovely fabric and leather couches in this exhibit, and thankfully, they were by the walls.)  I also noticed that the Turkish exhibition suggested the room to have a larger dimension that that of Az Sci Center's.  I found its exhibit's dimensions seemed more open and had a better flow.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1ACUNyN_Ec&feature=related  I would definitely recommend people to check this presentation out!  I would love to re-visit this viewing, but perhaps in another city...  p.s.  The exhibit's $25 fee includes admission to the rest of the exhibits within AZ Science Center.  Please note that the Van Gogh exhibit can only be entered and exited once, and that it runs through June 17, 2012.

PRM is the place for Inexpensive fruits, a great-tasting torta (pollo deshuesado), refried beans, and succulent barbacoa y carne pastor.  Grab a strawberries and cream cup by the juice stand.  it's a great way to end a very tasty and satiating meal.  If atmosphere isn't important, save yourself mucho dinero by skipping Tradiciones and eat at the food court.  I tried to dine at the seafood counter twice, but both times the kitchen had just closed.    To elaborate on the pollo deshuesado- I believe it's chargrilled chunks of chicken (wonderfully marinated and perfectly caramelized) with slices of tomato and crispy lettuce on telera bread.  Ah, telera!  So, so good!  I don't even recall any condiments added.  Just chicken, veggies, and the bread.    Why not rate PRM five stars?  Two reasons:   Bad guacamole- it tasted like water- so thinned-down, and yet at the same time had a congealed look about it.  PRM should be ashamed of itself for serving such a sub-par product!  Oh, well.  I shouldn't eat avocados anyway...   Rice served has corn in it-  It's also served this way in the formal restaurant Tradiciones.  Don't get me wrong- I love corn, but my immune system does not.  Why not offer plain rice as an option?  Rice and beans make a perfect protein combo  Why deny me of it?  At least I can always look forward to the tortas.

07/01/10  After my overall disappointing meal (had high hopes after reading rave reviews) at Tortas El Guero, I decided I'd check out the ice cream here- thanks to the recommendation of the TEG server.  Again, the Mexican rep behind the counter didn't speak English, so it took awhile to convey my wish to try a couple of flavors before settling on one (she kept asking if I wanted the flavor in a cup or a cone!).  I was at the point of giving up and just walking out when she finally figured my question out...  Both flavors were so good, I really had a tough time deciding!  Ah, but I do love coffee ice cream, so...  I still dream about the coffee here, so a return visit is in order very soon!

Fantastic Chicken tikka masala and garlic naan!  Gulab jamun is good, but not the best I've had.  I didn't like the palak paneer.    Service is friendly and efficient.  Preparation of food can take awhile, so don't arrive starving.  Lunch buffet available, and you can even take lunch buffet to-go!  (Haven't tried it, yet though so I can't vouch for the food served.)  Ooh, I've got to get this on my rotation soon!

My first and only visit thus far was many, many moons ago as part of a large meetup group.  Many of us started to gather outside around 7p.  I arrived a little earlier since I planned on trying some BBQ at the stand located outside the venue.  The meat sampler I had was tasty, and it was easier to turn down the cornbread since it looked rather dry.  Instead, I said hello to a beautiful slice of peach cobbler :D  While I cannot eat raw peaches anymore (a pity really, since I only started eating fresh, not canned, peaches around 2 or 3 years ago and LOVE them!), I've found that cooked peaches are safer for me, which I am thankful for.  I recall thinking that the cobbler was good.    Musicians started to set up around 8, and the first band began playing at 9p.  I enjoyed the many bands that performed that night.  The acoustics of the room was very good considering the venue's history.  I did notice that the crowd here was an amalgam of various age groups, and everyone did seem to be having a lot of fun.  One downside I found was how busy the bar was, esp. since all I wanted was ice water.  Perhaps someone should install a bottled water vending machine.

Haven't been back for many months (perhaps a year or more!), and I don't know why.  Oh yes, now I remember... so many restaurants, so little time!  Happy hour apps specials are great!  Most are under $5, and many are quite good.  Our favorites rolls are the spicy scallop and the spider (deep-fried soft-shelled crab!!).  It's been so long since my last visit that I cannot recall more HH faves, so I am definitely going to return in the very near future.  We've only eaten dinner here once, and we decided to split the cioppino.  And were we glad that we did- the soup entree was very large!  We enjoyed the bread served, and it was a nice complement to the cioppino... we enjoyed dipping it into the broth to enjoy every last drop!  Oh yeah, time to pay The Fish Market a visit for happy hour.

Terrible happy hour sushi menu!  Ate here on the 20th after a long bout (at least a year?).  The same two chefs, Julio and Roberto, were still there, as well as Leo, the manager.  I re-informed them about my allergies and placed my order: spicy tuna ($4.50), spicy salmon ($4.50), and a soft-shelled crab roll ($7.95).  Julio prepared the first two, while Roberto prepared the crab.  I was fortunate enough to ask Roberto what he was going to substitute the * w/.  He said he could use radishes and yamagobo (pickled burdock; looks like julienned carrots).  Had I not said anything, I may have been disappointed w/ the crab roll as I was w/ the other two rolls... The tuna and salmon were pretty much just rice and the mashed fish filling.  I ate a few pcs. of each dish and gave up.  (Hey, I was hungry!!)  Had leftovers packed, then decided I'd say something to Leo, who was kind enough to comp. one of the entrees.  Fair enough, since I ate the equivalent of one.  Should I return again for happy hour, I'll probably just stick to two rolls- the dependable soft-shelled crab roll, w/c is wrapped in nori, then rice, and then w/ omelet, thin-sliced.  Yum!    Since I didn't enjoy the other two sushi rolls, I replaced them w/ a rainbow roll ($8.95), w/c originally consists of salmon, yellowtail, tuna, and shrimp, w/ avocado and cucumber.  Mine came w/o certain items, but still was pretty tasty, and definitely more colorful, and more texturally-satiating than the mashed disasters that were the salmon and tuna sushi.  Probably won't be returning anytime soon for happy hour.  Certainly not since I've found a new place for happy hour sushi... Tempe's Sushi 101!

I usually have a hard time persuading Mom to join me for a restaurant meal.  Not so when I bring up seafood at McCormick & Schmick's!  We both enjoy the sour dough table bread and butter that is only given when requested.  Lunch items are decent in prices and portions.  I find that the dayshift staff here are more friendly and efficient than the night shift.  The lunch meals flowed very smoothly: glasses always full and extra hot bread brought to the table when asked (w/out our having to repeat ourselves).  Happy hour and dinner services are something else entirely.  I don't deny that happy hour apps are nicely priced.  I've only experienced HH here once, and it took awhile before I found a table I wanted to sit at (outside was noisy and smoky, and the only chairs available by the bar inside were at the ends).  It took quite some time before my server arrived.  I usually only order HH apps since I rarely drink, but she told me I had to order a drink, any drink that costs at least $2.75, before I could take advantage of the HH app specials.  So I ordered my first (and so far, my last) Arnold Palmer, which is a beverage that is half-tea and half-lemonade.  For apps, I tried the clam strips, fish tacos, and the cheeseburger and fries.  I thought the clam strips were too bread-y: not much clam-meat, just batter and seasoning.  It tasted pre-frozen.  The fish tacos were decent, but not filling.  The star app here were the cheeseburger and fries!  The burger was HUGE!!  The fries were numerous in quantity, too!  The pleasant surprise in the value of the burger and fries mitigated the disappointment I felt over the clam strips.  One huge complaint, however, was the fact that my server only saw me once, and that was to get my drink and appetizer orders.  She never came back to check on whether I would like another drink or something else from the HH and dinner menus.    Mom and I had dinner here last night (Saturday).  I couldn't believe how dead it was, considering it was only 8:15p.  We already knew we wanted to order the Dungeness crab and shrimp bisque for her and the mixed grill special for me (salmon, seabass with coconut rice and asparagus, and the shrimp-crabcake, which Mom could have since I have a shrimp allergy (sob!  I LOVE crabcakes!).  The mixed grill entree also comes with creme brulee!  Mom wasn't sure which size soup to order, but our male server told us that the cup was very small in portion, so I asked for the bowl (which, in the end, was too much).  We also asked for bread, which thankfully arrived within a few minutes.  The soup took another ten minutes.  Mom didn't think it was anything special.  Indeed, she thought that the Red Lobster bisque we enjoyed in Illinois years ago was much better.  I do remember the bread bowls of deliciousness from years past; we loved the chunkiness of the RL bisque, as well.  I told her that the higher-tabbed venues seem to serve less-chunky and more silky-smooth pureed bisques (we both agreed that chunky bisques are the best!). The mixed grill took more than 40 minutes from the time I placed the order, which is unacceptable.  Grilled seafood doesn't take long to cook!!  The entree was very delicious, though, but I would be hard-pressed to order it again if it is going to take this long to prepare.  I was also disappointed to see that the coconut rice contained *.  I LOVE *, but my immune system doesn't, and nowhere in the menu description was it mentioned that * were included.  Mom took the tainted half, but I still ended with vertigo and painful abdominal cramps from eating the "clean" half (it seemed like the rice was pre-molded in a tiny bowl or ice-cream scoop with the * in the bottom of the mold, and then placed onto the plate).  The * looked beautiful in the presentation (and Mom thought the rice tasted fine), but had I known sooner, I'd have requested them to be omitted, or at least be placed on the side.  I loved the salmon and the seabass, which were perfectly seasoned, but I found the rice too squishy, as if too much liquid was used.  The sticks of asparagus were perfectly crunchy and great in flavor!  Mom absolutely loved the crabcake... I was so jealous!  Service was objectionable: long waiting time, 2nd request for bread was forgotten, and the wait times for the seafood, brulee (yum!), and ticket were too long in between.  Hope to give a favorable happy hour update!  I'd like to try some of those grilled salmon cakes Stevie P. mentioned.  I'll have to take everybody's word on the margaritas' goodness... Not much of a drinker to justify my spending $10 on one drink.  (Although, Roy's Hawaiian Martini is definitely worth paying $10 for... so smooth!)

Sat at the bar and had Byron, nice guy, waiting on me.  I wasn't too thrilled when I saw that the $5 happy hour red wine selection was a Penfolds (?) cab/shiraz blend, but Byron said it was good, so ordered it.  (I'm not fond of shiraz...)  Chose the deep-fried zucchini and the blackened cajun-spiced chicken sandwich with fries off of the $1.95 menu, with the chicken sandwich selection entered first.  It's a good thing I added the zucchini, as it arrived much earlier than the sandwich.  I'd already polished the dish off (nice, light, crispy coating of panko with a side of rather tasteless ranch dressing), as I ended up waiting another 8 to 10 minutes for the sandwich to arrive.  The sandwich was good (loved the spice rub!), allthough I had to throw away the **.  Still a good-portioned meal without the omitted items, as it came with a side of fries.  Didn't feel comfortable enough to take photos of the food... Don't know why as I usually don't let what others think influence my actions, but there you have it.  I think happy hour at Roaring Fork's spoiled me a little bit...

11/25/10  2.5 stars.  Wasn't able to secure a reservation at either Chandler's or Ahwatukee's Mimi's Cafe, but I did have two reservations at Rustler's Rooste and McCormick & Schmick's.  Mom didn't relish the thought of having to dine outside at RR's, so M&S it had to be.  Reservation was for two at 8p, and knowing we'd be slightly tardy (we arrived at 8:05p), I'd called before we left and was told that there wouldn't be any problems keeping the reservation.  It took about 10 minutes to be seated, which wasn't so bad, considering that the hosts seemed disorganized and slightly frantic, and there were about 10 or more people waiting in a scattered formation before us (it was VERY cold outside, and no one wanted to feel the breeze everytime someone opened the doors!).  However, it took another 15 mins. before our server greeted us, which also meant we had to wait that long before getting a sip of water!  Food was, on the whole, delicious (w/ a few exceptions), but it was the timing that ruined the experience for us.  After being served water, we both ordered the Turkey dinner, each w/ a choice of side (Mom chose the sweet potato crumble, and I the macaroni and cheese), plus a side salad and dessert (cheesecake or upside-down apple pie- we both chose the pie).  Mom also wanted the calamari app.  How I wished I'd listened to our server when he recommended the crumble over the mac 'n cheese after I'd asked him which was better :(  The SPC was heaven (!), while the mac needed more cooking time.  Even the replacement wasn't any good.  The sliced oven-roasted turkey dinner was terrific, which included mashed potatoes, stuffing, fresh cranberry sauce, crispy green beans, and sliced carrots.  We were served cheesecake, instead of apple pie, and when we nicely pointed out the mistake, we were told that the apple pie would take a little longer as it was still baking, and the cheesecake was taken away.  Mom didn't care for the pie; I, on the other hand, really liked the homemade filling!  Run-down of the timing of food delivery:  8:25p- Water and server greeting. 8:35p- Salad and app. delivered. 9:25p- Turkey dinner entrees arrived. 10:10p- Cheesecake slices placed on table and taken away shortly after. 10:40p- Upside-down apple pie slices presented. 10:55p- Credit receipt delivered and signed.  As I mentioned above, food was solid (w/ exception to the mac 'n cheese and cheesecake mis-step), but service was extremely lacking. Even the women's restroom needed dire attention... Perhaps M&S' 4th year of T-day dinner will be more successful (I think this was the 3rd year since they first offered it), but I won't be back to find out.  Next Turkey day dining out, I'll make sure to place my reservation at Mimi's ahead of time!

Love, love, love the goat cheese and leeks quiche and salad combo (love the mini-baguette, as well).  If you like hazelnut, you MUST try the hazelnut royale.  Totally decadent!!  The croissants are magnifique!  I like the chocolate and the almondine the best.  I really must return soon to sample more of the lunch fare.

I stopped by for a ham and cheese croissant two weeks ago, and I can't recall the last time I felt so ripped off.  I actually wanted to get my hazelnut royale fix, but balked at the price tag- $6 a piece!  After a few minutes, the male owner talked me into trying the croissant.  After he heated it up in the microwave, he charged me $8, plus tax, which I felt was too much, esp. for a croissant that is almost a day old.  I wished it was more crispy, but since it was microwaved, the bottom was very soggy, and only the very top layers were slightly crispy.  After a few bites, I perused through tthe take-out menu and couldn't find the croissant under the dinner menu; Instead, I found it under the breakfast menu- $5.95 with white sauce, and $6.55 with scrambled eggs.  So I was charged $8 for a plain ham and cheese croissant that was a breakfast leftover??    I left very disappointed with my dinner selection that day, and with ever-increasing prices, I won't be coming back soon, if ever.

9/22  Came to try their Restaurant Week menu, and sat at one of the tables at the bar section of the restaurant.  I liked its subdued and quaint atmosphere; however, the smooth jazz music's volume was turned up significantly as the afternoon turned into dusk.  It's a good thing I enjoy smooth jazz.  Chose the French onion soup starter, the Kona-crusted sirloin steak entree, and cheesecake w/ fresh berries sauce to finish.  I really enjoyed the onion soup- salty from the cheese, yet just enough sweetness from the caramelized onions.  I really liked how some areas of the cheese that blanketed the bowl were crispy!  I thought perhaps it was the bread that sometimes one would find below the cheese, but no, it was the cheese itself.  Wished the whole piece was crunchy...  I absolutely adored the Kona-crusted sirloin.  Cooked to medium- perfect!- and I could taste the coffee, too, and not just feel the texture of coffee grains, as I've ordered similar entrees from other venues, but never tasted the intended effect.  The caramelized shallot cream sauce absolutely floored me!  One of the best sauces that has graced my lips :)  Mmm... The entree came with two standard sides (no substitutes allowed, or at least that was what I was told) of creamed spinach and smashed red potatoes.  Both were delightful- decadently rich and creamy.  Before I forget, the table bread basket (seeded dinner rolls and lavosh) was good, especially the seeded rolls.  You may also order toasted sourdough if you have food allergies to avoid.  Stepping back down, but not much, from the piece de resistance (in this meal, the standout was the steak), was the creme brulee cheesecake w/ berry sauce w/ fresh berries!  Simply incredible!   While I had to return the more beautiful (more caramelized sugar crust) first offering, untouched, due to food issues, the second was less visually stunning, but tasted divine.  I should've asked for more sauce on the side, as I ended up taking some home.  (Believe me, it took all of my willpower to stop myself from inhaling the whole dish!)  I would definitely love to go back again!

Happy hour prices seemed decent, but the selections I tried (spicy tuna roll and salmon roll) were lackluster in taste and quality.  I do have to recommend the soft-shelled crab appetizer... oh my!    While the prices beg for another try, it's going to be awhile till I visit again- so many restaurants to try first!    If you want great sushi, try Sakana on Elliot and I-10, or Old Town Scottsdale's Kyoto.  I definitely am not a fan of Ra.

I've eaten here three times since last year's first visit, and everytime I do, I promise I won't wait longer next time.  Yet, it's been months since my last meal here.  I wonder why?  Maybe it's bec. Phoenix has so many good finds!  A coworker of mine constantly speaks of the lack of good eats in the valley.  I tell him "Nonsense.  You just have to be willing to look!"    The 7th Heaven (?) salad is delicious, and I love the lemon grass chicken.  Mom wouldn't believe that the "lobster" leftover she raided was vegan.    Wished management would improve the atmosphere, though.

A cousin I'd met in Madrid 12 years ago came to town last month, so I decided I'd take this opportunity to finally try Postino after all of these years and take her there.  It was on a Tuesday, and I was fortunate enough to stumble onto the online menu beforehand and find that Postino offers $20 bottle of wine AND bruschetta on Tuesdays after 8pm.  I was a little wary that it seemed very noisy inside, but there was no way I'd have my cousin steam outside in the patio after she had just recounted how perfect the weather was in San Francisco, a stop she'd made before arriving in PHX.    We had a blast!  For $20, the two of us enjoyed a nice bottle of Heron chardonnay and a platter of six HUGE bruschetta halves (ricotta with dates and pistachios; smoked salmon with capers and herbs; roasted red peppers and goat cheese; and prosciutto with figs and mascarpone). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA#oGjoq-y0BpTf_Ug6K6vmgQ  My non-sweet-toothed cousin's fave was the peppers and goat cheese.  It was good, but I always have red peppers and goat cheese, and since I have a ROARING sweet-tooth, my #1 fave was the ricotta, dates, and pistachios.  Tied for 2nd place were the mascarpone and salmon.  I'm not much of a prosciutto fan, as I find it a tad too salty, but the sweet mascarpone cut through some of the saltiness.  The salmon and capers were so tasty!    Nice atmosphere- lots of positive energy.  Our server was efficient, friendly, and never overbearing.  Cute restroom.  My only complaint is that it is so dark indoors!  I know I've said this before, but I'll say it again- I like to feast my eyes on the food's presentation!  Please, add more light!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg?select=zsIkd6EUxXYbejAx8Srdeg#zsIkd6EUxXYbejAx8Srdeg  Cousin has made me promise her I'd take her back to Postino (or perhaps someplace similar?) on her next visit.  If that isn't glowing praise for Postino, I don't know what is :)

Why did I not visit here before??  I don't know how many spontaneous stops I've made at AJ's for sweets in the past... Had I known about Taylor's Cafe being just next door, I'd have stopped in for organic and locally-produced foods, instead of spending money on junk!  Am so glad I took the time to drive all the way to have brekky here-- I also found this plaza to be a quaint area to walk around.  Lots of nooks and crannies that hold promise for other good eats.  Any suggestions?  Before stopping by, I briefly looked at the online menu and spotted Smoked Salmon listed.  However, upon inquiry, I was told that the salmon isn't wild-caught, so I had to bypass :(  But I wasn't disheartened much, though, since I was also hit with a major sweet craving (thanks to yesterday's viewing of "The Best Thing I Ever Ate: Sugar Rush," on DVR, while on the treadmill!), so I had the French Toast , made w/ two slices of Simply Bread's monkey bread (cinnamon pull-apart), strawberries, bananas, and a triple berry compote.  I also had a side order of Boar's Head smoked bacon.  I had asked for the toast to be "more well-done."  The same went for the bacon-- delicious!  [I'm crossing my fingers they weren't made w/ allergenic ingredients (I suspect they were), bec. I'd like to buy a package of this to prepare at home.]  I enjoyed every morsel of the French toast!  Loved the texture of the cinnamon-swirl bread, which I lavishly topped w/ the compote and fruit.  (I kept thinking I should ask for extra compote, but the portion was actually just right.  I would've enjoyed an extra slice of toast, though, but that's the monster in me with bigger eyes than my stomach talking!)  I also had a cup (or two!) of the special blend coffee, made by Starbucks, which I tempered its bitterness with a little 2% milk.    Great spot for breakfast!  Can't wait to try lunch here soon.  Too bad Taylor's Cafe isn't open for dinner anymore, or I'd plan for that, as well.  BTW, service was very friendly and fast!  While my server Kristen couldn't readily address my food issues, she was quick to offer to ask kitchen staff for the answers.  And she did this with sincere smiles, which I really appreciate!  Thank you, Kristen!  Lovely murals; sectioned rooms that vibrate with differing, but positive, energies; polished and clean women's restroom; and nice furnishings complete my breakfast adventure this morning and make this cafe a winner!  Can't wait to come back, and I'm saying this as I finish off this review here at Taylor's Cafe!!

First time visiting and upon entrance, I regretted not having the collection of CDs and DVDs to donate with me, but after receiving $13 Half Price offered for the 30 books* I brought in (that's 43 cents per book), I will not come back to sell anything else.  I was going to leave the books at work so that fellow readers could get enjoyment from them.  That thought gives me greater pleasure than the $13 in my hand.  (Changing Hands gave me $11 for four books just four days ago.)  Most of the books I brought had binds that weren't even broken- some were even brand-new!  I should've just taken them back.  *Some of the brand-new titles I brought in: Culture Shock! (three editions- Britain, Philippines, Australia); Sara Gruen's Water For Elephants; Lahaye/Jenkins' Left Behind; Tim Lahaye's Revelations Unveiled; Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient; Alice Sebold's The Almost Moon; Lisa See's Dreams of Joy (hardback); and many more that were in very good condition.

Great-looking storefront!  With all of the greenery (lush trees, shrubs, and flowers), I felt like I was on vacation somewhere tropical!  And this experience, even if only for a few seconds, is a wonderful feeling-- a sweet gift, if you will!  :)  Some of the usual items on display aren't since the staff has brought out all of their Easter items.  Lots of cute pastel-colored and foiled hollow bunnies (both in milk and dark chocolate), mini-eggs, larger eggs, both hollow and filled, jelly beans, pastel-colored truffles, and decorated eggs to choose from.  I lamented that none of the mini-chocolate bunnies ($1.15) came in dark chocolate, but I was told that they came in medium- and large-sized chocolate rabbits  ($5.65 and $9.70, respectively).  I came in for 13 candy bars in both milk and dark chocolate, and left with those plus three mini-chocolate milk bunnies.  [Shh!!  The dark chocolate bars with almonds are for me!]  :D  Note:  As you may or may not know, one of See's trademarks is to offer everyone a sample.  What you may not know is that the clerks are given at least two or three truffle selections to choose from, which means you may or may not get what the person in front of you received.  Today, my surprise free sample was a dark chocolate bordeaux, with brown sugar buttercream.  Haven't eaten it yet...  I wonder when, if ever, See's will ever switch out the corn syrup from some of their products to pure cane sugar?  One can only hope someday soon...

Morning Glory offers great French toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8rlTOw0IA1TENURMBJpaXw?select=-4feMjhfMVa68yPeJJeZ1Q#-4feMjhfMVa68yPeJJeZ1Q and good omelettes.  The Farm Kitchen sells great sandwiches and a few tasty pastry selections.  Side salads are pricy considering the size portions.  Haven't had a chance to dine at Quiessence, yet, but I've read great reviews.  BTW, one can also get massages here at The Retreat!  I've never been, but there is a sign that says "by appointment only."  There used to be a giftshop where one can buy natural beauty and skin products, but that's long gone (I used to get e-newsletters).  Those products used to be sold at a location next to the vegetarian/vegan restaurant that used to be on Goldman and 5th in Scottsdale, but that also closed a year or two ago...

Spent a few hours here today (Thursday 11/6).  Nice drive up to the summit, with a few stops here and there hoping to find some trails.  I knew there were many, but I only stumbled on a handful.  This public park is supposedly the largest in the world, yet it can't afford to mark its trailheads?  I was expecting to find trailhead signs just like those I encountered at the Grand Canyon, but no.  Just have to stumble upon them somehow.     Drives up and down were cool, if a little hairy- my brain kept stimulating my vagal nerves to fire signals up and down the backs of my glutes and leg muscles.  Normally, these are unwelcome sensations, but they actually kept me from feeling some of the discomfort caused by lunch (cross-reference Gallagher's)!  LOL.    I'll be back very soon.  Would be nice to visit in the spring and see some wildflowers along with the cacti.

I could've sworn I've written and updated reviews of this place.  Where did they go?  Sakana is my favorite sushi restaurant.  If it weren't for the fact that I've developed allergies to rice and most white fish and certain shellfish (I pretty much stick to wild fish now, and you know how rare it is to find, and how expensive it can get!), I'd eat sushi and sashimi everyday!  (Well, OK, every OTHER day, for I also can eat THAI FOOD everyday!)  Lunch combos are great!  In taste and in price.  We would always order the baked mussels.  Loved the spider and crunch eel rolls.  I honestly can't remember disliking anything we've tried here.  It's been awhile since I last visited, so I may update my review soon!

6/15/10 Friend and I ordered take-out: an Arugula salmon couscous salad and a small Four cheese (mozz, romano, fontinella, and feta).  I believe I also requested ricotta on it.  The salad was excellent, although I wished all of the ingredients used were listed on the menu- I had to fish out a couple of troublesome items.  The pizza was fantastic!  And this was after we let it sit for awhile.  (I love my thin-crust pizzas hot, very crispy and fresh-- not cold nor stale, and if it's the least bit soggy, I am heartbroken.)  But Nello's was definitely a hit tonight!  I kicked myself for waiting all this time to go back for another taste.  I'll be returning VERY soon!  Music accompaniment: Dionne Warwick: The Definitive Collection.

Gave Ra two chances.  Still do not like the atmosphere, nor the food.  What's with the loud music?  Perhaps it's management hoping that I won't notice how awful the food is by painfully triggering my eardrums.    The noodle soup, the title of which goes something like... $14 bowl of soup (I don't know, it was so noisy, I couldn't think!) was TERRIBLE.  I really can't expound on why I found it disgusting.  All I remember as I tasted the broth and noodles was a flashback of Warner Bros. cartoons where a character (was it Bugs Bunny?) was shoveling paper money into a burning fireplace.  Total waste of money.  Mom didn't like the soup, as well.    A coworker of mine and I met here for happy hour and tried many apps, which I do admit were nicely priced.  The low prices aren't enough to get me to return, however.  The one plate I remember liking, so much so that I ordered it twice (we were very hungry) was made of tofu.  I even wrote it down and asked for it at my favorite sushi resto, but they didn't know what it could be, much less replicate it.  Since I'm not much of a drinker, I cannot discuss happy hour drink specials as I only drink water- I rarely order alcohol because I prefer to eat my calories.   Sayona-Ra!

I love, love, love the whole wheat pancakes that I can customize here!!  It used to be that US Egg owned my heart with its patented oatmeal-blueberry-almond wheat pancakes until I tried Good Egg's blueberries and glazed pecans (double toppings, please!) pancakes made with whole-wheat batter, and a little whipped butter on the side, hold the syrup.  If I feel like a little pain (food allergies) with my pancakes, I'd order them with special granola topping.  It is quite tasty!  However, it's heaven on earth for me with the blueberries and pecans.  The Isle of Capri omelette is delicious, as well.  The capers, sundried tomatoes, and feta cheese give the egg-y delight a slightly, uh, for the lack of a better word, funky aroma, but it tastes so good!  The side of country potatoes, while a bit salty, is equally yummy (can you guess which pieces I like best?).  I hear the guacamole and bacon that come with many dishes are very good, too.  I also recommend the reuben panini... oh my goodness!  I just experienced multiple shudders up and down my spine... bet you didn't know women could have those!  LOL.  Speaking of orgasm-inducing foods, has anyone else had a Smokey Forest sandwich at Duck and Decanter??  BTW, I tried ordering the pancakes here ala US Egg, with oatmeal and almond toppings, but they weren't the same.  I prefer US Egg's version; however, I'm a sucker for those loyal customer punch cards, and, on certain days, Good Egg even offers double punches!  Suh-weet!  P.S.  I've tried four locations [Thomas/Central, Ray/Rural, Dobson/S of 60, and McDonald/Scottsdale Rd (?)] and I prefer those on Thomas and Dobson when it comes to good to great service.  The servers there really shine on customer service and the few complaints my party and I had to give were met with sympathetic ears and satisfactory amendments by both servers and management (local and headquarters).  I wish I could say the same for those on Ray and McDonald.  ---UPDATE!--- You ever hear of those who like cold pizza?  Well, I never was one of those people.  I've tried it a couple of times, but I just don't get it [and I refuse to try it again, 'cause frankly, it's a waste of a good pizza... I'd rather resurrect it again to it's former (but not quite) glory by popping it in the toaster oven].  I have, however, found that I LIKE cold blueberry and glazed pecan whole wheat pancakes out of the fridge!  And guess what?  They're so good, they don't even need butter!  Hmm... it's a texture-lover's dream... cakey, and those sweet, almost preserve-like blueberries- some macerated, others still whole- and then those crunchy pecan bits!

Great sushi rolls and salads (try the squid!).  Can get price-y, and the portions are smaller than I am used to getting at other restaurants.  (I was just glad to have someone else pay for lunch!)  The chefs were quick and friendly.  It's always nice to see Asian sushi chefs working the counters.

Ate here many, many months ago.  A favorite pizza place for Mom and me!!  She absolutely ADORES the spinach pie, while I enjoy it and many other varieties, including the Margherita and Alaskan (white sauce, seafood).  I really appreciate the fact that whole-wheat pizza crusts are available!  Wish more establishments would offer alternative options, such as whole-wheat and gluten-free for those w/ food allergies and issues...  If thin-crust pizzas rock your boat, like they do mine, then check out Nello's!

If you love French toast and cinnamon rolls, then you MUST try C&CC's Cinnamon French toast.  Be sure to have all your life affairs in order, bec. once you've finished your plate, you'll be happy enough to leave this Earth and on your way to a higher state of existence :)  The carrot cake and blackberry bread pudding are pretty heavenly, too.  The ambience is so cozy.  Victorian and country-cottage all at once.  So adorable.  A great place to take visiting relatives and friends to, serving up great food and a welcoming atmosphere.  Check out their menus online... breakfast and lunch specials change daily.

How amazing was the Bravo, a no sauce, chevre, sausage, and fennel on a medium thin-crust ($16.25)?  Well, have a look at the photos and see just how much I had!  Florencia's thin-crust pizzas normally contain cornmeal, but I was able to specially-request one without.  Fabulous!  The bruschetta was oh, so very good-- the tangy-sweet balsamic vinegar is key in making it so tasty.  :)  Liked the fact that it had a lot of garlic, too!  The only downside, so far, was that the desserts I inquired about were all pre-made [cannoli shells came dusted w/ powdered sugar from the supplier (Kim wasn't sure that the pastry cream had powdered sugar in it, but w/ the shells being pre-dusted, the point was already moot!), the caramelized walnuts, for the Apples and walnuts w/ ice cream dessert,   didn't come w/ nutritional info (were they made w/ granulated or powdered sugar?), and ice cream wasn't homemade...  I wonder if Florencia makes its own cookie batter for its chocolate chip cookies (freshly-baked and then topped w/ ice cream)?  Again, w/ the ice cream not being homemade, this scratched out another dessert option for me.  With desserts being a non-issue, I'm able to eat more crusty pizza to my heart's content!  A very glittery silver-lining, which you'll soon agree with!  :D  Very patient and fast service- ask for Kim.  Nice, non-intrusive music playing in the background, but the restaurant got a lot noisier as the room slowly filled w/ dinner traffic, so come in early to avoid it.  Restroom was clean and very spacious-- there were two stalls when three would've easily fit!  I dare anyone to feel claustrophobic in there; Not gonna happen.  I'll definitely be back!

06/02/11  Took Mom w/ me for my second visit (her first) and ordered a small Mista salad and a large Clevenger (olive oil base, sausage, spinach, red onions, feta, no tomato sauce).  The salad arrived pretty fast, since our server placed the order in BEFORE asking us which pizza we wanted.  (Our pizza also arrived later, bec. the kitchen took extra time to wipe down the oven's surface of as much cornmeal as possible to mitigate possible allergic reactions I might come down w/...)  Believe you me, this pizza was worth waiting for!  The mista consisted of mixed greens, tomato wedges, crunchy walnuts, feta, and Florencia's fantastic balsamic vinaigrette.  (You can purchase the vinaigrette to take home!)  This salad was so delicious and so much fun to eat (crunchy walnuts, creamy feta, and tangy vinaigrette were the secrets to this simple, yet delightful salad!), I could see myself coming back and ordering a small order for my main meal and be completely satisfied.  In fact, I WAS satisfied w/ my half of the salad and could've gone to the movie we were planning to see, but didn't, bec. we had to wait an extra 30 minutes or so for the pizza to arrive.  No worries, though, as the Clevenger was even MORE spectacular than the Bravo I tried the first time around!  (And if you read my first review, you can see how much I loved that combination-- I ate half of the medium pizza at one sitting!)  I apologize for the terrible photos of the pizza I've included here... (My Mac powerbook is in the shop and isn't available to correct for the dark lighting.)  Bon appetit!

Haven't eaten here in a long time, but as I recall it, one of the very few places where I've eaten great spinach calzones.  Big, cheesy, crispy, and flaky dough- I HATE doughy calzones.    Good pizzas, too.  And the chocolate cake!

I've eaten the gelatos from Angel Sweet for over 4 years now, and I consider the flavors and textures here superior to those at Arlecchino.  My favorite gelato/ice cream flavors are dark chocolate, hazelnut, peanut butter, and any combination of these three.  I'm going to have to pay another visit to AS very soon as it's been so long since my last- I do remember thinking that I liked certain flavors at AS better than at Gelato Spot, and vice versa.  I'll need to do more research...  I really LOVE Angel Sweet's dark chocolate gelato, and the combination of dark chocolate and peanut butter here is just  HEAVEN!    I also like the flavors and textures at Gelato Spot, but Angel Sweet's are  just as great, if not better, and more importantly, the prices here are LESS expensive than at GS.  Both AS and GS have an advantage over Arlecchino's with the fact that you really are encouraged to try as many flavors as you'd like.  I've never felt rushed or embarrassed trying different flavors at both stores, whereas my first and only visit at Arlecchino's left me cold, pun intended!  I had only tried three flavors when I had the distinct feeling that asking to try another flavor would make me very unpopular with the clerk behind the counter.    Definitely a must-try!

I've been eating here for years since moving to AZ in '03, although it's been at least a year since I've visited this PJ location.  The hummus served here is one of the three best I've tried in the area (the other two were Sabuddy's (RIP) and Persian Room (nothing close to the first two, though).  It's been awhile since I had hummus (*allergy), but I seem to recall liking Persian Garden's, as well.  But I digress...  Tried the smoked salmon wrap, and the mussels (a seafood special).  Also liked the hummus w/ chicken, w/c came with a couple of tomato wedges.  Would've liked a bit more!  Didn't like how they charge for extra pitas.  Curried chicken and potato lavosh is pretty tasty!  Liked their black bean burger, but it's been so long since I tried it that I cannot comment on whether it's house-made, or just a frozen patty from a major distributor.  All I can say that it was muy delicioso!  Spanakopita app was good, but portions were small.  Ooh, try the red bell pepper hummus... delicious!!  If you don't mind spicy, the jalapeno hummus isn't bad.    Desserts tend to be good, too.  Tried a raspberry cheesecake that was particularly flavorful and silky-smooth, and the vegan carob peanut butter shake (made w/ frozen yogurt), w/c, at the time, was only available at the Tempe location, was a treat on many levels!  I inquired if Chandler's were vegan, as well, but they're not (chocolate syrup), so I didn't try.  Jazz on Thursdays was cool, but the belly dancer I saw on a Saturday was very much a beginner...  She seemed very nervous.  I hope she continued with it and is now enjoying success.

Visited  this place a few times a couple of years ago when I used to live in Chandler.  Service is quick and efficient.  I love how one can take a lovely stroll around the "lake" just steps away from the coffee shop.  On a recent visit,  I found out that CR carries Oregan chai, and it's not from concentrate.  Oh, and BTW, if you bring in your 16 oz. tumbler and order a small cup (12 oz..) of beverage, you'll get 16 oz.' worth!  At least that's what I received when I last visited and tried the chai.  I thought that was a nice thing for the barista to do...

I used to come here for pan de sal, but since nearby Manila Bakery serves up FANTASTIC, still hot-from-the-oven rolls, I only visit Lee Lee's for Lily's peanut butter, Silver Swan soy sauce, Datu Puti coconut vinegar, cans of coconut milk, and, when I have a taste for halo-halo, some jars of sweet white beans, mung beans, and jackfruit/langka.  I also like the Philippine mangos and purple yams I find in the produce section.  $0.70 cents for 5 or 6 heads of garlic is pretty sweet, too!  Durian shakes, pho, and a few stir-fried items at the restaurant nearby, now called Pho 68, were, as I recall, delicious, but it has been at least a year since I frequented the place.  Lately, I've been dining at Pho Van, which is next-door to Manila Bakery.  One complaint, and a major one... why must all Asian supermarkets have that certain smell?  Could it be the storing of rice?  I don't know, but I've yet to walk into one that didn't reek of it.

I used to visit AJ's only for the sweets (Joseph Schmidt's truffles, gourmet chocolates, cheesecakes/bombes, Napoleons, cannolis, gourmet cookies) and the cheese department.  Noticed Philippines' San Miguel beers available here, too (at least they were last year).  Laloo's goatmilk ice cream used to be sold here, but today's visit yielded none in the aisles.  I've always wanted to try their hot foods, but it was only tonight's dinner that appealed to me- salmon with stuffed crab w/ a white cheese cream sauce.  Sides were an awesome scalloped potatoes w/ bacon and cream sauce and very dry-looking "honey- glazed" carrots.  Thinking I'd have dinner elsewhere, I asked only to sample the potatoes, and they were so delicious!  Next time, plans be da*ned, if AJ's serving anything crab-stuffed and those scalloped potatoes, I'm definitely going to dine there!  Other than for the specialty-food counters, you won't catch me shopping here... too expensive!  Better to shop at Whole Foods... Products are less-expensive, many are organic, and you won't find anything with trans-fats!

I really should stop watching Food Network's "Cupcake Wars" on DVR while I'm running on the treadmill...  After many weeks of craving cupcakes, I finally relented and made a quick stop at AJ's to see if the boulangerie had cupcakes for sale.  I found a few cupcakes from Tammie Coe's and My Dad's Favorite (the clerk's fave out of the two) bakeries.  Out of the two, only MDF was available for purchase by the mini-cupcake ($1.50)-- TC's came in half-dozen or dozen batches.  (MDF also came in singular regular-sized cupcake packs for $4 each.)  I was jonesing for varied flavors, such as those I'd seen in Cupcake Wars, but all I had to choose from were chocolate minis w/ coconut-flaked frosting, or vanilla minis w/ multi-colored and glitter-dusted vanilla frostings (so uninspired), so I chose the coconut.  I should've let the mini cupcake sit out to warm up to temperature for awhile, bec. the frosting was so hard when I took a bite :(  The cake itself was OK, and I liked the bit of frosting that had coconut flakes in it, but all I could taste in the frosting was butter- yech!  Oh, but wait!  I didn't just try the cupcake here... oh no.  My attention was drawn to the salted caramel and BACON brownie when the woman ahead of me chose it for herself (along w/ a slice of key lime pie and a carrot cake).  May I sample the brownie, please?  Oh, yes?  Why, thank you!  I really shouldn't have asked for the sample, bec. I loved it so much, I bought a whole piece ($2.99).  Why do I torture myself like this?  I really don't enjoy working out on the treadmill!  No, that's not wholly true-- I don't like the first 15 mins.  But still!  I don't need to splurge on a brownie, much less one that is frosted w/ a chocolate ganache, salted caramel, AND crumbled bacon pieces!    Next time you're craving for something savory AND sweet, try the salted caramel and bacon brownie and thank me later.  p.s.  The German chocolate brownie is good, too :D  Music accompaniment: Crowded House, Together Alone.

About 5 or 6 years ago, one of my lovely sisters surprised me w/ a lovely jar of Aveda Soothing Aqua Therapy for Christmas.  I'd always wanted to try the product, yet couldn't justify spending $24 on 16 oz. of bath salts (the price has since increased to $30).  The jar was part of a gift package, but Aveda really doesn't offer discounts on its products.  However, I do appreciate that I'm able to customize gift assortments to include specific products I know the person I'm gifting is particular fond of!  [If you''re ever stumped on what to get someone for the holidays, a birthday, or any other special occasion, try your luck at any Aveda location-- all the women I know love Aveda products (some say they don't, but secretly do and just hate having to pay premium prices for them!).  You say "But what if the person I'm gifting is a guy?"  Well, I'm going to let you in on a secret-- guys LOVE Aveda-pampering, too!  I know, bec. I've bought hair products, mint soaps, and after shaves from here, and even the most-macho guys grin from ear-to-ear when they find themselves the lucky recipients!  LOL]  Anyhoo, back to that jar of soothing salts I was talking about... I've been rationing my usage of the salts for special occasions, such as when I run out of detoxifying generic Epsom salts*, or when my stash of Aura Cacia Pure Aromatherapy Foam Bath sampler pack doesn't particularly appeal to me at the time.  I am saddened to think that after tonight's wonderful bath, I only have enough for one more blissful soak :(  I know where I could get a brand-new jar for future baths, but some things in life are just more satisfying when they're gifted, don't you agree?  Hmm... Valentine's Day is just around the corner...  I wish I could give this particular location 5 stars, but based on the last few visits (once or twice a year), I really can't, as the prior excellent level of customer service I'd received has considerably depreciated.  Gone are the enthusiastic, yet warm greetings, and rarely, if at all, am I greeted w/ a hot cup of licorice-mint tea, anymore.  But I still love the products, even though I almost-always now get them at Tempe's Moodswings salon...  *Helpful tip:  Epsom salt baths are great after getting massages; a soak helps to significantly mitigate soreness you may sometimes experience after an intense session by reducing inflammation.  I know, bec. I used to say "OK/alright" when my ex-therapist would suggest a soak until I finally did one day, and wouldn't you know it, it really did help!  I now almost never go w/out a soak after a session, even if hours may go by before I get the chance!)

10/22/10  Yesterday (10/21), I prepared my own honey-buttermilk pancakes w/ Ghirardelli choccy chips, sliced bananas, and a handful of those cinnamon-roasted almonds I found at Costco.  While those hotcakes made for an excellent meal, they weren't the protein pancakes from US Egg nor the custom-made ones from Good Egg I've been craving for the past two weeks.  So, I decided I'd stop at Good Egg and claim my free entree w/ the customer appreciation card I've been holding onto for more than a year now.  My server Bailey was amiable and attentive.  She suggested I try adding dollar pancakes to my entree since I couldn't decide whether to go w/ some pancakes or something off of the lunch menu.  Thanks to the two Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives' episodes on breakfasts I'd seen during Monday's treadmill routine, I also had a craving for some corned beef hash (or those wonderful hash browns from Matt's in downtown Phx).  I decided to go w/ a full stack of pancakes ($7.50) and a side of corned beef hash ($3.95).  While having breakfast, I looked over the dollar menu wedged conveniently between the condiments and saw that for a $1 more, I could have "today's sweet deal."  Well, Bailey, what is today's deal?  A choice between an apple streusel bread pudding w/ caramel sauce or a strawberry shortcake w/ house-made strawberry fruit topping, you say?  Decisions, decisions!  Thankfully, the caramel contained corn syrup, so that made it easier for me to choose...   So there I was, for weeks craving for some of those blueberry-almond-wheat germ whole wheat pancakes and what did you think I ordered?  A stack made w/ sliced bananas, candied slivered almonds, and Ghirardelli chips!  Silly me.  But they were very, very good!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-chandler?select=0Wuwde1B28GdL1HXRxQUBQ#0Wuwde1B28GdL1HXRxQUBQ  The toasted slivered almonds added a different texture from those whole candied almonds I have at home, and the chips at GE didn't burn on the griddle like those I'd made myself.  (I'd skipped the secret step to making great choccy chip pancakes... you have to coat them w/ flour first to keep them from sinking to the bottom when you add them to the batter!  Yesterday, however, I just topped my cakes w/ some chips, so no wonder they charred when I flipped them over.)  Um, but I digress...  The corned beef hash, ordered on the crispy side, was crisped nice and salty.  It could've been a little crispier, but these were good enough.  Loved the salt-sweet contrast- what a great meal!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-chandler?select=Ojm8b8LkvBVqJ4D3Jrer9A#Ojm8b8LkvBVqJ4D3Jrer9A  The coffee was freshly-brewed and strong, and I liked having a thermos on the table for me to pour myself another cuppa.  Last, but not least, the strawberry shortcake was just the perfect way to cap a terrific experience at GE.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-chandler?select=N_Uofl8oX8l-RQMZ6i39Dw#N_Uofl8oX8l-RQMZ6i39Dw  Well, that and the large cup of coffee everyone gets to take on the way out.  Now that's a nice touch!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-chandler?select=LsiGK7lm6zIoeyI_8-cFcw#LsiGK7lm6zIoeyI_8-cFcw  If you're a Good Egg fan, you may want to stop by and partake in their giftcard offer to expire on 12/24- get $5 off your ticket when you buy a giftcard worth $25 or more!  [I got a better deal, though... ;)]

I've had great service every time I was here.  Must have a great customer service program... Same experience at sister company Grand Lux Cafe.  Great honey wheat bread.  Love the happy hour menu (calamari, Thai lettuce wraps, salad).  Try the Lemoncello cake w/ extra sliced fresh strawberries- squisito!!  One of the few chain restaurants I'm not ashamed to admit liking!

Had the new roast beef with au jus sandwich.  I was able to sub a caesar salad for the default bottomless fries.  Server was friendly and understanding as I had a few questions for her before I could order.    The fourth star was for the complimentary birthday sundae that was waiting for me when I had arrived back from a visit to the restroom.  Now why would I rate an extra star for this, you ask?  Since I actually paid for the meal with a birthday coupon, I had not expected the complimentary sundae.  Quite thoughtful of the server, I thought, and this act garnered her a few more dollars in tips!

11/17/10  And yet, another WBC update- this time it's regarding the "Thanksgiving" sandwich, which was basically oven-roasted turkey, sage stuffing, and cranberry jam on delicious whole-grain bread.  Had the opportunity to try bite-sized samples at a Yelp event a few days before this visit and enjoyed it so much, I had to have a full sandwich soon after!  Well, OK, so I shared the other half w/ a petite cousin of mine-- she absolutely loved it!   We swore that the next time, we'd get our own Thanksgiving sandwiches.  No sharing!  12/23/10  Doing last-minute Christmas shopping FOR MYSELF, I soon felt hunger pangs and WBC was calling my name!  (It's so nice to know that I can always count on WBC for a tasty meal for those times I don't feel like hauling across the valley in search for good eats!)  The aromas that permeated the air as I approached its warm and intimate setting told me that I made the right decision to eat here.  I quickly peruse the menu, thinking I'd have the Butternut squash ravioli that appeared in so many OYEs this year, but lo!  What do I see?  WBC's added a few new sandwiches, and one hot option jumped at me, and its name was "Braised Beef," ($7.99).  I'll try that one, please!  The braised beef was TOPPED w/ rosemary-gorgonzola mashed potatoes, served on a grilled ciabatta roll, and accompanied w/ au jus and horseradish sauce, w/ a side of both regular and sweet potato chips.  Let me tell you, the beef and mashed potato combo was incredible!  I ate the whole sandwich!  (Well, all of the beef and potatoes and half of the ciabatta roll.  Gotta keep a svelte figure, y'know?  LOL.)  I'm going to have to order this again the next time I visit!

Visited Origins last week in search of organic and parabens-free facial products (cleanser and day and night facial creams/lotions) and found an eager and patient helper in Cache (short for Cacharel-- I surprised her by knowing this, but I've heard of the French clothing brand from long, long ago).  She helped me search for products that were free of the allergens that plague me (corn, avocado, orange and sweet almond oils, to name a few), of which most of these natural plant-based products are made.  We finally found three products that looked promising, and headed to the sink to try using them (cleanser first, then one moisturizer I applied solely on my hands, and the other on the areas on my lower arms below the wrists.  After only a few seconds of application, my right hand started to itch a little, and upon close inspection, I found corn (zea mays), in the form of cornstarch, to be the culprit.  This was the only product of the three that I didn't closely inspect myself.  No worries, though, for it was just one more proof to myself that my specific allergies aren't "just in my head."    I hope to be able to spend more time looking over the products to see what else I may find.  Parabens have long been known to imitate estrogens' effects on the body, so if you come from a family with a history of breast, or skin cancer, you really do want to stay away from these nasty ingredients, as well as sulfates and phthalates!  (I also avoid buying these products because it means I'm putting less of them into the air, land, and water when I apply them on, or when I wash them off!)  Another plus is that Origins' products also smell delightful!    I spied a line of Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins products that took almost a fourth of the store's space, and I didn't have much time to inspect them, but of those I did, the vast percentage did contain orange and sweet almond oils, avocado, and corn.  If you aren't allergic and do want to switch to all-natural products, you may want to give Origins a try!

As I walked into the church to have a look around during the last ten minutes of the 8p Youth Choir Christmas Mass service last night (I was killing time waiting for family to get out of work so that we'd attend the Midnight Mass), I was awashed with gifts of awe, beauty, and welcoming embrace that this space always bestows upon me.  This was only my second visit in 27 months since I moved out of Chandler, and last night's first moments standing in this church made me wistful of my decision to leave Chandler and this space.  (I went from attending mass every week to only attending two masses, Easter '07 and Christmas '08, since moving out!)  Even without the Christmas treatments (outdoor lights, indoor and outdoor Nativity decorations, gorgeous red- and gold-adorned trees, Advent wreaths, white and red poinsettias, and the fabulous (to me!) scents of frankincense and myrrh), this church and its grounds are beautfully designed.  Whether or not you plan to attend a service, be sure to give yourself time to have a look around, both indoors (stained-glass windows, stations of the cross and Mother Mary grotto) and outdoors (fountain depicting Jesus, the Fisher of Men and the one-year old EXQUISITE prayer garden).  I came upon this prayer garden by serendipity- while trying to kill time and burning some calories, I walked around the lot and on my way back to the courtyard, I heard and spied water fountain jets running and thought "Oh, they must have turned on the jets at the Fisher of Men statue," w/c I've never seen, or even thought it had.  So I walked through the floral-motif metal gates (wrought-iron?) and walked around the rose garden.  Its space was absolutely resplendent with fountains, an altar for the Virgin Mary, beautiful roses everywhere (planted, and painted in murals, which were accented with rose-adorned metal railings!), and a comfy metal and stone bench.  I cannot wait to come back to this space for rejuvenating quiet reflection!  While I miss Fr. Joe Hennessy's services (he retired in '07), I thoroughly enjoyed Fr. John Coleman's personality and the enthusiastic and gleeful manner in which he presented the homily and service!  The adult choir and orchestra members (all volunteers w/ the exception of the paid composer) were impressive as always.  Thanks to everyone involved, I have definitely found my way back to this community and space.

10/11  Took the day off from work and treated myself to an hour of grounding, yet spiritually-lifting mass at Chandler's beautiful (both interior and exterior) St. Andrew the Apostle.  Father Coleman was once again a delight to hear, and the adult choir and accompanying band of talented musicians always bring joy to my soul- I am ever enthralled watching the pianist perform!  Took a few photos of the Prayer Garden, installed by Father Joe, who  retired in 2007.  Hope you enjoy!

02/07/10  What a fun and inviting space!  I loved it!  If it weren't for the fact that I was on my way to join some friends at their house to watch the Super Bowl, I would've stayed here longer!  (My first, and so far only, visit lasted three hours.)  Liberty Market reminded me of Scottsdale's The Kitchen, but geared more towards the younger crowd- college, young upstarts, thirty-somethings (who here miss that show?), and the young-at-heart.  Loved the whimsically retro mini "giftshop."  I would later on come to find that the restrooms here are reasons enough (five, to be more precise) for a visit!  Maybe it's just me, but it's the quirky touches such as these that make destinations like Liberty Market and brother company Joe's Farm Grill stand out from the pack.  (Although I must admit enjoying LM's restrooms MUCH better than JFG's (check out my review!).  So, what did I eat??  Only one of the tastiest white pizza and farmer's salad I've ever had.  The thin-crust pizza wasn't as crispy as I'd like (I'm very finicky), but this pizza was bursting w/ so many flavors!  With grilled chicken, crunchy and chopped thick-cut bacon, parmesan cream sauce, smoky mozzarella, peppery arugula, and pine nuts, how could it not?? Can you believe I ate the entire thing??  Well, OK- I did shave off half of the crust (the soggy center), but nary a chicken chunk, lean bacon (I trimmed off the fatty layers, which there weren't much to begin w/, as these chopped pieces were grilled crisp-to-perfection!), nor arugula leaf escaped my ever-vigilant fingers!  And what about the farmer's salad?  (BTW, you may find its recipe on the walls of one of the themed restrooms.)  It, too, was quite scrumptious, if a bit too salty, and contained lightly-roasted vegetables, mixed greens, heavy on the palatable sesame-crusted croutons, and a really great lemon vinaigrette.  I'd be hard-pressed not to order these again on my next visit, but I am determined to try other selections as they sound so appealing.  LM's layout made it fun to look around and get a feel of the place and what it has to offer.  The desserts looked so tantalizing that, on one of my next visits, I may have to consider throwing caution to the wind (food allergies), and select one to have with an Americano or a cafe latte from the espresso bar.  Oh, the choices I have to make...

04/21/10  Met up w/ a friend for coffee and a pastry.  Well, I had coffee and a pastry; I think she had a pizza.  LOVED the cafe latte!  I don't really care for too much foam, and this cup was absolutely perfect!  I usually order coffee w/out sugar so that I may also enjoy a sweet complement.  Today's pairing was a cherry scone.  The piece I tried had a pleasing-to-the-eye golden color to it, as well as a few lovely-looking cherries.  Wished there were more in the batter-- those cherries you see on the edges were pretty much the only ones I had (the middle was almost void of any!).  I originally had turned down the accompanying homemade whipped cream (sweetened w/ powdered sugar), but the scone was, as is usually par for the course, a bit dry (don't forget sorely lacking enough cherries!) and needed something extra.  If you're ever offered their homemade whipped cream, you better ask for extra-- it's wonderful!    I may not get another scone, but I'll definitely be back for more coffee!

7/15/10  Today's meal consisted of a pressed Arizona Sky sandwich, which came w/ a choice of side (roasted sweet potato salad); toffee chocolate chip ice cream sandwich; and a cup of espresso.  The sandwich was just spectacular!  Fontagne cheese, ham, mixed greens, roasted poblano aioli, and bread perfectly pressed-- I was in foodorgasmic heaven w/ every bite!  For dessert, I had a cup of Illy espresso and a quarter (or two!) of the toffee chocolate chip ice cream sandwich.  This baby was HUGE!  I'll have to bring three other friends w/ me next time so that this dessert won't go to waste.    Did you know that after that first cup of joe, you may have multiple cups of house coffee for free?  I may just have to pay Liberty Market a visit next week in order to finish reviewing three months' worth of good eatin'!

4.5 stars!  I've eaten at Liberty Market a few times already, but this morning marked my first breakfast- and what a fantastic meal it was!- of pancakes (3 in a stack; $6.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg#Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg w/ added topping of "market-made granola" ($1), a side of Grilled Flattened Meatballs ($3.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw#MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw, and a double-shot of espresso ($2) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg#M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg.  Service was in fine form-- I couldn't have the market-made maple syrup blend, nor any of the house-whipped cream, blueberry compote, raspberry and apricot jams, or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter (my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about), and when I asked for chocolate chips, I was, instead, offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate, sugar, and coco oil... good stuff!  This syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes, too.  (FYI, I didn't really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs... the two paired well!)  I've mentioned this once before, but I think it's such a great thing to yelp about again-- buy an espresso (or any of their specialty coffees), and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal!  Not like I needed more caffeine after the double-shot, but I did have some of the house-blend coffee.  After 1.5 pancakes, the meatballs (watch out, they're very greasy!), and caffeine, I'll be good to go for a few hours, despite only having four hours of sleep!  (I'm hoping, anyway!)  p.s.  Despite tipping more than 20% at the cashier upon ordering, I thought Bruce, the server who took care of me at my table, deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long.  One more reason why I love Liberty Market so much!    Addendum:  After getting directions from Bruce as to the quickest way to 101 N, he asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee to go, gratis!  Have I told you how much I love Liberty Market??  Helpful hint:  Free wifi can be accessed by entering the code printed at the bottom of your receipt.

Did the farm change names?   My last visit was in 2006, but let me tell you, I can still taste those peaches!  I skipped on the peach-picking (the prices were a little high, as I recall), and decided to have a peach pancake breakfast.  I didn't think it special at all- the tiny peaches I managed to pluck when I passed a tree were sweeter and juicier than the ones served to me on the pancakes.  Others who were having pancakes seemed to enjoy themselves, though.  I DO recommend the peach sticky buns!!!  I couldn't decide whether or not I wanted to splurge on the pies as I couldn't see myself purchasing one w/out sampling first, but they were flying off the shelves so fast, I decided to get one.  However, it was too late!  My turn came up (long line), and the last one was sold.  BTW, unless you like crowds and waiting in long lines, I suggest you go either before or after the peach festival.  You can also purchase preserves, peach and non-peach varieties .  I really liked the sweet potato butter.

Came here one morning a couple of weeks ago.  Had about 50 minutes alloted before my Mayo clinic appointment, so I thought a short stack of banana-nut pancakes would get me in and out fast.  I thought wrong.  Staff was friendly enough, but it took at least 10 minutes for the server to finally take my order.  I asked for banana-nut pancakes, but instead of the pancake syrup (not pure maple), I wanted a side of the blueberry compote that usually comes w/ the blueberry pancakes.  Would this be OK?  Server said yes.  The short stack (2 cakes) arrived 15 minutes later, but instead of banana-nut pancakes, these were blueberries, delivered by another server.  My server came by to ask if I needed anything else, heard my complaint, and rushed back to the kitchen to correct it.  I was assured that it would only take 10 minutes to get a fresh batch out, but another 15 minutes went by before the correct order arrived.  Keep in mind, it's already been at least 40 minutes since I sat down.  I only had 10 minutes to spare- not enough to savor these delicious cakes.  The blueberry compote ended up containing corn syrup, the ingredient I was trying to avoid by not using the pancake syrup, but it's hard for me to resist blueberry compote, so if I must suffer...  I most likely will visit Chompie's again the next time I'm out and about and craving for pancakes, but only if I have 90 minutes or more to spare...

1/19/10 Went in for my first salon coloring!  (2009 was the first time I had my hair lightened.)  Parking lot was empty, but it was raining hard, so I wasn't surprised... Besides me, I think there may have been only one other client, back in the coffee/tea room.  Again, not a big deal, since I don't like crowds.  After checking in for my appointment, I was invited to sit down in the waiting area.  I found the wait pleasant- the area was tidy and cozy, and the music peaceful.  If you like to rummage through books and magazines, or look at hair and body products (and whatever else you may find for sale at salons), you won't have to look very hard here!  You'll find something to keep your mind busy, but I like to take the time to de-stress.  The receptionist offered something to drink, which is always nice!  After meeting up w/ my hairstylist/colorist, she showed me where to dress down to my comfort level and put on a robe.  Yes, it wasn't a plush robe, and it made me feel uncomfortable, as it wasn't very flattering, but no one was around to see me, anyway, so I didn't care :)  After finding my way back to my colorist, we discussed about the results I wanted to see and feel, and she then told me what procedures she would take me through and how long each phase would take.  I found her a good listener and felt comfortable that she knew what she was doing.  I'm not much for talking while at salons, and I sensed that she knew this, but when I would speak up and ask her questions, professionally and personally, she was open to talking, as well.   I found this refreshing, bec. I've met quite a few stylists throughout the years that act slighted or mad when I'd rather not talk...   The results were fantastic!  My stylist didn't lie- the products she used made my hair very shiny and silky to the touch (some things that were lost due to the color-stripping), and the fact that it took awhile (from a few hours to a few days!) for others to realize that I had colored my hair back to brunette (I had caramel, blonde, and red high- and low- lights) is testimony that the coloring looks natural!  (Actually, the color she gave me is the darkest I've ever had my hair- darker than my natural haircolor.)  Many people did comment on how much weight I've lost, which isn't fact, so I attribute all the compliments to my darker hair :)  Easier to access than Tempe's Moodswings (free parking!) and none of the snobbery one can find at other salons.  Less expensive than comparative salons, too!!  Friendly and knowledgeable staff, comforting and welcoming ambience... Give Spa Lamar a try!  BTW, every first Wednesday of the month, Spa Lamar holds "Live at Lamar," a "happy hour" of sorts, from 6p to 9p there's live music, light apps (nothing fancy, just something from the grocery, I'm told), and perhaps cocktails.  MOST SIGNIFICANTLY, if you bring a friend who's never been to Spa Lamar, services are BUY ONE, GET ONE FREE!  That's right, you read correctly!  What are you doing this coming First Wednesday?  Hmm... I'm not sure, but I think something quite special is on the calendar...  Guess I'll catch this Spa Lamar special NEXT month!

06/02/10  Sorry, Spa Lamar, but today's visit wasn't so pleasurable.  Finally had the chance to check this once-a-month feature SL holds every first Wednesday (where an established customer takes along someone who's never been to take advantage of the BOGO offering (buy one, get one).  I was told that this feature applies only towards spa services, but that I'd be able to take Mom in so that we'd both be able to get a shampoo/cut and color.  Now, first I have to say that my first coloring (Feb.) didn't last very long- I noticed fading within the first two weeks!  I thought perhaps using another color-enhancing shampoo/conditioner set after one week of religious use of Aveda products may have been the culprit (perhaps chemicals in the second set caused color to fade), but after discussing it with Rachael, I decided I'd use more expensive color-safe products, shampoo less (I normally wash my hair twice a day on the days I work, and at least once-a-day on my days off), AND rinse with cold water after every shower to ensure that the hair cuticles properly close, but no... Mom and I BOTH noticed significant color fading WITHIN the FIRST week of the treatment.  Other disappointments include Mom's complaint of uneven shearing of her hair; my slight disappointment in the way my hair "moves" with the new haircut; the very small pool area out back, and the lack of privacy we encountered compared to the other spas we've experienced while accessing the pool, sauna, and steam rooms, to name a few.  To add insult to injury, the receptionist decided to skip me and take care of the group of older women behind me when it came time to pay.  After a few minutes, when she was ready to direct her attention to me, the receptionist first tried to charge double for the services- basically negating the BOGO offer, but I reminded her that we were there for "Live at Lamar," so she then tried to do a "buy one, get 50% off the second" deal, to which I again balked at.  I also added a couple of hair products to my bill, and after I had given her enough spafinder gift certificates to cover the salon services, the products, and Rachael's tip (20% of what TWO sets of cut and color would regularly cost), she tried to tell me that I still had a balance that needed to go on a credit card, citing that the tip could not be paid with the certificates!?!?  I asked how she arrived at this conclusion after I ran down the bill and the certificate amounts I'd given her, writing everything on paper.  She apologized and said she had not realized I'd already included Rachael's tip (!?!?).  Whatever great experiences I could've relayed to friends, relatives, coworkers, and clients about SL's "Live at Lamar" flew out the window within those closing minutes.  And then, not even a week later, Mom and I noticed the significant color loss...  I'd hate to have to find another spa and hair stylist/colorist, since Rachael seems to be a genuinely friendly and sincere person, but if I can't come away feeling blissful and know I got great color/value for the money, how can I recommend this spa to others?  How can I go back and pay for haircolor that doesn't even last a week?  Mom still complains every now and then (and it's only been 19 days, for goodness' sake!), and our only consolation is that I can't take her back for another "Live at Lamar" experience since it's a feature only good for those clients' friends who've never been.  Hmm... kind of ironic, when you think about it...  p.s.  Rachael, did you get your $48 tip, as well as commission from product sales?  BTW, the two-star review isn't a reflection on Rachael's abilities as a colorist, but the treatment Mom and I received from the receptionist, as well as the lack of color fastness of Redken coloring products.  A colorist can only do so much w/ the products on hand, yes?  A coworker told me Goldwell products work well.  Anyone agree?

Great park to go on walks alone, or with a friend!  Love the pond-- glittery at times, and on other days quite calm.  It feels very safe here, as well.  Open sight lines, clean, and I always see someone maintaining the area.  Restroom areas are decent, but I don't know if that will hold true during the hotter months...  There are exercise stations all over, but many of them need updates (cracked mats, and just basically run down).  I hope pet owners are smart enough to keep their pets away from these areas.  Who wants to do squats, lunges, push-ups, and other maneuvers, and/or lay their hands on equipment dogs have urinated on??    Watch out for runners and bicyclists.  It's nice that most of them call out from behind you to tell them where they plan on passing you-- there have been a few who did not.  Also, be aware that you might encounter a coyote here.  My friend and I were approached by one two weeks ago.  My friend was very disturbed and tried her best to scare it away, but it just kept on coming closer.  I told her we should just continue walking and it will eventually leave us-- she thought perhaps it had been fed by others before.  Here's a big tip, everyone--DO NOT FEED THE ANIMALS!  Especially those that are known to be predatory...  If you aren't a runner, biker, or walker, don't fear, because there is a basketball court, a volleyball court, and even soccer and baseball fields!  I can't wait to see how this park beautifies when spring comes around.  It's already so beautiful and tranquil in the fall and winter!  Oh, and don't forget to check out the Xeriscape garden at the dog play pens' end of the park-- there are many trees (some quite wide and tall), gorgeous bushes, and lovely water fountains and bird baths.  Learn more about xeriscaping here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeriscaping

08/12/11  As with The Limited, I enjoy shopping at Express for the good-quality clothing that I choose to leave with (one must choose wisely!), the great customer service I encounter at many of the locations nationwide, and for its terrific return policy.    I needed a couple of solid-colored long-sleeved blouses (a black and a white) to complement a beautiful b/w floral silk skirt I'd bought from, you guessed it, an Express years ago and was able to find a black viscose one today.  It's a beauty, and for only $50, it was a steal!  (Especially w/ this weekend's sale of buy one, get the second for $19.90, well, that comes out to $35* per blouse-- I found a beautiful red one, as well!  The sales rep, Beth, who manned the fitting rooms today, was courteous and very helpful when I needed a second blouse of the same color and size, because the one I had didn't drape as nicely as I thought it could; it also had a pulled thread.  Not only did she arrive back shortly to hand me one to try, but TWO!  She'd left so quickly to look for them "in the back" that I couldn't stop her in time to ask if she could locate an ivory one, as well.  Again she went back, but didn't find any; however she did say that if there was one available online to purchase, that I could also get a second one at the sale price!  (FYI, there is a standard $5 fee to have a special-order shipped to your house, no matter if you buy one item, or two...)  Another FYI: if you ask to keep the hangers that come w/ your purchases, you will be given the option to take them home in a reusable garment bag.  These are not the plastic drape-over garment bags of old, but black, zip-up garment bags that may protect your clothing from fading under the sun.  Y'know, when you forget to take them out of the car?  (Psst!  The Limited reusable garment bags are MUCH nicer!)  [*Shoot!  I'd forgotten about the extra 15% off SMS message I received today when I texted MOBILE to EXPRES (397737) right before I left to go shopping!  Hmm... perhaps I need something else to round out my wardrobe...]

11/21/13  Good deals going on, especially if coupled with mobile coupons ($25 off every $75).  Too bad I couldn't find anything I really wanted, and customer service was very lacking, since we'd just experienced terrific service with Nathan at The Limited.

12/02/12   Stopped at the Scottsdale Fashion Square mall location and dropped off my mercury Valencia handbag to have it cleaned and repaired and was going to buy a new merlot Valencia handbag to help deal with parting with the other, but was told by a salesclerk that the last piece was sold just a few minutes before.  I asked if she could check if other locations have it on stock and voila!, the Kierland branch had two and Carla (name?) would hold one of them for me.  By the time I'd arrived to buy the bag here, the store had closed early to prepare for a private viewing later on in the evening, but Carla (or the manager that evening) let me in, gave me the bag for inspection, and even extended an invitation for me to grab a couple of See's truffles from one of the stations of truffles and petit fours on display for the night's guests and a bottle of water (as is customary when shopping at Brighton's) as she finalized the sale.  It's nice to feel appreciated by Brighton staff, no matter which location I shop at!  :)

Clean and bright, and stocked with so many pretty items both useful and decorative.  A bit too cramped for my taste, but not claustrophobic.  Loved the fall items for sale!  The staff was helpful, and gave me room to look around.  (I did notice, though, while taking the online survey at home, that the clerks had not told me of sale items.  I did recall having to ask if specific items that were on shelves and counters that contained sale items were on sale, as well, and almost all of the time, the items weren't.)  Came in for a coffee mug tree, but walked out w/ a beautiful glass vase and six decorative stems of Japanese lanterns = $43, plus tax.

9/11/13  I had already visited a couple of times before (last week and three weeks, or more prior) to check out the store, the products sold there, and the customer service and came in today to use an expiring Groupon I'd purchased three months ago.  I am pleased to report that while staff members are quick to welcome guests and offer assistance, they know to leave you alone if you "just want to look."  The reps I'd met yesterday and on the first visit knew much about their products, and even if they didn't, I had the feeling they'd go to great lengths to find out.  I can't say the same about my second visit, unfortunately, but it was late in the day, fifteen minutes to closing time as a matter of fact, so I didn't mind, since I knew that all of the info I sought was online.  On the other hand, if I wasn't lucky to have internet access and/or reside nearby, I don't know if I'd have cared to return again had I not purchased a Groupon, especially after noting that the rep wasn't inspired enough to look for the info either from printed or online databases, irregardless of the time of day.  I found Ashley to be very helpful during today's visit.  I really like that MOST of the products sold here are parabens-free and MOST of the cleansing products are sulfates-free.  I find that I am not able to sample many of the products offered here due to food allergies**, but it's refreshing to find more and more businesses that strive to offer products using natural ingredients- sometimes even organic!  Not only does Lather strive to help people who are looking for natural alternatives in facial, body, hair, and aromatherapy products, but it also gives back to the environment (by packaging their products in containers made from recycled materials, by offering 10% off purchases to customers returning Lather recyclables, and by purchasing carbon off-sets) and to charities by partnering with and contributing to the following three organizations: Carbonfund.org, Cleantheworld.org, and Headaches.org.  To find out more about Lather's mission, history, and the products offered (and their ingredients), check out www.lather.com.  BTW, do you know that Lather only has three locations in the U.S. (CA, GA, and AZ), and that its products can be found in upscale hotels, such as Las Vegas' Borgata and Wynn, and Canyon Ranch?  Granted, I've never been to any of these hotels, but I know of their reputation, so I'm impressed to hear and read that these hotels endorse Lather products.  I like the slatted wood soap dish I found here, as it prevents water puddles from forming, thereby extending the life of my exfoliating lavender soap.  If you use delicate glycerine- and olive oil-based soaps, you may find this dish a nice investment, as well.  I hope to update my review in a few months' time (maybe sooner) to write about my experiences with the products I'd bought today, specifically the Vitamin C Peptide Renewal and the Shine Control Face Lotion.  **I realized many years ago that those skin rashes and breakouts I'd get from time-to-time were allergic reactions to specific natural ingredients, such as carrot, avocado, corn, rice, and any orange variety, be it orange, bergamot, tangerine, neroli, and so on, to name a few.  (I'm still experimenting with sweet almond oil... I'm thinking it's more of an intolerance, since I am able to tolerate hand and body products, but not facial.  Now that I know which ingredients to avoid, I rarely experience breakouts and rashes.  If only I could stay away from them when I dine out!

Found Top Nails during a walk after dining on protein pancakes one Friday morning at US Egg nearby.  Thought I'd try saving a few dollars since I get a gel mani every two weeks, and a gel mani/regular pedi every six weeks.  The cons to the savings are that there are only a few nail artists and a small number of massaging pedicure stations (five to eight?), whereas the previous salon I went to has easily four times the number of available artists on a Friday morning.  Another con is that because the space here is smaller than other salons I frequented, the number of bottles of polish on display, and these are the regular nail polishes (not gel), is limited.  For gel colors, you must refer to the color wheels in the basket on the table in front of the wall display of regular nail polishes.  These are labeled by brand and number.  If you can't find your favorite colors, any of the artists are happy to take what info you can give them so that the manager/owner may locate the colors for future visits.  I've only had Tammie work on my nails, and I've patronized three times thus far-- two Friday mornings and one Friday afternoon.  (I recommend scheduling a morning appointment, as you will get the full treatment.)  Her sister and mom* have helped to wrap my nails with acetone while Tammie was busy with other customers before, but Tammie is the only one who's applied the base, colors, and top coats.    She's very pleasant to converse with.  I will say that this is the first Asian-dominated salon (I've spotted an African-American nail artist working here) I've been to that employs nail artists that speak English well!  (Not just perfect grammar, but with Americanized accents.  I hope I haven't offended anyone by pointing this out?)  I have lived and worked alongside Asians from many cultures, so I am able to understand most of the spoken, and sometimes broken, English I hear (yes, I've heard Filipinos speak English with an accent, and sometimes I'm told I do too, especially when I'm speaking with family and friends in Tagalog and then have to switch to English- it's normal) and I can tolerate to hear MOST languages and dialects when others are speaking amongst themselves, but if you're sensitive to nail artists/techs that choose to speak to each other in their native tongues while working on you, then perhaps this Top Nails salon is a good fit for you!  FYI, my latest color palette is OPI Red gel (has been for all three visits) on eight nails and Cuccio #38 gel (gold glitter on metallic gold- gorgeous!!) on ring finger nails for accent.  I'm thinking all gold nails for my next visit!  *I asked Tammie if this is a family-run salon, and I gathered that it isn't.  Will try to get more info.

PETSMART HAS A NO-KILL POLICY, WHICH I SUPPORT!   I walked in a couple of weeks ago just to have a look around.  I naturally gravitated towards the cat cages and saw that PetSmart was giving away free adoptions of cats a year or older!  Each cat would even go home with you with a free bag of cat food.  These cats were either spayed, or neutered, were free of FVR/FHV-1, and were microchipped.  (Well, the one I fell in love with was, anyway.  If only I could've brought her home that very day, but I wanted to make sure my housemate wouldn't mind.)  I asked if these cats had any behavioral problems and was told that NONE of them were damaged, but that these were pets who couldn't stay with the families anymore due to either a sickness, or onset of allergies of a family member, or a new addition to the household.  Some of these cats were "package deals" and couldn't be separated from the other companion.  These cats were being offered on free adoption in order to make room for the kitten population explosion that always comes around in the spring... (Or even as early as a week later from my first visit!  I went to visit the cat I fell in love with the very next week and she was already gone!  Boo!  It was very understandable, though, as she was absolutely delightful.  Aside from the two adult cats that grew up together, the other felines present were all kittens.)  If you ever walk in and fall in love with an animal but couldn't take it home with you that same day, you could fill out the necessary adoption paperwork and the store will gladly hold the pet for a couple of days, or so, while you prepare the home for the arrival of its new member.  Needless to say, the store would rather you return for the pet sooner, than later, so please be considerate.  I knew I really didn't stand a chance of persuading my housemate in letting me adopt the cat, but I was hoping I could spend a bit more time with the lovely feline before she was claimed by somebody else.  Don't let the perfect soul slip away, even if for just a short while!

2/28/14  Called out sick from work, and I was craving for egg noodles with either beef, or chicken with ginger, so we ordered the Mongolian Beef (an entree I've already tried before), Thai-style Green Curry chicken (new to me!), and Shrimp with snow peas for Mom for pick-up.  Enjoyed the Mongolian beef (beef with onions, jalapeños, red pepper flakes, and something that looks like sweet potato leaves), but as always, I felt a little let-down when I bite into the pieces and did not find the satisfactory crunch of the caramelization of past Mongolian beef entrees I've had elsewhere.  I was looking forward to the ginger-hot spiciness of the green curry chicken, and while it was slightly underwhelming, which I'm sure is most likely from the fact that I'm suffering from a cold and could not taste all of the flavor notes, I was happy to be able to detect the ginger in the dish.  I loved the long beans in this entree, which also had basil, lemongrass, fresh chilies, shallots, galangal, garlic, and cilantro.  I had a taste of both dishes for lunch, and I would have to say that the beef was more flavorful- saltier, and definitely spicier!  The noodles were angel hair-thin and had not satisfied my dietary lust for stir-fried noodles I fancied while languishing in bed waiting for lunch time to roll around...  I offered to share my dishes with Mom, but she was too busy enjoying her Shrimp and snow peas!  Dinner time came, and I enjoyed the noodles and green curry even more-- it tasted even better, or perhaps I was feeling better from the OTC medication and rest...   Wished this dish contained a LOT of long beans, as I find myself rationing the remaining amount...    Btw, each entree came with a side salad and the signature house dressing.

Came in for a coffee mug tree, but walked out w/ salad plates and bowls (selected items were 20% if I bought four or more!), and beautifully-delicate champagne flutes and Burgundy wine glasses (two each, and German-crafted).  A few days later, Mom and I went back to exchange defective bowl and plate, and we walked out w/ a set of espresso mugs and saucers and a vegetable/fruit peeler.    The register line tends to get long, because a specific clerk, while very friendly and accommodating w/ answering questions, forgets to ask her fellow teammates for assistance.  Kindly ask if it's possible to open up other registers and someone will assist!

Checked in here two Sundays ago, on a rare day off from work, to see if I could find another painting or print to pair with a Ron Burns I'd received as a Christmas present from a friend years ago.  I didn't have any luck finding one of Burns', but I did spot about three or four other framed prints I would enjoy.  However, even with the 20% sale on posters and prints going on, I decided to postpone a spending spree.  (Didn't really have much of a choice, since I'd just left some cash for a lovely handbag at Brighton Collectibles nearby.)  I found many items, from large glass votive candle holders and jewel-like salad plates to beautiful bedspreads and accent mirrors, that I wanted to beautify my home with, but as I've mentioned, I really couldn't afford to splurge anymore.  If one was adept at craftwork, one could get so many ideas perusing through this store!    I'll definitely be back!

12/03/12  Hmm... I could've sworn I had written a review of this place before.  At the very least, I uploaded a few pics of our breakfast here many months ago.  Took my Mom to try the oven-baked pancakes once.  Do yourself a favor and pass on these!  Guess the review AND photos were taken down.  (Let's see how long this NEW review sticks before it's taken down, too.)  Cousin texted me yesterday and asked if I'd join her for breakfast at JP Pancake today, and I texted her back guessing that it was too late to warn her not to buy the Groupon... Yes, it was.  I thought it would be a good opportunity to see if JP had improved on its service and food prep.  As you can see, it hasn't...  We arrived around 7:35 am to see a deserted parking lot with the exception of one car parked in front of JPP.  It looked like we were the only souls there, besides our server and the cook in the kitchen.  I thought perhaps we'll get better service this time, since we were the only customers.  The young man asked us to sit wherever we wanted, handed us the menus and asked if we'd like some coffee or juice to start with.  I asked for coffee, while my two cousins settled on hot cocoa.  He said he'd see if they had any in the back first.  He came back a few minutes later with their mugs of cocoa (Swiss Miss and canned whip cream) and said he'd be back with my coffee.  Upon his return, we placed orders of a "Golden brown" waffle ($6.25), two full orders of French toast (one with strawberries, one with bananas, $7.95 per), and two sides of bacon (3 pieces each, $3.25 per).  I later asked if the side of ham is off-the-bone, and after consulting with the cook, he came back with a "yes."  I placed a late order of that, as well.    While the service was good (food arrived fast, server checked back to see how we were doing), the breakfast we had wasn't as good.  Our French toast slices http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA#Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA were very dry-- the menu stated challah bread, but I think it was more like cake, and the slices could've used a longer soak in the egg batter.  Out of the six halves on my cousin's plate, she only had one (and all but one of her berry slices!), while I had one slice and a quarter of another of my platter.  I would've suggested we share a plate, but she didn't want to get bananas, and I didn't want any berries...  As I've said, the only winner this morning was the waffle, and I think the dollops of butter had a lot to do with its success.  (Also, I brought my own bottle of organic pure maple syrup, since most restos offer up a non-organic cane and corn syrup blend.  My cousin tried mine first before trying the restaurant's own syrup, ditched that, and then used mine until she was finished eating.)  Their sides of bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg#OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg were very costly, considering that these were very thin slices and VERY greasy (even for bacon!).  I wouldn't hesitate paying $3.50 for a very nice plate of THICK-SLICED bacon, all-natural even, but these were pathetic-looking.  As unfortunate-looking as they were, however, they did save breakfast for my cousins.  As for the miniature slice of ham http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA#cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA I was presented with, I sent that back.  I may have been a fool to agree to waste my calories on a horrible breakfast this morning (thinking it was time to give JPP another chance for improvement), but I'm not that big a fool to allow my cousin to be charged another $3.25 for a paltry serving!  Also, zero props to our server who freaked my cousin out by hugging the wall by the kitchen with what I thought was the hope of keeping out of our vision while being able to hear our conversation without success!  Her sister confirmed seeing this behavior and thought it was very creepy, too.  I wished they'd alerted me sooner (by asking me to switch seats) so that I could see what they were talking about.  Overall, what a lousy way to spend $35* and a breakfast meal out!  :(  *Original ticket was just under $45, which showed the order charges totaling under $38 before tax.  If you account for Scottsdale's food tax of 8.95%, what was the extra $3, or so, for?  A hidden tip?  Finding this hidden charge was surprising, because our server did not know we were using a Groupon.  There was a sign on the door that stipulated that all Groupon customers will be charged an 18% tip at checkout, and my cousin did not mention her Groupon until we were given the check.  Perhaps, just perhaps, JPP assumes that all of their customers are Groupon-users?  Not far-fetched, since the Yelp reviews can't be helping JPP these days...

I rarely shop here, unless Mom wanted a watermelon or cantaloupe and I couldn't find any at Sprout's.  I've also tried looking for specialty ice cream before, such as Three Twins organic (not sold here), or specific flavors of Ben & Jerry's, but I always talk myself out of buying any.  I decided to forgo dining at Postino's today- I've been craving a bruschetta board for ages, but didn't feel like socializing, so instead went to Fry's to see if I could locate some fig jam and a cheese, or two.  Lo, I was very pleasantly surprised to leave with so much more!  After missing out on a great parking spot, thinking I'd spotted an even better one (nope, it was a deeply recessed space for carts!- they need to put up better signage for this), I had to settle for a "15-min only" spot.  Good!  I have another reason to keep this short and sweet.  (My first reason was that I was HUNGRY!)  First, let's see if this Fry's carries B&J's "Chocolate Therapy" (last night's online check said it should), as well as a "Favorite Not Favorite" flavor** "Coffee Coffee BuzzBuzz Buzz!"  FYI, I love almost anything coffee-flavored!  Verdict?  Yes, and yes!  Note to self: must pick these flavors up after raiding the cheese counter.  And oh, what a cheese counter it was!  I was in the vicinity of gourmet edibles (imported butters, pickled jars of peppers, bags of veggie and pita chips) when a woman asked if she could offer any assistance-- yes, please!  Do you sell any fig jam?  And she said to follow her to what I'd like to call a slice of cheese heaven!  After pointing out the fig and other fruit pastes, as well as the jars of Dalmatia Fig Spread (I've bought these before from Whole Foods; they're good), I thought I'd investigate a little further, even though I didn't have much time... I only had 15 minutes!  On top of the counter, on one side, are packets of chocolates.  Cute packaging, $5 each: Hazelnut, Dark chocolate, Salted Caramel, and something else.  Can't recall if any of them were fair trade, but I'm not looking for chocolates, I need something fruity!  Oh, yes!  There you are... Harvest Song.  100% Natural Apricot Artisan Preserves.  Gold Award winner?  Gluten-free?  All that mattered to me were "100% Natural, No Pectin, NO PRESERVATIVES, and Pure cane sugar."  (!!!)  I recommend this product 1000 times!  Sure, the Dalmatia fig spread is OK, but this apricot preserves is life-changing!  Especially when paired with Murray's triple creme Brie.  Found this brie wedge under "Buttery" after first checking out all of the sections and then noticing the signs above that posted descriptions of the cheeses.  I also chose a slab of Murray's Butter Kase, but that'll have to wait for another time.  My delicious late lunch consisted of a little bit of seasoned fried pork chop, four peppadews (from Sprout's), and two slices of Dave's Killer Breads 100% Honey Whole Wheat (from Whole Foods), toasted, upon which I buttered some of the triple creme Brie that I first wrapped up in foil and heated in the toaster oven, and THEN topped with the apricot preserves.  HEAVEN!  I only meant to have one slice of bread, but these preserves were so fantastic, I went ahead and toasted another slice...    **http://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/forgotten-flavors-we-love  p.s.  In case you wondered, I paired the food with organic White Silk tea- a white tea variety I am trying for the first time.  Very delicious, hot or cold, with a little bit of organic tropical blossom honey added to it!

4/11/11  It's been so long since I could enjoy bagels, since most are made w/ corn syrup and/or other additives and preservatives, that when I found out a couple of weeks ago, via online inquiry, that the bagels here aren't made w/ cornmeal, cornstarch, corn syrup, or baking powder, I knew I had to try this place!  By sheer luck, the day after the email notification came through, I was able to take advantage of a groupon for LSaB!  (However, that will have to wait another time to be used.)  As if I needed a third excuse to try this cafe, I found out that this venue is in the vicinity of where I work.  How lucky am I??  After a bit of adventure locating this place using the Yelp mapping directions, and then driving around the busy complex looking for a spot, I entered the cafe.  It seemed like luck was on my side again, bec. this place got busy right after I placed my order.  (BTW, business is still brisk as I'm typing this review!)  I couldn't decide what to try, so I decided to do two bagels: a French toast (w/ maple syrup and bacon bits baked in!) w/ honey-whipped peanut butter (Skippy-brand), and a sesame seed bagel w/ Nova lox cream cheese.  I asked that half of the bagels be toasted for me to eat here, so that I may take the other halves to-go.  No problem, said owner Michelle, and she gave me the spreads "on the side," so that I may have leftovers to take w/ me, as well.  I really like the personable service here, and I appreciate the patience and consideration shown to me by both Michelle and her employee in looking up ingredients for me.  Spotting the book I was holding (Picoult's Sing You Home), Michelle asked me if I was enjoying it (yes!), as she had just finished reading it herself last night.  Did I know that Picoult visits LSaB when she's in town??  What an interesting day that would be for me if I were to run into her on a future visit!  :)  Anyhoo, to make a long story as short as possible, I will say that I enjoyed the bagels so much, that I decided to try a third one- the wholegrain whole wheat bagel (again, half to-go), and I also ordered a small coffee.  Michelle uses the local roaster Espressions, which I was happy to hear since I have enjoyed Espressions in the past.  The wholegrain wheat bagel is definitely more dense than the other two, which were made w/ white flour.  LSaB also offers a fluffier honey whole wheat bagel made w/ a whole wheat and white flour blend.  Since I already had the sugar in the honey-whipped peanut butter to contend w/, I decided to go w/ the denser oatmeal-topped wholegrain bagel, which indeed was heartier and chewier than the other two- I liked it!  Can't wait to return, w/ or w/out the groupon!  (FYI, the bacon served here is from a local distributor, and while it doesn't contain celery juice/salt, it does contain cornstarch-- corn allergy sufferers beware.)

I will admit this review is biased, since the bagels here are the only ones I can eat, being that they're homemade AND not made with corn syrup, corn meal (at least not the ones I choose), or any other corn derivatives.  (I'm not positive about the flavored ones, such as the seasonal pumpkin bagel LS&B is offering right now through the end of the year, since "flavored" usually means "natural flavors" added, and these are derived from corn.)  Michelle, the owner, is always gracious, even when business is brisk.  It does get hectic at times, so if you're looking for more personable service, or need extra time to make a selection from all the choices offered here, you may find it best to let others go in front of you, and everyone, including yourself, will be less-frazzled.  Just took the last bite of the pumpkin bagel I tried for the first time morning, and I will most-definitely be returning to take a few more home on my next visit!  My other favorites are the Cinnamon-raisin (almost like dessert!), Marbled rye, and Honey whole wheat.  What would make me rate LS&B five stars??  1. Offer better cappuccinos and foam.   2. Offer organic and/or Fair-trade coffee options. 3. Label coffees properly to denote those that are flavored- naturally, or otherwise. 4. Offer more non-GMO options* (breads, pastries, spreads, dairy items, and meats).  *I prefer to bring a tiny dipping vessel full of organic almond butter from home to top the bagel with, instead of taking more of the staff's time and patience grilling them on what ingredients are used in their spreads.  I'm going to assume they contain allergenic ingredients I'd do well to skip.

Didn't know Party City also sold costumes.  (I've only visited one a couple of times in VA when sister needed balloons for her kids' parties.)  While the huge displays initially seemed impressive, they quickly revealed that the costumes sold here were of very low-quality.  Faced w/ two choices of spending $60+ on a costume here, or going to a party w/out, I'll choose the latter.    Better still, I'd give my sister $60 and see what she can come up w/!  (She's made a few clever ones for under $15!)  Customer service was also very bad.  The adult costumes I tried had run out of size extra-small and small, and the medium I was offered was too big.  When I asked if there were equivalent styles in the children's section to try, I was told that was a good idea and I should go over there and have a look.  The sales rep could've at least offered to check.  Any chance of my giving in and spending $50+ plus tax on cheap pieces of crap flew out the window when those words came flying out of her mouth!  (That's $50 plus tax on a costume for which accessories would still have to be purchased to complete the look.  Oh, think of how many potential purchases lost bec. of lousy customer service offered here?)  The second star was for the info given by the cashier to a friend who bought a cape that any item returned within seven days of purchase would be returnable for the amount paid.  If only I would be caught wearing their costumes in the first place would this info be of use!  (BTW, my friend returned said cape.  Nice!)

Love this Sprout's location!  I usually shop at the one on Ray and Dobson in Chandler, and this Scottsdale location is so much better- larger, cleaner, more organized!  Too bad I live so far away to visit more often :(  I'd give five stars except all of the prepared foods at the deli counter contain corn syrup and other corn ingredients.  One would think that such a health-conscious grocery store would lean towards using better-for-you ingredients and keep away from HF and regular corn syrup, among other things...

Note that this location is a factory, and not a retail shop!  Came across the sampler tea case while dining at one of my favorite organic restaurants in the valley, Calistro Bistro, a few months back.  (I promise I'll get to that review soon!)  It's quite fun and therapeutic to just inhale the numerous teas they have to offer.  After taking my aunts, Mom, and cousins to lunch there a couple of weeks ago, I decided I'd surprise one of my aunts with a gift of a large canister of the organic citrus chamomile loose tea ($37) since she had enjoyed the pot/s she had at Calistro.  My other aunt and cousin (they all live under the same roof) also loved the tea, so I know many people will benefit from the gift.  It smelled delicious at the restaurant, and the colors were simply beautiful-- my aunts ordered more water and thus enjoyed two pots o' tea for the price of one!  Since I'd already opened an online account many months ago, I usually get alerts on free shipping deals, but this was the first time I had a great reason to take advantage of it.  I also decided to order a 10-count keepsake tin of Masala Chai black tea ($14.50), and glass jars of herbal Blueberry Acai loose tea and herbal Tranquility (chamomile, lemongrass, hibiscus, licorice, and lavender) for $15.95 each.  Not only did I get free shipping, but I was also able to receive a complimentary mini-canister of a whatever iced-tea-of-the-month blend they have on hand, which in this case was Passion Fruit, with any $60 purchase!  Unfortunately, my order was missing the complimentary gift, but after a quick phone call, and a confirmation call ten minutes later, my canister is waiting for me to pick it up at the factory.  (Why waste packaging materials and time having it delivered when it's a few blocks from my place?)  The keepsake tin is cute, but it's coated with a black matte finish, thus reminding me of the tins of my dearest cats' ashes...  The glass jars are adorable, and I know my aunt will love to bring these with her when she flies home to Manila.  Will update with reviews on the teas soon!

Running low on my Dragon Well tea sachets, so I went online a couple of nights ago and studied my tea options (black, green, white, oolong, herbal, and iced).  Love that White Lion offers many organic varieties.  Since Mom and I are fans of the Dragon Well variety, I decided to go with a 12 oz. plastic canister of organic Dragon Well loose tea ($38).  I've never tried white tea before, so I chose a 1.5 oz glass jar** of organic White Silk, the only organic variety out of the four white teas WL sells.  I wanted to purchase sachets, for the simplicity they offer when I want to have tea and do not have my cast-iron tea pot with me, but I'm still waiting for WL's response to my query of what their "silky bags" are made of.  (I think they're nylon bags, but I want to rule out PLA, or polylactic acid, which is a "bioplastic derived from GMO corn.")***  Other organic tea varieties I've enjoyed from White Lion Tea are  Green: Jasmine Herbal: Tranquility, Blueberry Acai, Apple Cider  White Lion Tea offers free shipping for $60 purchases and above, but I opted for local pickup to avoid unnecessary packaging and shipping; at the shipping drop down options, choose "local pickup."  (Note to self: bring a reusable bag so that I won't have to recycle another cardboard box when I arrive home.)  Staff present today were friendly!  I asked if WL holds tea tastings anywhere and was told that they'd "love to" offer them at restaurants.  I think perhaps they thought I was a representative of one- I wish!  Note to restaurant owners and chefs... White Lion Tea wishes to hold tea tastings!  Oye mi canto!  Today's box of goodies also contained a sample packet of White Lion's newest tea offering... Root Beer tea!  Here's a description excerpt from the website:  This caffeine free blend combines green rooibos & honeybush along with a blend of herbs, stevia, and natural flavors to create a sweet, antioxidant rich alternative to the real thing.  If you decide to order from the website and do choose local pickup, watch out for the adorable cream and mahogany Irish Setter to run out of the door when you walk in!  It must've spotted something out there, for it started to point with its bent foreleg.  Too cute!    **These cork-topped glass jars are very charming, so watch out!  An aunt wanted to take home some teas, and it turned out she really just wanted the glass jars!  She did fall in love with the tea inside them, though!  :)  ***For more info on what else you may be drinking with your tea... http://anh-europe.org/2013/10/16/are-you-drinking-gmos-or-plastic-with-your-tea/  ------- 9/30/15 UPDATE: Tried the root beer tea a few nights ago and developed an AWFUL migraine.  Was so disappointed for the intolerance/allergy, because the tea smelled and tasted WONDERFUL!  Exactly like root beer!  Well, almost, because I drank it while it was hot.  I should've waited till it had chilled for an hour, or two in the fridge, but I couldn't wait- it smelled so good!  Perhaps it was an herb (or more) or the "natural flavors" (usually derived from corn) that triggered the migraine.  Who knows?  I hope this doesn't keep many of you from trying the seasonal tea.  If you are among the lucky population that do not have intolerances or food allergies to certain herbs, stevia, and natural flavors AND you like root beer, I think you'll find yourself huge fans of this tea!  #780

Updating my review to reflect 3.5 stars (rounding up) due to great service from Sophia, a manicurist I'd tried once or twice a year or more ago and am seeing regularly again, and from the people who answer the phone and manage the appointment bookings.  The latter have been extremely helpful in booking and rescheduling appointments at the salon and over the phone, and I'm grateful for the professionalism they've shown me.    I've been seeing the fabulous Sophia, because the one I've been seeing for over a year and a half, "T," yelled at me, not once, but at least three times (!) for booking a fifteen minute polish change session prior to my sister's gel manicure appointment with her last month.  (I had a gel mani and pedi session with her a week before where I had eight fingernails painted red and two with silver, but work threatened to write me up if I didn't have them changed to reflect uniform color- same colors/designs- so here I am seeing her again...)  I told her I did not appreciate her yelling at me, particularly when I brought my sister, who's visiting from Houston, in specifically to see her.  We were there even earlier, so that I could assist sister in choosing a polish color.  Both of our sessions haven't even started and I was already in a foul mood!  :(  Instead of taking up space here rehashing what happened, I'm just going to say that I'm not booking any appointments with "T" anymore.  I've found a new favorite to book gel manis and pedis with (combo is $56 and upwards if you add on other details).  There are many salons that charge less ($8 to $20 less!) for a gel mani and pedi, as I, Mom, relatives, and coworkers can attest to, here in Scottsdale and around the valley, but as long as I can depend on the professionalism, friendliness, and speediness of the nail technicians and staff here, I will continue to book appointments, as well as bring in visiting family and friends!

Friend raved about the margaritas here, so we checked out Arriba's for dinner last night.  I'd called ahead to ask if Arriba's makes their sour mix from scratch- it does.  I also inquired about happy hour-- from 3p to 7p, and reverse HH from 9p to closing, 12 oz. house margaritas are $0.99 each!  There's a short list of apps at 50% off, as well.  He wanted to try the "margarita for two" on the rocks, as he's tried the house margarita on previous occasions.  Presentation was nice, and it tasted very good- not obnoxiously strong and not cloyingly sweet. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=ZuAE6ZAXVIeGNKKMWbJogw#ZuAE6ZAXVIeGNKKMWbJogw  $7 during happy hour, which I thought was a steal, since the last time I shared a margarita that big (with sister) was at one of the restaurants on the San Antonio's touristy River Walk-- the margarita was $14!  Our drink last night had a LOT of ice, though, so we'll have to request for less ice next time, and there will BE a next time.  :)  Our server also suggested guacamole and chips, or a queso fundido app, so I chose the latter.  We both loved the cheese dip, despite the fact that my friend hates tomatoes and there were tomatoes mixed into the fondue. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=fVPVC3W4MQx5SNDyVN1QMw#fVPVC3W4MQx5SNDyVN1QMw  The fondue/fundido also came with a dollop of chorizo.  I appreciated its spiciness, but found it too salty.  Due to my corn allergy, I requested for fried flour tortilla chips for dipping, and thankfully, the kitchen obliged!  Awesome service, so far, which reminds me kudos to our server Chance! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=F8pySbJ7wQ_z3O5Bj-u5eQ#F8pySbJ7wQ_z3O5Bj-u5eQ  Friend didn't enjoy the flour tortilla chips as much as I did, so he asked for regular corn tortilla chips, and again, Chance and kitchen gratified.  My friend was going to order the enchiladas, and I told him I was going to try Arriba's pollo con queso.  He's had it before, so he decided that we'd just share the entree.  Fine by me, since I don't ever finish an entree at the restaurant, anyway.  (I always take leftovers home.)  The entree was a deep-fried chicken burrito, split three-ways, and smothered with three different cheeses. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=hzYXTqkmjXz9IOQ-AjgVoA#hzYXTqkmjXz9IOQ-AjgVoA  I don't know what kind of cheeses, and the menu online does not state what they are, but I liked the white variety the best- it's a softer cheese, which equals meltier, creamier, more sensual cheese to me!  He liked one of the dark yellow cheeses.  Will have to get more info on our next visit.  I wonder if I may order this dish with just the one type of cheese?  Hmm... further investigation of the menu is needed!  ;)  My friend doesn't have a sweet tooth, and none of the desserts really caught my eye last night, except perhaps the ones with ice cream; However, Arriba uses Good Humor ice cream, and these contain corn syrup, so I must say no.  Only the best, for the most part, para mi, por favor!  Can't wait to take Mom here.  I've already told her about the dinner and shown her the photos, and she looks very interested.  :D

04/30/13  Love the burgers and sandwiches (sometimes the kitchen forgets to add one or two key ingredients, say the anaheim chili I ask for instead of jalapeno pepper, or the onion strings) and the dinner specials I've tried at the restaurant hardly disappoint (!), but I really must stop ordering the pasta dinner specials to go.  I've enjoyed the fettucine alfredo that arrived with garlic bread (terrific bread!), but other pasta varieties have left me shaking my head and wanting for more.  Take into consideration the latest special I ordered, the Green Chile penne with grilled chicken.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/four-peaks-brewery-scottsdale-2?select=6gAA2123ljhlmZl2SqKgOA#6gAA2123ljhlmZl2SqKgOA  Photo was taken before I had a bite.  At $15 plus tax, I felt gypped.  What do you think?  The flavors weren't bad, though.  Rich and cheesy, and the green chiles added a lot of heat (!)-- more so than other cheesy green chile pasta dishes I've had elsewhere.  The grilled chicken was pretty good, too-- I don't eat a lot of chicken anymore, so when I do order it, I appreciate when it's done right.    I will keep an eye out for this special to appear on the dinner specials' rotation again, but I will order it for dining-in.  As I've said, I've rarely been disappointed with the dinner specials when dining on, so maybe that's the secret?  We shall see.

Came in tonight and approached a male rep and said "It's very cold in my room...," and before I could finish my sentence, he laughed and replied "And what would you like me to do about that?"  I haha-ed along and asked if there was something at HD that I could insulate the windows and doors with, to keep the coldness out, and I mentioned that a friend had told me about window treatments (plastic sheets)** that she and her husband had bought and used about fifteen years ago where they used a blow dryer to apply them.  He said that there's really nothing to do except to install double-pane glass, and perhaps to use thermal strips to weatherproof doors and added that the treatments my friend told me about sounded "like an old wives' tale..."  I thanked him for his help and moved on.  I looked around the windows and doors dept. to see if I could spot those thermal sheets, but didn't find any.   **My friend texted a screenshot of a flyer advertising said thermal insulation sheets from Ace Hardware.  Will try to look for them tomorrow.

Love this parish, its members, the priests I've had the pleasure to listen to, and its beautiful atmosphere w/in the church and its surroundings outdoors.  Parking isn't a problem, if you come early enough, and even if you are cutting it close to mass start times, the walk to the parish's doors isn't very far.  If you plan on grabbing a bite to eat before or after mass, be sure to check St. Patrick's website before heading to church, as it will inform you whether the upcoming/current Sunday morning masses will be followed  by donuts or a pancake breakfast, sponsored by the Knights of Columbus, and coffee, sponsored by the coffee ministry.  Speaking of coffee, I always see tables of (Fair Trade?) Justa coffee for sale on one side of the lobby.  I need to leave the house a little earlier so that I will have time to ask someone about the coffee sold here.  I'm assuming the profits support one or more of the church's many ministries... I hope to have some answers for you soon!

I thought I'd update my reviews here by mentioning that there will be an ice cream social event on Saturday, July 27th, from 2p to 5p, or so an e-newsletter informed me this morning!  I clicked on the Facebook link http://wholefoodsmarket.com/blog/youre-cordially-invited-ice-cream-social-july-27?sf15241907=1 to get more information, which led me to a WF website link that stated "all Whole Foods" will be participating.  I wish I could go, because not only will WF have their own brand of ice cream on-hand, but one of my favorite organic brands, Three Twins, is going to be featured, and both email and website state that for every Three Twins purchase made, one dollar will be donated to the Non-GMO Project!  To find out more this organization, please visit http://nongmoproject.com.  The website mentioned all WF stores are participating, but that "some stores might have sweet concoctions up their sleeve like sundaes, shakes, floats and malts and many are planning fun events for kids and adults alike..."    Wish I could attend the event myself, but I'll be at work, so for those of you planning to attend, just have an extra tablespoon of ice cream for me!  :)  Read more about the event here http://wholefoodsmarket.com/blog/youre-cordially-invited-ice-cream-social-july-27?sf15241907=1

Tried to find out if a few pastries contained corn syrup, cornstarch, or powdered sugar in the chocolate glazes and cream fillings, but the woman wearing a baker's coat didn't know which ones did, and which ones didn't.  She just looked at the pastries I pointed out with a blank stare and said "It's hard to tell which ones do and which ones don't."  Did she tell me to call so and so in the morning to find out?  Nope.  Prices seem very high compared to the sizing of the pastries.   I don't mind paying for quality ingredients, but if the "baker" on duty can't answer a few questions, then I'll find another bakery with staff who can!  p.s.  A younger woman, who was assisting a customer looking into a book of cake designs, asked the woman I had just questioned earlier if they could do an almond cake filling, so it would seem that the woman does some baking here.  I thought perhaps I'd just asked someone tending the register who didn't know anything about the products they sold here...  I'm off to find pastries elsewhere!

First visit was for lunch about a year ago, and I tried one of their specialty noodle dishes (#100) and didn't enjoy it.  I was partly to blame since I only enjoy whole wheat and gourmet pastas, and rice and egg noodles either do not satisfy me, or I feel too guilty to enjoy eating them.  So I avoided the noodles and concentrated on the filling and found it blah.  I've since had Siamese Cat take-out twice in the past two weeks.  The household enjoyed the following very much:  #24 Rama w/ Beef (cabbage and peanut sauce topped w/ crispy egg noodles and red onion) #27 Gaeng Keao Wan w/ Chicken (coconut green curry w/ green bell peppers, bamboo shoots, and basil) #30 Gaeng Ped  w/ Chicken (red coconut curry w/ carrots, peas, bamboo shoots, and basil) #103 Pad Pak Gratiem Prik Thai (chicken w/ pepper, fresh garlic, and "chef's sauce")  I am a fan of green curry of nany Thai restaurants (I'm told by a close Thai coworker/friend of mine that Thai curries are some of the easiest foods to prepare), but not this one. SC serves it with bamboo shoots, green bell pepper, basil, and coconut milk.  Green bell pepper (part of the nightshade family of plants and contains solanine, a glycoalkaloid that can trigger pain) is an inflammatory food, and since I'm allergic to many foods, I try to stay away from as many pro-inflammatory foods as I can.  Perhaps my slight aversion to green bell pepper (though I do like the flavor this item delivers in many recipes) mars my enjoyment of this dish since it plays such a major role here.  My only complaint with SC for now is that the entrees are a little too salty.  Otherwise, I'm a fan!    BTW, deep-frying greatly decreases the glycoalkaloid content of nightshade plant foods... french fries and fried green tomatoes, anyone?  Too bad, fried foods can also trigger inflammation in blood vessels, among other symptoms of chronic inflammatory disorders/diseases...

Always stop here for a bag each of candy-shelled chocolate-covered peanuts and chocolate-covered almonds from the bulk section.  Love the organic Mountain Fresh and Brown Cow yogurts.  As for the produce I buy here, I must first say that I triple-, sometimes quadruple-inspect my options before I purchase at any grocery I shop at, and I've only had to complain about the strawberries here at Sunflower.  All other fruits and the veggies were fine.  Wish I could say the same about the other farmer's market whose name rhymes with snouts...  Don't know if this place still sells Berto's gelato and Laloo's goat milk ice cream as it's been close to a year since I last purchased, but you must check these items out as they taste out-of-this-world!  The prices are also very wallet-friendly compared to AJ's, but really, that goes without saying, doesn't it?

Visited Sunflower last night in search of Scharffen Berger chocolates.  Nay on SB chocs, but you may find organic (Green &amp; Black's, Love, Newman's Own, etc.) in the impulse buy sections.  I sampled a peanut milk chocolate cluster and an almond chocolate cluster at the bulk section and decided I'd get some peanut ones.  I already had a plastic bag open and was about to jot down the item number on a label twisty-tie when I spotted something moving at the corner of my eye... I lifted the peanut chocolate cluster bin lid to have a look, and there was a 1/2- inch maggot doing its dance on one of the bin's walls!!  I dropped the lid shut, stared at the bugger to see if I wasn't just seeing things, lifted the lid back up and pinched it off the bin's wall with the plastic bag in hand, and handed the bag to a clerk and told him where I found it.  The manager on duty was close by so I repeated everything that transpired to her.  She said she'd empty and sanitize the bin immediately.  I didn't hang around to see if she did anything.  Ugh!  I'm getting shivers up and down my spine typing this just now!!    BTW, I had a look into the freezer aisles a few weeks ago to have a look at the Berto gelato selections and they ALL have a horrible case of freezer burn.  Looks like a pretty low turnover rate...  I'll try to see if Sunflower still carries Laloo goatmilk ice cream, but, honestly, I can't see myself going there anytime soon after the maggot incident... --- Update: Just recalled that Sunflower never sold Laloo... I found Laloo's goatmilk ice cream at Whole Foods and AJ's Fine Foods.  Sorry for misleading!

Went once, many, many moons ago.  Had a great server, and I regret to have forgotten his name.  Too bad, 'cause he was a cutie...  Ordered a medium spinach pie w/ original white flour crust (Mom's favorite) and a medium whole-wheat thin-crust Marguerite for us to share.  (I always try to order whole-wheat, 'cause if I don't, I feel so guilty having pizzas, and guilt is never a welcomed guest to any meal gathering!)  We also ordered a small salad to share, and our awesome server did not hesitate to bring more salad upon request!    The beautiful pizzas took about 15 minutes to arrive, but the Marguerite pie looked tiny compared to the spinach, and when we mentioned it to the server, he didn't even skip a beat.  He agreed that the pie looked like a small, and less than ten minutes had passed when he delivered a larger pie.  Fantastic service!  Great customer service, people, that's what it's all about!!  (Some of you would beg to differ, but I'm sure you have your list of now-defunct restaurants that served SUPERB food, but lacked great customer service.  Am I right?)  So, yes, if thin-crust pizzas are your thing, as they are mine, then definitely check out Nello's!  I've eaten at both Southern/McClintock and Guadalupe/Alma School locations.  I've tried the antipasti platter at the Old Town Scottsdale location, and didn't care for it.  I'll give OTS another try, though, and order pizzas so that I may give an appropriate review!

While there were about three customers being tended to when I arrived, business had slowed down quite a bit that there was only one woman waiting for her nails to dry by the time my nail artist finished with my pedicure and massage and started on the manicure aspect.  I thought that $28 for a mani/pedi was a great find (we normally make the haul to Ahwatukee for these services for $36), but I had to wonder if the foot spa had been cleaned before I stepped into it (I was hesitant to feel the walls of the spa with my feet, but did it anyway.... not too grimy, that's good).  I also noticed that the work stations needed paint jobs (better yet, just replace with new tables and new foot spas!)  I found it a little disconcerting that Hanha (pronounced hen-eh) had to stop working on me at least twice so that she could tend the register.  There were other nail artists around.  My manicure isn't top-notch (she missed quite a few spots), and the salon needs a better-moisturizing lotion, bec. my heels and fingers looked dry, but I've needed to have the service done for over two months now, and for $28 I really can't complain too much.  If I didn't need to be somewhere soon after, I would've asked her to go over a few spots, and I'm sure she'd have obliged.    I was going to say that I'd be willing to go back again and give K Desert another try, but thinking it over, I don't think I'd want my legs stewing in those black-veined white-walled foot spas anytime soon!

Good-quality food and very consistent.  My group enjoyed the chicken tikka masala, lamb karahi, mutter paneer (peas and homemade cheese in a coconut curry sauce), with basmati rice and aloo paratha (naan with potatoes and peas).  Their vegetable samosas are pretty tasty, too!  Service could be much better.  We had to wait awhile to order the food, dessert, and then again for the ticket.  BTW, portions are pretty slim, but the flavors all but make up for the small portions.

11/11/10  Was in the area for a November OYE that was about to start in 30 minutes, but I was so hungry and didn't really think my second meal-of-the-day comprised of pie, cake, pastries, and wine was a healthy way to end the evening w/, so I decided I'd check out Red Devil.  It was dead inside (only a couple was there for dinner), and I got the feeling that most of the business that evening was going to be take-outs.  Bartender was friendly enough, until I started asking questions about the ingredients.  He still remained accessible, but the smiles certainly went away.  I almost stood up and left.  When the food arrived 25 minutes later, I wished I had left!    I found the calzone crust soggy- no crispiness anywhere, and the mozzarella-ricotta mix made for an ugly, bland-tasting (I detected no ricotta flavor at all) conglomeration.  (See photos.)  The only thing that turned out OK was the marinara sauce, but what good is it if the item you're supposed to eat it w/ isn't worth the trouble?  I had the leftovers boxed, and stood up to go after only spending 5 minutes eating.  After all, I had a party to attend!  p.s. What a poor example of a treehugger I am!  No sooner had I exited RD's doors did I take the first chance to throw the leftovers in the trash.  Should've just left it on the table...

I visit Ragtops weekly not to get my hair cut and styled, nor to get my nails done, but because this is where my favorite massage therapist, Andrea Chaplin, holds sessions at (she shares a room w/ another therapist).  I saw her weekly at SWIHA for about three years until she decided to rent out a room at Ragtops.  I tried seeing her here once soon after her transfer, but couldn't get over the perm fumes coming from the salon, so she instead kept me on her schedule at SWIHA until she personally found a therapist there to work on me (Jared Takeuchi).  I recently started seeing Andrea again at Ragtops and disregarding the occasional fumes that crop up, because the sessions w/ Andrea are SO worth the discomfort- half of the session I'm lying face-down, so I lose sense of smell for awhile anyway, due to the congestion that builds from the extra circulation that massage stirs up!  LOL    Cash or check only, please.  She does give out receipts, which you can turn into your insurance/flex-pay accounts for reimbursements.  The two stars are for the salon, but I give Andrea Chaplin MORE THAN FIVE STARS!!!

11/13/10  Don't ever come here!!    Should've known better than to stay and try the food,  after having to wait several minutes before being greeted by our server (the restaurant was empty except for seated employees about to have a meal); It took more than ten minutes before we were given glasses of water.  Service was very slow (the noodles arrived first, and that was half an hour or more after we arrived); our server was surly, almost to the point of rudeness; and my nephew and I even checked out the aquarium there-- it was almost void of live fish (maybe one swimming), w/ dead fish and excrement floating in the cloudy water.  NASTY!  But (and there's always a "but" in these kinds of reviews, isn't there?) we were starving... Next time, I will insist on going somewhere else, especially when there are many signs telling us to!  (Funnily enough, the restroom here wasn't that bad...  I'm thinking maybe not many people came to eat here, so the restrooms aren't used much?  LOL)  Total bill was just under $50, w/ minimal tip.  Food included about six dim sum plates, a beef stir-fry, lo mein noodles, tea, and water.  The only item all of us liked here (Mom, sister, my nephew, and me) were the noodles!  The beef stir-fry was the only thing I thought was palatable, w/ some of the meat tougher than the others.  (Don't even get me started on the dim sum fillings!) I'd never recommend this place for dim sum to anyone!    I wouldn't be surprised to hear this place closing down very soon, if it isn't already. What a horrible experience.  :(

Clean and bright, and within walking distance (1.5 miles one-way).  I like that I can find whole wheat pita pockets here, as well as the occasional bunch of organic bananas.  I also found Horizon-brand organic egg nog in the milk/egg section!  (Not as good as Clover-brand, but it'll do in a pinch.)   Even though there weren't many customers in the grocery store at the time of my last visit, it was nice to see more than two register lanes were open (I thought I saw three w/ lights on),  as well as six self-scanning stations available.    One of these days I'm going to have to check out sushi at neighbor Tanaka...

Don't know why I haven't reviewed this place till now...  I've had good pancake breakfasts here before, and since it's been a couple of months (or more) since my last visit, I decided I'd stop by this past Monday since Mondays are double-stamp days at the Central Ave. location.  Restaurant was clean and bright.  Restroom counter needed to be wiped down.  Employees were warm and friendly.  My one whole-wheat pancake with glazed pecans took 15 minutes to arrive, which I thought was a little too long, but it did look like there were many diners at that time.  I've had better-looking pancakes at this location before (as in wider portions), so this morning's platter was disappointing (please read my review of Dobson location and refer to photo for size comparison).  My server did offer to have another pancake made if I needed it, which I thought was a nice gesture.  Had I the time to wait for the second piece, I may have accepted...    http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-phoenix-2?select=ajinBMQBGbNI3yXN71_tlA#ajinBMQBGbNI3yXN71_tlA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-phoenix-2?select=1lYVcSu7Xj8d_UIHvCb0qw#1lYVcSu7Xj8d_UIHvCb0qw  I will be back soon to see if the inconsistency was just a fluke.

01/04/2012  I thank Yelp and ATC for giving me the great opportunity to experience a terrific performance of "Daddy Long Legs," ATC's first musical production, at The Herberger Theater tonight!  The two-actor (Megan McGinnis and Robert Adelman Hancock) musical, plus the invisible, but great assets, the orchestra and sound crew, entertained and amazed me w/ their execution of a well-written body of work.  It had comedy, romance, deception, and sorrow, to name a few... what's not to like?  Truly enjoyed McGinnis' impeccable timing, as well.  It is sad that many people pass up the opportunity to watch live theater due to the higher ticket fees, and I cannot fault them-- what's easier to bear: $37 per person plus $3 parking fee, which you may buy at the box office prior to attending the show, or $10 and free parking at the movies (well, at least when you're NOT catching one in downtown PHX)?  However, when you do decide to place the financial investment, you will almost always be rewarded w/ a highly-memorable night, believe you me!    I had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend "Daddy Long Legs" to anyone who enjoys great acting and music!  (Much thanks to McGinnis and Hancock for their lovely harmonies-- I cherished them!)

I really like this museum.  Every time I visit, I tell myself "I should come here every week," but I don't.  Admission on Wednesdays, between 5p and 9p, are free, which is the day I usually go.    FYI, I read in a flyer somewhere that if you're a Bank of America customer, you can get in for free on the first weekend of each month.  Good to know!  There are a few pieces I always visit, and I'm glad they're on permanent display here!  On one of my previous visits with an aunt in tow, we were able to see a few complete- to almost-complete Samurai warrior attire-- serendipity indeed, as one of her sons is an expert (of sorts) on Samurai culture, WWII swords (many have been retrieved on Philippine fields), and a martial arts aficionado (both of her sons took Kung Fu for many years, and the sword-enthusiast regularly visits Korean and Japanese dojos!).

I thought it might be time to update my review.  I have posted dozens of photos of my visits to PMA, and I never get to see everything I want to see in one visit!  I like to putter around for hours, looking at objects from different angles, and reading the blurbs of information that go along with them.  I always intend to return every week, so I always plan on going Wednesday nights (when admission is free from 5 pm to 9 pm), but life doesn't comply sometimes, so I decided I'd buy a membership so that I may come and go whenever I please!  If you're a putterer like me, and dislike ruminating among crowds of people, then plan on visiting during the week, especially on Wednesdays, because that is the day when the museum closes late!  Thursday hours allow you only until 5 pm...  I also know that the first weekend of every month is free admission weekend for Bank of America customers (just show your credit/debit card as proof), so unless you plan on taking advantage of that deal, you may want to stay away on those weekends, as I'm sure that draws in larger crowds.  I'm not positive, but I think First Fridays may mean something special for visitors to the museum, as well.    For those who'd like to walk around unencumbered by purses/bags, items of clothing, and other things that you may be carrying with you, because it's just too hot to leave them in the car, you may use the lockers situated to the left of the entrance, free of charge!  You're not supposed to bring outside food or drink, since there's the restaurant/cafe Palette, so you've been warned.  Certain tiers of support allow you a 10% discount at the restaurant and gift shop, as well as access to events tailored to film buffs, social butterflies, and fans of art lectures and talks...  If you need a break from studying museum artifacts, you may find your peace either outside, in one of the courtyards, or at one of a few museum overlooks, which are furnished with leather couches and chairs.  Perhaps you'll be lucky enough to find one without people speaking loudly to each other, or on the phone...  Oh, and I just found out a few minutes ago that there's an art library, The Gene and Cathie Lemon Art Research Library, accessible to local residents, too!  It's at the administrative building, the Wolfswinkel Education Center.  I've lived in the valley for 13 years, and I just found out about this.  The books and other info cannot be taken home, but local residents may have access to these and other library resources during public hours, and for those who aren't residents, you may search for titles of interest so that you may know what to borrow at your local libraries, or buy at your bookstore of choice.  If the museum, its many courtyards, Palette, the gift shop, and the library aren't enough to whet your appetite for culture, check out the nearby Phoenix Theater!  It's on the museum grounds, and I always walk by it on my visits, but I've never had the pleasure to attend a show there (or maybe I have, and I've forgotten because it's been so many years?).  I hope to see at least one show this year, so I'll have to look into their calendar of events soon.  I am really looking forward to my next visit!  p.s.  Fashionistas!  You may peruse through the museum's online gallery for info on the dresses at phxart.org, under the tabs of Collections, then Fashion, then look for the link to the online gallery, and enjoy!

A visiting friend and I gave breakfast here a try before heading to Sedona back in April '08.  The salsa was very good.  My friend said that the chips were awesome.  I had a breakfast burrito (eggs and ground beef) that wasn't very memorable, while she had something similar with chorizo wrapped in a soft corn tortilla and smothered with a sweet red sauce.  She didn't like it very much.   I liked the wooden furniture that reminded me of the furniture found in every home back in the Philippines- dark, heavy, and many are engraved.  I thought the Native American theme was a little-off, but she found it charming.    Service was very slow- we sat waiting for more than ten minutes before someone came out of the kitchen to greet us.  Lunch menu items are rather inexpensive, so I may visit again sometime in the next few years...

11/16/11  My cousin wanted to buy a hard drive for me for Christmas, so she asked if there was a Best Buy, or better yet, a Fry's Electronics near where I lived.  I asked her why FE?  She said that she knew that FE did online price-matching.  Sounded good to me (almost too good), so we endured 36 minutes' of off-highway traffic and traveled 20+ miles to visit this Fry's Electronics' location in Phoenix, as we'd only visited the one on Baseline and the I-10 before.  Became excited as we approached the lot- this FE seemed a lot bigger than the other one.  Indoors looked brighter and more welcoming, as well.  We were able to ask one of the salespeople waiting in their station where we could find the hard drives, and we were directed to Aisle 12.  (It's good to note that the aisles are arranged ODD on one side and EVEN on the other.)    After spending about fifteen minutes looking for an appropriate-sized hard drive without a salesperson asking if we needed assistance (none approached us), we settled on a Touro Mobile 500 GB priced at $75 and change.  Cousin whipped out her cellphone and used an app to scan the UPC bar code to locate one online for price-matching and came up w/ $55 and change, a $20 savings- sweet!  Now, we just hoped that FE would follow through on their price-matching promise.  We approached a sales help kiosk, since it seemed like other people were waiting their turns there, but after waiting five minutes without anyone stopping by, I decided we'd just head over to the registers and wait (five minutes, or so) for our turn to pay, hoping that they'd handle the price-matching there.  No- we were told to head back and wait for someone to give us the ticket for the price-matching.  Great, after another ten minutes' of waiting, we finally had a young break-in salesclerk approach us.  We told him what we had found, and sure enough, after about fifteen minutes or so of checking things out on the computer and discussing with another salesclerk, he finally told us that Fry's Electronics would not be able to do a price-match.  (Was the other salesclerk a manager training this newbie?  Who knows?  We didn't, since the guy never even once bothered to introduce himself to us, nor look at us when we would ask questions-- he'd answer our questions, but would answer them while looking at our salesperson.)  20+ miles of driving, 45 minutes wasted at the store, and I STILL do not have a hard drive.  Do yourselves a favor, and avoid Fry's Electronics.  I will never shop at one, again!!

Took a few classes during 2003 and 2004.  Compared to some of the professors I had at a community college in IL, I'd say that most of the professors I had the pleasure of working with here were professional and solid educators.  Indeed, many of the professors showed true interest in their students and even guided a few of us into acquiring research grants and courses!    The classrooms are large, clean, well-ventilated, and uncluttered.  Computer labs are massive, staffed with friendly and knowledgeable individuals (many of whom are also students) and there are a few private rooms available (the cc in IL had many more private rooms, which I constantly longed for while at CGCC).  Science labs were nice and cool, and equipped with Macs (my first time working with these, so another somewhat-positive experience associated with this campus!).      Among the courses I had the pleasure of attending while enrolled at CGCC was a very fun martial arts class called Kajukenbo (a mix of karate, jujitsu/judo, kempo, and Chinese boxing), and classes were held at night.  I felt very safe roaming around this campus, day and night.  It's well-lit; stairwells are roomy, clean, and well-maintained; and security staff is always around.  Since I do not like settling into my car after working out for a couple hours, I found it convenient that I was able to use the shower stalls at the locker room.  Don't know if this was allowed, but I was never accosted.  The staff at the weight room was very friendly.  The college is easily accessible with the 101 and the 202, and parking is never a problem.  Inexpensive good eats are close-by (check out Venezia's Pizzeria on Pecos; downtown historic Chandler also has great venues!) and there are groceries nearby.  I truly enjoyed my experiences here, and typing this review makes me want to return and take classes again!

Long wait.  Ordered nutty pancakes,  Spied neighbor's great-looking omelette while waiting for said pancakes.  Tasted the cakes and wished I'd ordered the eggs.  Price-y menu made my mediocre dish even more disappointing.  Felt out of place here with so many well-dressed, salon-bed tanned people. Breakfast is my favorite time of the day, and dining here brought my cheerful mood down fast.

I've dined here three times, and each time was met with extremely slow service, which is disappointing as I've enjoyed the omelette, sandwich, and burger that I've tried here.    I like the atmosphere... somewhat eclectic with the paint colors, the paintings and decor, but seeing kitchen inventory destroys the experience for me.  Sorry, Orange Table, but I won't be coming back due to the terrible service.

Wow!  I don't know why I haven't been back; the food I had here was so flavorful!  But I am getting ahead of myself.  Even though it seemed like I was the only one waiting at around 6p, I had to wait more than ten minutes at the lobby-type lounge area.  Lots of institute brochures and menus were splayed on the side tables, and there was even a table displaying desserts offered that night (sans one that features homemade ice cream).  I thought it nice of the host to offer something to drink, perhaps wine?  I only had a glass of iced water, but it was still nice not to have to wait for a table before I could have a beverage.  I was finally shown to my table in the near-deserted dining area, and I thought it cool to see the student-chefs in their stations behind the counters.    There are MANY options under each course to choose from, but everything is a la carte (unlike the 3- or 4-course prix-fixe menu at L'Ecole), so this would be a great place to visit with a few friends and go nuts ordering a few plates and just share.  Do keep in mind that the menus at the Scottsdale Culinary Institute change with the seasons, so you may not find the exact selections I tried.  I had the mini-course of soup (consomme, chilled borscht- a first for me!, and tomato-red pepper bisque) and the pork tenderloin and three-potato hash (potato, sweet potato, and purple yam).  The soups were good (I liked the tomato-pepper best), but I did point out to my server that the pasta in the hot (!) consomme was inedible.  A trainer met with me and told me that the pasta is cooked al-dente, but after I attempted to pierce one with a fork and have it flying across the room in front of her, she offered to buy me dessert!  This elated me since I had been drooling over the description the host had given earlier about the strawberry shortcake the pastry chef just added to the menu that night.  But first, I must speak of the goodness that is the tenderloin and three-potato hash.  Four small medallions adorned a hash consisting of three different kinds of potatoes and caramelized onions, which were simply cubed and roasted, but looked wonderful in hues of gold, ochre and royal purple.  I remember wishing I could order a huge bowl of these potatoes, they tasted so good!  The pork was very juicy, and so tender- the saltiness of the meat and the sweetness of the potatoes were just perfect together!  Had the opportunity to try the shortcake not present itself, I'd have left L'Academie as happy and as satisfied as I could be dining out.  And yet, the shortcake (thin shortbread cookies with layers of fresh whipped cream and macerated strawberries) looked so beautiful on its plate garnished with balsamic vinegar and basil syrup (yes, basil!), that I had to try two bites of it... Balsamic vinegar and basil!  Who would've thought??  I LOVED this dessert!  I had the rest boxed up, but funnily enough, I had nothing to put in the fridge when I arrived home...  Just looked at the menus on www.dinewithsci.com and there are so many selections I really want to try!  Sounds like a great venue for a yelp event... :)

Arrived early to ask the host questions regarding my food allergies, and to my dismay, most of the seafood dishes were off-limits due to shrimp stock inclusion in the cream sauces.  Since this is a culinary institute, the staff cannot stray from the recipes and skills students must perfect in order to graduate.  Lucky for me, there were still a few items I could order and enjoy w/out worry, but I wanted to stay along the vegetarian path just in case Amber wanted to have a try at my dishes.  I was fortunate enough to have Christina and Amber join me for dinner.  I thank you two for taking time out of your busy day to meet me!  I also thank Christina for introducing me to Molly Dooker Cab.  I had a nice Chardonnay.  I must ask Amber which one it was since she also had a glass of it (C., do you remember what we had?)  For starters, we all shared the cheese plate, which Christina already described in her review.  I really enjoyed the manchego and brie on the buttered crostini with the pistachios, pecans, and grapes.  The figs and apricots looked wonderful, but they're on my food allergy suspicion list, and I did not want to risk ruining a great dinner experience with these two women at my side!  For our apps, Christina ordered the wonderful-sounding 7-onion soup; Amber ordered the salad special;  and I had the onion-wrapped ahi-tuna spinach feta salad.  I could have had this salad for my app, meal, and dessert!  (It also had lovely pear sticks and a sweet dressing.)  While Christina was satisfied with the cheese plate and onion soup, Amber and I had other plans!  She ordered the sweet potato gnocchi with a white wine cream sauce.  I had almost ordered this one, but the host talked me out of it.  I had a taste of it and found it flavorful and light at the same time, despite it having a cream sauce.  The white wine helped keep it from being too heavy or greasy.  I ordered the vegetable panini- roasted tomatoes, red bell peppers, arugula, olives, and fontina on pumpernickle with cilantro aïoli and gaufrettes as my side (very thin waffle-cut potato crisps- delightful!).  The panini was a hit!!  Amber said she'd order it the next time she comes here.  Heck, I'd probably order it again along with another dish and share with the table.  The panini and gaufrettes surprisingly survived refrigeration and were easily rejuvenated using a toaster-oven.  Now you'd think all that food was enough, but Amber and I had a sweet-tooth to satisfy, and that we did with the apple fritters coated with cinnamon-sugar and topped with a housemade vanilla ice cream, pecans,  and caramel.  This dessert originally comes with a vanilla-walnut semifreddo, but I had to sub plain vanilla to avoid an allergen.  I thank Amber for sharing this fine dessert with me, although we did think that the vanilla ice cream tasted a little off (I thought it tasted like it sat in the freezer for a long time.)  I plan to visit more often to try the other paninis and menu items.

03/20/13  This was totally an impulse stop, as I was only at the mall to check out after-massage bath bombs at Lush for me, as well as splurge on some shower items for my lovely Mom.  I'm glad I did stop by, even though I easily spent a little over $100 on some luscious gift sets, because now I know that L'Occitane's products are completely paraben-free!  Not only was I able to give her the wonderful and new almond milk kit Amande (hand and foot creams and a foot-shaped pumice stone) AND The Vert (Green Tea) eau de toilette, but I also scored with an aptly-named Spring Ready Essentials* travel kit- a sweeter almond oil-based softening shower oil, exfoliating Amande soap (with flaked almonds), and firming milk concentrate (body cream), encased in a cute spring-green toiletry purse.  I AM ready for beautiful beaches next to oceans of blues and greens!  There's also an organic (?) facial moisturizer I would like to look into on my next visit, but I find it strange that L'Occitane's US website does not include detailed ingredients' lists for its products.  If I find out more info, I'll include it here.    Paraben-free... I'm smitten!  And if I find an organic line amongst L'Occitane's products, I'll be over-the-moon!  :D  *I somehow missed the name of this cute travel essentials kit, but my brain most-certainly received the subliminal message.  :)

Thanks to Yelp and Lindsey F., I was able to attend Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts' Talk Cinema series and watch the thought-provoking film "Melancholia," starring Kirsten Dunst, Kiefer Sutherland, and Charlotte Gainsbourg (and an impressive supporting cast, as well!).  I will admit that I LIKED the film, even though people around me didn't.  (In fact, the more I think about the film, the more I'm enamored w/ the story.)  Last night was my first visit to the venue, and I'm impressed!  Loved the stadium seating; open-air feel; and its excellent video and sound systems.  The lobby was very spacious, which I love, and seems to be a nice area to relax and socialize while waiting for a show/event to start.  Since I'd already eaten before joining up w/ other Yelpers for this event, I do not know if the venue offers refreshments, but I'm assuming it does, since other art theaters do; I will investigate further into the matter on my next visit, which I hope will be very soon!    Te Vaka or Late-Nite Catechism, anyone?  One complaint: Leg space is a bit cramped.  Thank goodness the older couple in front of us left (about 3/4 into the movie), because I then could stretch my legs in front of me.  I'm sorry they felt they had to leave, but I'm grateful for the extra space!  LOL    FYI: The opening sequences (specifically the planet scenes and the music score) hailed similarities to Terence Malick's "Tree of Life," which I felt was too indulgent- liked a few scenes, but overall did not enjoy the film-- perhaps my opinions will change if I give it another chance, but truth be told, the movie was so long and left me feeling so distanced, I doubt I want to spend any more of my time on Earth watching it again!).  I think Lars von Trier, the cast, and crew did fantastic work on "Melancholia."  If you like deep and though-provoking films, make sure to search for this!

10/28/10  What a fun venue!  Steven Paul has almost everything I could possibly want for a day of much-needed therapy-- a cool cafe that serves good coffee and delicious food (gastronomic therapy); a boutique (retail therapy); and a salon (beauty therapy), all staffed w/ friendly employees!  I arrived early for my appointment just so that I could try dining at Crudo, the cafe/restaurant attached to the salon.  Later, while chatting w/ my hair stylist Jeff Brown, I found out that the chefs here used to work at now defunct Fine's Cellars!  I'd ordered the Nueske's ham sandwich, which consisted of focaccia bread filled w/ ham, applewood-smoked bacon, creamy mascarpone, and homemade apple butter (although mine was missing the apple butter!).  It also came w/ a side of Poore Bros. chips.  It was all so delicious!  (The focaccia bread was simply addictive!)  I cannot wait to go back to check out the rest of the menu!  After lunch, I continued on to see Jeff Brown, who was very amiable and fun to chat w/, and indeed a stylist who really seemed to listen to what I had wanted from the haircut.  He's very meticulous... so much so that I thought I'd take Mom to try him out, as she's one of those who always ends up trimming her hair after every salon visit!  While she didn't care much for the hairstyle I ended up w/, she did appreciate the skills that brought about the cut/style, and when I suggested I could set up an appointment for her to see Jeff, she immediately agreed!    I didn't get a chance to check out the clothing or most of the accessories at the boutique, but I plan to come in even earlier next time to squeeze in some shopping after trying out another meal and a cut and color from Jeff!

Finally visited Grazie this past Tuesday after years of wanting to try it!  A few months ago (perhaps a year??), I won a giftcard from a fave radio station, and I thought that I'd use it before Grazie closes like so many restaurants are doing these days.    Should Grazie ever find itself closing, it WILL NOT be because of lackluster food... I fell head over heels in love with their Cinque formaggi!   I watched the pizzaiolo knead and hand-toss the dough, roll it out thinly, and then grab handfuls of mozzarella, gorgonzola (sigh!), ricotta (sigh!), provolone, and parmigiano reggiano (oh!).  He garnished the pizza with a sprig of basil leaf and some olive oil, and then slid it into the brick oven.  Ten minutes later, after I took a couple of photos, I had a bite of my first slice of pizza (I eventually had three- no, scratch that- four slices!) and I could've sworn I had walked through heaven's gates!  If you love all-cheese, no red sauce thin-crust pizzas, you must try this!  My one grievance (and it's a big one!) is that the body of the crust didn't stay crispy for long, but that is understandable with all the cheese placed onto it!!  The rim parts of the crust stayed very crispy, though.  No worries- I concentrated on these areas, while I ditched the soggy parts, but there was no way I'd throw any of the cheeses away (well, ok, maybe the mozzarella, which took on a rubbery texture).  The leftovers reheated well in the toaster oven the next day- a good thing to know.  BTW, I was able to sample a few sips of three white wines before settling with a glass of Anselmi.  This paired very well with the slices of cinque formaggi.  Note: I had asked for table bread and some olive oil and herbs, which the server obliged with a platter of spongy bread, not toasted, and bottles of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I'm not a fan of eating spongy bread (unless it's Ethiopian injera) un-toasted, so I took the pieces home to toast them up later.  (They were really good with ricotta, Medjool dates, and some AZ pistachios!)  Friendly service; clean restroom.  Not a lot of tables, or space for that matter, indoors, and I visited around 4p, so it was practically empty- there was one man waiting for his partner to arrive, besides me- so it was very quiet.  I'd wager that this place can get pretty noisy when packed...  Ample patio space, though.  (Pizza didn't re-heat well at home.  So you better plan on sharing the pizza at the restaurant so that there won't be any leftovers to toss out the next day.)

8/14 Went for dinner.  Wanted to dine inside as it was still very warm outside, but the noise level there was ridiculous (and it wasn't even half-full!), so I asked for patio-seating.  Service from my server was very spotty- I only saw her when she took my order, the return visit to see if I needed anything, and at the end, when I asked for the bill.  It took more than 15 minutes to get the bill, and when she did arrive with it- I paid w/ a giftcard- the credit balance was missing on the receipt, so I had to wait another ten minutes before finally going in myself to look for her.  Had the Vegetariana pizza, which came with mozz, provolone, Parmigiano reggiano, caramelized onions, and roasted red peppers ($13).  Still lovin' the crispy thin-crust!  However, it seemed like the pizzaiolo took a light hand with the vegetables and cheeses.  I consumed all but one slice's worth of toppings and all the crispy bits of crust my hands could find in the very low-light surroundings (I apologize for the dark photo), and I didn't even feel guilty afterwards!  As I said, I rarely saw my female server, and most of my interactions were with the busser, who brought: ice water to me after I had been sitting outside for about 15 minutes, with my pizza order already placed 5 minutes ago; a candle when it became too dark to see; and table bread when I asked for it.    Three stars for the tasty pizza, even with such little toppings.  Had to dock a star bec. of the cheesy (pun intended) service from the female server.

9/30/10  I can't believe it's been a year and 26 days since I last ate here!  Well, actually I know why it's been so long since I last visited... the lackluster service and measly topping portions kept me away :(  Guess I should visit Grazie on off-hours (around 4-430p), when it's quiet indoors and the pizzaiolo is just happy to prepare a pizza to keep himself busy!    I decided to skip the Cinque Formaggi ("five cheeses") that I "normally" order (well, twice in the past, anyway!) and try the "Complimenti alla Mamma!," which came w/ tomato sauce, mozzarella, mountains of ricotta (LOVE it!), ham, salame, and Parmigiano Reggiano.  Grazie certainly knows how to win my heart w/ its thin-crusts!!  And just look at the amount of ricotta on my pizza!  Loved the ham and the basil leaves, but I really did not enjoy the salame.  (I'd wanted to omit it, but thought I might get to like it.  Pfft!)  Even w/ the salame fail, this pie was so good, it will keep Grazie on my list of go-to pizzerias... way to go!  Guess I'll see you next year, Grazie!

After receiving a confirmation email that I had made the list to attend the Yelp Elite Event "Dia de Los Muertos" to be held at Barrio Queen, I contemplated on getting a Sugarskull makeover, but where would I go for something like this?  I asked a coworker who did body painting and received a quote from her, but there was a question of whether the products she used would be safe for me to try, so I put the thought away.  The next day, I remembered that mall department stores offered makeovers all the time, and then I thought of Sephora's makeover stations that I never tried.  What a perfect time to do so, I thought, so I made the call.  The woman on the phone asked if I had photos of the look I wanted, and I said I'd bring some, and I asked for a time estimate.  She said an hour.  I made an appointment for 4:30p, but as it turned out, I arrived early and was introduced to Amber, who was to be my custom makeup artist.    Amber was very amiable, conversational, and excited to do something out-of-the-ordinary, which made the whole process of getting a makeover very fun!  I have sensitive skin, as well as food and environmental allergies that keep me from using foundation and many products, so I was nervous about the possibility of negative reactions to any of the products we were going to try, but the only problem I encountered was a mild itch on my nose- not enough for me to want to run to the nearest sink and wash off all the products!  The whole process took about two hours**, and Amber answered all of my questions throughout.  I received many compliments at the Dia de los muertos party I attended, despite the fact that attendees could receive COMPLIMENTARY makeup from an artist present at the party.  (I was even approached by a mother with a young girl at the end of the event who wanted photographs taken with me!)  At least I knew that I was using quality products designed for surgical patients through Amber and Sephora!  (Not to say that the artist there wasn't using quality products, but with party time constraints, I wouldn't have been able to ask her all I needed to know to avoid skin reactions.  All that had their makeup done with her looked terrific!)  I would like to schedule more makeovers at Sephora so that I may learn how to achieve certain looks, as well as try out new products, and I will ask for Amber again, or someone she recommends I try.  *Please note that there is a $50 minimum purchase associated with a custom makeover.  **Amber went above and beyond her duties as a Sephora makeup artist when she assisted in applying tattoo decals I had purchased elsewhere, as well as allowed me to pay for products there at the CM station, rather than have me wait to pay at the cashier.  I had a terrific time!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sephora-scottsdale?select=lzZbOl2eBlmKOTWqdvF1Bw#lzZbOl2eBlmKOTWqdvF1Bw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sephora-scottsdale?select=HBeoahPFcVAb4fOWXm_q3A#HBeoahPFcVAb4fOWXm_q3A http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sephora-scottsdale?select=VEWdri3QbWfQTv1ngN8Vbw#VEWdri3QbWfQTv1ngN8Vbw

I will preface everything I say about Kazmierz with the fact that my first and only visit was at least two years ago.  I must give kudos to an ex-coworker who took me here when he found out I liked wines and that I also loved jazz.  The wine flights, and the food that followed, were amazing!   It being a Thursday night meant that the Dennis Rowland Trio were playing, and anyone who has heard of DR will tell you that he and his band are truly outstanding performers.

One of the best dinners I've had!  I had the pistachio-crusted salmon, while my date had the puerco lento (slow-cooked pork).  Both were delicious!  Since it was my birthday, we also had the chocolate-peanut butter dessert.  Oh my!  The buffalo carpaccio app was also a hit.  I'd give it five stars, but the noise level here is ridiculous!  The ambience is a little cool and a bit dark for me, but still a nice  place to spend some time at, yet we couldn't hear each other speak.  I really do not find shouting conversations enjoyable.

03/02/13  Stopped by for Easter chocolates for the aunts and Mom.  We all love the dark chocolate-covered almonds and walnuts, but I chose a few truffles to surprise them with.  The male clerk that helped me today was friendly and open to conversation, which was nice.  He offered me the standard sample when anyone walks in (that is, when the clerks aren't slammed with helping customers choose and package truffles into boxes) and another when I was trying to find a coffee-flavored truffle- thank you very much!    The Easter-themed wrapping was cute, but a bit sheer.  I suggest finding a supplier that uses thicker paper.  Why bother with gift wrapping, if the recipient can see (no pun intended) what's underneath the romping cartoon bunnies and decorated pastel eggs?  Just a suggestion...  I like this stand-alone store, but I still miss the branch that used to be in Scottsdale Fashion Square, but only because the former mall location kept later hours.  This one closes at 6p on business days.

Needed a few silver polishing cloths and Tiffany sells terrific ones- $5 for the small (7" x 5") and $20 for large ("about the size of a kitchen towel"), although the large was out of stock (as of May 8th).  These can be purchased at the service booths at the back of the store.  Many thanks to Service Coordinator Jessica Sampica!

Came here for happy hour a few times last summer.  The huckleberry daiquiri is good, if not a little too sweet.  Good for a try, but I wouldn't order it again.  (Well, maybe one more time... it's so pretty to look at!)  Nice atmosphere, indoors and out.  It can get very crowded, so arrive early to secure a table!  The food served during happy hour is tasty, too!  The burger, named appropriately, is pretty big.  My friend's husband, a six-footer, couldn't finish it.  It looked amazing!  She had the quesadilla (can't recall the unique spelling, and the RR link isn't working so I cannot double-check at the mo') and loved it.  It looked beautiful with caramelized onions and so melty (a word that is more and more popular these days).  I tried the delicious green chile pork stew.  We also ordered the green chile mac 'n cheese.  Now, I've NEVER been a fan of regular macaroni and cheese, but I LOVE the version they serve here.  The textures in this side dish are exquisite, and the taste...    I've also had the pleasure of dining here for dinner.  My companion and I had the cheese fondue to start.  Loved it with the bread.  We shared a duck entree, which was very flavorful, but had a thick layer of fat (I'd say the fat layer was as thick as the meat underneath it).  Since he'd never had creme brulee before, I decided I'd order that for us to share.  Pretty good, but I've had better elsewhere.  Didn't keep us from finishing it, though!  I have not eaten here since Eddie V. acquired it from McGrath, so I can only speak of the food as they were prepared before the switch.  However, I have eaten at Pischke's Paradise for lunch after McGrath acquired it, and I have to say that I did NOT enjoy the green chile pork stew I ordered there.  It was much too greasy that I only had a taste of it at the restaurant, and I threw the refrigerated leftovers when I opened the container and saw the contents.    A coworker just told me a couple of nights ago that RF is his favorite Friday-night (which is actually on a Wednesday) hangout.  He said nowhere will you find $5 pours of Johnny Walker Red.  A couple of other coworkers said that the food is still amazing, so I may have to give happy hour and dinner another go!

Happy hour was hopping today, unlike last week.  Bartender Ryan wasn't there, but no worries, as Stefan was just as able and gracious.  I selected the cab to go with the RF "Big Ass Burger," even though I wanted to try the zin.  Did I choose wrong?  I'll try the zin next time.  Since I enjoyed the chile-pistachio bread last week, I asked if I could have the commercially-made burger bun swapped out with the new-recipe chile-pecan bread.  No problem.  Ordered it medium, no pickles.  By the time I had thought to take photos of the burger (I was starving so I dug right in!), the scene was a mess!  From the very first slice, the longhorn cheddar-topped patty crumbled into many pieces- I kept wishing I had a spoon to scoop them up!  No matter, as it was still a wonderful meal- loved the smoked bacon, and the chipotle mayo worked well both as a burger condiment and as a dip for the wonderfully crisp and seasoned fries (see photos).  If only there are more happy hour meal selections (only two, excluding the salads) for me to enjoy.  Guess I'll be forced to try the Huckleberry bread pudding with creme anglaise and vanilla bean ice cream next time... woe is me ;)

4/11/13  2.50 stars...  Visited for the first time today to have my hybrid car's oil changed.  As usual, car dealerships tend to be costlier than independent auto shops, but my last few visits to the dealership has left me very suspicious of how much I'm being charged and what services are actually being performed.  I decided to check Yelp for options and stumbled upon a review by a Yelper I met once, a long time ago during a vegetarian meetup (I think), and he suggested I look up a valley car care radio and TV personality Mark Salem's website.  On it, I found a few shops that can service both our Toyota hybrid models.  After a few emails with a couple of Scottsdale shops' managers, I decided to try Whitey's.  The other shop gave me a quote for a complete maintenance service ($$$) that was almost as much as what I'd pay at the dealership, whereas Whitey's general manager Scott Almhjell gave me the option of just getting an oil change, which includes an inspection that would then tell me if the car needed more work.  (Our hybrid models' oil only needs to be changed every 10K miles, instead of the standard car model's usual 5K req.)  I'm now wondering if I should've just gone with the other shop to get the full service, as I don't want to skimp now, and pay heavily later.  I suppose I would've left a lot happier had the shop washed my car.  I wasn't EXPECTING that Whitey's would do so, but excellent customer service usually gets the customer to return.  I know that the dealership would've done so, but I also understand that the dealership has a Danny's Car Wash next door to it.  I very much appreciated that my contact at the shop, named Sean, had someone available (Alex) to drop me off at the restaurant of my choice, less than a mile away, so that I could have breakfast while the car was being worked on, and that I was able to enjoy a nice, long stroll around Civic Plaza before calling the shop so that I may get a ride back.  There certainly was ample time to wash the car, and this would certainly have created the warm buzz of positivity about taking my business here and would've guaranteed my return for another service, possibly one that would cost a couple of Benjamin Franklins and change, instead of the $35 plus tax that I was charged for today's oil change.  I'm omitting an observation I made when I returned to my car after I'd paid for the service, because I don't want to seem too critical, and I was truly hoping I'd find myself able to trust this auto shop for both of our hybrids' care.  Probably not going to be a repeat customer.

As I've typed before (a quick tip), Brighton Collectibles provides great customer service!  I've bought four handbags from here since Christmas 2010- two at retail prices (Bree, a Christmas gift from Mom, and Valencia) for me to keep, and two at sale prices to give out as gifts to my sisters after they saw my Brighton handbags, and I've already taken advantage of the wonderful one-year warranty protection against damages and defects on both Bree and Valencia.  I've also had a pair of sunglasses fixed, since my wearing it as a headband had loosened the hinges and made the "temple" pieces expand outward, causing the glasses to slip off my face.  On a tangent, did you know that the scratched lenses of sunglasses you buy here can be replaced for only $5?  (Personally, I think lens replacements should be offered complimentary once a year for the life of the glasses.  Especially since the glasses have to be shipped out to an external location, as do everything else you buy from here that can be serviced, which you then have to wait at least 2 weeks before you get it returned to you, but $5 replacement fee isn't too steep a price to pay... for now.)    I not only value BC for the great customer service and product warranties (free as long as you send in the registration cards at purchase- the friendly BC reps will even fill out the registration cards for you and send them out from the store itself, so you don't have to do it yourself at home, or worse-- forget to fill them out at home, thus losing out on the warranty coverages when the products eventually need cleaning or repair!), but also for the lovely jewelry I've bought here, as well as received as gifts from sister and Mom.  Some of the jewelry have kept well, such as the watches, but I've had bad luck w/ a few of the stainless steel bracelets and necklaces-- some have tarnished and cannot be cleaned w/ baking soda paste and a polish cloth.   Granted, those pieces were from a few years ago, and I have had better luck w/ more recent pieces.  Oh!  I must add that I really love the black Fun House large wallet I bought to match an older black and brown handbag (recently cleaned that it looks brand-new!).  The leather used in its construction actually softens w/ age, so it just looks and feels better and better... At first, I didn't like the magnetized flaps, but I actually love how this feature makes the wallet less bulky- no metal clasps or buttons to fumble w/, thus more user-friendly!  I now want to buy more of this style in different colors.  :)  Extra!  Extra! If you can wait till February of each year to buy the BC jewelry you lust after, then you will be rewarded with a complimentary set of earrings (no matter what price!) for every set of necklace and bracelet purchased!  The set of earrings don't even have to match the set you buy-- a nice gift to keep for yourself, or to complete a set to give away, as you think about whom you want to buy Valentine gifts for!  ;)  p.s.  My older sister is so in love w/ the paprika Bree handbag  I gave her for her birthday!  She held off using it until this fall, and just the other day, she texted another thanks and that she gets complimented on it everyday from coworkers, friends, and strangers!  I know the warm fuzzy feeling, since I get the same reactions from my handbags here.  (I've even had women cross a room to come to my side and admire the bags.  They're really that wonderful!)

Love the lamb curry, palak paneer, daal curry, and mutter paneer here.  Atmosphere is perfect- beautiful decor, very inviting, and just a great escape.  I truly feel like I've gone on a mini-retreat every time I dine here (twice so far).  The sole reason I haven't been back is it can get pricey.  Food, while small in portion, is terrific.  Authentic?  Yes- you won't find beef in the menu!

Tottie serves up two of the BEST curry dishes I've eaten in the valley- the chicken green curry and the salmon red curry.  Rival restos would be Phoenix's Thai Elephant and Thai Hut, and Mesa's Palee's Crown.  The duck salad is pretty good, too.  My friend and I also tried a Chinese entree (the ma po tofu), but we didn't enjoy it.  I completely gave up on it after two bites (and anyone who knows me and my love for food will tell you that a very telling sign of my distaste is when I don't even care to take leftovers home).  My advice is to steer clear of the Chinese dishes (Tottie is from Thailand, btw) and just order from the Thai menu.  Alright, alright, just skip the ma po tofu.  You're welcome.

2/26/10  Came during lunch hours to check out the Thai lunch menu only to find out that TAF's lunch menu only lists a few Chinese selections.  Thus, after skimming over the lunch menu, as well as the dinner menu for Thai selections, I chose to go with the Beef Lo Mein, which came w/ a bowl of soup and an eggroll, and the Tofu Green Curry.    The beef lo mein was delicious!  Loved the thin egg noodles combined w/ veggies and tender beef.  Correction- not all of the beef pieces were tender, but I didn't mind since I also had the tofu green curry to contend with.  Took leftovers home for Mom and I to enjoy later.  Tottie's green curry has made my Mom a fan of Thai food at last!  (I haven't been able to win her over with any other of the Thai restaurants I frequent.)  She didn't like the lo mein, though.  Said that the leftover noodles were hard.  The noodles must've dried out in the fridge, for they weren't dry when I had them for lunch.  As for the soup, I selected hot and sour, but when it arrived, I could see that a thickener was used, so I inquired as to what was the thickening agent.  The answer?  Cornstarch.  And so, I had it whisked away.  I am a fan of homemade coconut ice cream and fried plantains.  It is one of my favorite food combinations, and wouldn't you know it, TAF's Honey Fried Bananas proved to be a great contender among some of the best I've had in the valley (Siam Thai and Wild Thaiger also offer great versions)!  The banana slices were encased in a light batter, fried, and then drizzled with honey, and then topped with a scoop of exquisite coconut ice cream.  Don't forget the peanuts on top!  What makes the ice cream exquisite?  Why, this scoop was chockful of real coconut ribbons!  The light crunch of the battered bananas, still warm from the pan, paired well w/ the cool, creamy, coconutty delight.  Mmm... you must try this sweet dish!  --- 4/16/10 I've been back with Mom at least three times since, as I've hooked her onto Tottie's Soft-shelled Crab Curry.  (My mother is so hard to draw out of the house, but now, if I want to be graced with her company, all I have to do is utter the words "soft-shelled crab," and voila!)  Do try any of the curries offered here with a side of egg noodles.  As far as I could tell, these were seasoned only with soy sauce, but they proved to be an excellent bed for the divine crab curry!  We may just have to pay Tottie's a visit tonight!

10/28/10  Came here for a mani/pedi after a hair appt. at a nearby salon.  Had high hopes since reading Lindsey's 5-star review.  Unfortunately, my experience here did not even deserve the one star I'm rating it!  After choosing my color and sitting down at the comfortable-looking massage chair, I saw that two women would be doing simultaneous treatments on me, and I thought "Fantastic!  This'll be just like my experience in Charlotte, and  I'll be out of here in no time!"  The process may have taken less than an hour (I didn't keep track), and I was out of there before closing time, but that's bec. they decided to call it a day and kicked me out before my nails were dry!  The retro blue chair may have looked new and comfortable, but the massage part didn't feel new- I could feel AND hear the parts move slowly in fits and starts..  Perhaps this was the reason no one bothered to turn the chair on for me- all of the nail techs at salons I regularly go to do If I forget to myself (even the one in Atlantic City that I tried for the first time did so).  I only remembered to turn it on more than halfway into the treatments, and that's bec. my back and arm were feeling fatigued due to my manicurist forcing me to lean forward on my chair (back curved) w/ my left hand painfully stretched and at a cross-angle to reach her as she sat at my right side the entire time.  (At the salon in Charlotte, the manicurist would move her chair from one side focusing on one hand, and then move to the other to work on the other hand, leaving me to recline back onto the wonderful chair to enjoy my massage w/out any inconvenience!)  I finally made it a point to take my arm away and lean my back onto the chair and let out a big sigh so she could see how strained I was, but I don't think she made the connection.  That, or she didn't give a damn!  I much preferred the pedicurist as she was more personable and was conversational than the manicurist, who struck me as perhaps not as fluent in English since she didn't even bother to acknowledge my inquiry as to where she lived in the valley (pedicurist first posed the question to me; I answered, and then asked her where she lived, etc.).  I also preferred the pedicurist's work on my legs and feet over that of the manicurist's on my arms and hands, but on the whole, I've had better cleanings and paint jobs at other salons.  (The manicure I received here looked like the work of someone just learning how to paint-- the coatings were uneven and overlapped many of my cuticles.  I could've saved some money and do the work myself w/ much better results!)  What followed next, however, was definitely not cool, and will be one more reason I could never recommend this salon to anyone I know.  After the treatments ended, I sat at the chair waiting for my nails to air-dry slowly in barely-cool comfort-- there weren't any UV-light machines to help set the coats.  There weren't even any of those mini-fans to help the nails dry.  The tropical feel of the place (Asian decor-- ceiling fans w/ blades that look like hand fans; wooden panel screens w/ Japanese flora and fauna depictions; bamboo trees here and there) and the sleepy rhythm of the overhead fans made me reminisce back to childhood days in Manila, specifically to siesta time, when all you could hear is the whirring noises of the fan's blades and head as it rotated from side to side, and I was actually beginning to feel warm and fuzzy.  I was lulled back to the present when everyone seemed to be gathering their clothes and bags and lowering blinds down.  I commented that it must be time to go home as I looked at my watch (5:30p) and asked, "but don't you close at 6?".  A third woman chuckled and said yes, but business was very slow, so they were going to close early.  I've visited other salons when it was near closing time, but I never once was kicked out.  I've even stayed past closing and watched them clean up shop, bec. they cared enough about the quality of their work to make sure that I left w/ dry nails.  The women at  Queen's Nails would not show me this courtesy, and I find that completely disgraceful.    My suggestion is to skip this salon and go somewhere else where your body AND your money will be treated w/ more respect!

Kyoto is one of my two favorite sushi venues in the valley (the other being Sakana).  Very good sushi, great portions, and decent prices.  I like how it's never about "the scene" here.

Two exhibits ending 5/4/14, Leslie Shows: Surfacing and The Five Senses-- check them out before it's too late!  Leslie Shows: Surfacing  I am all about textures, so these "paintings" of hers, which incorporate metal shavings, plastics, glass, injected rubber, and glue, among other things, kept my interest for quite awhile.  It took a bit of time for me to "turn off" the world I left outside and appreciate these pieces, especially with music and scents wafting in from the museum's second exhibit.  (If you go, you'll know what I mean.)  I'd say I went around the room a few times- gazed here and there; read some captions; noted a few textures; appreciated the colors used; wished I could touch; read a few more captions, and then re-visited those I was more interested in and studied them more thoroughly.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smoca-scottsdale-museum-of-contemporary-art-scottsdale?select=49fNbauySXwsaXdphxk6Qg#49fNbauySXwsaXdphxk6Qg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smoca-scottsdale-museum-of-contemporary-art-scottsdale?select=zSDe_M4UQxhkwv0pVmd9Cg#zSDe_M4UQxhkwv0pVmd9Cg  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smoca-scottsdale-museum-of-contemporary-art-scottsdale?select=gO52ct69p5hUN5BHH7wM3A#gO52ct69p5hUN5BHH7wM3A  The Five Senses  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smoca-scottsdale-museum-of-contemporary-art-scottsdale?select=KeCpM59W6RQ54RWnFwywTg#KeCpM59W6RQ54RWnFwywTg  Janet Cardiff: The Forty Part Motet  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smoca-scottsdale-museum-of-contemporary-art-scottsdale?select=nn-0c-R8EcupoT5b4dBcmA#nn-0c-R8EcupoT5b4dBcmA  Forty voices, recorded individually and presented via eight sets, with five speakers per set, in an oval pattern; designed to be appreciated as a whole and also as separate entities.  Brilliant!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smoca-scottsdale-museum-of-contemporary-art-scottsdale?select=jjHGrI2oizYyg26BF9-sHw#jjHGrI2oizYyg26BF9-sHw  Ernesto Neto: Cai Cai Marrom  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smoca-scottsdale-museum-of-contemporary-art-scottsdale?select=e8QfYIWAcKX5HkWZQwkGjg#e8QfYIWAcKX5HkWZQwkGjg  The source of the tantalizing scents that captivated me while I perused and ruminated through Leslie Shows' exhibit.  First thought that came to mind when I saw it?  Olfactory receptors.  The "globular" forms held turmeric, clove, and pepper.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smoca-scottsdale-museum-of-contemporary-art-scottsdale?select=391lQhCq57yvWqrv6mV0Aw#391lQhCq57yvWqrv6mV0Aw  Roelof Louw: Soul City (Pyramid of Oranges)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smoca-scottsdale-museum-of-contemporary-art-scottsdale?select=wen7Effua64EYLSry1Lp3g#wen7Effua64EYLSry1Lp3g  Loved the injection of orange this display provided.  It surprised me that people were helping themselves to the oranges, until I read the caption.  So go ahead, make mini-pyramids and pillars, if you wish, as you search for an orange to snack on while you check out James Turrell's Knight Rise at sunset.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smoca-scottsdale-museum-of-contemporary-art-scottsdale?select=WPRKEjCWsbSlRUzmfkLL7g#WPRKEjCWsbSlRUzmfkLL7g  Spencer Finch: 2 hours, 2 minutes, 2 seconds (Wind at Walden Pond, March 12, 2007)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smoca-scottsdale-museum-of-contemporary-art-scottsdale?select=Uw8Wq6ily0aK83IvxJAOSg#Uw8Wq6ily0aK83IvxJAOSg  Another brilliant installation!  I was able to relive my vacays in Oahu, Myrtle Beach, and St. Augustine- well, almost.  I will cherish the carefree moments I experienced standing inside the semicircle.  Try it for yourself!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smoca-scottsdale-museum-of-contemporary-art-scottsdale?select=nlvD1lyeOOaVoUHSTU59YQ#nlvD1lyeOOaVoUHSTU59YQ  Olafur Eliasson  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smoca-scottsdale-museum-of-contemporary-art-scottsdale?select=KNkrXqttUdbMC1K3YLupxw#KNkrXqttUdbMC1K3YLupxw  With a quick glance at the caption and study of a diagram before entering the hallway, I did not know what to expect.  I went from standing in front of the fans to walking through a blacked-out hallway not knowing why I needed to "be careful of the corners."  And then I gasped and saw.  And felt.    Finally experiencing James Turrell's Knight Rise, after all of these years, was the "night cap" to a very fun afternoon.  I thought I was going to see light travel down the room's walls, but I was wrong.  And boy, it felt great to be wrong!  :)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smoca-scottsdale-museum-of-contemporary-art-scottsdale?select=bmCv255SdopJJPb-ijTd7Q#bmCv255SdopJJPb-ijTd7Q http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smoca-scottsdale-museum-of-contemporary-art-scottsdale?select=O161wRi4Zs8nrstAPKOvDA#O161wRi4Zs8nrstAPKOvDA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/smoca-scottsdale-museum-of-contemporary-art-scottsdale?select=WOjqlBEAmjmYfeYXVTfK5w#WOjqlBEAmjmYfeYXVTfK5w  FYI, admission is free on Thursdays!

Are you looking for the ultimate cornbread?  Order the cornbread skillet (last time I ate it was $4 for a 5" or 6") and you'll search no more!  I began my ventures here on the recommendation of a coworker after I mentioned eating complimentary cornbread from Z'Tejas and the $2 basket at Redfish Grill and Bar.  I first started having one huge slice (you can substitute a slice for a side that comes with their entrees).  I then graduated to just ordering the skillet and having two slices.  On my next visit I had half of the pan (the server even commented how the meal I was having that night wasn't very nutritious).  I seriously believe that my corn allergy was aggravated with my obsession of Bandera's cornbread skillet :(  I was able to try two entrees on separate occasions before I went stir-crazy on the cornbread.  Bandera is known for their rotisserie chicken, so do try some.  The salmon is also very good.  For sides, the spinach and glazed carrots are nice.  The enchilada my aunt tried was also quite tasty!  To help keep your wallet padded, have lunches here instead of dinner.  The vibe here is usually subdued, with great-looking staff and clientele occupying space, but it can get quite noisy on busy nights.  In the summer, try to sit at a booth with the window cracked open.  So refreshing, and quite relaxing- almost like having dinner at one of your chalets.

03/07/13  Just passing through on a short walk after dining at a nearby resto-- my second, or perhaps third time here, and I've yet to want to purchase something.  Most of the items I found interesting are so expensive, yet their presentation is akin to walking through someone's attic full of relics.  Probably just a personal thing, since I really do not fancy shopping through clothing racks and bins.  A few of the items I've found interesting were either previously-used (gold-rimmed glassware with gold leaf rubbed out in areas, or incomplete sets) or very expensive, like the new and beautifully-hued table linens ($125 and higher!) I saw on this visit, or lovely decorative pieces with even "lovelier" prices (read: expensive).  I suppose that if I'm expected to spend a lot of money, then I would like to feel like I was pampered and just came back from vacation, and not walk out feeling like my energy was stripped away, without even a clerk pausing from their activities to flash a smile and ask me if I needed assistance.    If you have extra time and like combing through clustered spaces for a "find," do go and visit, but this is a Yelp dukedom badge I certainly don't want to keep!

11/30/12  I've wanted to visit Razz's Restaurant for YEARS, but could never get the timing right.  I met the owner/chef years ago and would occasionally see him where I work, so I kept telling myself to go have dinner at Razz' soon.  It's part his fault, really, since he keeps changing his business hours throughout the year. Nowadays, his resto is open for dinner on Tuesdays through Saturdays and closed on Sundays and Mondays.  For two or three months in the summer, he closes shop and visits Europe, and then comes back and opens on Fridays and Saturdays for a couple of months before operating full-on for five days starting around October, but don't quote me on this, as I'm a bit hazy on the details.  What I am not hazy on, though, is that the food I had here rocked!    While on break at work, I decided that tonight would be the night to try Razz'.  I called up around 630p to make reservation plans for 830p, but said that I most likely will show up earlier.  "Would that be a problem?," I asked, and he said no.  He asked if I would like to sit at the bar/counter, and I asked if I could just be seated somewhere quiet, since I work in a very noisy environment all day, so he said he'd seat me at a booth...  Wasn't too hard to find parking, and I finally found out why the place looks deserted from the outside--the "front" really isn't a front, but just a blacked-out window, and the entrance is in the back.  The restaurant is larger than I expected it to be, and I found the interior to be very inviting and, dare I say, almost seductive?  I liked some of the paintings that graced the walls, and some just didn't fit in with the rest.  I'd have to say that these "off" paintings must've been the ones for sale.  (I read on Razz' website that local artists' have works on display.)  One of the two hiccups during tonight's service was my first serving of bread, which arrived slightly cold and not as fresh as I would've liked.  No matter, as I ate the crispiest of the crusts, and left the rest in the basket and asked for a second batch http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ?select=wMHMwYLfMh1v9Ens1XxE-Q#wMHMwYLfMh1v9Ens1XxE-Q, explaining my fetish of eating just the warm/hot crusts to my server, who willingly obliged- I love that!  I also asked if I could sample a couple of reds before settling on a glass of wine.  The answer again was "yes, of course."  I felt like dancing, because I felt like I was getting great service!  A man arrived shortly to assist me in finding the right red, so I asked him if he was a sommelier.  He said no, but that he will try to answer any questions I might have.  After a few questions I had on the cabs and a blend (nothing too dry, please!), he suggested I try a sample of the Barra Mendocino pinot noir '09 ($15/glass), and I loved it, and so I ordered a glass to go with one of the four dinner specials that night, the Peppered NY strip with mashed potatoes, a sub of sauteed greens, and fried onion strings on top, $30.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ?select=Oped4Oy1UNJbQQMdKubWoA#Oped4Oy1UNJbQQMdKubWoA  I asked for it to be cooked medium (pink throughout), but it was a bit on the rare side... I still enjoyed it very much, though! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ?select=D8vynNUfwYSNgupa4nLvvQ#D8vynNUfwYSNgupa4nLvvQ  I must warn you that this was indeed pepper-encrusted, so if pepper isn't your thing, you might want to opt for something else.  The second hiccup of the night was that, while I mentioned an allergy to mushrooms, I thought I detected something that looked like mushrooms on top of the steak, but these pieces didn't have the feel of 'shrooms.  I'd say they reminded me of water chestnuts, but a server confirmed that they were truffles, which also made me a bit wary, since truffles are similar to 'shrooms... I decided I'd avoid any more bites of these for the time being.  The mashed potatoes were buttery-smooth and chunky at the same time- I always try to control myself when it comes to white potatoes, but these were hard to stay away from, and the greens had a lovely dark-green color to them, were melt-in-your-mouth, but had a nice crisp at first bite, and they tasted tantalizingly of roasted peanuts, even though I was told that Razz' does not use any peanuts in any of the dishes here.  The fried onion strings just added even more fun to this dish (the more textures, the better, I say), and I was loving every bite!  For dessert, I settled on the Triple chocolate torte http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K64Uw3a2Enh2MznpwRHWKQ?select=yykeweLCsZcFrDdmivd8gw#yykeweLCsZcFrDdmivd8gw and a cup of brewed coffee.  Again, this course was exquisite!  It packed quite a punch of cacao, yet wasn't too rich- together with the coffee, I almost ate the entire slice!  I shall return soon, and next time, I'm sitting at the counter!

I've wanted to take Mom here, and she finally relented after all these years of saying no.  Could she have missed me after being away for eleven days?   She ordered the Peppered blue cheese NY strip, and I the Pork Schnitzel.  (Darn! I wanted steak!)  I would've enjoyed a glass of red, but she isn't a fan of wine, and I was tired from running around all day AND I also just came from massage session, AND I was driving us home after.  Mom really enjoyed the steak, cooked medium, with two sides- mashed potatoes and a vegetable bundle, while I found the candied purple cabbage that garnished the pork schnitzel, to be too sweet.  The entree also included mashed potatoes and a veggie bundle, but mine was missing!  I'd requested that carrots be omitted from the bundle, and when I'd asked about the missing bundle, our server said that the carrots could not be omitted, so I said I'd take a bundle, anyway.  More veggies for Mom to enjoy leftovers with!  Note to self: Next time, go for the steak!  The table bread and butter were d'lish!  Service was sweet and friendly- thanks, Candace!  I don't think Mom will be so quick to say NO the next time I offer to take her here!

Visited and enjoyed my experience here a few months ago.  Before attending the first of two "pours," I strolled around looking at, as well as listening to, bronze and clay bells.  There were also a few lovely blue decorating tiles of varying sizes.  I found Paolo Soleri's designs soothing for my soul, and his visions of architecture and ecology creating self-sustainable communities are very ambitious and some I hope to see come into fruition.    The info I learned from viewing the bronze pours and the bells made me want to visit Arcosanti.  I hope to pay another visit to Cosanti and procure a few bells.

09/14/10  My first visit to Ruth Chris' and I have to say "not bad, not bad at all!"  I really liked the subdued atmosphere- white-clothed tables, yet not too stuffy, intimate bar area, but still allowed for personal space; and music set to very low (great for conversation or working w/ a laptop).  Bartender was not too aloof, yet eager to answer any question when I had any.    Have you had a chance to look over Ruth Chris' HH (happy hour) menu, yet?  There's a lot to choose from!  Now that I think of it, I'm surprised I haven't been back since.  After studying the menu for many minutes, I decided I'd try the burger, which I'd like to say was $12 (or was it $9?).  Whatever the cost, it was worth it!  Perfectly-grilled and juicy eight-ounce patty, topped w/ a GENEROUS amount of blue cheese, some partially-melted (oh my!), on top of a buttered and grilled bun.  The burger also came w/ lovely and superbly-crisped fries!  Not a soggy one in the bunch, which was great in the short-term, but not-so-great for me in the long-term (so many extra calories I'd normally be saving by ditching soggy fries!  LOL).  A must-order entree!  BTW, I tried a little of the complimentary sourdough table bread and butter while waiting for my meal- crusty, good stuff!

3.75  First visit in years!  I could've sworn I'd written a review, albeit a year or two *after* my very first visit with Mom and her ex- back when I still lived in Chandler ('04), or perhaps even before that, in Maricopa (horrors!).  I remembered that he, a carnivore at heart, had the #31 Sultani,  while Mom and I shared the # 19 Chicken shish.  We also shared a hummus app.  I vividly recall thinking Persian Room's pita bread stupefying, and I'm happy to report it still is!  It was a hard decision to make- what to have for dinner, after seeing "Jiro Dreams of Sushi" last night (go see it!!), but I decided I'd wait until I could treat Mom out for sushi and to go to PR, instead.  I tried to stop by for takeout on Valentine's Day, but my last minute decision, made after a public speaking class and a whirlwind two-hour writing session at the college library, was foiled when I encountered a packed parking lot, so I headed home instead.  It was easy to find parking tonight, and it was nice to see takeout menus waiting by the first set of glass doors (there are two), where I could comfortably read the menu before going through the second set of doors and place my order at the cashier/host desk.  The friendly female host took my order of Kashk O' Bademjan (app) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a2ZBDIXmwBm7IWnXR6LK-g?select=A8dp3ThElnflQAyEU6LNXQ#A8dp3ThElnflQAyEU6LNXQ and #33 Naderi (from the section of beef entrees) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a2ZBDIXmwBm7IWnXR6LK-g?select=GJNTuFYve2kjaT5XqTDdCA#GJNTuFYve2kjaT5XqTDdCA.  Note that "all entrees include basmati rice, pita bread, and a grilled tomato."  I asked how long the order would take to prepare ("about ten minutes") and proceeded up the stairs to the lounge to read my book as I wait.  Or so I thought...  It was my first time up at the lounge, and it's cozy enough.  There are many two-top tables up there, in case you don't want to sit in the larger rooms downstairs, and the bar is comfortable enough to dine solo, or with a friend or two.  There is a TV for those who MUST watch sports as you dine with your companion or unfortunate date... As I've said, I was only going for takeout and was only up here to take advantage of the lighting, but silly me, I asked if PR offered happy hour, and sure enough, it does!  Monday to Friday, from 5p to 8p, happy hour discounts on beer and house wine ($4 glass instead of regular $6) AND a free app (hummus, hummus and eggplant, dolmeh, or yogurt and cucumber dip).  And so, I decided why not enjoy a glass of chard with the hummus I had passed on for dinner?  The pour was actually quite good, and tasty, and it paired nicely with the delicious sauce plate of hummus and a lone olive, topped with spices.  Hot pita bread followed shortly... I was blissful!  (Well, OK, I was very happy.  Yes, I was blissful, too, but that praise rightfully belongs to my lovely therapist at SWIHA!)  The takeout took a lot longer than ten minutes, but I wasn't going to argue, not when I was already full from my app and tipsy from the wine!  I hope to return more often!  p.s.  I did get to try a few pieces of chicken and filet mignon (delicately marinated, yet flavorful, and so tender!), with saffron rice (so buttery!), and another large piece of pita bread to enjoy a bit of the eggplant app with.  The entree was delicious, yet I don't think it's worth $21.95 for take out (see photo).  I could see paying that while dining in, since I have to factor in service and atmosphere, but for takeout...?  Ghaza aali bood, merci!  p.p.s.  Struck me a bit odd that I saw a lot of Asians, instead of Persians, entering and exiting the restaurant.  A bit surreal, I thought, but it could've been the chardonnay... :)

Great happy hour menu!    Ate here for the first time, and I wish I hadn't waited so long to give it a try!  Never tasted Tsingtao beer before, so I went for it ($2.50).  Very-light tasting, and refreshing.  Awesome when sipped after having a bite or two of pickled ginger!  I love soft-shelled crab, so I started w/ a spider roll ($6.95), and to go along w/ that, I chose a sweet potato roll ($4.50) and a two-pc. mackerel sushi ($3).  I hesitated placing the mackerel order, since I haven't had much luck w/ it at other places, so I was pleasantly surprised w/ Sushi 101's offering- it's flavor was bold, yet fresh-tasting, and the flavor and texture of the rice were outstanding!  From these first bites, I knew I was in for a great meal!  Tots, who looked too young to be behind the sushi bar, was my chef for the evening, and he was friendly, very quick, looked quite focus on the tasks he had before him, and yet was able to answer all my questions.  Definitely look for him when you go!    Next came the sweet potato roll- 8 delightful pieces of sweet-potato roll wrapped in nori, then rice, and then a light coating of toasted panko flakes.  These tasted divine even w/o its special sweet sauce!  Keep in mind that I am allergic to **, to name a few commonly used in sushi prep, so if these descriptions sound a little off, you'll know why.  Laying next to the sweet potato goodness were 8 larger pcs. of the spider roll.  I asked Tots to replace the * w/ asparagus.  Goodness, I can just kick myself right now for, yet again!, forgetting to take photos!!  Argh!!  These flavor explosions were exquisite to behold!  Oh... I, like Gen. McArthur, shall return!  You'd think that I, after the mackerel sushi and two rolls (light on the rice, please!), plus piles of ginger chased w/ a half-bottle of Tsingtao, would be finished for the evening, but no!  I went for the Alaskan roll ($4.95)- eight pcs. containing crabmeat, asparagus, and fresh salmon.  What else can I say?  I've found another great sushi place, and I cannot wait to share it w/ others!

After treating Mom and myself to both a relaxing and totally rejuvenating 90-minute massage sessions at SWIHA, we headed to Sushi 101 (my second visit, her first!) for happy hour.  We arrived at around 5:30p and sat ourselves at the sushi counter, said hello to Tots, who smiled and greeted us warmly.  As I've said before, don't let his young looks fool you- he's competent, he's quick, and he even has a great memory!  All it took was for me to say "No *..." and he completed my sentence by recalling all the food allergies I have to worry about when dining at a sushi establishment!  Kudos to Tots, and to Sushi 101 for employing employees like him!  Since I was dining again with Mom, I forgot to take photos, but I assure you, we thoroughly enjoyed EACH and EVERY dish we tried (well, all but one*, that is)...  Two bowls of miso soup- Complimentary, if sitting at the sushi counter.  Was surprised to find out that their miso base did not contain *!  I've had to avoid miso for so long now, that it was such a treat to enjoy again.  Lovely, rich flavor, with scallions and tofu, but a little bit on the salty side.  I'll be sure to have some everytime I visit!    Vegetable tempura; $3/2 pcs. sweet potato, 2 pcs. zucchini, 1 pc. onion ring, 1 pc. broccoli- We ended up ordering another serving, for a total of two dishes, $6  *Gyoza, $3/5 pcs.- Couldn't try these myself as they contained mushrooms.  Mom decided she won't order these pork-filled dumplings again, saying they weren't very good.  I noticed she ate all but one ;)  Spider roll, $6.95/5 pcs.- Pure joy! Rainbow roll, $8.95/8 pcs.- Sublime!  Volcano roll, $9.50/8 pcs.- Scallops, crab, asparagus, yamogobo, and smelt roe!  Served warm, and will definitely be a "repeat guest performer" at many happy hour meals to come.   Total bill $45.00, including 20% tip, for two people.  Bill is for food only, as we didn't order any beverages save iced water.  Offered to split a bottle of Tsingtao with her ($2 or $2.50), but she turned it down.  No biggie.  I'm all about eating my calories anyway :D   Again, if my descriptions of the rolls sound like they're lacking in traditional ingredients, you're not mistaken.  I've had to ask for substitutions as I'm allergic to many sushi ingredients.  Another reason why I love patronizing Tots and Sushi 101- they're so accommodating!!

Kudos to notary Chris who assisted me w/ all smiles and w/o making me feel like I was inconveniencing her (unlike the two notaries AND host at the Laveen branch).    I appreciate the roomy space that emitted positive vibrant energy, yet also made me feel quite at home.

I honestly prefer the food served at the Blue Nile.  Too bad that Tina's Ethiopian Cafe in Chandler closed- her food was the tastiest I tried here in the valley.  While I do like the environment here, I really dislike the slow service.  My first visit was for lunch with a coworker, and we both enjoyed the lunch fare.  My friend's beef tasted almost like Filipino adobo.  I had a veggie plate that, while flavorful, did not make me want to recommend it to others.  I've since tried it two more times with group members of the Phoenix Vegetarian Society.  Still do not like the service here.  I've always noticed that tthe servers do not smile, and it's like squeezing blood from a stone to start a conversation with the staff.  Tina and the servers at Blue Nile ALWAYS smiled and conversed with me.  Lalibela's injera leaves me wanting for Blue Nile's better-tasting spongy bread. My aunt agrees with me, as well.  Also, the portions here are less than the portions I get elsewhere.

How much do I like Green?  Let me count the ways...  1. Garlicky, cheesy artichoke gratine 2. I hum for your green hummus (I'd hum even louder if I can order this tahini-free!) 3-5. Crab puffs, eggless rolls, and samosas! 6-7. Jerk tofu and balsamic picnic salads. Tofu here is fried unless you specify otherwise 8-9. Thai peanut and coconut curry bowls 10. Thee "argentine" po-boy! 11. No harm chicken parm 12-13. Tahini coleslaw and those excellent thyme fries! 14. Peanut butter and chocolate tsoynami... Tsoy very good! 15. Vegan peanut butter chocolate bars 16. Proprietor Damon Brasch, who I had a secret crush on (up until he grew a beard!).  Accidentally bumped into him and his wife having dinner somewhere.  Sweet couple.   17. For sale art displays by local artists adorn the walls.  Pretty cool.    The only thing I would complain about is the long wait.  It's been a few months since I last visited, so I don't know if the ordering process is still the same: order at the counter, receive food at the table.  If you spy any of those awesome peanut butter chocolate bars at the counter as you're ordering, make sure you grab one (or three!) as they will most-assuredly run out before you find your way back at the front of the line.  I just shuddered blissfully at the thought of biting into one of these... But I digress.  The wait for the food is worth it, however.  Just be sure to order any of the items I mentioned above, and you'll do fine.  (Do your tastebuds a HUGE favor and avoid the pasta items.  I've tried the orecciete pasta, singapore tofu, and the curry pasta salad.  I detested all of them.)  Looks like Brasch added a couple of new items to the menu- ranchero salad and secret bbq chicken sandwich.  I'm going to have to get myself over there very soon to try some bbq!  Note: the mock chicken used in the wings is not the same used in all of the other dishes.  A good thing, bec. the wings we ordered were VERY stringy.  This happens when soy is frozen sometimes, I was told.  The Argentine sandwich tastes just like a Philly steak sandwich!  I ordered mine sans vegan cheese ($2 add), but I soon regretted that decision.  I believe Green uses Follow Your Heart vegan cheese (melts very well!), so the addition should complete the deception.    Do yourself a favor and stop at Green for a bite soon.  Oh, and Green runs Friday and Saturday night specials from time to time.  I once had a green sobi noodle entree (wheat sobi noodles with a pesto sauce to die for!).  I haven't chanced upon any specials after that (this was around Valentine's Day '07).  I've given up on their specials, but I'm always assured that they still hold them everytime I ask via phone.    They allow call ahead orders for dining in so that the food is ready to be devoured upon arrival.  Just be sure to time it well so that food is fresh.

4.5 stars!  Thanks to Yelp for randomly choosing a friend to give complimentary tickets to, bec. I was able to finally see "Fiddler on the Roof" after all of these years of wanting to go!  Even though our seats were at the back of the house, we had full view of the stage, and the acoustics tonight were very, very good.  The wait at the restroom was actually much worse BEFORE the show began than AFTER.  I really enjoyed FotR-- John Preece as the village milkman Tevye was hilarious and very entertaining, as so were the rest of the cast.  The Russian dancers were a joy to watch-- definitely one of the musical's highlights.  (You definitely do NOT want to choose the wedding scene as a time to run to the loo... the Russian dancing here almost had me giving the troop a standing ovation!)  As someone who's seen quite a few musicals, I was pleasantly surprised to recognize that FotR's "If I Were a Rich Man" had actually been the original work that inspired Louchie Lou and Michie One's "Rich Girl" in 1993, which Gwen Stefani did a remake of in 2004.  I also immediately recognized "Sunrise, Sunset."  Loved the sets and the costumes, as well... I heartily recommend this show!

I've eaten here a couple of times before.  The first time, less than two years ago, I ordered the chicken shawarma entree (complete with pickled veggies, hummus, garlic sauce, and pita).  Many of the chicken pieces were still uncooked that I could hardly chew it, and some were still blood-red!  When I started to complain about about this to my server, he acted as if no one has ever complained about the food here before.  He left, and he came back with whom I thought was the cook, who had acted even more offended about my accusation of the meat being uncooked.  He mentioned something about how everything is timed perfectly in the oven, but he offered to bring a new dish out.  Twelve minutes later (yes, I time these things), a slightly more cooked dish of chicken was laid out in front of me.  I decided I'd salvage what I could and just chalk it up to a bad day.  My favorite things in that entree were the pickled veggies and the garlic sauce.  Oh my... the garlic sauce!!    A few days after that, I brought my Mom with me for dinner.  We ordered the lamb kabob entree to share.  She wasn't impressed with the kabobs, since she had Byblos' lamb shanks on the brain (Byblos' lamb is pretty good, we think).  It was official- the hummus here leaves much to be desired.  However, I still thought the garlic sauce was fantastic!  Tastes great with the tabouli/tabouleh (both are correct).  Fast-forward many, many months to two days ago, I decided to order take-out for Mom and me- chicken shawarma sandwich, no pickle (tomatoes, lettuce, and garlic sauce in pita); gyro, no pickle, no cucumber sauce (lamb meat and lettuce in pita); and gyro with everything for Mom.  Why did it take me all this time to finally order these sandwiches to-go?  Both types are must-tries: the shawarma is a popular choice of many here, and all it takes is one bite for you to know why.  The sauce and garlic schmear combo is to-die-for!  And one would think that a pita with only lamb meat and lettuce sounds too simple to be so tasty, but it is!  The meat is so moist and tender, you really don't need any condiment.  Trust me.  Heck, don't trust me and order one plain and one with the works and judge them yourself; Most of the sandwiches costs less than $4 each!    BTW, you may elect to have whole wheat pita instead of the plain normally used.  You may also take Haji-Baba pitas home (made at the Haji-Baba bakery on Apache east of the restaurant); you may find them on the register counter.    You may pay for your take-out in advance and then wait for it to be prepared, or you may want to check out the grocery aisles as you're waiting and pay for everything at the end.  I suggest the chocoholics check out the Swiss chocolate bars here!  I've tried a few brands, and I just love the Milka brand: milk chocolate with whole hazelnut, milk and creamy white layered, plain milk chocolate.  (I love dark chocolate, but couldn't find one allergen-free.)  The flavors are so creamy and you can definitely taste the great quality ingredients used.  There are cheaper brands sold here, but a not-so-quick glance (you may or may not find English among the five or so languages listed on the back) will reveal that other vegetable fat, not cocoa butter, is used.  Go for the "good chocolate" brands; At two dollars or less a bar, you can leave with a goodie cache without having to spend much cash.    You'll most likely find something in the grocery you'll want to buy, so don't forget to remember to pick up your take-out order.  The chances of you forgetting about food, however, are slim since that is all you'll be thinking of the moment you walk into the place... the food aromas are mouth-watering!

08/11/10  It's a chain, I know, but what can I say?  I've eaten here three or more times now to know that the food's consistently good!!  Mom still asks me to take her here when she's craving for a great salad :)  I think I'll take her here the next time she feels like dining out...  Today I tried the falafel wrap, which also came w/ a great portion of a side salad.  Mmm... the salad dressing was fantastic!  The size of the falafel patties were grander in size than most of the others I've tried, and, more signifcantly, these weren't greasy or mushy, which could easily have been the case due to the servings' size.  The pita was slathered w/ hummus and topped w/ lettuce, onions, and the tasty falafel, and your traditional Greek salad (lettuce, olives, onion, tomato, and feta).  And all for a great price, under $8!

Had lunch here before attending the Dec. Yelp Hours at Cartel down the street.  $6.95 Green curry w/ chicken called my name.  It's a good thing the server took my order before I had a chance to wait much longer- the noise level was driving me up the walls!  Sure, it was during lunch, but I've been here during dinner, too, and even though there were only four or five tables going at that time, the noise level was high.  Veggie soup with tofu came in a small bowl.  Lightly-salted, fresh-tasting, perfect to get the juices flowing.  Soon after, a plate with jasmine rice, an oval bowl of green curry, and a small eggroll arrived.  Took a bite of eggroll and was disappointed to see * in the mix.  This is the first time I've seen * in eggrolls served in a Thai restaurant... Thai coworkers tell me that's not the norm.  (Another inauthentic dish served here is their pad woon sen- silver-bean noodles with veggies, tofu/chicken, and egg.  TB serves it dripping with sauce when it should be on the dry side.)  Curry sauce was good, but looked too watery and not silky enough.  Medium-spiced, perfectly light.  However, the noise level, soggy pad woon sen, and eggrolls with * will keep me away.

I love Indian cuisine, and Pasand in on my list of Indian faves.  Check out their chicken tandoori, different varieties of dosai, and vermicelli/rice pudding.  I've only dined here about two or three times, and I always tell myself I have to go back soon...

A coworker has been bringing in donuts from Donut Central for months now (since the last quarter of '09), and I've been meaning to write a few words of praise for their very tasty and light-as-air (Look Ma, no greasy fingers!) fluffly donuts that offer amazing great mouth-feel!  While I've sampled only a few varieties (plain glazed; plain chocolate-glazed; chocolate-glazed plain and chocolate donuts w/ crushed peanuts; maple-glazed plain and cake donuts; crullers; and solid and Bavarian cream-filled eclairs-- yeah, just a few), my favorite would have to be the crushed peanut-topped chocolate-glazed plain donuts.  The plain chocolate-glazed is a VERY close second, as I love the mocha-flavor the glaze delivers.  (Perhaps the peanut flavor overwhelmed my tastebuds so that I didn't notice the hint of coffee in the chocolate glaze that the crushed peanuts rested on, but I'd wager that the shop uses more than one flavor of chocolate glaze.)    It would be almost impossible for you to make a bad choice when selecting a donut variety here, if it weren't for the off-tasting Bavarian cream.  If you're looking for a delicious version, check out Bosa's.  (Too bad I won't be able to enjoy another one of those, though, as I had to endure a papule on my cheek for weeks-- one of many, less-painful symptoms I often have to suffer through due to food allergies.  Not worth it.)  Disclaimer: Don't know what the price-point is, as I've never had to pay for the boxes I've shared w/ other coworkers.  These donuts are so good, though, that I've had to ask donut-guy to stop bringing them in.  Coworkers who've invested hundreds of dollars trying to lose weight on the HCG diet had begun to wonder if I had a secret agenda.  Nope.  No agenda.  Just trying not to eat them all myself!  BTW, the jumbo croissants are d'lish!  They stay nice and fresh even when they're a day old!

03/19/10  Kitschy, fun country-life decor.  There was about a 15-minute waiting time.  Lots of older citizens waiting, which made for interesting chit-chat amongst the women.  It's refreshing when a restaurant's setting allows people to feel comfortable enough to interact among strangers-- Mom and I encounter so many "closed" individuals on a daily basis at work, so this is a nice change of pace for us.  Staff here seem friendly and busy, but efficient.  At least, ours was.  One complaint: it's a bit cramped in here.  It would be nice to have a little privacy from other neighboring tables, especially when I spied a room in the back that had maybe four 4-tops, and only one was occupied.  Can't recall what Mom ordered, but I wasn't surprised that she didn't enjoy it-- the menu description definitely did not appeal to me.  Website does not list a menu, and all I can recall is that it was an omelet w/ a couple of fibrous veggies (snow peas and something else; it was a strange combo, of that I'm sure of.  Chestnuts, maybe?).  I went w/ a Belgian waffle, two eggs, and bacon.  Coffee was weak, but our server offered to brew a stronger pot.  Nice!  While we waited for our selections, she brought out some mini-muffins to enjoy, and that we did!  We both really liked the bran.  I also enjoyed the zucchini-- Mom thought she detected cinnamon (not a fave of hers), but I think it's the nutmeg she was referring to.  Then again, I may be mistaken...  Waffle was, well, a waffle.  No accompanying fruit compotes or coulis to liven things up.  I always bring my own 100% organic maple syrup, because while most restaurants say they offer maple syrup, it isn't 100% pure, but a blend of maple and corn syrups.  (If it smells like Mrs. Butterworth's, it isn't 100% maple.  Just sayin'.)  Eggs were cooked to over-medium, just that way I like 'em.  Bacon was very nice.  Cute saucer and dinner plates, lovely mini-muffins (we bought extra to-go!), good bacon, and efficient service make for a solid two stars.  I wouldn't mind giving KTC another try, if we're in the area.  Next time we'll try the pancakes and crepes!

Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place, yet!  Went here awhile back on a hot and very humid August evening with a group of ten.  We had reservations for 8p- we arrived at 7p (as was requested by the venue), and tried to keep cool at the very crowded and NON-air conditioned Bar Bianco next door- very quaint, but the overhead fans and open windows were laughable- funny that no one was laughing.  Yes, we arrived at 7p and were seated at 8:15 and glasses of water were quickly given.  Orders for salads and pizzas were taken fifteen minutes later.  Salads were on the table by 8:45p and pizzas around 9p.  (Hey, I was ready to eat at 7p, so yeah, I was watching the clock!)  I ordered the Farmer's market salad and the Rosa pizza (with parmigiano-reggiano, rosemary, red onion, and AZ pistachios).  Fantastic salad- tasted very fresh with a lovely vinaigrette- the shaved parmigiano-reggiano on top was the icing on the cake!  I'm a thin-crust lover and was impressed with the pizza crust here.  Loved the scent and flavor of rosemary, and the toasted pistachios really brought the flavors of the other ingredients together and made them pop!    The server we had was courteous and aimed to please, which was nice to see.  Chris Bianco looked quite busy, and yet was all smiles, tending to the oven- another cool thing to spy.

I had heard about the beauty of this mall even before I moved to Phoenix- I was speaking w/ a manager at one of the stores in Illinois' Schaumburg mall (which is quite pretty and spacious, filled w/ plush furniture) when I mentioned I was moving to the valley (back in '03).  She told me that I had to visit Scottsdale Fashion Square (she had just arrived back from training there), and that I was in for a treat!    I do like walking through the mall- so many unique shops!  I sometimes catch advanced screenings at Harkins Fashion 7 (located next to the food court).  I especially love the water fountain staircase (see photo above).  I recently discovered that the Nordstorm Cafe here is different from that in Chandler Fashion Center- it serves pizza, sandwiches, and pastas, as well!  The heady aromas perfuming the air drove me crazy w/ hunger... I'm definitely going to have to dine here soon!

Visited only once, but remember wanting to go back.  Blame it on my ever-growing list of places to try!  That's why I cannot agree whenever people tell me that great food is nowhere to be found here in the valley.  Are you kiddin' me??  Tried a couple of sandwiches, and surprise, the veggie one stole the show.  Awesome durian shake.  (Note: you must know and love durian, or you may be in for a surprise!).  Take some baguettes home.   Cash only.

After reading all the hype about the Fez burger and sweet potato fries, I finally had my share yesterday afternoon.  I was supposed to meet a group for happy hour, but I couldn't wait till then to eat, so I ordered my first (and, as it turned out, my only) meal of the day at 3:20p.  Around 20 minutes later, I was enjoying my green salad with a fantastic lemon basil vinaigrette.  The Fez burger did live up to all the great reviews I've heard and read of it.  I can't say if it's better than Delux since it's been so long since my first and only visit to D, although it's pretty close!  I am a lover of feta, and the combo of feta, bbq sauce, onions, and pears (!!) on ciabatta was exquisite!  And the sweet potato fries...  one of the best SWF batches I've eaten!  However, I'll have to request for less cinnamon sugar (delicious!) on my next visit.  I cannot wait to take my relatives to try FEZ!!  BTW, I did return for a brief stay during happy hour.  I had to leave as space, though intimate and relaxed, was noisy.  I'll try to visit again soon!

8/13 Can't believe it took me almost a year to come back for a second entree!  I can still taste the delicious FEZ burger and sweet potato fries from my first visit.  But the important thing is that I came back!  I was about to order from the menu when I realized it was almost happy hour, so I asked my server, the lovely "Mrs. Fez," if she could tell me what the HH apps are, to which she replied that she did not know.  I then asked what was the Tweeter daily special, since I had not time to check it before leaving home, and she said she couldn't tell me since "we don't keep up with that here."  Huh?  Anyhoo, she left to alIow me more time to peruse the menu.  When she returned, I asked if the apps offered during HH changed from day to day (why else would she not know what the apps were, right?).  She said no, they're always the same, but that the kitchen may be out of a few ingredients so that the HH app menu may only have two or three plates instead of the five or so.  Since I still didn't know what apps were offered during HH, I went with the blue cheese balsamic burger, with a sub of sweet potato fries, instead of the salad.  I later ordered a margarita off of the HH menu.  Awesome drink, btw!   I happily can say I've had TWO great burgers entrees at FEZ!  The blue cheese balsamic burger was comprised of Angus beef, Danish blue cheese, red onion, spinach, aioli, and balsamic vinegar on ciabatta bread.  Just got the awesome shivers thinking about this ooey-gooey delight!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fez-phoenix?select=KrqEfWFk_p3PuTGbiw1tug#KrqEfWFk_p3PuTGbiw1tug  The female server had to leave, so I had a second server, this time male, who told me what was on the HH app menu, and I ended up trying the deep-fried goat-cheese stuffed pepadews. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fez-phoenix?select=ofK7s8IcW6h_NbOSk6Wjow#ofK7s8IcW6h_NbOSk6Wjow  Very tasty, although I felt that the peppers could've used a lot less batter.  My humble opinion, that's all.  Less one star bec. "Mrs. Fez" couldn't, or wouldn't, tell me what the HH apps were, nor the Twitter daily special.  And to think I alerted my male server that he'd given me the wrong table receipt, which only contained an HH drink and app, which totaled under $9.  But I like Thomas S. and I couldn't allow myself to wear that veil of deception.    So, when is the next FEZ Foodies?  I missed the last one or two...

I was at a Yelp! pARTy a few days ago held at the Phoenix Art Museum and was able to sample the meatball and pasta at the Mamma Mia stand.  They were freakin' amazing!  The pasta was perfect- so tender and creamy, and the meatballs... oh, the meatballs.  I didn't care for the cheese pizza offered (I'll have to check out other toppings), but I cannot wait to go for my first visit!

Lunch was a large antipasto salad, veal parmigiana (w/ ziti), and ziti w/ meatballs.  The delicious salad (ham, salami, cheese rolled up and sliced, pepperoni, lettuce, artichokes, roasted red peppers, black olives, pepperoncinis, and tomatoes) came w/ soft bread that made me place an order for garlic bread w/ the pasta dishes since soft bread just wasn't cutting it for us.  The salad would've satisfied the both of us, but we attempted to take it easy since there were two pasta dishes coming up!  (We ended up boxing up half the salad for leftovers.)  Veal parmigiana was my companion's immediate decision, but since she rarely enjoys the dishes she picks, I knew I had to have a back-up, and w/ so many selections to choose from, the decision was very hard to make.  So I decided I'd go w/ the tried and true meatball ziti.  Was I pleased w/ both entrees!!  Sure enough, my companion did not enjoy the veal parmigiana (how fortunate for me!!), and she told me to be sure to put it into my review that it wasn't any good.  I told her she should start a yelp profile so that she could make that assertion herself!  I, on the other hand, enjoyed feasting on both dishes.  The garlic bread was perfectly seasoned and wonderfully crispy!  Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!  (And yes, she loved the ziti w/ meatballs... Now I'm regretting not ordering a side of meatballs to go!  Oh well, guess I'll have to make another trip to MM soon.)  Even though I was thoroughly satisfied w/ salad, bread, and the pastas, we did end up sharing a cannoli.  She didn't like it at all, saying it was flavorless and was left yearning for a cannoli from Whole Foods (Ray/101).  I, on the other hand, thought it very good: the shell was crunchy and wasn't greasy-tasting at all, and the chocolate-chip studded filling wasn't overly-sweet.  (And no, I do not like WF's cannolis... too sweet and too vinegar-y, if that makes any sense at all.)  The venue's signage didn't impress my companion and immediately implanted the idea in her mind that this place was a "dive," but I was very impressed w/ how busy the place was, and how great-tasting the food served was.  I'm sure my companion would've come away w/ a more positive experience had there been a separate dining area w/ table service (and therefore not have to dodge heavy foot-traffic while we dined).  Now that I've visited this place, I'll be able to give future companions a description of what to expect when dining here: a no-frills walk-up counter best visited during non-rush hours serving awesome antipasto salad and great pastas!    Mamma Mia!  How can I resist you?!

5/2/13  Terrific lunch service today!    Parked my car and headed up to the door, but before I was at arm's length to reach for the door, a young woman, with a huge smile, opened the door for me and bade me welcome- what a great way to start my experience!  Was asked if I preferred to sit at the lounge or at the dining room; I said the lounge, and where it was nice and bright and a view of the outdoors.  Was greeted by my server, Oscar, who asked what I'd like to drink.  "Water, please," and a few seconds later, a glass of iced water was set down in front of me, and what else do we have here, but a basket of sesame lavosh and warm seeded sourdough rolls! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=EdJHPE7TO8Nc9bAmCMfrSQ#EdJHPE7TO8Nc9bAmCMfrSQ  I really liked how it was a 1-2 event- first the glass of water, and then the bread basket and saucer plate of butter next to it.  Awesome!  I also ordered a cappuccino http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=pG4X2QsqmIWrlOaUNRFKiA#pG4X2QsqmIWrlOaUNRFKiA, which wasn't on the menu, but I was told it could be done.  (It was delicious, with a healthy dusting of cinnamon!)  Loved the crystalized sugar stick that adorned the saucer.  I didn't use it, but I still have it as a delightful souvenir.  :)  Ordered the ribeye sandwich with truffled fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=qxlg0zW95M9Q-OJ8H-CY6A#qxlg0zW95M9Q-OJ8H-CY6A and a flourless chocolate cake. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=EqgjXTB2XBviaM_9U9hNVA#EqgjXTB2XBviaM_9U9hNVA  The ribeye was, of course, delicious, since it's one of the fattiest cuts of meat there is.  It was tremendously good during lunch, and I was content to trim off the fatty bits.**  The sourdough bread was fantastic!  Loved the outer crunch and the chewy interior.  The flourless chocolate cake is not to be missed!  It took a long time for it to come out, so I at first was expecting something very warm, perhaps like a lava cake, but around 15 minutes after I'd ordered it, out came a cold plate, with cold dense, and fudgy cake, with six luscious raspberries glued to the plate with raspberry glace and chocolate syrup.    Wouldn't hesitate to return to try other lunch options!  **Either I ate the half that wasn't "too" fatty (I'd say the half-portion I ate at the resto was 1/3 fat, which I trimmed off before consuming) and the other half was almost all-fat (maybe a fifth was protein), or refrigeration doesn't do a cooked ribeye well, for my lunch the next day was a bust!  If you're a petite person like me, or someone with a smaller appetite, I'd suggest you share this steak sandwich with a friend, wait till you have someone with similar needs willing to share it with you, or be resigned to throw away the portion you don't finish.  At $20, I'd rather put my cash to better use.

7/31/13  Took Mom here for lunch- her first, my third.  The manager, an acquaintance from a year or so ago, greeted us at the host's desk and greeted us a warm welcome.  I'd seen her here on my first visit a few months ago, so it was nice to be able to chat with her again and to introduce her to Mom.  She asked if we were celebrating a special occasion, and I said no, but that I did have a birthday earlier in the month-- it's too late to celebrate that, isn't it?  She said no it wasn't, and just to let her know if  I wanted to celebrate it, so I said "OK, why not?"  She said to give them a few minutes to get our table ready...  After a few minutes, we were taken to our table.  What waited for us was so touching, I had to take a picture!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=iIbKCsQjYDnsRh74ImLb2g#iIbKCsQjYDnsRh74ImLb2g  After asking for water, we soon gave our selections: Pan-fried calamari app, a wedge salad and a cheeseburger with truffle fries to share.  (I'd had the cheeseburger before, and I told Mom she HAD to taste it-- it's so good!)  We were hungry, and I noted that we were not given any bread.  I told Mom that this never happened before, but perhaps it was because we ordered an app and a salad.  (I had only ordered entrees on my first two visits.)  I didn't follow it up with our server Mike, since we had so much food coming.  While we waited, Mom asked me about the painted portraits on the wall- who were they of?  I knew one was of Frank Lloyd Wright, but I was not familiar with the other one, so we asked Mike.  It was of Barry Goldwater.    The food took awhile, but the wait was worth it!  Mike had asked if we wanted the app to arrive first, or if we wanted everything out at the same time.  We decided to have the app first.  We almost didn't order the calamari, since it wasn't deep-fried.  I thought that translated "soggy."  Mike assured us it would be crispy.  This dish was one of the best fried calamari we've ever tried! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=scjjRl12emUI2ACMbM889Q#scjjRl12emUI2ACMbM889Q  Perfectly crisped, not at all greasy, and the peppers were sweet, yet spicy!  The heat slowly built up, so we were able to appreciate the sweetness of the peppers.  Mom lamented that the dish didn't come with a sauce/dip, but after she'd had a taste of the peppers with the calamari, all was forgiven!    Mike came by to check a couple of times, trying to gauge when to bring the next course, so on the second trip, I asked if he'd box the calamari, or else Mom and I would finish it and have no room for the next two courses.  A couple of minutes later, we received our wedge salad, which Mike proactively halved and served to us on two plates.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=EpKlL89ya06lDOYlYAMiVA#EpKlL89ya06lDOYlYAMiVA  The veggies were fresh and crisp, the bacon bits delightful.  We bought enjoyed our salads, but I did find the blue cheese too bitter to my liking, and after a few bites, I decided to just avoid the dressing.  Mike offered to get me another, if I wanted, but I said I was OK-- I didn't want to get too full and not be able to enjoy the cheeseburger, and what a glorious cheeseburger it was!  And again, Mike had it halved.  Love the service here!  We ordered it cooked medium, and the burger was perfection on two plates.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=SZ4XU_VQnjg6-clbK4B6WQ#SZ4XU_VQnjg6-clbK4B6WQ  If I haven't mentioned it before, the pretzel buns served with the cheeseburgers are terrific.  If you like cheeseburgers, you must try this dish!  (The truffled fries are amazing!)  After three courses, we were thoroughly satisfied, but I asked myself, what's a celebration without a sweet ending?  Mom said she couldn't eat anymore, so it was with guilt that I ordered the ice cream trio and mini-cookies (choice of three, so I asked for vanilla, choc, and strawberry), because I knew she wouldn't be able to resist trying the strawberry. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=_f5dyKTQsNuetmEXlwvdOw#_f5dyKTQsNuetmEXlwvdOw  All of the desserts at Capital Grille are made in-house, and I thought I'd enjoy the chocolate or vanilla best, so it was a very pleasant surprise to find that I favored the berry, while she preferred the vanilla!  All three were very good, but I found the chocolate to be a little too gritty (ice crystals).  The strawberry was so smooth and packed with so much flavor.  Mmm... I wish I could have some now!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-scottsdale?select=bUO6oE_yNWQFJQmvv-Kspw#bUO6oE_yNWQFJQmvv-Kspw  I couldn't try the cookies, due to the presence of powdered sugar in the batter, but Mom said I didn't miss much.    We had a fabulous lunch, and what a great place to celebrate a birthday-- thanks to the staff at The Capital Grille!

I'd give an extra 1/2 star for the personalized chopsticks for use by regulars; otherwise, two stars.  Brought Mom along after reading such glowing reviews.  Missed happy hour so we ordered from the combo menu.  Too expensive for small portions.  Some rolls were lackluster, bland.  Fresher and tastier, not to mention LARGER portions to be had at Tempe's Sakana and Scottsdale's Kyoto.    Cramped seating.  Best to sit at the counter- I estimate seats to number around 8 or so.  Claustrophobes beware.    We won't return.

12/10/09 Finally had the chance to take Mom in to enjoy breakfast at MBB!  I tried taking her here once, but the line out the door was ridiculous; Even today there was a bit of a wait, and it wouldn't have been so taxing if it weren't so cold!  (We arrived at 10:15a, sat down at 10:45a, and had our meals delivered at around 11:10a.  Again, the wait times wouldn't have been so bad if my Mom wasn't due to be at the airline gate at 11:40a!) Mom ordered the 3-egg salami omelette and hash browns w/ cranberry-walnut toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ?select=-gdeqfSkpFBnCfkRo3Lcng#-gdeqfSkpFBnCfkRo3Lcng, while I had the ham steak, hash browns, eggs (over-medium, please!), and whole-grain toast.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ?select=OCEqJ846dKKtI2TLJ3mg5Q#OCEqJ846dKKtI2TLJ3mg5Q  (Let me just say that we both LOVED the cranberry-walnut toast!  Is it MJ bread or from Simply Bread??  I've got to get a hold of some to have at home!)  I enjoyed the ham steak and the hash browns were wonderful, as always.  Eggs are always delicious here- aren't they from local Hickman Farms?  Mom didn't enjoy her omelette so much- too much salami!  I don't like salami, but I tried a bite anyway.  Yep, I STILL don't like salami...  However, she did enjoy the eggs, after picking off most of the meat, and the bread w/ the plum jam. I'm always happy when my Mom enjoys herself at a restaurant that I take her to, so thank you MBB for helping her start her vacation right!

Took Mom for dinner Monday night. This was the second time I took her here, and it'll be the last! Guess Tapino just isn't for her. Out of the three small plates we shared, she only enjoyed the lamb kabob over quinoa ($9). It was the second-best dish of the three I enjoyed.  I'd wanted to try a glass of rose ($7), since Mom is a fan, but she was "too tired" to have wine, so I'll have to bookmark that for next visit. We started w/ the butternut squash ravioli w/ sage butter ($8; mmm... I adore brown butter and sage... My Mom, however, doesn't). I appreciated the sweet creaminess of the squash puree against the slight toothiness of the ravioli. The sage butter added just enough salt to the dish, while the toasted candied pecan bits on top added impeccable crunch! How I wished I had all three pieces! (She ate one and didn't even enjoy it! How infuriating! LOL)The second dish we tried was the baked escargots w/ butter, parsley, lemon, and puff pastry ($7). Compared to the multi-faceted ravioli dish, this was a bit disappointing. While I enjoyed the textures that the snails and crunchy puff pastry offered (TOO crunchy, if you ask me! Those babies were bordering on hard! Where's the "puff?," I ask.), the butter and parsley treatment fell flat. Mom again only had one. I believe there were 6 total. Don't misunderstand- I still ate all the rest... I was hungry!! :D  Last, but not the least, came the skewer of lamb kabob (3 pcs; $9) w/ bell peppers and onions, served over cold saffron quinoa w/ cucumber sauce (served on the side).  Thankfully, the lamb pieces were savory enough not to have needed the sauce. Loved the quinoa.  Check out the photos I took... I'll have to take a photo of the ravioli on my next visit!

9/29  Oh yeah, I'll be back!    So what if this place was practically dead when I arrived at 4:30pm?  And so what if it took me two times to ask for some table bread, which didn't arrive till after I'd placed my 2nd appetizer order?  Or that the glass of Primitivo Mediterranean red was a bit disappointing?  Oh, no.  I was captivated after my first bite of the Asparagus bruschetta!  By the second bite, I was knee-deep in quicksand and succumbing to sweet surrender.  Sweet, roasted red pepper surrender.  On a bed of creamy, luscious, and lust-provoking goat cheese.  I was so transported by this dish that I wasn't satisfied with just one... No, no.  I had to have another!  And yes, if you must know, I ate it all =)  Oh, and the table bread?  I sampled a thumb-twist of the honey-whole wheat, and it, too, was delicious.  I took the rest home, and I'm unhappy to say that not a crumb of it was present 24 hours later (no thanks to my roomie).

10/26/10  Terrific happy hour!  I'm almost tempted to give this first visit a 5-star review, but something's holding me back... Perhaps it was bec. I found it so dark indoors; How many times do I have to yelp it-- I like to see what I'm eating!!  When I'm dining solo and I can't take great photo souvenirs of my experiences, well, I sometimes feel "what's the point?"    I like this space.  Thinking back now, I wished I'd gone to the NYE bash held here.  Maybe next year...  Took Mom along w/ me, and I could tell she liked the old-style swankiness, too.  I must go back again, especially w/ such delicious fare and drinks and at such terrific prices, to boot!  We both liked our drinks-- mine was The Bramble, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-zuzu-scottsdale-2?select=zkpZJuIJqPU2bG8ahL7r1A#zkpZJuIJqPU2bG8ahL7r1A a short, yet sexy concoction made w/ Bombay gin, lemon juice, muddled and fresh blackberries!  Not overly sweet, and very potent.  I believe Mom had the Pomegranate Fizz, a tall, cool, and refreshing drink made of Smirnoff vodka, pomegranate juice, and sparkling wine.  Can you believe these were $3 each??  But wait!  Not only were the cocktails $3, but so were all of the apps we tried.  And oh, how delectable they were!  Mom's favorite app was the Spinach Artichoke Dip, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-zuzu-scottsdale-2?select=XBH8OmJtPaWmzy1Y7CLmhg#XBH8OmJtPaWmzy1Y7CLmhg which I found was too runny for my taste, but if she's happy, then I'm happy.  I was torn between the crunchy Artisan Grilled Cheese (brie, apple, fig jam) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-zuzu-scottsdale-2?select=jOMpMH4mpV6O5hfSUt1txg#jOMpMH4mpV6O5hfSUt1txg and the salty-creamy Prime Rib Dip (horseradish mayo, au jus).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-zuzu-scottsdale-2?select=k6Rq3e8zU8Xys5BJPE9NEQ#k6Rq3e8zU8Xys5BJPE9NEQ   The crunch factor I yearned for and did not get from the prime rib app, I found gratified w/ the grilled cheese.  Mmm... I think I've just decided where to go for happy hour after my massage appt. tomorrow!  LOL

06/21/10  I don't mind dining at a chain, as long as I (and others who may have joined me) leave feeling terrific about the experience.  Our party of four (three adults and a child) decided we'd try this place out, partly bec. of the glowing write-up it received in Charlotte magazine.  I was also excited about trying Mexican French toast, as written about in Charlotte magazine's "Top 50 Breakfasts!"    As we entered the resto, we immediately noticed the comely decor of a typical modern Tex-Mex venue, and as we sat down, I especially noted that the music was very loud.  (If you'd like to experience this yourself, first take care to find a nice quiet spot- enjoy the silence for a few seconds, if you'd like- before you turn your speaker volume to full-blast, then head over to Cantina 1511's website.  I dare you to let this go on for another 90 minutes.  I DARE YOU!)  As our server delivered our drink orders, (sis and I also asked for the margarita special of the day, which was made w/ Heradura tequila), our server asked if we needed more time, to which I replied, "I already know I'm having the Mexican toast," after which the others said they needed more time.  After the others had a few more minutes to look at the menu while listening to the loud background music, our server returned and took our orders- shrimp torta for Mom, steak fajitas for sis, and the French toast for me.  No French toast, except for Sunday brunch you say?  Well, I'll have the crab and avocado quesadilla, minus the avocado, then.  (And why the heck did you not mention this when I stated my intention before?  Oh, yeah.  I forgot.  Maybe bec. you couldn't HEAR ME due to the crappy music that blared above us!!)  After a few minutes of trying to bat away a persistent fly, our chips and salsas arrived.  I took this time to ask the food presenter (not the server) to request if it was at all possible to lower the music's volume.  (Hey, it can't hurt to ask, right?)  The answer we received is that more than likely our request won't be granted, "due to keeping up w/ the atmosphere, and all."  OK, well, would you please get rid of this pesty fly, then?"  "Haha, sorry, but no."  Looking back, we should've just stood up and left...  While I can't speak for the app myself due to a corn allergy, the general concensus was that it was A-OK.  The margarita, which sis at first turned her nose up to, was not bad after I stirred the beverage stick around a few times, which allowed the Heradura tequila and fresh juices to mix.  I'd asked if the drink could be made frozen, for future reference, but no.  (See a pattern here?)  As the tequila began to work its magic, sis noted that the music volume had come down a little.  Ole!  (However, the volume went back to its original strength a few minutes later.  Que mal!)  To make a "mucho terrible" story short, the food, w/ the exception of the fajitas and margarita, left us w/ much to desire.  Mom's shrimp torta was "just another shrimp sandwich."  "But what about the bolillo?," I asked.  "Nothing special."  And this from a woman who LOVES the bolillos from our neighborhood grocery store!  Too bad, bec. the pics looked good, don't you agree?  (This seems like the case w/ the cuatro leches cake, as well, but I am getting ahead of myself.)  Nephew didn't even finish his taco, nor the fries (and how he loves fries!), and my crab quesadilla dish was just three charred triangles filled w/ too much cheese and lumps of crab here and there.  Despite my trimming off some of the cheese, I didn't even finish two!  We all pretty much concentrated on the steak fajitas, which, despite the fatty content of the meat, turned out pretty good.  (And thank goodness it did, for this pretty dish went for a pretty penny... 1600 pennies, to be exact!)    Hoping to end the meal w/ a postre (Spanish for dessert), I chose the Cuatro Leches cake, which promised four types of milk in the form of white chocolate meringue, dulce de leche crema (condensed and evaporated milks plus sugar) and the fourth?  I think there may have been white chocolate chunks, but don't quote me on it.  Two words: too sweet!  Take away the meringue topping, it's OK.  Nada especial!  Mom and sis didn't care for more than a bite, and bec. I didn't really have much to eat, I finished the dish anyway.  If you're going to try your luck w/ this dolce- skip the canned peach slices and ask for more stawberries!  Or, better yet, just pass on Cantina 1511 and look elsewhere.  Not only did I end up spending $70 on a lackluster meal, but I was in a foul mood for the rest of the day due to the blaring music, not to mention the disappointment in not having the Mexican toast (French toast w/ sweetened cream sauce).  Nowhere was it mentioned in the Charlotte magazine article, nor Cantina 1511's menu, that this selection is only available on Sundays.    Cantina 1511 is no bueno!

11/12/10  2.5 stars.  First meal in Charlotte, straight from CLT's Douglas Airport.  This location is my BIL's fave location.  Replete w/ Cracker Barrel's large dining room capacity, its signature shop filled w/ old-time memorabilia and wrapped candies, goat's milk lotions and car scents, and a large selection of rocking chairs for sale in the front, this Cracker Barrel does stand out as having better customer service than what I've experienced elsewhere.  (We used to visit CBs on childhood road trips, but I could probably count on one hand the number of visits I've made in the past decade or two.)  Mom and I shared the Country Boy Breakfast (well, she had the eggs, a little slice of the steak, and some of the biscuits and hash brown casserole.  I tried to enjoy the rest, but the only item I appreciated was the dish of fried apples.  While the steak was flavorful (it was actually over-seasoned- this dish haunted me all day!), I didn't enjoy its processed texture, which came across to me as a chopped steak and not a nice piece of USDA choice.  The casserole was gummy, thus inedible, and the biscuits were dry, dry, dry.  I overcame my wariness to try the fried apples (which glistened from the cornstarch that thickened the sauce) just so that I could consume a part of a dry biscuit.  Ironic, then that out of the entire entree ensemble, all I can recommend are the apples.  (I believe Mom enjoyed the eggs...)  I did get to try my BIL's French toast special, which is your traditional French toast, but w/ more cheesecake frosting and maple-syrup goodness.  I found its sweetness a little cloying in the end, but I'd take this over the disaster that was the Country Boy.

Visited this library a couple of times prior to moving near the area 5 years ago.  Really liked the layout (five out of six floors are accessible to the public).  Can't recall if it offers wi-fi.  The staff that worked the checkout desk seemed very friendly and helpful when I asked for restaurant suggestions around the area :)  I became excited when one mentioned that a new branch was opening soon closer to where I would live- the Cesar Chavez branch on Baseline.  I thought perhaps it would be very similar to this 6-storied building.  I was truly disappointed when I finally did visit CC Library, as it turned out to be a one-storied daycare center for noisy teenagers and pre-teens waiting for their rides to come pick them up :(  I'd hoped to have more opportunities to check this library out again, but I may have to wait for Yelp to throw a party out this way to make a day out of it!

Visited for the first time yesterday (Thursday), but left without a purchase.  I had a few questions concerning some food allergies, but the clerk behind the counter almost didn't care, and it was almost like I had to twist her arm to have her call someone for the info.  I mean, these cookies are $2.50 a pop, and I've seen, and eaten, larger-portioned fantastic all-natural cookies being sold for less than that, and for a possible sale of AT LEAST two cookies (and Lord knows how many return visits I would make based on how much I like these cookies), the clerk didn't WANT to make the call??  She actually grimaced.  (Funny, but the clerk next door at Chill Out didn't want to call the company that supplies their cookies, either.)  Oh, well.  Their loss...    I had decided then and there that I couldn't, and wouldn't, go back to Tammie Coe again.

I LOVE Camelview, in spite of non-stadium seating and the awkward queue in the women's restroom.  I've enjoyed all but one movie I've seen here (Paris, je t'aime, and I only disliked those scenes involving Elijah Wood... not so precious! ).  It makes me smile to notice the broad age spectrum of audience members no matter what is on-screen, and it's quite refreshing to see and hear others be as emotionally affected as I can become sometimes!  *** Update:  A few weeks back, I saw the second movie I didn't enjoy here (and Paris, Je T'aime doesn't really count, since Elijah Wood's short movie was only one of about 16 short films within the movie), and the title was "Deep Blue Sea."  OK, so don't get me wrong- the acting was very, very good, and I loved the costume design (clothing, furniture, and props), but the plot and the story's resolution just made me almost want to pull my hair out!  I definitely wanted to walk out.  I'm surprised I didn't.    Please, please, Camelview-- I hope I don't get disappointed again so soon!

Harkins Camelview 5 is closing and relocating to a fourteen-room theater on Scottsdale Fashion Square's east wing by Barney's.  Last day to view movies at this 42-year old arthouse is Thursday December 10, and the opening day at the new location is Thursday December 17!  To commemorate its closing, Camelview 5 is showing ten "classics," at $5 ticket prices, from November 30th to December 6th.  I've seen all but two- Annie Hall and Cinema Paradiso, which I will try to check out tomorrow.  If only Amadeus wasn't a three-hour movie, I'd watch it again, but on the big screen.  (I saw it on DVD via Netflix many, many years ago.  I think.)  You may see the list of today's movies and showtimes (you may select a different viewing day, as well) here:  http://www.harkinstheatres.com/theatreDetails.aspx?theatreId=4528  Supposedly, a commemorative pin will be passed out with each ticket.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/harkins-camelview-5-scottsdale-2?select=idJweg3PoeOBUOzOm2cwaA

Love the food I've tried here so far!  Nice decor/atmosphere.  It can get VERY NOISY, though.  The pork torta sandwich (that title is repetitive... torta is Spanish for sandwich), which came with goat cheese and tamarind on grilled flatbread and sides of cole slaw and awesome waffle fries, was fantastic!  I also had the pleasure of trying my neighbor's Coconut ginger curry rice (w/ chicken).  Yummy!  Complimentary tiny dishes of dips and tortilla chips were devoured by table companions so I assume they were good.   Arrive early for happy hour or dinner or you'll have to resign yourself to a long wait.

8/11/11  Arrived early to meet a friend for happy hour.  While I waited, I ordered a Dark 'n Stormy, which was made with Gosling's rum and ginger beer and was very satisfying. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-pizzeria-phoenix?select=3I1MDsYqvtcSvZ1mEAdm3A#3I1MDsYqvtcSvZ1mEAdm3A  I recall having to nurse it, when what I really wanted to do was order another one.  We eventually ordered a pizza to share, the Fallen Angel, which consisted of local Schreiner's sausage, roasted yellow peppers, shaved fennel, and "premium cheese and red sauce." http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-pizzeria-phoenix?select=mnnAJU87MV0Skbk9d5xPVA#mnnAJU87MV0Skbk9d5xPVA  Very, very good!  Great thin crust, although IMO the red sauce made for a soggy pizza.    Guess we also ordered chicken wings, although I don't remember the experience, so I most likely didn't have any.    http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-pizzeria-phoenix?select=pwqkdvk8VnOBNmWaDH-uow#pwqkdvk8VnOBNmWaDH-uow http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-pizzeria-phoenix?select=XvbD54Sj8m2i6qSa2MxCuA#XvbD54Sj8m2i6qSa2MxCuA  I haven't returned, but that's because there's so many restaurants to try in this valley we live in!  I must go back before the end of the year...

8/11/11  After reading so many reviews about how great Maggiano's happy hour was, I decided to check it out myself and use a $10 gift card that Maggiano's had sent to me in honor of my birthday.  [Yes, I'm writing this review almost two years' later... I am that backlogged with reviews and photos- bear with me.  I don't think that these should be discounted based on how long it's been since these visits, because I (and others) could use these observations to see if the restaurants and their service and products have improved, or in some cases, worsened.)]    Was going to try a couple of the apps when I spotted the Four-Cheese Ravioli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maggianos-little-italy-scottsdale-3?select=GzMWRgNr3Im5eTXGK5rFiQ#GzMWRgNr3Im5eTXGK5rFiQ on the dinner menu.  The description mentioned ricotta, cream cheese, mozz, and provolone in a pesto-alfredo cream sauce, and I was hooked ("ricotta," "pesto," and "alfredo" hook me in 95% of the time).  Unfortunately, the dish was a HUGE letdown... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maggianos-little-italy-scottsdale-3?select=dMECY1zFqidngRglm1e3sA#dMECY1zFqidngRglm1e3sA  All but two of the ravioli were half-frozen (especially at the edges), and the flavors?  All of the cheeses, marinara sauce, and pesto-alfedo cream sauce tasted the same!  All bland, without any distinction between them.  I tasted samples from allover the plate, from all components, separately and together, and couldn't discern any difference.  Even the entree's appearance was subpar.  Suffice it to say, I have not stepped foot into another Maggiano's since.  The two good comments I could say are that the restaurant was quiet (no one was there) and the plates were quaint-looking, with that old-fashioned rose-and-bone tinted floral print.

Brunch here today was worth driving over 18 miles one-way.  Restaurant 's space was bright (large windows facing the parking lot and street), uncluttered, and attractive (shelf/bookcase with picture frames and a few knick-knacks gave the space a cozy atmosphere- don't know about the restroom as I didn't get a chance to visit it).  I asked if we were to seat ourselves, and I was told that we were to order at the counter and that we could then seat anywhere we wanted to.  I try to get a few suggestions wherever I go not only to check for allergens, but also for good customer service; it never sits well with me if staff members aren't able to suggest anything off of the menu.  After hearing a few enthusiastic lunch suggestions from the cashier, I placed in our order: a Belgian waffle with fresh fruit toppings (peaches and berries) for Mom, and a combo of half a Reubenesque panini and a small mixed salad.  It took about fifteen minutes before the food arrived, which gave us time to chit-chat and this was when I noticed the restaurant's surroundings.  I thought it cool to be able to watch the two cooks prepare the orders behind the counter.  My Mom LOVED the waffle with the fresh fruit toppings!  Her plate arrived with two 4x4-inch waffles, one with peaches and the other with sliced strawberries, a slice of pineapple and an orange wedge, all sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Mom sensed something was missing, and after asking for whipped cream, she and the waffles were fast friends.  My small salad looked beautiful- mixed greens with glazed pecans, a few pear slices, and blue cheese crumbles, a slice of grilled foccacia bread and a side of citrus vinaigrette.  My half-sandwich of shaved corned beef, swiss cheese, fresh sauerkraut on Acacia Cafe marble-rye bread looked tiny (Mom and I noticed the wee-portion right away), but it was full of flavor.  The combo was a definite hit with me, even though I did end up with a few allergy symptoms.    Kudos to AC for winning over my Mom... we will visit again to try other menu selections soon!

5/22/13  Placed my reservation through OpenTable a few days beforehand.  I arrived around 45 minutes earlier than my other table mates, so I used some of the time to check with the kitchen to see if the selections I'd wanted to try off of the RW menu would be allergen-free (for me).  It seemed like I would have some trouble with the dessert menu (I'd wanted the cannoli, but that was ruled out), but after conferring with the kitchen, the hostess said that the gelati and sorbetti were safe.  This initially anticlimactic for me, but boy, was I in for a surprise!    As I was making my way through the courtyard (boy, this property was HUGE) looking for the source of people conversing and laughing, I decided I'd let my friends know I was waiting for them, but they snuck up on me and was at my side before I finished clicking "send."  Turns out the large group of people ahead of us was part of a wedding reception, so we quickly tried to find our way to the host's stand somewhere inside the cavernous restaurant.  My friends asked me if this was a resort, and I told them that I only knew it to be a restaurant.  (On our way to our table, I posed the question to the host, to which he replied that Sassi was only a restaurant, albeit one that also held many banquets.)  We were the first ones seated at one of the rooms that had patio dining overlooking gorgeous views, including Pinnacle Peak.  We each were handed wine and dinner menus, but only one RW menu, so I asked for another.    Since I knew I was going to order the panna cotta app and the tagliatelle as my main, I decided to go with a glass of Arneis ($13).  My two friends ordered glasses of Barbaresco ($17 each).  I enjoyed my glass of white-- vanilla-scented, not too dry, and I loved the apricot and pear notes.  (I need to locate a bottle, or two, to have some at home.)  This glass held well through the app and main, as well as dessert, but I'm getting ahead of myself...  My table mates decided they'd try the other apps and entrees featured on the RW menu, so that we may all get to sample everyone's plates.  The Parmigiano and roasted garlic panna cotta app was lovely! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=5gIYqKU2DqAaD7cihhacxQ#5gIYqKU2DqAaD7cihhacxQ  I've had panna cotta before, so I'd expected something much lighter, more gelatinous; This was akin to a cheese spread- dense, creamy, yet slightly crumbly.  While I loved the garlicky crostino, I found it heavily dressed.  A lighter hand with the parmigiano would've sufficed.  Still, I enjoyed the app immensely!  The house made tagliatelle, with artichoke pesto and fava beans, dusted with pecorino cheese, was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever tasted! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=rim0X5ASqEnkKycpVFFLyQ#rim0X5ASqEnkKycpVFFLyQ  Exquisite in its presentation, temperature wasn't too hot, buttery, and yes, rich, but not too much so that I couldn't finish it.  In fact, I exercised restraint, only so that I could also enjoy the chocolate and vanilla gelati and apricot sorbetto for dessert (choice of three scoops). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=ndq8cYqhNck6u0vPP3I10Q#ndq8cYqhNck6u0vPP3I10Q  My fave was the apricot-- tasted so fresh and crisp; AMAZING apricot flavor!  The gelati felt too heavy in comparison, and quite frankly, a tad boring.  My three scoops of dessert at my next visit to Sassi will definitely be all sorbetti!  These are what my friends ordered: Sicilian Eggplant Cakes- currants, pine nuts, tomato sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=aGQ1AwONWhUfk_jYf2EMPA#aGQ1AwONWhUfk_jYf2EMPA  Wood grilled gamberoni- shrimp, cannellini bean, salsa verde http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=677LodS4kNmQGhKKzfS6zQ#677LodS4kNmQGhKKzfS6zQ  Cannoli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=M-JKlnyXUcE07PUbMw3BNg#M-JKlnyXUcE07PUbMw3BNg Farro salad- goat cheese, mint, red onion, cucumber, pistachio, and red wine vinaigrette http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=5SnOMLIBQhSq1oWkAKxZVQ#5SnOMLIBQhSq1oWkAKxZVQ  (Tried this, in spite of pistachio allergy and liked it a lot!  Would've had more, but I spotted cukes in there, too.) Beef short rib- red wine-braised, porcini, citrus herb gremolata http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=4R8m8Iti3apMfmDsG73Icg#4R8m8Iti3apMfmDsG73Icg  Semifreddo, with fresh berries and balsamic vinegar http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=fI2Sl74-spyxAnG27V2Wnw#fI2Sl74-spyxAnG27V2Wnw  (Tried the semifreddo only and found it creamy, yet muted in flavor.  The chill factor was also not very pronounced.  I really preferred my dessert!)  If you decide to go, you MUST get the Wood grilled octopus!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=xbSzBL18HlU4r6nwDrKx4Q#xbSzBL18HlU4r6nwDrKx4Q  It's the best octopus preparation I've ever experienced!  I'll be back!

Changing Hands is my favorite bookstore in the valley!  (Haven't tried Bookman's or Bookstar, yet.)  It is truly such a treat to stop by here everytime.  I really must visit often.  I love the occasional book readings/signings held here.  My first-ever was Gilbert's _Eat Pray Love_.  How fun!!  Another nice event was the complimentary viewing of "An Inconvenient Truth."  I'd wanted to see that movie for many months, and it was nice to finally view it here and then have a Q&A session afterwards.    I enjoy the clusters of privacy and gift-sections to be found throughout the store.  Having Wildflower Bread Co. next door is quite convenient, although I always seemed to have just dined whenever I visit CHB... I'll have to make it a point to eat at Wildflower before shopping for books on my next visit!

08/30/12  Was here for Stephen Chbosky's Q&A and book-signing event for _the perks of being a wallflower_.  I've only been to three book-signing events, and the two most-fun ones were held here!  My first ever was Elizabeth Gilbert's _Eat Pray Love_ event, which was VERY engaging and entertaining, so I had a feeling that Chbosky's event would be just as pleasing.    The space was packed with an eclectic mix of teenagers, young adults, and professor-types.  I suspect a large percentage of the audience were writers themselves, individuals who aspire to become writers, or are curious to learn more about the creative processes of writing, acting, and directing.  The author was funny, very approachable, empowering and confident,  and yet very humble.  The long excerpt he read was from an audience member's well-used book with a jacket that did not resemble any of the two current ones (a lemon-yellow one and a movie cover).  After the reading, Chbosky opened the floor to questions, each of which he answered in depth and with a lot of humor!  At one point, a young mother had to rock and coo her baby to stop fussing, but the author immediately put her at ease with an "oh no, don't worry..." and that he had a three-week old daughter at home and so knew what the mother was going through, so "just let the baby cry and do her thing."  I thought it fantastic how he encouraged aspiring writers to not listen to those who limited their creative processes, but to find their own ways, their own voices with which to express their thoughts.  Questions were asked on what inspired him to write certain poems in the book (the protagonist Charlie writes poems and diary entries that address the audience members as if they were reading the entries themselves, as opposed to being narrated to), how it was to direct certain scenes, and what it was like to work with the cast, which included Emma Watson (Hermione in the Harry Potter movies), Logan Lerman (D'Artagnan in 2011's The Three Musketeers), and Ezra Miller (Kevin in We Need to Talk About Kevin).  He even had a lovely mention regarding actor Paul Rudd's participation in the movie... I am looking forward to seeing the film, which is coming out next month!  :)  I was first attracted to this book, which I've yet to read, when I caught the movie's trailer a few weeks ago and was frozen in my tracks upon hearing the honest, eye-opening quote, one of the author's favorite lines he's written to date:  "We accept the love we think we deserve."    I cannot wait to delve into the book to find other gems.  I already know I'll find the movie lovely.  I thank Changing Hands for hosting yet another terrific book event- I had a wonderful time!

Spotted a cool-sounding event regarding Amy Stewart's newest book, The Drunken Botanist, a couple of weeks ago via an email blast and decided to check it out after my massage and dinner in Tempe.  It wasn't a ticketed event, which meant a purchase was not required to attend, which was something new, as all of the events I've attended at CH required a reservation.  Another cool twist to this event was that Pimm's (vodka, ginger beer, lime) cocktails were going to be served (one per person limit), as per the author's recipe, which is included in the book.  I WASN'T impressed with the free beverage (too sweet), and there's a number of factors that could explain why it wasn't good, besides subjectivity, but the author was HIGHLY-ENTERTAINING in her responses to the few pre-selected topics prompted by the moderator, and then answered a few more when said moderator "opened the floor" to audience questions.  So entertaining was the author, and so enamored am I of Changing Hands and the fun events I've had the opportunity to experience here, that I bought a few books, both to support CH and its ability to organize fun events, such as this, and to have the author autograph them with the names I gave her a list of, so that I may gift these books to a few loved ones whom I KNOW will appreciate!  The hardcover book is gorgeous, and I'm happy to own a copy of it myself.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/changing-hands-bookstore-tempe-2?select=r61c1k4z8nqYhJopOUX-NA#r61c1k4z8nqYhJopOUX-NA  Afterwards, I perused the Health and Beauty shelves for natural and organic soaps and body lotions and found a couple of Pre de Provence soaps ($7 each; French quadruple-milled), three Wild Women Soaps (individually wrapped, $5 each; based in Mesa, AZ-- SUPPORT LOCAL!), and The Naked Bee Pomegranate** & Honey hand & body lotion (70% Certified Organic; FREE of parabens, propylene glycol, gluten, drying alcohol, dyes/pigments, mineral oil, EDTA, and phthalate-based fragrances, AND not tested on animals!).  I was able to redeem a free-to-use loyalty card (a punch for every $10 spent, $100 total nets you a $10 discount on future purchase!), so not only did I leave with a few great-smelling natural soaps and lotions, but I also saved money while feeling good about supporting local Changing Hands and Mesa's Wild Women Soaps.  :)  I LOVE Changing Hands!  **If you're like me, who grew up in Asia a few decades ago and had the opportunity to experience scented Sanrio stationery, you perhaps loved this singular scent that may have ruined all other stationery for you, no matter how much more elegant they looked and felt, simply because they just weren't delicately-scented as those Japanese stationery of our childhood.  I never knew what this gorgeous scent was made from until a few years ago (five, maybe 10, or slightly more?), when products featuring pom started popping up Stateside.  The Naked Bee product I found here at CH bathes me in that lovely scent that reminds me of many happy memories of childhood friendships, of holidays with family, of writing, and of dreaming.  And all for just $11 and tax... what a fantastic find!

Attended Sue Hitzmann's talk on her new book (released in January?) The MELT Method at Changing Hands tonight.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/changing-hands-bookstore-tempe-2?select=-je8qF4FSr5IJy0_O3bF5g#-je8qF4FSr5IJy0_O3bF5g  When I found out about the event a couple of weeks ago, I did a search on her name and book title and came across a YouTube vid.  After viewing it, I promptly searched her book on Amazon and bought it and made a note of the event in my calendar.  Tonight's event was exhilarating!  I kept wishing certain members of my family were also present, because I know they would appreciate the info Sue was telling us.  Most of us in the audience were able to do a handful of exercises and were able to get positive feedback just from following her simple instructions in just a matter of minutes.  I'm hoping to be able to attend a class she's holding tomorrow at Scottsdale Airpark at 1 pm.  The class fee is $25, but Sue promised that those who attend will receive a MELT bag of treatment balls to accompany the methods outlined in her book, a few of which she will personally teach us tomorrow.  If you'd like to get more info about Hitzmann, her book, and the MELT classes here in the valley, visit meltmethod.com.  Check out the video that made me want to check out the event! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1Fu-m-MxKE

Walked here after having dinner at Liberty Market, since I couldn't have any of the desserts offered there.  After the friendly and very helpful female host helped to phone the pastry chef to address my food allergies, I placed my order of a slice of "Dangerous Dilemma" and a chocolate-covered walnut strudel and was seated at a two-top next to a window with a view of a parking lot.  I decided to while away the wait on the dessert by looking at the baubles on display by the entrance.  A few moments later, the host notified me that the strudel had cornstarch, so it's a no-no for me, and that  I would not be able to dine inside since I should not have been seated with an "outside drink."  "Would this be a problem?," she asked. I said no, paid for my to-go dessert, and settled on a bench outside the cafe.  While the two forkfuls that I tried of the multi-layered dense cake (cookie crumb bottom layer, dark chocolate fudge cake, white chocolate mousse, another layer of dark chocolate fudge cake, and then topped with raspberry coulis) were delicious, I inadvertently became the meal of ghost mosquitoes (so I had to pack up and leave, yet again).  All because I had a lidded to-go cup of Liberty Market drip house coffee with me. The $6.54 (tax included) cake slice was tasty (although almost a bit too sweet), and I can't fault someone for following house rules, but I wished my drink could've been overlooked.  (There were only two occupied tables out of 12 to 15 tables.) Heck, I could've ordered a glass of wine, or another cup of coffee, with my dessert had I not been turned away...

Was on a break at work at 3pm two days ago considering Wildfish for happy hour, so I called first to see if I could speak w/ a kitchen manager or chef re food allergies and soon was speaking to sous chef Matt.  Since I've had happy hour (1/2 off select apps) there before- I've not had the pleasure of having dinner, yet- I already knew I loved the All Lump Crabcake (reg. $14.95) and the Crispy Cashew Calamari ($12.95?).  Knowing that many Asian recipes use * I asked Matt if the calamari salad contained any (I recalled that the salad had * as a garnish) - the answer was yes.  That left me w/ the crabcake.  Did Wildfish use ** in preparation?  No on the *, but yes on the * (the remoulade that came w/ the crabcake also contained *), but if I were to call in the morning and let them know I was going to have dinner there, he'd be able to make a batch of *-free crabcake and remoulade.  I lamented that I was actually going to head over there at 4p, but... Immediately, Matt said he'd have a special batch ready for me, no problem (!!).  I also spotted Maine lobster bisque on the online menu and had asked Matt if roux or * was used as a thickener (if *, then I couldn't have it), but, like most quality restaurants, Wildfish uses only roux.  Upon hearing this tidbit, I was excited and looking forward to having a bowl of bisque, the crabcake app, and a glass of cabernet!  As soon as I walked into the restaurant, I was warmly accosted by the host, who informed me that I could sit anywhere I wanted.  I asked her if I could speak with Matt and was told he'd be informed I was there.  While I waited, I perused through the menu and found that BV Signet chardonnay, merlot, and cab sauvignon were the select wines selling for $5 a glass during happy hour, so I chose the cab.  I also ordered a bowl of the lobster bisque.  A few minutes passed by, my delicious cab arrived (I love the wine glasses there!), and soon I was speaking to Matt in person, who must have spent at least 20 minutes w/ me (in addition to the time he spent on the phone w/ me earlier) throughout my time there looking over the menu and seeing which items I could try and which were off-limits.  It's so refreshing to know that there are restaurants who have staff who are willing to take the time to listen to their customers and be willing to tweak their recipes so that people w/ food issues may still enjoy many menu options.  I was happy to learn that afternoon, that most, if not all, the seafood dishes could be adjusted, either by leaving off one or more ingredients, or by substituting a different sauce (which many restaurants are unwilling to do, it seems- something to do w/ quality control) or vegetable side.  The topic of desserts came up soon enough, so for those with corn allergies, you'll be happy to know that the Cinnamon-raisin bread pudding and Hot chocolate Godiva cake, as well as the Hot apple & cinnamon cobbler (minus the ice cream- it contains corn syrup) and Creme brulee (minus the cookies- they contain baking powder, but don't worry, he'll substitute fresh berries, instead!) are SAFE TO ENJOY.  I of course adored the special crabcake Matt prepared for me- I confess I was so smitten by it, that I had TWO crabcake dishes (Matt was gracious enough to whip up another batch for me!) along w/ the table bread and butter.  I must mention that as I was sipping a few tablespoonsfuls of the bisque, Matt stopped by to let me know that it contained a couple of ingredients I mentioned needing to avoid, so he promptly took the soup out of my sight.  No worries, though, as this left me more room for that second crabcake!  (Sadly, I did exhibit allergy symptoms all day Wednesday...)  (Hope you enjoy the photos.  Love that ice mountain adorned with shellfish!  FYI, fresh-shucked oysters are 50c during happy hour!!)

10/01  Had dinner with a group of yelp friends.  Thanks to Jim W. for organizing yet another fun event!  The weather was perfect and made for a relaxing dinner out in the patio.    For dinner, I ordered the Krakauer Wurst, a spicy beef and pork sausage with a crispy sausage casing ("spicy" and "crispy" were the keywords in my choosing this dish!) platter, which included German fried potatoes, sauerkraut, and a bowl of chicken and cabbage soup ($9.95).  I would order this dish again!  Loved the spiciness and textures of the sausage (would I be able to enjoy trying out the other non-spicy dishes if I decide not to order the Krakauer on my next visit??), and the fried potatoes were very good- of course, I only ate the crispiest of the bunch.  I've been avoiding cabbage for many months now, but after sampling a taste of it tonight, I had to have more :)  I didn't taste the soup- that came home with me for my roomie to enjoy- but a few others received it with their meals, and the aroma was intoxicating!  BTW, I was also handed some horseradish on the side as part of the platter, but the sausage was spicy enough that I didn't need it.  For dessert, I ordered a slice of the German chocolate cake ($6.95?)- four layers of cake iced with homemade whip cream, cherry jam with cherries, and almond slivers coating one side.  A dollop of fresh whip cream placed beside it just added a little more sweetness to this lovely meal's end.  I would also order this confection again =)  I almost forgot!  Haus Murphy was gracious enough to offer two complimentary pretzels for the table.  While I had only a couple of small twists, I really enjoyed them!  I will surely order this on my next visit!

Visted twice in the past few weeks.  First visit was for happy hour, and I tried three items at $5 each: the house margarita, the churrasco (steak skewers) cooked medium-rare, and a Tex-Mex take on eggrolls.  LOVED the margarita... one of the best I've ever had!  Really liked the eggrolls (pork, carrots, black beans).  Can't say the same for the skewers, though, as they weren't cooked enough- chewy texture and still pretty bloody, actually.  Yes, I ordered them cooked medium-rare, but I've ordered steak burgers at the same temperature before at a few other places and all came out very edible.  These weren't.  If I were to order them again, and I probably won't, I'd go for medium to medium-well.   On the second visit, I had their cheeseburger, cooked medium-rare, with smoked gouda (wow!), sweet potato fries as the accompanying side, and (subbed) chipotle mayo.  I found the buns used very, very tasty- loved the grilled texture.  Last, but certainly not least, the sweet potato fries were superb!  These were light, non-greasy, no cinnamon-sugar coating, and easy on the salt.  I loved it both ways- at times plain, and other times dipped in the chipotle mayo.  Should I ever have a craving for SPF, I'm heading to Cafe Carumba!   Very friendly service and clean women's restroom.  I'll definitely be back!

Four stars for service rendered by Marketplace employee Rene, who helped answer questions regarding my food issues (allergies) and info regarding breakfast/brunch, lunch, and dinner options/times, and also provided gelato samples, including his favorite, Guiness gelato!  Mmm... guiness gelato...  If you haven't already done so, do try the German chocolate cake, peanut butter cup, and, of course, the Guiness gelato flavors.  All gelatos are made in-house w/ all-natural ingredients, I'm told.  (I really need to double-check w/ the one who prepares them.)  3 scoops offer the best value ($4.50).  I also bought oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip  cookies ($1.50 each) from the bakery.  I'd skip on the oatmeal cookie as it didn't really taste like oatmeal at all, although the raisins were large and lent so much creamy sweetness to the cookie!  It did contain *, w/c I've an allergy to, so that may have turned me off of the cookie fast!    (1/22/09 update: I was so lethargic at work yesterday, and was literally tripping over my feet walking w/ people asking me if I'm alright all day, and I didn't know why.  I finally figured out why- it was my body's reaction to the * I'd consumed from the cookie!!  Geez!  Sometimes I really, really, really hate having these food allergies!)  OK, back to the review...  The chocolate chip, however, was delightful!  Different kinds of chocolate chips in this one, and I loved both the gooey and crunchy textures this cookie provided. I got all excited when I read "cookie sandwich ($3)," on the menu, as I thought it meant an ice cream cookie sandwich, in w/c case the Guiness would've been perfect nestled in between two oatmeal cookies.  That is, before I found out that I didn't really care for the cookie, in w/c case, chocolate chip would be the best option, BUT "cookie sandwich" really denotes peanut butter slapped in between two cookies, and the marketplace was out of peanut butter at 4p, so no cookie sandwich for me.  No worries, since what I really wanted a gelato sandwich!  Ooh, boy, I was really jonesing for a Pot Belly ice cream sandwich then!!  I'll definitely be back very soon to try other menu selections.  Patio dining sounds wonderful (I'm told there are couches out there!), but dining outside isn't really all that appealing to me since I do not enjoy breathing in tobacco smoke, and after seeing how dusty and insect-crusted the patio tables were on the marketplace side, I'd definitely be averse to the idea.

UPDATE 1/21/09  Took Mom here for dinner after work tonight.  We requested indoor dining, but was fortunate enough to be seated at a four-top next to the patio, therefore benefitting from the wide-open spaces of both indoor and patio.  My Mom, who is fickle and hard-to-impress, clearly loved the ambience.  Her contentment alone made the trip for me!!  We ordered the calamari and the pesto flatbread for dinner.  I inquired if bread was served, to which the server nodded yes.  I excused myself to the restroom to wash hands, and on my way there spotted some foccacia on a cutting board and saw a server dole out a beautiful-looking pesto onto a dish.  I mentioned this to Mom, and we soon were able to  see this upclose.  We loved the combination!!  Feast your eyes on this lovely verdant, and very fresh pesto sauce!!  I've been so forgetful lately when it comes to food photos, and I've yet to remember to take a few while I'm dining out w/ Mom.  It's a shame, though, since the calamari, w/ zucchini and a lemon-garlic aioli sauce, and the pesto flatbread (basil pesto, roasted garlic and tomatoes, parmesan cheese) were gorgeous!!  Again, it brought such joy to see my Mom enjoying herself.  I knew I found another great place to take her when she mentioned how great the flatbread was a few minutes after we'd arrived home!!  Thank you, Olive & Ivy!  Will definitely bring out-of-town relatives here to dine underneath the stars should they ever come for a visit!  Mom sampled the German chocolate cake and Guiness gelatos, but neither impressed her.  I say it's bec. she was so contented w/ dinner... We'll be back very soon!    BTW, Mom almost swayed me from taking her here (taking her somewhere new is almost always a crapshoot, w/ most attempts a "seven out!") when she brought up Nello's, but I told her we'd try somewhere new and go to Nello's next time.  I can't stress it enough how this place had made such an impression on her!!

It was a beautiful morning, slightly chilly still, but it was sunny and I had a sweater on, so I elected to dine in the patio.  I'd already perused through the menu online, and when I saw that the menu had not changed, I knew I'd have the Power Ranches organic beef burger ($14), cooked to medium (was told it would still be pink), with Bravo white cheddar, subbged with plain aioli, Nueske bacon, house made pickles on the side, with house made potato chips with blue cheese fondue.  I decided against having a glass of wine and ordered filtered iced water, instead.  Other reviewers weren't kidding- this is slow food, so be prepared to wait!  If I had company, I'd definitely order an appetizer to help stave off hunger pangs- the artisanal cheese (choice of three) with fruits and nuts sounds delicious!  Will have to try this during snacktime (from 2p to 5p), where apps are slightly discounted ($2 off?).  Entree arrived-  what a beauty! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LMdUoR00jPxQDWLYRq93FA?select=Y_QK_tR_PdaoNoXdHXyR4g#Y_QK_tR_PdaoNoXdHXyR4g  I immediately had to try a chip!  I did notice that the burger was was not cooked to medium- definitely not slightly reddish, not even slightly pink.  Nevertheless, it was juicy and tender, and just pure delight!  Loved the rustic bread used; the Nueske bacon (thick-cut, and such a treat...  I want to buy some to use at home- does anyone know where I may procure some?  Whole Foods?); and the farm greens and shaved red onion, as well.    Was able to check out the interior on my way to the restroom to wash hands before dining and after... Oh, so charming!  What a great place to dine at while on a retreat here.  Hope to visit again very soon!

01/19/11  Didn't realize it's been a couple of years since my last visit to Vincitorio's until I decided to have dinner here this afternoon.  Arrived around 530p, and there were maybe one or two tables occupied.  I was seated at the first two-top near the front door, which put me right next to a young woman, and her acoustic guitar, who was to provide the live entertainment that would eventually start at 6p.  Her original work was pretty good, and she took special requests, as well.  (She later told me that she was going to be playing there again the next week.  I hope she's a recurring performer there, bec. I wouldn't mind hearing her voice and her guitar-playing again!)  Tonight's dinner composed of great complimentary buttered garlic bread, a glass of Alois Lageder Riff pinot grigio 2008, and Roasted butternut squash ravioli, which came w/ choice of soup or salad (I chose the latter, w/ blue cheese crumbles and a side of house-made blue cheese dressing).  The salad was very fresh and crisp, and I loved it w/ just the blue cheese crumbles- no need for the dressing!  I enjoyed the bread and salad too much, I think-- I ate almost the whole salad and had to order a second batch of garlic bread!  The roasted butternut squash is one of eight handmade pasta entrees on their dinner menu and comes w/ an addicting four-cheese cream sauce composed of parmigiano, fontina, pecorino, and gorgonzola, which are among my top favorite cheeses!  Now, I will admit that this dish did not make a great visual first impression w/ me (check out the photos), but I knew better than to judge a book by its cover. Yes, it didn't look as appetizing as it could have, but I assure you, the aroma that emanated from this dish was intoxicating, and the butternut squash inside the oh-so-tender ravioli was cooked to perfection!  Its roasted sweetness and the lovely four-cheese cream sauce made a matchless pair!  It was difficult to curb my desire to eat all four pieces...  Mmm... I was in heaven!    As dinner rolled on, the restaurant started to get quite packed w/ what seemed to be regulars, and it's very easy to see why-- I hadn't finished w/ my meal yet, and I was already looking forward to returning the next week!  (Alas, I am forever in search for other great venues to try, so I postponed my next trip back- Valentine's Day, as it turned out!)  Thank you, Vincitorio's, for a fantastic evening!

3/16/16  Decided to have dinner here with Mom since we were in the area.  Ginger, the wife of Mario (the chef and owner of Vincitorios), and a host greeted us at the host's stand.  Mom didn't want to eat outside, so we asked to be seated indoors.  The only available table, as all the others were reserved (due to a 6 pm live show), was a four-top round table at the corner next to the restrooms.  Aside from having to smell the room spray emanating from the restrooms every time someone entered or exited, the corner table would've been a nice area, as it was surrounded by walls decorated to look like windows with lace curtains.  I wished we'd left and chosen another restaurant, but we stayed.   Our server, Crystal, came and asked if we wanted something to drink besides water.  We settled with water, but I said I might order a glass of wine depending on what I choose to have for dinner.  We finally got around to ordering (Mom wanted the Seafood Fradiavolo, and I was torn between the Stuffed pork chop and the Cannelloni.  She said the pork chop was good, so I chose that, and she asked me again if I wanted to order some wine.  Still looking, I said.  I also asked if we could have some bread.  Soon after she left, I decided I'd just skip wine and have dessert, so when she returned with the bread and our salads, I told her I'd skip the wine and opt for dessert, instead, so I asked her if I may look over the dessert menu.  So far, she's all smiles, and everything is good.  We're done with our salads, and Crystal takes our plates away, and soon after, our food arrives, and she returns shortly and asks if everything is OK.  I asked if the homemade tiramisu contained powdered sugar in the filling.  She said she'd find out.  Before she left, though, we did complain that Mom's Fradiavolo looked very soupy.  Mom wasn't happy.  Crystal said that's how it's supposed to look, so Mom asked if she could have extra marinara to add to the dish and perhaps that will thicken it up.  Crystal obliged, and I requested for more garlic bread.  I wasn't happy with my stuffed pork chop's béchamel sauce, either, but I didn't complain.  I opted to be positive about the tasty gnocchi.  That is, the ones that weren't doused with the awful béchamel sauce and that actually had some browned butter and sage flavor on them.  I contented myself with more garlic bread, and the thought of having tiramisu.  I hoped Crystal would come back soon to tell me if the tiramisu was good to go (not containing powdered sugar), but she didn't.  Neither did the extra garlic bread.    After awhile, I saw Crystal checking on two tables next to us, but she quickly left.  A young man started attending to us, so I figured she'd passed us off to someone else.  Mom wasn't happy about this, and neither was I.  She didn't think Crystal had other tables, but I said that I saw her attending to two others.  Mom used to wait tables decades ago, and her coworkers would say "What do you do?," "What do you say?," and "I don't see you talking much, yet you get large tips- how?"  Mom knew to bring items to her customers before they would ask for them, and she didn't get too chummy, or hover around and be intrusive.  It's why she's hard to impress when dining out, and why she thinks I overtip all the time.  But back to tonight's meal.  Since Crystal never came back with the extra bread, and Mom and I were both done with our meal (we didn't eat much), I'd asked the young man to find out if the tiramisu contained powdered sugar in the filling, and he said he'd ask.  While he was gone, Crystal came back and she asked if we wanted our food to be boxed.  We said yes, but not to include the soupy broth of the Fradiavolo, and I only wanted the meat and the pasta, no béchamel sauce.  She leaves.  Soon after, the young man comes back to tell me that the tiramisu isn't made with powdered sugar, so I ordered it, and as he leaves, Crystal arrives with the boxes, and she must've heard me order the dessert.  She said, no, the tiramisu's filling contained powdered sugar, so I can't have it.  I asked "But he just found out for me that it didn't."  "Oh, he must've misunderstood."  I took it as she didn't want us to occupy her table any longer by having dessert.    Mom was upset that I tipped 15%.  I tip at least 20-25%, but I tip even more for friendly and helpful service that is absent of condescension.  For years I'd spoken highly of Vincitorio's to Mom, and I was excited to take her tonight.  I lamented that we had arrived too early (4:45p) and miss out on hearing a cool vocalist at 6, and Mom seemed interested when I mentioned that the singer arrived and was prepping her stage, which was hidden from our table.  I'd hoped we'd get to return to enjoy the show, but Mom doesn't want to go back, and I most likely won't return.

7/31  Late lunch was a Quiche Lorraine, which came with a side salad.  Looked absolutely delicious, but did not provide the mouth-feel I craved.  I was still reeling from the blissful onion tarte I had at Coup des Tartes and was hoping to reclaim that gastronomical "hit" with the cake-y quiche (it was a bit dry).  Greens were also a tad under-dressed.      I wouldn't order the quiche again, but I will go back and try other items.  In the meantime, I'll just admire the photos I took at Essence...

03/06/10  I rarely find myself in this part of Phoenix, so when I knew I was going to be in the area, I had two places in mind for a late lunch.  I was hoping to dine at Bobby Q, but I found the prices a bit too steep to dine alone, so I headed here.  Found the menu uninteresting that day, perhaps bec. I was looking forward to good bbq fare, but I finally settled on the basics- hummus and falafel.  For those who care, the falafel were fried in soybean oil.  (Most places I've inquired at use corn, and sometimes peanut, oil.)  The platter looked very appetizing, but don't be fooled!  The hummus was very bland, and the falafel pieces weren't that great, either.  I had to ask for lemon to get some flavor out of the falafel, and the hummus' saving grace was that it lent the falafel some lubrication.  The pita bread was probably the best thing out of the whole meal, and that's not saying much.  Afterwards, I checked out the bakery next door for some expensive baklava.  I chose three varieties, and I found them all too heavy on soggy phyllo and lacking in honey.    $13 for terrible baklava and $7 (or more) on less than mediocre hummus and falafel made for such a disappointing adventure that day.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Not even to anyone that didn't like me.  (But then again, I'd never do that, anyway.)

I couldn't wait for this Filipino national chain to open up back in 2007.  I was there on opening week, at three-month mark, and then another three months later.  All visits were met with horrible service and mediocre food, most of which tasted canned.  If you feel like you must visit and eat here, then try the lechon.  It's the dish the chain is famous for back home.  It's the one item offered I cannot complain about.  Customer service is horrible; you may start with one server and end up with another.  You'll be lucky if either knows what the dishes they're serving are (none I stopped to ask could visually identify what the food they were bringing to the table were called), much less what ingredients they're comprised of, and these are servers that have been there for months (maybe even a few years, since I haven't been in for a very long time).  The first week was understandable, but the same lousy service extended to you after three months?  After six months??    On my last visit, I specifically stated I was in the mood for fresh seafood and asked the server, who was the brother-in-law of the manager, for some suggestions.  Upon hearing that I liked mussels, he suggested I try the mussel dish.  When I complained of the taste of the dish, the manager disclosed to me that the mussels were from a can.  What the !@#?  He then tried to appease me by saying that dessert would be on the house.    I was kept waiting for another 15 minutes or so while they tracked down my server, since he apparently left the property.  Knowing what I know now, I could wager a bet on where he went, but then I would be disclosing where I work, and I'd rather not.  He was finally called back in, and I tried the ube halaya dessert, which I now wished I did not waste 30 minutes of my life waiting for.  To top it off, the bill arrived with the charges including the disgraceful entree AND dessert.  Tsk, tsk.  The shame was all on me for coming back the third time...  Do yourselves a huge favor and do not eat here.  These proprietors used to do business in California.  Do some legwork and see why they left that state and set up shop here.  What a disgrace to the Barrio Fiesta reputation built back home.   (Actually, Barrio Fiesta has franchised so widely in the Philippines that it no longer has the great reputation it once did 20 or so years ago.  I think that Kamayan is a more-honored chain; I had the opportunity to dine at a Makati location in '99 and the food was FANTASTIC!)

I've recently started visiting Lush again over the past two, three weeks once-a-week to see what new bath bomb I can try after my weekly deep-tissue massages.  The first bath bomb I tried was called Geo Phyzz (Hawaiian seasalt, sandalwood, cypress, and pine), but I wasn't too impressed with the small bath globe.  My apartment's bathroom features a Roman tub, which allows for a deeper bath, but I rarely fill it past the tops of my quads.  (TMI?  Sorry!)  Anyhoo, the Geo Phyzz didn't alter the bathwater much, as far as I could tell.  Not much scent, color, or even fizzing!  My muscles didn't feel refreshed immediately-after, nor the next day.  Perhaps due to its smaller size, I need to use two bath bombs, but Lush's bath bombs aren't inexpensive.  Heck!  Nothing at Lush runs cheap!  Just as the store's name implies, Lush is all about pure bath and beauty indulgence!  I think the Geo Phyzz cost just under $5, which I thought was a complete waste of money and not worth a second chance.  (Not from me, anyway.)  The second time I went, I chose the Big Blue, which was considerably bigger than the Geo Phyzz and consisted of sodium bicarbonate, two varieties of seaweed, including Arame, both fine and course sea salts, lemon, and lavender oils, and other ingredients** (cleansing and coloring components).  It cost just under $7 and was definitely a winner!  Loved the tropical fragrances that scented the bathwater, my skin, AND the bathroom!  My muscles thanked me for the indulgence, and I believe I even slept in a little longer, too!  :)    Have yet to try the Twilight Ballistic ($6.25; lavender, tonka absolute, ylang-ylang), which I purchased the same day as the Geo Phyzz.  It smells HEAVENLY and, for me, a touch of sweetness.  Mmm... I can't wait!  ;)  **Very much appreciate how the products come with ingredients' lists on their shelves.  My allergies don't just affect my eating patterns, but also dictate what products I apply on my skin, scalp, and clothing.  Once in awhile, I'll find a product that is missing the ingredient info, so I just skip over to the next product that catches my eye, or, perhaps more appropriately, my olfactory nerves!  If you do wish to find out more info, the super-bubbly (no pun intended!) associates here are always willing to help!

Just say no to Walmart!!  (Walmart is a big supporter of Devil Monsanto!)  I've stopped shopping at the Walmart by my apartment and now get all the stuff I normally buy there at this location- L'Oreal Sulfates-free line of shampoos and conditioners and other staples.  Tonight, I needed to get Mom a jar of Laura Scudder peanut butter, her favorite brand.  It costs a little over a dollar more per jar here ($3.29, instead of $2.24 at Walmart), BUT I also spotted jars of Laura Scudder ORGANIC peanut butter selling at $4.19, which Walmart DOESN'T even carry.  (And even if it did, it doesn't matter anymore, since I won't ever go back!)

Cashier Sheri/Sherry was very rude tonight- first time I encountered a rude rep here.  I placed two towels on the tread and told her I weren't going to purchase them, and then quickly placed a third item on top- a long robe, which I also did not want to buy.  She rang the robe up, so I had to tell her sorry, but that I didn't want it.  I then placed three towels and two thermal shirts to purchase.  I stopped to search for the mobile promo code that I had found earlier, but saw that they were online only codes.  I said I was just going to buy them without, and then I asked if she knew about any promo codes I could use, to which she replied that there were only online codes, not in-store.  I thanked her, to which she said nothing, and she also did not say thank you and goodbye, which I thought was rude.  I visited TJ Maxx after and found three towels I liked (and where I was thanked for coming in, I might add), so I went back to Target and returned the towels I'd bought.  I found it ironic that the employee that left a bad taste in my mouth earlier was manning the returns counter, so it was she that credited back the money I spent on the towels that would forever remind me of her had I kept them.  Again, no greetings of goodbye, or thank you,  So rude!

Ate here a few times since 2004.  Haven't been in many, many months.  Love all but one of the pasties I've tried, thus far.  Great to know that you can call ahead to custom-order!  Also, you may call ahead and have your order started so that it's ready by the time you arrive!  (It took one of my pasties 50 minutes' preparation and cook time from phone call to my table!)  Best to order a few and share!  Keep in mind, one of these pasties could contain up to 1200 calories or more!  One word: BUTTER.    Vegan pasties are also available, but you must call ahead to have them made.

4/7/10 Have I mentioned how I love the cranberry scones at Wildflower Bread Co.??  They're very moist and studded with gorgeous dried cranberries... My favorite part to eat, being a crunchy food-lover, is the super-flaky, caramelized crust!    The only reason I don't rate w/ 5 stars is because the last time I bought a few from this location, the crust flavor tasted "off," as if another lipid was used to cook them with, or that the butter used was slightly rancid.  They definitely did not taste as fresh as the others I've purchased here before.

Had a group of eleven people dining at Yupha's tonight.  My group of three shared the soft-shelled crabs with veggies and garlic sauce and honey roasted duck with steamed veggies (delish, but half of the plate was duck skin and fat, which doesn't translate to good value for the money).  We still enjoyed dinner, however.  We also ordered the excellent homemade coconut ice cream, which upgrades this review from a three- to a four-star!  My other companions enjoyed apps of chicken satay w/ peanut sauce, and fried and steamed dumplings.  I heard the pad thai was very satisfying.    After conferring with my cousin, who agreed with me that the crabs, while good, weren't as tasty as before, we've decided we'll just stop by when we have a craving for coco ice cream.  Hmm... having ice cream while chatting over a viewing at the discount cinema next door sounds like a great outing to me!

7/27/11  3.5 stars.  Took Mom here for her first visit and tried a couple of gelato dishes**.  The first was a "sundae" that consisted of two mini-scoops of roche and mango, with a chocolate crackle topping and some crushed almonds. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-gelato-spot-scottsdale-4?select=uFQNSuTdlIVr0JknTh8YZQ#uFQNSuTdlIVr0JknTh8YZQ  D'lish!  The second dish was a warmed brownie sundae, with a scoop of bacio gelato (chocolate-hazelnut gelato with chunks of dark chocolate).  Also quite good, but was made too rich with the addition of the chocolate syrup.  (I prefer rich and ever-so-slightly bitter ganache, or hot fudge as a topping, rather than sickeningly sweet and runny chocolate syrup.)    **I stopped going to Gelato Spot when I noticed I was getting allergy symptoms afterwards (rashes, stomach aches, and worse symptoms, of which I will spare you the details- you're welcome).

1/30/10 Like previous visitors, I've lived near the area for a few years, but today was my first visit (of course, it was the first time I took a Saturday off from work specifically to see what the hype was all about).  Arrived at the end of outdoor farmers' market hours, but managed to have a look at some unique or hard-to-find goods (specialty jams, nuts, pasta, Crave ice cream!, as well as jewelry, clothing, and home goods, etc.), besides farm-fresh veggies on sale.  I was very hungry (having only woken up a few hours before to exercise, shower, and dash to the outdoor market before they closed down for the weekend), so I rushed looking over the goods, found there wasn't any fresh, hot breakfast to be had, and thus entered the PDM itself.  What a quaint, little shop!  It reminded me of a clean Sprout's or Sunflower Market, w/ refrigerated sections full of organic and/or locally-produced meats, Shamrock and Horizon organic milk, and cheese.  The grocery shelves held the usual  items you'd find at said markets above, but there were a few unique brands I've never seen before (soaps, to be more specific).  Prices were a bit higher than in said markets.  What I really liked here was the counter where you ordered fresh, hot food to eat in, or take out.  Loved that the breads featured were from a couple of local shops (spec. Simply Bread).  The pastry case tempted me so!  Breakfast had just ended, so it took awhile for me to peruse through their lunch menu.  I decided to try the Sweet Italian sandwich w/ a choice of side (salad or chips- I chose the salad).  The sandwich was so tasty!  A must-try, if you like sausage and peppers.  (I enjoyed it so much, I almost walked out w/ a package of sausage from the refrigerated section, but I had somewhere else to go to afterwards and had not packed my cooler w/ ice to do proper food shopping.  I just figured it gave me a great reason to visit again soon!)  I also popped into the coffee bar next door... what a cute place!

Came here once in 2004.  I'd give it 5 stars based on the calzone alone!  It was my first time trying one of these, and Nicantoni's spinach calzone is still the best I've had (and I've tried quite a few.  If "calzone" is on a venue's menu, I usually order it just so that I can compare it to Nic's).    The calzone measured roughly 8"x5"x5."  Yep, that's 5 inches flush on the table below your nose!  This baby was HUGE!  I like my calzones super-crusty on the outside and not too doughy on the inside.  Nope, it wasn't doughy at all.  For reference, Chandler's NYPD's calzone is my second favorite, but it doesn't even come close to the greatness of NIcantoni's calzone.    I had to dock a star bec. I found a 2"x2" corner of a cardboard container- most likely that of a frozen spinach box.  Manager was kind enough to let me enjoy my original order and comp me a second one to take home.  Hey, it was cooked in a REALLY HOT oven, so germs on the cardboard were HARMLESS.  If the oven's temperature didn't cook them, the hydrochloric acid in my stomach would, eventually.  I have to go back and get my calzone fix.  Very soon.

Caught a glimpse of this park from inside Cesar Chavez Public Library and had to check it out.  I'm glad I did!  I thought I was just going to check out what looked like a small watering-hole (I was going to say 'lake"), but it's a whole freaking park!  All this time, I thought that the lands were extensions of Cesar Chavez High School...  It's a great place to go for a stroll, or a quick cardio workout.  Wish upkeep was more consistent; Some areas are better-kempt than others.  Fishing is allowed, but remember to get those licenses, and the water does have toxic algal blooms, so don't think you can take those fishies home and have them for dinner.  If you take a good look at all that float in the water, you really wouldn't want to eat what lives in it!  Ugh! [Ooh, shivers!  And not the good kind, either!]  I keep meaning to do some interval workouts here, especially w/ the weather so beautiful nowadays...

01/31/10  Thought I'd update w/ newer pics.  Weekends pack in the multi-cultural families that live in the area.  Love how it's a lot emptier during the week.  Nightfall brings shadier-looking individuals, however, and I'm less-likely to stay past dusk :(  BTW, there is an area w/in the park that I believe was poorly-planned.  I hope that city/park officials see to its amendment soon.

Nice-looking building from the outside, w/ beautiful views of one of the man-made lakes nearby.  I really enjoyed the walks I took in the park that this branch is located in.  Using the library though, is another story.  In the times I've visited, this location was either closed or full of noisy children and pre-teens who ran in and out of its doors unattended and people of all ages who talked loudly on their cellphones.  The computer section was always crowded, and I could never find a seat to use or an empty table void of backpacks and other items left there by their absentee owners.  I'd say that, for the most part, this library looked and sounded more like a coffee shop (there's a section where you can purchase coffee and some pastries) than a quiet library where one may hope to do some productive work.  There was a good-sized selection of CDs, DVDs, and books-on-DVDs, which I used a couple of times, that allowed you to place holds on-site and online, and this service was fairly prompt at notifying me of the availability for pick-up, but I quit using the services when my hands, and anything that the items touched, started to smell of body odor from the previous users that handled them!  (I think that many of the handlers carried the items under their armpits as they walked back to the library, which I'm sure we've all done before w/ books and other items, but think about it-- we do live in the middle of the desert, and bodies do get hot and sweaty...)  No matter how many times I wiped the items down w/ sanitizing cloths and washed my hands w/ soap AND sanitized them, the odor wouldn't disappear!  Utterly disgusting, and I'm not exaggerating!  Don't believe me?  Pick up a DVD or book on your next visit and take a whiff...  Don't say I didn't warn you!!  Come for the relaxing/energizing walks and views around the lakes.  There's even a playground or two on the other end of the park for children to play in, and many picnic areas w/ grills and tables to use.   You can even go fishing!  [Just don't expect to eat what you catch, though-- the lakes are contaminated w/ toxins and algae (there are signs), and I've seen more than a few floaters and dead small animals bobbing in the water.]  If you plan to walk all of the paths, make sure you have a friend or two accompanying you, esp. around sunset, bec. there's a specific location that only has one entry and exit, which could become dangerous-- if someone's stalking or following you w/ malicious intent, well, you're S.O.L.    I hope your experiences at this library turn out better than mine!

10/16 Stumbled upon Pink Pepper as I was heading towards a second Thai option when my first option, owned by a coworker and his children, was rented out for a reception Friday evening.  I've wanted to visit PP for years, but never had a chance.  Darol (RIP), an ex-coworker, and I would exchange foodie stories of our fave places, and PP was the only place he'd go when he had a craving for Thai.  (He resided in Thailand for a few years and considered himself well-versed in the cuisine.)  So, en route to my second choice, I spotted the Pink Pepper logo in the distance and said, "Why the hell not?"  "Today's the day!"  It was very dead in there.  (Ya, not just dead.  VERY dead!  LOL.)  Besides me, I spotted my server, who must've been the owner, and an elderly woman rolling up silverware in cloth napkins.  Granted, it was around 3, 330'ish in the afternoon, and lunch had just ended at 2:30p.  (The buffet pans were still emitting heat as they cooled down.)  But I'm not one to let empty rooms sway me away, so I asked for a table.  I liked the ambience- warm, inviting, w/ lovely colors.  Loved the floral salad plates that sat at the table, which I've spotted at Sur La Table before.  Made me wish I'd splurged and bought them then.  Apparently, these plates are only used for show, bec. they were removed moments after I sat down.    Chose to skip the app course and ordered green curry w/ chicken (came w/ rice).  At $9.50,  I thought that this entree better be good!  While I waited, I checked out the rest of the menu and liked what I saw.  If the dish turned out great, I'll be coming back to check the rest out soon enough.  I also spotted a cocktails menu on the table that had quite a few good-tasting options to choose from.    My entree arrived after about 10 to 15 minutes.  The portion was smaller than I'm used to seeing for the price, so I was really hoping that I was getting a very tasty meal.  I shouldn't have worried!  Pink Pepper's green curry has placed Pink Pepper Thai pretty high on my list of places for green curry!!  (Try that for a tongue-twister!)  The coconut curry sauce was thick and super-creamy, and medium heat was just perfect for me!  I also loved the variety of veggies used- there was an extra item there that wasn't listed on the menu.  (Thank goodness I did not have any adverse reactions.)  It took all of my will AND the thought of ordering dessert to keep me from finishing the entire order!  Looking back, I could've squeezed three decent servings out of that meal, especially knowing what I know now... that Pink Pepper's homemade coconut ice cream is freaking AMAZING!  Those w/ a peanut allergy should know to alert the server of this fact, bec. this not overly-sweet sweet comes w/ a generous topping of peanuts.  Ohhh... I just got the shivers up and down my spine (the good kind!) recalling how great my meal ended!   Service was friendly and efficient, if a little lonely.  I'm going to assume it was bec. he was by himself in the front.  Perhaps w/ busier hours it'll be easier to flag someone down.  One low point was the restroom visit- the temperature was significantly warmer at that part of the building.  Consider yourself warned.

10/26/12  My first time at Hale Center Theater, to see "Annie," and I must say that I wouldn't mind driving 25 miles one-way to see another performance here!  Stadium seats flank the square stage on all sides, with the entrance from the lobby at one corner and stage exits on two corners.  This theater is very intimate, where first-row audience members will find themselves at eye-level with the performers.  Other reviewers have posted that there isn't a bad seat in this theater, but I have to disagree, at least with respect to this particular performance-- if this was a sold-out show, there would be a few attendees that would not be able to see actors perform certain scenes up in the stage balcony (for example, "You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile").  I purchased my $24 ticket for half-price (plus a once-per-transaction fee of $4) through Goldstar, and picked it up at Will-call.  Students, ages 5 through 18, may procure seats for $10 if they have their student IDs with them.  Don't forget to check in via Yelp app to get your free drink, either at the concession booth in the lobby, or from the cart that is rolled right onto the stage during the ten-minute intermissions.  I do look forward to seeing another performance here soon-- "A Christmas Carol" and "39 Steps" sound like something worth looking into...

5/27/10  Service alone deserved 5 stars!  Our server didn't even bat an eyelash when I asked for specifics on dish preparations (though, she did go to the back a couple of times to get the info), and the manager even apologized for the noise coming from the bar area due to NBA basketball finals- he even offered to move us to a quieter section if that was our wish!    We started w/ complimentary edamame, then onto the wonderful calamari http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roys-restaurant-chandler?select=nqSeC4BhUb4SVYbZlctbiw#nqSeC4BhUb4SVYbZlctbiw and continued w/ the Sweet Home Waimanalo salad (loved the creamy herb dressing- so tasty, we would've been happy to order a plate each and call it a night!), http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roys-restaurant-chandler?select=roCbXZ4rpCLb104MFuoZOw#roCbXZ4rpCLb104MFuoZOw and finally to Roy's Trio (hibachi salmon, blackened ahi, and misoyaki butterfish).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roys-restaurant-chandler?select=Y2CqA0n2v7LOl7eE2Vz8vA#Y2CqA0n2v7LOl7eE2Vz8vA  For another $4, we enjoyed a serving of macadamia nut-crusted mahi mahi, too.  These beautiful servings of fish offered about three to four bites each of pure bliss!  They came w/ their own sauces: salmon/Japanese citrus ponzu; butterfish/forbidden black rice and sweet ginger wasabi; ahi/spicy soy mustard butter; mahi mahi/lobster butter.  These bites took us through varying complex, lovely, fun aromas and flavors AND textures (from melt-in-your-mouth salmon to steak-like mahi mahi!).  We enjoyed our meal so much, it didn't feel right to order dessert.  Does that make any sense to you?  I hope so, bec. I'm at a loss to explain further!  If you haven't tried Roy's, do yourself a favor and make a reservation to visit during Restaurant Week coming up in September!

03/31/11  Had planned to partake in Fleming's happy hour (had a giftcard), but came here instead when I saw how busy it was at the bar (and I didn't want to sit outside in the heat).  I knew Roy's had a quasi-HH (free edamame-- what kind of HH is that?), so I had resigned to have Roy's tasty Waimanolo (sp?) salad.  Surprise, surprise!  Roy's now offers four food items (ahi tuna, calamari, Wagyu sliders, and beef skewers!), as well as a few wines by the glass and ALL of its signature cocktails during happy hour for $5 each!  I've tried the skewers before and wasn't too impressed, but I knew the calamari was very good, so I didn't go for that (even though I really wanted to have some).  No, what I had my eye on were the Wagyu beef sliders, w/ caramelized onions and, wait... what else did I read?  Sweet potato fries??  Oh, yeah!  My name was all over this dish!  I also placed an order for chardonnay, but I changed my mind when I saw that I could try another of Roy's signature drinks-- the last ones I'd tried many, many months ago were my espresso martini and a friend's lemon martini I'd sampled.  I was doubly-excited when I spotted Roy's Hawaiian take on the classic sidecar!  This happy hour was going to be FUN!  The Fred and Ginger cocktail did NOT disappoint!  It contained Hennessy VS cognac and Domaine du Canton ginger liqueur w/ a candied ginger peel garnish served in a martini glass.  It was beautiful to behold and so very delicious to sip!  'Twas a shame I couldn't finish the whole drink-- had to save some room for the sliders and fries (and the dessert I hadn't even planned on having later on!).  I really liked the sliders-- there were two of them, one on either side of the mini-Chinese takeout box filled w/ seasoned crispy sweet potato fries.  The sliders tasted like Whoppers (back in its heyday in the early 80's) kicked up several notches (LOVED the crispy/chewy pretzel buns!), and the fries were seasoned w/ herbs and even had a bit of cheese drizzle here and there!  I would definitely order the cocktail and app again, and for $5 each, they're a steal!    (I almost did not want to yelp about Roy's happy hour, bec. I wanted to keep this a secret for a little while.)  Thinking back, the cocktail and app would've been enough to satisfy me for the rest of the day, but I didn't really want to leave Roy's just yet ( had planned to write a review or two), so I broke down and decided to try the Chocolate souffle ($9.95), Roy's take on the chocolate lava cake, but w/ homemade vanilla bean ice cream and a raspberry coulis.  This item is baked to order, so if you are on a time limit, you should place your order in early, as it takes about 20 minutes to bake.  Was it worth the wait?  Hmm...  I liked the outer edges of the chocolate cake, which had the chewiness of a soft, fresh-baked brownie.  The lava center was definitely gooey and rich, and it tasted like hot brownie batter.  I think I'd have enjoyed the cake and its lava center a lot more if the accompanying vanilla ice cream was of a better quality.  I didn't care for its texture (not creamy enough), nor its flavor (vanilla bean specks were absent and the vanilla essence wasn't strong enough).  This dish cost as much as the app and cocktail combined, and I didn't think it was worth the price.  Can't wait to go back here for HH w/ friends!

Thought I reviewed this place already.  Since it's been about a year and a half since I last ate here (twice visited, ate once), I plan to give SK another try very soon.  Thought I'd just get the ball rolling now...  I met with a few people here the first time, but wasn't feeling hungry enough, so I just joined in the conversations and just observed the food as they were delivered to the table.  Most of my companions that night didn't actually order sushi, and instead, opted for Chinese dishes or Japanese noodles and other hot dishes.  The low menu prices did pique my interest, so when hunger pangs struck me a couple of hours later, I asked relatives if they wanted to join me for sushi (and they did).  As noted in the number of stars I posted above, I was not impressed with the rolls/nigiri I tried that evening.  I found the sushi (vinegared rice) lacking in the flavor department, and the roll ingredients to be subpar.  The selections we shared between us were so bland, I can't even recall which rolls and nigiri we had ordered!    Since it's been almost two years, and a lot can change in two years (for good or bad), I will be back to give Sushi Ken another try.

I bank here quite often and usually have no complaints.  However, I recently had to see a notary (free service to BoA clients) and had to wait more than 30 minutes for one to assist me w/ a special circumstance (the first bailed out FAST when she learned that it wasn't going to be a quick seal stamp and signature).  I ended up having to leave in order to make it to another appointment in Tempe in time.  Thank goodness there was a BoA branch right on Mill Ave!  A notary named Chris was able to assist me w/o making me feel like I was inconveniencing her!

Clean, brightly-lit, and organized.  The clerk behind the counter was pretty, poised, neatly-dressed, friendly, upbeat, and communicated well.  Great location within the mall.  I like!!  Current deals are "Buy three, get two free; Buy two, get one free; and Buy one, get the second half-off."  Was able to find Mom's favorite body butter scent, as well as the matching shower gel in a gift set complete with matching bath glycerin soap for $20.  I found out too late that the scent comes in a jumbo bath gel (originally $15).  With the current deal, I could've chosen two body butters for $36 ($18 each) and received the jumbo bath gel for free.  However, my Mom can take the bath soap on her next trip and not worry about potential spills, so everything worked out fine.  :)

6/8/11  I give See's 5 stars just for offering a sample of their chocolates everytime someone enters the store!  Today was extra-special, bec. I was given a choice (!) of a raspberry-filled nutty truffle, or a dark chocolate walnut, and I chose the walnut.  The two walnut pieces offered to me were fantastic!  I'm a crunch-junky AND a lover of dark chocolate, so these dark-chocolate walnut confections had me enamored.  I was almost tempted to buy some, but I was here to procure some chocolate bars for my nephew and sister to enjoy when Mom hands them over upon her arrival in Charlotte on Friday.  See's offers many  chocolate bar varieties, including milk chocolate, milk chocolate w/ almonds, milk chocolate w/ toffee bits, dark chocolate w/ almonds, and extra-dark chocolate.  All 1.5 oz. bars are priced at $1.55, plus tax, w/ the exception of the extra-dark chocolate, which I believe costs $2.05 (plus tax).  These are pricey, but they're of very good quality-- I love the dark chocolate w/ almonds myself!  Oh, how I wish I could have more of those dark chocolate walnuts!  (Psst!  Two one-pound gift certificates, great for gift-giving, are available through Costco for $26.99!  A good deal, as I think the confections here go for $16.99 a pound.  These little morsels may be packaged (boxed) in quarter-pound increments, as well as in cute See's logo paper candy bags, in as little, or many, as you want.  Gift-wrapping, complete w/ elastic gold band and card, is available, for free!)

Awesome white pizza!  I still dream of those mounds of ricotta!  Price-y at $15 plus tax for an 8" pie, but recommendable.  I liked the eggplant rollatini, but it was too salty, so I won't be ordering that again.  Ooh, but what I wouldn't do to have a slice or two of that white pizza again...   (If only Miele's would serve whole wheat pizza crusts like Nello's, I might be persuaded to bump the review up to 5 stars.)

08/12/11  Found a few beautiful blouses and a wonderful floral embroidered skirt from the sale racks here last week.  However, after wearing one of the blouses for a few hours (two, at the most) one day, I noticed terrible pilling (almost lint-y, as if someone emptied the dryer's lint guard and brushed it against the blouse, where the blouse then acquired a layer of lint on it).  I figured if this happened to one of the two blouses of the same fabric, then the other would eventually have the same fate, so I decided I'd return them all- even the adorable skirt, with its delicate embroidery that already made me paranoid of snagging a thread if I brushed against something, and I hadn't even tried to wear it!  The sales clerk behind the counter didn't even bat an eye and accepted all of the unused items PLUS the one I'd already worn!  What a great return policy-- I didn't expect it since I'd already worn the outfit (I was hoping!), so it really was a nice surprise.  While my luck wasn't so great the last time I bought clothing here, I'd still return and try my luck again, as the items I find are usually different than what I spot at other clothing stores.

Visited for dinner a long, long time ago, based on a positive review by a Thai coworker.    Selections were either bland, fried, or very salty.  Sushi left me wishing I was dining at Ra in Ahwatukee (and I don't even like Ra!).    I think the only thing I enjoyed was the ice cream section- mung bean I remember, but there were other flavors.  Maybe I didn't enjoy it so much.    To top it off, $14 per person for dinner that wasn't even worth $10?!?  Do yourself a favor and have a feast during happy hour at Ra!

07/20/11  2.75 stars.  Was shopping for tamarind candy and pan de sal at Lee Lee's, whiling away time before I was to meet an aunt at Mekong Plaza to dine at one (or two) of the food kiosks there, when I received a text from her saying she'd been in an accident.  Dropping everything, I met her at the scene.  An hour and a half later (she's not hurt, and the other driver was ticketed), I was starving for nourishment and aunt was not, so we headed back to the Lee Lee plaza to wait for her ride.  I was craving for noodles and was heading to Pho Van, when we walked by Phoenix Palace and decided I'd give it another try, as aunt gave it a green light, and I remembered from reading "recent" reviews that it was under "new"  management.  (Last time I visited was two years ago.)  A child host greeted and sat us at a booth.  (OK, she's Asian, so she probably was 13 years old... I know how it is... when I was 18, people thought I was 12, and now I'm... well, let's just get back to the review, shall we?)  We both ordered water, and I studied the menu.  After about ten minutes, the server that kept walking by our table finally approached to ask if I we were ready to order.  I asked if the BBQ pork lo mein came w/ vegetables.  He said that the chow mein had mushrooms, but the lo mein would not have any veggies.  "No veggies?," I asked.  Can you add some?  He said, after some thought, "bok choy," and I said yes.  I also asked if broccoli and snow peas can be added.  He said OK.  "No celery, or carrots, OK?"  He nodded yes.  I also ordered a batch of crab puffs.  The crab puffs arrived 15 minutes later, all golden-brown and smelled wonderful.  I liked the crunch of the fresh-from-the-fryer wonton wraps, but found that the sweetened cream cheese and crab filling too sweet.  I decided to eat a couple before the entree and save the rest for dessert.  (I found that I enjoyed the crab puffs more when I thought of it as a dessert, and not as an appetizer.)  The lo mein arrived four minutes after (19 minutes after time of order), looking delicious, but definitely cooked w/ carrots.  I didn't complain and let the matter drop.  I'd only expected bok choy, broccoli, and snow peas; Instead, I saw bok choy, carrots, cabbage, bean sprouts, spring onions, and garlic!  The exclusion of broccoli was A-OK- I hadn't really wanted it in there; I just didn't want "just bok choy."  The dish was very good!  Loved the sauce that it was sauteed in, though the BBQ pork was a little too fatty for my taste- I worked around it.  What I really didn't enjoy were the pieces of bitter bok choy.  Some were sweet, and after finding two bitter chunks, I thought I'd see if there was a reason why they were bitter.  A-ha!  Those that were bitter were bites close to bases of the stalks, which had particles that looked like dirt, while those that tasted sweet were cubed pieces, or stalks that didn't contain those dirt-like particles (see photos).  Needless to say, I felt less-enthused about the noodles after that.  Back to those crab puffs!  Server was unobtrusive, but could be found, if I needed him.  The woman who gave me the ticket and my fortune cookie was very sweet...  OK, Phoenix Palace.  One more strike in a few months, or maybe two years, and you're out!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g?select=ygt_oEC7K_ukEGlFdMWpow http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g?select=f7Ci-_b6cb0BZg3QgvZHYg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g?select=PHZJQhzvrwBhmsxWV5aYDg

I've eaten here many times since it opened years ago.  I loved my first visit so much, I took my Mom and her husband for dinner there a few days later!  His fave meal there is the buffalo meatloaf w/ sautéed mushroom gravy w/ sides of parmesan mashed potatoes and spiced pecan green beans.  LOVE the spiced pecan green beans!!  My Mom and I adore the seafood entrees served here; she especially loves the tempura-battered shrimp w/ tortilla slaw, FANTASTIC mango habañero chutney and huge steak fries.  I regularly order the pecan crusted trout, w/c comes w/ cilantro peach salsa and tortilla slaw.  While the peach salsa is so tasty and the slaw delicious and marvelously crunchy, my  allergies prevent me from enjoying them, so I always ask for substitutions of mango habanero chutney and spiced pecan green beans, the latter being so sinfully good!!  [According to the restaurant's online nutrtitional guide, It's also calorific AND loaded w/ saturated fat, but hey, I don't smoke tobacco or "creative" cigs, nor do drugs, and I rarely drink (yeah, what fun am I to have around, eh?), so I allow myself occasional splurges w/ certain foods!  So you see, my allergies are blessings of sorts...]  In the appetizers menu, the lobster spinach queso, coconut shrimp, chicken quesadilla, CRABCAKES, and chicken tortilla soup are all scrumptious!  (Yes, I enjoyed many of these items before I learned that the awful cramps and other seemingly crazy and non-sequential symptoms I'd experience afterwards were caused by food allergies!)  Desserts here are also pretty amazing.  Try their seasonal bread puddings!!  I've tried two versions- one w/ white chocolate and another w/ liquors of dark chocolate and bourbon, perhaps?  I also enjoy a few appetizers offered at half-price during happy hour: buffalo wings, sliders w/ french fries, onion rings, and RIBS!  If you like citrus-y beverages, try Firebirds' signature martini, the Double Black Diamond- fresh pineapple steeped in citrus vodka and garnished w/ a pineapple slice!    I did make a phone call about a month ago and found that HH appetizer selections have changed to reflect the seasons, so you may want to call ahead if you're like me and suffer from food allergies...  Last, but not least, while table and bar services here can be very spotty, management usually does a fine job w/ follow-ups and corrections.  I also enjoy the ambience here... reminds me of wonderful childhood memories of summers spent in Baguio, the summer capital of Luzon.  Woods, everywhere!  Beams, tables, chairs, floors, restrooms...  There's even a nice fireplace!

Visited for a late lunch last week and tried the Steak Au Poivre.  It came sliced, with an amazing peppercorn cream sauce and choice of potatoes (default is either baked potato or mashed, but I chose fries).  Delicious table bread and butter.  Friendly and attentive service.

04/25/13  After having bookmarked this back in '09, thanks to Donald S.'s review, and solidified by Shannon M.'s '10 review, I finally made it around to VSC!  I stopped by once, about three years ago, when I finally left the west side and moved into Scottsdale, but I'd already eaten and the shop was closing, besides..  But today I decided I'd finally see what the hype was all about.  Came in to find Dave and Jodi hard at work making to-go orders.  How did I know?  Because the two women seated outside were already finished with their meals, and the lone guy inside was also eating away, and yet there the two were, busy as bees, but not too busy that Dave couldn't greet me welcome.  Nice folks. these two.  Even though I already knew which two to try today, having checked out the menu online (VSC also delivers!), I asked Dave which he'd recommend, one from the "regular" and one from the "toasted."  I decided I'd go ahead with my original choices, The Long Trail http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vermont-sandwich-company-scottsdale?select=ouTCG1UqprZmqQ9D1IWD3w#ouTCG1UqprZmqQ9D1IWD3w and The Suicide Six. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vermont-sandwich-company-scottsdale?select=MDYibHOcAdT1uROAAvzn-g#MDYibHOcAdT1uROAAvzn-g  These combos came with my choice of salad or chips, so I went with two salads and different dressings (creamy ranch and chunky blue cheese, both homemade).  I also checked out the cookie basket and asked which ones he had today, and when I heard "maple bacon," I knew I had to try it for myself since I'd read a few reviewers raving on and on about them.  The Cranberry-apple-oatmeal also sounded interesting.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vermont-sandwich-company-scottsdale?select=KjxXF_lpOLDuIL23cpwMaQ#KjxXF_lpOLDuIL23cpwMaQ  Both sandwiches were delicious!!  If I had to choose which of the two to re-order again in an instant, I'd go with the Suicide Six, only because of the toasted texture of the bread.  Soft white bread really doesn't do much for me, and when I brought these sandwiches to work for two lunch meals, I made sure to toast the soft bread, as well.  (The leftovers really held together well, and I could definitely see myself ordering from VSC again, maybe next time via delivery to see how the service is like.)  The Long Trail http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vermont-sandwich-company-scottsdale?select=NwYaqmhI_tVZVBVrz7Rygg#NwYaqmhI_tVZVBVrz7Rygg was comprised of house-prepared roast beef,  Muenster cheese, peppery horseradish mayo, romaine lettuce, tomato slices, (light) red onion, and crumbled bacon on sourdough bread that was custom-made by a local bakery specifically for VSC.  I asked Dave to omit the green bell peppers and dill pickle chips.  (He forgot to omit the green bell peppers.)  The Suicide Six http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vermont-sandwich-company-scottsdale?select=qGzfJr5e_PEmzmdd_TRqTw#qGzfJr5e_PEmzmdd_TRqTw panino consisted of cheddar, Muenster, and blue cheese, as well as mapled turkey, honeyed ham, roasted red peppers, banana pepper and jalapeno slices, (light) red onion, and tomato slices in focaccia.  This sandwich was just what I was looking for today, and I certainly will make it one of the choices I'm going to order next time!  The Cranberry apple oatmeal was very, very good-- perfectly sweetened, very moist and tender, yet had enough of a chew to make my mouth happy!  So many flavors melded together: cinnamon-y apple, brown sugar, tart cranberries, and hearty oatmeal-- I'd choose this cookie again in a heartbeat!  The "maple bacon" cookie actually was peanut butter, and I went back to exchange it (I ate at a table outdoors**), since I'm allergic, but Dave told me to keep it and give it to someone else, as well as take two of the snickerdoodles (one for me, and one for me Mum).  I really am not a fan of sugar cookies, but this cookie was very tender (all of the sugar cookies I've tried were rock-hard-- ugh!) and had a really intense milky flavor, and if you are familiar with the very popular Filipino sweet "pastillas de leche," you'll know just how this cookie almost tasted like to me.  I would also compare it to the sweet milky goodness of a great tres leches cake.  Yeah, Dave and another customer didn't steer me wrong on this one.  **The table wasn't very clean-- one of the four cons on this trip (the other three being Dave forgot to omit the green bell pepper, a flammatory food and was confused with the cookies he had in the basket-- not an option for those who are deathly allergic to certain foods, and thank goodness my allergies aren't deathly acute!!); and the homemade salad dressings needed more seasoning- they were a bit bland.  On the upside, I appreciated the salads' ingredients-- it's been a very long time since I had bean sprouts on a salad, and these also had a couple varieties of croutons garnishing them.

We all know that Costco's good for all of our bulk-item needs; I come here for Maranatha Natural almond butter (made with only dry roasted almonds, no added salt or sugar), clothes detergents (biodegradable) and fabric softener liquids (not-so-biodegradable), deliciously sweet and juicy cantaloupe (three in a mesh case for $6), Starbucks-roasted Kirkland-brand coffee beans, and the occasional  big box of Quaker quick-cooking oats (not those microwaveable packets of oats that have had the health-promoting fiber stripped off so that they cook faster).  I'd say the most frequent item I buy here is the bottled water- I keep a few in the freezer and fridge for future trips (I know, I know... I've been told and I've read somewhere that it isn't the best thing to do, but when you live in the desert, it's kinda necessary, y'know?).  Those 36-roll bath tissues and 12-roll individually-wrapped paper towels I bought a few months ago are running low, so I'll be heading back there in about a month or two to replenish them...  So, yes, there are bulk goodies to be bought here, but did you know that, as of yesterday, I am a happy owner of two 2-lb containers of fresh red and juicy ORGANIC strawberries for $6 each??  Just ate three luscious (and huge!) berries with some whole-wheat pancakes I whipped up using organic eggs also purchased here.  Too bad Costco doesn't sell organic condensed milk (I bought mine from nearby Whole Foods)... Shoot, Costco doesn't sell ANY condensed milk- what's up with that?  With all of the milky and decadent desserts (think Tres Leches cakes and flans) our valley's restaurants offer up, you'd think Costco would sell them to their customers.  (I make "leche flan" using eggs, condensed milk, evaporated milk, and sugar.)    Another item I am very happy to have purchased here is the Viva bottom-loading water cooler/dispenser.  No more warm-ups with push-ups and lunges just so that I can lift a bulky 5-gallon water jug to fill top-load coolers hoping I don't spill any on the carpet!  Once in awhile you'll hear the dispenser's pumping system hum, but it isn't annoying.  The cooler also is lighted, so it serves as a nightlight for when you get up in the middle of the night and need a replenishing sip or two.  Kudos for Costco stocking up on more and more organic foodstuffs and biodegradable cleaning solutions/solvents.  Wonder what I'll find on my next visit?

Three-packs of Flonase on sale for $40 (3 x 120 sprays), valid till 3/28/16.  Just started using Flonase to help alleviate seasonal allergy symptoms.   It doesn't work on all allergies- understandably,  since allergens lock onto different cell receptors, but it's helping to mitigate most of my symptoms right now.  I spotted a few other nasal sprays and allergy pills in the health and beauty department.    I've missed watching indie films at the now-closed Camelview 5 theater, since tickets cost only $9 there (students and seniors could access into additional savings).  The new Harkins Camelview charges $14 per ticket for regular movies, and if you want 3D, the price jumps to $17.  Discounted senior tickets are $6 regular and $13 (?) for 3D.  If you buy Harkins tickets in advance at Costco, though, you pay $17 for TWO tickets!  They're also valid towards 3D films shown before 6 pm.  Cine Capri attendees may use them for films before 6 pm.  Hope these two tips help!

I'm here almost every weekend, stocking up on Arrowhead water, artisanal cheeses, Kirkland multi-purpose no-rub contact lens solutions, awesome gift certificates, Coach's special oatmeal, biodegradeable lavender-scented clothing detergents, and those rotisserie chickens my Mom loves so much!  Once in awhile, I lose my sunglasses, so I replace them w/ a quick stop at the optical.    Don't let the employees talk you into thinking Costco doesn't re-pack and sell previously-used items.  I've assembled a shoe-tree that had scuffmarks, opened up 42-inch HDTVs w/ footstands already bolted (usually they come unattached), and even pulled out a charger, w/ what looked like dried-up baby-milk vomit on it, from a sealed GPS system package!  But, you've got to embrace the bad w/ the good, right?  So far, the good outweigh the bad.  ATTENTION DirecTV customers: Should you need more than the one complimentary HD DVR you get at sign-up, you may purchase extra sets here for $30 less each than buying directly.  If you're looking for new wireless phones and services, stop at the wireless kiosk and have a look around.  I wish there were more options to choose from (usually one phone model per carrier.  Boo!), but at least when you do find one you like, you won't have to pay extra for a travel charger or a phone case.

I LOVE this Fry's!!  Why can't the Fry's at the corner where I live be just like this one??  Why can't it also have a:  -bulk section where I can buy chocolate-covered ginger and coffee beans, and glazed pecans?  (Granted, the prices of these items are SIGNIFICANTLY higher than the prices at Whole Foods.  Yeah, bet you didn't see that one coming!)  -a lounging area complete with leather couches, a wide-screened TV, and an attached dining area with nice-looking dining furniture and hutches?    Even the gourmet deli, cheese, and bakery sections are "jazzier" than the one at my corner of the world!  Now if you'll excuse me as I'm going to have to visit my Fry's customer service to fill out some request forms...

03/02/13  Sent a parcel to a relative through this location after visiting two other businesses, a UPS in Tempe, and the FedEx on Pima Rd, just off of Raintree and the 101.  All three gave me different quotes, which I found quite strange.  I wished I'd gone with the first quote, the Tempe UPS one (under $20), but I'd have to drive 20-some miles south again, which isn't a big deal, since I have appointments to keep in that area, anyway, but that would mean another delay, and this package was prepared back in December!  So I decided to send it out today, going with a price quote* that sat between the lowest, UPS, and the highest, the FedEx ($27).  Wouldn't you know it, but right before the clerk was about to finalize the transaction, he asked me if I wanted a signature, or if I was comfortable with leaving the package at the door.  When I said I'll go without the signature but then asked if he could wait while I called my sister to see how safe her neighborhood was (I knew it was very safe already), he commented that I do so "because, y'know you're trying to save three bucks here..."  I really didn't appreciate that sarcastic comment, but then again, my mother would never let me hear the end of it if the package didn't reach its final destination, so I paid for the extra fee, which now brought the price quote similar to the one I was given at FedEx, which suggested to me that at least the clerks at FedEx and at Tempe's UPS were giving me honest quotes, and that the clerk at this UPS location fooled me to stay with a lower quote, but then later tacked on added fees.  I left feeling dissatisfied with the whole experience, so I doubt I'll be sending out future packages from here.  * The price quote given did not include a "delivery surcharge" that was already included in the Tempe UPS quote given to me a few days prior.  Add the guaranteed signature fee, and you may perhaps understand why I'm giving a low rating.

"Drew" at the pharmacy answered all of my Mom's questions, was friendly, and even cracked a joke.  It was a very short visit, but pleasant.

Adorable shop filled with so many delicious goodies that I want to sample and take them all home with me!  Awesome Ben behind the counter assisted with ingredient info retrieval (via phone and visits to the kitchen) and sampling.  I stopped in on Friday after my Athenian Express lunch looking for Funky Monkey loaves (definitely should buy from the shop to avoid markups at Whole Foods!) and walked out with:   1.  4 fresh-from-the-oven Chocolate chip cookies and 6 also-fresh-from-the-oven Cherry-Pecan Oatmeal cookies- Great-tasting chocolate chips (reheat these in the oven back at home for messy, but lip-smacking ooey-gooey goodness!), and the oatmeal cookies are the bomb!  (This is, officially, the very first time I've uttered "the bomb" in any review... Ha!)  2.  Whole wheat dinner rolls- mildly-sweet and great both toasted and straight-from-the-bag!  3.  Challah- haven't tried, yet.  (Update:  When used in French toast, both challah and wheat challah are OK- now if only I can get the custard base recipe just right!  Mom doesn't care for the challah, and I'm lukewarm with these dough treatments, as well.)  4.  Whole wheat challah- haven't tried yet, but was told it's made from the same dough as the dinner rolls.  (Update:  Toasted, I don't like this as much as the wheat rolls, for some reason.  The flavors give off a slight grain-y taste-smell.  Imagine, if you will, scooping up some cracked-wheat berries at the bulk-bin section and taking a whiff- yeah, something like that.  It takes awhile to toast up in the toaster oven, too.   But freshly pulled apart, it's good.  Its texture is akin to that of King's Hawaiian bread, which I cannot eat anymore due to food allergies.  I don't miss it as much now that I can get wheat challah rolls!)     5.  Simply Bread Pure Honey.  The bottle should be re-labeled "Local Desert Wildflower Honey" to assist those with allergies to certain varieties.  Owners/management please note.  I like the fact that the honey is harvested from a "local" bee farm (Flagstaff).  I just wish there were more honey varietals/selections to choose from!  LOVE the taste.  Great by itself or mixed in with Kirkland-brand organic peanut butter (no added sugar, corn syrup or hydrogenated oils!) and slathered on SB's whole wheat roll!  Can't wait to visit today to pick up my orders... Please note that in observance of Passover, the shop will be closed for a week starting this Thursday, so run and re-stock your bread pantry soon!

Braved rush hour Tuesday (my one-way trip there took more than an hour!) to stock up on bread before the shop closes in observance of Passover, and left wondering why I even bothered at all- I even risked having a handyman wait for me while I fought traffic to rush home to meet with him.  I was told by Ben that Funky Monkey came in two sizes (1- and 2-lb. weight loaves), but only had the smaller loaf to purchase that afternoon.   Also, the baker there was not as helpful, nor as understanding, with my allergen ingredient questions than Ben was.  From now on, I will only visit if Ben is there to offer up a more amiable approach to customer service!  Today's purchases:  1.  Sweety Wheaty loaf ($6.99?, plus tax), sliced to order.  I specified sliced to serving size (2 oz.), and I'm glad that the machine's calibration was set so that the resulting slices were even thinner (more slices than specified serving size amount).  Gotta find ways to cut down calories!  2.  1-lb. Funky Monkey loaf ($4.99, plus tax)- I suppose the cute packaging is useful in gift-giving, but I prefer the packaging treatment given to those loaves sold at Whole Foods- first wrapped in parchment paper and taped, then wrapped again in a beautiful and classy brown bag with store logo and nutritional info decals.  Granted, those loaves I buy are of the 2-lb. variety, which incidentally are currently marked up by at least $2 ($2.50, I think)!  Definitely get these at SB.  Of course, WF' store hours are much more useful to those of us who cannot visit SB during its business hours (9a-5p) Mondays to Fridays.  3.  Tasty and gorgeous (esp. the pepper) focaccia "rolls," ($0.77 each); non-herbed and sun-dried tomato.  Both have great toothiness and surprisingly rich and complex favors, yet are a bit too salty, esp. the tomato.  The non-herbed, which touched the paper-side of the bag they were both sheathed in, did leave a HUGE grease stain (the entire width and length of the roll), which indicated a hefty amount of butter and/or oil was used in the recipe.  I'm glad to see the grease stain on the paper bag, actually, as this showed that less of the grease made it into my digestive and cardiovascular systems! ;)  The sun-dried tomato roll was touching the plastic side of the bag, so I detected less grease stains emitted, but I'm pretty sure it was also fat-laden, bec. it just tasted so buttery and simply utterly sinful!  Oh my!  I can't wait to go back and get some more (but only when Ben is there to assist me!).

04/17/13  Needed to buy dishwasher detergent and decided to try phosphates-free and biodegradable products from Costco.  However, Costco wasn't opening till 10 am today, so I headed to Target to check out its offerings (it stocks Seventh Generation products).  Upon studying the products lining Target's aisles, I decided I'd hold off buying anything there and head over to Trader Joe's to check out their natural household cleaning products, since I needed to buy more tubes of TJ's Broad spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen anyway.  (Love that this sunscreen DOES NOT smell "chemically," like Banana Boat's SPF 50 water-resistant sunscreen, and even more importantly, my face doesn't feel like it's burning upon applications of facial cleanser during my post-swim showers anymore-- the only product I switched out were the sunscreens!)  I found a box of dish detergent powder to try, as well as a small bottle of jojoba oil (to use with organic Aura Cacia oils), two toothpastes (Peppermint, with baking soda & fluoride and fluoride-free Antiplaque, with fennel, Propolis, and myrrh), Nourish Shea butter hand cream, and Nourish All-In-One facial cleanser, which promises to exfoliate, to not cause any tears (wish relationships with people would come with this guarantee!), and be rich with antioxidants.  I was in dire need of retail therapy to offset a recent terrible choice (apparently, I needed to repeat the same mistakes to finally get the lesson right!), and I wanted natural beauty to clear and revitalize BOTH my spirit and the air in my home, so naturally I searched for plants!  But I don't want clipped (read: dead) flora, as I wish to enjoy the plants for a long time, or as long as my non-green thumbs will allow, anyway, so I always try to search out potted varieties.  A past attempt at Sprout's left me without tulips, and am I glad that I waited it out, for today yielded SIX beautiful pots of orchids, mini-orchids, tulips, and ivy!  I believe these six lovely choices are enough to offset my one painful lesson I am determined to be my last (of a certain nature, anyway).  Please, oh please, let them thrive in my humble abode!    The selections available today... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trader-joes-scottsdale-2?select=ib5RHcF7aOq3p2HWieFwoA#ib5RHcF7aOq3p2HWieFwoA  My all-natural salves to help heal my spirit!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trader-joes-scottsdale-2?select=E7ND66LI-EhWpy9A-DxQ3g#E7ND66LI-EhWpy9A-DxQ3g  Last, but not least, I found an AZ-themed TJ reusable recycled bag, only $1 each.  I bought three, one to keep, and two to give away to future visiting relatives (fingers crossed!).

10/06/11  3.5 stars.  Delicious!  The menu is quite extensive, and if you cannot find what you're craving for, ask for it anyway, as the kitchen will try to accommodate you!  I asked if one is still able to bring in raw food from the market to be prepared here, and I was told yes- good to know!  Very friendly service, but I must admit I was there w/ friends related to the owners.    Clean atmosphere and very bright inside.  The tables are a bit too close to each other, I thought, but nothing that can't be adjusted if one asked the management, I'm sure.  On my next visit, I will have to remember to ask about omitting cornstarch as I did break out due to food allergies.  To those w/ MSG (monosodium glutamate) allergy, no worries here as the kitchen does not use it.    BTW, I couldn't find what I had cravings for (crispy Mongolian beef over noodles) on the menu, but after speaking w/ the matron of the house, Mrs. Leung, I was able to eat something close to it.  I did find the dish a little too salty, but it was still good.  I liked the crispiness of the noodles, as well; However, the leftover noodles didn't reheat well.  I suggest to eat your fill at the resto, or share w/ friends (which I did, but I still had some leftover)...    Hope to go back soon!

Love the pizzas here!  (I'm a thin-crust pizza lover.)  Salads are awesome, too.  Must-try app: Goat cheese-stuffed peppedews!  Desserts look tantalizing.  Fridays and Saturdays feature live musicians.    Call ahead for weekly specials, and plan to dine early for they run out of food fast!

01/13/11  It's been awhile since I last ate at Amano's Pizza Bistro, and after a strenuous, yet fun OYE circuit training session at Phoenix's FitLife, I thought I'd finally go and try one of Amano's pasta dishes, or perhaps that eggplant dish I spied an acquaintance and his wife had ordered months, maybe even a year ago.  Yeah, that and a salad...  Service was very friendly and obliging, which is always appreciated.  I was able to sample a couple of wines before choosing one to accompany my order, which ended up being the White Asparagus to start and the Eggplant Rollatini for my main.  I felt famished, so I asked if Amano offered table bread, and yes, it does-- please send them over, thanks!  The bread looked great, but they were served on the cool side... I like dinner rolls and crostini served warm.  Toasted, even.  But it was crusty on the outside, so I didn't mind.  The white asparagus app was HEAVENLY-- the asparagus spears were medium-sized and perfectly-blanched (the crunch was just splendid!), then baked w/ pancetta (the saltiness of this dish was spot-on) and, I believe, a gruyere-blue cheese (gorgonzola?) bechamel sauce.  The dinner rolls made a perfect pairing to sop up the delightful sauce.  A great app for two to share!  The eggplant rollatini was stuffed w/ ricotta, deep-fried, then topped w/ mozzarella and a tomato and garlic confit (chunky, and the acidity nicely paired w/ the sweet and salty ricotta in the eggplant- I liked it!), and garnished w/ delightful orzo and roasted veggies.  Yes, it was another "When Harry Met Sally" food-orgasm moment for me... I just had shivers go up and down my neck (the good kind!) just recalling how great this entree was!  I'm definitely going to order this again the next time I go- possibly this week!  I forgot to mention that both app and entree were delivered not by my server, but by Chef Fabian himself, which was a nice touch.  I hadn't planned on having any dessert, but my meal had me so giddy w/ delight that I had to ask my server what were being offered that evening.  She told me about the rum cake, creme brulee, and tiramisu, and they all sounded great that I had to take a few seconds to consider.  I was about to tell her what I'd decided on, when Chef Fabian magically appeared at my table w/ a beautiful plate of the tiramisu!  It was EXQUISITE!  It's rare that I get to try tiramisu when I see it on the menu, bec. most often than not, restaurants prepare the mascarpone filling w/ powdered sugar.  Not at Amano's!  This version has to be the best I've ever tasted!  Dusted w/ a heavy layer of cocoa powder, the tiramisu also had delicious shavings of dark chocolate (loved the snaps made when I bit into them!) underneath drizzles of chocolate ganache...  A must-try!    Thank you to my server and Chef Fabian for a delightful meal; I foresee another visit in the very near future!

I'm still here!  4.5 stars.  (Initially wanted to give 5 stars, but an incident happened soon after I sat down, which I won't mention here, but if you're interested in finding out what, just PM me!)  Came in for dinner and found a group of people standing around the bar area.  Waiting to be seated, I finally made eye contact w/ the  group, which led to someone asking me if I was there for the art event.  I quickly said no and scanned the layout for posts regarding the art event, and there it was-- "Meet the Artist, 5p-6p, wine and apps served."  Before seating myself, I asked if I could still take advantage of the event and was told a resounding "Yes!"  Cool!  Wine was offered quickly (white Torrontes, red Montepulciano D' Abruzzo).  Server Tess told me about the white selection, but was going to get back to me about the red, which they were "changing out" at the moment.  Someone (Chef Fabian?) must've alerted her to my choice of red on my last visit, bec. Tess came back w/ a half-glass of the red.  Didn't like it though, so I asked to try the white and found it satisfactory, so she promptly brought me a half-glass of it.  (I am currently sipping on my THIRD half-glass!  LOL.)  Apps, which I was told was going to be bruschetta, took awhile to come out [around 545p, actually, and AFTER the comp table bread and JUST BEFORE I received my ribeye steak salad entree ($13), which, for the most part, looked good (the meat slices didn't look that particularly attractive) and, more importantly, tasted good, as well!  The salad is comprised of 6 oz. of ribeye, organic mixed greens, artichokes, chopped asparagus, and feta cheese.]  The delivered app was actually a rectangular slice of the Semolina crust Margherita, which had a really nice crunch and flavor for a red-sauced pizza!    I agree w/ the two recent reviewers that the balsamic vinegar is a bit too vinegary, but I just asked for butter instead, and that solved that issue for me, although I know that might not be satisfactory to those who are looking for a healthier alternative to butter...  Still vacillating on whether or not I'm to try tonight's dessert specials of Bread pudding (w/ bourbon sauce) or Hazelnut chocolate pot de creme, but I can't say that I haven't had a great time dining here, tonight!

12/22/09 What a charming, yet rustic-looking little restaurant we have here in Phoenix!  Quite a surprise to find this gem... I knew as soon as I walked through the doors that I was in for a treat :) I really liked the openness of the lay-out, which offered many views of the kitchen and its busy staff.  I had a hard time deciding where to sit, so inviting this venue is!    Came to check out their happy hour menu.  Complimentary apps consisted of olives, housemade potato chips, and cheese pizza.  I ordered a glass of St. Francis Meyer Lemonade (all cocktails reg. $9/HH $5) and helped myself to some pizza and chips.  The lemonade was a smash!  I'd love to order this drink made w/ house-infused vodka and fresh lemonade again :)  Liked the chips, but found the pizza to be cold and soggy.  When I went back to check out the olives, I noticed that the pizza had not been replaced w/ a new one and looked exactly as it did after I took a few slices... I'd suggest anyone to just skip the complimentary food and order straight from the menu.  After looking over the limited menu [apps, entrees, sides, dessert, and even a two-item kids' menus (no charge!) all on one uncluttered, easy-to-read page], I decided I'd go for the Open-faced Pot Roast Sandwich w/ broccolini and caramelized carrots.  (I'd hoped that w/ only a few entrees to choose from, that the food would be amazing.  I needn't have worried.)  While waiting for my food to arrive, I decided to order another drink, since I'd already downed the delicious lemonade; I chose the perfectly pretty purplish Prickly Ricky- a cocktail made w/ prickly pear and citrus juices, tequila, and a little beer.  Yet, another winner!  Not too sweet, and the tartness was just right.  The beer flavor was definitely there.  Nice!  The open-faced sandwich was a delight to my senses!  Loved the presentation, the flavors, as well as the different textures!  I would've preferred that the bread be served on the side, bec. what little of it that remained toasted (grilled) was very good.  (I left most of the soggy bits on the plate.)  The vegetables were simply outstanding!  How I'd wished there were more of them :)  But it's always best to be left wanting for more than to have too much, yes?  But what about dessert?  How could I possibly have room for it?  I don't know, but I certainly found some, and I'm glad that I did, for the Warm Sticky Toffee Pudding, served w/ a canela of sweet cream gelato on top, was just incredible!  So much so, I'm at a loss for words to describe it, so please forgive me if I just let the photos speak for themselves.  (I will tell you this- I left not one drop of toffee sauce on the plate!)    I will definitely be back!

10/19/10 and 01/02/11  Took Mom w/ me for her first visit to St. Francis (and my second!) for a late lunch around 1p.  The place was packed, and as usual, very noisy.  Thought perhaps I'd finally get a chance to see how the seating was upstairs, but we were seated on the main floor.  Even though we were seated right away, it took more than 10 minutes before our server finally greeted us.  Even though I knew what I'd order for us both, I let Mom look over the limited menu-- for once, the lengthy downtime worked to our advantage!  She almost went for the lunch combo (soup, salad, and half of the Del Real sandwich), but in the end, we ordered the two items I already had my eye on before we'd left home (love to read menus online!).  We decided to share the French onion burger and the Red wine braised beef, and both came w/ a choice of fries or red quinoa salad, so we chose one of each.  The burger was a beauty!  On a substantial and gruyere-smothered patty lay greens, smoked bacon, and crispy shoestring onions, and these were all topped w/ a gorgeous bun!  We wouldn't hesitate to order this one again!  While the fries looked very promising, they were soggy, but Mom happily ate them.  I had the Red wine braised beef sandwich and the red quinoa salad to contend w/, so I didn't bother sending the fries back.  :)  We both loved the quinoa salad-- what a pleasant surprise!  Red quinoa is very good for you-- high in fiber AND protein.  A superfood, indeed!  The key to this salad was the citrus vinaigrette.  A must-try!  The braised beef was also very, very good!  That is, when we finally tried it w/ the horseradish sauce, which somehow was overlooked while Mom and I were divvying up the entrees.  Panini-style, between two slices of their Texas toast, buttered, and gruyere cheese.  DO NOT forget the horseradish sauce, as it just makes the flavors pop in your mouth.   --- When I'd learned that Dennis Rowland was in the house during Sunday brunch, I couldn't wait to go to SF on a rare Sunday off work!  Again, it was a packed house, and I finally was seated upstairs.  Oh my Lord, what a horrendous place to be!  While I could hear Rowland and his band play (it's actually less noisy up there- go figure), I couldn't see them, what w/ the rafters and the ceiling fans underneath, and the cork flooring made every footstep coming and going annoyances I couldn't wait to get rid off by finally leaving!  Thank goodness the two entrees I'd ordered made up for these... hiccups.  Liked the Iron skillet pancake (w/ dark chocolate chips and fresh raspberries), but thought the kitchen was a little light-handed on the chips-- please add more!  Also, I found the pancake was charred too much.  I thought it was bec. it was skillet-style, but I spied another table that received a perfectly un-charred one.  Really enjoyed the creme fraiche and fresh raspberries (please add more!), and the honey on the bottom of the pancake was delightful!  A great dish, really, even w/ the charred bits...  As for the house made biscuit-- well, one look at it and who could ever argue that it wouldn't taste grand??  Crazy-good fennel herb veggie gravy.  Yes, I said "crazy-good."  There's a first time for everything!  :)    Two very good meals which will keep St. Francis on my (long) rotation list!  (BTW, I think I heard Mom sigh when I told her where I was having brunch while she was getting ready work... I really wished I could've taken her w/ me!)  p.s.  Not only did I not get a chance to SEE Rowland and his band play, but for the majority of my stay, the band actually took a break!  No doubt they were all enjoying some of the great-looking cinnamon rolls...  Next time, I'm going to wait for a table to open on the main floor.  That cork flooring upstairs has to go!

Late last night, I read that it was Food Truck Day @ WF Raintree today, so I made sure to work up an appetite before driving the mile or so to check it out.  The line-up consisted of Jamburritos, vegetarian Beet StrEat, La Carte Blanche Gourmet Tacos, Short Leash Hotdogs, Sweet Republic, & Torched Goodness.   (Phoenix Cheesesteak Co. was MIA.)  Thinking it was fate that I was supposed to try my very first Short Leash meal today after having missed out on yesterday's pop-up, I sought the truck out to place my order, only to find that there was a line of about eight people.  If it weren't 100 degrees out there, I wouldn't have minded waiting; Instead, I went to next-door neighbor La Carte, which just cleared its latest customer just as I approached.  Delighted that I could mix-and-match two for $7, or get one for $4, I chose the Pork carnitas with sweet potato-pineapple relish & the Steak taco with arugula, pine nuts, and avocado salsa, hold the pine nuts & avocado (allergies).  I'd asked the affable male cashier if the preparation would take five minutes or so, and he said "Not even that... more like two minutes."  I backed up a few steps to study SL's menu again to while away some time, only to have the kind man sneak up next to me and say "I lied... forty seconds," while handing over the filled flour tacos.  I was thankful to find a clean, empty table about four feet away to eat my treasures as I watched the line @ Short Leash lengthen (with people unhappy of the heat).  I enjoyed both tacos very much, thank you; I couldn't pick a favorite, as both differed in a variety of ways: the pork was shredded, thus almost melt-in-your-mouth tender, while the steak was chunky, requiring more chewing action- a good thing!  The pork was sweet due to the relish, while the steak had an acidic quality to it, and both had a little kick from a few spices.  (After a minute or two of dining under a tent outdoors, I headed into Whole Foods to cool off & found a little area cleared for attendees of the event- nice!)  After a few minutes, I was ready to brave the heat in search of sweets, so I walked out of WF, headed straight to Sweet Republic and said hello to Jan, who recalled that I was allergic to corn and steered me away from the sorbets (which contain corn syrup).  After letting me sample the Blueberry-pomegranate (frozen yogurt), Medjool date, Madagascar vanilla, & Honey-lavender ice creams (all delightful!), I ordered a double-scoop of Honey-lavender & Belgian chocolate, $4.75.  (I wanted two of the four I'd sampled, but Jan recommended the chocolate pairing.)  I hope to find more food truck events here... lunch was delicious, and so much fun!

I thought I'd update my reviews here by mentioning that there will be an ice cream social event on Saturday, July 27th, from 2p to 5p, or so an e-newsletter informed me this morning!  I clicked on the Facebook link https://www.facebook.com/wholefoodsto get more information, which led me to a WF website link that stated "all Whole Foods" will be participating.  I wish I could go, because not only will WF have their own brand of ice cream on-hand, but one of my favorite organic brands, Three Twins, is going to be featured, and both email and website state that for every Three Twins purchase made, one dollar will be donated to the Non-GMO Project!  To find out more this organization, please visit http://nongmoproject.com.  The website mentioned all WF stores are participating, but that "some stores might have sweet concoctions up their sleeve like sundaes, shakes, floats and malts and many are planning fun events for kids and adults alike..."    Wish I could attend the event myself, but I'll be at work, so for those of you planning to attend, just have an extra tablespoon of ice cream for me!  :)  Read more about the event here http://wholefoodsmarket.com/blog/youre-cordially-invited-ice-cream-social-july-27?sf15241907=1

Love this theater!  Wished I'd known sooner that I could get parking tickets validated (up to 4 hours!).  Nice wide lobby, clean and bright concession stands and restrooms, and clean stadium seats.  What more can you ask for?

3/2/11  I've wanted to try this place since a coworker suggested it to me back in December.  I trusted his judgment since he also mentioned liking Pomo, which I've bookmarked to try a LONG time ago, when Yelp was all a-buzz about how great the pies were THERE.  I could never locate Jimmy & Joe's though, when I was hungry for pizza.  I'd always see the sign from the road when I had just eaten, or was on my way to another restaurant, but today I actually wrote down the cross-streets so that I would finally get to try their Gourmet cheese.  Since I usually get a cheesy no-sauce pizza, I try to get my veggies in by either adding aritchokes or, even better, asparagus (extremely rare to find at pizza joints, but I have ordered pizzas w/ it before!), but today I decided I'd have a Greek salad, which included mixed greens and romaine lettuce, chopped tomatoes, pitted whole kalamata olives, sliced red onion, and feta.  I was very hungry, which might have prejudiced me into really enjoying the salad.  It was so HUGE!  Even after I had more than my fill of it, there was still so much left-- it almost looked like I hadn't touched it!  I found the feta to be creamy enough not to use much of the delicious blue cheese salad dressing.  Warning: I thought that all of the saltiness I detected came from the olives.  I was wrong-- a lot of it came from the feta itself, which I detected later on, when I had more of the salad after arriving home.  Just thought I'd warn you, in case this was an important issue...  The pizza arrived about 15 minutes after I ordered it.  First thing that struck me is that it had tomato sauce on it!!  What??  I wondered what made me think it was going to be all-cheese?  Oh, well.  The chunks of ricotta looked promising, so I let the matter of the sauce go.  I initially thought the crust was going to be perfectly-crisped, but I very soon found out that this pizza is VERY doughy!  Whatever crunch I found didn't last very long.  The sauce was also VERY salty-- a fact that another coworker highlighted when I told him I didn't care for the pizza at Jimmy & Joe's.  We actually chimed "It's too salty" in stereo!  I found that funny :)  The different cheeses (mozz, ricotta, provolone, and parmesan) didn't really translate into great flavor, either.  There was too miuch stringy mozzarella, and I couldn't even taste the provolone.  This pie had "FAIL" all over it!    At least dessert was OK- I really wanted to try the chocolate cake, but since no one had the ingredient info, I had to pass on it, and instead, I went for the Grandma's Black Cookie, which was essentially a chocolate chip cookie w/ walnuts and oatmeal.  This cookie was so big, it spanned the whole length of my open hand!  I really enjoyed its flavors, as well as its textures- crunchy outside and moist and chewy interior.  A bit too salty in the end, though, but it tasted really great accompanied by a cup of "super-charged," yet burnt Circle K coffee just around the corner...  Customer service was friendly enough, if a little ill-prepared when it came to answering some of my questions: Are the veggies used fresh or canned?  "Don't know."  (Although the kitchen was able to answer, after I'd asked the girl at the counter to go and ask.)  Are the salad dressings made in-house?  "No.  Everything's from a bottle, but we do make our own BBQ sauce."  O-K...  If you sign up for their emails, you can get coupons or SMS texts to use at J&J's.  However, good deals won't get me to stop at J&J's for a second time.  Sorry, but w/ so many other delicious options out there, I will have to pass J&J by!

Awesome chicken shawarma sandwich!  However, it came with fries, w/c were crispy and delicious, but the grease and flavor almost brought on nausea (sorry for the visual).  I hope management will allow me to substitute next time.    Noticed bags of pita for take-out in the deli section- Good Bread pita and Al-Hana whole wheat.  They do not contain *, so I'll be taking some home next time!  I'd prefer not having the deli counter visible from the dining area, though (so glaringly bright!).  Put up a divider of sorts, and this venue could easily attain great-for-a-date status!

4 stars for the flavorful Jerked chicken, veggies, and beans over rice (see photo above, taken sometime in May '08).    2-star deduction caused by my witnessing a young adult male, dressed in athletic clothes, who reeked of body odor, enter the front entrance and then proceeded to enter the kitchen area to grab food for him and his companions.  As if it wasn't enough I had to bat flies away from my table.   (But then again, for a certain number of weeks out of a year, it's hard to keep flies away ANYWHERE.  Just visit the EDR where I work!)  I shall NOT return!

My first visit and I received awesome service!  Walked in and Jonathan immediately greeted me a hello and offered his assistance.  Needed a set of three windshield wipers for Mom's car, preferably Rain-X, and was taken directly to the computer.  I commented "Oh, you don't have the book?," and Jon said "We do, but the computer is so much faster."  :)  He quickly assessed the inventory and retrieved the wipers.  Since the shop was out of the Rain-X brand for the rear wiper, I had to settle for a generic.  What really impressed me was his offer to install the wipers right then and there!  Too bad I wasn't driving Mom's car today, but I asked if the offer may be extended on a future visit, and he said yes.  "Do I need a receipt (for proof-of-purchase)?"  He shook his head.  I was blown away!  Cool prices (considering what I had paid for a complete set for my car, which matches my Mom's, except for the color) and terrific initial customer service.  I hope that my next purchase here, ideally not anytime soon, will be as great an experience as tonight's was!

07/08/10  2.5 stars.  Why not round up to 3?  'Cause I wouldn't go back for dinner.  You might be able to pay me to try their lunch buffet here, but what items I I had for dinner tonight didn't wow me enough to want to return.  Indeed, the course I liked best was dessert!  And I'm at the point in my life now that if I'm going to splurge on anything, then it must be high-quality.  Our "feast" included crablegs (too skinny and cold); frog legs (too greasy and soggy); gyoza/pan-fried pork dumplings (wrapper was perfect in its thin-ness, but flavor-wise, not memorable); eggrolls (took one bite, thought it stale and greasy in flavor, and moved on); sashimi (most pieces were either too tough or still-frozen!); sesame-crusted ahi-tuna (overpowering fishy taste!); crab-stuffed, then baked oysters (delightful in its glorious saturated-fat goodness, and my fave out of the mains!); and clams (too gritty).  Most of the desserts were good, and my faves were the green tea ice cream and mung bean buns, especially those that were sesame-encrusted!    If the seafood could've been just a little bit fresher and a little less fishy, and the fried items a little less greasy, then maybe dinner wouldn't have been so disappointing.  With so many dining options out there, I see no reason to return.  Well, maybe for a scoop of green tea ice cream!

I used to recommend Lemongrass to everyone I'd meet whenever I'm asked "where do you go for great Thai food?"  My Thai coworkers told me to check this place out, and this I did on the cafe's first week.  I RAVED over their food- pad woon sen, pad thai, tom kah soup, all curries.  A coworker who visited the cafe twice reported back that while he enjoyed the food, he didn't think the cafe would do well since each time he visited (he went twice many many moons ago), business was very slow.  I also reco'd the cafe to a few people connected with the Vegetarian Society, who soon gathered there for a dinner which I couldn't attend.  The event was a success.  Another coworker refuses to try another Thai resto since I've turned him onto LTC.  Why should he try another when he can get the food he loves cooked the way he wants it here?  Amen, and LTC has me to thank for his business every time.  Then one night, many, many months ago, I had called and placed a couple orders, like I've done a few times before, so that the entrees would be ready for me by the time I arrived from work.  I previously gave the owners/cooks a list of food allergies, which I again went over on the phone.  Imagine, then, my disappointment to find that they'd added an ingredient we had not agreed on on a dish that, had it not contained tofu, I would have taken home for my Mom to enjoy (I like tofu, she doesn't).  The cook who decided to use the ingredient took offense when I had sent the dish back.  I told the co-owner/host that I would gladly take the $8 dish home, only I couldn't since no one would be able to eat it, and that I'd like gladly pay for another dish if I could order something else.  In the end, I wasn't charged for the dish and service, once offered profusely every time I walked into that cafe, was non-existent from that time forward.  All this over an $8 item.  I didn't visit the cafe again for two months until a coworker told me that the friendlier co-owner was asking for me to come visit again.  I did, but, LTC, "you've lost that loving feeling."  It used to sadden me that I couldn't enjoy the great flavors LTC used to offer, but I've since found a handful of other places that offer equivalent, if not better, dishes!    I do wish the owners/cooks all the best in their venture, as they can provide delicious dishes at LTC.  I just hope they do not treat many of their customers as they did me.

Ate here months ago.  Was excited to finally find a Phoenix sushi venue, and one that also offered brown rice as a sub for sushi dishes (don't quote me on this however, since it has been many months and I may be recalling another venue).    One item did impress me, and that was the complimentary appetizer that was comprised of tempura'd chips with perhaps a squid salad topping (?)  I should have just ordered another serving of this!  Instead, I tried an Ao Yasai (mixed gourmet greens with ginger) and a sushi roll w/ brown rice, the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given.  I was so unimpressed by its unexciting flavors that I don't even recall what kind of roll I tried!  Pretty sad, I know.    I told myself I wouldn't go back, but I would like to give Hana another try, perhaps for lunch and/or dinner with a group of friends and have apps and wine/sake!

It sang to us its beautiful lullaby before we spotted it- a lovely waterfall at the restaurant's entrance!  It was a little chilly that evening and I had a feeling that Mamang wouldn't be open to dining al fresco, but I asked for patio seating.  When I spotted a few heaters in place, I knew we'd be fine.  What a delightful surprise when we scored a table next to the babbling waterfall we encountered on our way in!  Nervous energy spent over Mamang feeling too chilled outside was wasted; Indeed, she even complained of feeling too warm!  No worries though, as cousin Melissa eagerly swapped places with grandma.  We shared flaming saganaki, "award-winning" gyro dinner (consisting of lamb and beef, scrumptious rice, sauteed veggies, and just-perfect lemon-roasted potatoes), side Greek salad, and flaming galaktoboureka (custard baked in crusty phyllo, topped with vanilla ice cream, flamed, then drizzled with caramel sauce) for dessert!  We three over-ate, but no one grumbled.  Mamang had never experienced Greek cuisine before, so this beautiful evening (outdoor dining, ambience- lighted palm trees, waterfall- and tasty food) was a perfect send-off for our gorgeous grandmother, who was homesick living on US soil for the past six months.  She left for Manila yesterday (Monday).  I hope she's happier back home... Mamang, next time you're enjoying a fresh mango shake, I hope you'll think of me!  I'll be there in spirit sipping on another next to you :)  1st con: Poor lighting.  Firstly, my eyes can't feast on the beauty that I'm about to savor.  Secondly, photos taken will most likely be ruined.  Thankfully, my cousin's digital cam had better flash.  Please refer to photos above!  2nd con: Lackluster service.  Appetizer was served, yet we didn't have any utensils on our table.  Couldn't find our server, so I grabbed three sets from a nearby table.  Also, we almost missed the flame shows of both saganaki AND galaktoboureka.  Cousin and grandma thought something or someone caught on fire, haha (in the event of a body, not so funny); Presenter should've given us warning before setting the cheese on fire.    3rd con: Restroom was in an awful state of disarray.  Counter was wet all over, and the floor was littered with paper.  Total 180 degrees from the awesome ambience experienced on the patio (excluding the poor lighting, of course).

9/11  Finally made it out here!  While they were offering up their "Dog Days of Summer" (everyday in September offered two different gourmet hot dog selections, most of which sounded divine even though I rarely consume them nowadays) and fresh lemonade, I decided to try their bacon blue cheese burger with sweet potato fries.  While I waited for my order, I decided to check out the restroom facility to wash my hands and found, to my slight discomfort, an animation film classic "Stingray" playing on a 13" television console inside (along with showcases of Barbie and Ken on the walls).  While novel to see, as I said, this blast-from-the-past just made me want to leave the facility as fast as I could.  Something about those faces creeps me out!  This burger was SUPERB!   I cannot find fault in any of the components, from the grilled bun and perfectly-grilled patty, to the tasty homemade BBQ (a popular offering from JFG's sister company, Joe's Real BBQ) smothered on huge and crispy bacon and onion rings, to the heavenly chunky blue cheese dressing!  (Oh, that blue cheese dressing... Just give me a cup of this dressing and a straw to slurp it all up and I'm a happy camper!).  The sweet potato fries were amazing!!  Yes, I'd gladly drive 70 miles RT to order this platter of food again and again.  But, let's not forget to make room for dessert!  Hot fudge sundae lovers must try the mud sundae, a twist on the classic hot fudge sundae with malt added.  Mmmm....  It was a little busy when I arrived at 11a, and thankful I was to arrive then for the lunch time crowd was ridiculous!  Patio-seating (shaded by trees) was crowded, and indoors soon mirrored the patio, with a line threatening to extend beyond the doors (and it was so hot that day, too!)

7/07/10  Don't get me wrong, I still love JFG; I just didn't care for its BBQ pulled pork sandwich and fries.  The coleslaw was good, but not so fantastic that it's worth the pain after.  I thought that the pork had too much of the cloyingly-sweet sauce.  Wasn't so sweet when paired w/ the garlic toast points.  However, if you look at the included photo, you'll see that the two pieces of bread were under the pork, and therefore completely saturated w/ sauce.  I like accompanying bread to be crispy/crusty (love that crunch!), so all I had to enjoy that afternoon w/ the pork was the part that stuck out from under all that sauced meat!  What a waste (tsk, tsk)!  The boat of fries was just a complete soggy mess.  I should've asked them to sub sweet potato fries instead, but why must I pay extra to get a perfectly crisped product?  Then again, one (wo)man's treasure is another (wo)man's trash, and vice-versa, eh?  Today wasn't a great day for me w/ regards to Mr. Johnston's two restaurants (see my "recent" Coffee Shop review).  I hope my next visit to a Johnston concept yields a happier adventure!

07/07/10  Had coffee and some sweets here w/ a friend, and after much anticipation on trying the fare here, I was a bit disappointed w/ what I found :(  I decided I'd try a couple of scones and a berry coffee cake, and a cup o' joe.  I really enjoyed the coffee, but the pastries?  Not so much.  The coffee cake wasn't sweet enough, and I found it to be too greasy.  The scones, also a bit on the greasy side, were so flat, they looked like cookies!  Out of the two, I liked the butterscotch best.  However, I wouldn't order these again.    A few hours later, I decided I'd go back to write some reviews and have another cup of coffee.  I went back up to see if there were new additions to the display, but was turned off when I saw a couple of flies crawling over the cupcakes.  (((shudder)))  The clerk manning the counter followed my gaze and saw the flies, but didn't shoo them away.  Tsk, tsk.  Turned me off on trying anything new.  I am a big fan of Joe's Farm Grill and The Liberty Market (a little less of Joe's Real BBQ, but I've only gone there once, so a return visit may change my mind), so I'd like to give their sister company The Coffee Shop another try.  The sandwich and salad menus look delicious, but most of the selections are off-limits to me.  But... flies in the sweets counter?  I don't know if I can stomach another visit :(

7/01/10  I've had Tortas El Guero bookmarked for a couple of weeks when a friend told me of the wonderful torta she had here recently, I thought I'd visit it on my next days off.  Came in prior to 430p, and the woman manning the counter could not speak any English at all.  Good thing I still retained a little of basic Spanish to request that a few ingredients be omitted.  (Had I waited till 5p, I'd have no problem w/ the bilingual Caucasian server that arrived.)    Chose the carne asada torta, and the bread was good.  However, the filling was very sparse.  I suggest that TEG either use smaller-sized bread, or up the filling a bit!  The cost of the sandwich is definitely too high-- I wouldn't order this same sandwich for that price again (especially when I could order a huge serving that is equally as tasty, perhaps more so, at Phoenix Ranch Market-- the telera bread there is amazing!).  Indeed, I had to order two side tacos for their meat contents (pastor y carne asada) to be able to fill in the rest of the torta :(  Based on what I tried, if I were to come back, I'd order the pastor.  I don't think I'll be back, though.  (I will, however, visit the Michoacan ice cream parlor again next door!!  The coffee and mango flavors I tried were delicious!  What I wouldn't do to have some of the coffee right now...)

Had a lot of fun dousing a few super-delicious strawberries and cream puffs at the chocolate fountain during the Yelp Rocks event Thursday night... I could've swam in that chocolate fountain bobbing for cream puffs all night, I tell ya!    Here's hoping S'Bistro will be present at the next rock-some party Gabi organizes!

10/21/10  My first visit to Redendo's!  Dark wood tables everywhere, a plethora of old photographs adorned the walls, and old crooner songs played loudly overhead- I asked nicely if the volume could be turned down, and thank goodness they obliged!  Too bad a quarter of the FOH was occupied by empty pizza boxes ready to be used- what an eyesore!  The women's restroom was spacious, comfortably decorated, and, most importantly, very clean.  (I accidentally entered the men's room, and while still decorated, it wasn't as elegant as the women's, and it didn't feel as clean and fresh in there, sorry to say.)  I was craving for fettucine alfredo, but I asked server Nicole what her favorite dish was on the entire menu, and she pointed to the eggplant parmigiana and said that she and her beau split this dish all the time.  I told her I'd get one of those, but hadn't realized it was a sandwich until later, but no biggie.  I like hot Italian... heroes.  ;)  I then said I wanted pasta alfredo, and she said that was her favorite pasta dish, too [what a coincidence! ;)].  For my next visit, I already decided i was going to try the Popeye's, but I didn't tell her.  When she later revealed that it was her family's fave, I thought either we go for the same flavor combos; this young woman is reading me like a book; or agreeing w/ everything I say.  The fettucine alfredo was a beautiful sight to behold, and its garlic parmesan cream sauce was one of the best-looking AND best-tasting parmesan cream sauces (for the price) I've ever had!  Loved the two garlic mini-breadsticks that flanked the noodles, but I wish they were a little crispier.  The eggplant parm was tasty, but it's sliced VERY thin.  I would've preferred it a little bit thicker.  Enjoyed the bread, which I was told was homemade (I've got to find out for sure).  Unfortunately for me, the bread is lined w/ a cornmeal crust underneath.  This makes for a wonderful crunch, but not for a happy and feeling-good Aileen :(  Perhaps I can order their heroes w/ two sandwich tops?  Hmm...

Do you like crusty pizzas?  Do you like goat cheese and ricotta?  How about some spinach and lots of roasted garlic??  If you like white pizzas (no tomato sauce), then you HAFTA try the Popeye!    I've ordered this pie almost every week since first trying it in late Oct./early Nov. of last year.  Mom couldn't get enough of it; she was the one who'd ask me to order one for takeout at the end of every work week!  :)  She finally asked me to stop getting them late Dec./early Jan., but I never tired of it.  She recently started asking if we could go have some more pizza about three weeks ago; I just bought one last night!  The Popeye is the only variety I've tried here (it's the only white pizza they've got), but with such great flavors on a perfectly crispy crust, I don't want anything else!  p.s.  Tried the tiramisu, as well-- Ordered it to-go, but had to try a few bites at the resto.  LOL  Very nice, and not too sweet.  My two complaints were that it needed more espresso and that the slice was a bit small for the price.  (Or maybe it just didn't look so pretty when served in an aluminum bowl.)  Would I order it again?  Hmm... I'll have to get back to you on that!

10/21/12  Ordered one of my usuals, a large Popeye, for takeout.  Tonight's pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5mmF-H_4emxvultbneKFWQ?select=3Sdqi6icPQRcdiKTp1rf6g#9kvlhcd8-501LorXKJMh6g was, unfortunately, a terrible rendition- the worst I've had in recent weeks, and the worst I've had from Redendo's since I started dining here two years ago.  (Wow!  I hadn't realized, until now after looking through my reviews, that tonight's visit marked a date exactly two years from the day I first ate here!)  I had just clocked out of work and called Redendo's to place my order in, and the timetable given from ordering to pick up is 20 minutes, so I swung by a nearby drugstore to return some unused merchandise.  By the time I arrived, it probably was closer to thirty minutes since I got off the phone.  A young man I'd recognized as having taken down an order wrong a few weeks ago handed me the pizza box and stated that he had made the pizza himself, which struck me odd since I only knew him to man the register, answer the phone, or retrieve orders/entrees from the back.  Whoever hands me my pizzas usually shows me the finished product before I pay for it, so he opened the box and I just took note of the spinach and the ricotta and said it looked great and hoped that his creation tasted just as good as it looked.  I tore into the box as soon as I arrived home and from the first bite, I already knew that this was a subpar product.  A couple of months ago, I started to request "light on the mozzarella and heavy on the ricotta," but tonight I forgot to specify this, so I was delighted to find that this pizza had a lot of ricotta on it.  However, the mozz AND the goat cheese were completely absent from this product!  There was, however, a LOT of garlic.  If you look at the photo included, you'll see there's a lot on the pizza and on the box that have fallen off of the two slices I popped into the toaster oven, and I assure you that there were PLENTY on those slices.  It was pretty obnoxious, but I persevered and ate the garlic pieces, which were much thicker than normal.  I know garlic is good for the health, and I'm still recovering from a very recent upper respiratory infection, so I decided to overlook this oversight tonight.  Unfortunately, I couldn't ignore how awful it was the next night, as the pizza tasted even worse (very bland), so much so that I couldn't even enjoy the rest of it.  It's very important to note that on both nights I ate this pizza I also suffered from headaches.  I've never suffered headaches after eating pizzas from Redendo's before, so this was also unpleasing.  I wondered if the new guy added something to the pie.  I wondered why he even made the pie himself, and not the regular cook/chef?  If no one was able to create and bake a pizza worthy of Redendo's reputation, of which I've testified to in my reviews and by word-of-mouth, why not just tell me on the phone?  I could've ordered something else.  I could've spent $25 (including tip) on other entrees and not on this disastrous Popeye interpretation...  I am very sorry not to be able to partake in the pizzas, calzones, and chicken fettuccine Aflredo entrees from here in the future anymore, since I now cannot trust the quality and presentation of the products served here, but I thank Redendo's for the great pizzas Mom, other relatives, and I did have in the past!

My sister, Mom, and I have dined here a couple of times.  Great lunch buffet and good service.  Good naan and freshly-prepared dosas, although, as Mimi B. mentioned, the crepes aren't as crispy and golden as I've enjoyed at other restaurants .  Chai is good, but the desserts are even better!  Loved the carrot halwa.  Udipi is a region in India, as well as a style of cooking, that is known for its vegetarian specialties, so veggieheads, as well as carnivores, will love the vast menu options offered here.  Definitely a great lunch stop in the Queen City!

Each time I visit, I tell myself I'll come here more often, yet I've only been here three times since it's opened.  First two times I had the sweet potato pancakes with mascarpone-brown sugar pecan topping.  Mmm! .  The pancakes were partially-cooked the first time, but were tasty enough for me to order a second time, and I'm glad I did, as they were perfectly-executed.    I took my Mom with me on my third visit- she had an omelette with potatoes, feta (or was it blue-cheese?), and black beans, and I had the berry whole-grain French toast with creme-anglaise.  Oh. My. Goodness!  As I think back as to what I was tasting and how I felt throughout that experience, I see bursts of color... just like fireworks!  As you can tell by now, I have a sweet-tooth, but I also had a few bites of my Mom's omelette, and the savory flavors were just as appetizing as my sweet dish.  The owners have done away with the gift shop that was located in the middle of the restaurant, which is a shame as the food takes awhile to reach the table.  However, it's just as pleasurable to take a few minutes to visit the quaint restrooms to freshen up and arrive back to the table with some designing ideas for the home.    I am definitely looking forward to my next trip to Palatte!

10/28/11  Met friends here for cocktails to kick off celebrations for Michele M.'s birthday!  It was all our first time at Sanctuary Resort & Spa and its Jade Bar- many exclaimed how small the bar was- nothing at all as what they pictured it would be after checking out the resort's website.  I liked the atmosphere here, intimate and, at least at the beginning, very quiet, allowing easy conversations w/out our shouting at one another.  (This changed when day turned to night.)  Whatever indoor audio atmosphere Jade Bar lost as day at night, the aural pool display outside made up!  I had a mojito, or some flavored variety of it, I believe.  It was just OK.  I don't think I even finished half of it.  I really, really enjoyed the Charred lime and togarashi edamame!  I like edamame, don't get me wrong, but I was never moved to order them from any venue before, bec. it's EDAMAME.  Salted soybeans.  Some places might add some black pepper to the mix.  No big whoop.  But oh, boy!  My opinion on this has changed with Jade Bar's charred edamame.  First thing I'll do when I return is order a bowl of these babies.  Second thing I'll do is NOT order the hummus!  No, I'm not a fan of the hummus here.    Y'know, it makes me wonder about what dining at Elements might be like. If the kitchen can whip out these magic beans, what other surprises may I uncover?  However, the misstep on the hummus gives me pause...

5/12/10  Came in to try some happy hour eats (Fibber Magee's offers 50% off all apps and flatbreads between 4p and 7p).  To begin my dining experience, I found the darkness in the pub to be overwhelming (a word I'd rather use in this context is "oppressing," but I'm trying to lighten up!).  I wouldn't have minded so much (as I could've sat closer to the door left ajar, which allowed light to come in), but then the music blaring out of the speakers overhead was just too much!  To compound the situation, the song selections were either U2 (which I liked) or jarring Irish punk rock (which I don't), most of which were of the latter.  :(  Perhaps I should've walked away after making these observations, but I've had FM bookmarked for at least six years now, and I wanted to get it over with.  After many inquiries about food preparation, the bread used (which company?  specific ingredients used?), etc., I decided I'd go w/ the crabcakes and the braised rib sliders.  The crabcakes (topped w/ roasted red peppers and garnished w/ wasabi and mustard mayo, the latter I opted out) also came w/ a side mixed greens salad and a citrus vinaigrette. While this dish wasn't the best-looking of all the dishes I had that afternoon- don't let the pic of the bread pudding fool you, it was the best-tasting, but this isn't saying much.  I didn't care for the watered-down flavor of the citrus vinaigrette, and frankly, the crabcakes had enough flavor, so the lack of dressing wasn't a big deal.  I don't know if I'd order them again, though...  What was a big let-down was the braised shortrib sliders' dish.  Now these sliders looked fantastic, but the shortrib pieces were so sinewy and/or fatty, that, as much as I tried, I couldn't chew through any!  I really wanted to like these, bec. of those gorgeous-looking fried onion strings that sat on top of each slider.  Thankfully, my server offered to swap them for something else, and it was w/ a little sadness that I said goodbye to those onion strings :'(  Lately, mussels haven't appealed to me, so my server's suggestion to try FM's wasn't giving me much hope.   Surprisingly, these mussels tasted OK, and the price is right (for happy hour), and if I weren't already not disappointed in the darkness of the pub; the loudness of the music's volume; and the sub-par quality of the shortribs, I may have enjoyed them more.  With the hope of finding something good to write about, I ordered the bread pudding.  (At this point, I should've just given up.)  The bread pudding dish, which you'd think, looking at the pics I took, would taste good,  was a disaster!  It was dark in the pub, yes, but the dish looked like they just placed slices of bread down, showered them w/ dried cranberries, and poured some white chocolate sauce.  Something was amiss- was it even baked?  How was it prepared?  There wasn't enough cream sauce to cover most of the bread.  I was told that the bread was indeed soaked in the cream, and then baked, but this bread pudding had to be the worst I've ever tried.  The pics looked great, but don't be fooled...    The server was friendly, and most of the stars reflect her attempts to appease me, but I didn't enjoy my experience there, and would never recommend this place to anyone.

02/05/10  Met three friends for lunch- a first-time visit for all of us.  Was pleasantly surprised to find that this restaurant had such a nice atmosphere-- pretty tapestries adorned the walls, and the windows had nice wooden embellishments.  (I was expecting another Haji-Baba-type venue bec. of the location.)  Our server, who struck me as either the manager or the owner, was warm and friendly, and even chimed in when he overheard us discussing a documentary on the food industry (Food, Inc.); I'm used to a curt greeting, head down, followed by a pen landing on an order pad.  On to the food.  Kat and Kevin, both vegetarians, ordered a falafel pita and a sanbusek lunch platter.  Violeta H. and I ordered the chicken tikka platter (hers w/ rice and mine w/ salad).  All of the dishes looked wonderful!  The falafel pieces looked so delicious, I almost wished I'd ordered that instead until I saw the marvelous-looking plate of sanbusek that landed in front of Kevin, which made me wish I'd ordered THAT instead!  (I usually stay away from fried foods, especially at Middle eastern venues since many use corn oil for frying.)  They both found the dishes quite tasty and "easy on the stomachs," with only the complaint of the sanbusek's small portion size.  The chicken tikka filets looked moist, slightly charred at the edges, and had a beautiful amber-orange hue from the marinade used.  We all very much enjoyed the hummus!  One of the best I've tried in the valley (although Phoenix's Persian Garden Cafe and Chandler's Pita Jungle still top all the venues I've tried)!  I actually found the tikka to be a bit dry, yet still very tasty.  The salad was also delightfully crisp, the lettuce sweet, and the dressing light and zesty (really liked the cumin on top).  Since none of them wanted to have dessert (we were all quite full and satisfied), I bought some walnut baklava to-go.  These pieces were ambrosial!  They were just the way I like them- phyllo still crispy, yet had just enough honey syrup to coat your tastebuds AND your fingers.  These were literally finger-lickin' good!  I wasn't surprised that these were made with a butter and margarine blend (I asked), which means I won't be ordering them again, but if this fact doesn't bother you, then by all means, you HAVE to try the baklava!

Last visited here a year or so ago.  Mom and I were here once before for both of our cars a couple of years ago and liked our experiences then, so I came back.  This time it was an oil leak, but they could not find the leak after two attempts.  How much did their "investigations" cost me?  More than $600!!  And my car STILL leaked!  I called a relative,  who's knowledgeable in cars and lives out-of-state, and told him of my troubles here, and after speaking w/ the manager on the phone he was able to get him to give my money back.  I have not gone back to have my car serviced here, and I could never recommend anyone, not even those that I do not like, to come here.  (Honestly, I could never deceive anyone into doing something I know they'll regret just bec. I don't like them!)  I did not appreciate the condescending way he spoke to me, or to my relative, either.  Hold onto your money and spend it wisely somewhere else!

Loved the complimentary green chile tamale appetizer here!  I also adored the chicken enchilada with green chile cream sauce!!  I especially appreciated the fact that I was able to order this dish NOT fried.  Some venues refuse to alter their menu selections.  Understandable, since many chains strive to stay within national standards, but it's great to find establishments that gladly cater to their customers' wishes!  Even though our first, and only, visit was 3 or 4 years ago, I vividly recall it was a beautiful night, so Mom and I opted to dine in the patio.  It started to get chilly, but we did not want to move inside for the solo acoustic guitarist was delightful playing his Santana covers.  Thank goodness I always keep an extra jacket/sweater in the car for emergencies!  Thank you Jalapeno for a memorable night!

I've been a fan of Thai Hut back in the days when it was situated on Baseline and Alma School Rd.  The owners, Bee and George, are from CA and are so warm and friendly.  Their children run the cash registers.  I've noticed that they've been so busy to say hi to me on my last few visits.  Indeed, I'm told that the adult children haven't been able to go back to university since TH moved to the downtown Phoenix location.  I did notice new faces working the front of the house.  They don't seem very friendly.  The owners have lamented on how busy they are, that by the end of the day, they cannot wait to close, which may account for all of the negative reviews of late.    Solid menus.  Missed being able to order other entrees besides lunch specials- new location has kept the kitchen humming that it was decided that the menu be trimmed down to a short list to keep the traffic flowing.    It's been months since my last visit.  I hope to have an update soon!

It's been many months since I last saw Bee & George at Thai Hut, so I decided to stop by and order one of the lunch specials- Pad Thai with tofu, minus the bean sprouts ($7.95).  Lunch specials come with a veggie eggroll and a bowl of veggie soup.  Looks like they've eliminated rice noodles from their filling.  I'm happy to report  there aren't any sprouts in the mix, either!  Soup was sweet, with a lot of veggies (spring onions, shredded cabbage and carrots, and I'm pretty sure there's celery, too, although I couldn't easily spot them).  Of course, I don't have to say how delicious the Pad Thai was.  This is the first time I tried it w/ stifr-fried tofu, instead of the default chicken (lunch specials all come with chicken; no fee for tofu sub, although beef and seafood all come with an extra $2 fee).  For dessert, I had an exquisite scoop of coconut ice cream made in-house!  One scoop is ample enough for two people to enjoy, but since I was dining solo, I was forced to eat it all myself :D  I could definitely taste salt, but I thought it was very complementary.  A must-try!  Nice to see that B&G have added some paintings depicting everday Thai/Asian life on the main dining room walls- it's about time!  Oh, and even though kitchen staff was short and very busy with lunch traffic, Bee was gracious enough to come out and greet me with a warm hug and a hello.  I will be coming back soon for dinner!

9/22/10  Finally ventured away from green curry today and tried two new (to me!) dishes: #57 Egg Noodle Soup BBQ Pork ($9.95) and #36 Stir-fry Eggplant ($9.95).  Since I was planning on taking most of the noodle soup home, I didn't want the noodles to thicken up from the broth, so I asked for the soup entree to be "dry."  When the dish arrived w/ a little broth, I initially was disappointed.  That is, until I tried the broth!  What was I thinking?  The broth tasted so good!  I also loved the bbq pork w/ the egg noodles.  I loved the combo so much, I finished the entire serving!  I'm definitely going to order this one the next time I visit!  :)  The stir-fried eggplant entree was also very tasty.  My only complaint is that it was very greasy.  OK, I did have a second complaint-- why can't I order this dish w/ an accompaniment of egg noodles instead of rice?  I CAN'T eat rice!  I even told them to charge me for it, in case it was a question of substitution (which some places frown upon), but I wasn't given that option, either :(  Oh well... I decided I'd sulk a bit and then reward myself w/ some coconut ice cream.  While their ice cream still tasted good, my stomach can't take it anymore... Wonder if they've changed the recipe?  Today wasn't the first time I couldn't keep it down.  Too greasy, I think.

05/08/10  Friend and I had a fantastic dinner here- my first time back since attending a Yelp event held at Firesky Resort months ago.  We chose to dine outside as it was a nice afternoon.  (Also, the restaurant just opened for dinner, so no one was dining indoors, yet.)  We were hungry, so by the time our server arrived for our drink orders (just water, since we had some wine at the bar and reception areas) we also placed our entree requests- the wild salmon sounded divine, so we both wanted it (she w/ fingerling potatoes and I subbing asparagus).  When it became apparent that we weren't going to get bread unless we asked for it (we waited at least ten minutes-- we were there early... we were hungry!), we asked if complimentary bread was available.  (It was, and with delicious marinated olives, too!)  Words cannot do these beautiful entrees justice!  As you can see from the photos, the salmon I had was so juicy.  The textures were exquisite-- starting at the perfectly-crisped skin, nicely seasoned; then immediately underneath it, the seared, buttered flesh; through the flaky layers, until you reach the tender medium-rare center...  There, there- I'm getting waves of goosebumps up and down my arms and neck just recalling those moments!  And the accompanying vegetables were equally splendid!  Crunchy, yet dainty asparagus spears flanked by olives, grape tomatoes, artichoke hearts, and fennel!  Mmm... I think it's time to check out restaurant.com for a gift certificate for another meal here soon :)    Didn't know acquaintance James Siao is Taggia's "chef de cuisine"- what a nice surprise!  He was so sweet to offer my friend and me a complimentary dessert to share.  All the desserts on the menu that night sounded great, but it was no contest-- we had to check out the tiramisu!  Taggia serves up a terrific version-- a marvel to look at, and so many layers to tantalize the tastebuds... So cool and creamy, and the cocoa used was of very high quality.  This dessert was packed w/ so much flavor, yet it was very light-tasting (and very light in the tummy, too!).  This tiramisu lived up to its name- a perfect pick-me-up!  Can't wait to go back!

Took my cousin and myself here to enjoy some sweets before enjoying some art at tonight's First Friday Artwalk.  I loved, loved, LOVED the rosemary shortbread.  Wished I had bought more than just one square.  We also raved over the brownie chunk cookie.    I'll definitely be stopping by here on my next artwalk!

Whenever I have a craving for Mediterranean food, I come here.  Due to food allergies, I am not able to enjoy hummus anymore so going to other places that offer hummus can be bittersweet; However, all is forgotten when I enter Kabab Palace.  The lunch buffet offers so many flavorful dishes, such as banjan, veggie kourma challow, and sabzi.  My faves are the excellent kaddo and qabelee!  My only caveat is the lunch buffet price- $11 before drinks and tax!  However, the spread is varied and delicious, and the temptation to throw caution to the wind and partake in hummus (allergy) is non-existent.  It's easy to overeat- consider yourself warned!

I love happy hour here!  Just like Alton Brown, I'm only here for the food :)  On my second visit for happy hour, I had the mashed potato spring rolls with cheese and bacon, the excellent tri-tip sandwiches made with whole wheat bread, and chicken summer rolls (with rice noodles, asparagus, bell peppers, and a spicy peanut sauce).  All were SUPERB.  I then finished with the beignets with three equally-successful sauces: raspberry, Whiskey creme-anglaise, and dark chocolate ganache.  I'm a definite fan.  Chubbier, but happy!

Took Mom and myself to have dinner here after work on Sunday (4/12).  Nice space.  We were given above-average service when we were seated at the robata counter.  (Actually, it's the level of service I expected given the atmosphere of the restaurant.  Anything less would have been suspect.)  When we had to move to the bar in order to take advantage of reverse happy hour, the service level dropped considerably- more on that later.  Since we had arrived around 8:30p, we studied the menus to see what we could try off of the regular sushi options for dinner (the soft-shelled crab) and happily found out that Roka Akor recently started offering, "on a smaller scale," a few robata apps only to be served on Sundays.  I thought what a nice way to be introduced to the robata menu.  I asked the usual questions regarding allergy concerns and asked how certain items were prepared.  I even handed the bartender , Colin, a list of allergens to hand to the chefs.  (Evidently this list was only going to be looked at once, since many of our dishes had to be corrected after delivery.)  Off of the robata apps menu, I ordered the shrimps ($5) for Mom and the zucchini ($1.50) and the black cod ($5) for us to share.  Off of the regular sushi menu, I ordered the soft-shelled crab roll ($9 for 5 pcs.) for Mom.  The timing of delivery of these items was haphazard.  It took at least 10 minutes before the plate containing two medium-sized shrimp to arrive.  To charge $6 for two grilled shrimp is just ridiculous!  It did smell wonderful and looked appetizing, but Mom wasn't wowed by them- certainly not at $3 per shrimp!  The soft-shelled crab arrived about 5 minutes after the shrimp did and looked great.  Mom found the rice good enough, but she still wasn't feeling any love.  The plate of zucchini arrived roughly about 5 minutes after the crab roll (that's 20 minutes after I ordered!) and held 5 pcs. of seasoned zucchini (salt, pepper, and soy) and a dollop of mustard sauce at one corner of the plate.  Mom liked the one piece she tried, but as much as I tried to get her to try the mustard, she didn't, so I can't report on that aspect.  So here we were, 5 minutes before happy hour was to commence, and all I had to nibble on were the zucchini pieces... Black cod was nowhere to be found.  Correction, Colin the bartender said he spied it at the robata counter, but did not make a move to retrieve it.  I asked Colin if I could give him my happy hour menu selections (all cost $5 each) so that he may have them ready for entry at 9p?  He took my order of Crispy squid and a salmon roll.  I also ordered two Roka Akor burgers, one without the housemade bun, and instead asked for an extra slice of heirloom tomato as a sub.  Would you believe that the crispy squid (again, only for Mom to enjoy bec. the batter contained *!) and the salmon roll (which arrived with **, which I wrote down on the list as two of my allergens- apparently the chefs did not remember, nor did Colin recall to alert the chefs) arrived before the black cod app?  Anyway, the salmon roll was left for my Mom to enjoy while the chef prepared another, allergen-free, for me.  Before I go on, let me say that Mom LOVED the calamari!!  This was the first dish that wowed her, and she exclaimed that this version of calamari is the best she's EVER tasted and even begged for me to forget about my allergy and try them- they were that good!  But I stood my ground.  I found the salmon to be very fresh-tasting and mild-flavored.  The pea-sized miso-mayo garnish that sat atop each piece was so mild, the roll could have been served without these embellishments and no one would know the difference.  I'd say that the black cod (3 pcs.) arrived at least 45 minutes since the time of order.  At least.  Aren't robata items, esp. seafood, supposed to be quick to cook?  I will say that the cod tasted superb, and I'd order them again.  Well, maybe.  $5 for three small pieces is too much, I think.  Last, but not least, to arrive were the beef burgers, one-at-a-time.  Funny, the first burger, which arrived without avocado, but with a bun, so that was quickly returned.  My Mom's burger came, with everything on it, but she didnt' try hers until mine arrived- she was still working on the calamari and the salmon roll.  I liked the beef patty, cooked perfectly to medium rare, although I wished there was more flavor.  Mom's burger looked amazing.  Too bad the lighting at the bar was very minimal (one oil lamp for the both of us until Colin saw me taking photos and lit up another and placed it in front of me, but the fire died down soon after).  I hope to return again to see if the service improves (better memory recall and timing of delivery).  I found the ambivalence showed by Colin of the (greater than 30%) tip I'd given him off-putting.  Factored in the price of the comped salmon roll, PLUS tipped based on the burgers original price of $4 each, too.  Hmm... maybe not too soon a return.

7/27/11  Took Mom for our first lunch here, and she LOVED it!  I really should take her back for lunch again (she won't let me treat her to dinner here, as the ticket could get pricey very fast!).  From our starters of miso soup http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=QBQnXq0OfJRfDbim4bq8Nw#QBQnXq0OfJRfDbim4bq8Nw and salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=vs7J2Sxqm5CKQD4t737K0w#vs7J2Sxqm5CKQD4t737K0w, to our main courses of sashimi http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=crw2LPM69lGjbf2aR6nfoQ#crw2LPM69lGjbf2aR6nfoQ and robata pork http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=oqQ7SHbOv8iTzf3rnS6XYg#oqQ7SHbOv8iTzf3rnS6XYg, she was in heaven!  Everything was perfect-- from the dressing of the salad, to the meat temperature of the pork (fully cooked, no redness anywhere, yet still tender and very juicy).  I'd say the only thing that didn't impress her was the miso.  I thought it was OK, although not enough soy cubes, but I wasn't too worried about it, since I was looking forward to our entrees.  So glad I spotted the photos in my iPhoto folders... Now I know where to take Mom for our next lunch date!  :)  p.s.  Here's another shot of the robata pork tenderloin-- just look at that gorgeous caramelization!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=HrhOl_vuURZc31AE4wdbcA#HrhOl_vuURZc31AE4wdbcA

Love this location!  Used to eat at the grill every week!  I'd get the organic burgers with crispy waffle fries, and I'd swap out their buns (both whole wheat and onion varieties tasted great!) for Ezekiel sprouted grain.  If you feel like splurging, try their huge beer-battered onion rings or their fried zucchini!  I couldn't try the Asian-food counter since everything's laced with corn products and other allergens.  The seafood counter will cook your items for you using whatever spices you'd like to sample before you buy (I love the Roasted meat and Jerk seasonings).    The hot and cold buffet counters used to offer a more-varied selection when they first opened last year.  Recent visits have revealed less-scintillating offerings.  Even the salad bars do not look appealing.    Still, a much better location compared to the one on Rural and Baseline.

Love the daily specials at The Smokehouse Grill!  I had the cheeseburger with cheddar and a side of waffle fries ($4.99 plus tax).  I've had quite a few perfectly-shaped burger patties there in the past, and it's probably just the way the patty was shaped this time around, but it was a little disappointing to see more bread than meat.  However, there was a lot of meat in this dish, so I couldn't complain.  Medium rare is perfect.     I chose to dine at the wine bar this time around, and I must say I do not like its austere surroundings.  Perhaps I shouldn't sit so close to bottles of wine and try the tables closer to the bar.  I do appreciate that a server at the Smokehouse will take platters of food and walk them to the wine bar should you choose to dine there, but I prefer dining at the Smokehouse grill counter- it's warmer and more inviting there, reminiscent of a lux pub.

9/10/09  The Smokehouse Grill was featuring a special on a few of their popular burgers- $4.99 buys you a burger and a side, from a selection of four or five burgers.  I've never tried their "gorgonzola burger," so I chose that with a side of waffle fries.  (If you haven't tried WF' waffle fries and you're a waffle-fry kind-of-guy/gal, then you're missing out!)  With my order on the grill, I headed to the Wine and Tapas bar to sample a few wines.  After choosing a bottle to take home (Kung Fu Girl Riesling $14.99), I made a quick stop to try a few new cheeses at the cheese counter (I really do love this WF location!!) before ending up at the Grill to savor my delectable gorgonzola burger.  And delectable it was!  First, I always choose the caramelized onion-studded bun, which is usually slightly-toasted on the grill.  The lettuce leaves and slices of tomatoes always are crisp, look appetizing, and taste fresh.  And the gorgonzola?  Just perfect little mounds on top with the bottom layer cajoling me to hurry up and savor the first bite as it begins to melt against the perfectly-cooked organic and grass-fed burger patty!  I had eaten about half of this delightful (not) little gem when I noticed a few pieces of what looked to me like 'shrooms.  As some of you may know by now, 'shrooms and I do not get along, even though I love them dearly.  It was then that I knew why I hadn't tried their "gorgonzola burger."  This selection is usually denoted as a g & m burger, but for convenience's sake, someone omitted that fact on the daily special board.  You can now thank me that in the future, the staff at the grill will no longer take shortcuts when listing down their daily specials.  I must commend the staff on how they chose to handle this error.  Not only did they offer to replace the burger I was currently eating (from which I continued to pick out those offending pieces that I could detect), with a new platter, minus the 'shrooms (yep, more waffle fries too!), but I was also refunded the purchase price.  This second measure I thought was very generous of them- one corrective measure was sufficient, and yet Whole Foods offered me both!  Whole Foods' consistently fantastic customer service is what makes me continue to drive all the way to Laveen to shop there, as well as choose it as a gourmet destination, as well!  Thank you Whole Foods for your excellent customer service policies, which you not only advertise, but implement with no guilt imposition whatsoever!  I feel a need to put forth shout-outs to Toni and Angela (who I first met at the Grill a few years ago), to Jim who usually helps me out at the Wine bar, to those lovely chocolate counter clerks that let you sample gelatos and choccies before you buy (or not!), and a general thank you to all the friendly staff that help to make my experiences at WF pleasant everytime!

03/05/10  On my way to Whole Foods, I called to find out what the daily specials were.  The rep on the phone started reading off the specials and she had me at crab-stuffed salmon.  I sometimes order my selection/s on the phone prior to arrival, but I had shopping to do, so I decided to wait.  (Yes, you read correctly- you can place your orders on the phone!)  The salmon special ($6.99 and came w/ a side) was prepared w/ wild-caught salmon and a mayo-based crab stuffing.  While the platter looked great (beautiful crust!), the crab stuffing wasn't flavorful enough; Indeed, I found it too simple and reminded me of dips (or pats of butter) that have been sitting too long in the fridge :(  The salmon was also a little overcooked and too dry.  But waffle fries usually save a dish for me, so this venture wasn't a total loss.  If this dish could be prepared to be more tender and moist, I'd order it again.    Four stars bec. I really do love this Whole Foods location, but for this meal, just two-stars :(

03/19/10  Awesome $6.99 seared wild ahi tuna salad special today!  Some pieces were slightly overcooked, while others had beautiful rare centers, and the presentation could've been better, but the flavors were what mattered!  Ample salad portions, and the balsamic vinaigrette was delightful.  A couple of squeezes of the lemon wedge, and everything was perfect :)  I did request that they grill the accompanying slice of bread-- a bit too toasted, but I worked w/ it.  I've since gone back for two more of these specials, and I'm just happy to be able to enjoy wild-caught fish once in awhile.  (Otherwise, I bypass seafood.)  Thanks, Smokehouse Grill!

05/05/10  Another great update from the Smokehouse Grill-- the Steak and cheese sandwich (comes w/ your choice of side), one of a few on the daily specials' board.  The waffle fries alone would make any meal worth the daily special price, but my pick today was just shoe-dropping good!!  The meat was cooked just right- superbly seasoned and had great texture.  I love onions best when they're caramelized, and these had a nice bite to it and added just enough sweetness to counteract the saltiness of the cheese.  Oh, but don't forget the bread!  These had a great crusty exterior and, yet, soft inside... Yum!  I want another, please!

7/17/10  Decided I'd try a customized sandwich at the sandwich bar.  For the price of a comparable roasted vegetable pesto panini ($6.99 plus tax), I chose focaccia bread, red bell peppers, asparagus, yellow squash, caramelized onions, hummus, kalamata olive tapenade, brie, and roasted garlic.  (Ask them nicely to get the garlic from the pizzeria next door; They usually will oblige, as most of the WF employees I've encountered love their jobs and are fantastic that way!)  Let me tell you, EVERY bite was utter bliss!  Oh, yeah!  What makes this sandwich amazing?  No, not the brie, for I've omitted this from succeeding orders.  It's not the caramelized onions.  No, it's the hummus!  And the tapenade!  Try it!  If focaccia isn't your thing, try the ciabatta rolls.  Oh, and if you're unfortunate enough to visit after they've turned off the hot press, the soft whole wheat rolls are good to use, and good for you, too!

I thought I'd update my reviews here by mentioning that there will be an ice cream social event on Saturday, July 27th, from 2p to 5p, or so an e-newsletter informed me this morning!  I clicked on the Facebook link https://www.facebook.com/wholefoodsto get more information, which led me to a WF website link that stated "all Whole Foods" will be participating.  I wish I could go, because not only will WF have their own brand of ice cream on-hand, but one of my favorite organic brands, Three Twins, is going to be featured, and both email and website state that for every Three Twins purchase made, one dollar will be donated to the Non-GMO Project!  To find out more this organization, please visit http://nongmoproject.com.  The website mentioned all WF stores are participating, but that "some stores might have sweet concoctions up their sleeve like sundaes, shakes, floats and malts and many are planning fun events for kids and adults alike..."    Wish I could attend the event myself, but I'll be at work, so for those of you planning to attend, just have an extra tablespoon of ice cream for me!  :)  Read more about the event here http://wholefoodsmarket.com/blog/youre-cordially-invited-ice-cream-social-july-27?sf15241907=1

08/18 and 08/19  Came to check out Benihana's happy hour and sat at the bar.  One bartender was more eager than the other to answer my questions regarding my food issues, but both were gracious and friendly.  I wondered if they split the tips evenly?  Tried a few plates...  Some were 50% off, and some were slightly reduced.  The menu pricing was a little confusing, and I hope that this is corrected in the near future.  The seaweed salad was OK.  Don't know if I would pay the full price of $3.75, though.  (And for 50%, or was it $3?, I don't think it was worth that, either.)  The gyoza was also just OK- a bit on the bland side and a bit lacking on the mouth-feel aspect.  The asparagus tempura plate was a nice surprise; However, the greasiness got to me, and in the end, I was stripping the batter off of the spears more due to necessity, and not w/ the sadness I normally would be feeling from having to trim off delightful cruchiness, bec. otherwise I couldn't enjoy the meal knowing I'd ingested all of that excess oil!  The tuna sashimi was very good and substantial, compared to all of the "light" apps that I tasted before it.  The spicy yellowtail was also very nice, although the jalapenos were a bit too much, so I just scooped them off to the side.  Really liked the acidic component of this dish!  With all the HH reductions, I wasn't thrilled w/ this meal, but at least I know which to revisit and which to pass next time.  Lunch was also a bit disappointing.  Both lunch boat and duet came w/ many components, but Mom and I only truly enjoyed the salad, the chicken (it was good, although I couldn't eat much of it), the salmon sashimi, and the runaway hit, beef julienne (both off of the boat).  Since these came, for the most part, in two-bite portions, we didn't feel like we received our money's worth.    Looking back, I know we won't be returning any time soon.

This half-marathon event was my first, and I had a blast!  I was approached by a coworker who asked if I would like to join the event.  Since the company was offering to pay the admission fee, I accepted the challenge.    I had planned only to walk all the way, since I had developed plantar fasciitis on my left foot from all those years of running ten miles everyday.  However, it being my first marathon event and with so many eager attendees, I began the event with a running start.  Funnily enough, I was running/walking four to six miles every other day up until about sept. or oct. 2007.  From then on, I was only doing cardio, strength, and flexibility DVD exercises, so I really did not train for this event; Yet, I am proud to have finished the run/walk, and with a good time (2:28), as well!  I'd like to thank a few nameless (and faceless)  people, young and elderly, who I kept pace with.  It was so inspiring to see so many in their 60s and beyond keeping pace (and humbling, too, to have many more pass me by!).  Many thanks to the cheering people, squads and individuals alike, who showed up with their smiles and high spirits, and also I tip my hat to the volunteers who handed out nourishments along the way!  I skipped on pre-registering for next year thinking that my employer would do the event again, and this time doing it right by having a tent set up for the aftermath celebration, but alas, my employer elected not to sponsor a second time on account of so many no-show employees which cost the company so much money.  Tsk, tsk.  Perhaps those of us who wanted to run next year's event will be able to talk our employer into supporting us in 2010!  If you're thinking of signing up, think no more and just do it!  It'll be an event you'll remember for the rest of your life.

Had lunch here with Mom a few months ago- calamari app and a pie.  Calamari was alright, nothing to rave about, and certainly not something I'd order again.  Plus, the batter contained cornmeal (corn allergy), and I'm not a fan of anything that contains cheap ingredients, esp. those that do great harm to people's health!  The pie wasn't memorable at all- I cannot even remember which one we had- it was that mediocre.  The first pie was charred all over, why it was allowed to leave the kitchen and served on a table, we'll never know.  I do give management some credit since they quickly replaced it with a better-looking, yet non-scintillating pie that had more dough than toppings.  Strike three: the noise level was ridiculously high, and the restaurant was only at 50% capacity.  You won't find me dining here on a weekend night based on the terrible acoustics alone.  No, you won't see me spending my money here again.

8/06 First visit.  Happy hour.  Two rolls- A Philadelphia and a spicy salmon roll, deep-fried, with roe on top.  Most sushi spots gladly substitute an ingredient if the regular order contains allergens I can't have without an upcharge.  Not Kabuki.  (I've had owners, chefs, and cooks tell me themselves that if a recipe is easily amenable, they'll gladly do the substitutions, w/ no offense taken.  This Kabuki chef isn't one of them.)  So food photos will reflect these recipe omissions.  Ordered a glass of house pinot grigio, which had a big black speck floating in it, but this was quickly remedied.    So few HH apps and drinks to choose from.  Servers were friendly enough, but sushi chef was VISIBLY annoyed (full face-frontal) when I had to return a dish as it contained an allergen I requested not to be used.  I could understand the offense if I had forgotten to include the info, or if I had multiple orders that made it hard for him to keep track, but a mistake on the second of two dishes, and with a list of allergens on a note right under your nose as a reminder??    Atmosphere is nothing to right home about.  I did like the lone red mosaic tile in the women's restroom.  Loved the contrast against the all-black theme.

Had dinner here with a dining group a few weeks back.  Had the green curry with chicken and it is one of the BEST green curries I've ever tasted!!  I cannot wait to return here and try the other dishes.    The parking situation leaves a lot to be desired, however.  I'm not much of a fan of metered parking...

Impressive dinner tonight!  However, it was a packed house, and it took over an hour for my Panang Curry to arrive.  While I was a part of a large group of about 14, our particular group had 6 people.  One tablemate's entree (Ginger veggie stir-fry?) arrived at least 20 minutes before the second tablemate saw hers (Yellow Curry).  It was at least another ten minutes before the third tablemate saw his, and so on...  I was able to sample my neighbors' dishes of Spicy Catfish (battered and fried catfish topped w/ bell peppers, basil, and spicy red curry sauce) and Swimming Rama w/ pork (topped w/ peanut sauce over steamed veggies).  All three were AMAZING!  I'll definitely order the Rama and the catfish next time!!!  Didi, our server, moved quickly, was efficient, and attentive, and was even helpful in suggesting alternate selections to those who had never had Thai food before.  She even warned tablemate Ericka, who'd only recently discovered peanut butter as an entree ingredient, that she'd either love or hate the Rama.  We were thankful that she rolled the dice and ordered it, anyway.  I hope that the kitchen crew can work out the kinks as far as pacing goes-I hope that by next visit I can up the review back to five stars!!  Ooh, do try the coconut ice cream w/ embedded grated coconut!  Not as good as Yupha's homemade coconut ice cream, but still  quite delightful :)

9/04 I like!  Not all diners can take me back to my first months living in CA.  Stepping into this Black Bear Diner, I felt like I had stepped into my uncle's Buckhorn motel and restaurant (sold a long time ago), thanks to the comforting aromas of coffee and breakfast cooking on the griddle, and the hustle-bustle of a busy diner! Our server was friendly, prompt, and efficient.  No complaints there.  Still no complaints when we received our orders of the daily special of NY steak and eggs (which came with hash browns and choice of bread: muffin, toast, pancake http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-bear-diner-goodyear?select=q7dK8yU76GIyLxt6KVjrHQ#q7dK8yU76GIyLxt6KVjrHQ , or biscuit) and a plate of biscuits and gravy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-bear-diner-goodyear?select=EpBzkp0dH2QNe4m-F7F4dQ#EpBzkp0dH2QNe4m-F7F4dQ  Loved that she asked us how we wanted the steak cooked- medium rare to medium, please. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-bear-diner-goodyear?select=30v8SVaQU2f7AcTsPIRd2w#30v8SVaQU2f7AcTsPIRd2w  Oh, and she was thoughtful enough to split our entree when all we had asked was to have an extra plate. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-bear-diner-goodyear?select=RCVOGduEtBFY2S63er9qlA#RCVOGduEtBFY2S63er9qlA  She even remembered that I didn't want to have any of the eggs... cool. Everything was delicious!  The color/temperature of the steak was perfect!  I did ask for the hash browns be cooked extra crispy, and it wasn't, but no big deal, since we had the lovely biscuits and gravy to contend with, too.  (I suggest you get your fill of the B&G when fresh, 'cause they're not good eats hours later, most notably the gravy... ugh.) Glad to find another breakfast eatery to take my Mom to!

What a quaint place!  However, I thank the Lord that I came across Tori B. in front of Thai Basil after my walking past Cartel (which is tucked away from street view) about two or three times.  We've never met, and it was so cool that I had asked the right random person and get to meet a fellow yelper, too!  The atmosphere made me think I was in a hangar or a warehouse, as if I stepped onto a movie set where a drug-smuggling scene is about to unfurl.  Where are the crates filled to the brim with firearms?  Haha.  Pretty nifty play on word there.  I was tempted to start drinking coffee again- I've only given it up about four times now.  Decided against since I don't want to have to deal with withdrawal headaches, and I'm starting to get more sleep time again.  Instead, I had an 8 oz. cup of all-natural chai made with half-whole milk and half-non-fat milk, frothed.  Wow!  It's a good thing Cartel isn't close to where I live, or I'll be having chai more often.    Thanks to Gabi and Yelp for introducing me to this cool place!

Dropped by for "Drop-In Thursdays" weekly wine tasting and to try a few menu items. Sauvignon blanc was light and sweet, with very pronounced grapefruit notes. I liked Abundance Vineyards Abundantly Rich Red (Zinfandel and Carignane varietals)- fruity, not too sweet; This bottle sells retail at $14;, Fine's at $12.66- Thursday's special was $10... I should've bought two! I didn't like the cabernet much. (Honestly, I kept tasting paint thinner... not good eats, er, drinks.) Alright, I was now ready to order some food!  My companion and I decided we'd try the Sweet potato fries, Housemade duck confit bratwurst, Escargot, and Fine's wine burger (please see photos above). While I didn't think much of the fries and the accompanying sauces (balsamic is slightly tangy; tomato is salty; and vanilla bean is just... sweet) at the beginning of the meal, I grew to enjoy them at the end- it was fun to experiment with the sauces to find good combinations!  I'm sure the wine tastings and the $5 glass of Calina Reserva Carménère had something to do with this!  The bratwurst was a winner, but at $11 for such a small portion (about a 2.5" link), I'll wait till 1/2 off Mondays to enjoy this one again. (I'll have to ask the chef to swap something for the slaw, w/c had good-looking bacon or pancetta mixed in, along with allergens I don't want.)  I was hesitant to try the escargot, esp. after trying Tapino's a few days ago, but I'm glad my friend ordered it, anyway. It was perfection on a plate!  Buttery, but not greasy, and I adored the chunky bits of garlic there!  I had thought of asking for more bread, but sometimes it's better to be left wanting for more than to have too much.  Merrill, our bartender, said that many people have opined that Fine's wine burger was the best burger they've ever had. Perhaps!  It certainly vies with the goodness of Quiessence's Farm burger.  It was beautiful to look at (cooked to medium rare), and equally tasty, with the caramelized onions the scene-stealer in this dish!  My friend was tickled by the battered pickles! Indubitably, they begged to be tasted, but I stood my ground.  Can't wait for Mondays to roll around... Fine's Cellar undeniably deserves an early beg-off from work!

9/15  After ordering take-out from Goldman's Deli, I decided to stop at Crust to try their happy hour (50% off all apps and a few alcoholic beverages, with 50% off glasses of wine).  Even though I arrived 15 minutes before happy hour (4:30p start till 6:30p?), Mike, one of the owners/chefs told me I could order off the menu.  How nice of him!  A coworker testified that the filet mignon sliders were pretty good, so I chose the small plate (3 sliders), originally $11, and a glass of Riesling.  While I waited for the sliders to arrive, I devoured the deli sandwich from Goldman's (loved the textures and flavors, but not the price!).  The sliders arrived after about fifteen minutes- not too long for what was to be one of the best sliders I've tasted in recent memory!  Loved the crunchy exterior of the bread, as well as the color.  (I took some home to enjoy at a later date, and I'm happy to say they were just as great re-heated in the toaster oven!)  The filet mignon strips were very tender and juicy, and the accompanying horseradish cream sauce was splendid!  Not a drop of it was left on my plate, this I can assure you  :)  Oh, and what about the au jus?  I only tasted saltwater with a little bit of meat essence.  Pass.  The sliders and cream sauce were flavorful enough to make the au jus unnecessary.  You'd think that half a deli sandwich and three steak sliders would've been enough, but rich entrees (and the cream sauce was very creamy and rich) usually make me crave for something sweet, so I went ahead and placed an order of the nutella pizza (same Rustica crust, with nutella, sliced strawberries and banana, and dollops of vanilla bean ice cream), minus the banana.  Please note that there is at least a fifteen-minute wait for this OUTSTANDING hazelnut and chocolate pizza.  Oh my...  I'd come back just to order it again and ravage it all by myself =)

10/12  Happy 2nd anniversary, Crust!  To celebrate Crust's 2nd Ann'y, the entire menu, minus hard liquor, was going for 50% off today!  I decided I'd order my fave Rustica bianca, as well as two other selections I've wanted to try: the Crusted Mac 'n Cheese and the Pasta alla Forno.  The mac 'n cheese is too-die-for!  Love that crust topping and toasted cheeses- count 'em, there's five: fontina, velveeta, romano-pecorino, parmesan, and cheddar?  I'll have to double-check sometime soon ;)  The Pasta alla Forno is also very tasty; the peas lend the dish a sweetness that I like.  Oh, but the mac 'n cheese...    For dessert, I'd ordered the Nutella pizza, but with everything included (I was going to try eating bananas again).  I forgot to stipulate "no powdered sugar," so after the 15-minute wait, I was presented this pretty dessert pie, but I couldn't enjoy it due to all the powder.  It was promptly removed, but I'd have to wait another 40 minutes for a new batch (the resto was packed).  I must've had a pretty sad face on while waiting for my ticket, bec. Mike came out and offered me a complimentary mini-cannoli.  I was still pretty sad about missing out on all of that Nutella goodness, but after a couple of cannoli bites, I was once again my happy self :D    BTW, the leftovers warm up well!

10/27  OK, I've decreed that Crust is my favorite pizza and wine restaurant!  (That is, until a few friends prove to me otherwise that there are better NY-style/thin-crust pizza joints in the valley.)  Not only does Crust offer up super-crispy and flavorful Rustica pizzas ("hand-stretched"), but their 20" thin-crust round pies (I've tried the Little Nicky- white pie w/ fresh spinach and tomatoes) and pasta dishes (crusted mac 'n cheese is delicious both fresh and re-heated) are good, too!  I am IN LOVE w/ Crust's filet mignon sliders w/ horseradish cream sauce.  This time the au jus reduction was SUBLIME, and oh so garlicky!  I was told that the "regular" chef was working that day.  To the unnamed chef, I salute you!  :)  The table bread, which you will have to specially request or you won't get any, was great w/ either butter or dunked into the au jus.  MMmm!  As if the steak sliders and the decadent cream sauce ($4.50 for 3 pcs, HH menu) weren't enough- I've got to find out where I can get my hands on those buns these sliders are served on!- I went ahead and ordered a pot of brownie sundae ($9.50).  This was my first time ordering the brownie sundae and had not realized it came served in a mini-caulderon-style pot.  Should you decide to order this sweet, make sure you have at least two other tablemates w/ you to share the wealth!  The walnut brownie came w/ sliced bananas, fudge sauce, and a scoop of ice cream and then topped w/ homemade whip cream and a maraschino cherry!  If you're a sundae fan, you'll love this delectable sweet pot!  Addendum 10/30: So why not 5 stars?  The atmosphere here isn't as inviting as it could be.  I never minded much about this quality until I spent happy hour with three friends at Cork last night.  (What a beautiful and cozy space Cork has!  Cork review coming soon!)  I'm assuming it's intentional- this being a pizza and wine cafe, the owners want quick turnovers.  Am I right?  Hmm...

8/28, 9/11, 10/1, and 10/12  Crust is still in my regular rotation, no surprise to some of you, I know... After a few updates, I usually won't add another review unless I try something worth yelping about!  Aug. 28th's Rustica Bianco was definitely a joy to experience!  Or perhaps I'd stayed away too long?  No, this pie really stood apart from the previous Rusticas I've ingested, and I believe it was the added seasoning I detected that I'd never seen before (and didn't see again in the pies that followed).    9/11 was the day Mom and I tried a couple of new items- new to us, that is- the Eggplant parm, which was served in a crust.  I was speechless!  Mom was enjoying her Spinach salad (we ordered it w/ a crust), and didn't care to try the eggplant.  She did, however, tear off a couple of pieces of  the entree's crusty bowl.  This dish is best eaten fresh from the oven, so bring a couple of friends to help you polish it off!  I also learned of the arrival of Nick's (correct me on the supplier's name if I'm wrong, Mitch!) Gelatos on this visit... I was given the green light to sample as many flavors as I'd wanted... I'd enjoyed so many flavors, it was hard to choose one to take back to the table!    We tried a new Rustica variety on 10/1- the Bella Rossa (again, new to us...).  This pizza was absolutely a beauty to behold, and I really enjoyed the wheat crust-- this is the only Rustica variant that is served on wheat.  However, we both found it too salty, which we credited to the presence of olives in the pesto sauce and the sun-dried tomatoes.  Almost docked this review a star, but decided the effort was there, and that wheat crust...    10/12 marked Crust's 3rd ann'y, and I wanted to help Crust celebrate!  Crust's expansion proved to be a smart move, but I couldn't help thinking perhaps Crust should've gone for even more square footage!  The turnout was just unbelievable!  And to mark the special day, I chose two specialy entrees to try: one I'd had my eye on since first visiting Crust a couple of years ago (Sausage, Spinach, and White Beans pasta), and one Mitch is particularly proud of- the Chicken Francese pasta.  We both loved the sausage entree!  I adored the light garlicky sauce, and we both thought the presence of white beans ingenious!  The beans not only enhanced all the other flavors in the dish, but also added a hearty texture that we found very pleasing!  This entree also proved to survive reheating the next day.  Sadly, I've had to give up chicken as a meat option, so it was up to Mom to give me all the details, which I had to wait for until the following night, bec. she'd eaten her fill of Rustica Bianco!  Great news, Mitch-- Mom loved this dish!  The battered and pan-fried chicken cutlets were juicy and paired well w/ the beurre blanc sauce.  No wonder you're a proud Papa!  Four dining events marked by new flavors worthy of a Yelp, and a higher rating!

10/24/12  Crust celebrated its 5th year anniversary today, and as it has in the past four years, it did so by offering 50% off everything on the menu, dine-in only.  Glasses of wine and and a handful of cocktails were also offered for $5 each.  We celebrated by ordering a Strawberry salad, Meatball sliders http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg?select=skLo5ITLHCYc-7KTQ097pQ#skLo5ITLHCYc-7KTQ097pQ, Filet mignon sliders http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg?select=9NBWbmur1iGAYDRAQyfP6w#9NBWbmur1iGAYDRAQyfP6w, a Rustica Bianca (sub artichokes for the tomatoes, $1.50 extra) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg?select=gBqV2d_OzEapAwM7Ih7EIw#gBqV2d_OzEapAwM7Ih7EIw, two glasses of Mango moscato, and a glass of Hey Mambo, a red blend.  Oh, and an order of Warm chocolate chip cookies and ice cream sandwich http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg?select=85Xw1x9f7gzbpLARkjZEhg#85Xw1x9f7gzbpLARkjZEhg.  All were, of course, delightful, although the rustica wasn't as crispy as Mom and I wanted it.  No matter, as I pointed out that we can toast the leftover pizza at home and just enjoy the other items we ordered at the restaurant.  An hour and a half later, our stomachs full, my wallet $72 lighter (which included a $17 tip), and my ears ringing from the deafening noise indoors (my second complaint, which I can overlook on this special date), we left happy and contented.  Thank you, Crust!    Congratulations again to Mitch, Michael, and Duke, and everyone else at Crust, for yet another anniversary milestone, and we hope you have many more!

2/19/13  4.5 stars.  Received a text** from Crust alerting that all entrees were $10 each (dine-in only), so I stopped by after work.  Having combed the menu during one of my breaks, I knew I was going to try two new (to me!) pasta dishes, the Ravioli Pesto Cream and Grandma's Pasta, and a half (crustless) Tuscan salad.  I was welcomed immediately when I entered and was seated.  My server came by shortly with a glass of water and asked if I'd like to order anything else for dinner, so I asked to try a sample of the week's special red blend before I ordered a full glass.  I've rarely been disappointed with their selections, and sure enough, I liked what I tried and asked for a glass.  I placed my food order, tweaking the Ravioli dish a little by asking that the kitchen sub out the usual chopped fresh tomatoes for artichokes (I'd asked Mitch on the phone earlier if this would be OK, and he said "no problem") and asked if I could have some table bread, as well.  Ten minutes passed, and I still hadn't received any bread, nor the small crustless salad I'd ordered, but I was reading while I waited, so I wasn't too worried, although I did ask a passing server to see what was going on.  Around five to ten minutes later, my dishes arrived, and these came with a dinner roll each, so the missing bread was forgotten (although it's always nice to have some extra to enjoy at home).  The salad was still missing, so when my server came by for a check-up, I mentioned it, and he said he'll look into it.  A few minutes later, a full order of a Tuscan salad arrived.  (Because of the mix-up, the salad was on the house- thanks Crust!)  The Pesto Ravioli Cream with artichokes was terrific! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdale?select=FxAhyaHn1yiexaqxjH5P3w#FxAhyaHn1yiexaqxjH5P3w  When I order creamy dishes, whether it's Italian, or Thai, I like the sauces silky and rich in flavor, and this dish certainly fulfilled my expectations.  The ravioli was cooked al dente (perfetto!), and the tangy artichokes served to cut the buttery richness of the sauce.  I LOVED every bite!  The sauce also went well with the dinner roll.  Squisito!  As for Grandma's Pasta http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdale?select=Ip7IWfw0zSUc3hHg8Ni5bQ#Ip7IWfw0zSUc3hHg8Ni5bQ, I can take it, or leave it.  One problem I had with it was that the ricotta was too cold, and I found the clash of hot and cold in this pasta dish a little strange.  I also found that the small chunks of sausage were much tastier than meatballs, and I found myself wishing the dish just contained sausage links, instead of the meatballs, which is a shame, since the meatballs are HUGE!  Last, but not least, the Tuscan salad was delicious!  Loved the peppery arugula, dressed in a housemade Italian vinaigrette, and the white beans, and when I read "homemade croutons," I expected the usual cubed chunks of bread, not the toasted and seasoned slices of bread that adorned the bowl.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdale?select=h8xkl7KOxVxNx5r7m86lyg#h8xkl7KOxVxNx5r7m86lyg  I could order this salad as an entree and a glass of white and be happy!  With so many dining options to choose from in this valley of the Sun, it's great to know that whenever I do dine at Crust, dinner specials or not, I can always find a great meal and walk out happy and satiated!  **To receive Crust specials via SMS, text CRUST to 91944.

01/27/11  Yes, the mango fish rolls http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-breadfruit-phoenix-2?select=kKlpgD3Aa5BpVWDOnaufyg#kKlpgD3Aa5BpVWDOnaufyg were definitely crispy and tasted delicious, and yes, the oven-roasted plantains http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-breadfruit-phoenix-2?select=Q-JPbNWKKO0gMe66G9W2TA#Q-JPbNWKKO0gMe66G9W2TA were firm on the outside and just-like-buttah on the inside, but were they worth $10.50 and $5, plus tax, respectively?  I don't think so.  I took photos of the food w/ a pen next to the plates to show you how small these portions were.  Really, $12 for a small mango fish roll, sliced three-ways?  And I'm supposed to feel good about ordering an entree and dessert after?  The Sweet potato pudd'n http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-breadfruit-phoenix-2?select=GhUFceoWCGwSCHxRw8ZMVA#GhUFceoWCGwSCHxRw8ZMVA was just absolutely fabulous, but you won't catch me driving all the way to The Breadfruit to spend my hard-earned money here.  At least I know they've reinvested some of the profits into remodeling the place... it looked fifty times better than when it did on its first year of opening.  If you wish to dine and converse w/ your companions, it's best not to come here on the weekends, when next door Rum Bar is hopping.  Then again, maybe it was just hopping on this night, bec. of the rum-tasting event held there...  I haven't been back since, so I don't know how busy these two businesses are.

1/14/10 Met Violeta H. and new Yelper friend Aly (D.?) here today for happy hour (HH).  As soon as I walked into the resto, I noticed that the noise level was high, even though there were only 6 or less patrons (including me), plus 3 or 4 employees present.  Ambience was OK- portraits of past actors and actresses (era of Grant, Monroe, and Gardner) and black or dark furniture, etc. Since Violeta had arrived earlier, she already had a glass of wine in front of her.  After a few minutes, our server came and asked if I would like to order a drink- I asked if I could sample a couple of red wines.  I had sensed that he might not have liked this request, but he said sure.  After I'd made my decision and let him know which, he dropped off the selection shortly, but took awhile to bring me a glass of water despite my asking for one earlier.  Again, it wasn't busy at all as it was only around 430p.   Aly D. arrived, and after chatting it up a bit, and waiting for our server to come back (maybe 10 to 15 minutes of lag time), I placed my order of bruschetta of brie, marinated artichoke, and smoked salmon (brie, apple and slivered almonds; artichokes, roasted red pepper pesto and goat cheese; salmon, mascarpone, olives, and capers) and Violeta asked for sweet potato fries.  We continued to chat and sip our wines (Aly D. only drank wine; she didn't have anything to eat), and after about 10 or 15 more minutes, the bruschetta arrived.  After taking a few photos of the dish and offering the two women some of the pieces (Aly refused and V. opted to wait for her fries, which hadn't arrived yet), I chose to start w/ one of the roasted red pepper pieces, and after attempting to knife into a corner, and not succeeding, I picked it up and took a bite.  The bread they chose to serve me was stale!  I spat that out, and, wanting to ask V. or Aly to confirm that the bread was indeed stale, I tried to slice off a piece of bread, and pieces flew across the table.  Finally, I was able to hand a sample to V., who agreed that the bread was stale.  After a few attempts to flag our server down, at last he came back to ask how I was enjoying the app (Violeta's fries still hadn't arrived).  When I told him that the bread was stale, he vehemently denied that the bread could be stale, as their bread is made in-house.  He then just left it at that, panning over the three of us, and after a few uneasy seconds, he asked if I'd like to order something else.  I was taken aback by his reaction to my observation and decided that I didn't want to order anything else, so I just told him to take the app back.  Before he left, Violeta kindly reminded him that she still didn't have her sweet potato fries, so he went back to the kitchen to check on that.  I don't know what the other two were thinking, but I was still reeling from our server's remark and how he had handled the exchange.  A woman came by to drop off the fries, which were tasty and very crispy, just the way I liked it (thanks V. for sharing!), and soon after, our original server arrived back to say that the chef had sampled the returned bruschetta, had agreed that the bread was not up to standards and would like to know if I would like to have another prepared.  I said yes, I'd love to try again.  Finally, a solution was offered!  But why did it take all those many minutes?  The second plate arrived, the obligatory picture-taking done, and I took a bite of the salmon, and all was well again in the universe!  This time the bread was NOT stale, and while I liked all of the selections, I wouldn't order this dish again.   We continued to chat and enjoy our wines, but I still wanted to try something else, so I asked for the Cuban sandwich, which arrived after a few minutes.  (Strange, but I couldn't find a photo of it,nor the fries, in my collection, so perhaps V. or Aly took pics for me?  Please send them over!)  This tasty halved sandwich was quite petite- about three bites, four at the most, and one half had the two kinds of meat- ham and smoked pork (?) and some sort of cheese and the other half only cheese.  My lack of concentration w/ my selection is testimony that I did not enjoy my experience here at D'Vine...   Because of 1.) the many failed attempts to flag our server down, 2.) the long waiting times in between server visits, 3) the lag time of the sweet potato fries, 4.) our server's reaction to the stale bread, 5.) the miniscule sandwich which only had meat in one-half of it, and 6.) the resto's noise when it wasn't even busy (the noise grew as the afternoon turned into night), I will never go back again, not even to try their lunch menu, which is a pity as the eight selections featured, each at $7.49, look promising.  In retrospect, I wished that we had  stood up after the initial reaction to the stale bread and gone with V.'s suggestion to go to Cork and finish happy hour there.  Sorry, but I do not agree that life is divine at D'Vine!

08/31/11  Stumbled onto Chill while exploring the area before settling down for dinner (at Lobby's).  The clerk here was friendly and accommodating w/ sample requests.  After dinner, I came back and ordered a cup of three flavors: dark chocolate, chocolate sugar-free, and panna cotta.  I was delighted w/ all of them!  Surprisingly, my favorite of the three flavors I'd ordered was the one I had not sampled beforehand, the sugar-free chocolate.    I definitely will be back!  Psst!  Don't forget to take a loyalty card w/ you, as she may forget to mention it!

Was in last week shopping for groceries when I noticed a flyer advertising a Peach Festival Brunch, so I made a mental note to come in and check it out!  The flyer said to call and make reservations, but I checked out this location's webpage and saw that no reservations are needed, that all one needed to do was show up!  I think the print-up on the flyer may have kept many away, as the wine bar, where the brunch is being held (yes, it's from 8a to 12p today, so come on over!), only had one couple besides me present.  [Now that I'm finished w/ my breakfast, another couple has sat down.  Me?  I'm typing away as I just realized I'm missing mass (which may also be a factor in why the wine bar is empty), and all bec. I was so excited to try a couple of items on this brunch's menu!]  First of all, the two young women manning the cash register and taking orders are friendly and courteous, and the lone, spectacled, and young chef is also very nice and quite helpful answering my questions regarding to the ingredients of the Peach French toast and the Shakshooka.  Sha-zam wha?  Yep- say it slowly, you can do it!  Shak- shoo- ka.  Shakshooka, an Israeli dish consisting of a base of spicy tomato and pepper stew, w/ eggplant and spinach, w/ two poached eggs on top, and a garnish of feta cheese.  This was, as the first couple exclaimed "fabulous!" when I'd stopped at their table and asked them as I made my way back from the display counter that showcased all the available brunch offerings:    Granola parfait (w/ peach compote) $6 Steel-cut oatmeal (w/ peach compote, agave nectar) $6 French toast $8 Green chile hash (rotisserie chicken, potatoes, grilled onions, roasted poblanos, sunny-side up egg) $8 Breakfast tacos (eggs, chorizo, beans, potatoes, salsa) Shakshooka $8 Grilled peach and arugula salad (radicchio, fennel, pistachio, balsamic vinaigrette) $7  Peach bellinis and Marin French Stinson Beach Peach beer are also available for $4 (6oz) and $5 (22oz), respectively.    What about the peach French toast, you say?  It was many substantial forkfuls of HEAVEN!  There was nothing fluffy about this French toast (and if you know me, you know I DISLIKE fluffy!)  Three slices of WF brand brioche bread, battered, and nicely pan-fried, w/ caramelized peaches, candied walnuts, and homemade apricot jam (made by the young chef himself!) w/ apricots stewed in their own juices, sugar, and currants.  Oh. My. Goodness!  I told them I wished they'd hold breakfast here everyday, or at the very least, every weekend-- I'd come back religiously (pun intended)!  The chef said that they're hoping to build up a demand for it.  This is only the second time they offered something like this-- the first time was about two months ago and was beer-inspired.  I say, y'all must check this breakfast out today!!  There's something for everyone's picky palates.  (And if nothing catches your fancy, or are off-limits to you for some reason, there is always the hot food buffet to check out.  Today's lineup includes enchiladas, scrambled eggs (eggwhites, regular), omelets (Denver, sausage, chicken), potatoes, tofu, apple cinnamon crisp, oatmeal, and crispy bacon, among other things!   And if these aren't enough choices to have, there's always the salad and olive bars, pizzeria, sandwich, gelato, and Smokehouse grill areas to peruse!

Was just here last night shopping for organic fruits (Gala apples, bananas, and seedless white grapes) and organic almond butter (searched for 365 brand, which was out-of-stock, so I bought Maisie Jane's, instead).  I just love the large produce area at this location, which WF Mayo seems to always have someone present and constantly stocking shelves with fruits and vegetables.  I had called ahead to ask if there were organic bananas and Gala apples (specifically Royal Gala), so I knew that the banana supply was running low.  I unfortunately didn't find any Royal Gala apples, so I had to make do with the small, yet gorgeous Gala apples on display.  I thought I'd update my reviews here by mentioning that there will be an ice cream social event on Saturday, July 27th, from 2p to 5p, or so an e-newsletter informed me this morning!  I clicked on the Facebook link to get more information, which led me to a WF website link that stated "all Whole Foods" will be participating.  I wish I could go, because not only will WF have their own brand of ice cream on-hand, but one of my favorite organic brands, Three Twins, is going to be featured, and both email and website state that for every Three Twins purchase made, one dollar will be donated to the Non-GMO Project!  To find out more this organization, please visit nongmoproject.com.  The website mentioned all WF stores are participating, but that "some stores might have sweet concoctions up their sleeve like sundaes, shakes, floats and malts and many are planning fun events for kids and adults alike..."    Wish I could attend the event myself, but I'll be at work, so for those of you planning to attend, just have an extra tablespoon of ice cream for me!  :)  Read more about the event here http://wholefoodsmarket.com/blog/youre-cordially-invited-ice-cream-social-july-27?sf15241907=1

4.5 stars!  Oh, how do I love thee Whole Foods, let me count the ways!  1.  Only at WF may I find organic whole wheat breads that do not contain vinegar (distilled or grain, unless apple/cider comes before it, it's made from corn), or flax, or cornmeal, or...  BUT please bring back Dave's Organic Killer Breads 100% Whole Wheat.  Pretty please?  With organic cherries on top?  2.  Free samples!  I stopped a roving WF employee and asked if I may break off a piece of an already broken almond horn (in one of the pastry cases next to the coffee/smoothie dept.), and he said he'd ask one of the baristas if I may, and he came back and told me he could let me choose a whole piece to sample!  Sweet!  However, either the one bite from the almond horn, or this Maca malt beverage I am drinking, is making my stomach do flip-flops and intermittent spasms.  Getting a little worried right now.  :/  3.  Roasted, crunchy almond butter!  Ingredients: Roasted almonds.  That's it!  Stir and refrigerate.  No palm oil, nor salt, included.    4.  Large selection of organic frozen desserts, both dairy and non-dairy. 4b.  Three Twins Organic Ice Creams!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/whole-foods-market-phoenix-2?select=ASRcLT_bPmvpg_RM98ILEQ#ASRcLT_bPmvpg_RM98ILEQ  5.  Super-convenient kiosks to order custom-made foods from!  Burgers, hot and cold custom sandwiches, pizzas, tacos/burritos, sushi (never tried, since the prepared section have takeaway, which list preservatives among the ingredients), and more!  Too bad these kiosks don't stay open later that 7p, or 8p...  6.  Wine and craft beer counter!  I haven't imbibed any, from here or restaurants elsewhere, for a long time, so I don't know if WF offers organic wine and beer by the glass.  I'll ask next time.  7.  Mighty Maca Malt: Maca powder, banana, chocolate, chia seeds, almond milk (asked if this was organic and was told "yes"), coconut flakes.  Delicious, but banana flavor was the strongest, followed by coconut.  I was hoping for more chocolate goodness.  I really liked the hint of coconut, as well as the texture from the flakes.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/whole-foods-market-phoenix-2?select=BsHnL7k5SoD3Qoyt2nic0w#BsHnL7k5SoD3Qoyt2nic0w  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/whole-foods-market-phoenix-2?select=FuPuMUzjpFtTLs3dNY0cIg#FuPuMUzjpFtTLs3dNY0cIg  And so on... So why only 4.5 stars, and not 5???  Because of the ever-increasing number of products containing corn syrup (HFCS, plain, or corn sugar-- same thing) I see every time I look! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/whole-foods-market-phoenix-2?select=zG39-ljXqDQKPohfpNFAOQ#SOyBCAnJChTFsVg4ZVSRhQ

Took Mamang (grandma), my two cousins Melissa and Monique, and I to Stacy's yesterday and had ourselves a great BBQ meal!  $30 (w/ tax and tip) bought us some very tasty treats:  1 pork sandwich 1/2 pound of rib tips 8 oz. coleslaw sweet yams large sweet fries red beans and rice corn bread  While we enjoyed the rib tips, we thought there was more value to the pork in the sandwich.  Most of the weight in the 1/2 lb. rib tips were bone and fatty tissue w/c I refuse to ingest (marbled fat is hard to trim, but visible fat I trim off and that fat I can distinguish texturally with the glorious oral muscle we call the tongue I, hopefully w/ grace, discard off to the side).  The coleslaw and yams were excellent!  Melissa didn't think the gorgeous coleslaw had mayonnaise.  The sweet fries were soggy and greasy- next time I'll pass.  The dish of red beans and rice was very good, but a little too salty.  Easily amendable, and I'd order it again!  My cousins and Grandma said the cornbread was good, but Monique would've liked more crunchiness in the bread (she takes after me).  For her second piece, she requested a corner slice, w/c, and I realized just at this moment, Stacy graciously provided by baking a fresh batch!  I'll have to remember to thank him especially for this gesture the next time I visit.  While the rest of us had iced water (I recommend not to drink when the ice has melted... nasty!), Monique had the sweet tea, w/c I had a sip.  Good, but too sweet for me (or perhaps I was just saving my calories for the delicious feast I knew was in store!).  Tangentially, we appreciated how nice and warm it was inside, but I can imagine how hot this smokehouse can get in the late spring, summer, and fall!

Rereading my post, I'm aware that my review may sound to be a negative one, but I want to make it clear that I did enjoy the flavors of the dishes I tried.  It was the less-than warm reception to the questions I had asked- a perception I haven't had in a VERY long time (all the venues I've been to for many months, a few years, even, have been quite accomodating), and the long wait times I encountered affected the tone of this review.   --- I've had this "Taste of Phoenix" giftcard (purchased through Costco) good at restaurants such as Tapino, Picazzo Gourmet Pizza, Medizona, and Little Rangoon since pre-Christmas, so I decided to go for my first LRvisit last Friday.  Alfred, who I later found out is one of the venue's two owners (found a business card w/ his name on it), showed me to one of the corner tables (there were two occupied tables indoors and a full table outdoors).    After food allergy issues were covered, I ordered the two items I spotted on the online menu beforehand- Chicken satay app and Dhal curry.  I was starving and was thankful for the complimentary fried wontons and questionary dipping sauce.  It looked somewhat akin to Chinese duck sauce and was sure to contain allergenic ingredients (Alfred didn't check on the info).  Though I was almost starving, I had to ask Alfred to take the plate away, even though 2/3 of the wonton chips remained.  Thankfully, the two menu items I ordered almost arrived simultaneously, albeit after what I thought was a long wait for an app dish and soup (15 minutes for homemade soup I can understand, but 15 minutes for an appetizer of four 4"x1" skewers of grilled chicken skewers?).  Though it wasn't as dark in the restaurant as my photos would lead you to believe, the somewhat fatty satay skewers didn't have that gorgeous caramelization I'm used to seeing in other venues and as such did not strike me as "grilled to perfection" as stated on the menu.  The serving temperature of the skewers also seemed closer to room temperature than straight from the grill, but at least I was able to eat these right away since the Dhal curry was so hot, I had to let it cool for at least ten minutes.  The paratha that accompanied the curry was nicely plump and flaky when it first arrived, and, fortunate for me, I tore a piece and tried it with the too-hot curry then and so was able to enjoy its flakiness.  After devouring the slightly luke-warm satay skewers, which were very good when paired with the DELICIOUS peanut sauce (although I found it visually off-putting), I turned my attention to the curry soup, which was still very hot, but was so tasty that I decided to plow ahead (an almost visual truth since I was hungry!).  The split pea and lentil soup was a satisfying meal, yet I was expecting a more viscous consistency, closer to hummus, although I cannot fathom why, since dhal/daal curries of Indian cuisine are also on the watery side (at least Pasand's and Udupi Cafe's were, as I recall).  The cooled paratha was disappointing at this point since the flakiness was almost nonexistent, and the bread's texture was now almost pasty.  Should I order the dhal curry dish again, I'll have to ask that the paratha be brought out after the soup's cooled for a few minutes.  I hope to visit soon for lunch where I hope I'll be able to give a higher rating.  In the meantime, please enjoy the pics I've included!  :)  Be warned- it took at least fifteen minutes for my check to arrive, despite the fact there were only three or four tables occupied at any given time (around ten people or under that).  Thought I'd also mention that while the take-out menu only indicated two dessert items (Sanwin Makin and Mango-coconut pudding), the server did show me a menu with many intriguing gelato desserts ranging from $3 scoops to $5-$8 sundaes and other creations!  Since I had the impression that Alfred didn't appreciate the food allergy questions I posed to him earlier, I wasn't in the mood to go into more detail with the gelatos' ingredients.  'Twas a shame, since my sweet tooth was raging after having consumed the spicy curry soup.

9/3 Walked in ten minutes before 6p.  Just in time to order a few apps during happy hour!  However, half-priced happy hour apps and beverages were very limited in number and marked with smiley faces, and they were so hard to spot on the menu!  Perhaps having only ten minutes to hunt them down exacerbated my difficulty of spotting them, but I hope the managers consider having separate easy-to-read menus printed and used.  Liked that martini-drinkers have many martinis to select from. Tried a couple of rolls, but I can't recall much to write about except that I would probably come back to try other apps and entrees not on the HH menu, but I'm in no hurry to go back.

10/29  Met Violeta H. for happy hour.  Loved the atmosphere here!  Warm shades of amber and gold, and textures of cork, wood, and metal married beautifully.  It was only later, when presented w/ paybooks that looked and felt like cork, that I noticed that the floor tile was made to look like cork!  Cunning, this, I thought.    [In our excitement to finally try Cork for the first time, I'd neglected to tell V. that Andrea K. might try to join us later on (and later still, Andrea's friend Brynn!)].  Violeta and I started our most enjoyable evening by ordering champagne.  Hers was flavored w/ Kir (cherry liqueur) and mine w/ St. Germain elderflower.  It was very good, and soon it was time to order another; Violeta ordered more of the Kir, and I, impressed that she found it so great to order it again, ordered one myself.  Unfortunately, I didn't find it as agreeable, so I asked if it could be replaced with a Bellini, instead.  No problem.  This version went down smoothly, albeit too smoothly (and way too fast!), as it was much sweeter than the elderflower.  For my third flute, I went back to my original choice (if only to make the drink last longer!).  Violeta and Andrea later tried the elderflower and liked it.  For our "entree," I ordered the Prime Better Burger, cooked medium, while V. ordered the grilled cheese.  My burger was decadent: bottom layer consisted of 4 oz. prime burger w/ aged cheddar, and topped w/ 4 oz. shortrib, w/ garnishes of wild mushrooms, sun-dried tomato, and aioli.  Violeta's grilled cheese was equally wicked- slices of Granny Smith apples, bacon, and brie encased in toasted cranberry-walnut bread!  While I enjoyed my burger, I found it too indulgent; I'd definitely order the grilled cheese, in a heartbeat!  I think I was in the middle of finishing my entree when Andrea joined us, and may have offered her a bite, which she may have liked so much, that she ordered a burger for herself.  Such a shame that her burger, ordered medium, came out more on the rare side... I was able to talk Andrea into trying the arancini with me after failing miserably w/ Violeta :o  I thank the heavens Andrea played along, because the arancini was freakin' amazing!  Andrea and Brynn would agree!  A clear highlight of the evening.  Tonight's flavor was Marconi almond pesto.  The menu stated that the flavors change daily.  Cannot wait to return and try a new version!  For dessert, Violeta ordered a sorbet trio (which I thought was a bit on the safe side; I like rich desserts!), while I asked for banana creme pie.  Beautiful presentation!  What first struck me were the banana slices- these four pieces were given the torch treatment a la creme brulee.  Loved the amber color!  Then, the white and dark chocolate cigarettes propped onto the generous mound of toasted marshmallow!  Mmm... Every slice of the fork into the pie yielded a perfect ratio of mallow, banana cream, and graham cracker crust... Even the long, narrow river of chocolate sauce in the middle was just enough to add yet another level of exquisiteness to this dessert! If you like bananas, you owe it to yourself to visit soon and order this!    What an amazing meal shared with fantastic women!  Thank you V and our new friends Andrea and Brynn!  To top the evening off, owner Robert sent us a round of late harvest Gewurtztraminer!  Funny, I was the only one who finished a pour...

12/18/09 How I LOVE this place!  The grilled cheese gets me everytime!  I'll even get cheesy (pun intended!) and borrow a few words from a popular Cowboy Ciao quote- This dish is so good, it makes me want to get naked and roll in it!  The "orangini" that night (chicken and risotto rolled together, deep-fried, then set on an marcona almond pesto) was just-OK.  Nothing to write home about.  I think I'm done w/ arancini... maybe not.  I think it was the chicken that turned me off.  Still ate both pieces, though.  Oh, but the grilled cheese!   BTW, I met a couple of friends here, who, just like me, fell in love w/ the St. Germain elderflower champagne and red wine!  Thanks for another great afternoon, Cork!

4/10/10  Took my cousin from out-of-town (NJ) here for happy hour!  Yes, we had drinks (a hibiscus margarita for me, and I think she had a champagne cocktail), and yes, we shared a grilled cheese sandwich- so fool-proof, it's guaranteed I'll enjoy myself there.  FYI, so did she!  We also tried the Jalapeno-Crusted Ahi Tuna, which usually comes on fry bread, and sits on a bed of almond hummus and garnished w/  raita.  Our version, w/out my requesting, came w/ pesto instead of the hummus.  We loved it!  My cousin enjoyed her light meal here.  I just wished we had more time to have a larger meal, but other engagements that day had us moving on.  Next time I visit, I'll have to skip on the grilled cheese and try something off the dinner menu.  (Just had a look, and there are so many calling my name!)

Having spotted a $28 Dior Addict (Stiletto... a word that sounds sexy, yet dangerous... recall Fonda's Single White Female) I really wanted days ago at Sephora, I decided to check out two department store makeup counters to see if they were offering a "gift w/ purchase."  (Turned out that the "gift w/ purchase" promotion will not be offered till September.)  Macy's turned out to be my first and my last stop that day due to time constraints, the way I was treated, and the fact that the Macy's rep behind the Dior counter quoted me a lower price for the lipsticks I wanted to purchase- I was going to buy at least two ( Stiletto and Envy), and I also started looking into the $30 Rouge Dior colors and the $34 Serum Rouge selections.  Since I am not fond of returning tainted lipsticks, I proceeded to sample some of the testers using the disposable brushes they have for customers to use.  It wasn't long before a woman permanently parked herself behind and to the right of me where I could see her. Even though I greeted her a nice hello and continued to sample colors, after awhile, I felt so uncomfortable, that I decided I'd just stick to the two choices I initially made, since I can always come back if I ended up liking the products.    The original rep rang my purchases up, and the total was higher than I estimated it to be.  I asked her why, and she said that she'd looked at another product's tag when I had asked her earlier for the price.  Since it was only a few dollars, I decided I'd let it go, and left Macy's.    I returned to Sephora a few days later to restock on Clinique colors that I love.  I always buy three or more of these at a time to eventually replace the almost-new ones I have already, since the bases fall prey to Arizona's heat and break off.  (I don't have the patience, nor the time, to save these broken pieces in pots and apply them on w/ lipstick brushes.  I wish I did, for I would then have the extra cash to spend on my other hobbies of dining out and watching movies at Camelview!)  Anyhoo, I ended up buying five colors, which amounted to around $77, including tax (three for me, and two to gift Mom w/, because I like her).  See Macy's?  If you didn't make me feel like I was a marked crook by sending your guard, who was ready to jump me at the slightest move, I'd have spent so much more money splurging on my favorite makeup items at your counters, rather than at other stores.  I'm not even pondering on how the rep mislead me by quoting the wrong price-- OK I will... How could she do that when I specifically gave her the product's line and color to look up?  Nevermind.  I'm making it a point to boycott this particular location.  Should I ever want to buy anything from a Macy's, I'll either go to the one in Chandler, or to another state even!  Perhaps I'll just spend my money at Dillard's and Sephora.

Stopped by for happy hour in early May.  Sat at the bar, which was still empty as it was only 4:30p.  After inquiring about menu items and possible allergens, I settled on the beef kabobs ($8 during happy hour), and the table bread basket (white and flatbread), which both contained allergens- I only had the nerve to try the white, which was good with the pesto butter.  The four 3-inch skewers consisted of tiny chunks of seasoned beef, tri-colored bell peppers, and onions with a chipotle sauce and mayo.  These were tasty, but not worth $8, or the long wait (One: they're kabobs, which usually do not take long to cook!  Two: they're MINI kabobs!)  I'll give EH another try.  Sometime, but not soon.

Was looking forward to having lunch here after a root canal at nearby Gilbert.  This venue was much smaller than I had imagined, and the view from the outside wasn't as pretty as it was once inside.  The room is L-shaped, with the long side being a little more private than the short side, which faces the street.  Recognized the rectangular white wave-patterned artwork from the night shots (where it glows orange).  I'd like to come back and see how the ambience changes at night!  Started out with tom kha gai, not only bec. it's a fave Thai soup of mine, but also bec. the veggies did not include any food allergies I have to worry about.  While my server placed my soup order, I searched the menu for green curry, but couldn't find it.  Later on, I was told that it is only offered during dinner as a seafood green curry.  I spotted a few items that looked interesting, but finally decided on the chicken red curry- chicken with spicy red curry, fresh bamboo shoots, sweet peas, and jasmine rice.  After confirming with the kitchen that their housemade red curry did not contain *, I placed my entree order and waited for my soup.  The soup arrived and I immediately spotted pieces of * floating about in the soup, and told my server I couldn't accept it as I was allergic to *.  This was immediately corrected with a bowl that now had the inclusion of tomato wedges- yet another item that was not listed in the soup's description.    The tom kha gai tasted wonderfully spicy from the red chilies, deliciously sour from the lemongrass and kaffir lime, and silky from the coconut milk.  Quite beautiful to gaze at and exquisite to savor!  The chicken red curry was equally satisfying, if not a little too salty; I loved the deep orange-red color of the curry and how creamy it looked.  The presentation was beautiful, although the execution was a little sloppy- I detected fingerprints and a bit of dried food while positioning the dish for a few shots.  Again, the finished entree included red bell pepper, which is a favorite veggie of mine, not only bec. it tastes sweet and adds a crunchy element, but also bec. it is an anti-inflammatory food that also provides beta-carotene and vitamin C!!  I planned on having dessert elsewhere so I skipped on the one item that caught my eye- Thai sweet custard served in a mini-pumpkin!  Definitely one to try on my next visit.  I couldn't keep from trying something sweet, however, so I ordered a Thai iced tea- sweetened iced tea with a little half-and-half.  It was perfect!  Not too sweet and I could definitely taste the tea along with the cream.  A definite must-try!

09/30/12  Brought my three aunts, Mom, and myself to The Farm at South Mountain on this rare occasion we were all together, and since the aunts had never been before.  After first dropping off two aunts and Mom at Morning Glory Cafe so that they may place breakfast orders in, an aunt and I walked over to The Farm Kitchen to line up and order a couple of sandwiches and use a groupon I had found a week or so before ($10 for $20 worth of food).  Since our venture out to the farm was on a whim, we were not prepared to endure eating outside when it was 100 degrees, and thankfully, there weren't many people out here thinking it was a great idea, either.  Usually, there's a long line, sometimes double lines, of people waiting to order fresh-made sandwiches and salads, but not today, which was a good thing for the two of us.  Since I'd pulled up the menu online on my phone and asked my aunts what looked good to them on our drive to the farm, we already knew what to order when our wait was over in line, when the two women before us waved us along since they didn't know what they wanted.  Grabbing the last slice of Cherry-White Chocolate Bread Pudding http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jb7pFtM4J5Hu9tCaoGxnRQ?select=47BeU9YNiWBOmxj9yOXCCQ#47BeU9YNiWBOmxj9yOXCCQ on a table of sweets I spied just seconds before, while my aunt took a Roasted Squash Creme Brulee, we thanked the women and proceeded to order the Old Fashioned Turkey Sandwich http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jb7pFtM4J5Hu9tCaoGxnRQ?select=3gTmvP1BjPjiJUHExlk0xA#3gTmvP1BjPjiJUHExlk0xA and the Pecan Chicken Salad Sandwich.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jb7pFtM4J5Hu9tCaoGxnRQ?select=pRMWUUIbNUNcp6re4qBK0w#pRMWUUIbNUNcp6re4qBK0w  The groupon redemption was a breeze, and we were given a receipt with a number and were told to wait outside for the call.  The wait wasn't long at all, and after a brief stop at the non-lighted outdoor restroom facility, I joined my aunt to pick up our basket of sandwiches, and we proceeded to walk back to the Morning Glory Cafe to meet the others.  Since I had a terrific breakfast a few hours ago in Phoenix, I hadn't planned to try much at The Farm today, but I did get to taste a few bites here and there.  The bread pudding was very, very good!  Chunks of chewy, yet moist cherries, rivers of sweet white chocolate and butterscotch running throughout and on the top, this was a beauty of a dessert to behold AND to consume!  Loved how the top of the pudding had spots of caramelization, and if you look closely, there's a wide river of butterscotch silk beckoning you to drink.  The bread pudding was so enticing that a young woman and her beau (or was it her brother?) immediately left their family table at MG to try their luck at TFK for more of the bread pudding (after a long absence, around 15 minutes or more, they came back with a slice!).  The sandwiches were also hits!  Due to food allergies, I couldn't try the chicken salad sandwich, but suffice it to say, the aunt who'd requested it ate almost the entire thing (only half of the sandwich is pictured; the other half was in her hands!).  Mom and an aunt, or two, were lucky recipients of a bite, and they all said it was delicious.  Much more so than that of the turkey sandwich, of which I was able to try, and it was very good!  The turkey tasted fresh, the chipotle mayo was just the right amount, the whole-grain bread was nutty, yet tender (everyone raved about this bread), and the cranberry relish was chunky and flavorful.  If I wasn't full from breakfast, I'd have asked for half of this.  Again, the sandwich was also completely polished off.  The only thing we didn't like was the Roasted Squash Creme Brulee, but I don't think we gave it a fair try.  I was already done for the rest of the afternoon (I didn't event think about anything to eat until around 530p-6p), but I did try a teaspoonful... I could definitely taste the roasted squash, and it was more savory than sweet.  After indulging on the bread pudding, this tiny taste wasn't worth the extra caloric splurge.  At around $5 or $6 a serving, I probably wouldn't try it if I came across it again.  I'll be back, but not until the weather cools!

Before leaving home for work this morning, I emailed Sweet Republic to ask if any of the flavors offered this week are free of corn syrup since I was getting out early from work today.  I thought I'd leave it to fate to decide for me if I was swinging by SR or heading straight home from work.  Helen quickly replied with a list and even emailed a second time to determine if I was allergic to all corn products [yes I am :(].  My answer eliminated all of the sorbets, but she did say that the Tart Yogurt soft-serve is safe for me.   First sample was the Tart yogurt, and yes, it was tart, palate-cleansing, and quite refreshing.  I would definitely order this on a cake cone someday, or have it in a cup with fresh strawberries!  Other flavors I tried were:  Chocolate Rosemary- D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S.  I am a fan of rosemary, a relaxing herb, so the combination of the two flavors was like "the calm before the storm"; first, the whiff of rosemary enveloped me in a comforting embrace and then I was knocked over by bold chocolate!  This was definitely going into the pint cup I was taking home with me.  I knew I had to find another flavor that could stand up to this perfect duet.  Apple Pie- LOVED the textures in this ice cream.  Chunks of granny smith apples and bits of ginger and cinnamon spice.  Such huge flavors from such a tiny sample.  Unbelievable!  A huge contender in the pint-to-go category.  Sumatra Espresso Shot- WINNER!  I could definitely taste real espresso in this sample.  It'll be hard to find a better version than this!  And yes, I took home a pint of Chocolate Rosemary and Sumatra Espresso Shot.  I had to taste it when I got home, and I'm ashamed to admit that the container was only half-full when it finally found its way into the freezer.  I was slightly disappointed that I couldn't take home some Apple Pie, but Apple Pie, Espresso, and Chocolate Rosemary just didn't sound right.  I'm sure Helen and Jan can offer up something clever on my next visit!    Maple Pecan- I had high expectations for this one, since I love pecans, but all I tasted was fine maple, and the pecans only gave the ice cream a crunchy texture.  Perhaps the bold flavors of apple, ginger, coffee, and chocolate saturated my tastebuds, and I therefore couldn't taste anything else.  I'm going to need to sample this first thing on my next visit.  Belgian Chocolate- Smoooooooth!  Oh yeah!  I had Helen whip up a brownie sundae incorporating scoops of Belgian Chocolate and Vanilla Bean, brownie chunks, fresh whip cream, and a long drizzle of Salted Butter Caramel sauce.  Oh my!  I am at a loss for words...   Other store offerings include fresh-baked cookies (chocolate chip, meringue, molasses spice, and peanut butter), a buffet of toppings, ice cream sandwiches, and ice cream pies.  The store's interior was clean, colorful, and inviting.   Kudos to Helen and Jan for offering up such high-quality sweets.  Now if only I could persuade them to add chocolate-dipped waffle cones and bowls to their cone selections of NAKED (not like Sweet Republic needs to add a sex element to sell its goodies!) waffle cones and waffle bowls.  Well, alright, the cones did have chocolate chips in the bottom, but it's just not the same.  Then again, with ice cream sandwiches and pies, shakes, sundaes, and cookies, who needs chocolate-dipped cones??

After hitting Grapes on Shea and Scottsdale for happy hour today- review coming shortly (maybe... hey, I've 12 other reviews that need to be written!), I headed to Sweet Republic for a sweet ending.  I'd received a newsletter from SR that there were new flavors in honor of Valentine's Day, and I thought what a great reason to pay SR another visit! Of the two Valentine specials, Raspberry White Chocolate and White Roses, I could only sample the latter, as the former contained an allergen.  I'm a sucker for floral-scented food and drink, and this SR delight was a winner!  I could definitely taste roses, and the sweet cream wasn't too sweet.  Loved it!  I also sampled Desert Honey (a tart yogurt sweetened w/ local AZ wild desert honey), Almond Buttercrunch, Salted Butter Caramel, Cheese Course Duo, Espresso, and Mango Lassi.  I took a pint of White Roses and Desert Honey ($7.50) and a scoop of Salted Butter Caramel to-go and a scoop of Almond Buttercrunch in a waffle cone (2 scoops $4.25 + $1 for waffle cone) to savor!  I couldn't pass up a Chocolate Chip Walnut Oatmeal cookie ($3) as it looked so delicious on its cake display stand- one of the proprietors, Helen, offered to warm it up in the microwave.  What a wonderful suggestion!  I asked if she could tear off a section and warm it up...  The warmed bite I took at the store was amazingly good!  (I did notice that the rest of the soft-batch cookie, sampled in the car, was definitely saltier than I'd wish for in a cookie.  Why didn't I detect this saltiness in the warmed-up section?  Perhaps the sweetness of the almond buttercrunch made my tastebuds more sensitive to salt?  Hmm...)  I really enjoyed the almond buttercrunch and the cone, so much so that I wished I'd skipped on the salted butter caramel- heresy some fans of this flavor might think, but what can I say?  I loved extra textural component, and the buttery toffee-sweet crunch, that the almonds provided.  I may be back, maybe as soon as tomorrow!, to re-visit the espresso and the mango lassi (and grab a few more of those chocolate chip walnut cookies!).  ;)  p.s.  Couldn't resist and just had to taste a couple scoopfuls of desert honey and white roses before placing the pint in the freezer... Oh. My. God!  Run to SR before Valentine's Day is over and White Roses disappear from the rotation!  (Just remember to bring your credit card- a visit could get expensive!)

8/20 This grocery-slash-eatery reminds me more of Cafe Istanbul in terms of its lighter traffic than that of Haji-Baba's eatery and market.  Some of the items on the shelves had a light blanket of dust... Ordered the beef kabob (2 pcs.) platter, with lettuce, onions, hummus, and two pitas.  The kabobs were tasty, even though they were slightly overdone in temperature.  Liked the pitas, disliked the hummus.  I couldn't taste any flavors from the chickpeas, tahini, or spices.  Just that of an oil I couldn't even place its origin.  As I was finishing up the kabobs and pita, I spied two young men enjoying their beef shawarmas, so I ordered one to-go.  Got into my car and couldn't wait to have a bite...  I should've gone with my first choice (of beef shawarma)- this was a very tasty selection.  I'd come back to order it again.  I also enjoyed a Lebanese baked dessert, almost cake-like, with two distinct layers- slightly sweet cheese, reminiscent of dried-out ricotta and cream cheese, on the bottom and golden-orange wheat (semolina?), topped with crushed pistachios.  A side sauce dish of simple syrup accompanied the dessert.  I had asked the woman behind the counter two times what the dish was called, and she didn't sound too confident in telling me that she knew it as "shmeer."  (It's the closest thing I could decipher.  Perhaps "shmeed" might be a better word... can anyone help me?)  The ff. is the closest image I found to what I think I had.  (If so, then my dessert was missing the ashtar topping, a type of clotted cream, pictured below.)  The dessert I bought doesn't even come close to approaching the wow factor of this link's image... Kanefe/Knefeh.  http://grabyourfork.blogspot.com/2007/08/rabeih-sweets-punchbowl.html

Came here to register a few months ago and was impressed w/ this hidden gem!  I've yet to go back, but I really did find the area beautiful, inside and out.  We were only indoors long enough to sign up for library cards, so I didn't have much time to explore, but it seems the library has everything one could want-- books, DVDs, CDs, newspapers, and magazines.  I recall thinking there were so many nooks where one could hide and chill for a few hours...  We spent more time taking photos outdoors at a few copper/metal art sculptures and in the garden area leading to the library itself.  Really cool artwork here- a VERY pleasant surprise, especially since we wanted to take advantage to check out using e-books using the library's website!  The woman at the registration/help desk was very helpful and accommodating-- a very refreshing change from the usual wham-bam thank you Ma'am or nonchalant attitudes one could expect from other venues' customer service reps.  Perhaps working at a beautiful and tranquil space such as the Arabian Library had something to do w/ that amiable woman's outlook that day?  :)  Can't wait to go back and explore!  Added bonus:  AL is near the McDowell Sonoran Preserve!  Spending a few minutes/hours hiking around the preserve and then chilling at the library afterwards sounds like a great way to spend the day to me...

6/8/12  All that we tried from here were simply terrific!  If our next visit is just as great as our first, I'm sure I wouldn't have a problem bumping my rating up to five stars.  :)  So, why not give five stars outright?  I'd have to say it was due to my slight disappointment in the atmosphere...  We came in and were immediately greeted by the cashier at the counter, which was situated right in front of the entrance and to the right of the pastry display cases.  The coffee preparation area is behind and to the right of the cashier.  All of this served to show just how busy the staff members were: the pastry chefs working in the back, who would come out to deliver fresh-baked goodies and refill the cases, the cashier taking orders at the counter, a couple of people manning the coffee area (preparing espressos, lattes, mochas, and French presses, just to name a few), and a few more going in and out of the kitchen preparing sandwiches and other items.  This gave the place a bistro feel.  I suppose I was expecting a little more laid-back and romantic cafe, with an in-house bakery in the back- I quickly got over it.  Amelie's is a patisserie with a cafe attached to it.  We sat ourselves at the set of love seat, chairs, and coffee table across from the cashier and the bakery's entrance, so for the most part of our meal, my views of the pastry cases and the rest of the cafe were blocked by lines of people ordering and paying at the cashier-- not conducive to a relaxing breakfast/brunch.  I kept wishing there was a wood panel screen between our table and the traffic of people to give us some privacy.    Since Mom and sis had no idea of what to order, I decided to start us out with some coffee and chocolate croissants.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=HDYOAV5vs4XcZ6w78MUhJA#HDYOAV5vs4XcZ6w78MUhJA  Everyone wanted coffee, including me, but I also wanted to try AFB's mocha, so I ordered a large French press (serves 3 or 4) and a mocha latte.  I expected traditional style croissants, so AFB's slightly disappointed me presentation-wise, but as long as the pastries taste delicious, I don't mind, and these croissants were terrific, and they also kept well for the next two days through our vacay in FL.  Among the boxed pastries we took to go http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=9vjplh1WbJP09ORFska_Yw#9vjplh1WbJP09ORFska_Yw, I really loved the eclairs, which also kept well.  I thoroughly enjoyed the bite through the outer bread layers to find the chocolate filling; It was amazingly creamy and light, yet not fluffy (I don't do fluffy), and the eclairs stayed fresh through numerous times of refrigeration and thaws.  My sis enjoyed her bites of one salted caramel brownie, but interestingly enough, didn't eat the rest of it, nor touch the second one.  They seemed very rich...  I also enjoyed the Napoleon's crunch and buttercream-textured custard filling, but for fear of clogged arteries, I think I'll stay away from now on.  :)  As for the savory selections, sister and Mom absolutely LOVED the chicken salad sandwich!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=TF7ywxMfFxd18pZlDheguw#TF7ywxMfFxd18pZlDheguw  Mom and  I really enjoyed the ham and gruyere tartine-- I loved the crunch of the toasted baguette and thought the saltiness of the cheese and ham paired well with the sweet-goodness of my mocha and croissant.  Yes, we've all decided to make AFB our first stop from the airport on our trips back to the Queen City!  p.s.  Amelie's is open 24/7!

7/26/12  If you're looking for atmosphere, you won't find it here.  It's also very loud (I went during lunch hours), and you're most likely going to have to wait, unless you come during the tail-end of lunch.  (There's a sign posted on the wall by the door that stated to the effect that for those customers who did not want to or could not wait, then please visit Narai Thai and Sushi down a few doors.  To some people, it might come off as abrupt, and even slightly rude, but I thought that was generous of Thai House to post...  Both places are good, and Narai Thai has atmosphere.)   What you will find are a great Chicken panang http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JdtJ3jmMukLXU-gDjVTEgg?select=UMYl4OVwixbiNkHhZM1P2Q#x0sI8WU7hgYveO5nGEFk1A and a terrific bowl of Curry noodles!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JdtJ3jmMukLXU-gDjVTEgg?select=UMYl4OVwixbiNkHhZM1P2Q#RDHeNq9Ld9h5-6imL9WDRg  The curries here are rich and very silky-- just how I prefer them!  The Thai iced tea I had was also very, very good (not too sweet).  What I didn't like was that the lunch specials only featured the entree and your choice of soup/salad and steamed white/fried rice.  No egg roll.  Probably a healthier option, but still... :(  I didn't care for the salad dressing, a sweet vinaigrette.  Next time, I'm going to specify dry.    What really sealed the deal here for me was the service!  I cannot wait to go back and try the other menu items!

After first visiting neighbor Manila Bakery and buying a few treasures, I decided I'd give Pho Van a try.  I rarely indulge in pho since it's   a.  a broth- it is high in sodium b.  a noodle soup- it is full of empty-calorie, high-glycemic index noodles!    But I made a deal with myself that if there is a child-size pho in the menu, and I'm allowed to order it, then I'm going to have some!  Wouldn't you know it, after surveying the apps and entree pages, there it was, on the ff. page, "kid's bowl of pho $3.50, choice of meatballs or eyeround."  And yes, I, a thirty-something Filipina who is often-mistaken to be in her late-teens/early 20's, was able to order it!  I chose the eyeround since you never know what else gets ground up and incorporated in meatballs, or other processed meats for that matter.  (Speaking of processed meats, have any of you seen the section on hotdogs on "How it is Made"?  I never was a fan of hotdogs save the redhots from my childhood in Manila- I loved them fried, sliced, and eaten with steamed white rice... mmmm!- anyhoo, as I was saying, I never was a fan, and that episode has me weaned off of almost all hotdogs for life!)  Back to the review, the eyeround pho was deliciously good eatin'- hot, salty, broth with rings of onion and sliced green onions (scallions to some) made perfect with the addition of basil, mint, and a few squeezes of lime (comes in a separate dish with chilies- jalapenos, to which I'm allergic).  The rice noodles, most of which I left in the bowl, made a nice bed for all the flavors to marry together.  I ended the meal with che ba mau, the tri-color delight of yellow mung beans, red mung beans, green jelly, coconut milk, and shaved ice.  I did tweak it a bit and requested zero green jelly- I do not particularly enjoy chewy gelatin laced with food coloring in icy delights.  The Vietnamese version of the icy treat I remember from my childhood (halo-halo), with extra yellow beans, sent me over the moon!    Nice decor, tasteful tv screens, and the staff was friendly and non-intrusive.  After some time, someone turned on modern Vietnamese pop music- the volume wasn't too loud, but a lower level would've been welcome, esp. if on a date or part of a group.  Make sure to check out the aquarium full of colorful fish!  Nice touch!

I had planned to have Thai this past Tuesday (10/28) when I met an acquaintance at work who told me he'd been inundated with phone calls all day from friends and relatives wishing him an Indian "Happy New Year."  (10/29- time in India is 12 hours ahead.)  Since I had wanted Indian cuisine for some time, I decided I'd hold off on having Thai and go for Indian that night.  I first thought of going to Royal Taj on Broadway, but I wasn't looking forward to the slow service.  I've wanted to try Taj Mahal ever since a coworker told me how good the samosas were there, though she had admitted that she's never had samosas before.  I figured what better time to try a new Indian restaurant than on their New Year!  I noticed one other couple besides me that night, and they were waiting for their entrees.  I greeted the host Jimmy, who turned out to be one of three siblings that ran the restaurant.  He was very welcoming, and we exchanged "Happy Divalis" as he led me to my table.  I liked the subtle lighting in the main dining area, where most of the light came modern Indian music videos displayed on TV.  I thought the yellow curtain upon which a silver-studded likeness of the Taj Mahal served as a nice alternative to a regular door- this apparently led to the restrooms, which I wouldn't find out until the next day, when I took my Mom to have dinner there again.  I decided on having an app for dinner- samosa with channa chat: a crisp vegetable patty consisting of potatoes and peas with channa masala, a dish made with chickpeas/garbanzo beans, onions, tomatoes, garlic, garam masala, cilantro, and spices (turmeric, cumin, peppers, and coriander, to name a few).  Waiting for my entree, I munched on a papadum with chutneys of mint and tamarind and chatted with the couple next to me, who expounded the details of the celebration of Divali, a winter harvest festival honoring the return of good Lord Ram from exile and his triumph over demon-king Ravan with fireworks, flowers, worship, and with sweets.  I chose to do my part in the celebration by having rasmalai and gulab jamun later on that night :D  I found the samosa quite delightful with the channa masala (aka chana or chole, as in chole bhature), but it would be equally delicious without the garnish.  For dessert, I couldn't decide between the gulab jamun, a favorite, made with homemade cheese cubes fried and swimming in sugar syrup and the rasmalai, also made of homemade cheese, but not fried, and cooked instead with condensed milk and rosewater sugar syrup sprinkled with crushed pistachios, so I had both!    Jimmy was very accomodating as I asked my usual questions regarding my food allergies, and he happily obliged me with the details of their lunch buffets- from 11a to 2:30p, $8, each day with differing 5 veggie entrees, 3 meat entrees, 2 breads (plus your choice of plain or garlic naan, which is served to you at the table), basmati rice, a dessert, and the usual accompaniment of 4 or 5 chutneys.  If menu options do not satisfy you, the kitchen staff will gladly oblige as long as your requests are of northern India origin- it is a Punjabi restaurant.  I enjoyed my experience here so much, I returned again with Mom the next night.  Mom was open to going there, not knowing much of Indian cuisine, bec. I had brought home keema naan (stuffed with minced lamb) which she enjoyed.  Since she and I like lamb, I ordered the lamb rogam josh, a tomato-based dish, curry-like, with onions, garlic, chilis, and spices.  I had hoped to speak with Jimmy to get his lamb suggestions, but as it turned out, he was busy helping out in the kitchen.  (He actually cooked our dish and remembered speaking of making the lamb jalfraize too late into the preparation of the rogan josh dish.)  $13 price tag didn't include rice, which was disappointing, since Udupi Cafe and other restaurants I've visited in the valley do, so I ordered garlic naan.    Again we were served papadum and chutneys while we waited for our food.  As usual, Mom thought everyone else's selections looked delicious as they were brought to their tables.  They certainly SOUNDED terrific- sizzling chicken tandoori and a salmon dish I cannot recall.  The dishes arrived, but Mom did not enjoy the samosa chana chat for she had found it too spicy (I thought it was perfect!).  It wasn't too late to alter the spice level of the lamb dish, which also did not appeal to her.  I found it to be good, if a little too gamey.  I only had a taste since the samosa app was very filling.  At least Mom enjoyed the wonderful garlic naan.  I will definitely be back to try the lunch buffet.

Took a friend to dinner here this past Tuesday.  It was his first visit at any Keg; I've only dined at the Chandler location.  I enjoyed our dinner and conversation, even though we elected to stay at the bar when we could've had our pick of tables and booths.  I had received an invite to enjoy dinner for two for $30 (choice of prime rib and sirloin, plus potato and veggies), but when we learned that we could opt to apply the savings (a $15.90 value) towards other selections, we decided to go w/ the server's suggestions of filet mignon w/ blue cheese mousse ($24.95; for me) and sirloin topped w/ roasted red pepper cream sauce and garnished w/ grilled asparagus, lobster, and scallops ($26.95; for him), both cooked to medium.  We were promptly served The Keg's awesome complimentary table bread and butter.  Love it!  After about a 20-minute wait, our entrees arrived, and boy, were they beautiful!  I wished I had taken photos!  (I promise to next time.)  While I loved my garlic-studded blue cheese mousse-topped bacon-wrapped filet mignon (Whew!  Try saying that fast three times!), w/ sweet potato fries instead of the standard loaded double-baked potato, it was my friend's roasted red pepper cream sauced sirloin that stole the show!  Apparently my friend enjoyed his meal, since the only things that remained on his plate were the potato skin and a couple pieces of soggy sweet potato fries (the kitchen made a mistake and switched our potato selections).  I will definitely order this dish again, and it'll have to be soon as the entree isn't even on the regular dining menu- it's a seasonal offering.    I really wanted to have a glass of wine, but decided against it as I had a long drive home to look forward to; However, it was a pleasant surprise to find out that The Keg offered Blue Moon on tap, and it was w/ pleasure to savor the few sips off of my friend's pilsner glass.  The Keg now offers happy hours, but only on drinks- no food specials :(

Nice atmosphere, but TFC (The Filipino Channel) on the tube set on VERY LOUD quickly ruins the good vibes for me.  I start to wonder what the non-Filipino customers think of the shows' quality, but then I recall Judge Judy, Montel, COPS, etc., that air on TV and I don't feel so embarrassed.  Food are set out buffet-style or "turo-turo" (you point at the food you want), and I quickly learn that the daily lunch specials' menu printed and displayed on an easel outdoors by the entrance doesn't accurately depict what you're going to find served indoors.  Friday's menu listed a dish that wasn't offered bec. apparently it was served the day before and another dish was offered in its place.  (Why even bother printing out a menu if you're not going to stick to it?  Guess I better call ahead before making the trip from Laveen.)  One dish stood out, and I asked the server if it contained any meat, to w/c he replied just "ginataang kalabasa" (aka squash simmered in coconut milk).  I was starving, and aside from the "bistek" (pan-fried slices of beef steak) and "pritong tilapia at galungong" (fried tilapia and scad), nothing much interested me here.  So for my lunch combo, I chose fried tilapia and rice w/ squash, green beans, and okra simmered in coconut milk for my veggies.    I was having a good time eating my lunch until I noticed that there were shrimp (allergy) in the squash dish... The server apparently was not aware it had meat in it, could not verify if it was shrimp, and had to ask the owner/cook to confirm.  I thought this an unacceptable practice; it's a good thing for him that I am not a vegetarian, and a very good thing for the venue's cook/owner that I am not deathly allergic to shrimp, at least not yet.  The owner/cook gladly replaced the squash dish for beef steak (w/c tasted fine, albeit salty and VERY greasy), although my original buffet server was not pleased.  This irked me- what does it matter to him that she replaced a dish bec, he was negligent of the original's ingredients?  Perhaps he felt embarrassed that he couldn't even tell there was shrimp in it, but why show discontent?  Oh, he really made my blood boil!    I'll try to visit again to try other lunch specials and see if the service improves.  Otherwise, I may just spend my money at Jeepney Bistro and Lumpia Factory down the road (where my eardrums won't be tormented by untalented comics on "Wowowee").  I do have one positive thing to say about Gingerroot- its rice was whiter, fluffier, and better in quality than that of Lumpia Factory, w/c was yellowed, drier, and just plain sorry-looking enough for me not to take home to re-hash in "sinangag" (rice fried with garlic... yum!).  I do hope that the dinner service and menu are several times' better than that of lunch... Menu prices made me laugh... Gingerroot's ambience definitely places it at the top of the list of all the other Filipino venues in Chandler if you're on a date, but I'd very much dislike the experience if I'm forced to listen and watch TFC and have buffet food at those prices!

To say that I'm a fan is putting it mildly.  I've visited this cafe three times in the last two weeks.  That's 66 miles RT per visit just so that I can take home a half a pound assortment of truffles, and they're expensive treats at $38 per pound.  Love the ice cream and chocolate bars, too.   Two negative points: 1.) It's hard to get a sample of the truffles.  Easier to sample the ice cream, but it's hard to relish the essences of the products with how little they offer- not even half of the tip of my pinky finger (and I have petite hands).  Offering samples leads to higher sales, yes?  2.) The upholstery needs a lot of attention. Please either maintain cleanliness more often, or switch to a user-friendly fabric.

9/18  Checked out their happy hour- select apps $2.95 each!  However, no specials on the alcoholic beverages, with a quick glance at the wines-by-the-glass revealing prices of about $9 and up.  Thank goodness Total Wine and More was holding its grand opening (w/ a penny wine-tasting!) that day... Violeta and I decided to try a few apps here and then head straight to Total Wine for the liquid component :)  I should make a correction to the last statement above- it was I that tried a few apps- the Sliced steak brushetta and the Brio brushetta quattro," while Violeta H. tried the Margherita flatbread.  My apps were both outstanding!  I could probably be satisfied w/ two orders of the steak brushetta (loved that Tuscan Italian dressing!), while an order of the brushetta quattro would suffice (it's their burger, quartered, and a side of homemade potato chips).  While I had my hands full w/ the two apps AND their great sourdough table bread (there were also some great-looking seeded crackers/flatbread, too, but I couldn't try it due to food allergies), Violeta confided that she loved her Margherita flatbread.    Brio Tuscan Grille's happy hour, despite the lack of discounted beverages, provides impressive hors d'oeuvres at exceptional value.  I'll definitely visit again =)

11/25/11  Saw "Arthur Christmas" w/ the family today (great animation, funny, and very entertaining!).  Really liked the space of the room: multi-tiered, nice leg room, movable arm rests.    A few tips:  1. For those who like to order fountain drinks, the concession stands offer free refills when you purchase large-sized cups.  2. All shows before 3:55p are $5 per child and $7.50 for adults and seniors.  3. Just for the holidays, every $25 gift card purchase earns you a $5 gift card reward.

8/01 Green curry w/ Tofu off of the lunch menu.  Soup was tasty, and curry dish arrived soon after.  Was satisfied with the dish, but it did not hold a candle to the green curry I had at the Phoenix location, or to any of the other restaurants I've had it, for that matter.  Enjoyed the tofu; it was the curry sauce that wasn't as great as the one I adored at the Phoenix branch.  One more thing, why add corn to the eggroll filling??  Not authentic.      May try other lunch items at a later date, but I think I'll just go to the Adams St. location, instead.  Tastier selections there, and better service too!

8/16/13  Great pizza place in sister's neighborhood!    My first visit here was a day shy of two years ago- I found a pic on my laptop of a Margherita pizza from here dated 8/17/11.  I remember thinking the pizza and calamari were great, and my spaghetti-loving sister enjoyed her selection, as well...  Tonight, we ordered drafts of YuengLing (BIL) and Honey Brown (moi), a bottle of Corona (with a lime wedge; sis), and waters all around.  Our server Blair was kind enough to let me sample the Waterkeeper Hefeweizen (one of two specials on tap) and the HB http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=XQX6OCUnFv9MacOAbwS-EQ#XQX6OCUnFv9MacOAbwS-EQ before I ordered a pint.  BIL ordered the other draft special, Dale's pale ale, but he didn't like it, so sis asked if he could switch it out for another.  No prob.  For food, we chose the calamari to start, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=69xy3Q3NjSUTRomDOgDj4w#69xy3Q3NjSUTRomDOgDj4w and an 18" half-Elizabeth Special and half-Hawthorne's Special White, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=1kmEdfAxtM0pjzYTyJHDMQ#1kmEdfAxtM0pjzYTyJHDMQ while nephew wanted the cheese pizza. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=lJE9Ugy6CD9wFH-b92flcg#lJE9Ugy6CD9wFH-b92flcg  While I can't speak for my sister and BIL's usual pizza pick (Italian sausage, pepperoni, 'shrooms, green bell, white onions, mozz), sister and I LOVED the HSW, which had ricotta cream sauce, mozz, (lotsa!) pesto, and sundried tomatoes.  I really appreciated the thin crusts served here. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=iSE_JGbw3nZ0Ks3CXN60Cg#iSE_JGbw3nZ0Ks3CXN60Cg  Sister already decided this combo is what they're ordering on their next visit.  A great meal out almost always ends with something sweet, and I love tiramisu, so this was a must-try. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=xGX1CO0Jfnq4qwe_WitiYg#xGX1CO0Jfnq4qwe_WitiYg  Sis ordered a slice of chocolate cake for my nephew. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=fIgdOPFPCcLTquIoSyJzGQ#fIgdOPFPCcLTquIoSyJzGQ  They were BOTH absolutely amazing!  I like tiramisu that is rich in flavor-sweet mascarpone, but not cloyingly so, and rich espresso taste, no greasy mouth-feel, and not too light and fluffy, and this was perfect!  (I asked for the powdered sugar to be omitted.)  The chocolate cake is also a must-have!  It was a lot denser than the tiramisu-- almost flourless in texture, or at least the part I ate from was (the outer edge of the cake).  Too bad the busser threw out our take-out containers of sweet treats... They're pricey!  (Tiramisu was almost $6, and the chocolate cake was $8, but come to think of it, the cake slice was huge.)  I even labeled and dated them, but not even two minutes had passed when I thought I'd forgotten my phone and ran in to retrieve it, and our table had already been cleared, and the busser didn't even bat an eye.  We didn't notice that the desserts were missing until we were home.    Make sure you check the tab for accuracy!!  p.s.  The Honey Brown lived up to its name, and I definitely preferred it after sampling the bitter hef, but the beer kept impressing me as I ate the calamari (awesome combo) and then progressed to the pizza.  I had my sister try the beer after each course, and she concurred.  I would order this again in the future!

Always wanted to experience a massage or treatment here, but even with the 30% off sales, it's still too costly for me- even during Christmas holidays when there's BOGO sales.  (I pay $50 for weekly 90 minutes with an LMT at SWIHA, who takes a cut from the service cost, and I tip an extra $20 for a great session-- yes, I invest more than $3300 annually for weekly massages, plus I treat family and friends to massages every year, as well, so I'm not miserly.  I will pay for great service with great value!)  It is strongly suggested that the LMTS are tipped 18% on a service's full price here at HES, so you will see just how much I'm saving at SWIHA**.  I finally visited for the first time a few days ago, because I received an email blast that HES was selling off their remaining Malie Organics body and home products, which HES has used for many years.  I recently arrived back from a vacation in Oahu and left with a 7.5 oz Pikake-scented body cream, which cost me $32 (orig. price).  I was happy to hear about the sales, since I would be able to stock up on more body cream (I wanted Pikake, Mango nectar, and Koke' e), as well as buy the respective $28 hand soap gels at 30% off (HES members, who pay a monthly fee, get 35% off).  Alas, there were only a few items left to purchase, most of which were home fragrances, such as diffusers and room fresheners.  For body/beauty items, there were $30 10 mL perfume oils and some body cleansers.  I left with two perfume oils in Mango Nectar and Koke'e (still a hefty $45 with the discount).    The front, with the cashier/desk and merchandise stations, felt very cramped.  I saw an office next to the cashier/desk that looked disorganized, with paperwork and cardboard boxes.  I spied a narrow corridor lined with doors that had name plaques on them.  I can only assume that the showers and other amenities that could warrant the exorbitant prices here are somewhere in the back, but I didn't get that exclusive feeling as I shopped in that cramped front room, so I don't think I would come back to try any of their services here.  Maybe the Chandler location is bigger?  I may check it out the next time an email blast notifies me of sales.  Oh, and lastly, when I asked about whether there were more Malie in stock, I was told that all they had was what was out on display.  I didn't get the warm fuzzy feelings I'd get from other sales people trying to make a sale, or get you to come back, be it at touristy Oahu, or more locally here in the valley.  Just the standard welcome greeting when you walk in.  I actually felt like I was intruding, as I looked over their products.  And this after my saying that I just returned from Oahu a few days before.  No "how was your visit," or any other friendly interactions.  So easy to cash in on the buzz I was still feeling from vacation.  I actually wish I could return the items I purchased, now that I'm writing this all down!  Be sure to check the receipt when you sign...  I was handed a ticket for the previous customer who rang up with a discount on a $`107 service.  It might've even been to my benefit, but it wasn't the right ticket showing my fragrance purchase, so I wanted the correct one.  Why?  I don't know, since I won't be able to return themSee, another reason why I didn't enjoy my experience here.  **When I first visited Oahu in 2011, I went for a massage at a spa at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, which accepted Spa Finder gift certificates.  While the $200+ one-hour service, not including tip that cost me $40 for a service that is short 30 minutes of my usual, was enjoyable, it wasn't anything different as that I would get from my top favorite therapist at SWIHA at the time.  Not even the ambience, extra amenities, and the friendly conversation during the massage, of which I usually prefer silence for a more relaxing and meditative session, made up for the higher cost.

5/31/13  Finally stopped in for my first time visit to order takeout.  Since it was my first time, I wanted to check out the menu board overhead, but staring up at menu boards while people are waiting to take my order has never been my cup o' tea, so I looked around for a leaflet to peruse through, instead.  I liked the open layout of the grill and kitchen, as i was able to see the cooks in action.  I read under "Habanero Specialties" a listing for Chiles rellenos, a roasted poblano chile stuffed with jack cheese combo (rice, choice of beans-refried or black, choice of tortillas (corn, wheat, or flour) and pico de gallo for $9, and I'm a cheese-lover, so I had to try this. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=GtRJBN7OK6Vhu6x-zgZgrA#GtRJBN7OK6Vhu6x-zgZgrA  Looking around for a meaty meal, I saw under "Parrillada," that I could get a four-meat combo http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=GtRJBN7OK6Vhu6x-zgZgrA#vd5i45jyypKwClT1WigsnQ (grilled steak and chicken, chorizo, and carnitas, with rice, choice of beans, choice of tortilla, guacamole, and sour cream for one person, $11, but I also noticed that diners could add shrimp to their meals, so I wondered if the red meats were grilled alongside the shrimp (I'm allergic to shellfish), or perhaps there is a designated area where shrimp are partitioned away from the other meats, and looking past the order-taker's shoulder, I could see that shrimp are indeed cooked on the same grill with the meats.  I told the order-taker that I would like to try some of their barbecue, but I can't if the meats are cooked in the same area as the shrimp, since I have a shrimp allergy, and she fired off a few sentences in Spanish to the cook, who replied with a few sentences of his own, after which she turned to me and said that my meats would be prepared in a separate pan.  Sweet!!  While my orders were cooking, I surveyed the place and observed that while the resto is small, it didn't FEEL small, because of all the flourishes that gave the place a bigger presence (wooden furnishings and counters, a mini-bar with a handful of Mexican beer pumps, a small fridge stocked with bottles of Mexican beer if you don't want to order drafts, a counter in front of the grills where you may dine, or sit and sip on a pint of beer while you wait for your takeout (which is what one guy did while I paid for my order and waited it out on one of the dining tables).  There's even patio seating, should you choose to dine alfresco, or if you don't want to leave the restaurant smelling like you spent all day cooking in the kitchen!  Both dishes were muy delicioso!  Since I had two entrees, I decided to try both bean choices (refried and black), as well as two tortilla choices (wheat and flour), and they were all very good!  The black beans were soft and tender- I was expecting something like biting into boiled lima or kidney beans, but the black beans were softer, more akin to firm, spring peas (not mushy!).  I also appreciated that both bean choices weren't very salty and tasted freshly-prepared and sprinkled with cotija cheese, not from cans and doctored over the stove.  The chile relleno batter tasted decidedly eggy, which I did not mind, but if you don't like your foods eggy, then you might want to stay away from this dish.  I usually try to avoid tomatoes (inflammatory), but the pico de gallo smelled so bright and flavorful that I couldn't resist, and I'm glad I didn't, for it complemented the cheesy relleno perfectly!  As for the barbecue meats, I liked them all, even the spicy chorizo!  I'd say the grilled steak was my fave, followed by the diabolical chorizo, which also came with similarly-seasoned, grilled cubed potatoes.  (I didn't mind the spice level of the chorizo while the meal was fresh, but I noticed that it tasted too salty and too spicy for me to tolerate subsequent leftover meals- strange, that.)  While I enjoyed the grilled chicken (I try to avoid anything corn-based, since I'm allergic to corn, and yes, that would also include eggs... one or two in a batter is OK for me on most days), I wondered if I could order my next barbecue combo sans chicken and with more grilled steak, instead?  Doesn't hurt to ask...  I returned the next night for another installment, since Mom finished the chile relleno leftovers soon after I arrived home with them.  Would love to go back and dine-in one of these days, and perhaps enjoy a complementing beverage and dessert with my meal!  :)  Mmm... happy hour menu sounds delightful, too! http://www.habaneros.mx/Happy_Hour.html

I had heard of this bakery from a competitor who holds shop in Chandler.  I have fond memories of delicious cakes from Red Ribbon from birthday parties of years past back home.   Filipinos LOVE to throw a party, and I swear cakes from Red Ribbon were always present.  You can imagine the nostalgia that swept over me, then, when I finally found this bakeshop situated near the food court in Arizona Mills.  The shop looked so pretty- all lit up and all these enticing baked goods wrapped in plastic/cellophane with candy-red printing.  (Hmm... an alarm went off in my head after seeing them all wrapped up.)  The shop looked very clean, with welcoming tables and chairs, and my, how lovely those cake rolls look in the case!  Imagine, then, my disappointment upon reading the nutrition info on these plastic-wrapped goods to find that most, if not all, items are made with margarine, not butter.  These baked goods failed the "farm vs. factory" test- ingredients listed sound more like they're mechanically-produced in a factory rather than being all-natural, such as "flour, eggs, butter, milk," etc.  Before sampling what I must admit was a delicious morsel of mocha crunch cake, I asked if the frosting contained powdered sugar.  The sales clerk looked at his coworker, whom I assumed is a manager, who looked at him, then looked at me, and then said "We think it's whipped cream."  Think??  How can you not know what ingredients are used in the products you sell?  I also inquired if any items are made on-site.  No, he said.  Everything is shipped/trucked in, and the only preparations done at the bakeshop are the frying- the FRYING- of the empanadas and the re-heating of the siopao and noodle dishes.    Sorry Red Ribbon, but this Filipina only wants goods baked with butter, not margarine.  I said BAKED, not fried.  With the exception of the pie shell used in the egg pie, all of the pastries served at Manila Bakery are made on-site, so you won't find preservatives listed in the ingredients, as well.    My fond memories of those cakes will have to be just that, memories.  All the better when it comes to those twice-daily weigh-ins...

Situated in the same plaza as the Asian supermarket Lee Lee, Manila Bakery serves great pan de sal hot from the oven!!  Fresh-baked everyday, all day!  They're even topped with breadcrumbs... just like they do back home (Philippines).  Other must-tries:  pan de coco, hopia mongo egg pie, cassava cake chicken empanada  The bakery sells other items, such as pork empanada, hopia baboy, mamon, ensaymada (classic pastry adapted by the Filipinos from the Spaniards), ube halaya, and turon; some I'm tried, and others I haven't (due to food allergies).  BTW, don't be shy about asking them to pop one or more of the pastries (or empanadas) in the oven to enjoy at the store or as you walk out- they'll be more than happy to oblige you.  (Unfortunately, there is only one table inside the store- good for 5, maybe 6.  There is room for one or two more tables, though, so maybe the owner/baker/cashier and family members will be inspired to add in the future.  Would be nice to have some outside when the weather's nice.)  The bakery does not have a credit card machine just yet.  This babv's brand-spanking-new!

The ambience is a feast for the eyes and for the touch, this much is true, but one is paying a very high price for this exclusivity.  While I liked waiting in the lobby- couldn't sit at the sushi counter until it was open for dinner service at 5:30p- I did notice that for a venue that strives to project a life of luxury, housekeeping hadn't come by to clean food debris off of the coffee table (closest to the sushi restaurant's host desk).  Not even when a rep came by to alert me to a bar menu sitting on the table and asked me if I had wanted anything from the bar- she had to have noticed the mess?! I ordered a $9.50 spider roll (soft-shelled crab), a $10 veggie tempura app, and a $19 baked lobster roll, all priced at 50% for one week during their 1-year anniversary.  They're all good, and factoring in the ostentatious surroundings, I'd pay $9.50 for the soft-shelled crab roll, but I'd put my foot down on the other two.  50% maybe, but $19 for a five-piece lobster roll?  Yes, it was very tasty, and yes, the cream sauce was orgasmic, but for $19, I expect moments from the restaurant scenes of "The Ugly Truth" or "When Harry Met Sally," take your pick. If you've money to burn or have someone else paying for the bill, then this is your sushi stop near Old Town Scottsdale.

Not very many sushi restaurants hold happy hours (my top two faves, Sakana and Kyoto, do not), and those that do usually disappoint (w/ the exception of Tempe's Sushi 101- please read my review!).  When I read, and heard, that Pan Asia offered happy hour, I couldn't wait for my short day at work, Tuesday, to roll (pun intended!) around so that I may go check it out.  It is with displeasure that I am only able to rate my experience there with 2 stars.  Firstly, the happy hour menu (select apps for 1/2 off) is very limited:  Crispy spring rolls; normally 2 pcs $3 Crispy crab puffs (this should really read "krab puffs"); 6 pcs $4  Chicken pot stickers; 6 pcs $5 Spicy chicken wings; 6 pcs $6     (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kWkW6vVePpBox_fKfGgPjQ?select=YH81hCqvvD4-1rzU6VSEJQ)  (Also, $1.50 off wine and beer selections.)  Secondly, after reading the HH menu, I had to wonder if I was actually at a sushi bar and not sitting at a Chinese-southwestern joint.  I mean, where are the $2-$4 nigiri and sushi roll selections??  After glancing at the "Tofu and Vegetable" menu and spotting a couple of delicious-sounding veggie items (such as Garlic sauteed asparagus), I said to my server/bartender that it was a shame that PA didn't offer vegetable tempura as a HH selection.  She said that they're still working on it.    After food allergies (spring rolls, pot stickers) and personal preference (only eat real crab, not imitation), I chose the spicy chicken wings app (3 pcs $3) and a spider roll ($10).  If I had a chance to do it all over again, I would pass on the wings.  I guess I was expecting delicious crispy-fried Chinese chicken wings.  Yes, I knew it would be more like buffalo wings (the menu did say "spicy"), but I guess I was secretly hoping for wings you'd normally find on traditional Chinese menus.  Also, buffalo wings and spider rolls really don't go well together (which is why I found the HH menu so baffling!)    As for the spider roll- I liked the soft-shelled crab. Thick-battered, perhaps a tad too much, nicely-seasoned, and definitely made me think I was getting a good-sized portion of crab meat.  (I was hesitant in ordering a 5-pc. spider roll at $10 a pop, and when I saw the product, I didn't feel half-as-bad.)  Aside from the lackluster rice (I'm not kidding, the rice had ZERO flavor- just sticky, white rice), the roll was alright.  It's nice to know that the chefs are willing to work around my allergies, but I don't know if I'll be visiting anytime soon... a sushi restaurant must offer great-tasting sushi rice.  After all, sushi is Japanese for "vinegared rice."  So, I implore the owners and chefs to please improve upon the flavor of the sushi rice!  Only then will I come back to try the rest of your sushi offerings, especially those under the "Special Sushi, Sashimi & Roll Combo" menu.

Went straight from work to check out Mekong Plaza last night after chatting with coworker "JJ" about the good deals she found there.  She was able to find her fave brand of rice, grapes, garlic, and other items.  She was lamenting that she only had twenty minutes to look around; she therefore allowed herself to buy those items she knew cost less here than at Lee Lee.  After she'd listed off what she had paid $53 for, I told her she should count her blessings that she only had those few minutes to shop!  I asked her if she preferred it over Lee Lee, and while she liked the newness of the place and the lower costs of some items, she didn't like how items in the produce section were plastic-wrapped; she liked being able to hand-pick her veggies and fruits.  Another coworker had mentioned the plaza's opening to me days prior and had piqued my interest the moment she uttered the words, "there are five restaurants..."  I was getting hungry while JJ and I chatted, so there was no question where I was heading to after clocking out.  As I pulled into the almost empty parking lot at around 8:20p, I noticed that the entrance doors were flagged by two restaurants- one called MyLynn Cafe that was still open for business, and the other looked like a coffee shop that was already closed for the day.  I grabbed a menu from MyLynn (beverages that included fountain, coffee, and smoothies, $5 or less, and a page of chef's specials of about 8 or so items, soups mostly, $5-10) intending to stop here after my pit stop at the grocery.  This building is HUGE!  I saw white everywhere I looked- floors, statues, and walls.  Most lots (indoor shops) were still unoccupied, and I was beginning to think I may never find the grocery store as all I could see where closed shops (dentistry, jewelry store, a movie rental shop, etc) and more restaurants.  When coworkers mentioned there were a few eateries in place, I expected to encounter a layout similar to that of Whole Food's (Ray/101), so this building really threw me for a loop- walking around MP actually felt like I was perusing through one of the mini-malls back home (Philippines).  Thinking it over just now, I also remember malls in NJ that had similar layouts.  But I digress... I spotted two "opening soon" food-court type sections for Korean and Japanese food before turning the corner and finding two more Vietnamese restaurants (Vietnamese Restaurant and Un-pho-gettable).  These venues stood right across from the grocery store.  Finally, I reached my destination!  Before investigating the grocery, I entered Un-pho-gettable and skimmed through their extensive menu and saw the entree prices ranged from around $8 to $20 or more.  I asked a person who seemed like the manager what time they closed.  He replied usually 8p, but if it's busy then they would close at 8:30p.  I told him that if they were still open, I would return shortly.  A quick glance around MP revealed large seafood, meats, and refrigerated sections (not counting those refrigerated aisles that wrapped around the back of the store).  Indeed, these three departments occupied a third of the grocery.  Don't quote me on this, but I think that the produce department was also a part of that section, but I wasn't looking for fruits or veggies that night.  I was on the hunt for the Filipino aisle, specifically for brands of peanut butter other than Lily's, which is the only brand to be found at Lee Lee.  Unfortunately, I only found the one brand, which is $0.20 less here.  I did, however, find PRESERVATIVE-FREE jackfruit and macapuno ("coconut sport") strings (two delicious components of a nectarous icy snack/beverage called halo-halo).    To keep this review from tiring the both of us, I will wrap it up by saying that I will definitely be back to have another longer look around the aisles, which did not seem as country-specific as Lee Lee's.  It does reverberate highly with me already bec. I found those last two items.  What else would I find??  I'm brimming with anticipation!    BTW, since the pho place was already closed by 8:40p,  I decided to try the one next door, which had a Vietnamese title and ended with "Vietnamese Restaurant.  Review will be posted shortly.

On my first visit here, I ordered #27, which was charbroiled beef, shredded pork, steamed egg, and rice.  The charbroiled beef is EXCELLENT- slightly sweet, smoky, and salty; it reminded me of the skewers of barbecued meat I'd eaten as a child in Manila (Philippines).  The shredded pork was ok, but not something I'd order again.  The steamed egg was delicious!  So good, in fact, that I KNEW it had to be bad for me.  Sure enough, I spied something that looked like it might be finely sliced mushrooms.  Indeed, the ingredient was dried mushroom.  So, so tasty, but I soon felt vertigo (a food allergy symptom).  The texture of the rice was also very nice.  Very satisfying meal, save the vertigo and the pain that came afterward from the mushroom** :(  One thing I am not looking forward to when dining here is that most of the staff do not speak or understand English.  Be sure to look for a short-haired middle-aged woman or a young man in his late teens or early 20's w/ short black hair behind the cash register (I specify only bec. there are many young men with long-ish hair w/ highlights running around).  They can speak and understand English.  The young man is the son of the owners, and he is able to translate your questions to the kitchen staff if he doesn't know the answers himself.  You may order items to go.  I definitely recommend the charbroiled beef* (one pound costs $9.50 plus tax) and the deep-fried cornish hen ($5).  Oh my, the cornish hen!!  So delectable, so juicy, so garlicky!!  It comes with extra broth on the side, but you really don't need the broth.  Be sure to try the Che 3 mau- the Vietnamese version of Filipino Halo-halo.  While halo-halo has many ingredients, including red mung beans, coconut sport strings, ube, jackfruit, leche flan, cooked plantain, palm fruit gel, and tapioca pearls (many combos exist, depending on what you feel like having), Com Tam's che 3 mau has only two types of beans, crunchy red bean and creamy yellow mung, and green jelly strings (for added texture), and the belle-of-the-ball coconut milk over grated ice.  I order it sans green jelly strings (extra mung beans, please!).  TO DIE FOR!  What makes the icy dessert beverage so great is the yellow mung bean!  You definitely must try this refreshing drink!  (*I've ordered the beef to go twice, and both times I'm blown away by the flavor and texture of the beef!  However, please note that it's best to let the meat rest for a few minutes before digging in.  Otherwise, you'll end up with a lot of sinewy pieces that will end up in the trash, not in your belly.  Better yet, refrigerate and eat the beef COLD- you can have it over hot rice.  Just trust me.  Ok, don't trust me, and re-heat those babies.  You'll kick yourself later.)  BTW, the restaurant gets its name from the specialty it serves, Com Tam (broken rice, which I could figure out from the myriad selections that begin with "Com tam") and Thuan Kieu, which I was told was a generic name, sort of like John Smith (sounds like "thank you" but take away the "h" sound and say it more like "ten" with a "k" in the end- tenk you).  Thank you Com Tam Thuan Kieu!!

3/29/10  Came here after work as Mom needed to do some light shopping at Mekong supermarket.  Since it was already 815p, she started grocery-shopping, while I placed an order for spring rolls, which Mom specially-requested, and a combination pho.  I've always wondered if the meatball dish was any good, so I ordered that, too.  In less than 10 minutes, our dishes were ready, so I texted Mom to come on over.  Mom didn't really enjoy the fresh rolls- she only had half of one, and the other sat in the fridge for three days until I tossed it out.  We also didn't enjoy the meatball platter.  What a waste!  Terrible presentation (unflattering color- could've used some searing action to give the slices a nice crust), horrid texture (clammy/rubbery), and very bland in flavor.  Two bites, and I wondered who would ever order this again?  Not us!  Thankfully, the pho saved the evening!  That is, until it became quite clear, from the heightened energy levels of the cleaning crew, that they were anxious to close for the evening.  We were trying to eat as fast as we could, until I finally looked at my watch and noted it was only 8:45p!  What the...?  Then I remembered that the last time we were there, we were treated the same way, too, but it was understandable, since it was closer to 9p then.  Sorry, Com Tam, but lackluster spring rolls, ghastly meatball dish, and rushing us when there was still plenty of time are two reasons too many not to come back!

11/16/10  Come here only for the margaritas!  And maybe the flan.    We almost turned away, bec. Mom doesn't like "hole in the wall" places.  She's no food snob, but she does appreciate pretty spaces, and this place wasn't.  But we weren't here for the ambience-- we were here solely bec. a couple of my Charlotte Yelp friends recommended it!  Thank goodness my nephew was around; For some reason, he has this grounding effect on our Mom, and she rarely makes a fuss where we go, as long as he's there.  :)  (Thinking back, though, I don't think I'd like to take my nephew back to this part of town-- a bit seedy, and this was around 1p!)  First order of business: un frozen margarita ($5), por favor!  Second order of business, nos dan tortillas con salsa y guacamole (gratis), por favor!  Actually, give THEM some chips, I'll just take a few sips of the marg...  Nephew wanted a cheese quesadilla ($5.99); sis wanted a combo plate-- a chicken taco and a beef enchilada ($7.49), con arroz y frijoles refritos; and I one of those lovely-looking tortas Milanesa ($7.99) con pastor (seasoned grilled pork).  The margarita was good.  As usual, Mom and sis filled up on the free chips and salsa...  I heard that the cheese crisp was OK, too.  It was better-received than the taco/enchilada combo.  I don't think she finished any of it!  My torta looked good, but one bite of the bread and my hopes of a fantastic sandwich thrill went south of the border!  Having looked at prior food shots from other TA reviews, I was expecting this crusty telera bread w/ a soft interior, but no way, Jose!  No crispiness anywhere- just a soft roll.  Another proof that the photos here are deceiving (including the ones I've posted)- the meat portion was sorely lacking.  It's as if they stuff just enough meat in the center so that, when sliced, a cool food shot can be taken!  "Donde el res?!?!"  ("Where's the beef?!?!")  Ayayay, pero there was the yummy flan, which we all thought was pretty good, considering Mom and I make some mean flan ourselves!  Three Amigos' flan even looks like the ones our Mom used to crave for when she was pregnant w/ me-- slightly overcooked, w/ air pockets, and the edges crisped just so.  (Hmm... was I describing myself, or the flan?  LOL)  Well, this one had the air pockets.  The edges were of a firmer texture, and as we progressed to the center, it became slightly creamier.    We may come back for another margarita and more flan, but not anytime soon.

For my 2nd Yelp Eats dinner, I headed to Metro Brasserie last Wednesday, 7/22.  Excluding a slight hiccup with the moules frites (I originally intended to order the scallops for my second course, but the server sold me on their "best in the valley" dish), I'd rate the food here with 5 stars!  But I'm getting ahead of myself...  Setting was nice, if a little disconcerting with the two kitchens to the left of the entry way, the L-shaped dining area, culminating with the bar-counter and its TVs and more bistro tables and chairs to the right.  On my way out, I did think it cool to be able to stand outside and watch the chefs work their magic.  For my 1st course, I ordered the Alsacian onion tart.  AMAZING!  Loved the thin-crust presentation, with caramelized onions, crispy smoked bacon, and gruyere cheese.  Not only was this tart so tasty and so beautiful to look at, but the proportions were ample; this appetiizer could easily feed at least three people (and I don't just mean those in the petite population, either) who plan to order entrees.  (I could get away with eating two of the six pieces with a side salad and leave satiated, and very happy with leftovers, but I'd be doing a HUGE disservice suggesting that you leave w/out having tried dessert!)  As I mentioned, my server, who was efficient, yet friendly, and who answered all my questions with grace and no trace of impatience, suggested I'd go with the moules frites, instead of the scallops I'd wanted.  While waiting for the moules frites to arrive, I chatted with an older couple sitting next to me, who were nice enough to offer a taste of their onion soup (I gracefully declined).  When my entree arrived, I offered them a few mussels to taste, and with some prodding from his date, the man tried one.  His reaction?  "A little sandy, but good."  Fortunately, the server was passing by and witnessed my sharing moules with my neighbor, so he'd asked him what he thought, to which I added that I haven't found any with sand, yet.  It took me about five pieces before I found some with sand.  After that, it seemed that they all were sandy, and I just didn't feel like eating any more (which is a shame because I loved the flavor, the generous portion, and I especially loved sipping on the broth).  Speaking of the broth, it was suggested I try dipping the frites in it.  Let me just say that as soon as I had a glimpse of the frites (fries), I knew I wouldn't enjoy them.  These fries were so greasy, they weren't crispy AT ALL, but perhaps these are how bistro frites are supposed to be?  So I tried a few.  To the server's credit, the broth did wonders to the frites, but I can't make myself eat soggy, spongy-with-grease fries, so I won't be having these when I return (and I do plan on returning, since the food that followed were very, very good!)  I was fortunate enough to be able to select another item for my 2nd course, and even though the server suggested I not go with the scallops being that my first seafood selection was a disappointment, I went with them, anyway.  Am I glad I did!  Three huge pieces, beautifully presented with baby turnips, crunchy asparagus, delectable saucisson Basquaise (pan-fried sausage), with a tomato vinaigrette.  (I asked that the creamed corn be omitted.)  I ate the entire dish!  After mulling on which dessert to try for my 3rd course (all of them sounded fantastic!), I decided on the sticky toffee pudding, and was I ever so glad I ordered it!  I am embarrassed to admit that I finished this dish in about two minutes flat.  This toffee muffin came topped with pistachio gelato and was garnished with caramel and creme fraiche with a smattering of whole pistachios (the menu mentions blackberries, but I did not detect any),and it deserved to be savored slowly, which I attempted to, really I did.  I'd come back just to have this again (and try the others!).  Service was attentive and friendly, although I was a little put-off when the decanter containing the rest of the wine pour was taken away soon after the moules frites left the table.  A little strange, that.  I also didn't like exiting the restaurant to go to the restroom, which was akin to one you'd find in a state park, or a community college: basic metal stalls and no ambience, whatsoever.  It was very warm in there, too.   But the food!  Come to Metro Brasserie for scrumptious food!  I'm happy to report that Metro offers a rotating daily dinner for 2 (entree, 500 mL of wine, and beignets) for $42.  I cannot wait to return to try this feature, as well as lunch and breakfast!  *(I'm so glad most of my photos came out well- have I mentioned that I dislike dark restaurants?  I want to see my food!!)

10/15  Popped in for a late lunch constituting of an Alsatian onion tart and a glass of wine.  I stopped by during happy hour, which meant the tart was $7 (orig. $9), and $2 off glasses of wine.  Bartender Jimmy was kind enough to give me samples of two reds and a rose, before I decided on a Riesling, instead.  Enjoyed the generous pour, which was later added to when Jimmy accidently knocked the decanter down when we shook hands :)  The tart came out a little burnt, and the gruyere was replaced with a milder "fromage blanc," but overall, it still made for a very tasty lunch/dinner!  Photos will prove that I ate at least 5.5 slices.  Read my lips: I ATE THE WHOLE THING.  Happy hour apps menu include onion soup gratin, country pate, escargots, onion tart, and a frisee salad for about $2 less than standard menu.  $5 IPAs, $3 off wine cocktails (reg. $10), and $2 off glasses of wine.  (I'm sure there are discounts on drafts and bottles, too, but since I'm not a beer-drinker, I didn't make a special note of this.)  I hope more food will be added to the menu.  Sad news: the toffee sticky pudding has been omitted from the current menu, with no hope of it coming back again.  (Strange that, since Jimmy said it was a very popular dessert.)  The crowd this Monday afternoon was very thin (4:00'ish)- a couple of tables outside, and me at the bar.  A man sat at a table behind me waiting for his date, and another man who recently relocated from San Fran sat a couple of seats from me later on.  Looks like a decent wine list.  Another HH special- a complimentary cheese plate ($18 value) accompanies each bottle of wine ordered (prices range from $30 and up)!

I was shopping at Costco when I started to feel hungry reading the ingredients list on a two-pack of fresh 7-cheese tortellini I spotted in the refrigerated section and suddenly remembering that I needed to get rotisserie chicken for Mom.  I decided to hurry through the register and buy the non-perishable items and head over to Pasta Pomodoro (near the Chandler mall) to feast on a Mista side salad and an appetizer of roasted butternut squash ravioli with a toasted sage brown butter sauce (half-priced during happy hour!).  Imagine my surprise and disappointment to find that Pasta Pomodoro has left shop and is replaced by Nouveau Bistro.   I was still a little confused as to what had become of Pomodoro, and as I walked toward the entrance of NB a man, who turned out to be the manager Scott Stevens, met me outside and gave me a warm greeting.  I asked when did the old resto leave town, and he informed me not even two or three weeks, but he thought that he had some great food to offer at the new place.  Now I must admit that I was pretty disappointed I wouldn't be able to taste that wonderful mista salad (with glazed pecans, gorgonzola cheese, and the awesome balsamic vinaigrette) nor the delicious ravioli again (to be honest, all I was after was the toasty sage leaves that came with the butter sauce...), but I digress (and you knew I would, didn't you?).  Am I glad I gave NB a try!  There were a few appetizers that looked appealing, and after a few seconds vacillating between the grilled scallops and the roasted asparagus, the scallops won.  It came with the description of "jerk seared, with a tomatillo chipotle tartar sauce on top of cabbage slaw, red chili oil, and avocado."  As I was sipping on a glass of chardonnay, I looked over the surroundings and noted that other than the presence of a few cool paintings on the walls and easels, the resto looked like it did with the same tables and chairs, and even had the same register set up as the old Pomodoro.  I inquired as to when the grand opening would be, and Scott informed me that it would be somewhere around Nov. 14-15.    Many minutes went by as I listened in on some political chit-chat among the manager and staff.  I even met the "sort of" owner Charlie Seo, who told me he and his wife used to own and run the now closed Zest Spirited Dining in Phoenix.  Looking over Zest's menu online right now, I see that he had been telling me the truth when said that NB's menu offers many of Zest's selections (including the Shrimp and goat cheese melt, eggplant cheesecake, and the grilled scallops I was waiting for).  Being 5'-tall, hungry, and sipping on wine, I had to ask whether or not NB had complimentary bread for customers to nibble on, because I felt a little tipsy.  Thankfully, I was handed a few slices of delicious rosemary bread, which everyone should note are only brought to the table by request (I suggest you do!).    The scallops were fabulous!  The tomatillo chipotle tartar sauce was actually composed of two sauces, spicy red and creamy white, side by side.  Three jumbo scallops sat atop of the red sauce with a few toasted wonton triangles covered with glistening, but crunchy slaw that tasted heavenly with the creamy tartar sauce.  I REALLY wished I had thought of taking a photo of the dish.  I truly enjoyed the varying textures of this dish, and the rosemary bread came in handy as I enjoyed dipping it in the two sauces.  And yes, I know I'm a bit eccentric when it comes to bread- both Charlie and the server commented on the way I ate only the crust and left the soft bread on the plate.  I gave the soft bread a chance, Charlie, I really did, but I'm still a woman who loves crunchy foods... they help to relieve stress!  Even I'm getting tired of typing up this loonnnggg review (as I imagine you are in reading it), so I'll just end it by tipping my hat to Nouveau Bistro and its staff with those terrific grilled scallops, flavorful rosemary bread, and a slice of rich orange-cranberry cheesecake.  I will be back to try the Market seabass entree... the "spicy jack cream sauce" is calling my name!  P.S.  NB will also feature live jazz music starting at 6p towards the end of the week.  Management is still working out the details.  Charlie tried to make me hang around to experience the music tonight, but I had errands to attend to.  For those who'd like to try lunch here, NB is only open on Mondays (from 11a till closing).  Otherwise, it's dinner only.

Met a friend here for lunch on Friday, 4/17.  After striking out twice on our orders of Ahi tuna sandwich and Tortellini (the kitchen was out of ahi tuna, sweet potato fries, AND tortellini!), we decided to split the Citrus roasted chicken, which normally comes with "mashed potatoes and sauteed mixed vegetables with a wild mushroom demi-glace"- we opted for a lemon peppercorn sauce.    Thank goodness that customers are now served with delicious, and complimentary, table bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, for the entree did  take awhile to arrive.  No matter- we just asked for more bread!  This bread later served as the perfect accompaniment to the terrific lemon peppercorn sauce that came with the chicken dish.  I really enjoyed the sauteed mixed veggies.  Wished the veggie serving was larger since I couldn't partake in the consumption of the mashed potatoes, which my friend said was prepared the way she liked it- perfectly mashed with some chunks (it's also the way I used to enjoy my smashed potatoes!).

03/11/10  Had a fantastic breakfast today!!    After a meeting at work, I asked a couple of coworkers if they'd like to join me for breakfast.  One is a health nut like me, so I knew he'd be up for breakfast at TFK.  Thank goodness I'd mentioned for them to look for The Cheesecake Factory, or they'd never have found the place.  (BTW, what is up w/ the paid parking there these days?  It had been awhile since I'd been there last, and I was much relieved to find that two-hour parking is free w/ validation, or I'd have to stop dining at The Biltmore.)  After waiting a long while for them to arrive, I went ahead and placed my order for Wild Sockeye Salmon Lox since it didn't seem like my coworkers were going to make it (no contact #s and they weren't familiar w/ the area) and I either read breakfast hours wrong online, or the times had been extended (the website currently posts correct hours), and I wanted to have breakfast, not lunch!  While I waited for my food, said coworkers showed up and stood around not knowing what to order.  I suggested that one of them try the Quinoa Blueberry Johnny Cake, and he readily did when he noticed that ALL included ingredients were on his list of cholesterol-reducing foods!  The other wanted to see what organic eggs tasted like, so she had the Two Organic Eggs.  [I'll go easy on her... she's not a foodie! ;)]  The lox dish was a beauty, and it tasted even more exquisite! Generous portions of wild sockeye salmon sat on six charred grain bread (made in-house, and, as far as I could tell, indeed had many grains, as well as ribbons of thinly-sliced carrots), creamy labneh cheese (oh my!), and onions, plus sliced cherry tomatoes.  I practically inhaled this platter of food, it was so delectable!  I was almost finished w/ this selection when my coworker's johnnycakes arrived.  Yes, I said cakes-- the menu alluded to just the one.  His plate included three beautiful johnnycakes, with blueberries cooked within, as well as fresh blueberries added on top of a huge dollop of Greek yogurt and Maple Grove Farms' organic maple syrup (no need to reach into my purse for my own!  LOL).  He was gracious enough to let me sample, and so I did!  I was greedy enough to order my own plate of johnnycakes-- I ate all but half of a cake!  The other coworker hardly touched her breakfast.  Maybe she wasn't hungry.  Maybe she didn't like the taste of organic eggs?  Maybe, maybe.  03/23/10  Came back for more quinoa blueberry johnnycakes AND a take-out of savory Greek frittata!  As pictured, the open-faced omelet, which included organic eggs, slices of red onion, kalamata olives, tomato, feta, and oregano, didn't look appetizing, but don't believe your eyes!  This tasty selection was highly-satisfying, and I'm sure, given its chance to make its debut graced over a pristine plate, it would have made for some quality food porn!  ;)  Check out the portion size of accompanying grain bread!  Look closely, and you can spot some of those carrot strands I wrote about earlier...  I really must try dinner here someday, but only if I can secure that private room in the back.  It's too noisy out in the main dining room...

I stopped getting mani/pedis months ago (6 months or more) when the male manager mistreated me due to what I understood was his assumption that I worked for Yelp.  On that fateful day, my favorite nail tech, Tran, was busy with another customer, so he had offered to start on my nails, as they needed surface drilling/buffing to get the old gel polish off (I LOATHE using acetone nail remover, they leave my fingers very cold, and very dry.  Not to mention, my nail beds hurt the rest of the day.  Keep in mind that acetone is very easily absorbed through skin (nail tissue is another skin layer!), and enters the bloodstream and subsequently negatively affects the kidneys of both the technician's AND the customer's!  Frequent acetone use may and can lead to kidney damage!)  The manager asked me to take a seat at his station, and as I sat down, he also sat down and he reached over to grab the white towel that was already on the table and took it away.  He then placed a flyer down on the table in front of me, and wouldn't you know it, I saw that it was a large postcard with some sort with Yelp logo and advertising on it.  I asked him why he was using that instead of the towel, and he said nothing and did not offer any further explanation- he just asked for my hands.  I felt like he was being a bit rough as he cleaned my cuticles, poking the corners here and there, and almost cutting the skin too closely- just enough for it to hurt.  I asked him if he could be more gentle and careful.  It was when he applied too much pressure with the drill, to the point that I had to draw my hands back because my nail beds were painful from the heat and pressure that I told him "I do not work for Yelp, in case that is what you're thinking.  I only write reviews on Yelp, and I've been mistaken for working for Yelp before, so if you're mistreating me because Yelp is pressuring you to do something you don't want to, please don't take it out on me."  He said he didn't think I worked for Yelp... So I asked him again why then did he take the towel away and placed the Yelp postcard on the table to catch nail and cuticle cuttings, and why was he too rough?  He kept working on my hands, and again drilled too deeply that I felt pain, so I told him that I didn't care how long it was going to take Tran to finish with her current customer, but that I wanted him to stop and I was going to wait for her to take care of me.  Tran finally was able to do both manicure and pedicure, but we finished past closing time.  I told Tran I adored having her work on me, but that this would be the last time she'll see me.  Prior to this visit, I was a steady customer at least every three weeks- my field of work makes it necessary that my hands look great, as they are always in view of both coworkers and guests- and sometimes the gel polish would only last two weeks, so sometimes I'd see her sooner.  Each visit translated to about $65 or $70, including a 20% tip.  I could not, and WOULD NOT come back to spend my hard-earned dollars after being treated so cruelly by a misguided manager who would not listen to my concerns.  Tran-- I sincerely hope you've since left this employer.  You deserve to work with a more positive management who will treat both its employees and the customers who pay for the rent, utilities, supplies, and your paychecks with courtesy and respect.

Finally checked out the Aloha Festival today- took a Saturday off work, and the event happened to fall on this day.  We (Kevin H., Marian H., and I) were glad to arrive early (11'ish am), as there already were long lines at some of the vendors.  After doing the "once around," Kevin decided to line up at "Paradise," and after some talk, Marian decided to line up at the vendor with the "EGGROLL" banner, and see which of the lines would go faster (hers did).  It was a long wait, but once our turns came up, the ordering, paying, and receiving processes went fast.  As it turned out, part of the reason was that there wasn't much food to be had for $10...  Since Kevin had had his fill of BBQ yesterday, he decided to skip the heavy pork and beef and go for the meat jun and BBQ chicken plate lunch (with rice and macaroni salad), but instead received meat jun and kalbi (short ribs).  Meat jun is a Korean dish of thinly-sliced beef marinated with soy sauce, minced garlic, and sugar, which is then coated with a flour and egg batter and pan-fried.  It was accompanied by a red dipping sauce that stumped Kevin and Marian.  I just rechecked the recipe I found on foodland.com earlier and it calls for a dipping sauce made with soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, and red/black pepper.  The sauce Kevin and Marian tried looked like it had the red pepper blend minus the soy sauce.  I tried the meat jun and found it to be too sweet for my liking.  It reminded me of a Filipino torta (omelet, sort of), but ours are made with ground beef, garlic, and onions- definitely a savory dish, although often paired with ketchup, or even better- banana ketchup!  I usually just skip the sugar and enjoy the torta as a savory dish, but I digress...  I just ordered the short ribs, hold the rice, and instead asked for two scoops of mac salad. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tempe-beach-park-tempe?select=Aqkd_iBCRsvyuFsTdE8jsw#GdfF4jvzBJPcnWmf8vaC-w  The salad was OK-- too much mayonnaise!  Nice flavor, though.  Overall, everything was just so-so and not worth $10. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tempe-beach-park-tempe?select=Aqkd_iBCRsvyuFsTdE8jsw#dWOvXgEZ5fMkR0UsyKnd-Q  Marian's plate featured a stick of battered and fried large shrimp and a stick of BBQ chicken.  The chicken had a nice color to it and had a nice mouth-feel, but I wasn't too impressed.  The ribs I ordered were mostly bone and very fatty.  I'd say that 20 to 25% of what I received was actual meat-- the rest were bones, fat, and connective tissue.  The meat that I tried was OK, nothing special.  We also had some shave ice, but I didn't get the name of the vendor I got them from.  For $6 a pop, I could get up to three flavors, and I asked if I could also get adzuki beans and condensed milk added, as well, and the rep said OK.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tempe-beach-park-tempe?select=Aqkd_iBCRsvyuFsTdE8jsw#pt1Zmf-pRqyIcE3vVyHHxw  No added costs- cool!  Pretty certain that many people are unfamiliar with authentic HI shaved ice and so wouldn't order the additional stuff, so it was very considerate of the vendor no to charge extra for those who wanted them-- THANK YOU!  The shaved ice was alright- we tried Lihing mui, passion fruit, and guava, plus the beans and condensed milk.  I'd have to say my faves were the passion fruit and guava, which surprised me as I was looking forward to the Lihing Mui the most.  Perhaps there'll be another shaved ice vendor next year, because I will make sure to get the Saturday off work to attend!   Afterwards, we wanted to walk off some of those calories, so we took it to the lakeside and walked down to Tempe's Center for the Arts.  Nice place (check my review there).  Also, always a great plus to use restroom facilities, instead of stinky port o' potties.  (I just got shivers down my spine imagining using one of those!)  I'd have to say the best part, and I'm sure Kevin and Marian would agree, was hanging around one of the tents were Keoki Kahumoku and others held a workshop of sorts- a dynamic group of people who wanted to learn a few strumming styles and music breaks.  We saw people handing out ukeleles for others to practice with.  I found it fascinating that Keoki would call out chord changes, strum a few bars, call out animal noises, and then just have everyone dive in and play a song that progressively improved as more and more people gained their confidence and played, while Keoki sang in Hawai'ian and made animal noises-- so much fun!  With the gentle breezes flowing by, food aromas wafting in the air, and dancers springing up to hula dance, it almost felt like we were in Hawai'i!  Oh, and the OC-6 model we ended up dining next to was pretty sweet!  Kind of made up for the fact that there weren't any malasadas...  #680

I've been craving for a really good cheesesteak ever since I watched Throwdown w/ Bobby Flay: Cheesesteak a few days ago (on DVR).  I thought it a perfect time to visit friend Anthony Duca's baby, Daddy Duke's in Avondale.  (Truth be told, I've promised Anthony I'd try his family's cooking years ago when his son-in-law used to own the Philadelphia Sandwich Co. in Old Town Scottsdale.  Anthony himself used to own and run Mancini's in Phoenix before selling it and opening DD.  This is the first time I was able to live up to my promise.)    I walked into the clean, uncluttered restaurant around 4:45p.  I was surprised to see Tony there, along with his wife Mary and Tony's father, who is visiting from New Jersey.  I instantly felt at home in this space that could easily fit 100+ patrons.  As to why, I really cannot say.  The look and the vibe just took me back to the days of family dining in CA and all of the eastern states I lived in.  My server was friendly and helpful as I tried to get a few food issues cleared away.  I already knew I'd order cheesesteak, but I also wanted to try the sweet potato fries here.  [I needed to find out if they were of the same version sold at the PSC, bec. I did not like the ones I tried there.  When Mary said that DD serves pancake syrup with their fries here, I knew to stay away (PSC serves its fries w/ syrup, too.)]  I was also torn between silencing my cheesesteak craving or ordering the special this evening, which was penne with prosciutto and peas with a garlic butter sauce.  In the end, I wished I'd tried the pasta.    The 10' cheesesteak I chose was steak, provolone, and grilled onions in a roll.  The bread had a nice crust on the outside and was soft on the inside.  Since I'm a fan of crusty bread, I'll have to ask them to carve out some of the soft bread next time, since it really was too much bread for me.  The meat and the fried onions were good, but the cheese was lacking, and when Mary asked me if I was enjoying the sandwich, I told her it was just "ok" since it needed more cheese.  As I opened up the other half of the roll to show her, she asked "Well, where's the cheese?"  She immediately corrected the oversight, and the sandwich was a little tastier after that.  I wasn't going to order anything for dessert since I'd planned to go to Angel Sweet in Chandler for some gelato, but the dessert sign on the table exclaimed "Cannoli, Pumpkin roll, Cheesecake, Eat me!," so I had asked if the cannolis and the pumpkin roll contained **.  The baker reported yes on both, but no allergens in the pumpkin cheesecake.  "Oh, alright, I'll have the pumpkin cheesecake."  Am I glad I did, for this was the highlight of the meal!  If you're a pumpkin cheesecake lover, you must try DD's version.  You won't be sorry!  So three stars only for the cheesesteak and the overall service- clean, uncluttered space; clean restroom; and inviting atmosphere.  My original server had to leave early, and my other server didn't come to check as often as the first; otherwise, I may have rated an extra star for the service alone (it irked me a little that, after fruitlessly waiting for my server to pick up my check and credit card, I had to walk over to the register to pay for my meal myself- don't know if this is standard practice here).  The extra star was for the awesome cheesecake- the pumpkin and cream cheese filling was so light and tasted exquisite with the graham cracker crust.  The light dusting of cinnamon was just perfect!  I'd drive 17 miles one-way just to eat another slice.  BTW, plan on visiting for dinner around the same time (5'ish), as the parking lot started to fill up by the time I left (around 5:30p).  p.s.  I will have to try the sweet potato fries next time I visit DD's.  I think weeks' old oil may have been the culprit at PSC (dirty-looking, soggy fries tasted very greasy- inedible, I thought).

It's been almost five months since my first visit, and I thought it's about time I gave Daddy Duke's a second chance.  I called in my order at around 2:15p of Penne Romagno ($9.95) for dine-in since I hadn't had anything to eat since 11p the night before.  I arrived at DD's around 2:25 only to find that the cook had waited until my arrival to start on the dish- I spotted him cutting up the peppers and prosciutto and adding them to the pan.  The pasta was delivered to my table about ten minutes later.  I decided to try their sweet potato fries ($4.50), extra crispy, without the pancake syrup it normally is served with.    I loved the penne dish!  Mind you, it didn't look as appetizing as it could have; I thought that the glistening prosciutto looked half-cooked.  One bite took care of that suspicion- it was delicious!  The feta cheese (some crumbled, some still sporting shape of the container it was shaped in) and roasted red peppers dressed the dish up a bit.  The SPF looked great, but wasn't as crispy as it looked, so in they went for a second frying.  Needless to say, they didn't look as delectable when they were brought back, but at least they were of the texture I was looking for.  I also tried their two-pizza slice and soda lunch special ($5, add. topping $0.50 each), with ricotta and roasted red peppers.  I did ask if they used corn in their pizza and was told no.  Not even on the bottom to make the pizzas slide easier out of the oven.  I don't know how I forgot to ask if they served thin-crust since it is my preferred choice, but I did, and sure enough, the slices that were brought to my table were more doughy than I cared for.  I thought perhaps the wider edge fo the pizza crust would at least deliver the crispiness I was looking for, but the crunch factor disappeared, no exaggeration, within two minutes or less from time of arrival.  The ricotta looked fantastic, and while the red peppers looked OK, they weren't roasted.  The marinara sauce used was good.    DD's now serves Berto's gelato desserts (triangular wedges of differing flavors, including chocolate hazelnut, cappucino crunch, white princess, and spumoni)!  Cheesecake flavors come in plain, strawberry- or raspberry topped, and oreo.  A server told me they're trying to convince management/pastry chef into baking a peanut butter cheesecake.  Sounds like a great plan to me!  Don't recall seeing a water fountain indoors during my first visit, but there certainly is one now.  The stuffed Easter bunnies adorning the feature (they've also invaded the women's restroom!) do not lend the restaurant a classy look, although I think it's a more casual atmosphere the owners are trying to achieve here.  Finding another way to advertise Sunday breakfasts and other specials, currently achieved by posting copy paper over the green window shutters and any wall space available, would do wonders for the ambience.  Seriously, the signs posted on the entrance door, on the register counter, and those propped on the dining tables are sufficient!

Decided to try my luck at getting some of those good-looking cinnamon-sugar donuts (complete w/ the donut holes!) from FnB today, as I always came too late before-- I figured "third time lucky," and surprise (!), this time I was actually TOO early!  Pavle told me I had to wait another 15 minutes.  Thought I'd head over to Truckin' Good Food and place my order, since a crepe normally takes 12 to 15 minutes to prepare due to all of the people lining up for their fix of French delights.  (I also thought that if I limited the time I had to check out the various vendors and their wares, that I could save myself some $$!  The last time I visited, I spend around $44!)  Some of these vendors are sneaky, though, apppealing to my sweet tooth, so I just HAD to sample a vendor's (sorry I didn't get the name!) Espresso Almond brittle (may get some on my next visit!) and the three toffee varieties (almond, dark chocolate and seasalt, and hazelnut) that GoodyTwos had on display.  Loved the toffees so much, that I bought two quarter-pound bags of the almond and hazelnut, although I loved the dark chocolate one w/ the same intensity as the other two!  Purchase total thus far?  $15.  Oof!  I better get myself to T'GF, stat!  No Brittany crepe today again.  :(  Jeff explained that he didn't have access to the buckwheat honey anymore.  In fact, he didn't know where the vendor went.  That's too bad.  I hope Jeff finds another supplier soon-- I counted two honey vendors there this morning, but I didn't stop to ask if they offered buckwheat...  W/ the absence of the Brittany, I was stuck w/ ordering "My First Time," which really isn't a negative, as today's version was well-prepared!  Really loved the crunch that the walnuts added (my previous serving lacked walnuts-- Jeff had just run out) to the Nutella and banana goodness!  Breakfast crepe= $5.  While waiting for my crepe, I wandered over to Moms Gone Nuts and tried the roasted cinnamon almonds and cashews (other varieties incl. walnuts, pecans, and even one spiced w/ jalapenos and "smart sugar," a processed white cane sugar that makes for a lighter finished product that doesn't require as much sugar to coat the nuts).  I bought a bag each of the almonds and cashews= $9.  Last, but not least, I had to get my ration of zaatar bread and hummus (will provide vendor name later), which cost $11 (the cost of the bread went up from $5 to $6).    Total cost this Saturday morning?  $40!  That blows my theory (see above) out of the park, but I really don't mind, since the money went in support of local businesses.  I love it when I have some free time during my most-favorite part of the day to enjoy beautiful weather outdoors, have a wonderful breakfast, and meet new people!  p.s.  Almost forgot!  Went back to FnB and found a line of people also waiting to get their hands on those freshly-made donuts, so I too fell in line.  This gave me a chance to watch Charleen in action, quickly making those Roasted Chicken Tortas, w/ bean spread and chipotle mayo on ciabatta bread ($10).  These looked so good, I almost wanted to get one for Mom to try!  Maybe next time.  Those brownies w/ pecans and figs ($2 each) looked really great, as well, but I have to stay away from pecans.  :(  Might as well, as this morning's excursion was expensive!  Five donuts (and donut holes), $5.    Out the door damages?  $45.  Darn it!!   (Tip: Don't buy too many donuts, unless you plan on sharing them w/ others RIGHT AWAY... they were already hardening when I bought them and were almost like stone four hours later!  Maybe keeping them under wraps on the tray at the stall had something to do w/ this?)

09/08/11  Great place for gourmet burgers, but pricey!  I was in the area, returning an item at Bev Mo', when I noticed that the burger place I'd been reading about from so many Yelp friends was right next door.  I had just noticed a Now! Groupon deal that morning where $12 bought $20 worth of food there, so I went in and had a look at the menu and decided that the groupon deal was worth checking out.  Looking at the happy hour menu, I see that it's 3:30p-6:30p Sundays (beer /wine) and Mondays (domestic beer/sliders) and 4p-close Ladies' Night Tuesdays and Wednesdays (1/2 off apps and drinks).  I'll have to check HH on a Wednesday soon!  After poring over the menu for a few minutes and asking lots of questions (organic and local produce and meats are used whenever possible), I decided to customize a Kobe burger w/ gruyere, mixed greens, sprouts, grilled onions, and pepperoncini, on an oatmeal-topped wheat bun, with an apricot chipotle sauce.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=7HkjJq2083qp9TxBduhkTw  I upgraded to sweet potato fries for an extra charge.  Sounds great, right?  And it was!  Loved everything on my plate!!  The bun is from a local bakery and made fresh everyday; the veggies were either locally-sourced or organic; and the beef used here are all-natural (no hormones and not GMO).  The sweet potato fries were perfect!!  And the sauce!!  Very tasty- sour-sweet from the apricots, and very spicy!!  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA&select=x6pvF_xqhv5mseBAvyEV6g  I also tried the Mac 'n cheese, w/ ham (extra fee).  Very, very cheesy, and very, very good!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=R2QAn4cH5v9Is0CtRpTvew Decided to skip on the apps, but what do we have here?  Complimentary homemade parmesan potato chips!  Next time, I'll have to check out one of the "adult" milkshakes and remember to make room for dessert!  :))  Can't report on the noise level, since it was pretty sleepy indoors when I stopped in at 345p.  The place looks like it picks up a bit later at night, though... The servers were a bit too cool for my tastes-- warm up the room w/ a few smiles and courtesy, please!

03/14/12  I had a couple of groupons to use up, so on this visit I decided to try Indulge's chili-and-cheese fries, their chili (to go), and their adult coffee milkshake.  The fries came out fast, and even though they were very greasy (as to be expected), the few crispy bites I had were sufficient while I waited for my to-go burgers to arrive.  (I ended up throwing out 4/5 of the fries entree.)  Some of the burgers I'd ordered were missing some toppings (cheese and other toppings I chose by checking those boxes on the order forms the server hands you to fill out), and of the four burgers I asked to be cooked medium, three were actually either medium-well or well-done.  (The only one cooked to medium was the burger I had tried at the restaurant.)  The best part of my experience here today was the coffee milkshake!  It was made with vanilla ice cream, Adult chocolate milk (you may buy a bottle at Bev Mo or Total Wine, I'm told), coffee, and Kahlua, and it's only $8.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=PGuZSDEwBBFrORLlSgEz7g  I say skip the burgers and apps here and just go for a milkshake!  I had the feeling that Indulge (and the staff) do not appreciate their guests that use groupons.  My server was initially helpful with my questions, but when it finally dawned on her that I was using a groupon, the initial warm service turned definitely chilly.  And why not?  She was guaranteed to make around 18-20% tip (around $20 for a pre-tax food value of around $109)!    http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=9RBD09ksq3s1RfxZVIRvnQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=uKfvo5vvQcd6JzoJPeLpNQ  03/16/12  I had one more groupon to use, so I met a friend here for dinner, and somewhat reluctantly at that, since I knew the service wasn't going be anything special.  (And I was right!  Even my friend made an observation, "I don't think our server likes me very much."  I told him later it's bec. she knew she was going to make an easy $20...)  The deal came with a couple of apps, four burgers, and a bottle of wine, so we placed our order for the burgers, and I chose sweet potato fries (to go), as well as the Mac 'n cheese app, but not before I asked our server (the same one I had two days ago) if I could order the side of mac 'n cheese as an app (it fell within the price specification for the apps included in the groupon deal).  Our server said yes.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=ygY8t5CvOJsB_aHFQUyvrg  Turned out, the dish wasn't included in the deal, so I still had to choose another app to take home (the parmesan chips that used to be complimentary, and that which I had mentioned in my first Indulge review).  The burgers we had at the restaurant were good, even though mine came out medium-well, instead of medium.  The other two burgers I took to-go were medium-well (I specified medium), but at least these weren't missing any toppings this time.  (Funny how I was reduced to counting my lucky stars on having *some* of the order specifications heeded when ALL should've been guaranteed as per the order sheet filled out...)  I won't be returning to Indulge anymore, as I did not appreciate the less-than-above-average guest service and sub-par food given on these two visits.  I don't know why some businesses that participate in these groupon events end up offering less-than-stellar service and products when I know they can do so much better.  The goal is to bring in and develop a larger fan/customer base, so this is when you should shine!  I used to understand why businesses added the gratuity (to keep the servers from being under-tipped), but I usually tip 20% (and even much more if the service was over-and-above what I expected), but to see my hard-earned money greedily taken while my guest and I end up with sub-par service AND products, it makes me sick to further recommend this establishment to others.  From four stars to one... I have aunts and a cousin who enjoyed their food here a long time ago, but I won't be taking them, nor anyone else, here again!!

After waiting for many months to have my garbage disposal appraised for a dislodgement or repair (I didn't want to call on a repairman for just one item), I suddenly needed a plumber to fix a toilet tank that wouldn't stop leaking when the shut-off valve failed do the trick.  I checked on Yelp and Gabi came to my rescue!  Based on Gabi's and Karri's reviews, I did not need another referral to fall back on- if Duane was good enough for Gabi, then he was good enough for me!  I called Duane on Monday hoping I could have him visit the house that afternoon, but I'd have been happy if he could see me as early as Thursday.  Duane informed me that while he was fully booked that day, he could see me the following day, which meant I'd have to call out of work.  As much as I hate calling out of work unless I'm really sick, I knew that 1.) a leaking tank needed attention or else my house may necessitate lengthier, and costlier, amendments later on should the leakage cause other problems, and 2.) one should never waste water, especially living out here in the desert!    Not only did Duane attend to all the repairs in 90 minutes the next afternoon, but included in that time, he also assisted in choosing a garbage disposal at a nearby Home Depot to replace the one that wouldn't work anymore, despite his assumption that it was nothing more than a stuck penny or broken glass- this has happened once before.  I should add that I had him look into a second toilet tank that a housemate had complained about.  Where a disreputable repairman could have taken this opportunity to charge me for unneeded repairs, Duane revealed to me his honest and trustworthy nature in telling me that the tank didn't need any repairs done!  He was also more than happy to show me how to do future repairs myself and also offered to walk me through them via phone in the future, should I elect to go that route!  I agree with Gabi and Karri in that his fees are more than fair, and that he is a very amiable and approachable individual.  With so many admirable facets, as well as all-around handyman and social skills, Duane is most definately a diamond!

What a great breakfast spot!    Came here for a quick one yesterday before heading over to work for our complimentary annual flu shot and work after.  The weather was delightful enough that I toyed with the idea of dining outside, but wasn't sure if smoking was allowed (I don't smoke).  I decided to dine in at the counter, but did find out that smoking isn't allowed in all dining areas, at least not in Scottsdale!  I'll have to try patio-dining with friends soon.  Had ordered the biscuits and gravy platter, which came with herbed potatoes and fruit, but all I really wanted was a biscuit and gravy, and soon spotted it among the sides menu and cancelled the original.  My only complaint during yesterday's experience was that I felt my server had pressured me into ordering more than I had wanted to.  I'd asked if their gravy was chunky since most of the places that boast "sausage gravy" LIE, and she assured me that I'd love their chunky gravy, so I knew not to order a side of sausage patties, but she had asked me more than three times if I wanted to order two sides, so I thought of trying the bacon, but decided against it when my inquiry of whether or not it contained corn syrup and celery juice came back positive.  So I went with the patties.  There wasn't a need to order more meat as the side of B&G is ample enough for little young me :)  [This dish kept me going for almost six hours!]  I loved this spicy breakfast item so much, I came back for more this morning!  I literally bumped into an old friend, at the Mayo Clinic of all places!, and we thought it'd be nice catch up during breakfast afterwards.  I arrived earlier and placed my order in for a biscuit and gravy ($3.95) and one stuffed pancake ($2.95).  I chose the peach creme brulee.  (This was going to be a treat as I haven't had peaches in three years!)  No powdered sugar, please, and FYI, the pancake syrup here isn't 100% maple.  My friend, who exercises and counts calories as much as I do, was going to look at the pancake list when I, recalling he liked egg-white omelets, told him that DD offered an egg-white wrap.  He instantly ordered this, but also ordered a blueberry and banana pancake made w/ honey whole wheat.  (I'd lamented that the server hadn't asked me for my batter preference, so my pal said he'd order one with whole wheat, for me to try.  A pleasant double-surprise was when he chose blueberries and banana, the latter which I haven't eaten in three years!)  He absolutely loved his egg-white wrap.  I almost tried a bite, but didn't want to play with fire since I was already trying my luck with the peaches and the banana.  (The wrap contained eggs and mushrooms...)  I loved both of the pancakes- the peach creme brulee was perfect w/out any added butter or syrup, but my friend's pancake needed a little maple syrup.  Thank goodness I always carry some, just in case!  =)  Can't wait for that upcoming UYE a yelper teased about during our jaunt at Haus Murphy's ;)

10/24  Couldn't wait till a Friday UYE at DD, so I opted to go on my own and try the Daily Dose Kobe burger and sweet potato fries at happy hour prices ($5, plus a $1.50 upcharge for any side dish substitution other than their hand-cut fries or regular fries).  It's not 100% Kobe, but Daily Dose's "own house blend of Kobe and beef burger patty."  I asked my server to have the sweet potato fries cooked extra-crispy, and she assured me that their way of preparing them made them very crispy.  I also ordered a glass of Cab ($5).  Loved the two pieces of thick-cut pepper-smoked bacon!  Their crispiness lent the Kobe-beef burger a much-needed textural component it greatly lacked, or so I thought.  (I'm a huge fan of the "crust" that cooking on flat-tops and grills impart on food, be they cuts of meat, stone fruits, bread, or veggies!)  I enjoyed the harissa aioli on top of the aged cheddar, but I wished that the pretzel bun spent more time in the oven/grill.  The sweet potato fries were very unsatisfactory.  I would definitely order it extra-extra crispy, or I may just try the chorizo mac 'n cheese next time I go.  The Gladiator burger ($5.50, plus fries) is calling my name...

I've had a late breakfast and two more happy hours since my last review update!    First, my late breakfast consisted of one stuffed pancake off of the side menu- peach creme brulee.  This actually first arrived as a plain pancake w/ a generous pour of creme brulee sauce w/ a dash of powdered sugar- something I specifically asked not to have added.  So, another pancake was whipped up, and again, I received a plain pancake, but this time w/ only a very thin layer of creme brulee sauce (sob!).  The missing peaches, lovely when stuffed into the batter while cooking, were added as a warmed side.  Strange that I was charged extra for a serving of creme brulee sauce when the corrected pancake was so lacking in sauce to begin with, but whatever.  I should've been more outspoken about it...  Second, I tried the gladiator burger and subbed chorizo mac 'n cheese for the fries (extra $1.50 for a total of $7 for the burger and mac).  I preferred this burger over the Daily Dose burger I had previously, and while the chorizo mac 'n cheese was tasty, it just isn't as good as that of Crust's Crusted Mac 'n Cheese!  Strange, that, since DD's version contained chorizo, which packed a powerful punch in the flavor department...  Third, I tried the chicken nachos, but instead of the corn tortilla chips, I opted for a flour tortilla wrap.  Not a problem according to my server and the manager on duty (who were very amiable).  I would order this chicken wrap again in a heartbeat!  Next time I will throw caution to the wind and have one (or more!) of their famous sangrias!

After so many review updates, I usually cease to write more unless I have something really noteworthy to add (a new menu addition or fave dish, or great customer service rendered, etc).  Unfortunately, I will have to say that this morning's breakfast of biscuits and gravy and a platter of peach creme brulee pancakes didn't have us leaving w/ happy stomachs :(    There were a couple of hitches, but these were easily amended.  (I think my love affair of DD's biscuit and gravy has ended.)  My major gripe was that our gingerbread pancakes did not contain candied ginger pieces-- did Daily Dose switch to a new mix/formulation?  If yes, please switch back!  The pancakes we had today were too dense and not at all the flavorful-spicy and texturally-exciting cakes we've had in the past :(  The peach creme brulee sauce also didn't arrive warmed, and instead was squeezed unappetizingly onto a sauce dish.  The leftovers that I usually get to enjoy again on one of my work breaks ended up in the trash.  I'm going to go back again soon to give DD another try... I'd like to keep it on my list of fave brekky places!

9/23  Had a friend meet me here for Restaurant Week.  We both weren't dressed for the Phoenician, but I didn't care (and soon, he didn't either).  It's a good thing, too, bec. in the end, we found that this place wasn't ostentatious nor that pretentious.  Dressed casually, we still managed to have a good time, despite the overall lackluster dining experience.  First off, let me say that the service could pick up their heels a bit.  By the time we received our expensive alcoholic beverage choices, more than 20 minutes had elapsed.  ($15 for a glass of Cab and $11 for a tiny glass of mimosa?  Are you serious??)  Our first plate, a sub-par Caesar salad, arrived close to an hour after we were seated.  But perhaps the fault wasn't entirely J&G's... Digestif's Caesar salad pretty much demolished all other competitors, I'd say.  How about I testify that tonight's salad was crispy.  That's saying something nice, right?  No flavor, no creamy eggy goodness, but somewhat crispy.  The decimated croutons didn't help the situation...  For the entree, we had the skirt-steak & frites.  The latter weren't any better than what you would find at McDonalds'.  (Seriously, I'm not making this up.  Just check out the photos and you'll see I'm all about the truth!)  But the skirt steak!  This baby wasn't much to gaze at, but it was tasty.  Let's just say it was delicious enough for me not to cry over the expense we spent that night on a barely-touched salad, a cheap cut of steak, three beverages, and tip.    Now onto the star of the show... chocolate cake w/ caramel ice cream!  Wait for it... homemade caramel ice cream!  And chocolate-lava cake shaped like a star.  Oh. My. Freakin'. God.  This should be renamed "Foreplay."    Nice ambience, despite it being darker than I would like and that we were seated far away from the panoramic views.  I appreciated the privacy, though.  Women's restroom was clean and orderly, and walking past little caches of wine bottles was a nice touch.  The grounds looked pretty, but I was more impressed w/ the property at The Arizona Grand...

Inspired to try ice cream topped with a fruity olive oil (thanks to an episode of "The Best Thing I Ever Ate: Sugar Rush"), I decided I'd check out Chandler's Cucina Olive Oils and see if the proprietor could recommend one.  I've wanted to check this place out ever since I noticed the space when I visited Nouveau Bistro (closed) back in October '08.  I was enthusiastically greeted by Chrissy, the owner of Cucina, who eagerly offered samples of the oils and balsamic vinegars, first by themselves and then some complementary combinations.  Soon, I was choosing four oils and vinegars to take home with me- $38 for 4 small bottles, mix and match.  (Small individual bottles were $10 for either oil or vinegar, while large bottles were  $17 for an oil and $16.50 for a vinegar.)  Should you ever decide to pay your first visit, be sure to take your time and try ALL of the oils and balsamic vinegars and not be in a rush to make a purchase and walk out.  While Chrissy was willing to let me exchange one of my choices*, I decided to let it go since she'd already placed my purchases in a gold-leafed dark brown gift bag with white and gold tissue wrap, complete with a brown and gold ribbon!  It's a very nice presentation, which could make for an impressive-looking gift.    With so many olive oils and balsamic vinegars to choose from, as well as balsamic jams, spice blends, and glazes, I appreciated the tiny store's airy, tranquil, and organized ambience.  Granted, I was only one of two customers there at that time.  (The second, a returning customer, showed up just as I was about to leave.)  I can imagine the chaos Chrissy could face if more than eight people show up at one time!  *Incidentally, I purchased two olive oils, picholine (Australia) and Meyer lemon (Tunisia), and two balsamic vinegars, fig and pomegranate.  Had I taken more time to have a longer look around, I'd have chosen the black currant balsamic vinegar over the pomegranate- WOW, such intensity in half a teaspoonsful!  FYI, both picholine and Meyer lemon oils go great on top of Julie's Organic chocolate ice cream!  (Although I did prefer the lemon.)  I imagine the wonderful blood orange olive oil I tried at the store would be just heaven on chocolate or even vanilla.  For those who are adventurous, balsamic vinegar and ice cream also complement each other rather nicely.  I actually tried both balsamic vinegars on chocolate- very nice.  I did find it strange that AZ's Queen Creek olive oils weren't offered in this setting.  Guess you'll have to either travel all the way to Queen Creek, AZ (or visit the website) or head over to Whole Foods to get them

01/05/11  2.25 stars.  Took my cousin for a five-course meal, and I unfortunately must write that I was NOT very impressed.  Yes, I have food allergies, and yes, maybe I should've just thrown caution to the wind that evening*, considering that I was going to spend $60 per person, plus a glass of wine for me, and a 20% tip, but after all the hype, I expected more flavors, more ambience... just something more than the experience I ended up with.  After speaking with our server and asking him if they served grass-fed meats or animals fed an all-natural diet, not commercial grain feed, it was at the kitchen's discretion to stick to serve seafood for me.  I wish I was told what my options were, instead of just the chefs' decision not to serve me red meat at all, or we might've gone elsewhere.  We may have just decided to stay there, who knows?  It would've been very CONSIDERATE of the chefs to have let me make that $150 decision.  I have no complaints about the dishes my cousin received-- they were delicious and nicely-presented, and she enjoyed each and every one, but to pay $60 for five uninspired courses, starting with the salad, to the same type of fish for every course, but with different vegetables, and then just undressed berries for dessert, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=Cuzo62AOE91H-c3IDlHf5g#Cuzo62AOE91H-c3IDlHf5g it was a very disappointing meal for me, which is why I haven't had the inspiration to write about the entire experience till now.  (Probably one of the best decisions I've ever made, for I surely would've ranted a year ago...)  When I pass this establishment every time I go to Camelview, I can only shake my head... :(  Amuse bouche http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=bAH29amaZhFzkR0EDBR6Kg#bAH29amaZhFzkR0EDBR6Kg Cousin's salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=BF0Cbvkv8Hyiw6L20xYR9A#BF0Cbvkv8Hyiw6L20xYR9A My salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=znJj-RMRQCL3H8gThB2TXw#znJj-RMRQCL3H8gThB2TXw One of cousin's dishes http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=Hhw95OhEp9p0zk1h-HN2CQ#Hhw95OhEp9p0zk1h-HN2CQ Fish course http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=keAr6jYxffhQQBeMRpVndA#keAr6jYxffhQQBeMRpVndA We each got one of these http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=5-2SmDYRXWfEhfwUKqdKkw#5-2SmDYRXWfEhfwUKqdKkw Frog legs http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/posh-improvisational-cuisine-scottsdale?select=MOrO3LD0BOY8-Kme8noSMw#MOrO3LD0BOY8-Kme8noSMw Another fish course.

Don't think I'll go back again for happy hour...  My friend likes outdoor dining by the bar, and I don't mind it until someone lights up a cigarette, or even worse, a cigar.  Today was a hot one, but with the occasional breeze and the intermittent misters going off and on, drinking outdoors was tolerable.    Only ordered mango mojitos today, and I surprised my friend by ordering two-- I usually just stick to the one.  Don't know why, since both of my mojitos were very sweet (as if made with a simple syrup, instead of a muddler, mint, and sugar), and I didn't even finish my first, let alone half of my second.  City iced water were in plastic glasses that had hard water stains on them.  These should be polished to keep them looking sparkling-new!    Friend had the Shrimp Martini, $13.50 during happy hour. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-martini-lounge-phoenix-3?select=U9-fli37mQMC9-vyXV0LaA  Four large shrimp with a zesty cocktail sauce that friend really enjoyed.  I wondered why only four?    Great visit with friend, but we'll try somewhere else in High Street for our next happy hour get-together.  That, or we may be back, but I'll order something else to drink (and possibly sit indoors, away from the smoke!).

1/22 and 1/23  I ADORE The Kitchen!  So much so, I ended up visiting three times in one week :)  [Unfortunately, I only have photos from the first two visits, as I had misplaced my SD card after the third].  Wow, where do I start?  The front of the venue reminds me of an AJ's Fine Foods, or a (very) mini-Whole Foods: there's the bread aisle to your right as you walk in, cash registers to your left, and straight ahead is the cold food section where you may find deli side items (along w/ roasted veggies and crisp asparagus spears), as well as prepared paninis, which they'll grill for you, if you want.  Try the white cheddar w/ truffled butter on sourdough- to die for!  I get it EVERY time, no matter what else may strike my fancy during my stay here (and I'm here for HOURS, no exaggeration).  Beside and behind this deli counter are cases of pastries and pies, charcuterie products, and cheese!  There is also a soup kiosk, as well as a sandwich station.  There is a self-serve dining section in this room, w/ a couch, or two, and coffee table, as well as bar-height tables and chairs, and a couple of electric sockets to plug into while you utilize free wi-fi!  While the sandwich maker will happily oblige you in slicing a loaf of bread you picked up from the many shelves and even toast a few slices for you to have w/ the half-pound of Tuscan chicken salad you sampled first at the deli counter, make no mistake in thinking you'll be able to flag someone down as you dine at the self-service area.  Once you pay for your items, you're on your own.  If it's effusive service you want, head over to the back of the restaurant where you'll find a wine bar to your left, a lovely dining area in the middle, and a bar counter to the right.  There's even patio dining in the back, but it was too cold to even consider that option then.  You'll find live music between 6p and 9p on Friday nights.  The times I spent there, the group Slave to the Groove played.  One of the two musicians used to be a chef :)  In between the sections of self- and full-service, you'll find a coffee bar, featuring Portland Roasting Company coffee, where you may also purchase pastries, such as muffins, cookies, and scones, and to its right, you will find the pizza/hot grill station, where pizzaiolos/cooks busily prepare your pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, or even roast prime rib while you wait!  (The lay-out of TK is, to me, nicely done.  I wish my home could feel like this!  Oh, and did I mention there is free wi-fi??  Not hard to imagine that I've spent hours here, now, is it?)  Before I go on and on, let me just list a few items I really enjoyed:   1. White cheddar panini w/ truffled butter, $4 (don't forget to have it pressed!).  Perfect w/ that $5 glass of wine during happy hour. 2. Prosciutto, goat cheese, fig, and arugula bruschetta w/ aged balsamic vinaigrette- a great deal on their happy hour menu! 3. Apple crumble w/ vanilla-bean ice cream!  p.s.  Their caffe latte is superb!  I have it w/out sugar, so that I can justify splurging on a cookie (or two!)- the white chocolate macadamia nut or the oatmeal-raisin pairs up well.  (I'd pass on the chocolate chip cookie- the chips used aren't of great quality, IMHO).     Whether you're here for lunch, happy hour, coffee break, or dinner, you'll find The Kitchen a worthwhile choice.  (Did I mention they also serve breakfast?  Menu looks divine; I haven't been, but if someone sets up a breakfast UYE here, I'll try my best to attend!)

***CLOSED***  Had dinner at Bloom two nights ago and noticed it was lights out (and no sign) at The Kitchen.  Asked our server when TK had closed- "about two or three months" ago.  How could so much time have elapsed w/out any news of this (on Yelp, no less!)?

11/18/15 Returned this morning to use the second Groupon I purchased, which was to expire today.  This is Mom's and my second visit (our first was in July, when sister and her two kids were visiting, so they accompanied us then).  Mom and I weren't impressed with the meal we had then, which included dinuguan, lechon paksiw, longsilog (longganisa, which is similar to chorizo, and "itlog," which translates to "egg," and fried rice dish), lechon kawali, and porksilog (pork chop, eggs, and rice).  I believe we even ordered a BBQ item, and asked for a side of rice (two scoops for $1), which were then rung up together as one two-item dish that cost an extra $2 over what we initially ordered as a la carte!  I decided to give the woman (the owner?) the benefit of the doubt and didn't complain.  Everything was greasy and bland.  Sister liked her longganisa dish very much, though, since it had been a long time since she last had it.  Fast-forward to today's breakfast of longsilog for me, with a side of tocino, and a tapsilog (tapas, eggs, and fried rice), with a side of bangus (fried milkfish) for Mom, and a Halo-Halo special ($1 more than the regular order of Halo-Halo), and again everything was greasy (Mom actually did what I suggested and patted down the meats with tissue paper to soak up some of the grease!) and bland.  Sad to say, but the only thing we both enjoyed was the "Halo-halo Especial." http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/halo-halo-kitchen-phoenix?select=WWzdttOk7G2J3qbOLQk5QA  We thought the tiny scoop (between a quarter of a scoop to a third of a scoop'ish) of ube ice cream looked pitiful, but I didn't really feel like speaking to the woman/owner up front anymore, since this was going to be our last visit here.  While we were waiting for our food to arrive, Mom was asking whether we should order some crispy pata, or lechon kawali to go, but by the end of our meal, she'd changed her mind.  Two very disappointing experiences, with each roundtrip costing us forty-eight miles of travel!   Very sad to say that we will not be supporting this Filipino-owned "turo-turo" business in the future.  :(  #790

Today was my third visit!  I only learned about the place a little over a year ago (I moved into the area during the first quarter of 2011), but I only paid my first visit last week!  I've concentrated on just one trail, pushing myself to go further (and quicker) each time, and I still haven't finished the complete lap.  It's a great workout, and today I learned that the further you  go into a specific trail, the rougher the path gets.  Great views, clean air, and a great workout each and every time.  If you haven't visited MSP, you must rectify this immediately!  :)

10/09  Had an impromptu breakfast here with a friend.  The plan was for me to show him how great a breakfast one could have at The Farm at South Mountain's Morning Glory Cafe, but my car overheated and lost power at 32nd St. and Baseline, so I asked him if he would please find out if "Down Home Kitchen" is still open for business.  Thankfully,  he came back to report that "Fat Daddy's Down Home Kitchen" is still open, but that it was "totally dead in there."  Poor FD.  I told my friend that I wasn't surprised since a few of the people I know that have tried FD's found the prices to be too high for the quality of food offered.  However, we were hungry and circumstances forced us to try having breakfast here.  Price-wise, my friend couldn't complain.  He enjoyed his breakfast of scrambled eggs with sausage, bacon, and cheese, although he did accuse me of dragging him to an early grave :(  He wasn't complaining, he said, since he liked grease-spoons,  just sayin' is all :)  Seems like he's better at choosing the better entree (see Joe's Farm Grill), since my biscuits and gravy with extra sausage links, gratis (many thanks to our server, who received a very nice tip!) were among the most undistinctive I've ever tasted, especially after having, for two consecutive mornings, the best biscuit and gravy dish at Scottsdale's Daily Dose!  Perhaps next time I'll just order the fail-safe candied yams and brown sugar baked beans...

2/23/10  Sat at the patio to admire the colorful and lush surroundings, but at the expense of sitting on very damp cushions, which I didn't even notice until I had risen to go the restroom to wash my hands before having a bite to eat.  (Another man sitting at the next table eventually stood up to look for drier cushions, as well.)  Service was very friendly- that is, up until I paid, but more about this later.  Ordered the weekly drink special- the rose margarita.  Delicious!  Pretty, too.    For apps, I tried the Cilantro hummus ($2) and the Grilled steak skewers ($5).  Loved the hummus and pita, and the pita also paired well w/ the spicy cheese sauce that came w/ the steak skewers.  As for the skewers themselves... these were processed meat pieces, not from fresh steaks.  I did not appreciate the texture.  (I'm very interested to read about others' opinions on this dish.)  To think I received more satisfaction from a $2 dish and a cheese sauce!  At least the margarita was very good...  As I've said, the service was very friendly, and patient, answering all of my allergy concerns.  I had a very hard time securing a working outlet for my laptop, though, w/ my server and the assistant manager saying that the outlet that I found was "out-of-service."  Yet, a third server/runner enthusiastically offered to get maintenance to have a look at the outlet, only to be intercepted by the asst. mgr., and suddenly, I was out of luck again.  Apparently, the asst. manager didn't want me to have use of my laptop while sitting outside.  Too bad, bec. I would've ordered another drink AND a dessert had I been able to stay much longer, but my dying battery had me packing and looking for an outlet to use elsewhere.  (Also, when it looked like I wasn't going to have access to an outlet, and after repeated visits from the server regarding dessert, I decided to ask for my receipt.  It took quite awhile to get the table ticket.  It seemed like when she knew I wasn't planning on ordering anything more, the friendly service disappeared.  Where once I had two or more reps coming over asking if I needed their assistance, I now couldn't even flag down one for a glass of water!)  I'd like to come back to surround myself again in such sensuous and verdant environs; I just will be sure not to visit right after it rains.  I may even just skip R-Bar and try Rita's Kitchen or BLT Steak's happy hour menus, instead.  Perhaps it's best not to return at all?  I wouldn't want to trouble the Camelback Inn staff to wait on a troublesome customer such as myself...

Met an old friend here for lunch yesterday, Saturday 4/25.  We started a Thai iced coffee (for her) and a Thai iced tea (for me).  I had informed our server of my food allergies, of which he took time to notate down before heading of to the kitchen.  He did say that Thai Taste is more than willing to accomodate by omitting the ingredients I couldn't eat and substituting items that are more appropriate.  I asked if TT made their own curry pastes, and he said yes (and no, they do not use shrimp or shrimp paste in their curry pastes!).  I had spotted the daily specials board located outside by the front entrance that included soft-shelled crab (2 pcs.) with chu chee sauce and jasmine rice for $16.95.  (Mango sticky rice and Thai fried ice cream (!) were also featured.)  Our server said that if we did not like chu chee sauce (a coconut-based red curry sauce traditionally used with seafood, such as scallops and prawns/shrimp), we could opt for basil or ginger sauce.  I was also eyeing Pud Thai (their spelling) or green curry with tofu.  When I told Tina about the crab special, she ooh'ed and ah'ed, so we decided we'd split an entree.  Our server, however, had bad news- he was just told he'd have to go to the grocery for a crab run as the kitchen had just run out! Tina decided she would get the Larb with chicken (basically a spicy dish of ground chicken lettuce wraps), and I ordered the green curry.  Tina started her meal with celery soup, a soup I'd encountered at almost every Thai venue I've eaten at, but this version contained grains that looked like barley.  She thought it was good.    We didn't have to wait long for our entrees.  Her larb with chicken came out first, and what a beautiful sight it was!  It smelled marvelous, too, and Tina dished out a generous serving for me to try.  My green curry, with carrots, peas, green beans, bamboo shoots, broccoli, and tofu, was not far behind; The bowl in which it was served in was smaller than I've seen elsewhere, and without the usual accompaniments of soup and eggroll (due to my food allergies), $7.95 for a basically a cup of green curry and jasmine rice was pricey.  I think the kitchen added broccoli to sub for the eggroll, as it was not listed as an ingredient in green curry.  (For anyone with a mustard allergy- broccoli is listed as one of over 300 plants within the mustard family.)  I have to say that this green curry dish ranks as one of the best I've ever tried (mirroring Phoenix's Thai Elephant's on Adams and Thai Hut's, Mesa's Palee's Crown's, and Scottsdale's Tottie's Asian Fusion's)!  I could drink the green curry elixir straight  from the bowl!  It was that good!  Clean, comfortable setting, great food, awesome service, and bright and clean women's restroom- what more can one ask for?  Ah, maybe an ample supply of soft-shelled crabs?  Haha!  No worries there, as the menu seems very promising!  Great QC spot for Thai!  I'll be visiting again before flying home.  (Actually, I wasn't able to go back a second time, but my sister took her coworker to lunch soon after, and they both LOVED the green curry!)

9/18  98 South is open for business again!  When did this happen?  A friend and I stopped in for a drink and checked out the band and two singers for a bit.  I really liked the female singer- she had lovely strong vocals and danced energetically along to the song.  I only heard her sing once, and her other partner sang to the style of Frank Sinatra, my friend's favorite, for the rest of the time we were there.    I decided to try the mojito, while my friend ordered a Miller Light.  The bartender, with big blonde hair and a very ample, um, countenance, handed me my drink after a few minutes and had to ask what my pal was having again.  While she retrieved his bottle from the fridge, I tried the mojito.  I wished I hadn't.  It was VERY HEAVY on the mint syrup.  I'm used to drinks made w/ muddled fresh mint, but if she had used a light hand on the syrup, I probably wouldn't have minded.  I had asked if she'd re-do the drink, and she said "sure," but not w/out showing her dissatisfaction.  She returned w/ two glasses- the revised drink and leftovers from the original, should I "want to have more alcohol."  As she handed him his beer, he gave her his credit card, to which she SHOUTED back a "What do you want to do with this!?"  He was so taken aback, he had repeated the question and almost retorted back an apt response, but decided against it, just to help speed the transaction along.    I'm just glad that my companion enjoyed the jazz accompaniment, bec. I felt so bad he had to pay $12 for that terrible mojito drink, which he had me abandon after taking a photo of it.  Lesson learned: Just like with food menu selections, I should find out how they prepare their drinks.  (I really did think that a nice place like this wouldn't cut corners and use such saccharin-sweet syrups...) --- 10/16  Just received an email from "Iolanda" who wanted to clarify that  a.)  98 South only serves Bud Light.  Our bad.  My friend did order a Miller Lite, but did have to settle with a Bud light. b.)  98 South does not use mint syrup- only fresh mint and simple syrup.  Whatever they used, it was very heavy with too-sweet syrup.  So bad was the experience for my friend that he swears never to try another mojito again.  Not even one made by yours truly- ask the people I served at a party months ago... I can make a decent mojito! c.)  She swears her credit card statement went "What do you want me to do with this?  Go shopping?"  Sorry, sweetie, but my friend and I both disagree.  In the end, my friend paid $12 for a lousy drink I had to abandon, and you still received a tip, bec. my friend is still a gentleman.   d.)  Our bartender's name is Iolanda.

Received two more messages from "Iolanda" this morning.  Thought some of you might get a kick out of reading them.  I'm definitely never going back to 98 South.  Hope this info helps some of you...  BTW, don't you just love orangeheads??  Doling out insults are so much easier when hiding behind a mask!  19 minutes ago: Obviously rebuttal is not your friend but jealously is your neighbor......  9 minutes ago: Thought the drink was for your gentleman friend but your the one that had to abandoned it.....You really shouldn't have your picture posted ......pug!!! I mean easy target....Lets go west side .............yeppie!!!

08/18/11  I initially reserved an uncovered spot at a discounted daily rate of $7.15 (reg. rate $8.95) online for this location, but then spotted a special daily rate of $6.40 at the Washington location, so I reserved a spot over there.  I called to let this location know that I didn't need the reservation anymore, but was told that I needn't have made one in the first place since there were many available spots.    Rushing to make the flight on time, I typed in the wrong address into my GPS after my companion handed me the wrong sheet of paper w/ the parking info on it.  I asked the attendant if this location would honor the other location's rate, and he said yes.  (FastTrack will soon be known as The Parking Spot, as well.)  Sure enough, when it came time to pay, after we arrived from our vacation, the new attendant honored the coupon, bringing the total for six days' parking to $38.40.    But that's not the best part!  Before the attendant lifted the gate to let us through, he asked if we'd like some water.  Why, yes, and thank you!  (I really wasn't looking forward to being thirsty for the next 21 miles.)

11/22/10  After missing my exit (brain was on "auto-drive," and my hands steered the car on its usual path heading home), I had a little trouble finding the parking lot due to being unaccustomed to the city's roads and their one-way signs, but once I found the site, it was smooth sailing.  Was able to save a few bucks over long-term airport parking.  I actually stumbled onto FastTrack while purchasing airplane tickets online.  Before I clicked "purchase" for parking, I thought to check directly w/ FT's website, and voila!, I found it cheaper to bypass Orbitz' link!  (FYI: you may choose covered or uncovered parking-- the former will, of course, cost more.)  We had two different shuttle drivers, and while the first was friendly enough, the second one actually de-boarded the shuttle to take our roll-ons onto the bus AND did the same when we alighted at the parking lot.  Yes, he didn't just take our bags out of the bus and place them at our feet, but actually took the roll-ons and placed them IN MY CAR!  Talk about great service!  Accordingly, I tipped him more than I did the other guy.  Shuttles arrive at the airport to pick you up and take you to the parking lot at regular intervals, but you can always call the dispatcher using the number on the card the driver provides to make sure a driver is on his/her way.  We're definitely going to use this service again in the future!

4/18/12  Very, very good late lunch/early dinner meal for me, and it all started with a classic mojito.  Not the Garden mojito on the specialty cocktails menu that has cucumber in it (allergy).  Just a mojito made from a well rum, in this case Bacardi.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=9-cZ-SOtiX2ihwdrCs2FrQ  $6 during happy hour.  And it's a good one!  Fresh, muddled mint, a bit of lime juice, a spritz of ginger ale, sugar, and rum.  Initially I thought it a bit too sweet (from the ginger ale, instead of carbonated soda) but perhaps the alcohol content had something to do with my change of mind... :)  I was considering a bruschetta plate with two cheeses, but decided against it when I had a look at the dessert menu.  Nope, I'm just going to have a small plate of Pesto chitarra ($10) and perhaps the cherry zeppole later.  I have to tell you, I've been dreaming about this pasta dish for years, since the first time I saw another Yelper post a picture of it somewhere.  Years!!  And today's dish did not disappoint.  No, not at all.  You'd think after a few years' buildup on how spectacular this plate looks, I might not enjoy it so much, but I was happy with it.  Yep, I'm just going to come out and say it-- I ate the whole thing!  Every "guitar" string, all the grape tomato halves (which, honestly, wasn't hard to do, since there were only two whole pieces to speak of), each and every grated parmesan-coated pine nut, and all of the pesto sauce. I may have left some charred bits of the toasted focaccia bread on the plate, but what wasn't charred I used to sop up all of that pesto-infused EVOO.  The entire entree was off the hook!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=wYz23WxyjrTKUXsSUwnKSw    Now, this is where any practical and health-conscious person would say, "Ok, I've had enough.  I can't eat another bite."  But, I can't be practical.  Not when I'm half-way through my mojito!  So, I went ahead and ordered the zeppole ($6.50), and it took more than a few minutes to arrive, but I wasn't in a hurry.  When the six little Italian puffs of sugar-coated fresh-fried dough arrived, accompanied by two small pots of almond crema and Maker's Mark bourbon mascarpone, I knew I was in for a treat!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/k1QpHAkzKTrFYfk6u--VgQ?select=0-sLOjmoMEBkWAcTZyHskQ  Even before I took a bite, I could detect the scent of cherries that were inside the fried moulds of dough, some of which you could see peeking through the sparkling sugar crystals.  And yes, I ate all six of them, and all of the almond crema.  There was no doubt that the mascarpone contained bourbon- it's pretty strong, and I didn't mind it, not at all, especially when you combine it with the almond, but had I known just how much i'd enjoy the almond crema, I'd have them give me two pots of it, instead of the mascarpone.  Now I know.  4.25 stars.    Can't wait to go back!

09/02/10  I've dined a few times at Arizona Grand's restaurants, many of them now gone (Latitude 30 and The Phantom Horse Grill).  The Lobby Grill is a smaller version of TPHG- same furnishings, different location.  I'd have eaten here earlier if I could've found it-- just follow the signs until it seems you've gone too far, and you're almost there!  Don't worry about finding parking spaces-- it may look like a long walk, but it's really just around the corner, down the "hill."    There was a little confusion as it seemed that the main dining room was closed and seating was only at the bar, but the host was nice enough to let us sit at a booth; This was a relief, as it looked cold and dark inside the bar, and warm and bright inside the main room.  Service was a bit slow, despite the facts that there was only a family of three (one was a toddler) seated before us, and I'd already perused through the menu online-- I knew what I wanted to try!  (Oh, how I'd rejoice when the day comes where I can place my order online so that it would be ready to serve when I am seated!)  We ordered the Filet bleu cheese pizza and the Reinvented Waldorf salad.  This order took awhile (35-40 minutes!) to arrive, so it would be in your best interests to bring something to read if you're dining alone, or if the members of your group aren't into small talk.  Thankfully, there's a gift shop across the hall!  As far as resort gift shops go, this isn't shabby at all.  It even carries Brighton jewelry!  Be warned, their inventory doesn't carry the newer items you'll find at the mall.  But I'm not here to talk about silver watches...  I included the prices of our entrees and they were a bit high, but when my Mom is willing to overlook the higher costs to have another slice of that wonderful pizza, w/ such tender chunks of filet and pungent bleu cheese (we ate all but a small slice, which I took home and ate for dinner that evening!), or the terrific salad (the candied walnuts were addictive!), then I know I've found a winner of a dining venue!  We'll be back very soon!

02/07/10 Ordered take-out, Whitey's White (white cheese pizza, alfredo sauce, and garlic.  Crust was too thick for mel- no crispy bits ANYWHERE.  Taste was OK, but not good enough for me to order again; I also had allergy issues after, but it's to be expected at chain locations such as this.  Tried reheating a couple of slices the next day, but they weren't any good (didn't crisp up, flavors gone), so I had to trash the rest.  Too bad- it would've been a great take-out place to hit up after visiting w/ friends in the area...

I've been avoiding writing this review as this place holds bittersweet memories for me, but my unwritten reviews are stacking up, and I hate being a procrastinator, so here goes...  Loved the atmosphere!  Alison and I decided to come here to try their "staff meals," which are served from 10p till closing.  The restaurant usually serves two to three dishes, labeled as such, at discounted prices.  We thought it was a great way to sample menu fare w/out losing our wallets (although, in retrospect, the very small portions necessitated our ordering more, so, really, I didn't find the staff meals to offer such great savings, but I digress).  It was such a nice evening that we decided we'd dine outside.  New friends would join us at a later time that evening.  (We were lucky enough to score a table by the crackling fireplace.  So romantic- take note, guys!)  Alison was hungry, so she started off w/ a bowl of onion soup.  I wished I could've had a taste- it looked so good!- but it contained an ingredient or two to which I'm still allergic, so I passed.  We both had a glass of wine each.  Friends later joined us, and so we placed an order of the frog legs ($8) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=WRlCnJLkxSKMeIBd-p5EiA#WRlCnJLkxSKMeIBd-p5EiA and an order of the turkey bruschetta ($10). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=XKgUUPNc5BtbWBATWY_2Ug#XKgUUPNc5BtbWBATWY_2Ug  When both appetizer plates arrived, I immediately placed a second order since 2 frog legs (although these were GIGANTIC frog legs- I'd hate to encounter these frogs in some Amazonian forest, that's for sure!) and two bruschetta slices just weren't going to cut it for the four of us!  The general consensus was that I was the only one in the bunch who would gladly order the frog legs again.  I did notice that the first order of frog legs was much crispier, and therefore better received, at least by moi, than the second plate.  We all loved the turkey bruschetta (pronounced w/ an "sh" instead of the hard "sk," but no worries- both pronunciations are correct, depending on the regions you find yourself in Italy, but wait, aren't we supposed to be in France??).  This app was basically a turkey salad (ala chicken salad) atop a mustard aioli and then garnished w/ fresh cranberry relish/compote.  I adored this dish!  So why the bittersweet memories?  Ah, well... a couple of things, really.  First, while I loved the romantic table we had by the fireplace outside, it did get chilly at the end, and I think that made Alison want to go home early.  I also had a chance to check out Petite Maison's all-wood interiors... very nice!  A few nestled-tables surrounding a beautiful and polished bar-counter.  Petite Maison is certainly a petite, and pretty, dining facility.  And what's my second bittersweet point?  Why, it's the wait till the next time I visit Petite Maison, of course!  I'll need to sock away a lot more francs before visiting again, though.  What?  You weren't expecting a juicy confession, now, were you?  ;)  Hope you enjoy the photos!

05/18/13  AZ Restaurant dinner #1 started out fair enough:  Received a voicemail from Sarah in the afternoon asking to confirm my reservation for later that evening.  Called to say I was indeed coming, but may arrive earlier and was told I would be accommodated for patio dining.  I checked in around 8:15p amidst a bustling patio setting and was relegated to the bar with a waiting time of around 15 minutes.  While looking through the wine menu, I decided I'd just eat at the bar.  Bartender Matthew was my server and obliged me with tastes of sauvignon and pinot blancs so that I may decide on a glass ($9) to accompany my three-course meal ($40).  After I'd ordered the pinot, and my prix fixe of soft shell crab, sea bass, and lemon curd tartelette, my complimentary cheese puff arrived. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=gX_2BIP2yqskNyxU9ugNmA#gX_2BIP2yqskNyxU9ugNmA  It was delicious, but not as great as I remembered it to be during the Julia Childs' dinner of Aug. '12.  What drew me in to include Petite Maison as one of my four dinners during AZ Restaurant Week, besides having eaten here many times before, was the menu's presentation.  Each course reflected a French fusion theme: the appetizer course had a French Asian twist (char sui pork jowls, or the soft shell crab tempura); the main was French Morroccan (sea bass, or roasted lamb leg), and dessert was French italian (nutella raviolis, or lemon curd tartelette).  A "French French" supplement of foie gras was also available for $14.  One of the advantages of Restaurant Week is the opportunity to try new restaurants that I haven't been able to visit before.  I also tend NOT to have dinner at a new place without first trying out the happy hour, and my daily routines and work schedule keep me from venturing out to places I've bookmarked for years, so when RW rolls around twice a year, I earmark new places, but upon seeing PM's menu, I decided to make it my first stop.  To say I was excited about my upcoming meal was putting it very mildly!  The soft shell crab was a beauty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=mjKPAlDj_Y00AGQKnz_QdQ#mjKPAlDj_Y00AGQKnz_QdQ  In fact, it was such a sight to behold, that a PM regular (Todd from Savannah, GA) sitting to my right also wanted to take a photo of it!  The dish smelled fantastic!  I ate this all up in a couple of minutes-- loved the yuzu aioli, which went well with the carrot-ginger slaw.  The ginger was divine!  The dish was well-balanced and not greasy at all.  Gaps between the courses were well-paced and soon, the sea bass arrived.  Matthew placed it down in front of me, hot and still wrapped in the parchment paper casing it was cooked in, and was about to cut and present it, when I asked him to pause for a moment so that I may take a "before" photo. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=K28gtY8lGIG2qRQ3PNzY3Q#K28gtY8lGIG2qRQ3PNzY3Q  When he finally broke the seal, the aromas that wafted out were enticing! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=hCVa6u5-AQBTrTxUOoZZTQ#hCVa6u5-AQBTrTxUOoZZTQ  However, after the necessary pics were taken and I had a couple of bites, I found the flavor of the fish very mild, and the cous cous, which was what made me want to order the dish, was also a bit bland to my liking.  The fish was cooked perfectly- and the veggies and cous cous were al dente.  The couple of twists of braised lemon I did in hopes to add more flavor didn't change the overall taste profile, but I finished the course anyway, since it was a small serving.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=tZt7FlNlSb0PAKpcGy5pJg#tZt7FlNlSb0PAKpcGy5pJg  The lemon curd tartelette wrapped up the prix fixe meal, but not before Matthew brought me a surprise- a short glass of muscat.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=SZPQ1zcCm84ITBJVIjCJ9A#SZPQ1zcCm84ITBJVIjCJ9A  Overall, I liked this pastry, even though I had a hard time cutting through the pastry shell each and every time.  The curd was very tangy and sweet, made sweeter by the honey drizzle, but the dollop of goat cheese did well to temper the sweet dish.    The nice glass of pinot blanc and tempura app were by far my faves tonight, and Matt obliging me with samples of wine before I ordered was appreciated, and I would've walked away with a 3.5 star experience until Matthew bade me goodbye saying "See you again next year on your once-a-year trip to Petite Maison."  He and Todd laughed, and I laughed along (I was buzzed), but what a very rude thing  to say!  By implying that I, or anyone for that matter, came to dine here only during RW to save money, Matt effectively wiped away everything that was satisfactory and made me wish I never went in the first place!  It takes only ONE person to ruin a guest's otherwise terrific experience, Chef Porter.  I hope you address this!  RW menu, wine, and tax $53.39 + $10 tip= $63.39

11/15/10  Terrace Cafe was a place I'd bookmarked weeks before my sister had mentioned hearing about its red velvet waffle from a coworker.  It sounded so delicious to her, she couldn't wait for us to try it!  Thank goodness her GPS system was cooperating that morning-- we found the parking garage easily.  Reaching the cafe proved a little bit tougher, even when I stopped to ask a security guard.  Or maybe we were just a little past the point of starving??  I really liked the entrance of the cafe, which had a nice-looking deli case full of specialty juices, pre-made salads, and dessert.  I really liked the energy here and was hoping we'd be able to sit at one of the two empty tables, but we were relegated to the back of the restaurant, where the energy was significantly muted (quite sleepy, actually), and the atmosphere there (from the large and dull wall paintings and dim lighting) made me think we were dining at a generic hotel chain restaurant after the buffet rush.  Service was very slow, as well, which I thought was odd, given that there was only one other occupied table besides ours.  After much deliberation as to what to order, we decided on the Red velvet waffle ($10), the California French toast ($10), a side of bacon ($3.50), and a side of two eggs, scrambled ($2.50).  We also ordered coffee for the table.  Mom and sister enjoyed their scrambled eggs, and we all liked the hash browns, extra-crispy on the outside by request, that I chose to accompany the waffle (options also included grits and fruit).  The bacon slices were thick-cut, wonderfully-crisped, and flavorful-- well-worth the $3.50 price tag.  Mom and I found the coffee to be very weak... Funny that sis and I were drawn to this place w/ the promise of earth-shattering delicious red velvet waffle, which she found to be boring, and I to be too fluffy and lacking of rich, chocolatey goodness, w/ its cream cheese drizzle proving to be too sweet to flip over this flop of a breakfast treat!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg?select=pwFY3czNmSCDkWIv9fK57g#pwFY3czNmSCDkWIv9fK57g  BUT there was a light at the end of the tunnel, and it was the California French toast!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg?select=_EKfF3-pgKDfq7Zup4NEdg#_EKfF3-pgKDfq7Zup4NEdg  This beauty of a dish consisted of three large slices of orange-scented French toast, which were drizzled w/ orange-infused honey and a side of wonderful cranberry butter!  I wished I'd ordered this, instead!  I wished I'd ordered anything other than that silly waffle!  But I digress... Really, the French toast is not to be missed.  I would, however, request for a crispier crust, should we ever return.

Much better than a Ross, IMO.  I actually enjoy walking around and looking at stuff, gathering Christmas gift ideas.  More organized than a Ross, that's evident.  Everything at Ross looks used, or disheveled...    Had to return an item I bought a few days ago and didn't run into any problems.

9/5/13  Stopped in to use an expiring $20 for $10 Amazon Local Deals coupon**.  Was told to sit anywhere I'd liked, so I sat at one of the tables near the windows overlooking the Ice Den, the ice-skating rink next door-- pretty cool. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=3vIs8mTZeROUqDL3yPzWpw#3vIs8mTZeROUqDL3yPzWpw  There were booths alongside one wall that had their own flat-screens, which were nice touches, and an area with leather (or was it pleather?) seating, and yet another flat-screen, which looked inviting.    The young female server wasn't particularly enthusiastic or helpful about the menu offerings, but was honest enough to steer me away from the sweet potato fries when I inquired about them.  I have to agree with her that the green chile mac 'n cheese was the better option out of the two.  After studying the menus for many minutes, debating on trying three courses (app, entree, and dessert), or just two main entrees, and finally decided on ordering the Bacon and blue cheese burger, with green chile mac to start, and then later on going with the cheeseburger (cheddar) and subbed sweet potato fries for an extra $1.25.  (Perhaps she's not a sweet potato fry fan, or maybe she is and she didn't like the way they were prepared here?  I had to find out for myself.)  The burger patties weren't of high-quality-- I found them consisting of more fillers than meat and too fatty, yet not very flavorful.  I had a bit of the blue cheeseburger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=KDB96IhpSqi3JgGvR259HQ#KDB96IhpSqi3JgGvR259HQ for lunch at work the next day, didn't enjoy it, and threw away the rest of both burgers that night.  Same thing with the sweet potato fries-- too soggy, even after I'd requested "extra-crispy," and not a lot of flavor.  The green chile mac was the only decent item I had.  Back to the burgers, I found it strange that the bacon and blue cheeseburger didn't come with any veggie trimmings ("only the cheeseburgers have them"), but I was given a plate of shredded lettuce and tasteless tomato slices when I asked.  The cheddar cheeseburger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=LXfGcKQ1Z9fFAPSKVkRYFQ#LXfGcKQ1Z9fFAPSKVkRYFQ did come with lettuce and, even more interestingly, more flavorful and redder, tomato slices.  The happy hour prices seem like a good deal, and it seems like a decent place to hang out and watch sports on TV, or to just  meet with friends, if hanging out at home, or someone else's, isn't feasible.  I thought it something novel to be able to watch both novice and experienced skaters practice next door...  I hope I can bump up my rating next time.  That is, if I return.  **Sister with two kids were coming for a visit in August, and I thought I'd take them ice-skating.  The kids weren't interested in trying on ice skates, so the certificate went unused.

4/7/10  Wanted to try this place back in March when Mom and I spotted an ad mentioning Filipino food in the plaza, but we'd already eaten pho, so had to wait until the next shopping opportunity brought us to this area again.  Met the very warm and friendly owners-- we really do wish them great success!  Since it was almost closing time, the food items in the buffet, and there weren't many to choose from, didn't look interesting, so we decided to try the pork skewers (the recipe of which the husband and wife team were very proud of), as well as the liempo (pork belly) serving that called out to Mom.  A combo plate of these two items also came with rice and achara (pickled papaya and carrots).  I also ordered one piece of saba at langka [saba bananas (or in this case, plantains) and jackfruit, wrapped in lumpia wrapper and deep-fried].  The wait for our food took longer than I expected, but it wasn't too much of an issue since Mom took awhile to do the groceries.  The wait, however, was worth it!  I really enjoyed the pork barbecue skewers- the flavors really took me back to my childhood in the Philippines, when street food, already a daily ritual for us then (and just now gaining popularity stateside) had us sampling BBQ, fried fishballs (and the many different sauces to dip them in!), steamed rolled rice and tuber pancakes, ripe and sour mangoes (the latter eaten with bagoong (very tiny salted shrimp) or vinegar and garlic, and "dirty" ice cream, to name a few from food carts that were to be seen all over Metro Manila and around colleges (grammar schools) and universities ("colleges" here).  Writing about those pork skewers actually make me want to stop at Mekong Plaza now, instead of going for Italian or French food I was considering earlier!  The liempo, on the other hand, I could've gone without; I remember thinking that we should've just ordered a double of the BBQ!  The skewers were just more flavorful than the pork belly pieces.  While Mom enjoyed the liempo, she did agree that the BBQ was were the money was at, and the owners really did have something to be proud of!  Let's not forget the dessert!  On second thought, maybe we should.  First, I didn't care for the presentation.  Take a gander at the photos, and you'll see what I mean.  Second, it wasn't very sweet.  Not even sweet enough.  See that pool of caramel sauce the turon rested on?  I did not leave a single drop on the plate!  Not because it was so delicious, but because the roll really needed the added punch.  Mom already knew it wasn't going to be anything to write home about, just by looking at the offering, but did wait till I took a couple of bites before saying "I should've just bought the ingredients at Mekong and made you those at home!"  My sentiments exactly, Mommy dearest!  Oh, but the pork BBQ!  Run and try some now!

11/02/10  Had an amazing happy hour, complete w/ dessert, here today!  Started off w/ red wine, an Apple salad, and Tuscan cheese board, and ended w/ a chocolate almond cake!  Service was quick and efficient, although it could've been a bit friendlier...  Don't know why they keep it so dark indoors-- 4:30p and it felt and looked like it was two hours later!  I've had the Apple salad a few times before, so it's a fave when I dine here.  It's the first time I've had the cheese board, though, and I loved it!  On the dinner menu for $9.95, it only cost me $6 during happy hour and was comprised of an aged goat, a pecorino, and a gorgonzola dolce, a garnish of apricot jam, some apple slices, red grapes, and bread rounds.  The gorgonzola was the creamiest of the three, and the most pungent-- LOVED it!  The aged goat was semi-soft, was easily spreadable on bread rounds, and paired well w/ the apricot jam the best.  The pecorino was the hardest of the three cheeses, the saltiest, and paired well w/ the granny smith apple slices and red grapes.  A well-rounded platter that satisfied all of the basic tastes (salty, sweet, sour. and bitter), minus the umami element.    The topper of this most excellent meal was the chocolate almond cake!  Alternating layers of almond-scented and chocolate cake, w/ layers of chocolate ganache between each cake layer, and then topped w/ more chocolate ganache, plus warm ganache on the plate, and sprinkled w/ toasted almonds!!  The almond cake layers were my favorite, as they definitely had the essence of almond throughout-- the chocolate layers didn't have any almond flavor at all.  I checked.  And checked again.  Nope-- the wonderful almond-goodness I enjoyed was in the light cake layers!  The warmed chocolate ganache and crunchy toasted almonds just sent me over the moon!  I'm so giddy now just thinking about it!  The photos included don't do this meal great justice.  BTW, I loved the cake so much, I ate that much AT THE TABLE.  I polished the rest off on the ride home!  :D

5/13/10  Simply amazing!!  Came in, and zeroed in on the two sliders up for sale at $2 each during happy hour.  These were the most-flavorful sliders, offering up the best mouth-feel (due to the aiolis and the focaccia bread they're sandwiched in), I've had in a very long time, possibly ever!  I'm kicking myself as I type this review for not ordering more (I had only one of each)!    The only complaint I had was that service was a complete opposite of what I experienced the first time around (when I had Clayton as my server).  I'd say that the whole time I was at the bar, I probably only spoke to my server (and I mean to say that she only visited and spoke to me) maybe three times- the first to greet and ask me what I wanted (I asked for water and also her suggestions for well drinks, and she didn't have many ideas to give); the second for my order and ticket in a glass ready to close; and the third for other possible selections I might want before closing the ticket.  A total 180 degrees from the excellent service showered on me by Clayton (props to you!).  If I haven't been back to have more of these terrific sliders, I'd have to say it was bec. of the lukewarm service I experienced this afternoon.  What initially was a five-star review I must drop down to four.  Maybe next time, I'll be lucky enough to spot Clayton tending bar...

1/30/10  Came in for dinner.  My second time at this location (the first was when it was the newly-transferred Digestif during Yelp Eats Week).  What a great transformation from a dark, smoky venue to a warmer, much-more inviting space- thanks to those b/w and prismatic floor tiles!  My EXCELLENT meal consisted of table bread and basil olive oil; the marvelous and perfectly cooked flat-iron steak, medium to medium-rare (cauliflower, golden raisin salsa verde); and the stupefyingly-addiciting puff pastry Chef Charleen created that night w/ AZ pecans, vanilla ice cream, and Wild Turkey caramel sauce (corn-free!!).  I had to muster up all of my willpower to sock-away half of the steak (the raisin salsa verde made this dish a winner!) for my Mom to try at home (she's hard-to-please, but LOVED the leftovers), so that I could demolish the pastry creation :)  [I just recently found out I'm allergic to pecans, but y'know, this dish is so good, I'd definitely keep it in mind on my next visit when considering my dessert options!]  While still enjoying in the aftermath of such a wonderful meal, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my table ticket arrived w/ a small chunk of homemade toffee crunch.  However, this lovely-looking sweet contained an allergen or two, so Charleen switched it w/ a two-bite chocolate chocolate chip cookie.  What a sweet way to wish me good night!  Yelp Eats/Restaurant Week, where are you??

11/30/10  2.5 stars.  Came for happy hour, but didn't find anything on the happy hour food menu I wanted to try, so I ordered a medium Emilia Romagna pizza (mozzarella, parmesan, and 12-year balsamic vinegar- Aceto Balsamico).  Can't recall what the price was on this pizza, but it was probably around the $14 range.  The pizza came a bit too charred on the bottom, and the very thin-crust didn't stay crispy for very long, perhaps just 5 minutes, and definitely soggy by the 10-minute mark.  While I enjoyed the slice I had at the restaurant, the leftovers proved to be too salty when I tried to re-heat the pizza at home, so I had to toss the rest- not economical for the price, I'm sorry to say.  I only ate a slice at Fred's, bec. I wanted to try the cobbler-of-the-day, which was the apple cobbler topped w/ Haagen-Daaz ice cream (if I recall correctly).  Had to order it sans powdered sugar (corn allergy), and I found it good, and not too sweet.  I'd try their other cobblers, too, if they didn't come at a high cost ($9, plus the ice cream has corn syrup in it- corn allergy).  I'd also like to try the profiteroles, but they, too, come w/ a $9 tag, which means $4.50 per profiterol- I believe I'd asked how many came in a dish and was quoted two...  Don't be fooled by the scowl that the bouncer-type bartender constantly has on his face-- he actually was nice to talk to, at least the first time I spoke to him.  A couple of friends and I went there after a mixer about a month ago, and he was unapproachable, and projected himself to be too busy to do more than to come over and take our order.  No hellos and how-are-yous that night- such a big turn-off, and w/ a high-priced menu, I don't think I'll come by again.  (I originally was going to rate 3 stars, but type it up as 2.5, but now that I've finished w/ my review, I'm going to go w/ 2 stars.  I wish you better experiences here yourself!)

Came here for National pancake day where you may donate dollars for the free short stack of plain buttermilk pancakes.  Added hash browns and an egg, but my server forgot to add the egg order.  I reminded him of the omission after a few minutes and told him I didn't want it anymore, but a manager brought one over, anyway.  Hash browns were OK, crisped the way I requested it, but the pancakes tasted very sweet, and I hadn't even added any of the syrup I'd brought, not like any other kind of pancake I've had at local breakfast places, such as Good Egg, Snooze, Soul Cafe, and even U.S. Egg.  I ate one at the restaurant, and took the leftovers home, but they turned rubbery the next day and was inedible.  I could taste the sugar left on my teeth when I tried to take a bite...  I won't be back for the free pancakes, but perhaps, in a pinch*, I could have more of the crispy hash browns, bacon, and eggs.  *Thanks to Jeffery A., who made me realize I didn't have to throw the  baby out with the bath water!

5/19/10  2.5 stars.  Didn't really care for the interior, and the tables outside weren't beckoning, either.  It was very antiseptic and cold indoors, with only the menu handwritten on the chalkboard, the plain-looking pastry display case (devoid of any ornamentation or even a sign of any effort in making everything inside presentable), and, what looked to me, an antique-looking espresso machine on the counter to lend decoration to the all-white interior.  It was also very noisy indoors, despite the fact that there were only a handful of people!    Ordered the Mascarpone and fig jam on marble rye ($4) and the Lox w/ cream cheese and tomato ($8 or $9), as well as a latte, no sugar.  The coffee came in a paper cup... why?  Made me feel like she wanted me to leave.  Loved the mascarpone and fig!  (So much so, I soon acquired a jar of organic fig jam from Whole Foods, but I need to find good marble rye toast...)  The lox, however, was disappointing.  While I found the flavors palatable, I thought the lox strips were too thin (I had lox at True Foods Kitchen that were wild-caught and larger for only a couple of dollars more), and the cream cheese rectangles looked strange with its right angles (after seeing such a lovely presentation done w/ the Mascarpone and fig jam).  Made me wish I'd had two sets of the toast!  It was nice to see that they still roasted the coffee beans on-site.  I wish nothing but success to Toast, but I won't be going back-- at least not for a good long while...

02/04/10  Happy hour w/ Violeta.  Loved the furniture (dark wood and slightly reminiscent of old Mission churches or Spanish villas that one may find back home- I'm from the Philippines), and the ambience.  I liked how the doors/paneling opened up to a patio- it was a little chilly that afternoon, but I imagine that w/ the perfect weather we have now, happy hour at TLR would FEEL nice.  What I did not like about the LR is that it was NOISY.  Now, I didn't mind so much that the music selections were eclectic (country to jazz to classic rock, and even Motown); After all, we were AT The Living Room, and, as in different households, one can find different music playing.  No, it was just too noisy.  I'd hate to imagine what conversing would be like if the doors opening up to the patio were closed...  What I also noticed was that while there were smatterings of all age groups (there were even children running around in the patio!), most of the people there were in their mid-40s to mid-50s.  I usually check out happy hours at restaurants for the food offered, and not to meet potential love interests, and this venue would definitely be somewhere I'd just go for the food MYSELF.  I can't even picture being able to do some work on my laptop here... maybe it'll be different in a few months?  Service was a little bit lacking, but the place was packed!  A chair was even taken from our table (I didn't mind, but I think V. did, since she was keeping her fingers crossed that her hubby would join us).  As for the food, we were going to keep it light by ordering bruschetta.  (I knew that TLR was affiliated w/ Scottsdale's 5th & Wine, and I had tried and enjoyed the bruschetta there.)  The bread pieces here were sliced much thicker than those at 5th, and while they may have reminded me of Postino's bruschetta, the flavors, while good enough that I enjoyed the dish, made me wish I was at Postino's, or even at 5th & Wine.  Especially when it was so noisy we had to raise our voices to hear each other; Violeta wasn't enjoying the music; and children were running around not two feet away from me.  I would like to give TLR another chance, and hopefully, my guests and I will find a younger crowd (no children present, please!) to enjoy the ambience, music, and food with.

4/11/10  I've eaten here twice already, and I love this place!  Easily five stars, but a few things keep me from rating so...  One reason is that I'm not that enamored of the vibe here- feels a little too much like a meat market, maybe?  Perhaps the atmosphere's a little too "dark" (gloomy/goth-y)?  Tiny details which, for now, do not prevent me from wanting to go back and try something new from the menu!  On my first visit (late March/early April), I sat at the bar and was served by a very patient and helpful bartender whose name now escapes me.  (Sorry!)  However, he did steer me to the right direction on this visit by suggesting I try the Kurobuta Pork Ribs (and on the next visit with the Fried Chicken)!  I thought it funny that one of his pork ribs' selling points was that it was cooked in a sous vide-- sorry I kind of rained on your parade when I knew what a sous vide was.  (Thanks to episodes of Iron Chef America and fellow Yelper Joel L.'s cool blog at onefordinner.com!)  Hey!  You had me at "no, it doesn't contain mustard."  (I asked.)    Woohoo!  It's been a long time since I had BBQ pork ribs, and this platter was worth waiting for!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=i3AkQGxtvOCETdQWiiPMCw#i3AkQGxtvOCETdQWiiPMCw  Great flavors and fall-off-the-bone tender pork...  The dish is usually paired with fries, but I asked if I could sub coleslaw, instead.  Oh my God, the slaw here is incredible!  (I wish they sold jars of coleslaw to take home.)  Needless to say, I ate the whole thing!  But was I done eating?  No!  I had to have something sweet, so I ordered the Apple Monkey Bread.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=LJSG9mQ0OJ0Hg11nLf_PAg#LJSG9mQ0OJ0Hg11nLf_PAg  Again, another winner!  I would've preferred a higher apple content (and less bread), but that's more of a preference than a fault in execution.  Loved the vanilla bean ice cream pairing, as well!  On my second visit, I ordered the Fried Chicken, which, according to the menu, comes with a buttermilk biscuit and honey drizzle.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=KVajeeB3_N2SYylwQpxOSQ#KVajeeB3_N2SYylwQpxOSQ  I asked for an extra plate so that I could share the food with Mom.  When the food finally arrived*, we were pleasantly surprised that the kitchen split the food onto two plates for us... so cool!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=C538acZVs3swVhHCQ0vwmA#C538acZVs3swVhHCQ0vwmA  LOVED the fried chicken!  The batter coating treatment was perfect- very light, yet so crispy and not too greasy.  The biscuits were small, but perfect size for the amount of chicken we received.  I would've liked the biscuit to be a little flakier, but other than that, I liked my piece.  I personally loved the honey drizzle on the chicken, but Mom didn't.  (I told her to just take the coating off.  After awhile, I asked her to just give the rest of her chicken!  LOL.)  I really enjoyed what little of the garlic mashed potatoes I tried, and so did Mom!  (Thank goodness the potatoes made the grade with her, because the honeyed chicken didn't, and now I can't get her to go back to CD....)  Cannot wait for my next visit!  The prime rib dip and bistro steak are calling my name :)  [I hear from a foodie coworker that the salmon is not bad, either!]  *I wonder how the crusty bread tastes like?  I spied quite a few sitting on a counter on my way back from the restroom.  Haven't tried the bread yet, because CD charges $2 for a serving.  Why charge for table bread?  Does anyone else find this practice off-putting?

07/14/10 and 10/14/10!  (What a coincidence!  I did not plan the 3-month interval...)  My first visit to T'GF was for Bastille Day, when Jeff K. and his food truck had a "taste-off" against Torched Goodness.  I found them both to be equally good that day, although Jeff was a little more generous w/ his frozen dessert sample compared to TG's thimble sample (TG was out of the two flavors I wanted to try)!  Since I couldn't decide which was better of the two, I didn't vote... Sorry, Jeff K.!  I decided to try the Bastille Day dessert crepe, expecting I'd get a traditional crepe w/ vanilla ice cream.  Instead, I received a cup filled w/ ice cream and garnished w/ a sliver of a cookie and, I'd like to say, a raspberry coulis.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/truckin-good-food-phoenix?select=fOquGJdYwCwC7S489g_E9g#fOquGJdYwCwC7S489g_E9g  Delicious, but a bit too sweet!  (Yes, yes, Jeff K. did describe to me what I was going to receive before preparing my order, but I'd just had a sample of flan, which contains egg, of which I'm allergic to, that has many side effects, one of which is a lack of concentration!  Come to think of it, the ice cream probably consisted of eggyolks, as well.)  My second visit to T'GF left me being a happier camper!  I had already checked out the website's menu and had two items in mind, but was sidetracked into ordering frites (potato fries cooked in duck fat).  I placed my order of a Brittany crepe, as well as one beignet, no powdered sugar.  After a few minutes, I'd remembered it was the panisse frites (chickpea fries) that I'd wanted to try, so I asked Jeff if it was too late to change my mind.  No, it wasn't too late!  Since there was a line of people before me waiting for their crepes to be prepared (I think they can only make two crepes at a time back there), I opted to pop inside Downtown PHX Public Market and have a go at the menu, as well.  Stop the presses!  The Brittany crepe was tres magnifique!  It consisted of a buckwheat crepe filled w/ local Buckeye, AZ Crow's Dairy chevre, as well as a little buckwheat honey.  Food orgasm!  I'm definitely going to order this one again on my next visit!  The panisse frites were OK, albeit very, very mild-tasting.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/truckin-good-food-phoenix?select=svrAe4tRWFasRDLOHa6RIw#svrAe4tRWFasRDLOHa6RIw  While deep-fried, they weren't greasy at all.  They reminded me a bit of falafel, though definitely not as dense (far from it!) nor as flavorful as falafel.  I didn't find the light-as-air lemon-herb froth that accompanied the fries punchy enough to pair well w/ the crispy fries :(  Perhaps a creamier dip would suffice?  The curry mayo (which came w/ a fellow Yelper's frites) was a better match.  As for the beignet-- it looked delicious, but I couldn't try it since Jeff's assistant forgot to hold the powdered sugar.  Boo!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/truckin-good-food-phoenix?select=GCdX9u-msiqKqim1A2B4-A#GCdX9u-msiqKqim1A2B4-A Sorry for not having a photo of the Brittany crepe-- once I'd had a taste of it, I didn't want to pause to turn on my camera phone.  (I figured I could always take one the next time I visit!  Hahaha!)  I bumped into Yelpers Dolores, Robyn, and Lynn, who later accepted my invitation to sit at my table and so was able to sample Robyn's frites w/ curry dip (the same dip I'd picked out initially before changing my mind!)  They're pretty good!  Thanks, Robyn!  BTW, thanks for the feedback on the beignet and its "super-yummy" caramel sauce!

Violeta and I met here two days ago, and I really enjoyed it!  We only had a couple of hours to look around, since I had school after, but I really did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did.  Great exhibits- although I wish those that had a larger number of items in the collection would get more space to have a less cluttered showcase.  I need to go back a few more times (or spend two or three long visits) to be able to see everything.  I do not know how large this building is, or even how many rooms/sections it has, but I have a feeling I just saw the tip of the iceberg...    $15 for adult admission seemed a bit steep in the beginning, but after spending only two hours there, I'd say the trip was worth it!  The fact that you get headsets that are synched with switch boxes as you move from one area to another makes the adult admission a great value!  I don't know if the starting "donation" fee of $250 for an annual membership is going to win me over though...   To you Hard Rock/guitar fans out there, you will want to check out the MiM's lovely collections, and not just the ones on the main level (lovely display by the stairs).  I'm still pretty blown away with the collection of boat lutes of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines on the upper level! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wWhq9cKLCrZHcp-ezp-hPQ?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  (Psst- they're mostly from the Philippines.)  Speaking of the P.I., check out the beautifully "tabo" drum at the bottom level http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wWhq9cKLCrZHcp-ezp-hPQ?select=qprllSNHvFkPQMoLLXcfEw - when I see intricate wood carvings, such as what were on that drum, they get me thinking back to my childhood when almost all the woodwork I saw were lovely like that.  Mahogany, some were of dark honey, a lot of shiny, burled wood.  Ahh... I saw them everywhere back home.  Here, I only get to see them in high-end magazines, mansions, and museums.  If we only appreciated how wonderfully grand our lives where back home...)

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!  12/10/15 Came in for my first detail experience.  Called in earlier to find out what the wait times looked like, and the woman on the phone said there wasn't a wait.  Took me half an hour to drive over, and there was one couple waiting for their car ahead of me.  I am not positive, but I think we were the only two customers there at the time.  I was given a 20- to 30-minute wait time, but the wait ran to AT LEAST 45 minutes, with my having to call my next appointment to let them know I'd be late.  I decided I'd try Francis & Sons after seeing their three Ultimate Washes offer for $44, regularly $28 each, on Groupon.  I knew from reading the Yelp reviews of the different F&S locations that the salespeople will try to upsell, so I wasn't surprised that the rep would offer me "deals."  I told him I was there for an Ultimate Wash (UW), and he told me I was in luck because the UWs were discounted at $23 that day.  FYI...  Ultimate Wash ($28) is "VIP wash+ Cream Conditioner- applied to dash, doors, and console, Exterior Dressing- applied to all plastic." VIP Wash ($20) is "Works wash+ Triple Foam Polish, Interior Dressing, Underbody Wash."   Works Wash ($16) is "Basic wash+ Tire Shine, Air Freshener, Clear Coat Protectant." Basics wash ($13) is "Vacuum, Towel Dry, Clean Glass, Dust Dash."  The sales guy saw that I had carpet stains, and he offered to clean all four carpet areas and include the UW for $50.  I didn't know if this was a good deal, so I hesitated and told him I didn't have much time, that I had to be elsewhere at 230 pm, and that I wanted the console to be vacuumed, as well, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/francis-and-sons-car-wash-tempe-3?select=hloClBCRFd65lBqanlx4mQ so he offered to clean one stained area (behind the driver seat) for $8.  I said OK**, and I went into the lobby and went ahead and paid for the services.***  I think about three, or four sets of customers came in after me.  Not busy, at all.  Not like the location at Via Linda, which I came to find out the next day...  Anyway, I was already late for my original massage appointment, but was able to secure another session without consequences (no lost time, no extra fees), but I didn't have much time to look over the results at F&S, and I'm sure everyone here knew this, because the lobby is a small area, and I had made two calls to the massage place, of which one I know the receptionist overheard, since I was also asking said receptionist questions on how to get to Apache Ave from F&S, while I tried to let the massage receptionist know I might be late getting there.  (Also, the sales guy was in-and-out of the lobby, speaking with the receptionist, at least three times- it was a slow afternoon.)  Note-- always make sure you have time to double- and triple-check the work these employees do!  I only had time to notice that the trunk's carpet had not been vacuumed, so the guy who attended to my car started vacuuming there, while I went to check out the shampooed area, which looked clean at first glance.  It was only when I had gotten out of massage a couple of hours later did I notice that the shampoo had caused the stain to spread out to a larger area, and the mat covering up the stain had not been cleaned.  The console space was vacuumed a little bit, but there were still a LOT of crumbs left, and the mat at the bottom of the console wasn't even brushed clean! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/francis-and-sons-car-wash-tempe-3?select=tNxgD8ShLo4VnAX0wtj_xg  As far as I could see, I spent one UW voucher and $8 to get a "fair to poor" vacuum job of the console, a good-to-fair vacuuming of the four carpet areas, and a wipe down of the dusty dashboard.  However, the areas around my glove compartment and the console still had beverage and food stains!  As you can see from the photos I've posted, the exterior looked like it hadn't even been washed, much less wiped. I found dirt everywhere, and water spots and stains all over.  Most of these exterior marks would've been cleaned at a Costco car wash station for $8.  I even wiped dust off of the top of my right side mirror!  And to think I overtipped the guy.****   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/francis-and-sons-car-wash-tempe-3?select=Skf3hWuuAqEPvHDg6PR_kA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/francis-and-sons-car-wash-tempe-3?select=m77jCDYA86GrZMeP1k_spA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/francis-and-sons-car-wash-tempe-3?select=0fpCehD63518JlMA9nKuLQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/francis-and-sons-car-wash-tempe-3?select=y6pNMCnda8TZ2i4xLG6jkw  I CANNOT and WILL NOT recommend this Kyrene Rd. Francis & Sons location to anyone, and I suggest you look elsewhere!    **Mistake #1.   ***Mistake #2.  Don't pay until after checking for missed spots/areas! ****I shouldn't have tipped any more cash!

12/15/10  Cool bright, happy colors w/ a hippy-chic atmosphere.  Enticing-looking natural "treats" everywhere you look- cupcakes, brownies, cookies, energy bars, and fruits.  There seemed to be only one cook and one cashier/helper that day of my first and only visit (so far!), both eager to be of help w/ my questions on the ingredients of their fare.    The coffee, though expensive (or so I thought, at $3 a cup, no refills), was very good, and came w/ a tiny bit of homemade cranberry-pistachio biscotti- delicious!  I enjoyed the Berry Pepita French toast, which consisted of bread made w/ a house seed mix, and loaded w/ raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries, plus slices of kiwi, apple, and garnishes of grapefruit!  I believe PC offered blue agave syrup as their pancake syrup, but I didn't need it, as the fruit provided most of the sweetness I needed.  (I did whip out reserve bottle of 100% maple syrup from my bag...)  This gratifying breakfast kept me full, w/out feeling bloated, for more than seven hours!  Why I haven't returned, which I promised myself I would the next couple of days, I don't know... Perhaps on my next "weekend" off!

10/06/12  Thank you Pomegranate Cafe, Russell, and all of PC's other staff members for helping me forget, for an hour or so, that I was feeling very much under-the-weather.  l was feeling elated about my upcoming delights, I totally forgot how awful I must have looked wearing yoga pants, a Life is Good tee, a hooded zip pullover, and glasses.  What a bum!  Surprisingly, business was bustling this morning-- I've never seen PC full of people, and get this, there was a LINE waiting to order!  Because most of the tables were taken indoors, it was very noisy, so I took this chance to hide my I'm-sick-as-a-dog bum from the beautiful people and eat OUTDOORS.  But first, I had to place my order.  Since I'd already perused the menu online, I knew I was going to have the French toast, no powdered sugar, please, like I usually do, but I wanted to try something new.  The basic breakfast (egg, toast, jam, and fruit) enticed, but I quickly drew towards Kamut toast, almond butter, jam, and fruit.  I also thought I'd either try a smoothie or an elixir ($8 each), but the menu online stated to ask for an elixir menu for options.  There was only one, and it was a "female hormonal concoction" with something, I lost track, since I didn't need help with my hormones, thank you very much.  ("Not that there's anything wrong with that.")  $8 saved.  The smoothie I wanted to try contained pomegranate juice, which I correctly suspected had one or more unwanted ingredients, and for me, that was "grape seed oil extract."  (So glad I spotted those juice bottles in front of the cash register.)  Good- I was able to hang onto $8 of my money.  Last, but not least, I ordered a cappucino (Cartel Coffee) and a glass of water without cucumber.  I again reiterated that I did not want powdered sugar on the French toast, which I was told would take twenty or twenty-five minutes to be ready, since they'd run out of the bread and the next batch was in the oven.  I said it was worth waiting for, so I don't mind, and besides, I'll have the kamut toast and almond butter.  As I paid for my three items, I was told that my food will be out in about 30 minutes, which took me by surprise, but I was in no mood to make a fuss, especially when I needed to secure an empty table before someone else snatched it!  I found one outdoors, but it needed bussing.  No problem, as I found a shy and cute associate to help me.  One thing I really like about frequenting vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free venues, is how most, if not all, of the staff members are so humble, and are good-natured.  Another thing is that these venues tend to look so hippy-chic, colorful, eclectic, and FUN!  I loved the different swaths of colorful curtains, brightly-painted tables and chairs, whimsical dinnerware, and that was indoors!  Outside, I found a mosaic two-top with mismatched chairs- I sat on the one without the morsel of food on its seat.  The food didn't take quite as long as 30 minutes.  The cappucino http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=b5c0q6siFAHnRWC5FU3TYw#b5c0q6siFAHnRWC5FU3TYw took a few minutes to arrive, and so did the lovely-tasting city water, nicely contained in a lidless canning jar.  (There's a reason cucumber slices are used to "flavor" the water, folks!)  It was about ten minutes after I started sipping my coffee that the Banana bread French toast arrived http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=ZPZ8wSo4IPOrtAmFWejCcw#ZPZ8wSo4IPOrtAmFWejCcw, but it was sprinkled with powdered sugar!  However, Russell did not hesitate in taking it back and bringing another.  What terrific service!  The Kamut toast, almond butter, jam, and fruit plate stayed, however, so I was happy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=s3KbSXITa6YEFvYgGYv91g#s3KbSXITa6YEFvYgGYv91g  Still happy, even when I found out that the almond butter was the raw variety-- I don't particularly like its flavor, or lack thereof, and I only buy and enjoy the roasted kind.  It's a good thing I am not allergic to chia (still experimenting), sesame, and sunflower seeds, for while the menu did not mention these were included, one certainly could not avoid their presence on this dish!  It's also a good thing they were, since they gave the bland-tasting almond butter much-needed flavor.  The fun textures on this dish also gave my mouth something to be happy about!  The Banana bread French toast arrived about 5 minutes later, and what a marvel that was! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=vfafsHCzso2InWi-kcDWBg#vfafsHCzso2InWi-kcDWBg  The French toast had the PERFECT crunch on the outside, a gorgeous pound-cake-meets-angel-cake consistency on the inside, and a wonderful roasted-banana scent filled the air around my face that soon delighted my taste buds!  The strawberry-rhubarb jam and agave pancake syrup added lovely velvety coats of sweetness and colors, as well.  I could've eaten the entire dish!  I'll be back!

Attended SpaFitFinder.com's launch/AZ's Finest Honoree benefitting the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation tonight.  The event itself seemed successful (the bar was packed, the service was s-l-o-w, but understandable); however, no one from SpaFitFinder came around to introduce himself/herself and to elaborate on the site's services.  Indeed, the server who handled V's and my drinks all night (a $10 per person netted donatee drink coupons for a mojito- d'lish!- and a beer/wine, and a sweet goody bag*) wore a SpaFitFinder shirt, but did not offer up any info on its services, neither.  While I wouldn't ever go back to the bar (TOO NOISY- I NEVER like to SHOUT at the person sitting next to me to be heard), or order the $11 turkey club again [this was a basic deli sandwich made w/ turkey, cranberry chutney mayo, smoked bacon (mmm... bacon!), avocado slices, and alfalfa sprouts on toasted Hawaiian bread, but it's nothing to write home about); had V and I gone to FEZ w/ the $11, we would've been in heaven munching on a delicious burger and some perfect sweet potato fries!), but I may give Urban 7 Martini Kitchen a second chance to redeem itself on the food a foodie coworker of mine RAVED about.  I can say the martinis I had were good.  Loved the mojito and the Inhibition -something (vodka, peach schnapps, and cranberry juice, minus the cranberry juice, and instead, club soda and sour).  Didn't care for the house pinot grigio.  I will say that the jalapeno and olive tapenade bruschetta and the grilled marinated skirt steak skewer were tasty... (FYI, the noise level was a lot lower at the resto, but the band, while they played pleasing music, did get loud at the end.  Also, the service was quicker.  Appreciated the fact that our server was honest in telling me that he hadn't tried the dessert I'd asked him about.  Other less-conscientious servers would've gushed about how it was their fave item off the menu to make the sale.  Kudos to Anthony!)  *Among the goody bag offerings were an 8 oz. Philosophy foaming bath and shower cream (easily $8 retail), trial-size facial products, a wine stopper/pourer, a 20% off food/drink at Urban 7, and a $20 off coupon for Yelper John H.'s massage services!  Nice :)

03/23/10  I've postponed writing this review until now, bec. I quite frankly didn't know how to come off unbiased, because, surprise!, my whole meal was comped!  Had I paid for my selections, I'd still give this review at least four stars.  At least!  Happy hour menu made its debut on my first (and so far only) visit to RnR.  Yay!!  There were select small plates from the regular menu listed (ahi tacos, chicken lollipops, animal fries, and a special: $10 Burger 'n Brew, to name a few).  Sean was friendly, very helpful and patient w/ all my allergy concerns, and he was at my side almost the whole time I was there- I even asked if he wasn't needed elsewhere since it was starting to get really busy outside.  As I waited for my animal fries (half sweet potato fries and half white smothered w/ white cheddar (?) and a dollop of BBQ shredded pork on top!) to arrive, I asked if I'd be able to order the Burger 'n Brew w/ a glass of wine subbed for the brew (since I don't drink beer), and I was first told no, but then yes, but w/ a dollar or two upcharge.  I decided I'd go w/ the upcharge and put my order in for the burger.  The fries came, and I was in heaven!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z_JkVkaUcN4ITVeuG-4Qtw?select=_oGqaO_0-fNGTCLl1T-j4w#_oGqaO_0-fNGTCLl1T-j4w  The sweet potato fries were fried very crisp- the way I like 'em!  Loved the combo of melted cheese and shredded pork w/ both fry varieties.  A def. must-try!  I really wanted to order the artichoke dip, instead of the burger, but I couldn't have corn tortilla chips (corn allergy), but a presenter (?) from the kitchen offered to switch them out for parmesan chips and told me he'd take care of me, which I took to mean that I'd soon have the app delivered.  When my server came back, I asked him if it was too late to cancel the burger since I was going to get the artichoke app instead, and he said it was not a problem.  Lo, and behold, the "app" placed in front of me was a small sampling of the dip and chips.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z_JkVkaUcN4ITVeuG-4Qtw?select=INeFdqEUMxCESgK6bn9jAw#INeFdqEUMxCESgK6bn9jAw  (FYI, this dip was VERY good!)  By this time, I was getting full on the animal fries, the dip, the parmesan chips (although I couldn't really taste the parmesan), and the glass of wine, and I was mentally computing what my bill was going to be, when the burger was delivered to my table!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z_JkVkaUcN4ITVeuG-4Qtw?select=Ncy-WbRbKGqpjM0S8dsQ0A#Ncy-WbRbKGqpjM0S8dsQ0A  I told the presenter that I had canceled the order, but he left it anyway.  My server again came to see how I was, and even he was surprised to see the burger there.  After going to the kitchen/back to see what to make of this, he came back and said I was welcome to try it if I still wanted to, but that the burger would be on the house.  Yay!!  This was a wonderful burger, too, and not just bec. it was on the house!  Loved the thick-cut quality and the crisp, yet not overcooked bacon.  The burger patty was juicy and cooked to medium (but still pink in the center).  Perfect!  I'd order this again!  When it came time to pay up, I asked Sean what the damages were, expecting a ticket for the fries and glass of wine, but Sean smiled and said "Umm... guess it's on the house!"  Eyes bulging, lower jaw hitting the counter table, I was stunned!  "What?"  I couldn't see any reason why, and besides, how was I going to charge his tip if I didn't have a check??  I really had to dig into my purse pockets and wallet to find bills to tip him with (I rarely carry cash).  But Irish luck befell Sean (isn't Sean an Irish name?) when I spotted a business card holder on the bottom of my purse (women w/ big bags, y'know what I mean), filled w/ bills stored there many, many moons ago and were forgotten until that day.  I wished I had more to give that day, Sean!    Am glad to finally place this review here, bec. now I know where to take Mom for breakfast in a few days!  The Southwest Biscuits and Gravy, the Chambord French toast, and a maple bacon scone, plus good coffee and even $1 sipping chocolate (??) are calling OUR names!  :)  p.s.  LOVED the atmosphere!  Really liked the dark woods and red paint.  (There's a wall in the main room where the paint has a glossy finish on top- love that look!)  The two levels really piqued my curiosity.  Wonder what the view looks like from up there?  Hmm... Maybe I'll just stick to the main dining room...

06/02/10 Very good breakfast today!  Took Mom for her first visit here (my second).  It was around 11a, but so quiet-- only one other table w/ two guys.  Kind of sad, that.  Service was helpful, if not a little spotty at the end...  Took awhile to get our table check-- I had to stand up and look for him...  We loved the coffee cups here!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z_JkVkaUcN4ITVeuG-4Qtw?select=7iNM1Pusno5Th6qUrj-e4w#7iNM1Pusno5Th6qUrj-e4w  They were just so whimsical, and y'know, it's the little details that can make a dining experience fun.  I already knew which items to try since I've been eyeing the menu online for quite sometime now.  I asked for the maple and bacon scone http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z_JkVkaUcN4ITVeuG-4Qtw?select=jNyDe13yh05tveWB4qQXLw#jNyDe13yh05tveWB4qQXLw, made in-house, as well as the biscuits and gravy http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z_JkVkaUcN4ITVeuG-4Qtw?select=gnHMYRKpHFb-a57YmIMOmg#gnHMYRKpHFb-a57YmIMOmg and some French toast.  (I initially wanted to get the Chambord French toast, but Mom isn't a fan of raspberry (I am!), so I conceded to her fondness for strawberries. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Z_JkVkaUcN4ITVeuG-4Qtw?select=K92AT-3LsTyj61klFadkEw#K92AT-3LsTyj61klFadkEw  The scone was a runaway hit!!  I hope to return to RnR very soon (lest it closes for lack of business!) so that I may order a scone to eat at the resto, and a couple more to take to work!  I could've just had the scone and coffee for breakfast and be happy :), but we both do love our biscuits and gravy, and I wanted to compare these to Daily Dose's.  I thought they were tasty, but definitely a "7" to DD's "10" (10 being the highest, flavor-wise), but for the cost, you can't beat Daily Dose's value.  Mom took a few forkfuls, and declared them subpar.  We both didn't care much for the strawberry French toast.  The bread was too fluffy w/out any crunch factor, with only fresh-sliced berries and whipped cream.  Too simple for us.  Where was the rich sweetened cream?  A big disappointment.  I hope to try the Chambord version very soon!  Perhaps I should rate this review w/ only 3 stars, but we really did like the novel dishes (I think the utensils even had the hammered look that I really like!).  The coffee tasted good, too!  And the scone!!  Oh my goodness... I don't care if they're laden w/ buttah- I need to have some more pronto!

10/01/13  Came in to use a Local Dines certificate expiring tonight.  It being a Tuesday, I could've taken advantage of their bruschettas, cheese and charcuterie plates, and beverage specials (wine and other beverages) offered on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 7p to close, but since I had a discounted certificate, I had to postpone trying these out until another time.  Instead, I decided to check out a couple of RnR's burgers and a pint of Angry Orchard cider ($6).  The cider was served very cold (perfect after I slipped a koozie on the glass) and tasted "mah-velous, absolutely mah-velous!"  Server Sibby/Siby was friendly and upbeat, as well as patient with all my questions regarding the food and beverage menus, as well as a few concerns I had regarding ingredients on a few dessert items.  Not once did she make me feel like I was a burden.  I wouldn't hesitate to ask to be seated at her tables!  Not only was Sibby a delight to have as a server, but she was also a great help in steering me towards the right direction when I asked her which of the two was better, sweet potato fries or tots (she said tots; I asked if I could go half-and-half, and she said yes) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=8z6nhnprgC3psPCRuAiH-Q#8z6nhnprgC3psPCRuAiH-Q, as well as my checking out the Bacon Brussels Burger, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=46gN0ZHqMW8--oYt-Y5I_w#46gN0ZHqMW8--oYt-Y5I_w which would still taste great without the raspberry demi glace (which contained cornstarch, an ingredient I'm allergic to).  This burger tasted wonderful!  Made with jarlsberg cheese, applewood bacon, fried Brussels sprouts, onion jam, and a pretzel bun, this burger was definitely sweeter in flavor (due to the toastiness of the sprouts, as well as the addition of the onion jam- heaven!) and made for an agreeable contrast after the few bites I had of the Southwest Burger.  The salty (but in a good way!), pleasing number consisted of pepperjack cheese, chopped green chiles, smoked bacon, crispy onion straws, and a garlic aioli, nestled in a challah bun.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=sWWUYOIEaqrmxOe2hqpzfg#sWWUYOIEaqrmxOe2hqpzfg  I had to opt out of the guacamole, but I didn't think it suffered from its absence.  As for the parmesan fries that came with the second burger, I didn't care much for them, because one, they weren't very flavorful, despite the addition of the parmesan, and two, the presentation wasn't as nice as it could've been, and had they tasted great, the presentation would not have mattered.  Next time, I'm going with lots and lots of sweet potato tots!

UPDATE: I downgraded from 5 stars to 4 when I recalled that I do NOT like their calamari.  Mom and I are great fans of calamari and always seek it in menus wherever we go.  We love fresh calamari that have light and cruncy batter, whether it be panko, flour, or regular breadcrumbs.  Most of the time, I eat them with just a sprinkling of lemon juice.  We've given Rigatony's calamari two chances (we forgot that we had already tried it once)- the platter is heavy on the batter; very bready/doughy.   --- Great local Italian eatery with two locations (Mesa and Chandler).  Mondays thru Fridays, Rigatony's offers $6.95 express lunch specials that differ daily (I LOVE their baked stuffed shells and their chicken cutlet piccata!), as well as the early bird special (which is also offered during lunch under "Pasta-bilities"), between 4p-5p where you get your choice of pasta, sauce, and toppings (vegetarian options abound), plus AWESOME antipasto salad (rivals that of Olive Garden's) and ciabatta bread !  I love that whole wheat spaghetti is available here.  My favorites are the cannelloni, the jumbo stuffed shells, the chicken piccata, and the alfredo and marinara sauces.  Check out the apple bread pudding with its awesome Frangelico caramel sauce!!

The Bavarian cream was mind-blowing!  Sexy and silky as sin, it was the best version of this donut variety I've tried thus far.  Embrace it and you won't (literally) be able to show your face in the morning.  Approach w/ caution!

Mom and I decided to check this place out when a cousin and her soon-to-be 18-year-old daughter visiting from NJ went to check out Forever 21 (a store I've never found anything I wanted to purchase from).  Love Culture has some very cute clothing!  Inexpensive, too-  I was able to find four fun spring-summery tops (between $13-$22) I could actually wear under a suit for work.    Brightly-lit, colorful, and nicely-spaced aisles.  Staff seemed friendly enough.  Am not a fan of their return policy, though.  I was only told about the 22-day policy at checkout, and nothing about how sale items, shoes, and accessories were final sale.  Only found out about the latter when I wanted to return a purse the next day, only to be told that it could not be returned per policy which was printed on the back of the receipt.  I went around the area where the purses and shoes were, and NOWHERE, not even at the check-out counter, were there any signs that mentioned final sale.  I'd still visit to see what pretty clothing I may find, but I'd definitely think thrice about purchasing from their shoes, accessories, and sale items.

3/19/11  Had to wait about 30 minutes as it was first come, first served.  Had expected to sit at the counter since there were just the two of us, but our server Jaime actually asked us if we'd prefer sitting at the next available table, which was a four-top, when there was space at the counter to seat two!  Why, of course!  And I thought since we were taking up more space than we needed, I invited a guest we'd been chatting w/ at the line to come join us!  The more, the merrier, right?    We had a great time conversing w/ our new friend (I actually was already acquainted w/ the guest, but  she made for a fun new dinner companion for my friend, too), as she had the 5-shrimp cocktail ($13.95, and the shrimp were almost the size of prawns!) and wine, while the two of us had small bowls of NE clam chowder ($5 each) and bread w/ glasses of wine.  (Pinot grigio and cab for $5.50 each?  Oh yeah!)  Next time, I'm getting a large bowl ($8) of that chowder... so tasty!  Great tip:  You can order your drinks here and take them up to Degree 270 (or anywhere, except out of the casino, for that matter!  Hmm... I wonder if you can take them up to your room??) and chill out up there!

4/6/12  My first visit, and it's been a long time coming!  According to my bookmarks page, I've wanted to try Chez Vous since 4/25/2011!  Funny that it took almost a year to do make it over here...  Liked the interior, which is a mish-mash of dark brown leather seats and tables near a playable piano (I know, bec. I played "Long Long Ago" on it!) and regular wooden chairs and tables across the display cases.  It is intimate and very cozy, yet not too claustrophobic.  I met Romain, the affable young son of the owners of CV, who informed me that he'd just arrived from France less than two months ago.  I also enjoyed the music selections playing that morning and mentioned this to Romain, who replied that the music was from his iPod.  It was easy to like Romain, whose enthusiasm for music was clearly evident when he'd sing along as he did his tasks.  Ah, how do I love the French accent... too bad Romain's a bit too young for me-- perhaps he has an older brother?  ;)    For my fist visit, I ordered a cappuccino and a chocolate croissant to start http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=88YpFgOk2FrK_JuIWXFFZQ#88YpFgOk2FrK_JuIWXFFZQ, and a Chef's Choice savory crepe for my main http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=y_ZuHT95MAlE5JD9eFhGxQ#y_ZuHT95MAlE5JD9eFhGxQ.  The cappuccino was beautiful to look at, and delicious to taste- the foam in it was perfect!  The chocolate croissant, I was told, was fresh from the oven, although mine wasn't warm to the touch.  However, it tasted marvelous, and the crisp layers of the croissant revealed the freshness of the pastry.  (I did order another croissant to go, which had just come out of the oven.)  It was all I could do to eat only half of the pastry, since I still had the savory crepe to look forward to.    The buckwheat crepe was filled with warmed cubes of green apple and chevre, and drizzled with honey and chives, and it came with a side salad (it automatically came with a brown sugar mustard dressing, something I cannot have, and which Romain replaced with fresh salad and Caesar dressing for me).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=5b0khkj_s6Rit_1HruvVLw#5b0khkj_s6Rit_1HruvVLw  It was dee-lish!  Sweet enough to satisfy my sweet breakfast cravings, yet not too sweet that the back of my lower jaw, where it meets my ears, hurts.  It felt a bit weird to have salad that early in the day, but I tried it anyway, in case it wilted before I had a chance to try it for lunch.  The dressing tasted very fresh, and I asked if it had eggs in it, to which Romain replied that it didn't, but didn't it taste like it did?  "Yes, it does."    I truly enjoyed breakfast here, and, as you can see, it wouldn't be too long until my next visit...

4/10/12  Cappuccino, chocolate croissant, Exotic (sweet) crepe, and Lorraine omelet.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=iE435_CgMXYBQw7nBbWs0A#iE435_CgMXYBQw7nBbWs0A http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=890pNO1bDcVqqnrx8Au3kA#890pNO1bDcVqqnrx8Au3kAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=tLYEev04PyiP4F8tRMrAyw#tLYEev04PyiP4F8tRMrAyw    The croissant was once again very good, but the cappuccino wasn't as pretty to look at as the first... I now wonder if I may have ordered the latte the first time around?  No matter- the coffee still delivered.  The Exotic, a white-floured crepe filled with dark chocolate ganache, bananas, and toasted coconut, was very nice... A little bit too sweet, but not so much that I couldn't finish the whole thing!  I made a note to perhaps wait till I have someone else to share this with the next time I order it, as it is so smooth...  One second it was in front of me, and the next, it was gone!  :(  So, I had to order something else to keep me company-- the Lorraine omelet.  Oh, my goodness, what a disaster!  It is my preference that my eggs be soft and tender, and the yellow more on the darker side; in other words, not overcooked.   This omelet arrived very light-yellow and looked hard.  A quick touch confirmed my suspicion.  Didn't like the cheese nor the bacon that the egg enveloped, either- the bacon had a gamey scent and flavor, and the cheese... Eh, I'd rather not wax on about this dish.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=wDf-EwLzSReVFg1iWRlutw#wDf-EwLzSReVFg1iWRlutw  Still loved the coffee, croissant, and sweet crepe, so still going to give four stars!  4/13/12  Cousin-in-tow, I ordered the Moka (with double shots of espresso), chocolate croissants, and the Brittany for us to share.  Cousin asked for the roasted tomato to be omitted, and chives substituted instead.  The Moka is fantastic!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=kWn44uYUnIcIKhXAw02f-Q#kWn44uYUnIcIKhXAw02f-Q  Our order was accompanied by a mini-carafe of more hot chocolate, and we finished it!  OK, so cousin had another cup, and I had a total of three during our breakfast course.  :P  I initially ordered one croissant, since cousin didn't want any, but I offered her a taste, and it didn't take long for me to see we'd need another one STAT.  The Brittany, a savory buckwheat crepe filled with roasted chicken, caramelized onions, creme fraiche, and the substituted chives, was d'lish! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m9aFZk1f8tSv248YErbpQA?select=09RhdGAd99fO13B3N7l_eA#09RhdGAd99fO13B3N7l_eA  Definitely something to order again.  :)

8/11/12  Wanted to get a much-needed mani/pedi before my sister and my dinner with a friend Saturday night, so I brought baby sis, my niece, and me to Scottsdale Nails II, but we were told the staff was fully booked until later on that afternoon, around 430p (it was around 1030a).  I told the man at the desk that we had other plans for the day and needed two mani/pedis right away before lunch, so he suggested we try out McDowell Mountain Nails on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd.  I've never been, but I knew the location, so I told my sister "why don't we try it?"  Situated at the Target plaza, between a Jamba Juice and a Ross on FLW east of the 101, MMN was easy to find.  It looked very unassuming from the outside, certainly much smaller than Scottsdale Nails II and my ex-favorite Shea Nails on 92nd St. (please read my reviews).  It was small indoors, but clean, and most importantly, lacked the horribly strong stench of chemicals that greeted us at Scottsdale Nails a few minutes before.  We were greeted by a young Caucasian male who was standing next to a female Asian, who was speaking on the phone.  A little different, since we're used to frequenting salons entirely staffed by Asians...  I asked if the two of us would be able to have our mani/pedis worked on right away, as well as my niece and her manicure, and he assured us most definitely.  The woman had by then gotten off the phone (thank goodness, as she was speaking directly to our faces while on the phone, instead of moving off to the side to give herself and us more privacy).  He told her what we were looking for, and she proceeded to tell him who to pair us up with.  I heard that I was going to get "the new girl," which then made me think, "why me?"  "Why do I get to try the new girl?"  I wasn't worried, however, as I had a feeling everything would work out fine.  After choosing our polish materials, we all went our separate ways.  The "new girl" Ann, was a joy to be with!  While she is new to this company, she told me she's been a nail tech for many years.  She had just finished a couple hours of orientation (she learned what the packages/treatments were called, and what steps she had to fulfill, etc.) that morning, and I was her first customer!  She worked gently, and listened to me tell her how we came to try out this salon, and would ask a couple of times if she was causing any discomfort.  Very easy to converse with- in case some of you are not able to understand staff with heavy accents, Ann speaks fluent English (and is studying Biochemistry... we're common souls!), so if this is important to you, ask for Ann.  :)  We finished slightly after my sister and her daughter.  My sister was seated for her spa pedicure before her manicure, while Ann started on my manicure first.  My niece was originally going to get just a manicure, but when I saw the embellishments that Linda had added to the nails, I asked how much it would be for a pedicure polish.  I was told $5 for just color, and $10 for the matching white polka dots and silver points.  I said let's get it done!  $55 for my gel manicure and spa pedicure, $25 for my niece's manicure (cleaning and polish) and pedicure (polish only), plus slightly over 20% tip*.  My sister got acrylic nails on her hands and a spa pedicure, as well.  We all left very happy and very satisfied with our new looks!  (Niece absolutely ENJOYED her first visit to the nail salon and cannot wait till their return here next year for another one!)  Thank you, McDowell Mountain Nails... I'll be a returning customer!  *MMN accepts credit cards for services rendered only, so bring cash for tipping!

9/26/10  I am overjoyed w/ my decision to have dinner here on the last night of Restaurant Week despite three days' of failed attempts to get out of work early enough to enjoy the sunset views!  The terrific value on such a delicious meal coupled w/ a great perlustration of the eternity pool/fountain in the patio deck made up for the missed survey of the desert mountain landscape (don't forget the beautiful Talking Stick golf course, resort pools, and water fixtures!).  Besides the two restaurant lounge areas, private dining booths, two Chef's tables ($2000 minimum ticket), and a large, yet intimate, main dining area, there are many "pockets" brimming w/ positive energy in the patio where one can enjoy a cocktail (or not!), catch up w/ friends, or just linger and take in the beauty of the space.  Before or after dinner, you can also enjoy a bit of live music (tonight featured a pianist)-- loved the aeronautic-themed chairs!    Enough on the atmosphere, let's get onto the food!  For Restaurant Week, Orange Sky's $39 menu featured:  APPETIZER: Lobster bisque; Half-dozen of iced oysters; OS dinner salad. MAIN COURSE: Filet of beef; Grilled half-chicken; Herb-crusted Pacific yellowtail tuna. DESSERT: Chocolate dome; Lemon semolina cake; Choice of gelato or  sorbet.  If I didn't have food allergies to worry about, I would've chosen the oysters to start; the tuna for the main, and the lemon cake to finish.  Instead, I ordered the salad, the filet, and the crowd-pleaser chocolate dome, and what a wonderful meal they made!!  The salad was comprised of greens and spicy candied walnuts dressed in a roquefort-sherry vinaigrette, and sprinkled w/ a few dashes of toasted shallot ribbons.  The sherry vinaigrette gave the salad a lovely, smooth, and mild flavor.  That is, until I'd bite into a roquefort crumble, which lent a welcomed burst of tang and pungency!  The combination of candied walnuts, roquefort, sherry, and shallots might not be for everybody, but I loved it- a great way to stir up my appetite!  The twin tournedos of beef filet were truly remarkable!  Cooked to medium, the filet was lovely to behold, and even more delightful to eat- the sauce choron, a bearnaise variation, that supplemented the dish made for a perfect pairing!  The steaks also came w/ two roasted sweet peppers, a few asparagus spears (a few I found were slightly overdone, but still very good), and silky mashed potatoes.  (I personally like a bit of texture in mashed potatoes, so I was very happy to find that this specimen wasn't TOO silky.  Alone, it was a tasty side, but after tasting the meat, the potatoes could've used a bit more seasoning.  However, I feel it's better to have to add more seasoning after than to have too much and not be able to enjoy a dish at all!)  I really appreciated that the steaks were presented twin-style instead of one whole-- I was able to enjoy a small serving and still have some room for dessert!  And oh, what a great dessert I had!  Drum roll please... The chocolate dome, made in-house, presented w/ two blackberries and a glaze of white chocolate and bitter orange.  The dome itself was a "hard shell"  of chocolate ganache (it really wasn't hard at all, and I personally would've appreciated the "break" of a chocolate bar here), sprinkled w/ almond brittle, and inside lay exquisite mantles of chocolate mousse and chocolate cake, which sat on top of a chocolate cookie!  While the dessert looked very rich and decadent, it was surprisingly light (I had three glorious bites before putting it aside to move onto the gelato).  I definitely wanted to take some of this cake to enjoy later at home ;)  The gelato, while not made in-house (or so the server believed), was equally satisfying- the coffee flavor was quite delicate-- this was a scoop to be savored ever-so-slowly, like a favorite spirit to be sipped over time, and not chased down.  I also had a cup of Peet's coffee to go along w/ dessert.  I waited a very long time to experience Orange Sky, and what a remarkable evening I had!  I will be back very, very soon!  p.s.  Small details, such as pretty dinnerware and embedded crystals in silverware (although I noted fingerprint smudges all over- tsk, tsk!), friendly and courteous service, and the lovely upgrades to the fixtures and decor really added to my overall satisfaction w/ my OS experience.  I would suggest everyone try Orange Sky at least once, but make sure you arrange yours w/ a sunset reservation!  (Unless, of course, you quite enjoy looking at the tops of brightly lit parking lots!)  p.p.s  Recall those private dining booths I mentioned?  They're certainly worth checking out if you value some privacy-- the tables all face panoramic views and certainly keep prying eyes from seeing who are seated.  [The only giveaway to the tables' occupancy was the pockets of barely discernible conversation my ears picked up as I walked by.  Visual inspection of the tables would have you believe that the booths were empty.

Yelp Eats Week 2011 (50% off!), Take 3:  07/14/11  My first visit and I already love this place!  It's got everything:  great location in Heritage Square; easy access to nearby parking (w/ validation- sweet!); classy, understated elegance; amiable and demure staff; and the gorgeous and terrific food!  What makes Nobuo stand out from all the downtown eats I've had the pleasure to try, though, is the low-noise level-- one would think that in such a historic building such as this, with wooden floors, wooden furnishings, and many small rooms that can easily fill up fast w/ lively diners, that it could get very noisy indoors, but in the two hours our group spent there, not once did I find it too noisy.    On to the food!  Still satiated from my late lunch, I decided to skip the apps and ordered the soft-shell crab sandwich, since I also wanted to have the Dark chocolate tofu mousse for dessert later.  From the adorable beverage booklet, the iced teas begged to be tried, so I ordered a Lychee red iced tea, which came unsweetened.  [Other selections were Hibiscus oolong iced tea, several varieties of green tea, Ramunes (Japanese flavored sodas, three varieties), sakes, red and white wines, beers, and $11 cocktails.]  Several others had ordered apps and were gracious enough to share-- the Teeter Tots app was a HUGE hit!  So much so, that two Yelpers ordered two servings, and another had three or more!  (The third one was dessert, someone remarked.  LOL)  These fried tofu cubes w/ miso sauce surprised me w/ their delicate crunchy exteriors that then revealed juicy tofu inside, and the spicy miso sauce that they were tossed in was impeccable!  I'm not sure if the twelve Yellow-tail sashimi spoons were house freebies, or if three Yelpers ordered them (four spoons per order), but I really enjoyed the two I had tried.  (I'd initially turned down invitations to try them since they contained avocado, which I love, but the fruit unfortunately does not love me; However, they looked so beautiful and so enticing that I eventually broke down and tried one, minus the avocado.  The first spoonful was exquisite- tangy, garlicky, and clean-tasting, and I had to have another!)  My sandwich was, just as Lindsey wrote, perfectly crafted-- two magnificently-toasted focaccia "buns" housing golden-brown battered small soft-shell crabs, with greens, red onions, and a pepper aioli (I asked that the cucumber be omitted).  I'd definitely order this entree again! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=gDhcFCQxrpOy47odikW29w#gDhcFCQxrpOy47odikW29w  Last, but certainly not least, the deep, silky Dark chocolate tofu mousse, w/ green tea ice cream and candied orange peel was divine! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ  (Notice a pattern here?)  The Orange-almond fritters were fantastic, too, but you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you don't try the mousse!    I'll be back very soon, Nobuo!

Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event, and I'd wanted to share my love of Nobuo's Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin, who has never been here before, so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldn't open till 5:30p, so we waited outside in the comfortable patio.  After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the "OPEN" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didn't like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldn't be taking up space for very long, anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected "Butai").  When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said "We don't have dessert menus, as we only have two..." and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our server's very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all, I'd already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin's phone needed recharging...    When Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table, I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I don't know about you, but the only times I've seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn't seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.    I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didn't want to give you anything, and you certainly didn't deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didn't enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didn't deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) I'd treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess I'll have to find another place to take her...  I don't want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.    Sorry, Nobuo, but I won't be returning.

03/28/12  Finally visited Lee's!  I think the first time I tried Lee's Cream Liqueur was the March OYE at Arizona Science Center a year ago, and then again at the Yelp Helps of December.  I'm so glad I had the time to finally check out the store on Stetson Dr.  Cute little place.  Loved the white filigree patio furniture, as well as the dark wood furniture indoors.  I really appreciated how there was only the one refrigerated section in the room, with "only" fourteen flavors containing alcohol, and six non-alcoholic flavors for the kiddies and those who may not want to booze it up.  (Sometimes "less is more.")  Sondra (sp?) was upbeat, friendly, and generous with the samples.  I was able to try about four flavors before settling on Sweet Nothings (chocolate ice cream, brownie chunks, toasted coconut, walnuts, and cognac) and really wasn't so sweet, and, my fave, Black Russian Kahlua (chocolate ice cream, chocolate creme liqueur, and Kahlua, I think).  Oh, how I dream about the BRK... Ooh, and the bit of waffle cone on top is a nice touch!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4QXz7NU6Knxa3pNOQd7_dg?select=ZiHuzw9Ladqg_p8ZB2Gt_g  A quick tip: Mention Yelp and you'll get a 15% discount!  I told Sondra how this was my first visit, but definitely not my first taste of Lee's Cream Liqueurs- that I tried it at a couple of Yelp events, and just like that, I saved 15%-- sweet!  (Pun intended.)    Another tip I just read on their FB page:  Mention you're a fan of their page and you will get 25% off your purchase!  (Comment was dated Sep. 2, 2011.)  Fantastic ice cream weather we're having, don't ya think?  :)

It was only two or three weeks ago that Lee told me she was working on licensing to expand, so it came as a sad surprise to read on FB today that she decided to sell the business AND close shop.  The status update mentioned that the flavors will soon make their way to grocery freezers, but not even the pretty and kind Gina knew about this when I stopped by at the shop this afternoon*.  [I had plans to go from massage to happy hour at a new place (to me!) when I decided I'd stop by and speak to someone at the shop itself about the sad news...]  Doors close tomorrow evening at 7 pm, so hurry and stock up on your favorite flavors!  Psst!  The Red Velvet Scotch was tasty!  (The cake's recipe is one of Paula Deen's.)  The flavor was a tad sweet, perhaps, but I definitely could discern the scotch and red velvety treasure there.  Plus, it's so pretty!!  :)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lees-cream-liqueur-scottsdale?select=I5PSw4fpFZdIWCG_3wkbng#I5PSw4fpFZdIWCG_3wkbng  For those who have unused gift cards and would like to get a refund, please visit Lee's Cream Liqueur's FB site to get more info.

Pls forgive short-hand use; Review would be too long, otherwise.  SERVICE: Reserved through OpenTable wks ago.  Checked in w/ host & she told me about a great spot for us where friend & I could hear each other talk & where one of us would have a view of the stage, & told her I appreciated the gesture, but could we both see the show?  She sat me @ a table across the stage & two-steps from the bar.  A great spot, 'til I noticed servers & busboys entering & exiting behind me (front patio dining area).  Soon got used to the clatter, but what eventually annoyed us was that people would block the stage view on their way & back from the kitchen!  (Restrooms were next to kitchen, too.)  It would behoove managers/owners to move the stage to somewhere with less foot traffic.  Was here months ago w/ a group (Irene V. incl.) so knew service could be rude.  Hoped tonight would be better.  Denzel came to greet me & asked if I was going to wait for my friend, or would I like to order anything to drink?  Told him I was going to do the Restaurant Week menu ($44 pp excluding tax & gratuity) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tapas-papa-frita-scottsdale#SPCe2DEC5YvywwjqA1h1jQ & asked to confirm that it came w/ a beverage (glass of Spanish Moscatel), & he immediately became excitable, w/ hand gestures, leaned in & said that it was an after-dinner drink that would arrive w/ dessert.  This was when I noticed he had bad breath.  (If you're in an industry where you have to interact w/ guests in person, you better have ways to keep your breath fresh, yes?)    Friend arrived & soon after, Denzel appeared again.  Already had an idea what to order, but she didn't, so we asked if he could come back in a few.  He came back after 15 minutes & friend proceeded to choose an app & a dessert to be brought together & was looking for one more item she'd spotted online, & while she was searching, he seemed like he was getting impatient, so I said "How about I place my order while she looks?" ("Good idea" said friend), & Denzel didn't seem to like this for he made a "whatever" gesture w/ his hands.  Had previously confirmed w/ him that I could sub out allergenic appetizers (1st course came w/ five items- shrimp, mushroom, beef tenderloin, rosemary goat cheese-stuffed date wrapped in bacon, & crab-stuffed piquillo pepper) for something else, so I told him I'd go for a 2nd stuffed date & the potato wedges he suggested.  I then asked for the pork tenderloin entree & chocolate churros for dessert.  My friend couldn't find what she wanted, so ordered a second dessert- banana-apple bread pudding.  LIVE ENTERTAINMENT: Classical Spanish guitarist already playing onstage @ 6:50p.  Very petite female dancer was a joy to watch (dramatic arm posturings, spins, tap-dancing & rhythmic stomping), but when it came to her partner's time to dance, while entertaining & footwork impressive, he was @ least two & a half times heavier than her, which meant his footwork taps & stomps were many times louder than hers.  My ears hurt every time he did his solos.  Take note & bring your earplugs if you want to keep your hearing intact!  FOOD: Didn't think I ate well for $44 plus tax.  Initially was going to order coffee w/ dessert after persuading Denzel to serve the Moscatel first & coffee w/ dessert, but he didn't come back to take my coffee order ($4-$9) & indeed forgot to place my churros order.  Friend's bread pudding arrived long before my dessert did, & my dessert was given to me by head chef who said that w/ the advent of the dropped plates of food in front of our table, our server didn't know I wanted churros (??).  Of all the 4 different apps, I liked the stuffed pepper & dates best.  The spicy potato wedges were good & the beef skewer was the worst- bland and unappetizing texture.  Puff pastry-wrapped pork entree was delicious, the meat tender, & the rice so fluffy & soft- almost like risotto w/ the saffron & cuttlefish sauces.  Churros weren't good.  Bit dry, heavy w/ sugar, came w/ a caramel filling, & minimal chocolate.  SERVICE WAS AWFUL, so even good food can't make things right for me.  My friend enjoyed her 2 stuffed piquillos & Catalan creme brûlée.  Tasty bread pudding arrived cold, w/ ice cream, so that was a disappointment, since we expected hot pudding.  We asked for boxes to take our desserts home, & Denzel arrived w/ what appeared to be a bowl & a lid & placed them in front of her.  When I tried to stop him from leaving so as to avoid  flagging him over for another bowl & lid, he made exaggerated motions of separating the bowls & lids & placing them in front of friend & me.  Friend had to cover her mouth to keep from laughing!  Why didn't he do this in the first place?  Ugh.  Stay away from here if you value service!

11/19/15  Had a Groupon that was to expire last night, so took Mom for dinner.  I've been enticing her to go since buying the coupon in July, but she could not remember ever dining here, so she kept saying no.  She certainly remembered after taking one bite of her lamb entree!  All she kept saying was "Oh, wow" and "So good!," over and over, and soon I began to chime in canon.  But I am getting ahead of my updated review...  When we entered the restaurant, I almost did not recognize the place, since the atmosphere has certainly changed.  The kitchen window is still there, but it's now fronted by two tables, in the shape of an L, upon which the register is on one end, and styrofoam food containers and baklava and other pastries in to-go containers are on the other end.  Three walls have pretty mural photo wallpapers of lush green scenery and ruins on them, and there are lovely new plum/burgundy cushioned booths installed.  Perhaps the owners will open up the kitchen a bit more, to let us see more of the kitchen action.  Being able to only see the kitchen staff's faces gives me the willies, for some reason... Hehe!  :)  After Mom had a few bites of her lamb entree, with half-saffron rice and half-salad, she asked me to find more ZK Grill Groupons to use in the future. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zk-grill-phoenix-2?select=OKlzf5ZnGDgzy53noOlAzQ  I already knew that she loved the food here (so did I), so I am always looking out for ZK Grill deals.  Have I told you yet about the Chicken and Filet entree I ordered? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zk-grill-phoenix-2?select=XTjf8HfYHfWdU0OYLWBWhw  I also went with half-saffron rice (yes, I still am allergic to rice, but I can't say no to saffron rice, especially buttered saffron rice!) and half-salad-- you MUST try the champagne vinaigrette here, oh my goodness!  Great portions, and even better still, great flavors and textures (meat, salad, and rice).  I'll forgo the chicken next time (nice color and slight grill flavor, but the texture was ALMOST on the tad-dry side) and just go full-on filet, but now that I think about it, I don't think that's even an option here (??).  There's lamb, lamb with ground beef (a la koubideh style), chicken shawarma, chicken and filet, but I don't think there's lamb and filet nor just filet.  Hmm...  We ended our meal with Saffron ice cream, but instead of a scoop of ice cream and a cookie wafer placed on top, it's now made into an ice cream sandwich between two wafers and pre-packaged. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zk-grill-phoenix-2?select=849LmOk-UwUvmTvx3is6jg  Same great ice cream flavors (rosewater, saffron, and pistachio) and little bits of pistachio bits for texture, but the wafers aren't crispy anymore-- the refrigeration has caused them to lose their crispiness.  I hope the owners/staff revert back to serving this dessert item like they used to, a scoop of ice cream with one wafer on top, and perhaps a second one upon request!

01/20/11  It doesn't take much to talk me into trying a new breakfast joint... I've a list of restaurants that were bookmarked YEARS ago, and I've yet to step into those places to order my first meals there, and yet, I read a couple of enthusiastic yelp reviews about Joe's Diner, and I'm there w/in a week or less, savoring for myself forkfuls of those delicious pancakes I read about, but there I go, getting ahead of myself...  Delighted in finding ample parking (I think I arrived around 1030a or so), I walked into Joe's Diner pleasantly surprised to find a cozy 50s-, 60s-style diner.  Yes, yes, I read all about the atmosphere here, and I was still a little disconcerted, coming in from the open-air parking lot, but pleasantly so.  I liked some of the memorabilia, but I don't know what to make of the outdoor decor-- roofed and cemented empty garage w/ the parked truck?  Seems like wasted space to me- perhaps this is where the weekend overflow goes...  I initially was directed to the more-crowded room at the back of the diner, but it was much darker in there, and I wanted light (!), so I asked if I could have a booth in the more-spacious front.  "Sure," the hostess said, w/out blinking an eye, and I was already off to a great start.  Couldn't decide what to have, so I decided to order the items that appealed most-- biscuits and gravy, pancakes w/ a side of fresh strawberry compote, and Thursday's lunch special of lasagna.  Ordered a cup of deliciously strong Arbuckles coffee, too.  The sausage and biscuits came out relatively fast-- good to note if you're really hungry and you want something quick! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/53jjJCXpXSRaHfu_ZJePRA?select=LkEf3z8DxtMVZbRY-2E9tA#LkEf3z8DxtMVZbRY-2E9tA  I didn't care much for the biscuits, though.  Found them to be too tender.  (I like my biscuits to buckle, not crumble, a bit when I dig in w/ my fork.)  I'd requested the regular sausage to be substituted w/ chorizo, and the gravy was nicely done.  Too bad about the biscuits...  I next tried the lasagna... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/53jjJCXpXSRaHfu_ZJePRA?select=CB1MtmdiQS9wvpePLAUcBw#CB1MtmdiQS9wvpePLAUcBw  Wow!  I really enjoyed the bites I had sampled.  The pasta was al dente- tender, yet had a nice bite to it; the filling was well-seasoned, yet not too salty-- meat was chunky, and the ricotta portion was generous; and the garlic bread that accompanied the entree was warm, perfectly crusty, and deliciously buttered.  I wouldn't mind returning back on a Thursday to have this dish again.  Last, but certainly not least, the pancakes!!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/53jjJCXpXSRaHfu_ZJePRA?select=cD_SaPRv1RkiWivD6qBQBw#cD_SaPRv1RkiWivD6qBQBw  Portion seemed small- there wasn't much of a rise, so I mistakenly thought the platter was of a short stack, but the server asked me to lift all cakes to see for myself.  Yep!  I counted three.  These cakes tasted amazing, and all they needed were a tiny bit of butter and simple toppings of macerated strawberries (I had to ask for a second serving of fruit).  Now, I wouldn't mind returning any day of the week to have a stack of these carb-delights!  Cool retro decor; warm and friendly service, a bit relaxed in pace; and two out of three knock-out entrees on the first try put Joe's Diner on my list to visit again soon!  I'd take out-of-town guests here in a heartbeat!

Arrived back from a terrific meal at Beckett's Table!  Before I wax on, I would like to say kudos to the Becketts and Stephens' on their 2nd opening night!  FOH was in fine form (from the immediate greeting at the hosts' stand; to server Cort's affable personality & eagerness to please, as well as server Travis' assistance throughout the evening; and yet another server's readiness to show me to the restroom, instead of pointing the way.  (An example of four-diamond service, and I should know, since we're given the four-diamond spiel daily where I work!)  When I inquired deeper into the Legend City cocktail's ingredients, Cort offered to have Scott Stephens, the drink's inventor and BT's co-owner, come out to greet and tell me about it himself!    As soon as I crossed the wide-open sliding-door glass panels and into the restaurant, I was in-love w/ the ambience!  It's rustic St. Francis (and a little bit of The Parlor) meets laid-back, yet mysteriously sexy Olive & Ivy.  (Think what you will about these venues' food and ambience, but I happen to love the spaces of all three!)  Really liked how I could watch what was going on in the kitchen, bar, community tables, and the main dining room w/out being subjected to too much noise.  Even the restroom door had a bit of novelty to it- go check it out and see what I mean.  Alright, so what about the food??  Where shall I start?? Let me preface by saying that I already knew what I wanted, having checked out the menu online after reading about Opening Night at BT (but I'd already eaten, darn it!), but I played along and had a look at the lovely watermarked printed menu Cort gave me.  Didn't know if I felt like  having cockails or wine yet, so I asked for the Bacon cheddar biscuits and the Mac 'n Cheese w/ pancetta, please.  Wanted to try the Legend City cocktail, but wasn't sure what "ricard" was (and now know, thanks to Scott!).  When Cort came back for my drink order, I asked "the short ribs (a fave of one of the hosts'), or the osso bucco?"  W/out batting an eyelash, Cort said "get the osso bucco; it's my favorite on the entire menu!"  Sold!  As I waited for my biscuits and macaroni dish, I spied next table's inhabitants (Hi Karen and Elsa!) breaking into their table bread, so I asked Cort if I could have some, too, please!  Looking all around me, at the hustle-bustle of the kitchen and everyone's smiling faces, I knew I was in for a treat!  The bacon cheddar biscuits were delightful!  Loved the crusty cheese topping, and I enjoyed feeling the weight of the biscuit in my hands as I tore off a piece to peer inside-- it was like I was on slow-mo' breaking bread!  (Cue in "Six Billion Dollar Man" bionic sound effect here.)  You must order this and smell the aroma!  It tasted heavenly, and while the apple-honey butter was tasty, its presence wasn't needed.  The complimentary bread rolls were also delicious!  Take away the biscuits and leave me the rolls, and I'd still be happy!  Don't forget to mention the mac 'n cheese!  They don't make the pastas in-house, but they are ordered in especially ("no ordinary pasta," said Cort).  The tasty cream sauce consisted of a blend of some of my favorite cheeses, which included asiago, fontina, manchego, and white cheddar.  Crispy pancetta on top sealed the deal.  I may just have to order this side dish every time I visit!  Next came the pork osso bucco confit.  I neglected to ask which local butcher shop the pork came from, so I can't say.  However, I will say that this dish, on the whole, was a beauty!  It came w/ butternut squash spaetzle (so pretty!) and crisp roasted veggies (golden beets, yellow squash, brussels sprouts, shallots, and perhaps leeks).  The pork confit sat atop a lovely and piquant black pepper reduction.  While I thought that the presentation could've been better (the pork itself didn't look quite finished, temp-wise, but I assure you it was!), the textures and flavor bouquets in this dish were very pleasing, indeed.  So what came next?  Could anything else impress me after all I've tried?  Ah, yes.  I ordered the Death By Chocolate, which was chocolate ganache on top of dense chocolate cake filled w/ chocolate buttercream, w/ a dusting of finely-grated chocolate on top.  Y'know, just for looks.  Jeez-louise!  Talk about killing me softly!  I've achieved transcendence.  For now.  I'll be back- thanks BT!

03/06/12  My first breakfast at Tryst, and I cannot wait to go back!  (Especially since Tryst offers organic and local produce-- just say no to GMOs!)  Arrived at 1pm and had only 45 minutes to spare-- good thing I already checked out the menu online and decided what I wanted to try: the Monte Cristo w/ a side of sweet potato tots, and a cup of organic coffee http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2DmTw0k3bcXuHdAyxO_bkw?select=tYVvx24tyHyryZWgtiTVOg.  Was seated in Joanna's section- friendly server!  The Monte Cristo- two slices of French toast with ham, melty gruyere cheese, and strawberry jam, sliced into two halves, arrived nine minutes after I ordered it-- fantastic!!  The dish looked beautiful, and the plate hadn't even touched my table for two seconds when I overheard Joanna describe to someone at another table what I had ordered.  It was that striking!  Looked so tantalizing, and I loved the sweet and salty combination.  I just wished it was heartier... I worked very hard to eat only one-half of the dish.  Same thing with the sweet potato tots (loved the crunch factor of these!)... It didn't take me long to work my way through half of the dish, and I still wanted more!  The Black and Tan organic coffee (black, no cream) was just OK.  I might try a cappucino next time, if only to check out the coffee art.  ;)  I think I'm going to check out the Pineapple upside-down pancakes tomorrow!  Note: Tryst offers "Tryst Around the World," and March is "Ireland" (I think last month was France).  Anyhoo, there's Potato leek soup (this sounds interesting!), and the salmon dish caught my eye. Tryst offers $10 off if you make a dinner reservation- something worth noting.

03/07/13  While I immediately signed up for the free loyalty account online in July 2010, this was my first time watching a movie here.  I could kick myself for waiting all this time to find out what all the fuss was about!  I entered the theater lobby through the Tanzy entrance, so I passed the concession stand to my right and the wrap-around couch with the wine kiosk to my left to get to the "box office" to redeem one of my  premium plus seating passes I received at the Yelp Elite event held at Tanzy back in December.  (Yes, they were inside those delightful gift bags that very fortunate Yelp Elite members get to take home after having such a wonderful time at these events!)  I was going for the 7p Thursday showing of "Jack, the Giant Slayer**," so besides the couple that arrived before me, and who were being taken care of by a clerk, I was the only one waiting in line, and I didn't have to wait very long.  While it was nice not to have to wait for more than a minute, or two, I can see how these lines could get very long and tiresome during peak times, so I suggest you book your tickets online, or via mobile-- not only to avoid waiting in long lines (since there's only room for two clerks to wait on people), but to make sure you can select the seats you want!  I've been to Ultra Star and Studio Movie Grill before, so I was familiar with the seat selection process, but if you've never been to either of these theaters, then visiting for the first time with only a few minutes to get through the ticketing process before the movie starts might make the whole experience a little stressful.  Be wise, and take some time now to check out www.ipic.com and familiarize yourself with the theater to maximize your theater enjoyment!  :)    After greeting me a warm welcome and asking me if I've ever been there before, I answered with a "no, she then asked me for my surname.  (Btw, everyone here is so friendly, before, during, and after the movie!)  After giving her my name, I was reminded that I did sign up for the loyalty program a few years ago, which then gave me a little jump seeing how long this theater has been open!  Soon after this process and with ticket in hand, I found my way to auditorium #3 and quickly located my luxury seat.  Oh, my goodness!  I knew already that this was quickly going to be one of my favorite theater venues, and after settling down onto my seat and handed my free popcorn and 3D glasses, and my request for a glass of water, I knew that I was in for a terrific treat!  And then, the 3D trailers started to play... OH, BOY!  :)  $17 for premium plus seating, with no price difference between regular and 3D films, is a gorgeous steal when you consider everything you're getting in return: free popcorn (for you popcorn lovers), a pillow, a lux blanket, AND a seat with a button that, upon depressing, raises your legs so that you're able to recline as if laying down in a first-class airplane cabin.  The 3D glasses I received provided me the BEST 3D movie experience outside of 3D IMAX ($18.75 for "Avatar" at Harkins Arizona Mills) and a 4D Immersion experience (an additional $5 for a 15-, or 20-minute film per person with an admission ticket to Baltimore's National Aquarium).  Most theaters charge at least $13 for a 3D experience that, at least for me, can be a hit-or-miss, and then, for those who absolutely need it at the movies, a small bag of popcorn, which can cost you at least $3 elsewhere, so add another $1, you get a personal bed, complete with a pillow and blanket, and the chance to enjoy a 3D film with what must be state-of-the-art 3D glasses!  (I so wished I saw "Life of Pi" 3D here...)  From the moment the trailers began, I had a feeling I found THE place I'm going to watch 3D "at the movies" from now on-- at iPic!  And after taking a quick look at the cocktails menu, I know what I'm going to try on my next visit, which I will dutifully post a photo of, and it will be very soon, so stay tuned!  :)  p.s.  Free valet with your paid, or gifted, premium plus ticket!    ** Great movie, considering everything you've read of the children's classic fable, and for all of the special effects, the only way to see them, at least for me, is multi-dimensional!  I'm looking forward to seeing more 3D films here.

Met a friend here yesterday before a movie.  I actually arrived first, around 5:50 pm, told the bartender I was waiting for a friend who was going to join me at a 6:15 pm movie and asked if I could order the Table-side Mozzarella For Two to take with us.  He said there wouldn't be enough time to order the app, but that we could order apps on the happy hour menu list and take those, so I chose the calamari and the meatballs, which were $8 each.  The calamari smelled fishy (not the sea-fresh scent) and had terrible texture, as if it was undercooked. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tanzy-scottsdale?start=100&select=Kdc4C3svJf6R7QmXrGo5ZQ#Kdc4C3svJf6R7QmXrGo5ZQ  The meatballs were good, albeit on the smallish side**, with a nice dollop of ricotta cheese, but the dish wasn't accompanied by any crostini, unlike my previous orders, which were admittedly a year, or more ago. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tanzy-scottsdale?start=100&select=nNFXqb2B8vN8envJcgRl7g#nNFXqb2B8vN8envJcgRl7gI  I asked for a little bread, but didn't have time to wait for it as we had to leave for the movie.    Don't know if I'd order the meatballs again, especially since the crostini were omitted, but my friend and I will be back to try the Mozzarella for two soon.  **This is what the meatball crostini app looked like in March 2013! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tanzy-scottsdale?select=9aiYhoNUaF_nJWOkYu-yjg#9aiYhoNUaF_nJWOkYu-yjg  #740

First of all, many thanks to the awesome Deb L. and her fun-loving hubby Michael, for hosting tonight's UYE at this elegant restaurant!  (It's definitely "date night" material-- and not only for romantic couples; I spotted a father and daughter, dressed to the nines, and they looked like they were having a great time!)  Nine of us were in attendance, and I'd say that the dinner was a huge success!  This was my first visit, and while I had to leave shortly after the food came out, I felt sad leaving this very lively group-- it was great to have caught up w/ Deb, Mike, and Heather C., and so nice to have made new acquaintances!  I hadn't even left the building yet, and I already knew I was coming back!  (Heather, we're definitely doing breakfast SOON!)  While waiting for other Yelpers to arrive, I'd inquired about whether HB only served wines, since that was the only drink menu that was presented to us, but no, our friendly and very helpful server Chelsea said that HB had a full bar, and that she would return to let us know what specialty cocktails they had to serve that evening.  Besides their house red sangria ($9?), HB was also offering a Blackberry mojito ($9) and a St. Germain elderflower margarita ($11).  While both sounded delicious, I decided to go w/ the mojito since I have a large bottle of the elderflower liquor ($32!) sitting in my fridge back home (I was inspired to buy after having some elderflower champagne flutes at Chandler's Cork!)  Oh. My. God!  If you like berries, you MUST try this mojito!  It was so full of muddled whole blackberries, you'd think it was puree, and it wasn't overly sweet-- I felt like I was having quite a nutritious beverage!  I hardly tasted the alcohol...  I very much wanted to order another one, but I knew I had to leave early.  I cannot wait to come back for happy hour!  :D  By the time everyone showed up and had a chance to make introductions and make really interesting chit-chat (again, Deb and Mike were great hosts!), we were ready to order and eat!  I kid you not, everyone's selections looked amazing!  I'm sure we'll be reading about their selections soon enough, so let me tell you about mine...  I was curious about the gouda mac 'n cheese from the very moment I read about it on Deb's prior review, so I knew to order these.  How fortunate to see that the Thai BBQ baby back ribs came w/ a side of it, as well as a green apple slaw.  I concede that the mac 'n cheese was good, but I think it would've been better w/ more cheese and slightly more crunchy breadcrumbs.  The sour apple slaw provided a nice crunch and just enough sweet-sour to counteract the spiciness of the baby back ribs.  Ohhh... those tender ribs!  The BBQ sauce was thick, sticky, sweet, yet had a great kick!  (I didn't find it too spicy, but others might... you've been warned!)  It was very fortunate for Mom that I had to leave the party so soon, or else she would not have had the chance to try the leftovers; there wouldn't have been any to take home!  (And yes, she's already eaten the rest of the meal!)  Afterwards, I stopped at the adjoining market to take home a slice of Chocolate-peanut butter banana bread cake ($5), a Strawberry-blackberry handpie ($5), and a goat cheese-chive potato cake ($3).  (So many of the others had a potato cake as a side to their entree, and I was so envious-- they looked great on the plates, and everyone said they were delicious, and I completely agree w/ them!)  Loved the potato cake's great textures- the caramelized outer crust had enough crunch, but quickly yielded to reveal the buttery potato delight, w/ goat cheese crumbles all-throughout inside-- not at all greasy, and I loved the rich and creamy consistency that the goat cheese gave to the potato cake!  I will have to buy some of these to take home on every visit from now on!  FYI, the desserts were perfect, as well!  The crust on the handpie tasted almost like shortbread, the sugared top of the crust was exquisitely crisped, and the fresh berry filling also incorporated a citrus-y element-- my guess is orange peel/bergarmot oil essence.  The banana bread cake was so moist, had beautiful texture (see pics),  not too sweet, and packed full of banana goodness... Loved the peanut butter layer under the chocolate ganache "icing" (no powdered sugar used in their icings here!).  The cake also had peanut butter drizzle all over the top.  It's a pretty cake, and I wouldn't hesitate to order a whole one to-go...    Hey, Heather-- you free this weekend??

july 8, 2012  For my birthday brunch, I ordered four menu items to share amongst everyone, which included the red velvet pancakes (but of course!), the Herb Tomato, goat cheese, and chive omelet, the Market BLT (I've tried it before, and it was fantastic!), and a new addition to the menu, one I'd wanted to try for two years now, but I keep missing the opportunity-- the Bourbon-ginger peach brioche French toast!  I also ordered two mango mimosas for my cousin and me (Mom and aunt did not want any)...  What more can I say about the red velvet pancakes that I haven't said before? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=25P_k0Ot6qR9aV5IYzGTVQ#25P_k0Ot6qR9aV5IYzGTVQ  Just order them when you go, and thank me later.  I skipped on the omelet this time http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=YO8Ft30ml8XwNW4K2Drq3Q#YO8Ft30ml8XwNW4K2Drq3Q, since I had only one thing on my mind, and it was the French toast... OMG! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=pC5n1Ejy5dpyvZQlY1uTBQ#pC5n1Ejy5dpyvZQlY1uTBQ  This is how French toast should be prepared-- crispy, yet not greasy, on the outside and tender, not fluffy, on the inside.  The ratio of custard batter to bread was spot-on.  Nothin'  soggy 'bout it.  Oh, and the bourbon-ginger peach compote that was the crux of the entree?  Superb!  Yeah, I had to ask for another pot of this.  Hey, I'll take a couple of jars home, if you got some to sell!  I seriously hope I never have to choose between the red velvet pancakes and the French toast, because I wouldn't, COULDN'T begin to contemplate.  The only disappointment during the whole meal was the Street Market BLT. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=L03fNbFT9uWaiI69ELoUFw#L03fNbFT9uWaiI69ELoUFw  While the ingredients- pancetta, wild arugula, tomato, ricotta, and a fried egg (mmm... there's something about arugula and fried egg together...) tasted fantastic, the bread was over-charred, and it just almost ruined the dish.  I just peeled the bread back and ate the goodness in between.  Hmm... yeah.  'Tis best not to go there.  Mango mimosas for $5 a pop?  I see many more Sundays off from work in my future!  p.s.  Thank you Shad, and THB, for my glorious red velvet birthday cupcake! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=dk-G0E6bgC4JoZOQBPaqfQ#dk-G0E6bgC4JoZOQBPaqfQ  Three of us kept going back to the plate for more, and there were still leftovers... You were so right-- the cream cheese frosting was spectacular!

02/15/16  Forgive me, oh Lord, for I have sinned... I don't know what I was thinking eating a sandwich, side salad, AND drinking an entire blackberry mojito (it was sooooo good!) at a nearby restaurant when I could have just had a couple of bites there and then gone for a second cocktail here...  Of course, instead of ordering a cocktail (the flaming cocktail expert Richie Moe wasn't in the house, yo!), I decided to go for an espresso and try that delicious-sounding black & tan pudding http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/d10IxZPirVJlOSpdRZJczA?select=eKxPXAmYF0fu0b38M4lpsA  our server said was his favorite dessert on the menu.  By the time the sweets arrived, I'd already inhaled the espresso, so I had to get a cup of drip coffee, black.  Oh lordy, lordy, lordy- what a beautiful combo the decadent chocolate pudding and luscious and oh-so-sinfully-creamy caramel (my fave of the two flavors), topped with fresh whipped cream and a peanut brittle crumble made w/ both coffees!  Yeah, me wanna love you long time!  A shout out to our super-fun server, Newman.  What a terrific guy!  ;)

A simple farm it is, but still made for a lovely outing this morning before breakfast elsewhere.  Truly enjoyed seeing the kids (baby goats) greet visitors at the front of the tiny, but quaint shop.  There were more goats frolicking outside behind gates, at the other end of the shop, and I heard a young woman say she was very excited to take home one of the goats (she mentioned a name, but I forgot), so I'm assuming one may adopt from here?  Don't quote me on this, though, because assuming may sometimes make an ass out of you and me... Those two small specimens out in the front seemed a delight to care for, but I know they're more than two handfuls!  I spotted beautiful vegetables for purchase, as well as homemade breads (some were gluten-free- the zucchini loaf looked tempting), snacks (trail mix, bags of granola, dried fruit, and raw seeds, etc.), goat milk ice creams and cheeses, and so much more.  Small batches of each, so come early!  Note that cash is the only payment accepted.  It's so awe-inspiring that the honor system is observed here.  I felt the love at this farm, indeed.  Hoping to visit again when my attention isn't diverted by hunger.  Will try to visit before the farm closes sometime in June due to the high heat of summer; I hear it will reopen sometime in October.  FYI, the goat milk caramels piqued my interest as I pored over the farm's website, but the ingredient info lists light corn syrup, so beware.  A bag of about ten candies costs $10.  I've tried local goat milk fudge at fairs in the past, as well as eaten Laloo goat milk ice creams (can be found at Whole Foods), and liked them, so I'm glad that these caramels contain corn syrup to keep me away!  Hehe.  Thanks for helping me save money and calories, TSF!  And again, CASH ONLY!

3.75 stars!    Just finished putting away leftovers from a take-out order I placed via phone six minutes before closing time.  Mom was hungry, so I asked, would you like some pizza or Chinese?  She said Chinese, and as I started to look for the Flo's menu I had in my purse, she mentioned the pamphlet we received in the mail from Asian Island.  While she pored over the menu, I checked for Yelp reviews and found only one of significance (by that, I mean those reviews written by elites-- real photos and names), that of Scott D.'s.  Mom gave up looking, disgusted at seeing the high prices.  "What do you mean the food's expensive?," I asked.  I looked at the menu, and I didn't see anything over-the-top ($9 chicken; $10 beef and pork; $11 shrimp), so I decided I'd go w/ Scott D.'s wife's selection of Shrimp Lo Mein for Mom, and the Twice-cooked Pork for me.  I'd requested that they omit carrots, celery, and, if any, corn and mushroom.  The woman on the phone repeated these veggies TWICE, so I gathered that she was taking careful notes...  The food was very tasty!  Mom said the shrimp dish was "good!"  I asked "Good-good or good-because-you're-hungry-good?"  She said "good-good, but not 'out-of-body experience' good."  (To quote Scott D.)  LOL  My twice-cooked pork (bbq pork sauteed w/ CARROTS, bell pepper, water chestnuts, spring onions, CELERY, and onions, among other things, was also very tasty!  Mom liked the dish, as well, but, when asked, preferred the shrimp.  I had also requested a side of egg noodles (loved the bean sprouts!), instead of rice, and I really appreciated that they obliged!  Other restaurants would've forced me to take rice, which I cannot have, and then make me pay for a side order of noodles.  This alone deserved a star!    Easily 4, 4.5 stars, which isn't bad for my first take-out meal from here, and I'd have given 5 stars if my request for certain veggies to be omitted was followed.  I will return to try other items, and, hopefully, they'll be more mindful about my food allergy concerns!  Lunch options look tantalizing, and sushi and Hawaiian dishes are also available!

A bunch of Yelpers and I were craving for something sweet after attending Irene's UYE at Cuttlefish yesterday.  Chez Vous, across the parking lot, was closed, so Linda and I thought La Petite France was another great option.  We initially thought there were five of us going, but one couple didn't appear...  Linda had mentioned last year that LPF had changed owners, so I was glad to see that Val (co-owner) was still there!  (I suppose Linda's last visit was before I had started going there.)  On to the food... I decided to go with a past breakfast choice of mine, the $8.95 Hot chocolate ("sugar, butter, chocolate, cinnamon"), which Yelp friend Judy F. had suggested in her review.  While last night's crepe was d'lish, it wasn't as good as I had remembered to be. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-petite-france-scottsdale?select=1CMIghOEB95KYwUxjrg8AA#1CMIghOEB95KYwUxjrg8AA  I think it was the addition of whip cream, which I normally would have requested to be left out.  (I forgot to ask if the crepe came with whip.)  Last night's dish also had more chocolate syrup on it.  Linda's choice, on the other had, was so delicious!  She had the $9.95 Suzette Flambee ("butter, sugar, honey and rum, vanilla ice cream, whipping cream"), which was set on fire, complete with the lights very briefly turned off.  The dish was still afire when the lights came back on, so it wasn't quite as romantic a notion as it could've been...  The rum-laced ice cream was the star of the show, I thought.  A must-order-again, for sure!  :)

I didn't know there was a Clarks store at Scottsdale Fashion Square-- now I know!  I've visited the AZ Mills location a few times, but I rarely buy anything from there.  Mostly because it is rare to find size 5 women's Clarks' brand dress shoes and boots anywhere, and those size 5 shoes I do find were so unattractive that the designers and shoe companies should be heavily fined for making a profit off of them!  (Oh, they were comfortable alright, but dress shoes and dress boots have to look sexy, as well.)  What an exciting prospect it was, then, that I found not one, but FOUR pairs of shoes online over the holidays that I could see myself wearing while at work and at play, so I happily paid just under $410 (including taxes; free shipping) for them.  They arrived fairly quickly, considering it was holiday shopping season.  Shipping and returns are always free, and I was glad to see that I could do returns at stores, and not just online.  I've lost a couple of pairs returning them via USPS once, and I was not a happy camper...  Back to the shoes- out of the four pairs (two black and two brown), I only found one of them to be comfortable enough to keep, so I returned the other three tonight without a hassle.  I love that!  I was able to get almost $300 credited back to my credit card, and I walked away with a black shoe polisher that costs slightly more than what it would have been if I went searching for it elsewhere- thank goodness I didn't have to!  Clarks' is currently having its semi-annual sale.  There were signs of 30%- and 40% off all over the store.  Shoe care is 3 for $18, and belts and other accessories are also on sale.  Might be worth it to visit again soon... Oh, no, I just remembered... This Clarks location doesn't have much size 5 in stock for me to try.  :(  Guess it's back to online shopping for me...

I've only recently gotten partial highlights (twice in my lifetime, and both from Mood Swings this summer), and I must say I enjoy coming here!  The first hairstylist has left, but the second, Stephanie, is equally good.  I still get compliments even though it's been two months since and the roots have definitely grown out.  The costs for hair appointments are very reasonable.   While I don't go for the costly massages at the salon below anymore, I do have to thank the massage therapist Alicia for the wonderful first massage (I've had two here) as it instilled in me a desire for regular massages elsewhere.  While most of the massage therapists I've found at SWIHA are great, I do miss the atmosphere here at Mood Swings spa.  At the end of the day, however, the quality of massages trump over atmosphere, at least it does in my book.  BTW, if you do decide to try massages here, be sure to watch the clock.  They tend to stroll in late and end the sessions early.  Prices for sessions are costly.

Placed an online request to see Abby for a cut and color for 11a Sunday 12/27 last week.  As soon as I clicked "submit," I received an email confirming the receipt of the request and that this receipt was not a confirmation of a booking (the confirmation will arrive via phone call).  That said phone call came two days later- the clerk left a message on my cell, w/c I unfortunately deleted soon after I heard it, that I had the appt. and for me to call should I need to change my plans.  I was satisfied w/ the arrangements, so I saw no need to call.  I drove over 23 miles yesterday (from Laveen to Tempe), arrived exactly at 11a, only to be told that I did not have an appt. w/ Abby.  No one knew what happened, and that I could not get another appt. as per the email and online request.    I will never use the onine booking request again; Next time (if there even is a next time) I will call it in and have it confirmed right then and there.  This was the second time I did an onine booking w/ Moodswings that ended with less than a satisfactory conclusion (the first instance was confirmed and then cancelled two days before the date).  The two times I've had a cut and color here, I gave 20% tip, so I don't know why I would be treated so unprofessionally.  (I should count myself lucky that they had the decency to let me know of the first cancellation, w/c saved me the drive to Tempe.)      I doubt I'll return for services here again.

Since late November, I've already attended seven one-hour sessions at Floo-id, and I absolutely love this place!  [I've just booked another session for tomorrow (TH) morning.]  I started w/ two Saturdays of Hot Yoga w/ owner Beth Beary, but I soon branched out and added a second weekly session of Hot Flow, which isn't as hot as Hot Yoga, but is more physically-challenging.  (Well, at least to me it is!)  I thought perhaps I could stretch out my Groupon deal by cutting out HY and just sticking to HF, but no...  After only one week of experimentation, my body is telling me that it NEEDS the two differing yoga sessions to feel at peace!  I'm hoping to get a chance to try other classes offered here as soon as my schedule allows.  The facility is clean and organized, and I've so far worked w/ four instructors, and they're all terrific w/ keeping me motivated and pushing the class to put in the extra effort, to ask more out of our bodies and minds.  In less than a month of attending yoga classes here, I found myself inspired again to go back to school!  (I hope to delve into microbiology and lab in a couple of weeks.)

I haven't been back in months.  The last time I went, the man next to me dripped so much sweat, the droplets invaded my space-- I couldn't do my own moves for fear of getting his perspiration on me.  Hey, if the guy was a hottie, I may have not minded half as much... ;)  The room stank like used gym socks and wet leather, and sour anti-perspirant, as well- ugh!   I asked Beth, the owner, if she would ask the male patrons to wear a shirt and not go topless.  She replied that she really couldn't tell people what to wear.  I said it's not telling people what kinds of clothing to wear (i.e. styles), but that men should at least WEAR a shirt, something to catch their perspiration and keep it from splashing all over.  (Something to keep their scraggly hair in place would keep perspiration from the head from spraying onto someone else's space, as well.)  I see the women wearing all sorts of shirts (tees, racerbacks, yoga tops, midriffs, etc) that allow them to feel most comfortable in such heated space, and the result is that I don't see any of their sweat invading the spaces of their neighbors.  Beth said she'd post something in the next newsletter suggesting that the men wear shirts, but after reading about four consecutive newsletters and seeing nothing written regarding my request, I gave up.    I guess my observations/suggestions didn't matter anymore since I'd signed up and paid for the next 25 passes.  It's been four months since my last conversation with Beth (I searched for my last Yelp check-in), and I still have 21 unused passes set to expire on July 24, 2012. --- 7/9/12  Beth Beary contacted me via Yelp email to let me know that she's extended the expiration date of my passes and asked me to not let one experience take my yoga practice away.  It was a good point, and I wrote her a note thanking her for the extension.  She's since posted a message (read below) reiterating what she told me, with the addition of her reason of not telling her patrons what to wear-- that due to the nature of the practice, she did not want people to overheat.  Are we women therefore S.O.L. because we cannot go topless, because that would be public indecency?  Have you seen many of the women who come to practice (most are lean and fit)?  Have you seen some of the men who come to your clinic??  Hmm...  As I've noted before, the female yogis show up wearing different styles, and the clothing helps to keep perspiration from splashing all over the place.  If you would just discontinue allowing the men to go topless, I guarantee you will find more practitioners staying on.  (I know of a former Floo-id practitioner who stopped going bec. of similar reasons I mentioned, and if she and I felt this way, then we can't be the only ones.)  Technically, you may fit 60 people in that room, but in a heated space and many bodies (of all shapes and sizes) present, people like their spaces and want to leave some room to allow themselves to be able to move their arms freely without hitting their neighbors.  Furthermore, once a class is underway, it usually is quite disruptive for someone to stop, pick up their mat, towel/s, and water bottle to find another space elsewhere.  Most of the classes I've attended here became very full and allowed just enough space for movement-- some of us have had to stagger our mats so as to allow limbs to move around without someone getting poked in the eye!  I find it ridiculous and somewhat condescending to say that the option of moving is available...

8/13/13  Went for a walk intending to shop at Trader Joe's and to check out Curry 'n Cakes (previously Cakes 'N Flakes), when I noticed there was a Great Harvest Bread next door to TJ's!  (I've bought bread from a couple of franchises in AZ years ago.)  I dutifully checked in to Great Harvest and entered the store to see if there were any bread loaves and sweet treats I could buy after shopping at TJ's.  It was great to see smiles on both of the employees manning the front.  One of them asked if she could help me and readily obliged when I asked to see the book of ingredients so that I may know which non-allergenic varieties I could take home with me.  The space was small, but cheerful and inviting.  (There were even a few tables to accommodate dining patrons!)  This store will be on my regular rotation whenever I visit The Queen City.

02/07/12  Met up w/ Violeta for happy hour today, and what a nice change in atmosphere from former Cafe Carumba's!  I really liked the all-glass wine closet display behind the host's desk- what a nice touch!  Cool indoor atmosphere/vibe, as well.  I wouldn't mind spending more happy hours here in the future.  I was hungry and thirsty, so I ordered two apps, the short rib sliders and roasted butternut squash ravioli w/ brown butter sage sauce, and a glass of their white wine blend, which had a bit of moscato in it.  Everything was very good!  I'd order all three again, most definitely.  Especially the ravioli and the glass of white blend.  :D  Hmm... I'm thinking another happy hour here is going on my calendar soon!

My first visit and I already know I'll be back for more!    Ncounter is on the corner of Mill and 3rd.  Metered street parking is available, but I used the parking garage farther down 3rd- first hour is free.  Large space packed with staggered tables to allow people to walk by, but I found it a little tight, and I'm petite!  There's a partition wall/counter that held the soda fountain and other accoutrements, and beyond that, more two- and four-top tables.  Lots of light shining through from so many glass windows- love it!  Ceiling fans were going full-blast; I couldn't find a table that offered respite from the strong breezes.  Ordering food entails lining up at the counter- not my favorite thing to do, but the process went quickly after I decided what to order.  Staff was very helpful and took time to double-check ingredients info for me.  I ordered the banana walnut pancakes and the Grilled cheese "Melt Down," with ciabatta bread instead of 12-grain (due to allergies).  Also ordered an iced mocha.  The banana walnut pancakes were delicious, and the pancakes had a nice texture! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ncounter-tempe?select=gpDF5uw_20j-D0gth23QLg#gpDF5uw_20j-D0gth23QLg  The bananas were a tad too ripe for my taste, but not too mushy I couldn't eat them, so I didn't complain.  I asked what kind of syrup it came with and was told "artificial syrup," and was offered desert honey, which had great flavor and went well with the pancakes.  I liked that the walnuts were plain and not candied.  I will have to try other varieties, as I am not looking forward to eating very soft slices of banana here again.  The grilled cheese sandwich was exquisite! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ncounter-tempe?select=qCkmJETFCMlS7adhlkIR5Q#qCkmJETFCMlS7adhlkIR5Q  Five kinds of cheeses (jack, cheddar, Swiss, American, and cream), jalapeños, and bacon, with tomatoes omitted.  Ciabatta was toasted and had great textures (crunch/crusty on the outside and soft underneath).  The slices of jalapeño gave this sandwich just enough heat and tang-- I wish I was back at Ncounter having another sandwich just writing about it!  The potato chips were good enough to add crunch, but I could've done without.  Gives me yet another reason to return- to try other sides!  Such great comfort food, I kept two thirds of the sandwich to take home and enjoy later.  Mom tried a small portion and ended up eating most of the leftovers!  That says a lot-- the sandwich kept well AND Mom enjoyed it, and it's hard to impress her with anything, especially with leftovers!!    The iced mocha was just OK.  A little watered down.  Hope I have better luck with other beverages next time, for there will be a next time... Mom has already requested more of the "Melt Down" for takeout.  :)

02/07/12  As V. mentioned in her review, we decided to take a rather nice walk from Tommy V's after having happy hour there to have a cuppa here.  Last time I visited this spot, it was called Solo.  While the skeleton of the cafe hasn't changed, I do like Cartel's version a tad bit more than the previous one.  I think the half-off pastries during happy hour had something to do with this...  :)    A shout-out to James and Ryan for being so nice and such sports for answering my questions.  Thanks for the awesome cup of cappuccino, no sugar, btw.  Loved the coffee art!  I'm definitely a fan.  I had such a nice first visit on the 7th that I returned here last night (Feb. 15th) to do a bit of work on my speech.  Two and a half hours flew by, and I most certainly would've hung out longer had I not received a call to pick someone up from work!  One thing I didn't enjoy so much, though, were the heavy, space-consuming metal "nesting" round tables I chose to set my laptop on.  I guess it wouldn't have been such a hindrance if I was doing anything else BUT typing away on my laptop, but I really didn't have a choice.  At least my tushy enjoyed the comfy cushions.  Guess everything balanced out. :)  Next time, I'll have to go for another cappuccino!  p.s.  A huge thanks to The Cure fan who decided to play a long playlist!  I had a lot of fun last night!

5/3/12   V. and I walked over here after a cool happy hour elsewhere, and this time I brought my beautiful cousin with us.  V and I ordered cappuccino (Cartel was out of V's favorite chai), while my cuzzo ordered an 8 oz. latte with honey.  I also spied a chocolate layer cake, and what?  It's half price during happy hour, you don't say?  Well, I'll have a slice then!   My cup arrived first, and it was a beauty, so cameras came out.  Soon after, V's and cuzzo's beverages and the cake arrived. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fa1G6WoSdvAO8dzM4FYbUA?select=oNUYZx9Eoo0dUE8Qa_lqkQ#oNUYZx9Eoo0dUE8Qa_lqkQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fa1G6WoSdvAO8dzM4FYbUA?select=4EqJGPxNYxB6-tek3iRPQA#4EqJGPxNYxB6-tek3iRPQA  I offered first bites- V declined and cousin dug in, but only to find that it was "a bit dry."  I concurred, but I figured I could just chase the bites down with sips of my delicious cappuccino.  V enjoyed hers, even though she forgot to have them add sugar.  (No biggie... she was able to add later.)  Cousin could hardly taste the honey in her latte, so she visited the sugar station.  She eventually had to abandon her drink when it became too sweet to finish-- all the honey she couldn't taste apparently had settled on the bottom.  I'm thinking this is going to be a tradition of mine when HH'ing in OTS.  :)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fa1G6WoSdvAO8dzM4FYbUA?select=WnJrcqqxqDUrVBJ6-70yUQ#WnJrcqqxqDUrVBJ6-70yUQ

7/11/12  Since the Yelp Magic Mike event, I've been back to see two movies- Ted on Tuesday ($5.50 for any movies starting after 10p) and The Amazing Spider-Man 3D ($12 for the 930p viewing) tonight.  The regular seats that fill the theaters here are actually quite comfy without foot rests for my 5'0" frame (although reclining seats would still be optimal!), and the seats are spacious enough to allow me to sit however I choose to do so, lotus position, or whatever.  For those of you with much longer legs than me, just grab a swivel-chair in front of you and use it as a foot rest; After the opening-day hype dies down, I'm sure this won't be a problem.  I don't know what kind of 3D technology this theater uses, but the pair of glasses handed to me was one of the better types I've come across.  And may I say kudos for the LARGE placard asking patrons not to walk out of the theater with them?  Of course, it would be nice if someone was actually manning the doors to retrieve the pairs (I hate recycling practically brand-new pairs of glasses when someone else can use them-- just wipe them off first, please!).  Hey, how about having a receptacle allowing us to drop them off?  I gave mine to a passing server outside the room.

7/28/12  Met with a few friends who'd already started drinking during happy hour (read 530p) and finished dinner before I arrived around 840p.  Serendipitously found a great parking spot across the front entrance.  I knew I wouldn't enjoy my stay here when I was hit by such loud chattering as soon as I opened the front door.  That and the scent of rancid beer that greeted me were enough to make me want to bolt, but I'd already let my friends know I'd arrived via text and Yelp check-in.  Found my friends at a four-top, sat down, and proceeded to shout hellos- strike three!  I REALLY dislike having to shout to a person who's sitting/standing right beside me to be heard.  What's even worse is having to nuzzle my ear to their mouth to understand what they're saying...  Really made me wish I was at mellow Four Peaks, already sipping on a cold pint of Peach ale and waiting on dinner to arrive.  I sat at that table for twenty minutes watching at least three different servers pass by without stopping to ask if I needed anything.  Thank goodness I brought my bottle of water with me, or I would've been really annoyed, because not only were my head and ears aching from the noise, but I was also hungry AND very thirsty, as well!  It was only around the 30-minute mark, while I and two other friends were standing by a landing of stairs did a server stop and ask if I had been helped.  By that time, I'd already made up my mind to leave and was already saying goodbye to my friends.  Too bad I couldn't get any love... 3 oz beer samplers are $1 or $2 (those designated with a plus sign).  Would've been a fun way to taste my way through the menu while checking out just how well the servers know the beers they offer- I'm a newbie to the world of beers, but I already know I don't like a lot of hops.  Pints are $5 each (boo!), but $9 per pitcher (awesome!), and that's not even happy hour prices!  A pint of local brewery Four Peaks is $5- what?  I expected to see a lot of O.H.S.O. brewery beers, but I only spotted TWO.  But I shouldn't have even bothered to study all of this since I never received service!

Bookmarked this place to try back in August 2013...  Cousin and I wanted to beat Easter weekend rush and went early, around 830a, but we shouldn't have worried.  SC is very spacious- I was expecting maybe 2/3 the indoor space, not including the large wrap-around patio seating (!!).  Really liked the dark-colored indoor furnishings, as well as those in the patio.  Service was friendly and attentive- we like that.  Cousin really appreciated that Sherry was not the hovering and talkative type.  I don't mind more conversation IF I initiate it, such as when I would like menu suggestions, in case I return; some background story on the establishment; or what the server could add to our meal observations, and not just simply repeating what we just said.  What I missed from conversing with Sherry, I received from Sheehan (?), when she came to top off my coffee; She reminded me of Parminder Nagra- so pretty!    I think I have found a rare breakfast place for me, where the menu has a nice balance of savory and sweet choices I can choose from.  Having tried all four types of pancakes and the awesome Chicken-fried Steak and Eggs AND enjoying all of them, I can't wait to try the rest of the menu.  The Granola raspberry pancakes took hold of cousin's attention and she just had to order them, but I couldn't decide between what I really wanted, the Lemon ricotta, and the Bacon blue (blueberries!), so thank goodness Sherry posed the question "Why not have one of each?"  What??  We can mix-and-match pancake choices?  Sign me up then! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soul-cafe-scottsdale?select=atgnWuPWIgdUVduv0ZKl0A#atgnWuPWIgdUVduv0ZKl0A  Hearing this option, cousin amended her order and asked to have one of the Applelicious pancakes, as well. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soul-cafe-scottsdale?select=AYnpLejZCAF9bY_cPdgdzg#AYnpLejZCAF9bY_cPdgdzg  I LOVE the textures of the pancakes here- how a mouthful can be crunchy, chewy, AND fluffy at the same time.  Oh, how can one not be amazed at the sizes of these cakes?!  They literally were as big as the plates they arrived on (and bigger than either of our heads)!  It's a great thing we could mix and match our choices, since cousin enjoyed the Applelicious more than the raspberry (only because the berries' seeds annoy her very much; she adored the granola), and I actually favored the Lemon ricotta best.  What were our faves and least fave?  Cousin- From fave to least fave: Apple; Razz; Blue; Lemon  Me- Lemon-ricotta (loved the cheese dollops!; be warned, preserved lemon rinds plentiful in this cake); Razz; Blue; Apple (did not impress me at all)  Be sure to carry your own 100% organic maple syrup, as Soul Cafe stocks up on artificial maple syrup (not warmed up, btw), as well as sells a mini-bottle of conventional pure maple syrup for $2.19 (I think that was the quoted price).  Cousin tried the house syrup and said it was OK.  And what about the Chicken-fried steak and eggs, you say?  Oh. My. Goodness, what a great entree!  First, it's rare to see 1. multi-colored potatoes on the plate, much less have them 2. perfectly roasted, and 3. taste spectacular without being over-seasoned.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soul-cafe-scottsdale?select=El4RNHqGiXe9TcrWz1p1oQ#El4RNHqGiXe9TcrWz1p1oQ  So what if the first roasted purple potato chunk oozed (olive?) oil when I picked it up with my fingers?  Most of the oil landed on the plate, and not in my mouth- good for me.  Oh, but how perfectly-buttered it tasted and how wonderful it felt to bite into it as I heard, and felt, the skin crunch and give way to the caramelized starchy goodness underneath!  The steak was juicy, the batter crispy (never turned soggy), the creamy gravy made w/ roux- all perfectly seasoned!  With months of hot weather coming and SC only 7 miles/10 minutes' drive away, I know I'll be returning often if the rest of the menu selections, as well as the good service, continue to impress.  Heck, if SC wasn't closed for the rest of Easter Sunday, I'd be taking my Mom here for dinner tonight once I pick her up from the airport.  I can't wait to treat her to breakfast here in a few days!  FYI, I had regular coffee (regular and decaf are the only selections on the menu), and it was strong and just what I needed, while cousin ordered hot cocoa, which smelled like the powdered mix variety to me- Carnation, or Swiss Miss?  Unlimited coffee refills.  SC has been around for 4 years, if I recall correctly- I hope the owners invest in a cappuccino maker soon.  With such a varied and ample food menu selection available, I was surprised that this "cafe" didn't offer any gourmet coffees.

Having dined here at least four times, twice at the bar, once at patio area, and once at an indoor table, I have to say that dining at the bar is the way to go.  It's livelier at the bar, as I may keep to myself, or chat with the people sitting next to me, which is what I did this afternoon!  I wasn't sure I'd dine in, but I knew I wanted to take home one of Grassroots homemade Coconut cream pie ($20). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grassroots-kitchen-and-tap-scottsdale?select=Z6WQVZ0It7zIJ8J6ePmwvw  Yessir!  One whole pie, please!  The bartender sounded so surprised!  He tried to get me to buy the pumpkin pie, as well (I'd called earlier to find out what the Pie of the Day was, and I was told there were two, so I was hoping to let fate decide...), but since pumpkin pie will have its spotlight in about fifteen days, I decided I'd go with the coconut, which was also what bartender said he'd rather have.    I decided I'd enjoy a $6 glass (during hh) of a Georgia Iced Tea (360 peach vodka, Appleton rum, peach puree, lemonade, and iced tea; SO good!) and try the $14 plate of Smoked Brisket, pickles on the side, please! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grassroots-kitchen-and-tap-scottsdale?select=50beHLTdqnZc1r2dRWtY3w  The cherry- and applewood-smoked brisket came with BBQ'd slaw, mayo, and local pickle chips (but not mine!) on a French baguette.  It was very tasty, but I kept wishing that the French baguette was more crisped on the outside.  The bread's texture felt like it was steamed-- too soft.  I originally ordered the sandwich to come with Pork belly baked beans, but when another guest asked what time it was, and I learned it was 5 pm, I asked if I could change my side order to a loaded baked potato, which is only available as a side from 5 pm onward.  No problem.  I only had a few forkfuls, but the toppings and large potato, crisped skin on the outside and fluffy on the inside, tasted great.  Saved most of it, as well as the other half of the smoked brisket sandwich for Mommy dearest.  It was a fun afternoon, with a refreshing peach beverage and delicious food, while chatting with the neighbors: Mary on my left, who was having a glass of chardonnay-- thank you for offering me a taste of your side of tasty coleslaw (!); and the couple on my right, who arrived after I'd received my entree-- it looked so enticing, and they'd never tried it, so they decided to share one.  I hope you two enjoyed it!  FYI, the kitchen couldn't, or wouldn't, let me have a thin slice of the pie to enjoy at the bar, so I had to wait till I arrived home to set up this money shot...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grassroots-kitchen-and-tap-scottsdale?select=ErJEo1UOxzJg8pIrXQaI-w

8/25/12  Met a friend here for my first breakfast at Dottie's.  I knew he was excited to try this location, since he'd been to the flagship in SF.  He told me to bring my appetite and warned that he was going to over-order, but I think we did breakfast just right! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dotties-true-blue-cafe-scottsdale?select=QA8KkDikOa6kjSROv7te6A#d3sa8tTy-MDlsNGtfoGc9w  It was a beautiful morning, with most of OTS's inhabitants seeming to still be in bed-- I quite enjoyed the open spaces and lack of pedestrian traffic as I parked into a lot right outside Dottie's front doors (we planned to meet at opening time 7:30a).  Michael was seated just a few minutes before, and I believe we were Dottie's first customers.  Found the interiors quaint- a diner atmosphere for sure, but cleaner, and definitely more inviting.  On my way to the restroom a few minutes later, I found that Dottie's has a second room, whose space seemed more peaceful, as I don't recall seeing a kitchen there, with cooks bustling about.  I mentioned to Michael about the second room, which surprised him, since the very room we were in was already a lot larger than the one he'd visited in SF.    Coffee was good, for a non-specialty blend (we were told it was a Shamrock Farms product), and we very much appreciated how our cups were filled constantly!  Excellent service by our server, whose name escapes me right now (starts with a "T," I think), even though I had to remind her about the whipped cream for our Peach cobbler crumble cake. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dotties-true-blue-cafe-scottsdale?select=pU0UjuOSuVWv03e03_g56Q#pU0UjuOSuVWv03e03_g56Q  The fresh-whipped cream arrived almost immediately, and was it a beauty! https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4120027511918&set=a.4107818566702.163328.1020200359&type=3  I wholeheartedly recommend others order this pastry should it ever find its way on the daily specials board again! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dotties-true-blue-cafe-scottsdale?select=P-eydevPkLcST4_L6W4nvA#P-eydevPkLcST4_L6W4nvA  While Michael ordered the Blueberry cornmeal hotcakes he's had to skip on his SF visit (they had pumpkin bread French toast on the menu then, hello!), I naturally gravitated to the Cinnamon roll French toast, hold the powdered sugar, with honey-cured ham and a fresh fruit cup. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dotties-true-blue-cafe-scottsdale?select=zlftv8fqh0KnEmmCuX6azw#zlftv8fqh0KnEmmCuX6azw  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dotties-true-blue-cafe-scottsdale?select=0cPhOrlomtoSQW1ERxB6TA#0cPhOrlomtoSQW1ERxB6TA  Another excellent dish, which I polished off almost immediately-- awesome combo of textures when combined with the terrific pure maple syrup (!!) served here.  Buddy, I hope you had more than the one piece I remember giving you... (I'm thinking I gave you two!)  I must say that I think that the entree should've had a couple more pieces of CR French toast on there.  ;)  Seriously, though, the photo (thanks to friend for adding them on here) looks like it's lacking something.  Buddy said "the powdered sugar," but I would've liked some mascarpone cream sauce, or a generous drizzle of creme anglais...  I couldn't try the fresh-baked Cinnamon roll (powdered sugar icing), but I did enjoy the bites I had of the Blueberry-white chocolate streusel muffin Mike had also ordered off the specials board.  The blueberries were HUGE and the white chocolate combo made for a very tender and moist cake, and the streusel topping added another great textural layer.  Mike "doesn't do leftovers," and so I was able to go home with some, and I will say that the peach cobbler crumble cake was just as good the next day, while not so much with the muffin... If I were you, I'd share that pastry with two or more companions, for it certainly won't keep.    We were given a sample of the sausage and biscuits, and while I enjoyed the spice level of the food, I wasn't too crazy about this dish, but I'm sure it's because my digestive system can't handle red and green bell peppers (although I can handle other peppers without problems).  However, I will say that the tiny bit of biscuit I had was very, very nice- tender, but not too much so, and flaky.  I'd order one or two on future visits, definitely.    Very fun breakfast, and I certainly wouldn't mind returning again!  :D

4.75 stars!  Stopped in the first time today to ask for suggestions of where to eat, since Farmer's Fork next door was closed on Mondays.  Sister and I already had plans to try this place after our visit to her alma mater Belmont Abbey College, so it was nice to find a personable and helpful clerk in Irene, who mentioned a few options that were nearby until settling on an eatery that had just opened recently (will post review and pics of that experience soon).  I made a mental note to return here to give our business as our way of showing gratitude to Irene for her friendly demeanor.  After our visits to the gardens and the college, my sister's GPS actually led us to the original Caravan Coffee & Dessert Bar in Belmont, and while the layout of the cafe, its furniture, menu boards, bar, and dessert case were very similar to this Mount Holly location, sister and I knew this wasn't the shop we visited in the morning, so I used the Yelp app to lead us here.  When we arrived, we found that manager Irene's shift had just ended and her daughter Rachel had taken over.  My initial disappointment of Irene leaving before we could visit again quickly dissipated after interacting with Rachel, who was bubbly and outgoing, and who shared our enthusiasm for tiramisu, exclaiming that Caravan's version was very good, and we whole-heartedly agree!  The cake was light and airy, the espresso flavor ample and delicious, and the mascarpone creamy, yet non-greasy and with just enough sweetness. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/caravan-coffee-and-dessert-bar-of-mt-holly-mount-holly?select=fGFRnVhaElp-0_BPKsmLoA#fGFRnVhaElp-0_BPKsmLoA  The chocolate cake was also delightful!  Not too sweet, and I just loved the dark chocolate flavor and textures of the ganache, filling, and cake layers. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/caravan-coffee-and-dessert-bar-of-mt-holly-mount-holly?select=RURd8aXZI6m-QBrUIvmn8A#RURd8aXZI6m-QBrUIvmn8A    Last, but not least, the mochas were beautiful and tasted divine!  They took longer than we expected, and I attributed it to the time it took for the sweetened milk to froth.  After a few minutes, I spotted Rachel spooning the froth into our "grande" -sized coffee cups.  She soon called me over to retrieve the first of the two mochas. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/caravan-coffee-and-dessert-bar-of-mt-holly-mount-holly?select=q3D9ZO84vXHYXzzL18hw5Q#q3D9ZO84vXHYXzzL18hw5Q  As if this work of art wasn't beautiful enough, Rachel presented us with another one! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/caravan-coffee-and-dessert-bar-of-mt-holly-mount-holly?select=QD-P1zrHjACtpjXLVh_TmQ#QD-P1zrHjACtpjXLVh_TmQ  Great mocha flavor (thanks to Ghirardelli dark chocolate syrup), and the sweetened milk froth added nice foam, although I did find it to be sweeter than I'd like.  Wouldn't stop me from ordering it again, though.  Thank you so much for making our first two visits so great, Irene and Rachel!

Smoked olives- Looked great, but I wanted to save room for mozza and griglia menu items! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crudo-phoenix-2?select=-0XG_gn3NAyh2BllGwAbIA  Grana spread: Loved this!  Really loved the granular texture, and the flavor and feel of the olive oil.  Might've been the only one who did.  Can't blame my friends... the other plates were quite scrumptious!  Crispy pigs' ears:  My first time trying this-- why did I wait so long???  These were wonderful!  Like chicharrones, but with meat, and the sweet peppers gave this dish a sweet kick!  Fresh Mozzarella, with bacon relish and caramelized onions.  Good, but would've been better if the mozza was a little more tender/silkier.  Bacon relish was the superstar in this one.  Straciatella, with battuto (root-based pico), hazelnuts, and radicchio.  I enjoyed the crushed hazelnuts over the creamy mozz.  Had to avoid the battuto due to carrot allergy.  https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crudo-phoenix-2?select=WzBcYltmikyduBWCyVvGIw  Ricotta, with walnut sauce and honey.  Another favorite of mine, for I am a lover of fresh ricotta that's well-made.  And walnuts.  And honey. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crudo-phoenix-2?select=Dz9DxRl2e94VzEHvxjxwQA  Brisket, with fingerlings, raddichio, and collatura ($19), with added Bonemarrow (+$5).  Found the brisket to be a bit too salty.  Fingerlings were excellent- crispy skin-on exterior, and fluffy interior... simply magical!  Really appreciated the bone marrow presentation (whole, uncut), which had a lot of meaty marrow that didn't make me feel like I was eating foamy oil on bread. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crudo-phoenix-2?select=HUGs_MRx5lKquEWRE5F8Pw  I had a two glasses (OK, a glass and a quarter) of the pinot noir on the happy hour menu.  Was able to sample this and one of the cabernets, and I surprised myself by favoring the pinot more.  The cab was a tad drier than I liked.  Yes, I want to return again soon.  Very, very soon.  Big thanks to Chef JK for recommending this place to me months ago, even though I'd had it bookmarked for years.  Why did I wait so long???  p.s.  Thanks to friends JY and DK for meeting me here-- what a fun evening!

8/16/12  Mom wanted burgers, so I searched Yelp for a gourmet burger place I'd bookmarked for awhile.  Arriving before Mom, sis, and nephew, I noticed that I was the only customer there for a late lunch (it was around 3:45p).  However, by the time the rest of my party arrived, another family had been seated.  I instantly liked the Hawai'ian surf theme, noticing the grass skirts, surfboards, and beautiful tandem bicycles on display.  The seating areas nearest to the entrance of the restaurant were quite warm (100-degree weather out there!), so we asked to be seated where it was coolest, and we were directed to the community table across the cash register, which was conveniently located near the kitchen and restroom areas.  There were many TVs adorning the walls, but they all played surfing videos, which was fine by me.  I can't recall even one of them playing anything else (news/ESPN), but I might have missed one or two...  Prior to my party's arrival, I had asked if the bar stocked Four Peaks' Peach ale.  I was told no, but that they carried Kiltlifter and 8th Street Ale.  John, one of the two males that seemed in charge (business partners?), offered to let me sample something similar I might like, and I already knew what he was going to say next... Mr. Pineapple.  I've never tried it, but I had spoken to a San Tan rep from a previous tasting elsewhere who had suggested I look for it.  After trying it here at RBT, I have to say I don't care for it, but I thank John for letting me sample it!    Since Mom and sis love mushroom and swiss burgers, they already knew what they wanted- rehab-sized (to share), on a pretzel bun, with sweet po"tot"oes.  There isn't a child's menu, perse, but our server John pointed out that there is a four-item "light bites" section (for those looking for healthier alternatives) my  nephew could choose from... We just ordered a "relapse" portion of the Bacon cheeseburger, with fries.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3l54GTr8-E3XPbIxnF_sAA?select=TfJ4J3w_9abK3A1nrK1NQA#TfJ4J3w_9abK3A1nrK1NQA  You should note that "relapse" burgers automatically come with brioche buns.  You may ask them to substitute wheat or pretzel buns, but these are meant to top 10 oz. patties, so your 5 oz patty will look tinier in one (which explains my chile burger photo). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3l54GTr8-E3XPbIxnF_sAA?select=wJNfZX6r6zkuwDFsu6wz0g#wJNfZX6r6zkuwDFsu6wz0g  The burgers were very good!  We all ordered them cooked medium, and they were juicy and tender, yet had a nice chew, and so flavorful.  A woman who came to check up on us said that they experimented a long time to find the patties they wanted to use at the resto.  My sister said that the burger was the best she's tasted in a very long time, if ever!  And Mom whispered to me a couple of days later that she "could've eaten the whole thing" herself!  While the sweet po"tot"oes were OK, they weren't as fun to eat as the French fries.  The fries must've been twice-cooked, for they were, to us, perfectly crispy, yet not crumbly-crisp that they disintegrated.  Nicely-seasoned-- not too salty.    Thanks to Ken for making a batch of Chocolate Lava milkshake for the kids present to sample.  My nephew wasn't interested in trying it, so I gladly took it.  I was expecting something frosty and thick, and this concoction just tasted and felt like a glass of chocolate milk.  I abandoned it after a couple of sips and just ate the tiny bar of Hershey's sitting on top... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3l54GTr8-E3XPbIxnF_sAA?select=_79QcNtx9XeSkE-AxlwQMg#_79QcNtx9XeSkE-AxlwQMg  Ken asked for my opinion, which was what I just wrote here, and he said I'd have to come in again and try one of their "adult" milkshakes.  I asked if they added Kahlua in it, and he said I'd have to come in and find out!  OK, challenge accepted!  Rehab, I think you're going to see us come in again very soon, so will you please stock up on Four Peaks' peach ale?  :)  p.s.  I love that the restroom (or at least the women's restroom) was stocked with white hand towels.  This lent a more welcoming feel to the place.  I like.  :)

09/26/12  3.5 stars.  For my second visit, I brought Mom, her two sisters, and a cousin along to take advantage of a Yelp deal I bought for Mom.  We couldn't sit at the community table we had enjoyed before, since it was reserved for another party, but we were able to get a five-top by getting two tables next to each other.  The weather was much cooler than on our first visit, so we were comfortable in that aspect; However, the music, which had gone from tropical/surfing sounds to loud contemporary/rap/rock music, so a few of us (at least an aunt and me) were annoyed.  Rehab now offers Four Peaks' Peach ale on tap!  Sheryl (sp?), our friendly and energetic server, informed me that the bar began to serve it this past Saturday-- hurray!!  I'm so happy this has come to pass, since I've only seen this peach ale offered at three other bars/restaurants BESIDES Four Peaks: Tempe's Lucky Break (during a Yelp event held there), Vincitorio's, and Mac's Grill and Bar.  Rehab offers $3 draughts during happy hour!  Be wary of their happy hour food menu pricing though, as they're only $1 off apps...  Since Mom and I had just eaten brunch right before our massage session, we weren't hungry, but I had planned on at least enjoying a half-pint of peach ale or a little bit of wine while my aunts and cousin enjoyed their burgers.  We decided to order the app Sheryl suggested, the Pigs' wings ($9/HH) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3l54GTr8-E3XPbIxnF_sAA?select=KZrg3VgZMoHE0xJgASMR8Q#KZrg3VgZMoHE0xJgASMR8Q, her favorite, which comes with a peach-habanero BBQ sauce made in-house.  An aunt spied calamari ($6.50/HH) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3l54GTr8-E3XPbIxnF_sAA?select=Ewn0r0HcfU9xW_7-481BgQ#Ewn0r0HcfU9xW_7-481BgQ on the menu, and since that is also Mom's favorite app, I asked Sheryl to bring some for the table, as well.  Mom and her two sisters decided to split two Rehab-sized burgers (mushroom and swiss, $11, and green chile hatch, $10.50) and their sides of fries and sweet po"tot"oes.  My young cousin thought she was ordering a sandwich when she went for the Chile Con Fritos ($8).  Since I had been disappointed with the chocolate milkshake sample we were given on our first visit, I decided I'd take up Ken's offer to try one of their alcoholic versions on this visit.  Ken was absent, however, so I asked bartender John what my options were, and we decided on a vanilla-based liqueur, Frangelico, and Kahlua concoction ($8).   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3l54GTr8-E3XPbIxnF_sAA?select=hP3IwyweWGHoAHexT4OhHw#hP3IwyweWGHoAHexT4OhHw  My aunts enjoyed the calamari!  The pigs' wings were also good-- I enjoyed the outer crispiness and the sweet spiciness of the sauce.  I don't think I'd order it again, though, and the same goes for the calamari, which weren't as crispy as I like them to be, plus I wasn't wowed by the "original marinara."  Personally, I'd just concentrate on the burgers.  I waited too long on trying the fries (as I mentioned, I wasn't hungry, and I concentrated on enjoying the sips of peach ale and the milkshake), for they were already soggy.  My aunt had sliced a portion of the hatch green chile burger for me to have, enough for two or three bites, and I still found it very tasty, even though I'd forgotten to add some chipotle aioli.  I don't think cousin enjoyed her Chile con Fritos, which didn't look very appetizing to me (and corn-based Fritos isn't something I can eat any longer) and she, the aunts, and my Mom didn't find the kitchen's idea of using a Fritos bag instead of an aluminum sheet to line the platter amusing.  I thought it showed Rehab's playful side, but you can't please everyone.  Come to think of it, I don't think it's wise to use a bag with so much ink as a liner when food's involved.  Hmm...  Last, but not least, the milkshake, which was much thicker, and that's a very good thing!  I enjoyed the first few sips, but the sweetness started to get too cloying by the mid-mark, and that's with all of us sampling.  I would only order this if I could share it with one or more people, and if I were to crave for alcoholic ice cream, I'll just head over to Lee's Cream Liquors!  :))  Props again to the management/owners on stocking up on Four Peaks Peach ale.  It's nice to patronize local bars/eateries local-based beverages and food!

02/07/13  Finally stopped by to visit Jeff at the new place-- I was a huge fan of Truckin' Good Food.  I was hoping to make it to the restaurant after my acupuncture session, but that ran long, and by the time I arrived here, it was already closing time.  However, Jeff did not send me home, even when I said I'd be back in the area in a couple of weeks.  He asked me if I drank coffee, and I said "yes, preferably black," but I also drink cappuccinos from time to time.  He asked me if I knew what a cannelle was, I said yes, and after setting me up with a mug of drip coffee, he went into the kitchen to surprise me with something fabulous.  (If you've met Jeff Kraus, you know he always has his thinking cap on, creating recipes of great-tasting food while you and he speak!)  While I waited for this lovely surprise, I surveyed my surroundings and admired the wall art, all made by local artists.  I fell in love with the counter backsplash the moment I laid eyes on it.  (Blue is one of my favorite colors.)  I really like the energy here, and I hope to return very soon to check out their dinner menu-- the resto re-opens at 5 pm, and last seating is at 730 pm.    The cannelle tasted fantastic!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?select=7WOcX83WBMjpC5twU_wRcg#7WOcX83WBMjpC5twU_wRcg  The pastry was caramelized on the outside and had a lovely "done" texture, while the inside was akin to a souffle's custard-like interior.  In fact, this product made me think of a deconstructed souffle.  The cake was sweet enough by itself and didn't need the extra vanilla glaze, nor the caramel sauce, but I tried them out anyway, since Jeff was generous enough to create them for me when he and crew should've been busy closing up shop in preparation for dinner later in a few hours.  I had the opportunity to meet a nice young man, Dylan Brabec,** whom Jeff introduced as part of the genius team responsible for the lovely photos (on Crepe Bar's FB page) and videos (I could not find this on FB, sorry!) of the recent latte throwdown held at Crepe Bar.  The photos portrayed a very fun occasion, of which I wished I was there to witness in person!  Thank you for your very kind hospitality, Jeff, and I WILL be back!  :)  **You may check out the latte throwdown video, as well as Dylan's collective team's other work, at royalanddesign.com.

4.5 stars. I finally had a chance to check out more of Jeff's tres fantastique crepes at this "new" location this morning.  Jeff was his warm-hearted and most-generous self, as usual.  After exchanging pleasantries with both Jeff and the staff, and Jeff notifying me of a change in the way he formulates his buckwheat crepes (now a combo of buckwheat and AP flour, and not the whole buckwheat of old), I decided to try the ham and gruyere buckwheat crepe, with an egg on top (additional charge), as well as "The First Time," filled with Nutella and sliced bananas and garnished with bruleed bananas, whole walnuts, and walnut shavings (!).  I chose a cup of CB's latest drip, the Burundi varietal Kiryama from Madcap Coffee.  (You may buy a 12 oz. bag from crepe bar for $16.99 plus tax, or from madcapcoffee.com for $15.50 plus tax and shipping.  Check out their FAQ link for two shipping options.)  It was such a lovely day that I elected to eat en plein air.  While I waited for my crepes to arrive, a delightful surprise was in store for me*, courtesy of the chef (didn't I say he is a generous soul?).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?select=6VW790O-IRvw2gs_gb5VUg#6VW790O-IRvw2gs_gb5VUg  This was Jeff's take on the strawberry shortcake.  Oh la la!  This dish was nothing short of a gift sent from above!  :)  The combination of the caramelized crunch of the sponge cake, charred in some spots, but not too much that I hastened to trim it off**, cream (my guess is a rustic mix of ricotta and mascarpone, but I'm sure I am wrong, for it was very light, and mascarpone can sometimes be a little too rich.  Not for me, personally, but for some...), fresh, sliced strawberries, a strawberry reduction (on the right), and a magnificent, and you're-such-a-tease tiny serving of a peanut butter reduction on the left (miracle!) left me speechless and dancing as I almost inhaled the plate!  Here's another vision of une beaute.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?select=CPdR8dECvp6oK6EyUSzkjQ#CPdR8dECvp6oK6EyUSzkjQ  But enough on the free stuff!  Let's get on with the stars of the show, the crepes!  I was originally ordering only a sweet crepe, but Jeff mentioned buckwheat, so I agreed, and it came with ham and gruyere, so I just rolled with it.  I can be loose like that, sometimes.  :)  I know that the use of mustard is very popular in recent years (and while I love mustard, it doesn't love me), so I asked if mustard was in the crepe's composition and was told that the crepe makeup itself didn't  contain mustard, but the vinaigrette dressing on the greens did, so Jeff said he'd omit it.  Instead, Jeff added pickled fennel.  I LOVE fennel!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?select=vhNkSUc1XmH-OwgrP899VA#vhNkSUc1XmH-OwgrP899VA  Oh, and since I was going with the flow this morning, I went with Jeff's suggestion of an egg on top.  If you love buckwheat, ham, and gruyere, then you must order this crepe NOW!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?select=QcNdkQMEQXf1U1YcdRRfmA#QcNdkQMEQXf1U1YcdRRfmA  My server came by to check on my progress of crepe consumption, estimating that I should be ready for the second crepe in a few minutes, but there's no way I'd finish this and have room for another, so I asked for a box.  She soon obliged with a sheet of aluminum foil and said she'd have the kitchen fire off The First Time.  Sacrebleu!  While the photo did not do it justice, the crepe's flavors and textures were extraordinaire!  Must. Try. Soon.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?select=DqpP0rGwFH6OPqU6jbh82A#DqpP0rGwFH6OPqU6jbh82A  Again, I couldn't finish the crepe, nor had I wanted to- not after the "amuse bouche" of a strawberry shortcake, half of a savory crepe and most of the egg (I don't eat charred edges), almost two cups of coffee***, and now half of this sweet not-so-little number, I was finished, and happy.  Very happy.  :)  It was a gorgeous addition to my happy memories of perfect breakfasts- thank you, Jeff and company!  *Jeff actually sent out teasers of the strawberry confection to other tables, not just mine. **The metabolism of charred food releases free radicals, which in turn may be hazardous to your health if you don't counteract with antioxidants- beware! ***I had to call my server back after her third, or fourth checkup to request for a coffee refill.  My coffee had grown cold, and not once was I asked if I needed more.  Otherwise, I'd have rated this experience five stars!

Came here two days in a row!  Yesterday, I met a GF for brunch.  It was her first time.  She noticed that the restaurant ordering and design exuded a European flair-- order at the counter, and self-serve napkins, cups, and sugar cubes.  (She didn't notice this at first, but staff didn't mind fetching the sugar cubes for her.)  She doesn't drink coffee and wanted English breakfast tea, so I let her use my free Maya tea with Yelp check-in.  She ordered the Papa K, while I went with a Mocha, made with 55% Valrhona chocolate and rose essence, and maple butter crepe (no surprise there). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=KPfw5w57yJTw3cudbjIwdw#KPfw5w57yJTw3cudbjIwdw  When Leah (one of the staff members) delivered my mocha, GF immediately ordered one for herself.  While we both thought the rose essence was a bit too strong, I finished mine and she abandoned hers (and ended up asking for just black coffee, instead).  Whether it was the additional food aromas/flavors mixing in with the rose essence, or just the mocha-rose combo mellowing over time, I was able to appreciate the beverage to the last drop.  GF tried another sip and said, "No.  Still too strong."  Her Papa K entree looked and sounded terrific!  I could hear the crunch of the top and edges as she sliced through the crepe with her knife.  She ate every bite of it! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=rQ0RK-WZDIeuPbzmHde01Q#rQ0RK-WZDIeuPbzmHde01Q  Her crepe also came with a side salad, dressed with a simple citrus vinaigrette.  I also ordered a choux, made with the same batter as a cream puff/profiterole, accompanied by date butter, and a brioche du jour, which came with date butter and macerated strawberries. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=bc_cBNSEyYy6jo5orkSlNA#bc_cBNSEyYy6jo5orkSlNA  I didn't care for the choux's soft textures, but I very much enjoyed the date butter!  I also loved the brioche.  So much so, that I ordered it again this morning...  Tastings for the day were sweet potato chips with salt, house-made yogurt with crushed hazelnuts and buckwheat streusel, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=CunzDO19CazGPrqPFfXJqw#CunzDO19CazGPrqPFfXJqw and house-made rollos. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=-YruYpBaXfdu_7LxWdUcmQ#-YruYpBaXfdu_7LxWdUcmQ  I almost didn't have my share of the rollos, as I was quite full from brunch, but GF made me eat it!  She said it was fantastic and that I had to try it.  Oh-kay!  :)  For this morning's adventure, two GFs and I met and ordered two breakfast burros, minus the guac http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=s8sQ2SOL3L_DN3VnaMr_pg#s8sQ2SOL3L_DN3VnaMr_pg and a vanilla bean crepe with strawberries.  Oh, why did I not take a photo of the sweet crepe??  I went with a pretty and tasty cup o' cappuccino http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=JT-wA12bXITpB92_hX6xeg#JT-wA12bXITpB92_hX6xeg, while the two had Maya lemon drop tea (with lemongrass).  I was able to tell one GF to take advantage of the free tea at Yelp check-in by downloading the app, but forgot to let the other one know, as she ran late and I had no time to tell her.  They both LOVED the tea!  So much so, I'll have to give it a try on my next visit.  I again ordered the brioche du jour, which hadn't changed from the day before.  This time, we all enjoyed it (GFs ooh'ed and ahh'ed!), while GF yesterday must've tried a bite of the toast sans date butter.  She only tasted sour berries, and apparently, she doesn't do sour.  Tastings for the day were sweet potato chips with date butter on the bottom, house-made yogurt and local Agritopia radishes, with fresh-ground black pepper and salt, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=FmFSjGiFVaIpuLi8rEGroA#FmFSjGiFVaIpuLi8rEGroA and two mini-flutes of rose hot cocoa (this time the rose/cocoa ratio was perfect!).  They originally came with popcorn bits, but Leah graciously made another one for me without them! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crêpe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=8wF7p4-0433ecIEXx6nAMw#8wF7p4-0433ecIEXx6nAMw  Thank you so much!  One friend left too early (had to go to work), while the other enjoyed all of the tastings.  She said it was one of the best meals she's had lately!  Kudos to Jeff K. and CB's staff!  We'll be back!

10/18/12  Enjoyed a wonderful happy hour at Davanti today- the first of many, I'm sure!  Great atmosphere, good food, and a cool bartender who kindly  brought me samples of two wines when I didn't know which one to try.  Be sure to order the Davanti burger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PswFC6CVWsKKTeh5knTnwA?select=WrtjTIi8IzkAGrMpSfCDdw#WrtjTIi8IzkAGrMpSfCDdw, so juicy and a good bargain at $8 (the accompanying matchstick fries was a "miss") and the "bruschette of the day," $5 during happy hour.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PswFC6CVWsKKTeh5knTnwA?select=nD0LtQ5y50K4nPlIWz1oyw#nD0LtQ5y50K4nPlIWz1oyw  House wines were $5 a glass, and thanks to the cute bartender, I enjoyed the glass of Montepulciano he kindly let me sample first.  I did try the house buffalo chicken wings http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PswFC6CVWsKKTeh5knTnwA?select=46I2ZXm3BfJVsn81p115SA#46I2ZXm3BfJVsn81p115SA that were highly-touted by my bartender/server, but I didn't quite enjoy it as much as the other two items.    I hope to return to explore the dinner menu soon!

09/29/13  I had to wait till Restaurant Week was over to visit and use my expiring Local Dines certificate here.  (Perhaps I'll try CB on a future RW.)  This restaurant has such a great atmosphere-- I would hate to see it close down... I stopped by after work (around 815p), and there were maybe only eight diners there, including me.  :(  I'm sorry to say I forget the server's name, but he was friendly and helpful- another plus.  (I was fortunate to attend a Gatsby-themed event here earlier in the year, and I was very impressed with the welcome and great treatment we were given here.  The atmosphere was very fun, and the open sight lines (open kitchen, bar, wine closets, restroom areas, and design of the restaurant were perfect for the occasion!)  I'd look for him when I visit again, but something tells me that everyone here know how to treat guests well.  I really do hope to see a busier CB in the future!  Enough about the atmosphere and service already and let's get to the food!  I decided I'd order the $13 Purple Potato pizza (mozz, gorgonzola, purple potato, leeks, bacon) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/central-bistro-phoenix-2?select=Q1VQ6HI7G_wLhQ5ghdK08g#Q1VQ6HI7G_wLhQ5ghdK08g, $12 Central Burger (fried shoestring onions, gruyere, and frites) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/central-bistro-phoenix-2?select=Xb1125wtIn3jpIFzFBfnJg#Xb1125wtIn3jpIFzFBfnJg, and $10 Chocolate Layer Cake. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/central-bistro-phoenix-2?select=eI3Br0fwcAyN1yBk3I1CFA#eI3Br0fwcAyN1yBk3I1CFA  First, I must say that everything I tasted was, yes, amazing!  I believe that this was the second time I've ever had potatoes on a pizza, and as was the case with my first experience, I find potatoes on a pizza to be quite a game-changer!  This pizza was gorgeous-- I loved the colorful impact that the purple potatoes gave to the pizza, and, even more importantly, the foodorgasms I'd fall blissfully into with every violaceous bite! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/central-bistro-phoenix-2?select=e_DOX2w9XRpbNE6uF3m1ng#e_DOX2w9XRpbNE6uF3m1ng  The gorgonzola and bacon pairing just pushed this pizza over-the-edge... A definite must-try!  (This pizza also reheats very well.)  The burger was also a terrific find-- the patty was cooked to a perfect medium (red center) and very juicy and so flavorful, the gruyere creamy and luscious.  My only complaints were that the onion shoestrings were unnecessary, and the fries were presented in the style of frites, which means if you don't forget to gently slide them out of the receptacle and onto some paper napkins, you'll end up with a soggy mess in under two minutes.  The challah bun was a great pairing, as well.  All in all, two delectable meals.  Speaking of meals, the chocolate layer cake could be three meals by itself!  This six-layer cake was colossal and sat on top of what surprisingly looked and felt like the consistency of room-temperature evaporated milk, and tasted like it, too- a slight disappointment.  A bigger drag was that it was served cold, and therefore not as flavorful as it could've been.  Please don't misunderstand- the few bites I had were appetizing, but not as palatable as the bites of leftovers I had in the days after.  A big win was the dollop of creme fraiche on top, with garnishes of blueberries, sliced strawberries, and mint.  I'd order this again, to come out with the entrees (to allow to warm up to room temp), and share with others.  Can't wait to go back for more scrumptious food, maybe some wine, good service, and to enjoy the inviting and beautiful atmosphere!

12/13/12  Nice space!  Let me rephrase that-- very cool-looking bar counter, but the rest of the room was too open, with low four-tops in the middle of the main room and high two- to four-tops next to bare walls and near the bar area.  It felt a little disconcerting...  Upon entering the restaurant, I immediately gravitated to the bar counter, where the choicest seats seemed to be.  The bartender there was friendly and eager to tell me all about the beers offered here.  After being able to sample one of the beers (sorry, none of the ones listed online sounded familiar), I decided to go with a glass of Malm Sonoma pinot noir ($10).  A pet peeve of mine is having to drink wine from a beer glass- not cool, but I got over it.  I started off with the Braised Pork Belly, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=IxQZJrjKInhC-mVb9TCd1g#IxQZJrjKInhC-mVb9TCd1g which came charred (grr!) and sitting on top of a delightful silky bed of (not cloyingly) sweet yam puree, and garnished with Brussels sprouts slaw and maple syrup.  I expected the pork belly to have a little more crunch after seeing all that char, but it was almost too tender.  It tasted quite lovely, but I preferred the pork belly that Roka Akor used to serve (I hear it's not on the menu, anymore?).  I really enjoyed the yam puree's contribution to the dish-- it was almost jammy.  Still, at $10, I'm going to skip it next time (and resolve to look for it on my next trip to Roka Akor!).  For my main, I had the Braised Duck Leg, $13, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=aUDb-8nR1pDZroVx1gHiHQ#aUDb-8nR1pDZroVx1gHiHQ which was a work of art!  Gorgeous colors and a MYRIAD of textures and flavors, it is definitely a dish I would order again and again!  The duck was crispy and very delicious- one of the best pieces of duck I've ever had the pleasure of tasting!  I especially enjoyed the crispy mung bean cake upon which the leg was placed on.  (Being Asian, I am familiar with mung beans- red, yellow, and green, to name a few, so to see this ingredient used in a novel way in American cuisine was exciting!)  I so loved the big bursts of ginger flavor in the cake-- I wish to see this item on more menus- at least as a substitute for crispy polenta, or risotto.  The sweet soy had almost a balsamic twist to it.  I whole-heartedly recommend this dish!  To finish, I ordered the Apple Turnover, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=4bSitqEOaCaP4SvbuyJb6A#4bSitqEOaCaP4SvbuyJb6A with vanilla-bean ice cream, $6- a special of that day, which required I wait an extra twenty minutes to bake-- I do not mind waiting for freshly-baked pastries!  This delightfully-flaky turnover arrived atop a rivulet of beautiful caramel sauce, piping-hot tender spiced apple slices inside, a dollop of creme fraiche, and apple matchsticks on top.  All of this was garnished with toasted pine nuts... Exquisite, and yes, I ate it all!    Since I arrived during happy hour, I was able to get a $1 off each item.  I found the tab a bit pricey ($46, including an $8 tip), but I did have wonderful leftovers for lunch at work the next day-- everyone kept eyeing what I was eating and asked where I found it on the buffet spread!  As if!  :)  I'll absolutely be back! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=AFu1PBeqCLa2A1NVFXRwbA#AFu1PBeqCLa2A1NVFXRwbA

Stopped by to check out the place and ask if the ice cream flavors were made with corn syrup (yes).  However, the nice man, whose name is Terry, took the time to tell me about their products, and I became very interested in their custom-roasted beans from Miscela d'Oro.  Terry kindly obliged to let me sample a "cortadito," http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petersens-old-fashion-ice-cream-scottsdale-2?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA#tmGvi9oRu0JNOri3JpKT7w a taste of cortado, a single espresso mixed with (sweetened) milk.  Now, I usually drink my coffee black, preferring to glean calories off of sweet pastries, pancakes, and waffles instead, so I was glad that Terry had not told me that he was going to add the sweet milk-- I most likely would've skipped it!  The cortadito was a beauty to look at and so velvety and luscious, that I savored each and every sip.  After a delightful chat, I continued on to visit a favorite coffee shop nearby and the second of three breakfast stops for sweets.  An hour or two later, I walked back to Petersen's to buy a cup of drip coffee to help me finish off a few more sweet bites.  I'm definitely coming back to have a cortado!  (And maybe buy a chocolate-dipped waffle cone to complement.)

5/29/13  Winding down from the CMYE at Del Frisco's, someone brought up an impromptu UYE at Snoh Ice Shavery, and since I've never been and had been craving for shave ice, such as that I experienced in Honolulu, I needed no other prompting to go.  Snoh is located in the same plaza as Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe (another bookmark I've had since moving into the valley many, many years ago- now I know where it's located, I'm going to have to stop in for a try!)  Parking looks very decent for the number of businesses around here- a big plus!  The line can get long very fast, but the two guys behind the counter take the orders very quickly (or as quickly as they can when newbies, such as myself, come in for the first time and are faced with so many choices!).  I decided to take the easy way out and try a couple of shaved ice flavors and a few toppings, so I went with the "large plate" for $6.75.  I spent my first decade, born and raised, in Manila, so I am very familiar with taro (we Tagalogs know it as "ube") ice cream, so I had to try Snoh's icy version, and added Green tea to the mix.  My toppings were cubed mango, red mung beans, and black sesame condensed milk.  It took about 8 to 10 minutes, but we had a large group present, and our lively conversations made the wait very easy.  This is what waited for me at the counter when my name was called... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/snoh-ice-shavery-phoenix?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA#jyv16LcyCFb3Cz-Q3CkDxg  I have to say that while it didn't look very appetizing (mango cubes didn't present well, and neither did the black sesame drizzle-- why not just pour the milk, let it cascade down the icy landscapes, and just sprinkle roasted black sesame seeds on top?), I loved the taro, red mung bean, and black sesame condensed milk combo.  I thought the condensed milk overpowered the green tea ice, and I wouldn't order that match again.  However, I wouldn't mind having ust green tea ice.  It tasted very fresh and clean-- a great palate cleanser after a great meal.  Cool artwork and backsplashes.  Nice concept of posting photos of guests on the TV display, but does the staff check for total complacency of all those present in the pics, I wonder?  I can see privacy breaches becoming an issue...   Will be taking family over for a few treats here in the future, I'm sure!

Decided I'd try a longtime bookmark while "in the area."  (It took me 27 minutes to drive from Tempe's SWIHA to Gilbert's Rise Up Bakery, and then another four minutes to Zappone's.)  I'm so glad I did!  I was promptly greeted at the door, and I inquired if I had to sit at the bar to enjoy the happy hour menu, or would I be able to sit anywhere, and the greeter said I could sit anywhere.  I almost sat at the bar, but it's such as small space (five or six high bar chairs), and I didn't want to sit with my back to the front entrance, so I chose to sit at a red leather-backed booth/four-top.  Slightly dark indoors, but not too dark to drive me away.  I eat with my eyes as well as my mouth, y'know.  Happy hour menu features a $1 off house cocktails, $4 glasses of house wines, $4 well drinks, $3 drafts, 15% off wine bottles, a few $5 apps, a $5 Caesar salad, and a $3 bowl of "warm olives."  A shout-out to server Caressa, who made me feel so welcome; She was friendly, patient, and understanding in regards to my questions regarding food allergies.  No negative vibes here!  She also took my requests to sample three wines (a house red, a house white, and Cannon Ball Chardonnay-- I went with the $8 glass of Chardonnay). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=XVYmbangVxnZOzyg1iEY7A  Because of the terrific customer service shown to me, I decided I'd go with three courses:  Jake's Mac-n-Cheese, $5. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=vLtofR0wyZ6f_C4IiaCf8QLoved this dish featuring alfredo, mozzarella on penne and topped with pancetta!  Smoky and cheesy, and a lovely bite/chew from the penne, and a great value! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=s7n3g1f5GGZen1IDEA1gBA  Sausage & Onion Pizza, $5. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=Ab8QiySsWeWb65xnsbcuWwSo what if it looked like it might be soggy from the marinara sauce and its crust a bit thicker than I'd like it to be?  It had Italian sausage (from Chicago) on it- it had to be good!  And it was!  Enjoyed a small slice of the eight-inch pizza and had the rest boxed, for I was about to enjoy the second course... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=DVDNPddHFaJZwbvSG8PsHw  Fettuccine Alfredo, with chicken, $16. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=c1-3ilR_MHMxirPZJu8Z0AI chose this entree, because it was one of two pasta entrees that did not include marinara** as an ingredient, it also featured one of the two pasta varieties made in-house!  (The other is ravioli.)  The sauce was silky smooth (no clumps!) and just salty enough to make me reach for "just one more" forkful.  Didn't feel greasy, either.  One of the best Alfredos I've had, and I'd definitely order it again. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=Ra4JlgX22HJRwTNnxLEPXw  I could've ended the meal there- I certainly ate more than I wanted, but the cheesecake was calling my name...   Mascarpone cheesecake, with blueberry compote, $6. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=MfPbCAC7dtAvz-eaVGtz7gThe desserts are made in-house, with the exception of the gelato and sorbettos, which come from Italy.  Couldn't try the sfogliatelle and cannoli due to the powdered sugar content, so cheesecake it had to be, and I was THRILLED!  It was beautiful to look at, fun to photograph, and very delightful to eat.  It had this golden-brown top layer that was so gratifying to cut through with a fork, and perfect-to-me center that was neither too firm, nor too whipped, and a not-very-sweet graham cracker crust.  The blueberry topping was exquisite!  I cannot gush about this sweet concoction enough!  I contemplated on taking a whole cheesecake home ($36) and appeased myself by planning on ordering one for Christmas, should Mom and I get an invitation to lunch/dinner.  While the holiday catering menu only listed Peppermint chocolate cheesecake as the only dessert option, Carissa told me I could ask for any flavor I wanted.  I quite fancied the one I tried tonight! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=1RuD3bxX6bS1FVpfTs3TAw  Miscela d'Oro Americano, $2.50, with $0.50 refills. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=jghr9T7Vkuc_crNbYO4bAw  Feast of the Seven Fishes menu, Dec. 9th, 6pm, $50 all-inclusive!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=vT6GnHLad0qXRDnqLBIudg Holiday Pre-sale menu! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zappones-italian-bistro-gilbert?select=DuFrbCx-KnD7ROUxpK4Qfg  FYI, Zappone's also offers weekly dine-in specials!  $6 Spaghetti & meatballs with house salad on Mondays and Tuesdays; 50% off all wine bottles, all day Wednesdays; and Buy one pizza and get 50% off second pizza all day Thursdays.

6/22/13  4 stars for my first visit to Giant Rustic Pizza!  Prior to my call for takeout, I called to ask a few questions regarding allergy issues I have with corn- does GRP use corn meal in the production of the crusts?  How about in the oven?  (Some restaurants don't use corn meal to help add crunch to their crusts, but a LOT of places use it to keep the bottoms of the pizzas from sticking to the oven floor, and this sadly keeps me from enjoying past favorites and from trying new places that are on everyone's list of bookmarks.  I'm happy to report that GRP does not use corn meal at all.  The person on the phone was very helpful in answering my questions, and for those that he couldn't answer himself, he offered to ask those in the kitchen who could.  After we hung up, I continued to look over GRP's webpage and decided I'd order the 14" Big Sky (cheese with five toppings) for $15 plus tax.  I normally forgo red-sauced pizzas, but something told me to try one of each, so I went for two orders of Big Sky- a white pizza with ricotta, spinach, artichokes, seasoned feta, and garlic, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/giant-rustic-pizza-scottsdale?select=VP28FVb81R7KblTMVv_nDw#VP28FVb81R7KblTMVv_nDw and a red pizza with Italian sausage, pepperoni, ricotta, spinach, and artichokes. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/giant-rustic-pizza-scottsdale?select=9QDrj92eJNOydcrH78tYCQ#9QDrj92eJNOydcrH78tYCQ  I vaguely remember saying something like "Oh, but these photos online of the crusts don't look like thin-crusts to me," to which the GRP rep said, "but we can do thin-crusts, if you'd like."  Oh, yes I do! The phone rep was calm and did not seem to be in any rush and answered all of my questions.  This surprised me, since I thought the more people they could rush orders through on the phone, the more pizzas they could be baking and selling.  I suppose I'm just like many people who are used to rude service on the phone.  Thank you, GRP for being different!  :)  When I walked in to retrieve my pizzas, the two people at the cash registers were very welcoming and had big smiles for me.  Greeting customers with smiles sounds so simple, and yet this single act alone can make the receiver of the smile feel like a $100!  The staff at GRP also make it a point to open the pizza boxes to show you what your pizzas look like, and to see if they meet your approval.  These looked and smelled AMAZING, and when I got home, I found that they also tasted divine!  A little too heavy on the ricotta, but I will never complain about too much ricotta, since I can always take some off, but too little is something to whine about...  Each pizza had their merits, and I wholeheartedly recommend ordering pizzas with red sauce from here.  I am a die-hard white pizza fan, so when I tell you the red sauce is good here, you better believe it!  During my first ten years of life in Manila, I ate SO many sweet Filipino-style spaghetti, and while they were delicious enough for me, I do not favor sweet pasta sauce anymore.  GRP's is very tasty, tangy, and zesty.  I also enjoyed the white pizza-- I recommend adding the feta for a little kick, since the ricotta can be a little sweet.

I've passed by this spire, on foot and in cars, for years, but I only found the water fountain a few months ago while on a stroll. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frank-lloyd-wright-spire-scottsdale?select=sKiua623YZpCKgcfsnCHmA#sKiua623YZpCKgcfsnCHmA  Why I never spotted it before, I don't know, but I'm glad I found it.  Now, when I'm in the area, I try to make it a point to visit, for it is so pretty and tranquil here, even amidst parking lots and heavy traffic on Scottsdale Rd.

Meant to stop in for happy hour apps and cocktail, but instead tried their Restaurant Week $30 three-course menu (app, entree, and dessert) and a glass of house wine (cabernet or pinot grigio), or draft.  I decided to try the Goat cheese-stuffed Peppadews, the Malbec burger (comes with Salut fries), and Chocolate cake, with a glass of cabernet to compliment the burger.  I've had peppadews stuffed with goat cheese before (at Fez), so I knew these would be tasty.  The peppers were raw (as opposed to the roasted peppadews at Fez, or that's how I recall them to be, anyway), so they added crunch to the experience, and were stuffed with a sweetened goat cheese filling, then sprinkled with herbs and drizzled with a very mild-tasting vegetable oil.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=H7ExguXj2xipVp4CTDxM4Q#H7ExguXj2xipVp4CTDxM4Q  I ate two of the four peppadews (to pace myself for the coming burger and dessert...).  I ordered the Malbec burger without mushrooms and tomatoes (allergies), and while Maham forgot to ask how I liked the temperature, she said she asked for medium ("red in the center"), but the burger arrived without any hints of pinkness at all.  However, it was still juicy and tender.  The bun was good- looked and tasted like it may be supplied from a local bakery.  Without the mushrooms and tomatoes to temper the sweetness from the caramelized onions, this burger tasted almost too sweet.  No matter- I just took a few Salut fries, shoestring fries topped with feta and parmesan, which leant the saltiness to counter the sweet onions.  Loved the citrus vinaigrette drizzle on the fries- YUM!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=AiLPBPynnsej5zssNM6x1g#AiLPBPynnsej5zssNM6x1g  For dessert, I had my choice of S'mores, cheesecake, or chocolate cake, and I almost can never say no to chocolate cake, especially when the description mentions a drizzle of both chocolate and white chocolate sauces, but as you can see, my dessert only came with a dark chocolate drizzle.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=58Yym4133_Nrx9H61x2M4A#58Yym4133_Nrx9H61x2M4A  My sadness was only fleeting, as I tasted my first bite... oh, this cake tasted definitely of homemade dark chocolate batter, sauce, and ganache filling and frosting!  (No use of powdered sugar, cornstarch, or corn syrup- I asked!)  One of the best-tasting chocolate layered cakes I've tasted in a long time, complete with semi-sweet mini-chocolate chips on the outside edge...  Not very sweet, so I ate about half of it- oops!  :)  I hadn't planned on participating in Restaurant Week this season, but I'm glad to be able to recommend Salut's participation.  Thank you, Salut and Maham, for making RW fun again!

5/23/13  I bookmarked Renegade a few months ago, but didn't have the inclination to go until I decided to try takeout from Stone & Vine and spotted Renegade next door.  I already planned to try Renegade after Restaurant Week ended, so imagine my surprise to find an invitation via text last night to attend today's Grand Opening VIP Tasting!  (I'd just arrived from a terrific RW dinner at Sassi when I received the text.)  I received the confirmation email this morning asking guests to arrive in casual attire.  Arrived before the place started to get crowded.  Spied a couple of old acquaintances, and we decided to sit together.  (Had a great time catching up with you, Chris and Heather!)  Glad we moved to a table close to the musicians playing at the front- Jared Blackstone sang and played guitar, while another would join in on keyboards from time to time.  He did covers ranging from Rob Thomas and Johnny Cash to Pearl Jam and The Beatles.  So good was the music tonight that Heather and I went and bought CDs.  I hope he's on regular rotation at Renegade...  Before moving to the table, we sat at the bar, where Heather and I immediately were given ribbon-tied plastic bags filled with fruit-infused rum cocktails finished with Kool-Aid.  I couldn't have any, so I gave mine to Chris.  At the table, Heather ordered a glass of Earthquake Zin, and I a Rosemary Margarita, which had an ice cube made up of a rosebud and rosemary sprigs!  So delicate and very pretty, yet packed quite a punch! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/renegade-by-mod-scottsdale?select=_fcCyNNVYAMPDoCmi9NkHw#_fcCyNNVYAMPDoCmi9NkHw  Here's what we sampled...  Venison lollipops dusted with dry mole http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/renegade-by-mod-scottsdale?select=4KVXnXAm8j3t-5VBet-dEg#4KVXnXAm8j3t-5VBet-dEg Kale + chard kimchi Braunschweiger pate http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/renegade-by-mod-scottsdale?select=zCmu8ZtaPwVtHjFnUQl-rA#zCmu8ZtaPwVtHjFnUQl-rA Heirloom tomato, soy beans and crab gazpacho http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/renegade-by-mod-scottsdale?select=QhJZy8WOJTojb9f3x9Dj8w#QhJZy8WOJTojb9f3x9Dj8w Mini-waffle cone filled with mango pudding http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/renegade-by-mod-scottsdale?select=GRzQZJ7h1kzxHAp0BW7Gxw#GRzQZJ7h1kzxHAp0BW7Gxw Crab mac 'n cheese http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/renegade-by-mod-scottsdale#w1v6-PF0tYC5NfZ3RfXeyQ Black bean hummus & raw veggies http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/renegade-by-mod-scottsdale?select=GBDdAENiERWBeQJnZGLYUQ#GBDdAENiERWBeQJnZGLYUQ (too sour!) MOD 'N Sour pork wings and Slider "MODS" Kobe beef and bufalo sweet chili sloppy joes with Velveeta http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/renegade-by-mod-scottsdale?select=RLohz8wYTXLR8e-ZCouEMg#RLohz8wYTXLR8e-ZCouEMg Flavored goat cheese cream under smoke-fennel pollen essence http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/renegade-by-mod-scottsdale?select=TCq1A2-aLJTJD0ABfZsXGQ#TCq1A2-aLJTJD0ABfZsXGQ  My faves were the venison lollipops, kimchi pate (on duck-scented black bread!), pork wings (not too sour or sweet- perfect!), Kobe beef sloppy joe sliders, mango pudding mini-cones, crab mac 'n cheese, and of course, the winner of the evening-- flavored goat cheese cream served on ashtrays!  The first serving I had, I concentrated on the different flavors and textures of the sweet dish-- smoky fennel mixing with the creamy goat cheese, and the nutty fennel pollen amidst the silky goat cheese cream- oh la la!  We were practically begging for more!  When we finally got seconds of it, a server actually brought out a covered smoking tray, stopped in front of our table, waited till it dawned on us what we were about to receive, and then lifted the cover, and out drifted smoke!  This time, the fennel pollen tasted even smokier than the first batch, and then I finally had to stop and shake my head, because darn it, I'm eating out of an ashtray!  I'm sure it painted quite a picture to see me, a non-smoker who abhors the habit (I work in a smoke-infested environment), eating out of an ashtray with glee!  We each took a parting gift of Mole Gold 24K gold-infused EVOO and a set of headphones in a paint can on our way out, and I asked the artist I'd passed a couple of times on my way to the restroom, he had an unfinished canvas next to him, if he was responsible for some of the artwork adorning the walls; he said yes.  He is Lalo Cota, and he's painted some of the murals here, as well as the ceiling of one of the dining rooms, and has done artwork at PHX's District American Kitchen and Wine Bar.   I shall return!  p.s.  Also tried a tough pork belly and two Big Azz burger lollipops (one good, the second not so).

4.5 stars!  Today was my second visit, and I like this eatery!   The ambience is laid-back, despite the gorgeous marble bar counter, distinctive winery flourishes (I looked for beer taps,  but didn't see any), including cut-out kegs doubling as decorative shelves, and one flat-panel TV (this isn't a sports bar). Matt and Shawn (the latter had been the former manager of neighbor Four Peaks) are gracious as  always.  Chef Indy remembered me from my first visit, as the guest who ordered the spare ribs without the BBQ sauce and the chocolate bread pudding, which he made a chocolate ganache especially for me, because I couldn't have the regular chocolate sauce laced with corn syrup.  This afternoon's dishes all tasted terrific, and I enjoyed the textures:  Calamari app- Menu says $10, and 3.5 weeks ago was half-off during happy hour.  Menu still lists the price at $10, but my receipt said $9, with $2 off during HH.  Loved the crunch!  The calamari was prepared just the way I like calamari to be, and I know Mom would love it, as well.  The accompanying garlic aioli and marinara were great, as well, with the aioli being a little saltier than I'd prefer.  My only gripe is that for $9 original price, I didn't get a lot of calamari, so I'd only order it during HH...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=Tc4nAKLyAECUuNVzJH0o2w#Tc4nAKLyAECUuNVzJH0o2w  Twisted Burger- $14, and comes with house fries.  Matt had told me about TR's mac 'n cheese more than three weeks ago and said that he could sub it for the fries, if I wanted.  The burger came with brie, perfectly-crisped thick bacon (!), arugula, and tomato jam, which I'd asked for on the side.  It's made with sun-dried tomatoes in a white wine and sugar reduction.  It added a definite sweetness to the burger and complemented it well, but for someone with inflammation issues, I'd skip it next time.  (Tomatoes, part of the nightshade family, is one of many inflammatory foods.)  The mac 'n cheese was DELICIOUS!  Today's preparation consisted of cheddar, parmesan, and provolone, and a little bacon.  I had to stop myself from eating too much!  Again, this dish is a little pricey for me, especially since I can't have the tomato jam...  The great quality of the mac 'n cheese kind of makes up for the price, just a little.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=SAuXcPnQ-Quc8EI3W6e2uQ#SAuXcPnQ-Quc8EI3W6e2uQ and http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=AZl3l-786NTEWyX8ephxKg#AZl3l-786NTEWyX8ephxKg  Double Chocolate Lava Cake- $8, and usually comes with vanilla ice cream, which contained corn syrup that I can't have, so  Chef Indy (sp?) offered to whip up some fresh heavy cream and granulated sugar.  He also offered to make a caramel sauce when I asked if instead of whipped cream, I could have some creme anglaise.  He wasn't sure which of the two I wanted, so he decided to give me both!  After the first bite of one lava cake, though, I knew the whipped cream and the caramel sauce were not needed.  This dessert should be called Better Than Sex, and really, what better metaphors for sex are there but volcanoes and lava, eh?  And boy, was this dark chocolate lava hot, thick, and decadent!  I'm getting excited just thinking about it!  ;)  I'm sorry I didn't take a photo of the lava oozing out... I couldn't stop eating to take other photos...  If only there weren't other people present, I'd have licked that plate clean!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=fLYO4YN5-mYty5nbRGvlFw#fLYO4YN5-mYty5nbRGvlFw  Btw, Thursday night is Ladies' Night, which means happy hour* deals ALL DAY for women.  Also, live music entertainment is held from 6p to 9p.  I enjoyed it, and so did the other women who filled up the main dining room.  *Happy hour deals changed since my last visit three and a half weeks ago.  It used to feature half-off appetizers, but now it's just $2 off the apps.  There are wine specials, too, both by the glass and bottles.  If you feel like splurging, try the Sexual Chocolate by Slo Down Vines, $45.  Very good!

3.5 stars.  Came in for dinner on 3/31/16.  First time since bookmarking when it opened a few years ago!  The decor and ambience inside felt a little "off."  A divider screen, or two, could help out in parceling the two "rooms" (dining/deli-display cases and racks and fridges of wine and other beverages.  (I just spied Mark R.'s review on my upper right and he hit the nail on the head when he wrote "Looks like this place was an old 7/11 at one time... like a small convenience store with the scent of a French bakery in the air.")  Walking around- looking at the dessert and cheese display cases, dry goods on shelves- and then walking over to the table I chose (the community one nearest the bottles of wine by the wall, it felt like I was walking from one world into another- like crossing an abyss.  I arrived during happy hour, so I was able to try the Vegetable Frites app (orig. $8, but $5 during hh) and a glass of Domaine de Fontsainte Corbieres for $5 ($2 off glasses of wine).  From the dinner menu, I chose the Steak Frites ($18), perfectly-seared medium-rare sliced hanger steak and delicious mixed fries.  I'm allergic to mustard, so the kitchen swapped out the Dijon mustard for garlic mayonnaise.  The vegetable frites were beautiful to look at and so much fun to eat! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/french-grocery-phoenix?select=fFuG8cQ9-ASu129kBkrtLA  Lightly-battered** and flash-fried pieces of onion, asparagus spears, haricot vert, and red bell pepper served with garlic mayonnaise.  I'd order this appetizer again.  The steak & frites were also equally-great! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/french-grocery-phoenix?select=VS54sdtZsGJXv5LWJz9sKw  I used to enjoy medium-rare cooked meats when I was younger (grade school through mid-20s), but found that I rather appreciated a medium-cooked texture and flavor as I got older, but this hanger steak was perfection!  So great was the flavor and sear, that I worked hard to stop myself at eating half to save the other half for Mom to try.  (I left it for her to try that evening, but then ate it all the next evening, saying to myself "you snooze, you lose!")  I was able to sample a taste of the Savary Epineuil Bourgogne Rouge, a pinot ($10) before settling on the Corbieres, a Carignan wine.  It was served slightly-cold and was refreshing to drink by itself, though it paired well with the hanger steak and veggie frites.  It also was lovely to sip in between teaspoon servings of silky and rich chocolat pot de creme ($5.95). https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/french-grocery-phoenix?select=XLXFgweFOay4i5YWtisHmw  Shh!  I just had a scooped a rounded-teaspoonful of it before starting this review, and it still felt and tasted fantastique!  (My fridge cools items well.)  Loved speaking with Willy at the wine and dessert counters (thanks for the Carignan suggestion!) and handsome owner Kevin, who gave me detailed descriptions- preparation and presentation- of the veggie frites and Steak Frites.  Even Chef Beau came out a couple of times to see if I were enjoying the food.  Why, yes.  Yes, I was!  Loved the great service and seeing their enthusiasm and dedication to what they're offering.  I would love to return again soon and try other items on the menu, and I hope to be able to upgrade my rating to solid four or five stars... I feel a little re-arranging would fix the discord I sensed inside the French Grocery.  **The vegetable frites' light batter contained cornstarch, which gave the veggies a great crunch without being heavy nor tasting too greasy.  I did pay for messing with corn (allergy), with abdominal pain and a slight headache all night, and a rash on my face the next day.

Beautiful room!  Gorgeous fall colors!  I adored my king-sized bed, with a playful cream-colored leather-backed headboard, and side tables equipped with table AND reading lamps (and four power outlets- I counted- just on these lamps). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vee-quiva-hotel-and-casino-laveen?select=nm8Erzz3Fev_qWSmbL_4qw#nm8Erzz3Fev_qWSmbL_4qw   The pillows and bedding were delightful... I'll have to see if I may order online to own (some hotels offer this option).  The room didn't have a bathtub, but I appreciated the spacious glass-encased shower.  One complaint was that the water pooled around an inch and a half to two inches as I showered, but quickly drained when the shower was turned off.  I'm hoping the stall floor, drain cap, and pipes are kept as clean as possible... The desk had a great leather pad that served well for both as a rest for my laptop, as well as a mousepad.  There's a table lamp that dims, but I noticed a high-pitched and constant noise soon after I turned it on and while on the computer, and on first guess turned the lamp off, and the noise was gone.  Maybe I'll say something to those at the front desk.  Gorgeous picture and sound qualities from the Samsung Smart TV!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vee-quiva-hotel-and-casino-laveen?select=f8xKcy4fI2GLi1I3Ldn67A#f8xKcy4fI2GLi1I3Ldn67A  I just finished watching "We Bought A Zoo" this morning, even though I've already seen it two times previously, because it seemed like I was seeing and hearing a new version of it due to the TV's HD technology.  (I wonder if this is how it feels to watch movies on Blu-Ray?)  The scenes seemed to leap out of the screen, almost 3D.  I wish I could afford to get one of these.    Housekeeping wasn't able to straighten up my room yesterday, since I had just returned from my morning swim and needed to shower and dress for the day.  Speaking of the pool... it was small (smaller than the one at my apartment complex), but it was gorgeous!  I loved how it had a wade pool for very small children on one end.  And it was heated!  I was hoping that the pool wasn't as bad as one Yelper had posted (very small and not heated).  Thank goodness this matter was resolved since.  See the magic of taking the time to craft these reviews?  Forward-looking management do take reviewers' observations and complaints to heart!  There's a jacuzzi, but I didn't use it.  Lovely cabanas and I am a lover of the mountain views we have in this valley, so I was deliriously happy both when I was at the pool and when I was inside my room looking out!  Oh, and very important-- my skin and hair didn't take on a chlorine smell, and I didn't detect the scent while swimming, either.  My morning exercise was a very pleasant experience.  Thank you, VQ.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vee-quiva-hotel-and-casino-laveen?select=Ql8ubJJdO4HLAL3DX4EMQg#Ql8ubJJdO4HLAL3DX4EMQg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vee-quiva-hotel-and-casino-laveen?select=ZmVBPJaNCTDDVtJOLzjcGw#ZmVBPJaNCTDDVtJOLzjcGw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vee-quiva-hotel-and-casino-laveen?select=B7nCal78HsvA2-N5T4W_QQ#B7nCal78HsvA2-N5T4W_QQ  The casino floor was spacious and easy to navigate through.  The Square Bar was easy to find and indeed square in shape.  I thought the ventilation did a great job keeping the casino as clean-smelling as possible!  Wish I could say the same where I work.  :(  I dropped by the VQ Live lounge last night and listened to a few songs by Latino band Str8up, who is on regular rotation.  They do a range of musical styles, and I was impressed with the female singer (the only female in the group, and the only one I heard singing) as she sang a Fleetwood Mac cover.  Lovely voice!  Everywhere I went, the staff were friendly and eager to assist with whatever concerns I had, and I didn't have many.  I didn't order anything from Cafe 24/7, but VQ really scored big having Los Reyes de la Torta move in!  I am tempted to skip getting breakfast (my most favorite of all meals) from a local Ahwatukee eatery  after checking out and just get another sandwich from here...

I've dined here for over a year now, and I don't know why I haven't written a review yet!  I gave up sitting at the booths- I don't like lining up to order.  I just saddle up to the bar and get quick service there.  Aside from creating my own burger, I can only order one of their twelve crafted burgers without having to omit key ingredients.  All of the rest either have sauces that contain cornstarch, or corn syrup (sassy and steak sauces), too hot to even consider (El Diablo), or have items I am allergic to.  Yes, I can ask for them to omit these items, but then all that is left is the burger patty and bread!  So it's the Llano Poblano for me. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hopdoddy-burger-bar-scottsdale?select=lAFmVsT17iI25nVUvualDg#lAFmVsT17iI25nVUvualDg  A bit greasy due to the grilled poblano and slices of bacon, but very delicious!  The brioche is nice, but I'd like to try it with whole wheat next time.  (If I should ever feel like going for The Classic, I might as well wait for it to go on special-- classic burger and soda for $10, but I'd sub something else for the soda.)  I also tried the delicious Peach Cobbler milkshake special, which goes off the specials board this Sunday to make room for a new selection.  If you like peaches and pies, then you will LOVE this.  Peach puree and marinated peaches (in triple sec, I'm told), homemade caramel sauce, and pie crust** mixed in Hopdoddy's vanilla ice cream base.  Go and get some before it's too late!    Oh, and many thanks to Jesse for delivering on my request for ice-cold Oak Creek Nut Brown. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hopdoddy-burger-bar-scottsdale?select=DBsmT8GBMoxGjQgo_Qs9kA#DBsmT8GBMoxGjQgo_Qs9kA  I only enjoy beers when they're so cold there are ice crystals in them.  Check back for the photos, which I'll add in a few days.  The frosted glass was gorgeous!  **Made especially for this milkshake.  Hopdoddy's dessert menu only features milkshakes and nothing else.  I really enjoy the one made with Nutella and chocolate-covered pretzels!

We were in line for the Belgian waffle bake to raise funds for St. Mary's Food Bank just outside Chocolade van Brugge, but the line was moving so slowly, so we decided to just check out CvB and head to a nearby restaurant for some cocktails.  I initially went in to have a look around while the others were in line and was impressed at the display of truffles, in particular the dark chocolates.  Going back out there and seeing that the waffle toppings were just Hershey's chocolate sauce (contains corn syrup), brown sugar, canned whip cream, and caramel sauce (most likely made with corn syrup), I opined that perhaps we should just skip the waffles and go for truffles, instead.  It didn't take much to twist their arms...  13 truffles and $25 lighter later, I walked with Marian to store our truffles in their cooler in the car and returned to meet with the others just in time as a nice young woman came around handing out dark chocolate strawberry and amaretto truffles to sample!  We all chose the amaretto, and they were d'lish!    $2.50 per truffle, four for $9, eight for $18, and twelve to thirteen for $25, and that's about as much as I cared to memorize.  Everyone who checked in on Yelp got 10%, plus a coupon for 5% off on the next visit.  On our walk to store the truffles in the car, I told Marian I wished the coupon was for another 10% off on the second visit, to which Marian replied "that would be dangerous."  I suppose so... Lord knows we don't need any more reasons to splurge on sweets, nor waste any more money on said sweets!  p.s.  I wanted to wait till I got home to take a photo of the truffles, but I couldn't help myself and had one of the coffee truffles in the car on the way back-- oh, my!  So, so good, and I really liked the sound of the break and the way the chocolate reveals the creamy center in the middle.  Excellent dark chocolate flavor, with slight floral notes, and the coconut flavor was good, not overpowering at all, and not cloyingly sweet, either.  Overall a great truffle.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chocolade-van-brugge-scottsdale?select=pcVhwmJsYWsI86ot_pWl0w#l03MT4wk94uykczc0mFWwg --- p.p.s.  Fred, who'd assisted me with info on the chocolates and what goes into them (no corn syrup, all-natural, no "flavorings"), sent me an email thanking me for my review and to clarify that he actually made all of the sauces (he specifically mentioned the chocolate and caramel) without corn syrup.  I hope CvB holds another Belgian waffle event soon, so that I may try these homemade sauces.

Was quoted 45 minutes to an hour, but delivery arrived in thirty minutes- nice!  First time ordering anything from China Jade, and I chose delivery, which required a $15 minimum purchase.  Don't know why I assumed delivery would be free- perhaps it's because most places either quote a delivery charge upfront, or offer it free with a minimum purchase.  In any case, delivery was an additional $1.50- whew!  I don't know... something about seeing additional charges when I wasn't expecting any, especially AFTER I've already paid and tipped... Well, it just was a little surprising.  It would be nice to know about these extra charges somewhere on the takeout/delivery menu, yes?   I ordered beef lo mein, BBQ spare ribs, and Hot and crispy beef- all very delicious! http://www.yelp.com/biz_user_photos/sYDc1TENwCKLHvprBa5rLw  The noodles were prepared well, not greasy, and the pieces of beef were lean and not sinewy at all; the ribs had a pleasing chew and were tasty, yet not overly-seasoned, nor sloppy/sticky with sauce; and the hot and crispy beef delivered on the crispy (yes!), without being greasy, had slight salty and sweet flavors to it, and the chili oil indeed added a spicy kick, even though the meat was flavorful without it.  (Enjoyed the steamed, yet crispy broccoli that accompanied this entree!)  Thank goodness the lo mein paired well with all the meats, since I am not able to eat rice without risking allergic reactions.  I have found my go-to Chinese restaurant!  Hope dining in is just as pleasant.  #700

Met with Linda W. at Nook yesterday- it was both our first time there.  Sat at one of the circular half-booths that line the wall, at which one end terminates at a wine cellar and the other at the entrance.  The noise level was jarring at first, and made me wish we'd kept the initial offering of a booth closer to the entrance (less noisy), but after a few minutes' of adjustment, our central booth with a great view of the bar and kitchen just opposite was a nice choice.  There is a HUGE step up to get into the booth (about eight inches), so be careful as you step down.  I was wearing a mini-skirt and thought I could just slide off the seat onto the floor, but I forgot about all of that space...  When I come back to Nook, I won't be wearing a mini-skirt!  :)  Our server Alice was very personable and easily shared her faves when prompted.  I commented that she knew "her stuff," and she quickly came back with "except about the cornstarch," referring to the queries I had regarding certain menu items.  Now, onto our happy hour selections:  Linda ordered a $2 pint of Kronenbourg 1664, a pale lager made in Strasbourg, France.  It smelled fruity, which I welcomed, but it had enough of a hoppy flavor for me to dislike.  However, Linda liked it a lot.  She ordered the $5 Poutine, which consisted of house-cut fries, mozzarella curds, and beef gravy (made with cornstarch) and added a fried egg for an extra $2.  If you are part of a group of three or more, I suggest to get TWO fried eggs added!  We didn't have the problem of very soggy fries due to the beef gravy arriving in a separate bowl. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=nz1KtnNBoqgYiwokAbqKKQ#nz1KtnNBoqgYiwokAbqKKQ  Her other selections were the $5 Caprese bruschetta, which I didn't try (I'm avoiding inflammatory foods, such as tomatoes), http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=Ujg_pGder-78HkVW2ZYPTA#Ujg_pGder-78HkVW2ZYPTA and the $5 Arancini, which were mozzarella and red pepper risotto balls, battered and fried, and placed on a bed of marinara sauce and balsamic drizzle.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=LdcmR5wLzqm1eyno_g38_A#LdcmR5wLzqm1eyno_g38_A  I said the heck with my rice allergy and tried one and found it mild and creamy, with a nice aroma from the red bell peppers.  Glad I tried it!  Since I didn't enjoy the Kronenbourg sample Alice brought me, I asked for a glass of the 10 Span Pinot noir, which was drier than I prefer, but paired alright with the Beer-braised pork butt bruschetta; That is, until I later sampled the 10 Span Pinot gris, which made for a heavenly match with said app.  The pulled pork came with a "secret BBQ sauce," which was slightly sweet and more importantly, free of corn syrup and mustard, two ingredients that keep me from ordering anything that usually comes with BBQ sauce.  Wait till you take a bite of the pork and coleslaw... oh my goodness!  The sourness from the coleslaw cuts the sweetness of the sauce and makes the app so much fun to eat.  Better than foreplay, I tell ya!  ;) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=xTAc8Lwz804Do8tdHQj9xg#xTAc8Lwz804Do8tdHQj9xg  The $7 Fig bruschetta was very good, arriving with smoked prosciutto, goat cheese, and an asparagus spear, all sprinkled with herbs.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=l9TYtf4Or2WEOr369_zJFQ#l9TYtf4Or2WEOr369_zJFQ  Order this if you want to keep it light, yet tasty.    The piece de resistance for me was the $8 Bread & butter bread pudding, which came with an apple-cranberry compote and caramel ice cream on top, a Tracey Dempsey creation. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=GLY1jPWqO5mH9uSUIsAHsA#GLY1jPWqO5mH9uSUIsAHsA  The compote I could do without, as I found it to be too sour, but the caramel ice cream and warm bread pudding combo was orgasmic!  I even had a spoonful of cold bread pudding leftovers this morning and was still amazed by the flavor and textures.  The flavor was eggy, which made me think this could make for a great French toast (too bad Nook doesn't offer breakfast service), but what took this bread pudding over the top for me was the tres leches flavor of the custard.  I will most certainly order this dessert again!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=ivZlqH9o6nDnSu7PC3U-zw#ivZlqH9o6nDnSu7PC3U-zw  Kudos to Nook for the delightful flavors and laid-back, yet sexy atmosphere, and to Alice for great service!

This is my first visit to the new hotel and casino.  On my way from work to the hotel, I called up reservations to ask what my dining options were at this time of the night (arriving at 8:30p) and was told that I had Ditka's (steakhouse), the 24/7 Cafe, and the food court, where I could find Panda Express, Fat Burger, and Los Reyes de la Torta.  As soon as I heard "Los Reyes," I knew where I would go for dinner.  :)  After studying the three menu boards overhead (a shorter list of their regular selection of tortas, aka sandwiches, and tacos) and concentrating on the tortas board, I considered two options: Cubana and the Carne Asada.  I ordered the Cubana (ham, sliced roasted pork loin, melted cheese, jalapenos, onions, and minus the avocado, and served with refried beans) since that was what grabbed my attention the most.  I was told my wait would be around 10 minutes, so I went to the Players Club to get a reprint of my card, should I ever get the itch to gamble during my stay.  (I found out the unused free slot play I'd received when I first applied for my card years ago was only good for the first 24 hours, so I was not able to get a re-issue of that free play- darn!  However, if you play nice, you can always get something comped.  :)  Thank you, Patrick!)  After getting a new copy of my card, I made a quick stop at the Square Bar for a glass of wine, and then headed to LR to retrieve my to-go order**.  A styrofoam box with my name on it was waiting for me, and while I dropped off my claim ticket, I asked where I'd find the utensils and was told it was at the cubicle next to me (couldn't see it because I was approaching the pick-up section from the left and the divider kept me from seeing the utensils, condiments, wet naps, and napkins, which were to my right).  The tables are cafeteria-style, so just grab one that looks clean.  This sandwich, which came with ridged potato chips, was HUGE!  I expected refried beans goop, but these were actually whole beans scooped onto the bottom of the sandwich, upon which sliced ham, white cheese, sliced pork, tomatoes, sauteed seasoned onions, and jalapeños were added.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-reyes-de-la-torta-laveen?select=XmayEHOPKoQE1L20R-H1jQ#XmayEHOPKoQE1L20R-H1jQ  The telera roll was toasted and buttered- so delicious!  It was all I could do not to eat the whole thing, and I am accustomed to eating light at every meal.  I ate so much that I don't think I'll need to eat breakfast before heading for my morning swim... With Dunkin' Donuts coffee and Munchkins to tempt me, however, I may just have to force myself to have a few bites!  ;)  **  I should've just gone with "dining in" option, since I knew that I didn't have a refrigerator in my room.  However, I had planned to look for a bar to order a drink, since LR didn't serve alcoholic beverages, and I didn't want to leave my food open to the elements.  Thank goodness I went with the boxed option, since there are flies in the cafeteria-- disgusting!

First time at this location.  Ordered takeout- Chipotle chicken lavosh pizza and Caramelized cauliflower with tahini.  First time trying these two items and both were excellent!  Loved the spice level from the chipotle peppers and the crispy thin cracker crust. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pita-jungle-scottsdale-4?select=Tv4kvK22UxTVZgKT7tctRg#Tv4kvK22UxTVZgKT7tctRg  I tend to stay away from tomatoes (inflammatory food), but I wasn't planning on doing anything special after eating, so I tried a few bites without picking them out, and they were so tender and tangy- just perfect!  I know that cauliflower can be lovely when properly attended to, but these blew my mind! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pita-jungle-scottsdale-4?select=nvzKkWzsX5C3XLj6LhllfA#nvzKkWzsX5C3XLj6LhllfA  The florets were tender, yet crisped, with a delicate balance of slight bitterness and salt.  The silky tahini sauce that they poured on top had a faint sweetness from the caramelized florets and onions, and last, but not least, the pine nuts complemented the cauliflower and tahini dish.  Just eat these with the lavosh crust leftover from the pizza slices, or order some pita to enjoy with.  Can't wait to come back and order these again, as well as try other menu items!

6/5/15  Happy hour?  More like a peaceful hour at Pita Jungle on a Friday afternoon, but it's definitely more what I like, which is to enjoy food in peace.  No guys banging on the counter with their beer glasses, thank you very much!  Enjoyed a nice chit-chat with bartender Matt as I drank half a glass of the house cabernet and picked through the five $2 happy hour tapas plates (olives, feta, lemon chicken, hummus trio, and falafel), plus a side of caramelized cauliflower, I ordered that day.  Not a bad way to spend $10 on five tapas plates, although I probably wouldn't order the chicken, or the hummus trio again.  Surprise winner were the olives and feta combo-- they went well together, with the tang of the feta mellowing out the saltiness of the olives.  Nice to nibble on while having a glass of wine!  The cauliflower was a little of a letdown for me, as the tahini sauce that came with it wasn't enough, although the manager personally-delivered a nice bowl of freshly-made sauce on short order.  I was very impressed... thank you!  :)  The flavors weren't fully-expressed in that dish that afternoon, but after a couple of days marinating in the fridge, the florets I ate today at 3 am were d'lish!  This PJ location is small, yet intimate, with a nice semi-enclosed patio seating surrounded by a parking lot.  I hear lunch time here can get hectic!  UPDATE 6/10/15 The lemon chicken is actually quite tasty when it isn't being compared to all the other bites I had for hh.  Just finished the last of the leftovers with a little bit of pita a couple of minutes ago.  I even added a kalamata olive and a tiny chunk of feta into the mix- delicious!  May have to order the chicken again for hh another time.  Going to upgrade the rating to a four, since service was attentive and the leftover food still tasted great three days later!

Heard that Tom opened a frozen custard shop in Tempe a few days ago, so I decided to check it out after my massage last Wednesday.  The shop just opened up a month ago, and he's still getting signage to come in (lists of toppings and cones, etc.).  Tom encouraged me to try as many flavors as I wanted, so I tried:  Key Lime- excellent!  Sweet and tart, and very refreshing!  My fave of all that I tried, so I bought a pint to take home.  However, I'm exhibiting allergic symptoms every time I eat it- must be the natural flavoring.  I'll need more research.  ;)  Mocha Bean- good, but I wouldn't suggest it after trying an acidic fruity one, like key lime, as the coffee/chocolate will taste "a little off" (my words).  Strawberry- delicious!  And I try to avoid strawberry due to an allergy, yet I ordered this to go into a waffle cone- see photo.  You can see the strawberry puree mixed in the frozen custard.  Vanilla- also very tasty.  Wish I could try some of the toppings, or even just hot fudge mixed in, like a thick milkshake, but the candy bar toppings I saw, as well as the commercial hot fudge that GFC stock and use contain corn syrup and other corn derivatives.  Black Cherry- excellent, and with whole black cherries in the mix!  I don't know why I didn't take a pint home with me... :'(  The following flavors I took home with me without sampling first:  Cinnamon bun- Oh my!  This tasted just like a great cinnamon roll!  It's very rich, though, so I suggest having it in small doses.  Contains real cinnamon- a must-try!  :))  Banana- made with banana puree.  Very good, as well.  Not as sweet as Ben & Jerry's banana ice cream base in Chunky Monkey.  Maybe you can order this with added hot fudge and nuts?    **Coffee Bean- I'm very partial to coffee ice cream, but GFC's offering is solid.  **Orange Creamsicle- I could definitely taste orange and cream, and I liked the flavor.  I was hesitant to try it, because of my orange allergy, and I wasn't sure if this frozen custard flavor contained actual puree or just flavoring.  Doesn't matter, though, since all "natural flavors" are derived from corn.    Please note that frozen custard contains more egg yolks AND less air than traditional ice cream, so every flavor will taste richer and creamier and have a denser mouth-feel, and this decadence is not for everyone- my Mom, for example.  (Store-brand ice cream often do not contain eggs, and, forgive the tangent, usually contain corn syrup!  I've had premium ice cream, both organic and non-, that contained egg yolks.)  Some of Glen's Frozen Custard flavors do contain corn syrup, such as chocolate, raspberry, and butterscotch, the latter of which is Tom's favorite flavor, and he's trying to talk me into tasting it "at least once!"    Btw, the fruity sorbet flavors are blends of frozen custard and "sherbet."  The Key lime, however, tasted and felt like sorbet- very light and cooling-- I felt like I was on a tropical vacation.  :)    Would I come back if I didn't have food allergy issues?  A resounding yes!  I wish Tom and his family great success with this franchise.  I really wish Tom great success so that he will open non-GMO frozen custard shops in the future.  ;)  ** Denotes complimentary items I received.  Thank you for your generosity, Tom!

6/4/15  Cute bar (with lime lighting on the underside of the counter).  Appreciated the purse hooks on the counter wall underneath, as well.  Nice patio seating and bar placement.  It's rare that I feel out of place dining at a restaurant; Although the clientele that day was a multi-generational mix, I felt that the restaurant is leaning towards a younger crowd with their young bartenders, servers, and manager-on-duty.    I ordered a Skinny B margarita (made with house tequila- Sauza Reposada?- fresh lime juice, and agave syrup) and the chicken enchiladas, subbing flour tortillas for the corn tacos, for happy hour ($2 off specific cocktails, beer, and wine specials, as well as appetizer and taco specials).  Complimentary chips and salsa fresca-- I was the first guest to ask for flour tortilla chips and try them here!  The chips and salsa were good, and so was the margarita.  I DID NOT care for the enchiladas at all; the green sauce (was that were all the spinach went?} was almost unpalatable.  Don't know why I ate as much as I did- around half of the two rolls.  Did not bother taking the rest home.  I also tried the bread pudding, which came with strawberries and a sweetened tequila sauce.  It wasn't anything special, but it was very warm and the sauce creamy, which is something I look for in a bread pudding. The dessert rang under $7 and was the largest serving I ordered at S&L.  I ate about 1/6 of the serving and took the rest home.  It's still sitting in the fridge, untouched.  Probably should just toss it away, as it's been four days...  Didn't feel well by the time I arrived home, and I went straight home and did not pass go.  It's not the first time I had half of a cocktail/glass of wine after getting a massage, but I'm sure it had to do with the combo of tequila and everything I ate; Possibly the green enchiladas and/or the tequila components of both the margarita and bread pudding, who knows?  Maybe I'll give Salt & Lime another go, but it won't be anytime soon.

Fun concept, but I now know I am not one for secret movie nights!  I think going in knowing that a movie might be one of three listed down might work for me, but definitely not secret cinema.  I just didn't enjoy watching "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure."  I somehow missed it the first time it was released on screen, or perhaps I already thought it was so bad then that I had blocked it from memory, but the only scenes I recalled had to have been those included in trailer shots, or during 80s trivia.    Thank you Yelp for paying for my first taste of Woodchuck Pumpkin hard cider-- delicious stuff!  I'm keeping an eye out for it on drink menus from now on.**  The bar, off to one side, is cool.  The space can get pretty crowded, though, so I don't think I'd hang around that area.  Nice to order drinks from and just go directly into the cinema.  Again, thanks to Yelp for the Yelp grab bag of free candy, which I gave to a friend.  His son devoured the candy, or so I heard.  It was a fun event, but not something I'd drive 45 minutes (construction and rush hour traffic) for again.  I was dreading that "Psycho" was going to be tonight's choice, and now I wished it was!  Heck, I'd have liked to see "The Green Mile" again...  --- 12/04/14 UPDATE:  Found Woodchuck pumpkin hard cider at Bev Mo'.  I believe it was $9.99** for six- 12 oz bottles.  Woodchuck offers MANY hard cider varieties-- at least six, I'd maybe even say eight, or more!

I was looking for a breakfast place to try on Friday when I stumbled onto Delice.  I decided I'd send in my usual questions regarding my corn allergy & which pastries (I had a list!), crepes, & other items could I try in an email to their FB site around 1 am on 5/21, & I received a reply, w/ exciting answers & a welcome to visit just 8 hours later!  Most of the pastries that piqued my interest were powdered sugar-free & only received their dusting after baking, so whoever replied (unsigned) told me to let them know when I was visiting (Friday!) & to ask for Master Baker Matt, who'll have the pastries ready for me.  Friday morn, I received an email that asked around what time would I arrive.  I said I was leaving in a few minutes.  When I arrived around a quarter to 10 am, Maddie had already helped me locate a public garage nearby & let me know that parking will be validated (up to $4).  After greeting Maddie in person & meeting Master Baker Matt, who then told me that my pastries were almost ready, I placed in an order for an Eggs & Sausage crepe (on Maddie's referral), a medium-sized mocha (fyi, espressos here are made w/ Illy brand espresso) & a Bananas Foster French toast.  I'd asked her if there were other nuts that could be subbed for pecans, since I'm allergic, & there was a bit of confusion, but after awhile, she confirmed that I was ordering one w/ walnuts & no powdered sugar.  I paid the $32 plus change on my card & dropped a few dollar bills in the tip jar-- order @ the counter & food arrives @ the table.  I noticed that my receipt stated "Nutella French toast," but didn't speak up since many other restaurants have used the same key for diff. items that have the same price.  In this case I should've, bec. Nutella French toast, w/ walnuts on top, was what arrived, but I'm getting ahead of myself, so let's backtrack a bit.  Soon after I paid & received my d'lish hot mocha, Matt brought out the pastries (pain au raisin, pain au chocolat, & an almond croissant) AND an eclair!  Matt revealed that the eclair was not going to have its chocolate coat, since the icing contains corn syrup, so I kindly asked if he could make a ganache, and he kindly obliged.  Well, I think from the photos I took, you can see that everything was wonderful!  The crackles of buttery layers of flaky crust were mesmerizing w/ each bite, & the flavors of both the bread & fillings were utter perfection- delightfully buttery, yet not too greasy nor too salty, & the fillings sweetened just right.  I could see vanilla bean flecks in both the cream filling of the pain au raisin, & in the light, yet flavorful pastry cream that nestled inside the eclair.  The fresh chocolate ganache added just enough decadence-- ooh la la!   Mom couldn't make it to breakfast, but the eclair that I brought home for her to try didn't last 20 minutes!  The tasty Eggs & Sausage crepe was a bit of a letdown, as I found it on the dry side (made w/ turkey sausage) & some of the potato chunks I had eaten were still a little raw.  The layers of crepe was substantial, as I'm used to smaller crepes.  This won't keep me from trying Delice's other savory crepes, but since I tend towards sweeter breakfasts, it may be awhile till you read an update.  The Nutella French toast, made from croissants, as do all their other French toasts, was good.  I prefer a heavier hand with Nutella, as well as added fruit, but I think most people would like it as is.  As tasty as it was, it's not Bananas Foster, so I let Matt know this when he had come around to ask how everything was.  He assured that the correct French toast was on its way, although it will be awhile.  No rush...  I sampled a lot of food yesterday, so I had to ask for boxes for my treats.  I was eager to photograph & taste the Bananas Foster, but it came boxed & ready to go.  I managed to take a pic before trying a few bites...  I think all French toasts should be made w/ croissants, but that's just my opinion.  I'll be ordering this again very soon!  Thank you, Delice & staff, for the patience & hospitality you've shown me!  You may expect to see Mom & me soon (& an email with my pastries order in your FB inbox)!

Finally was able to try The Normal this past Thursday, after friend Chef Jeff K. had suggested I try it when he told me that his restaurant would be closed the weekend after Christmas.  He admitted he hadn't had a chance to go himself, but that he'd heard good buzz about it.    I swung by after my massage ended, sometime around 2p, and I was the only person there, which was great, as that allowed me to ask server Evelyn about menu ingredients of a few items that interested me and to roam freely and take photos while I waited for the food to arrive.  Everywhere I looked was a feast for the eyes!  I saw a framed signage of the diner with a country background set against honeycomb-style wallpaper; gorgeous stained-glass Tiffany-esque ceiling lights twinkling above me; one hundred ninety-four eight-track tapes lined up on a wall, and then I noticed that at the end of this wall, outside the diner, there's a stonewall cap; graffitied lithographs, or perhaps originals, and a mural on two other walls; concave tiles aligning the halls leading to the restrooms AND part of the restaurant ceiling; columns made of gold glass tiles; color-block booth seating and dark green velvet chairs with wood tables; a long glass-topped table for communal seating, or perhaps a large party reservation; and beautiful parquet flooring.  My brain was inundated by all these stimuli-- I was having so much fun, and I hadn't even tried the food yet!  After Evelyn had retrieved all the answers from the kitchen I needed, I was able to narrow my choices for my first visit to Chicken n Waffles to start, and the Sundae Funday and a Haitian single-origin coffee to cap. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-normal-tempe?select=BRTGzTAtr4UA_rj281QEGg#BRTGzTAtr4UA_rj281QEGg  The waffles are probably one of the better-tasting red velvet waffles I've tried (maybe the second-best), but the textures on the inside left me confused in the beginning (semi-crunchy exterior and gummy interior) until I decided that I wasn't enjoying them.  The chicken, on the other hand, was very good-- great breading/batter (no corn products!), and had a spicy pepper seasoning flavor.  I asked if it was Tabasco I tasted, but was told it was an overnight marinade made with Frank's Red Hot sauce.  This dish is worth ordering alone just for the chicken!  There is the option to sub malted waffles for the red velvet.  After discussing the waffle textures with Evelyn and hearing that others had voiced the same concerns and Evelyn saying that the batter did yield differing textures compared to malt waffles, after further bites, it dawned on me that maybe the red waffles were undercooked, so I took a photo. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-normal-tempe?select=O5-wc9LkJRySsdHLPqWxhQ#O5-wc9LkJRySsdHLPqWxhQ  I had no intention of complaining about the waffles and only showed the photo to Manager Maria during conversation when she came around, but she graciously offered to have the kitchen cook another serving for me to take home AND had this item omitted from my bill!  What amazing response, and totally unexpected!    After finishing one of the three pieces of chicken, I pushed the plate aside and had Evelyn put in the order for the Sundae Funday. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-normal-tempe?select=7SG8gtCI1TEn_yH8wm4FRg#7SG8gtCI1TEn_yH8wm4FRg  Made with Grateful Spoon's Salted Caramel ice cream, caramel sauce and brownie bites made in-house, strawberry boba (ooh, these were fun!), and topped with a streusel (honeycomb, or caramel?), this dessert definitely lived up to its name!  Sweet and salty, with creamy ice cream and caramel sauce against dense brownies bites filled with chocolate chunks (these bites could've been chopped into smaller pieces), and then to discover that these boba balls are not the traditional kind you find in Asian milk teas and desserts.  No, no.  These boba balls POP and release strawberry liquid! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-normal-tempe?select=W2pbMX92hZ5v89Z5rD42Gg#W2pbMX92hZ5v89Z5rD42Gg  Oh, my!  With all these different textures and flavors intermingling in my mouth, this sweet treat really made for a fun-tastical experience!    With such great ambience, a very promising menu, and personable staff working there (I also met Chef Brian, who knows Chef Jeff K), I will be returning to try other items on the menu.  In fact, I'm meeting a cousin and her boyfriend there today!  p.s.  Tapacubo, a restaurant next door serving Mexican/Latin-influenced foods, such as arepas, tacos, burritos, and other goodies, just opened the same day as my visit.  I asked Chef Brian if I, with corn and other food allergies, would be able to find something on the menu to enjoy, he said definitely.  I think it's terrific that more and more chefs and their staffs are willing to cater to ever-increasing populations of people who have allergies, and that is why I am very happy to support restaurants, such as The Normal (and soon Tapacubo), that do.

12/23/15  3.5 stars!   It was very busy at Rise Up Bakery this morning!  I arrived sometime between 9 and 10 am, and as expected, RUB was humming.  Not with customers (I was the only one there), but with one cashier, who was busy bagging pick-up orders and icing cinnamon rolls as they finished cooling off on the baker's racks, and three bakers, including an apprentice, flouring the table (or scraping them clean) in preparation to knead more dough for foccacia,  baguettes, bread loaves, cake breads, cinnamon rolls, babkas, cookies, and bars- oh, my!  I assumed that people would be in and out to pick up their holiday orders, and sure enough, many did show up to pick up tomato and pesto focaccia, pumpkin and chocolate chip breads, and sour dough breads, among other items.  I came in to buy Peach & blueberry loaf, and I left with TWO said loaves (can't remember how much each), a French baguette ($3), a pumpkin and chocolate chip bread ($6), two sliced breads (honey wheat and white, with the white fresh-sliced right before bagging!), an oatmeal-raisin cookie ($1.50, or $1.75?), and two scones (a raspberry and a blueberry; $2 each, I think).  The scones were surprisingly NOT dry, were sweet and buttery (and did not need extra butter or curd spreads to enjoy), and despite having a powdery, crumbly texture, was not off-putting, like most dry scones I've tried in the past.  If I were to try to improve** on these scones, I would ADD more FRUIT, but that's just me being too mindful of all the butter that I know goes into scone recipes!  I figure if there's more fruit in the batter, then that must mean there's less butter in the recipe!  Hehe!  I know- silly me!  It was nice to see that even though the bakers were busy baking, and the cashier (a second arrived 20 minutes, or so after I arrived) was busy filling catering orders while making sure the store was amply-stocked for walk-ins, that said cashier was not too busy to make customers feel not-rushed in their selections.  We guests AND cashier traded stories on favorite local haunts, favorite bakery items, and one customer even described how she presented the tomato-pesto bread to her house guests- hot tomato soup and said bread for dinner, and everyone taking a loaf home after as a gift from their host!  The cashier then added that she liked to warm the pesto bread and then add tuna on top.  Rise Up Bakery supplies four bread loaves to Whole Foods (white, wheat, cinnamon-apple, and the fourth may be dill-rye?), which sell at $7 each.  Buy them here, as well as other selections, at just $4.50 a loaf!  Don't forget to use the loyalty cards for sliced loaf purchases-- buy ten SLICED loaves and get the next one free!  I asked if RUB supplies local restaurants with their breads and was told yes, but I could not clearly hear the name she mentioned.  I will edit this review once I find out for sure!  Merry Christmas Eve, everyone!  **Dear Rise Up Bakery... Please, pretty please, offer organic selections!

My first visit, and my last. Groupon brought me here, with a $45 deal for a no chip manicure and pedicure (originally $56).  I thought I was getting the same nail tech (Lynn) for both services- she even asked me what colors I'd like for both services, but when she was almost done with my pedicure, which she later added an extra $7 charge for callus removal (without notifying me of the extra fee, and therefore not giving me a choice), she then informed me that she had another client to take care of, and someone else will be doing my manicure.  When I spoke to the second tech (Taylor), I showed her a photo of a previous color palette I had done, complete with the gel color names, so I thought that the ombre would be done with a glittery gel polish.  Nope.  When I saw her grab the glitter powder from a drawer and place it on the table, I was hoping that she personally wanted to use powder and not glitter gels and perhaps (perhaps!) would not charge me.  Again, no notification of extra fees and therefore no options given to me.  When the time came for me to pay, I already expected a possible charge for the powder glitter, but I was surprised with the extra fee for callus removal.  Both added fees amounted to an extra $17 on top of what I'd already paid before visiting Classy Nails.  The Groupon deal didn't turn out to be such a deal after all!  Oh, and both services took slightly over two hours to complete (40 minutes for the pedi and 90 minutes, or more for the gel mani).  With so many nail salons for consumers to choose from, one would think that a new salon (CN is a year old) would aim to nurture repeat customers.  I am not returning, ever!  ---- UPDATE:   3/20/16  It's been nine days since I had my gel manicure and regular pedicure done at CN, and while the pedicure still looks nice (I may go for six weeks after a good pedicure anywhere), my nails look like what it normally would look like after I've gone two to two and a half weeks after getting a great gel mani from Sophea/Sophia at Scottsdale Nails II!  They're so bad, I'm actually considering booking an appointment at SNII tomorrow!  To think that had this been a normal walk-in, I'd have paid $73 and then find myself nine days later in need of another $30 (plus tip!) gel mani.  I know where I'd rather spend my money and time-- anywhere but here!

I was attracted to the Cinnamon Crumb and Coconut Crumb donuts, but they were covered with the standard powdered sugar glaze and then rolled in their respective crumb toppings.  The only two options I had were the unappetizing cake donut and the buttermilk "donut," which looked more like a deep-fried scone.  Both didn't look tasty at all, but I decided I'd try the buttermilk option.  Took one bite in the car and spat it out!  (I thankfully had an empty coffee cup to use.)  Good thing the "donut" only cost me 94 cents, including tax.  I could've invested that dollar on another cookie from Rise Up- drats!  Service was friendly and helpful, and the store was bright and clean inside.    In a group and want to have a taste of something sweet?  Better to just share a dessert at Zappone's, which is across the road within the same shopping center.  The mascarpone cheesecake with blueberry topping is SUPERB!

3.5 stars!  My first visit after bookmarking this forever and a day ago!  I'd rate my visit at least 3.75 and even 4 stars, since the two people inside let me come in to cool off while still setting up shop for the 10:30 am opening.  I used the time to study the menu, while the man brought chair cushions outside and uprighted chairs and tables, and then return to set up those indoors.  I'd say that their timing is good if they were opening at 11 am, which is their opening time every other day of the week except Sunday...  Laurence, the lovely woman who took my orders and helped the man (sorry, did not get his name this visit) prepare my brunch, was friendly and amenable, and even prepared a second espresso for me, when the second cup of caffeine I'd ordered, an Americano, ended up smelling and tasting very strongly of perfume (hers, I presumed).  Perhaps her wrist/fingers had brushed both cups, because even the second espresso ($1.95) tasted slightly of perfume (though a HUGE improvement over the Americano serving!).  I don't think she understood my complaint, but a replacement was made, and I was happy.  FYI, PR uses a tiny espresso machine, and the menu lists four different choices (I remember a French roast and a Brazilian- I chose the latter).    I already knew, from a couple of previous calls made, that PR sells almond croissants, https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/paris-rendez-vous-phoenix-2?select=hFe1mnplzsh-a2jLdQXDaQ so I knew I'd try a couple.  (The delicious pics on Yelp showed them to be free of powdered sugar- yes!)  If you're sensitive to cornstarch, like I am, you may ask that the powdered sugar be left off, as it is dusted on before serving.  These were amazingly flaky, with caramelized sugar topping, and generous (but not too much), sweet and buttery filling.  I also try pains au chocolat and raisin wherever I find them, so I ordered one of each, as well. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/paris-rendez-vous-phoenix-2?select=wBGy_IvUJeh1iviwFw_aoA  They were good, but I found the chocolate a tad too sweet- but not so sweet that I wouldn't order it again; The raisin was very good!  Love the flaky twists of pastry!  Was that a photo of caneles I saw on Yelp?  Need to try one of those, too, and look!  I may try them as part of a $12.90 combo that gives you:   1. An espresso ($1.95) 2. A lunch entree ($7.50; choice of ham & cheese croissant, Ficelle Picarde- listed on their menu book as a "crepe," and Croque Monsieur) 2b. All lunches come with a side of mixed greens and choice of dressing) 3. Two choices from the following: canele (orig. $2.50), financier (out of stock), and a French chocolate** (~$2.33 per, if bought in a bag of 6).  I went with the canele and a Rocher (praline and hazelnut filling, topped with chopped hazelnuts, and then enrobed in milk chocolate).  I wanted to bring the latter home for Mom, but did pinch off a tiny piece and found it too sweet for my liking, but then again, I'm a dark chocolate fan...  The ham & cheese croissant was good, but the white sauce made the croissant soggy, and I like my croissants flaky. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/paris-rendez-vous-phoenix-2?select=lBac3rWhi81YDJJT1oGQpQ  The salad had a few browned leaves included, but the grape tomatoes were fresh, firm, and vibrant in color.  The canele (only the second piece I've experienced in my life) was a bit disappointing, and perhaps the first one I tried years ago, made from a recipe that the chef admitted to be experimenting with, wasn't a Canele De Bordeaux, but I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first.  It was a beauty to behold, though. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/paris-rendez-vous-phoenix-2?select=0wWCNqsf1M8sCkPam3yDmQ  I almost ordered an affogato (espresso poured over gelato), but decided to wait till the next visit.  Did try a sample of the cappuccino and the stracciatella and marveled at how similar in sweetness and stickiness these were to that of Mesa's Dolce Vita's gelato I'd experienced at Chandler's Peixoto, and then I noticed a printout plastered on the display case stating that these gelato flavors WERE from DV!  Thanks to Laurence and her co-employee (perhaps one of the owners?) and to Groupon for providing me with a lovely brunch this morning!  I'm looking forward to my next visit!  **Originally considered ordering a six-piece bag of chocolates for $14 (a comely gift box costs an extra $1.70), but I'm glad I didn't.  Not because I didn't like the Rocher, but because the 108 degree heat made the beautiful ball melt!  Thank goodness I decided to wait.  I'll be sure to bring a cooler to help keep those beautiful Master French chocolatier Jean Michel Carre pieces of art from melting!

Fantastic coffee shop located in the heart of historic downtown Chandler!  I am so happy that I finally visited!  The shop itself is small, yet quaint, with a great combination of wood, metal, stone slab, and fabric furnishings that adds textural beauty and fulfills sensory stimulation for the senses of sight, touch, and hearing.  The coffee and snack selections stimulate the senses of smell, taste, and again, sight and touch!  The staff I've met (Lisa, Spencer ,and Kim Hak) were friendly, ebullient even, helpful, and knowledgeable in their services and the products they provide.  Do you know that the owners of PC own the coffee farms that provide this shop's tasty beans?  Or that the shop roasts the beans in-house?  Go try their coffee selections and you'll want to take home beans to make your own coffee when you cannot visit the coffee shop-- 16 oz. sell for around $15.95, plus tax.**  You may even have the barista grind them to your coffee machine's specificity, but it's best to keep them in whole bean form until right before you make your coffee to keep them at their freshest!  On my first visit (Sept. 9), I ordered a cappuccino http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/peixoto-coffee-chandler?select=3GSkoxXw4vuwCBjWBC-CpQ and a 16 oz. mocha, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/peixoto-coffee-chandler?select=gdDlEH30J8AYB7ojQSm8mg along with a churro cake http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/peixoto-coffee-chandler?select=tt_NgqTgjSmqIvm1uiYTbw and chocolate chip cookie, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/peixoto-coffee-chandler?select=ifRw954AgvXO1ejAUFW2TQ both warmed at my request!  All were delightful!  The first attempt at swan coffee art was at the suggestion of the barista, and the second attempt was at my request, so that he may get more practice (attempt at redemption?).  So what if the swans were aesthetically imperfect?  The cappuccino and mocha still tasted and felt wonderful, and the vibrations I felt from the staff and the shop's space were very positive, and that's all that matters to me!    On my second visit (Oct. 7), I ordered my first affogato (gelato and a shot of espresso) in a public space (I've made them at home with very strong coffee and organic ice cream), known here as Afogado http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/peixoto-coffee-chandler?select=q6gOD0G4SXmOEe6sUP9VPA and a cortado. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/peixoto-coffee-chandler?select=10Hid2m7mNvXbXYJJnxrdg  Both selections contained double shots of espresso-- oh, boy!  The shop was out of churro cake, and I wasn't hungry for a cookie (I actually just finished dining at nearby Vintage 95), which is also why I ordered the Afogado.  Thanks to Kim Hak for helping cement my decision to try this delectable dessert!  I am so glad to have held out on trying this elsewhere!  ;)  I really appreciate that the gelato is locally-sourced!  Mesa's Dolce Vita supplies the vanilla bean gelato.  Individually, I would not enjoy the bitterness of double-shots of espresso, nor the overly-sweet flavor and sticky texture of the gelato, but their combination was perfection!  And to find, once in awhile, mini-spoonfuls of frosty espresso and gelato made my tastebuds rejoice in ecstasy! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/peixoto-coffee-chandler?select=NY1KJFB4IYeamcDaKqS0iA  The cortado came unsweetened, which is not how I've tried them elsewhere, and I appreciated this.  Very smooth, and satisfying by itself, or with something sweet.  I think I had consumed at least two and a half shots when i decided my system couldn't take anymore caffeine-- I was literally buzzing (hands were shaking!), and this visit came after a massage and happy hour (food, no alcohol).    I am looking forward to more visits with sensual e bonita Peixoto Coffee!  p.s.  A few of the photos I took very near Peixoto.  Such a texturally-rich area of downtown Chandler!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/peixoto-coffee-chandler?select=JM2SXb39afEIdPEC9JXa9Q http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/peixoto-coffee-chandler?select=zkzf_zqOISijrT-owPTUzA  **I took home a bag of Brasil Peixoto Microlot whole beans, roasted on Oct. 1st.  Cupping notes include "rich, well-rounded body, with cacao, caramel, and red berry notes."  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/peixoto-coffee-chandler?select=mcDk1D85eNwiVUWvsGFEDg  ***"Afogado" is Portuguese meaning "drowned."

Met three friends here for VIP lunch (everything except alcohol was comped).  Service was OK (a little hiccup when server told us there was a limit of only ONE app, ONE entree, and ONE dessert & went to ask his manager when we asked him to confirm), but he came back apologizing about his mistake & told us we could order what we wanted, excluding alcohol.  Which brings me to bring up something that I thought was common sense-- if a place comps you something, then please make sure you tip your server!  If a place comps you EVERYTHING you've ordered (sodas, $10 apps, $15 salads and $13+ entrees; filet mignon was $29, AND $5+ desserts), then PLEASE tip 20%!  My four-item meal came to $56 before taxes, so I tipped our server $13 for my portion... The best part of this FREE multi-course lunch was that the food was very good!!  Well, what I had ordered anyway.  Bacon-Wrapped Dates- stuffed  w/ gorgonzola-cream cheese filling and wrapped in bacon.  There were chopped almonds inside, which added another layer of texture to the luscious chewy, yet creamy date and sweet and tangy gorgonzola cream cheese!  The salty-sweet combo was truly delectable & was the runaway winner of all the apps we ordered!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=1biMeepfC8QkBNV_einnWA#1biMeepfC8QkBNV_einnWA  Spicy mac 'n cheese- macaroni pasta w/ spicy Italian sausage, four cheeses (jack, cheddar, Swiss, parmesan), chipotle cream, red bell pepper, & scallions.  First few bites were dry and not tender enough, & we all wrote that off as a loss, until someone dug into the center and found the sweet spot!  SO, if you order this app, be sure to stir it well to distribute the cheesy-melted-goodness all throughout the bowl! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=Iuvrpz6K8-_uQi1oF16gpQ#Iuvrpz6K8-_uQi1oF16gpQ  Filet Mignon- wrapped in peppered bacon & then grilled w/ roasted garlic herb butter.  The steak was placed on a bed of delicious cheddar mashed potatoes & garnished w/ five grilled asparagus.  Cooked medium & was PERFECT!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=_opL4TOUoywHlkkL7t1KrQ#_opL4TOUoywHlkkL7t1KrQ  I would pay $29 & order this entree again!  Here's another look... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=G9AJNu9Sjq7YiTwQRzfo_A#G9AJNu9Sjq7YiTwQRzfo_A  ... and for dessert?  Creme brûlée!  Perfect crisped sugar topping and luscious creamy custard underneath.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=XD4Kd5hmVoX259bCPfUeSA#XD4Kd5hmVoX259bCPfUeSA  Friends ordered the following...  Charcuterie- came w/ four meats, one pate, a fig jam, ONE blue cheese (funny that there was only one cheese featured), crostini, cornichons, & a grainy mustard.  I only enjoyed the crostini, jam, & cheese.  Didn't care for the pate, nor the Italian sausage... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=mZuFr6QkCLZnv5j_4_Eucg#mZuFr6QkCLZnv5j_4_Eucg  Traditional Scotch Eggs- My first time trying these, & I enjoyed the textures!  Crispy-fried battered "shell" and perfectly-cooked hard-boiled eggs that were wrapped with thin-sliced pork.  Interesting & delicious, but I'd rather have a few more of those bacon-wrapped dates!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=vz6suZx9sUkNKZ_ZoMtB0A#vz6suZx9sUkNKZ_ZoMtB0A  Sauteed Brussels Sprouts- simple, & provided a great helping of veggies!  Loved the bacon bits!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=YFCbxkbrdxdFoZOgQMiwvQ#YFCbxkbrdxdFoZOgQMiwvQ  Kung Pao Chicken- a specialty entree I couldn't try, due to the sauce & peanuts.  Heard it was too salty.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=FpOCMHCiEqFaR_lDmqKARg#FpOCMHCiEqFaR_lDmqKARg  Sonoran Chicken Enchilada Stack- Don't know if friend enjoyed, and I didn't try it due to the corn tortillas.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=1mb-us3u7IlrEkbtOmcrtQ#1mb-us3u7IlrEkbtOmcrtQ  Seared Ahi Salad entree- Heard this was good.  Tuna looked perfectly-seared.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=EnfMJtzTOgEJmF_hOmE9-w#EnfMJtzTOgEJmF_hOmE9-w  Hot Fudge Sundae- Friend said brownie was very dry.  The presentation wasn't appealing to me at all.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=_XnNu59MjvNC3BWZzDmadQ#_XnNu59MjvNC3BWZzDmadQ  Blackberry Crumble, with Orange-Shortbread Crust- Couldn't try due to oranges & corn syrup in ice cream.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=PoZbozQL7tO8-GvoVIDMog#PoZbozQL7tO8-GvoVIDMog  Thank you for the free food and fun, Thirsty Lion staff!

AA Ozzy Bakery used to be called AA WHOLESOME BAKERY.  Its Yelp page states it has moved, but the shop is where it's always been at- at least it's at the same location it was when I first reviewed it on August 2011...  I couldn't update my review on that old business page, and so I posted this under Mekong Plaza's business page.  I stumbled onto the loyalty card that I picked up on my last visit here, so this is this review's final resting place, I hope! ---  Some of the pastries I've tried over the years at this bakery's location were good--  about a month ago, I tried a purple ball of taro/yam goodness that is called Spiral Mooncake**.  Overheard a Filipina customer exclaim she's only seen them in China and was coming back later in the day to buy some, so I tried one, and it was d'lish!  However, I just googled the recipe to find that it calls for powdered sugar (corn allergy), so I won't be getting them again.  So sad...  I also like the taro-coconut twisted bun (packaged in loose clear bags), but knowing that the moon cake (also in clear bags, but with glue strips on them) has powdered sugar and my accidentally buying two cakes (mung bean and taro) only to find that the machine-sealed bags they came in had nutritional info on the back that included powdered sugar, I'm hesitant to buy anything from A  againAA Ozzy Bakery again.  At least my waist and wallet are happy!  I've also tried a few "Hone Doe cakes" from AOB's stand  next to the plaza's main doors, and after the second visit, I won't go back due to the flies hovering near and ON the fillings' lids (the one with vanilla custard had flies crawling on them, and either the cook was too busy to swat them away, or she's used to them (a la street-style stand cooking!) buzzing about.  I didn't know the stand belonged to AOB until I spotted a few in bags on one of the store's counters.  If you weren't repelled by my account of seeing flies on the lids, then know that these sell for $0.75 each, or 7 for $5.  (That's a whopping $0.25 discount, y'all!)  Fillings are red mung bean, vanilla custard, coconut and raisins, and honey.  The cook is constantly cooking them on a rotating "grill" that reminds me of takoyaki burners, but with slightly-larger "cups," so you may either buy them already pre-made and sitting in a table-top display case, or get them made-to-order.  If you go for the latter, be ready to wait at least ten minutes, or so for them to cook.    I started out writing this review with three stars, but after all the powdered sugar and Hone Doe cake fails, I had to downgrade to a two.  (I feel giving AOB a one-star review is a bit harsh...)  Might be a good idea to move the cake grill away from the main doors to avoid attracting outdoor flies, but then again, maybe the fillings are just too tempting and will eventually attract flies that are inside the plaza, anyway... I'll make it easy on myself and avoid the flies and the powdered-sugared pastry products and stay away from this bakeshop altogether.  Otherwise, there are some tasty sweets to be had here... Check out the yogurt-filled pastry, which the shop is sampling out lately-- it's good, with a nice crispy/flaky exterior, yet pillowy interior.  The filling is sweet, yet tart.

4.5 stars!  When a previous doctor of mine said she was going to stop recommending weekly massages in the following year "because [she] didn't believe in them," I decided I'd find a doctor that did.  I've been a patient of Dr. Madonna Mallari, one of the internists here, since 2013.  I've also seen two other internists when she wasn't available, and Drs. Atienza and Wong were just as warm, friendly, efficient, and accessible as she is.  The reception staff are also nice and upbeat.    My first visit with Dr. Mallari was for a wellness/physical, a yearly check-up I always find stressful for it includes a Pap test, and I knew that Mallari was going to be my new doctor when the Pap test ended just a few seconds after it began and, more importantly, was PAINLESS!  This annual procedure always seemed to last for longer than ten minutes and necessitated the use of super-cold metal instruments that caused much anxiety and pain, but with Mallari, I barely felt a pinch!  I actually said "That's it?"  I went home and told Mom I found a doctor for us, so she promptly made an appointment to see her, too.  After that initial appointment, I found it hard to schedule the next few visits with Mallari (either she was on vacation, or working at another location) and I've had to settle for Urgent Care when I came down with colds and sinus infections and an appointment with Dr. Atienza, who did my second physical and proposed booster shots (flu and tetanus-- don't believe when you're told you will be sore for only a few days... I was sore for almost three weeks!).  Atienza also informed me that if my past Pap tests have been normal, then I won't have to take it every year- whew!  Dr. Wong was the doctor that removed the staples on my head that I acquired after a fainting spell that left me with a 1.5 inch parietal gash, which an emergency doctor at the Shea Hospital next door stapled shut ten days before.  Wong was affable and easy-going, as if we've known each other for a long time.  When I tried to schedule an appointment to see Mallari, but couldn't get an earlier date and time, I tried to ask for Wong, or even Atienza, but was told that if Mallari was scheduled to work at the Shea clinic, then I will have to wait for an appointment with her.  For that, I'd only rate 3.5 stars out of five.  The other star is for the in-house lab for blood work and other lab tests, which I always have to get done, thanks to my fainting spells, viitamin D deficiency, and other traits I have been blessed with.  No more trekking to other labs, often far from home, with orders in hand.  Just show up a little earlier before your doctor's appointment, or hang out after and get them done here.  The phlebotomists are efficient and skilled at what they do, and if one isn't sure he, or she will be able to get it right the first time (my veins can get very shy, especially when it's chilly outdoors, or indoors, and it almost always is chilly inside clinics), then the initial phlebotomist will ask the other one to step in, which is what happened this morning.  Kudos to the woman who studied both of my arms for the better vein, instead of puncturing me at both arms and feet, without success, like those phlebotomy students did at the Mayo Clinic a few years ago!    I hope that I'm able to find a home nearby to move into, so I won't have to search for another medical group!

3.5 stars.  I've tried Zak's chocolates in a couple of coffee offerings at Peixoto Coffee in downtown Chandler (just yesterday, I tried the Mocha w/ Zak's chocolate, instead of the usual chocolate from Chocolade van Brugge), so I thought I'd visit the actual shop today.  Checking out Zak's location w/ Yelp's GPS yesterday afternoon, I was surprised to find that Zak's is very close to where I live!  While chatting with Jim, the husband in the husband/wife team that owns Zak's, I wondered out loud how surprised I was to learn of the store's proximity to where I live and why I haven't visited sooner, and he told me that Zak's has only been in business for nine months, which could be why.  I mentioned that I'd first tried their chocolates at Peixoto's around three months ago, and wouldn't you know it-- Zak's and Peixoto's partnership is three months' old!  Another interesting fact (well, to me, anyway) is that Zak's Shea location was The Herb Box's original location, Jim told me, about ten years ago.  The topic of THB came up when Jim mentioned that Zak's chocolates are also sold in downtown Scottsdale at Super Chunk Sweets & Treats on Stetson and 6th.  I said I am familiar with the area, as I like The Herb Box and Cartel Coffee there.  I noticed from flyers at the shop that Zak's is one of twelve food vendors at tomorrow's sold out Chocolate & Wine Experience at the fabulous Musical Instrument Museum. [1]  If it weren't for the fact that I work on Fridays, I would be at this festival!    I originally planned to just look around the shop and possibly sample the chocolate buttons on hand with a cup of Starbucks coffee I'd brought with me since Zak's only offers hot chocolate beverages right now (there is a plan to offer Peixoto Coffee here in the future!), but as Jim and I chatted about his and his wife's business, and how they strive to offer organic chocolates utilizing organically-sourced cacao beans [2], which are roasted in-house, and processed with milk from Laveen's Danzeisen Dairy, and organic cane sugar, I was hooked! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zaks-chocolate-scottsdale?select=bskulZmSh-AkVUtURUrbtg  Even the marshmallows are made in-house, and not with traditional corn syrup, either!  As I sampled chocolate buttons of the four single-origin chocolate bars sold here, Jim went into the kitchen to check on something.  He returned a few minutes later to tell me that he went to double-check what they used in place of corn syrup in their mallows, and it is agave syrup.  After all of these years, I may finally enjoy s'mores in the very near future!  Thanks to Jim for actually looking up the info even though I didn't ask for specifics-- I was so excited to begin sampling a few of the chocolate buttons- hehe! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zaks-chocolate-scottsdale?select=4U-KpQG0jKoxWYQeLDdvmw  Have I mentioned that Zak's does not use preservatives in their bars and beautiful truffles??  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zaks-chocolate-scottsdale?select=M1SVGcJdKCbB6a2gm0oZjQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zaks-chocolate-scottsdale?select=8KhnlZafKTecc-h2g_eDMA  Zak's offers a $10 one-hour tour of the store and workshop, with many samples of whatever truffles are made on the day of the tour (specific Wednesdays; max of seven people in a group), as well as a $75 three-hour chocolate clinic where chocolate fans learn how to make a few of these lovely truffle creations. [3]  I have a certain Wednesday in the very near future in mind-- anyone up to joining me for a tour, or perhaps participate in the chocolate-making clinic?  PM me and let's discuss the possibilities!  Tip: 10% off discount on your first purchase!  Bought two chocolate bars (the earthy and slightly-smoky Papua New Guinea and earthy cinammon-y Peru) and ten truffles!    http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zaks-chocolate-scottsdale?select=2Pl5PR1gH15s2HLxHoutDA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zaks-chocolate-scottsdale?select=ieemlLdqZbgV74CxsI0-yA  I've only tasted half of the Raspberry-Green Tea truffle, and while it is delicious (loved the snap of the bittersweet dark chocolate casing, the colorful and whimsical design print, and luxurious truffle texture), I was looking forward to more of the green tea flavor.  Raspberry is definitely the dominant flavor profile here, and I admit to being disappointed in finding fingerprints on this truffle, as well as on one or two others.  In the future, I will make sure to inspect each one for smudges, esp. when gifting.  Regular truffles are $2.25 each, and those containing nuts are $2.75 each.  Zak's also bakes and sells mini-brownies!  I think they're $2.25 each, and 3/$6.  Brownie flights are offered in-store, as well.    [1] http://scottsdalefest.org/2016cw/ [2] Three of the four chocolate bar varieties are made with certified-organic chocolate beans, while the fourth is organic, but hasn't received its certification as of yet. [3] There will be sampling!

2.25 stars!  Hash Kitchen, how could you do that to me?  I so enjoyed my Thanksgiving breakfast this morning- Coconut & Almond Encrusted French Toast (regular menu) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=-tDp5pqC4GK8Jcd2V23Thw AND Sweet Potato Pancakes (November specials menu), and a taste of a neighbor's Herb Fried Chicken & Waffle. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=WIpasuMFsjcohJts0NiP0g  My LavAzza cappuccino, topped with a bit of cinnamon, was nice, and service was friendly, helpful, and patient-- thank you, Jessie! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=nhAKp1QchJnn54LKpKFcKw  I placed an order of Chicken & Waffle to-go, which was placed in a styrofoam box and plastic-bagged, unseen by me (some places show me what the food looks like before putting it away), and put into a paper bag underneath my other two boxes of leftover entrees.  I left happy and thankful for finding a cool breakfast spot I could return to again and again, or so I thought.  Coconut & almond encrusted French toast, minus the powdered sugar, $13.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=My9fTOguFl-GmBtYzzUTiA  Delicious!  Loved the texture of the French toast, but I'll be sure to ask for the maple syrup on the side next time, both to control the amount of syrup I'm using, as well as to keep the toast as crisped as possible for later consumption.  Would order this again!  Sweet potato pancakes, with maple-cranberry reduction and minus the powdered sugar, $9.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=mP0A1XXVwiWGEua-h-ZDDQ  Pancake texture was fine, and color was pretty.  Not off-putting to me... Jessie warned me of the color, but I've had SW pancakes before, so I was ready.  Dish was disappointing, and the maple-cranberry reduction was its saving grace, and I almost was not able to try, because, as the photo shows, I was originally given a container of maple syrup reduction.  I pointed this out to Jessie, who quickly retrieved the right sauce.  She also apologized for the mix-up.  I would skip this one, unless next year's version includes actual cubed sweet potatoes in it-- the pancakes need more texture, either from sweet potato, or a fruit compote.  Tasting of Herb Fried Chicken & Waffle... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=WIpasuMFsjcohJts0NiP0g  Delicious!  I'd already had in mind to order one to-go, and I was happy to find it was tasty after having a sample.  (I'd offered the two women to my left a taste of the French toast, which one of them accepted.  It was her friend who gave me this sample to taste.)  Front page of regular menu http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=QxRhMyJEAwpk28C-mlLRFw  Hours later, after returning from a long walk, I began to compose in my mind what I thought was going to be a 3.5- to 4-star review as I started to warm up some dinner- a little bit of Filipino food, nilaga, that Mom made and a little slice of the chicken and waffle, which I was looking forward to, since that tiny teaser my counter neighbor let me have this morning.  I placed the cut of waffle and chicken into the toaster oven for a few minutes, and then plated it.  When I sliced a bit of waffle off, along with what I thought was chicken, I was surprised to find mostly cooked batter and what looked like a pinky-sized portion of chicken- what the hey?!  So, I went into the fridge again to get more chicken and sliced another tiny portion, and then decided to take a picture of what was left... I was left deflated-- the high I had experienced this morning, now reduced to resemble the sad portion of breaded chicken sitting in front of me.  This morning, I left thinking I'd return, but now am not so sure...  Atmosphere of THK is almost the same as its incarnation, Cuttlefish, and THK is under the same ownership.  The beautiful white marble counter and the wood paneling separating the bar/counter and the restroom area, are still there, and the DIY Bloody Mary bar was a nice touch!  (Jars of differing cornichons, pickled veggies, spices, hot sauces, and olives galore, and for those so inclined, there were even jars of wrapped long Slim Jims on each end.)  Jessie provided great service and impressed me with knowing the ingredients of the entrees I had questions about, and at the same time did not hesitate to get confirmation from the kitchen.  I felt respected as a customer- no condescension or other negative vibes from her to keep me from returning.  So why was I sent home with such a mediocre plating of chicken and waffle???  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=Q50wbVHZEOn2Hl6DOOp36A

Just wanted to update my rating of Hash Kitchen.  I received a note from HK's owner, Joey M., who apologized for the mishap concerning my Chicken & Waffle to-go order and offered a complimentary C&W should I return.  My first visit was for Thanksgiving brunch, and I wanted to do an update, so I brought Mom with me for her first visit and my second on 12/10/15.  I wanted to dine at the wide white-marbled bar, but my Mom favors booths... Thank goodness we were lucky enough to get a great server named Candace, because her friendliness and service made up for the small table space we had after all of our entrees arrived!  We ordered two cappuccinos, the Coconut-almond French toast (of course!), http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=aMB8TgvRGkpKakkjY9wfqg the complimentary C&W, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=WPwSYtAYVTfNB-QSv25aoA and an item on the December specials menu- Gingerbread Pancakes! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=qoqgj_MWZJgrGGWqNXaUAg  This came with a dollop of cream cheese frosting and topped with gingerbread cookie crumble.  Loved that the frosting didn't contain powdered sugar in it and wasn't too sweet.  I am all about textures, so I loved the cake-yness of the pancakes and the different-sized crumbles of the cookies, which had a wonderful gingerbread flavor and essence to them.  Slathering on the cream cheese frosting, which I'd say almost had a butter consistency, gave the pancakes a creamy component.  My mouth, nose, and brain were happy!  Mom really enjoyed the French toast, which surprised the both of us, because she doesn't care for coconut!  (Well, that can't be true, because she loves to make "ginataan," a dessert consisting of different tubers, plantains, and rice cake/patties stewed in sweetened coconut milk.  It's more accurate to say she doesn't like coconut aroma in health/beauty products, such as shampoos and lotions.)  Well, she had two French toast halves, as well as a quarter waffle and a third of the two large fried chicken breast patties in our entree.  Mom said there were three!  I might agree-- all I know is that I had at least three times the amount of fried chicken breast that I received on my first visit.  While I thoroughly enjoyed this visit's version of French toast, this was different from the first, which I felt was a little more tender, less caramelized.  I LOVED both versions!    If my future visits are as delightful as these two were, I feel like I could rate this breakfast eatery five stars!  Service is always friendly, and I haven't felt any negative vibes whenever I inquire about certain ingredients in entrees.  I do feel that HK could improve their mochas in their coffee menu by offering a higher-end chocolate product than the standard chocolate syrup (which contains corn syrup).  Mom did enjoy the mocha she had in lieu of the cappuccino that she didn't like, but she's not as picky about ingredients as I am.    I thank the owner Joey M. and GM Linda Rossow, who both came out and met us.  (Well, I asked if the owner was around, since he asked me to look for him the next time I visited.)  They were friendly and warm, and I could tell that they really liked what they have created with THK.  Linda told us about the BBQ place next door, which replaced Notorious Burgers.  Mom and I will have to try the brisket soon!

4.5 stars!  Hurricane, $7 during happy hour: OKRA rum blend [1], passion fruit, and lemon.  The rums were strong, the fruity mix was definitely tart, and the fresh ground nutmeg on top was a nice touch.  I contemplated on ordering another, it was that good (!), but decided I'd like to be able to drive home after. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/okra-cookhouse-and-cocktails-phoenix?select=w6l2Viw7rThMYYMHUP8L_w  Fried Chicken Skins & Honey Hot Sauce, $4 during hh:  Ooh-ee!  Perfectly battered, deep-fried, and drizzled with their honey-habanero sauce.  Delicious!  A definite must-try.  I didn't think it could be improved anymore, but I tried the OKRA hot sauce made in house (a bottle to take home is only $10) that Brennan brought over, and oh, my! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/okra-cookhouse-and-cocktails-phoenix?select=EJfM0XqszVqjV4bLm6ImeQ  Braised Greens & Calabrian Pork Bites, $6: Braised collard greens and onions, and pork belly first braised in a mirepoix, then deep-fried.  Beautiful, piquant greens, vinegary pork, and I loved the meaty crunch, yet melt-in-your-mouth pork belly fat.  I rarely enjoy ingesting fat, but when prepared this way, I will gladly do so. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/okra-cookhouse-and-cocktails-phoenix?select=Kn-XULQ5x800pSyKyQpGpQ  Buttermilk Meatballs: Pork and beef mix, on a bed of polenta, but I had mine substituted with grilled broccolini [2].  Delicious, and definitely homemade.  The tomato sauce was both sweet and tangy, and the char from the broccolini added a smokiness to the entire meal.  Spied huge chunks of pork fat, but didn't mind.  Appreciated the fresh-grated cheese on top.  Had grilled Noble bread added (+$3), but they were too charred for me.  I tried one, but didn't care for it and had asked Brennan to take them away, but he offered to exchange the original four charred pieces with two non-grilled pieces...  https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/okra-cookhouse-and-cocktails-phoenix?select=9yrrppg1ps1dMN3Uee9lhw  Thanks to GM Dan S. and sous chef Curtis for introducing themselves and for showing courtesy, patience, and understanding, as well as to bartender Brennan, who was very pleasant to converse with and was empathetic, as he too grappled with a few food issues of his own.  Also, I needed a bandage after losing the one I had on after washing my hands, so I asked Brennan if there was one that the kitchen could spare.  He kindly went back to look for some, and came back to let me know that someone had used the very last one that afternoon, but that he'd go "next door to ask for a couple."  What great customer service!  [1] Had emailed for allergen info earlier this afternoon and received a reply from GM Dan Scheuring in less than an hour.  (I'm impressed!  Most restaurants take at least a day, or two, and some don't respond at all.  Kudos to OKRA's staff!!)  I had planned on taking advantage of another restaurant's late brunch hours, but because Dan had taken the time to consult with Sous Chef Alex Curtis regarding menu items that included specific allergens I'd asked about AND attached a list of items from all three food menus (snacks, shares, and bigs) "that would be friendly" to me, I decided to drive out to OKRA on this very hot day (high of 118!) and see what culinary delights I would find.    [2] The menus kindly state no substitutions and only omissions will be granted, so I'm very grateful that Dan and sous chef Curtis worked with me to make my first visit positively memorable.    p.s.  OKRA was a little tricky to find, since the signage on 7th St. was small (the letters for OKRA do not take a lot of space), and another signage said "around the back."  It's not behind Mary Coyle's, but in the corner behind the Phoenix Ale Brewery space on 7th and Palo Verde.  Impressive parking lot- much appreciated!

3.5 stars  Perhaps it was because it wasn't busy this early evening (we caught the 5 pm showing of The Martian), but I found the lobby, theater room, and restroom areas clean and orderly.  I'm more appreciative of "old-style" theaters that do not offer wait service in the viewing rooms, as I find everything about "dining at the movies" too disrupting (ordering, tab service, aromas).    Enjoyed tonight's visit to the Harkins at Chandler Fashion Center.  I miss this area-- we used to come here all the time when we lived in Maricopa, Chandler, and Laveen...  While I do enjoy the very short, and almost-painless commutes to and from our work places living in Scottsdale, I do miss the more down-to-earth and less-judge-y areas that surround it.

12/17/15  Wanted to be at the ribbon-cutting at 5:30 pm, but found myself at the theater at around 7.  The theater lobby was packed!  I had thought of buying my ticket online and paying the $1 service fee, but then decided that if I couldn't choose my seats online (like I can on iPic's website), then I'll just take my chances and buy the ticket at the theater.  There are several kiosks available where you may purchase tickets so that you don't have to line up at the registers.  I am not certain that you may punch in your code into these kiosks to claim your ticket passes-- all I know is that theater reps were telling people in line to "get your confirmation codes ready" for presentation at the register lines.  Since there was only one seat available for the 7:20 3D showing of SW (all the way in the front), I asked for the 8:10 showing of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 3D, which only had two, or three seats available, and I chose one in the C aisle, towards the middle.  While one Yelp reviewer lamented that he and his girlfriend were disappointed in learning that this theater doesn't offer "in-theater service," I applaud Harkin's decision to keep distractions down!  I rarely watch movies at Studio Movie Grill now, because of the servers constantly walking in front of me, and I do not want to hear audience members placing their meal orders while I'm trying to watch the movie.  Also, certain food odors can make me feel ill.  In-theater service seemed like a great idea to me in the beginning, but there are too many negatives for me to appreciate it.  I'd rather dine elsewhere and then go to the movies!  I am happy to read here that I'm able to take a glass of wine, or anything else I may enjoy from the bar Verite Lounge, be it coffee from CARTEL [1], or ice cream from LA GRANDE ORANGE [1] into the auditorium!  With all the grand opening commotion (lines for tickets, lines to get photographed with stormtroopers, lines to order at Verite), I had not the time to find this out myself.    There are 14 rooms equipped with lounge chairs that recline.  Yes, ALL of the chairs recline!  Which explains why ticket prices start at $14.  3D tickets are $17.  Dan Harkins, the eldest son of Dwight "Red" Harkins, was there to welcome us at the 8:10 showing.  He said we were the first to sit at these chairs to watch the first showing of Star Wars-- the first half of that sentence I believed, since we probably were the first to watch anything played in auditorium #14, but the second half confused me, since I had passed up on seeing the 7:20 pm showing of SW, but I let it slide.  It was nice to listen to Dan Harkins, who took over the company, which was in "near bankruptcy" in 1974, when his father passed away.  (His father opened College Theatre in 1940, now called Harkins Valley Art, and Camelview 5 in 1973.  All biographical info I'm including here is according to Wikipedia.)  Do you know that there are currently 30 Harkins locations in five states (Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, Arizona, and California)?    Prices are a bit steep [2], but I really enjoyed the two and a half hours I spent lying on that lounge chair, and I was suffering from sinus headaches the whole time!  The front area of the auditorium had a lot of space, but I found aisle C to be a little too close [3].  I'll have to check out the chairs behind and update my opinion on this [4].  I hope to try a cup of coffee and some ice cream on my next trip, as well!  [1] From the mouth of Dan Harkins himself!   [2] Seniors and children may avail of the $6 discount on movies that start before 6 pm. [3] You may choose your seats online at harkins.com!  There's a $1 convenience fee per ticket, but it's worth it.  Otherwise, you may save a little extra cash and take your chances by waiting in line and then choosing your seats at the register. [4] Second visit had Mom & me in seats near right end of aisle F, and we could hear and feel vibrations from, I assumed, the parking garage.  Distracting (lasted throughout the entire film) and a little disconcerting... May have to reserve seats closer to the stage, as I didn't notice these vibes in aisle C.  #800

3.25 stars! [1]  Come for the German Pancake and Avocado Benedict!  I was invited to this morning's private training event by Elmer's Restaurants Online Media Director Kolten Lindsey via email a few weeks ago.  I was allowed to take up to three guests with me, but due to schedule constraints (and a mistake in actual date given and confusion that ensued), I was only able to sync with a cousin, who very much enjoyed today's breakfast jaunt, as did I!  It was very nice to be personally greeted by Kolten and the president of Elmer's Restaurants, Inc., Jerry Scott, who both spoke of the history of the business (25 stand-alone locations, most in the Northwest), as well as to the reasons behind their newest concept, Egg 'N Joe.  This Scottsdale location is the first to open in the U.S., and two more are set to open in Gilbert and Chandler later this year, according to Jerry.  Elmer's private shareholders wanted to be able to offer their company's breakfast and lunch offerings in smaller, intimate spaces that would lend themselves to find homes in shopping centers, rather than launch 7000, or larger, square-foot stand-alones.  My 20-something cousin and I found the cozy space decorated nicely with lovely red plates and mustard-yellow mugs on one wall, and we enjoyed the complimentary meals and non-alcoholic beverages.  I tipped our server "S." 20% of the original ticket price (pre-tax), plus a little extra [1], while I dropped $15 in the donation cashbox to help fund Banner Children's Cardon Children's Medical Center's Music Therapy program, which Egg 'N Joe pledged to match dollar for dollar!  There were ten entrees and a handful of beverages to choose from-- not the actual menu, but a condensed one for today's private event. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/egg-n-joe-scottsdale?select=FwSyyReH3TNgpc1xQPylqw  My cousin ordered a cup of hot chocolate and the Avocado Benedict, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/egg-n-joe-scottsdale?select=IA_EBlGJplpvzq6ZDrUsmA and I ordered a cup of black coffee and the German Pancake Combo, with lemon wedges and minus the powdered sugar. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/egg-n-joe-scottsdale?select=FyPlrotrKvGZri1QDRun9A  This dish also came with choice of two eggs (over-medium) and choice of meat ("S." recommended Daily's smokehouse bacon). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/egg-n-joe-scottsdale?select=wN0QHq96fmWfReH4AxxoCA  After "S." placed our orders, I decided to put in an order of Lingonberry crepes after a discussion I had with Kolten after I had asked him, "Fruit Festival Crepes Combo, or Lingonberry Crepes Combo?"  He immediately suggested the Lingonberry, as he had just had it earlier, and after a few questions with the kitchen manager, we found out that out of all the fruit toppings, the lingonberry sauce, which came with whipped butter mixed in, is the only one that didn't have cornstarch in it (unlike the triple berry, strawberry, and maple-caramel apple). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/egg-n-joe-scottsdale?select=fhwgnbs3A5evBJZBe0Hg6w  So, I asked him if it would be too much to order another entree, and he said no.  :)  I asked him which choice of meat did he recommend, keeping in mind that I already have bacon coming, and he said for me to try one of each link, although his first suggestion was to get the bacon.  In retrospect, I should've stuck with bacon, because the three strips were PERFECTION. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/egg-n-joe-scottsdale?select=ZNpie7Y6gzq6iuZuGCgbkQ  Cousin enjoyed her hot chocolate, as well as the Avocado benedict, which came sans avocado, because "S." had not heard her say it.  We wondered why, since it was the only benedict selection offered on the condensed menu. This was quickly remedied when "S." delivered a saucer with avocado on it.  I enjoyed the German pancake's texture and lemony flavor from the wedges.  Thank goodness Sprout's is next door, because I forgot my personal bottle of maple syrup... [2]  Kolten offered to bring a saucer of extra lingonberry butter for me to use on the pancake-- AWESOME suggestion, Kolten!  Thank you!  The bacon strips, as I already mentioned, were perfect, and while the eggs came over-easy, I still liked them very much, especially compared to the "soft" scrambled eggs which arrived pretty hard.  Ugh.  Cousin thought they were good, though, but I'm picky about scrambled eggs-- Mom prepares the BEST!  I also liked the texture of the crepes, but found them to be too greasy!  I'd soon order the German pancake again and ask for the lingonberry sauce, minus the butter, on the side!  FYI, both links were awful!  Were they rancid?  I wouldn't order them again.   Thank you to Kolten Lindsey for reaching out with the invitation, and to Jerry Scott and Egg 'N Joe staff for having us over.  We will return!  [1] Would've tipped more, but cuz & I noticed "S." started looking very annoyed with us towards the end.  Major turn off!  [2] ENJ offers two syrup options: a corn syrup blend and sugar-free.
