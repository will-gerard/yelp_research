Food is OK. Decent taste. Chicken was weird looking though.

Love this place. Their Southwest Sandwich is awesome. Would have 5 stars if the pricing weren't so steep.

Good food, good service. Though my friend did end up having something harder than usual in her food, mine wasn't bad. Check it out, why not.

Taste was meh. Couldn't finish it it was that bad....Jimmy Johns and Subway win over this place. I regret giving a tip. Couldn't even finish the food. Biggest waste of $12....Good cookies though.

Worst food I've ever had...so bad I spit out the first bite and threw away an ENTIRE sandwich and fries. Meat tasted like plastic. I hope this place gets shut down.

While the theater is nice and their Minute Maid Smoothies are amazing, their food is a disappointment. I ordered chicken strips and ended up getting something that tasted like it was microwaved from McDonalds. C'mon. At least hire some real chefs.

I called in an order today and told them no cheese or creme. When I go to pick it up, there's creme on it. I mention it and they come back 10 minutes later with the renewed order. Come to find out, all they did was wipe off the creme. This is a good way to get sued. If someone says no xyz on their food, it's probably for a good reason, for example an Allergy. Wiping it off doesn't count as NO xyz. Deducting a star for a lazy chef who is a potential health hazard.

Waiter got my order wrong the first time. Had to send it. back. Came back looking like they just dumped half of it. I'm just dreading what they did to my food. Waiting (movie) anyone? Food wasn't great either. Avoid.

Overall, I'd tend to choose Trader Joes over F/E. In most cases the food tastes better. That and F/E sells some of the same stuff as Safeway for more.  F/E is supposed to be a healthy affordable store. Milk isn't healthy (and it's in too many of their products that don't need it -- fail for someone lactose intolerant), and the prices on some of your the meals here are just slightly lower than going to a restaurant for better food.   If they would price match and produced better food without lactose all over the place, I'd give this place a better rating. Otherwise, it's just a place to go if I'm in the area or the rest of the places are closed.

Bland.  Overpriced. Not remotely worth the ten dollars I spent on my pancakes that IHOP does a better job with. Avoid at all costs.  UPDATE: One of the managers (The one with the awesome mustache) comped the meal, and thanked for the feedback. So A+ on service.

I've now been here a couple times and have tried the Chicken Salsa wrap (which is disgusting, and shouldn't even be on the menu for being a boring item) and their Chipotle Cheese steak (which has been amazing at times and horrible at times). The cookies they have however, have been phenomenal each time, though they definitely need to be bigger.  The staff has always been awesome.  All in all, I recommend this place, but there needs to be more consistency in taste.

Typical American restaurant. Flavorless. Not to mention overpriced. Don't waste your money.

When I went, it was still in Queen Creek, but I definitely wasn't impressed. Wasn't the least bit scary. Plus, the pricing was ridiculous, way too overpriced.

Ultimate in Luxury Cinema. The chairs are as comfortable as my bed, the AV system rocks, and the food I had was pretty damn good.   Excellent date night spot.

Another overpriced place where you pay 14 bucks for a small plate with 7 tiny pieces of meat in which most are too fatty to eat. Great customer service. But overpriced with crap food.

Nothing special. Makes me think of Dennys with another name. Should be closed down for being boring and serving crappy bacon.

Alert: Possible Food Poisoning.  While the staff is friendly and the food is actually quite good. I've now had diarrhea twice from this place. While its possible it was the spices, not ruling out uncleanliness given the past reviewers.

While their menu can sound a little ya-ya like, their food is definitely worth trying. Highly recommend the chicken protein plate.

Well, Chop Shop has gone downhill. Their food used to be flavorful. Now the last few times I've eaten there their food has been bland, lacking flavor and doesn't taste as fresh as it used to. Their Protein Bowls don't come with as much sauce (which is the only thing that makes them bearable) and their meats are now subpar. Time to start avoiding this place until they get back up the hill to the quality they used to have.

The food was just OK, with very little meat given, and not very filling. This is just another overpriced place to avoid in Scottsdale.

Okay, so I've now eaten here three times, and have tried two different Sandwiches. I can honestly say that It's generic and bland. Their Cheesesteak needs something to season it, even with hot peppers and onions, its still dull. The Tuna was too fishy tasting, almost like they didn't do anything special with it. Their cookies are dull. This place needs work, I'm not sure how they won best sandwich shop. Avoid this place unless you want to pay too much for food an amateur could make at home.

Food is great! Service is awesome. Loved their burrito and the constant free refills. Pricing is a little steep though. Still, recommended!

So the parking at this location during lunch is a clusterfk. Minus a point for choosing a crappy location on the corner.   They mixed our names on the orders, meaning I got someone else's food.   The burger is thin and just okay, wasn't piping hot either, made me think of McDonald's.   When I called to mention they messed up the order, they don't answer their phones.  In any case, I'll be keeping my business at Five Guys and would not recommend Smashburger.

This has to be one of the best restaurants I've ever been to in Scottsdale. The food has been amazing each time. The portions match the price, and the staff has been amazing each time.

Cheap, fast and reliable rides. As for those of you complaining about surge, it's supply and demand.
