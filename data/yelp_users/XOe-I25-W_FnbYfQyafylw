Pleased with the faster, free wifi here! Hot outside (over 100 degrees), a/c inside!! X-hausted from the weekend  I'm at the airport right now waiting to fly back to SJC! This is a pretty BIG airport! I'm glad the free wifi here is MUCH faster!!! I'm also grateful to be inside the airport and not outside right now. I've had enough heat for the year! :P Security was quick and painless!  FYI: For pick-up there are 3 locations (north, south, and east). So know where you are getting picked up ahead of time! :)

Caliche mud structure Arizona's national monument Sadly didn't quite appreciate the ruins Ahhh it was 102 outside and all I could think of was shade!  I was expecting this "Casa Grande" to be BIGGER!! Admission to get in was $5 and I don't think it was worth the drive and the cost. Though I guess the money goes back to mantaining the ruins, but still it's just a pile of mud!   Advice: + Go earlier in the day, when it's cooler + If you have a national park pass, then I guess you should go visit it + But it's OK to skip this one

Sushi? All you can eat? In Vegas? Sounds soo fishy o.O  I dislike buffets greatly because the quality of the food is usually very low and you force yourself to eat as much as you paid, if not more. Nor do I like the gross/overstuffed/ill/about to explode feeling after. Before coming here I have to confess to you, I didn't like the texture of raw fish or even the thought of eating something raw. O_O  Last January, I attended CES 2012 in Vegas. My friend and I hadn't eaten all day and we decided to head off The Strip for a late, late 3pm lunch. My friend is a crazy sashimi/uni/durian lover and wanted sushi. I remember my co-worker had mentioned about how much she had loved this place. I was a bit skeptical at first. Sushi in Vegas? Really? Sounds fishy to me!  AYCE lunch buffet for under $25? What a steal! The whole time we were there my friend and I only ordered nigiri! haha We really wanted to make sure we got our money's worth! It was to the point our server said, "You know, we offer other items like specialty rolls and side dishes!" :P After each bite of nigiri, my appreciation for raw fish greatly increased. :) All the nigiri we had ordered was very fresh and delicious! It was my first time trying other fishes besides salmon... fishes I hadn't even heard of. Tai? Hamachi? Hotate? Saba? Hirame? Unfortunately, we couldn't order the amaebi (sweet shrimp) or uni (sea urchin) because it wasn't dinner time yet :( Boooo... next time though!  Can you believe we still had room for dessert? Yes, I got 2 scoops of green tea ice cream and a scoop of lychee sorbet. All were excellent! I was a bit embarrassed to order the tempura ice cream since we'd ordered so much nigiri already and our server put our check down at the table, which was probably a sign for us to leave! haha I guess the next time I come back I'll need to order a few tempura ice creams first! :D
