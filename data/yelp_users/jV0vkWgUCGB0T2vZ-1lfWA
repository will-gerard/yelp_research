I was hoping to get a few classes out of the way this summer, and wow... Did I have to work hard- to get INTO the classes that is. This school is by far the most disorganized and unmanaged place in the world. Thanks PVCC!!!!!!

Mark, the store's manager, is truly an asset to the business. He is the only associate I ask for when stopping in, as his knowledge is extensive and he does not ever pressure buyers to buy, as many smoke shop employees tend to do.   Overalls, this is my favorite smoke shop in Tempe. Their glass collection could use some bigger names in the case, but super high-end designer glass truly isn't this shop's market anyway. Besides that, their customer service and great prices will keep me coming back! Until Mark quits, that is... (only kidding!)

REALLY good. If their guacamole was as good as Chipotle's they would be five stars for sure

Super sugary and calorie filled deliciousness

This is truly the most consistently horrible Dunkin Donuts I have ever had the misfortune of forcing myself to visit. Each time I return to this location I question what I was thinking.  An iced coffee with cream and sugar is NOT difficult to produce, Dunkin. Why have I never received a perfect coffee from at least one of my five or more trips to your store? What a true shame.   2 stars because the food tastes alright. For the service and coffee, however, one star.

Fletcher's is meh quality service at decent prices.   For a cheap/quick service to your vehicle, it's worth a trip in if you have a coupon.   If not, go elsewhere.      Also beware of pushy sales tactics, this place survives off of unnecessary upsales.

Brigade is going to mean serious trouble for other barber shops around town... And that's coming from a long time Electric Haven customer.   I used to think Electric Haven was the best barbershop in town, until I saw all of their most talented barbers opened their own place. Seriously one of the best experiences I've had getting my hair cleaned up in a long time.   I have been going to Tim for a year now, so obviously he is my barber of choice. However, I wouldn't be afraid to sit down in any of the other barbers chairs in this shop. Every single one of them is a master!    Plus, it's only $17 for a cut... Can't really beat that. No plastic accepted - bring cash!
