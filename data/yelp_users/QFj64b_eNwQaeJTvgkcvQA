This place is great! Literally it's businesses like these that Yelpers need to know about! Such great stuff at really low prices. Screw IKEA for inexpensive furniture shop here and get great stuff that nobody else will have. I can't even begin to list how many awesome pieces I've gotten from here but one of my favs is an beautiful oriental end table that was $15. Another time I got a vintage sign for $7 that people have begged me to sell to them (can't blame them, it's pretty cool).   Also, the staff is so friendly and nice but not in an annoying paid-on-commission-way- but in a we-love-our-store-and-what-we-sell kind of way. This place is nestled within a few antique stores but Everything Goes is by far the best. It can be overwhelming since there is a lot of stuff but try to focus on one thing at a time. Also, don't be afraid to buy a chair with ugly fabric or a dresser painted and ugly color; use Pinterest to DIY a facelift. I don't even live close but it's always worth the drive.

My sister called me at work in a panic when she found my Puggle and German Shepherd mix grubbing on a weird white rock that smelled sorta like chemical. We called poison control under the assumption that perhaps this was chlorine from the pool who said to take them to the vet immediately; fun stuff. After calling three vets including my own, finally these guys said they weren't too busy to take us. Don't even get me started on how frustrating it is to be told to take your dogs to the vet immediately and not being able to because all the vets are too busy (here's looking at you, Banfield glad my $59 a month is really paying off!) anyway- enough complaining about other vets. The front desk employees were nice and quick.   I really liked Dr North. She was super real with us and didn't try to talk us into unnecessary tests. We brought it a sample of the white rock in question and she took it in the back and tried to determine what it was. She decided since the dogs looked fine and after studying the sample that it probably wasn't chlorine. She also only charged us for one visit even thought it was two dogs with was unbelievably kind.

I love this place! Those who know me know that there's nothing I like more than a tasty breakfast (most important meal of the day, duh!) I like the design and vibe of this place not to mention the food is to die for! I love their breakfast burritos and sweet potato muffins (so good!)   I don't really have anything bad to say about this place. It's one of those (similar to Sauce) where you order in line and then they bring it out to you. Overall, I love this place!

I've come here a few times for lunch during the week and I really like it. It's quick, tasty and inexpensive. I really like that they don't use a lot of salt and most of the food is pretty "lite." The Mongolian beef is probably my favorite but I've had a couple of other things on the menu. The fried rice is a little bland but truthfully I'm glad because then I can skip it and save the calories. I also like that the owners are pretty much always there and are very friendly. If you're in the area and need something quick this is a great little spot.

I hate giving bad reviews but this place is horrible! My parents hated it when I was a kid and I foolishly thought perhaps I'd like it as an adult. WRONG! The server had a thick accent (which don't get me wrong, I'm willing to make an effort) but he had the nerve to get rude and impatient with me when I asked him to repeat himself! He also cut me off mid sentence several times or would simply walk away while I was talking to him. It was ridiculous to the point of being comical! I felt like Larry David on an episode of "Curb Your Enthusiasm!" And to make matters worse the food is disgusting! Picture soggy deep-fried nastiness with dollar store canned ingredients. Gross. I hardly touched my meal and the clueless (or careless more likely) waiter didn't even bother to inquire. My friend and I were laughing and saying "so basically we could have gone to Taco Bell and it would have been cheaper, tastier and friendlier." But seriously, Los Olivos, in the same area, is much better or literally anywhere else in that shopping center!

Just moved into my new house in Tempe and am lucky that this little gem is in my backyard. I've been here twice now and so far I've really enjoyed everything I've had. My favorite so far? The spinach enchiladas are YUM YUM YUMMY!!! I ordered the 3 Amigos Sampler feeling least excited about the spinach enchiladas but they were by far my favorite. Next time I might just order those. Also, they have a skinny margarita! Yay for that!

I've decided to update my review based on the owner responding to my review. I don't take back what I said about it being just okay and sort of the main draw being the cute vintage diner feel but it's clear that this business cares about customer feedback and that says a lot to me...it says they need another star! :)

Love Papago Brewing! Just when you think you can't find a better "chick beer" than the Peach deliciousness at Four Peaks, you try the Orange Blossom from Papago Brewing and the game is forever changed! All the beers that they brew are great. Also, it has a great vibe; it's such an awesome regular bar, you know what I mean? Like the kind of bar where you might actually meet someone that you'd want to date, who knew those still existed? I came here yesterday with a friend and was pleasantly surprised to see a lot of young professionals unwinding and having a good time. They have darts and I think (if my memory serves correctly) they also have shuffleboard in the other room. The food is pretty good too but honestly this place is more about the beer (duh, it's a brewery!) than anything else. It's across the street from SkySong which is nice for people in the office because it doesn't seem like there are too many other places around for after work happy hour. I recommend! It's a cool place and probably great for taking out-of-towners.

I went here recently to transfer the title of my car from my mom's name to mine and to also get the car registered under my name. Man! It was so easy! You don't have to make an appointment you can just walk in. The prices of the services provided are all listed on the wall and literally you're done in a matter of minutes. Definitely a hidden gem worth knowing about.

One of my favorite bars on Mill! Love it because it's not full of douchey frat boys or dirty old creepers hoping to score with a college chick. Like garlic with vampires, the Irish theme seems to keep the bros away. Like anything slightly foreign is too hard for them to understand so they think "screw it, let's go to vintage" or one of those other horrible places. I also like that it's pretty casual. Sometimes a girl doesn't want to wear high heels and a short tight dress sometimes a girl wants to rock jeans and converse and slug down a Black and Tan. Just saying...

I really love this hotel! Here's why:  Local- How rare is it to find a local hotel in your area? Okay well in AZ it's somewhat rare and this one is LOCAL and it's fantastic. Usually those two items don't go together.  Design- I love the retro vibe of the design. It's like stepping back in time but in the best way. It makes me want to wear cat-eye glasses and drink vintage cocktails. I love it!   Bath Products- Yes, I know. How tacky am I that I'm even bringing this up but c'mon; we all secretly judge hotels by the quality of what they have in the bathroom. These Icelandic wonder potions smell amazing! AND the soap is a sphere. Holy shit! Nothing gives me more satisfaction than rolling that around in my hands as I wash them (it's the small things in life, really). Honestly, when I stayed here with a friend for my birthday we literally had the same fond memory "SOAP BALLS!" We recalled, affectionately.   Customer Service- Every employee I've ever talked to is nice and upbeat. I like that, especially being a local that stays here for fun every now and again.   The pool- Is awesome. Both of them (I just remembered there are two; one has a cool fountain and the other I've actually sat by). I love lounging out there and just checking out from life for awhile. Man- I need a staycation!

Ah San Felipe's...I'm surprised by your somewhat horrible star rating. Perhaps most Yelpers don't share the same affinity for you that I do from my ASU days? That's okay, to each his/her own! So okay, is this the best Mexican food in the world? No. But is it one of those places that's totally College fun? Yes! It's always a good time, they have live entertainment and events not to mention their sol-a-rita (Margarita with Sol beer in it) is pretty great...then again I'm a sucker for anywhere that has a beergarita. The service is usually pretty decent and I love that it's in Tempe marketplace so you can get some shopping on before or after. I always have a good time when I come here. This is one of those places that it's not so much about the food and more about the fun. I recommend San Felipe's if you're looking for a good place to hang out and day drink but not if you're looking for fantastic Mexican food. Although, I like their food! But I judge Mexican food based on how much melted cheese it has so take that into consideration! :-)

Aww Patties...so many drunken nights I've shared with you. This place is awesome! I've never had a bad time here. I love that it's very "come as you are" but there's also a dance floor, shuffleboard and pool so you can do whatever you want. Last time I came here, they played the song "Wild Ones" by Flo Rider and it was hysterical to watch drunk people dance and sing along. Just one of several awesome memories I'll always take with me from Patties.

It took me a little while to write this review because I hate the idea of writing something negative but after the horrible last experience I had here if I didn't share this nightmare experience I'd feel guilty for not informing other customers, it's that bad.  In July, my puppy contracted giardia from Doggie Day Camp in this PetSmart. Yes, that's unpleasant but not my main gripe. I mean it's good for pet parents to know but I realize it's also like being mad that your kid got a cold at kindergarten; there's only so much they can control. Nor am I going to go on and on about how my dog not only contracted this illness at this Petsmart, but also the vet (Banfield) that is in this establishment, has not been able to cure it after several treatments and dollars spent. But that's another review entirely...No my biggest issue is what happened on October 4th.  So, because my dog has been blacklisted with giardia, she can no longer attend Doggie Day Camp until she's better. Again, not a big gripe, not even unreasonable on there part. They don't want other dogs to get it; fine. I was planning a trip to Las Vegas to celebrate my sister's 21st birthday and of course a big issue was "What am I gonna do with my giardia-infected dog?" So I walked in to the Pet Hotel and explained my predicament. The two men there were nice and assured me that most-likely it wouldn't be a problem to board her if she's kept away from other dogs. That made sense. The next day, (this is a week in advance mind you) I called to make the reservation. No questions regarding my dog's health (unless you count her shot record, which they verified with my vet who presumably made no mention of the giardia). It wasn't until the woman asked me if I wanted to do Doggie Day Camp that this even came up. Looking back, I should have lied. I told her point blank "I don't think she can do that because she has giardia. But I was told she could be boarded if she's kept away from other dogs. Is that okay?" I don't honestly remember her exact response but it did NOT consist of "Oh, let me check and make sure because I would hate to have her turned away day of your trip." Instead, she booked my dog so I assumed it was fine.   I showed up to board my dog. It was some of the same staff members as when I took my dog for Doggy Day Camp and they were super nice and even said "We were just talking about her! She hasn't been here in awhile." "Yeah, that's cause she's been battling giardia." I confessed for a third time to these people. The girl looked concerned and said. "But she's better now, right?" And I said "No she still has it." Suddenly she had to make an urgent call to make sure it was alright to board her. After fifteen minutes of waiting she got of the phone. The verdict? "I'm sorry, we can't board her."  WHAT!?!?!?! DAY OF MY TRIP YOU TELL ME YOU CAN'T BOARD HER!!! WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH ONLY HOURS UNTIL I LEAVE???? WHEN I MADE THESE ARRANGEMENTS A WEEK IN ADVANCE???  AND I've said every step of the way that she has giardia! I tried to do the right thing! But I guess I should have lied. Clearly that's what the other jerk did to get his/her dog in that ultimately gave it to my dog!!!! It's not like I boarded my dog for the fun of it- I was leaving that DAY! AND you talked to my vet (that's in the same damn building!) to verify her shots! Why on earth didn't it come up then? It was a nightmare. I ended up on the phone with what felt like every pet boarding place in Scottsdale a mere hours before going on my trip. After making probably at least six calls I found a vet that would take her.  AND BY THE WAY!!! This other Vet that I ended up boarding her at ran a giardia while I was in Vegas per my request and it was NEGATIVE...in fact, they speculated that it had been out of her system for MONTHS!!!! MONTHS!!!!   Seriously Petsmart? This is unacceptable. I wish I could give you at least 2 stars for your nice staff and the fact that my dog was happy there but unfortunately no amount of kindness will ever make up for a lack of education and sure she was happy then but the events that followed caused her and I both a great deal of misery.  Spare yourself a similar fate and DO NOT GO HERE! I won't even shop here again!

Wow...Amazing yummy food, fantastic service, cool vibe, awesome decor...this place is pretty legit. I sampled some of everyone's and all of it was damn good. The potato and leak soup is great (which is what I got because yeah...I don't know I'm lame) my sister had the bangers mash which was so deliciously English! The only thing more English was the cottage pie (doesn't that just sound British?) my brother had the carne adovada (sp?) which was good but the table agreed that the super English ones is where it's at so that's my recommendation. AND you must end with the banoffee. That...I mean no words. So great...I mean if I decide that I didn't care if I were morbidly obese I would probably eat one everyday for the rest of my life.

I'm shocked I haven't reviewed these guys before! This is my Go-To place for Indian food. Really delicious!   Pros- Very good food! I was a newbie to Indian food when I first came here (years and years ago) and now I feel super confident in my ability to order it. You can request what level of spiciness you'd like (scale of 1 to 5) which is nice if you're a wuss like I am! They have bellydancers on the weekends (don't make eyecontact or they will ask you to dance with them lol). The servers are usually very attentive (fill up soda's quickly, can answer questions, you know, the usual).   Cons- I guess my biggest gripe would be that they are forever offering a Groupon. The worst part? When I came here last I was with my aunt and she used a Groupon. NOOOOO!!!! I HATE HATE HATE Groupon and Groupon users (sorry Aunt Kris, you are of course exempt because you at least tip on the full amount). I say this with love Tandoori Times as I have been loyal to you since high school, no more Groupon! Honestly it ruins the experience for us loyal full paying customers because suddenly the restaurant is packed with these deal-chasing vultures.

This place is awesome! It used to be my Saturday ritual to bring my laptop and get some writing done (I should start that up again!). Good coffee, comfortable environment that only a local coffee shop can really create plus they are 24 hour. I'll say that again, 24-HOUR!!!! And have a drive thru and a bar! I've never ordered a drink there but tempting! You could quite literally spend the whole day there and might want to.   Also, (because those that read my reviews know how dog obsessed I am) they give treats to dogs! Actually, I think they are even allowed here. I've seen people bring dogs on the patio and even in the coffee shop but as a courtesy I would ask before bringing your dog inside but that's just me...

I'm a big fan of 5th and Wine. It's one of those places that anytime I'm meeting up with someone and they suggest it, I'm always like "Ooh, yeah!" Great selections of wines and very knowledgeable staff...but understated knowledgeable not pretentious. For example, I like wine but I'm far from a connoisseur and when I give cryptic descriptions on the type of wine I want last night's for example: "I want a sweeter wine like a pinot grigio or a Riesling but I want it to be less fruity and sweet and more like...buttery. You know how some wines are sorta buttery?" Ha! Yeah. Most servers would be like...WHAT? But this gal was like "No, no, I totally get what you mean. I think I have the perfect thing but if you don't like it, we can try the other one I'm thinking of." Well that 'other one' wasn't necessary because she knew exactly what I meant and her suggestion was perfect.   Speaking of the server being awesome...she really was fantastic! I arrived at 5:54pm and she quickly came to my table and was like, "Can I grab you a drink while it's still happy hour?" Um...yes please!   Also, their food is delicious! I really like this place overall and everyone that I bring here usually ends up coming back and bringing someone else. It's a good place.

Hands down one of my favorite restaurants! I love everything from the cleverly named and delicious menu items, the tasty selection of cocktails and beers, the hip and glamorous decor that Fox Restaurants are known for and the friendly wait staff. Also, your food tends to come out really quick which when you're ravenous is always good to know. This is the kind of restaurant that I'm never not in the mood for. I recommend ordering the pretzel fondue (a must have really), the Mac Burger (which is their take on the Big Mac) and to wash it down with a Wild Blue beer. A meal that's worthy of your cheat day! Delish!

So I did the unthinkable in the beauty industry: called my usual waxing place for a day of appointment...on a Sunday at 3:00. I know, I know; I'm not a good planner. Needless to say my usual place was nice and sympathetic but couldn't get me in so I decided to roll the dice and give European Wax Center a call. The girl on the phone was super sweet and scheduled me for a 3:30 (wow, right?). She then told me that if I can prove that I'm an instate resident I get 50% making the cost like $25; which is insanely cheap for a Brazilian but even without that discount it's a good price! I usually prepare myself to spend like $60 plus tip. So naturally and based on the reviews and mixed responses of my peers I assumed "welp, it can't be cheap fast and good" so as she was about to rip off the first piece of wax, I braced myself for serious pain but...nothing! I mean really; it didn't hurt. And this is coming from someone that will eat almost anything cold to avoid burning my tongue because I'm such a wuss. Like I've ripped off band aids that caused more pain by far than this. I didn't even grimace. So of course me being the skeptic that I am thought "ha! Well we shall see how many ingrown hairs I develop and how patchy it is!" It's been almost a week and just as smooth and ingrown free as my $60+ one that I usually get. I'm still in sort of a state of disbelief; I feel awkward giving them five stars to be honest (aww poor European Wax Center!) but honestly I don't really have anything bad to say. I can't even go for a cheap shot like the decor because even that was stylish and cute! Or ding them for trying to upsell me too much, I mean they did but it wasn't annoying. Actually, maybe I'll listen to what the membership includes next time rather than brush it off in a trollish groan per usual.   PS I had Michelle; since several people cite that the quality varies depending on who you have.

This is a great little place! I used to go here all the time when I lived up in North Scottsdale for happy hour but I found myself here last night and remembered how much I liked it. I had the pad Thai with beef and it was really good. You can choose your level (scale of 1 to 5) of spiciness which is nice. I'm sort of a wuss when it comes to spicy food. I like it but my palette is a bit sensitive so I went with a 2 and it was just spicy enough to give you that extra kick without having to chug 3 glasses of water...I only needed one! Just kidding; no water needed; it was great! :-)

I love RNR. The bottomless mimosas are always great on a lazy Sunday-Funday. Most of the food I've had there has been really good and the service is pretty quick too. My advice is to arrive early on Sunday, like before 11am. Afterward it gets super busy. Also you can alternate between mimosas and bloody Mary's for bottomless.

OMG! This place is friggin fantastic! My sister brought me here who is an interior designer and usually when she drags me to house shopping places I groan (clothes shopping is more my scene) but this place is just so lovely! Mid century modern galore and merchandised to perfection! They had this amazing brass fish that we were both enchanted by and I've also decided that I need to redo my living room, bedroom and perhaps add on another living room so that I can fill it with more stuff. I will most definitely not groan when my sis takes me here again! Maybe I could get into this whole house shopping thing...haha one step at a time ;-)

I love the Duce! Such a fun place with something for everyone. Seriously- they have corn hole (aka Duce bag), ping pong, a dance floor (they play like the best of the 90s), a boxing ring and a store. And you can dress super casual! Love it love it love it!

Finding a good drycleaner is like finding a good man...JUST KIDDING. It's actually like WAAAAAY more important than that! All it takes is one time and one expensive designer silk dress that's carelessly ruined for you to be terrified to ever go to a drycleaner ever again.   Fear not! This place is great! Very quick, nice staff, inexpensive, and I've never had an issue with a garment here. Plus, your clothes don't come back with that weird "drycleaner smell" which is nice and they put these none slip foamy thingys on all of their wire hangers so nothing slips off. Aww how thoughtful! I mean, there's nothing more swear-word inducing then a freshly laundered drycleaned item falling onto the pavement due to slipping off it's hanger.   My only ONLY bone to pick is it's such a bummer that they are closed on Sundays. It's inevitable really on Sunday I will a.) Crave Chick Fil'a something fierce and b.)need something drycleaned. Sigh*

I love Butters! Great food! Everything I've ordered has been delicious but the chocolate chip pancakes are amazing as is the baked potato omelette. Yes; it is a long wait on the weekend but to me it's like "Um duh; people go out to breakfast on the weekend! What do you expect?" But I completely disagree with the people that say it's not worth the wait- IT IS; TRUST ME! This Scottsdale princess prone to extreme "hanger" (hunger induced anger if you aren't familiar with this term) would not wait for an hour on a Sunday if it wasn't worth it. Plus, once you're seated the service is actually super fast and they are good natured about customizing things which is good to know if you're picky like I can be. If you are a fan of breakfast you will be a fan of Butters.

I like this little store! They always have great toys! Some of my dog's favorites have come here. Anytime I'm in this shopping center I can't resist coming in here and checking it out. I don't think I've ever purchased food here but I've roamed those aisles and am impressed with the variety that they have.

Pros: Awesome selection of beers several of which are local. (I know; that's sort of a duh because it's a nanoBrewery). The food is really good, especially their flatbreads, and the staff is friendly and efficient. You can have your dog on the patio and they have treats and water for dogs which is fun. Overall, it's a good atmosphere and an awesome place to bring out of towners to show them a cool local spot. The other patrons are always nice and interesting as well. In fact, pretty much every time I've gone here one of us girls walks away with a date! Good to know for all of you single folks!   Cons: Parking kind of sucks. They do have free Valet but of course you still have to tip. It's not that big of a deal because they do have an ATM inside (which does charge a ridiculously high interest rate for withdrawals of course!) but still, something to keep in mind. Also, I feel like every single time I go there one of the toilets is clogged. Again, not that big of a deal but a pain nonetheless. And lastly, yes, it's fun that dogs are allowed on the patio and granted I know this is out of the restaurant's control so I didn't let it factor my rating, but some of the people that bring their dogs here are really stupid and ironically not what I would call "dog people." In other words, it's hard to relax because you're constantly trying to keep your dog under control but also other people's dogs at bay as well. Not a good time in my book.

Kelly's is by far one of my favorite places in Old Town for a night out. I like that it's casual yet still dressy and slightly upscale. You know what I mean? Like it still feels like Scottsdale nightlife but not what people think of as Scottsdale nightlife that has them fleeing to Tempe or Phoenix. Great house cocktails (AZ Mule is a must try) and generally a good mix between "beautiful people" and average folks. In fact, I would say the crowd is diverse by Scottsdale standards. I mostly come here at night but the food is pretty good too. One thing to note (and I say this only because I've seen many a person fall for this) there is one bathroom that is in plain sight and it's a onesie but that's not the only bathroom walk passed the bar and hang a left. I know, what a silly and unsexy thing to write about in a review of a sexy little bar but I know every woman reading this can attest that knowing the bathroom situation is important. :-)

So after a disaster of an experience at the Petsmart Pet Hotel and Doggie Daycare (read my review for more details), I was in desperate need of daycare for my 7 month old puggle, Penelope. Enter Doggie Suites!  Let me first take the opportunity to say how daycare is not a luxury for me...it is a NECESSITY! Like seriously, I will NEVER go back to the dark days of living without it! That being said it's super important to find a good one.  I took Penelope here today for the second time and love love love this business so far. The staff is so friendly (they remembered her by name today! Only after one day? Impressive.) and also the manager Shayna has experience working in vets, definitely a plus in my book.  I also like that they have other services such as grooming, boarding and even pet training. As a single dog mom that works fulltime, I don't have the time or will to find multiple places to take my dog so a one stop shop is a huge bonus.   Also, they send you photos and videos of your dog while he/she plays! How cute! Especially if you worry about your little fur baby like I do. Nice to see them having fun and making friends! Seriously talk about exceeding customer expectations! Well played Doggie Suites. Well played.

I decided to get back into barre and decided on TenPoint5 Barre Studio after careful Yelp research. I LOVE this studio so much! I'll break it down.  Instructors- I'm a triple threat...emphasis on threat...in that I am clumsy, ungraceful, and uncoordinated so the biggest challenge I face is finding instructors that aren't bitchy about it. These ladies are GREAT! So supportive and make it a point to learn your name early on and tell you when you're doing a good job or help you with your form. I've had some barre classes where the instructors are a bit snobby and won't help you but that's never the case here. They are all so nice and must truly enjoy helping women get in shape.   Design- It's beautiful! The space is long and narrow but I like it because you can always see the instructor. Also there's a window on the back wall giving it some awesome natural light.   Classes- HARD! But obviously in a good way. OMG I HATE the exercises with the ball! As in love hate because I'm sure they're working great. LOL Everytime the instructor says "Now grab you're ball" I'm like "AHHH! Not that ball please!" But I'm sure in time the torture session will pay off :-) Watch; next time I go to class the instructor's will be like "Read your Yelp review, ball exercises it is!" NOOOOO!!!! Haha. Also, it's worth mentioning that class sizes are small which is nice because you don't have to cram in to find space. I think the fullest class I've attended so far had 6 people. Awesome! Considering I've gone to the Daily Method and been in classes as big as 20. YUCK! You just can't get the individualized attention, in that size, you know?   Needless to say, I'm very happy with this place!

God I love this place!!! If you love sushi, getting your food quickly, only have $6 to your name and 30 minutes to spare welcome to your Mecca my friend. Well okay, let me clarify the speed: come during the week at night and at lunch on the weekends. I know that's probably obvious because that's how most restaurants are but worth making it clear. Everyone is different with what they consider quality sushi so let me break down what I look for: zero or very minimal "fishy" taste (check) more rolls that are raw rather than that fried crap (check) decent variety in rolls (check, though from my experience at night after 6pm offers the most variety) tightness of the roll or rather, does it fall apart easily? (Check, they do not). I suggest this place to anyone and everyone that mentions liking sushi; that's how much I love it! Try it for yourself!

I'm a big fan of chop shop. I love their juices (kale cleanse is the best) and I'm recently addicted to their protein bowls. It's hard to find healthier places to eat so chop shop is good to have in your back pocket. My only complaint/beef is it's sort of expensive for what it is but I worth it. You just couldn't eat here every day because you spend restaurant prices rather than take-out ones. I also love their patio (note- dogs are allowed!). It's a cute little place and considering so my businesses have come and gone in the space, I'm glad to see that this good one is probably here to stay.

Wow. EVO is damn good! Let me start by saying I hate Kale. Like I know it's super healthy but I hate it. It's trendy rabbit food, let's get real. My friend wanted to split the Kale salad which after saying "hell no" she finally convinced me so I begrudgingly decided to try it. Well...it was the most delicious salad period. You know you're at a good restaurant when they make the food you hate taste awesome. I concluded the meal with the bolognaise (sorry, I can't spell) and it was bomb too. Our server was very personable without being annoying and even made sure we checked in on Yelp to get the .01 lemoncello which I'm not a fan of but hey, a penny is a penny and we went to Old Town for a reason! :-)

This is a fun place! It's one of those bars/restaurants that appeals to both guys and gals in that it's casual but still a bit trendy and interesting not to mention the selection of burgers and beers to choose from (not that you couldn't have guessed that from the name).   They have a great selection of local brews (which I love). Pretty much any major AZ brewery is represented- Sonoran, 4 Peaks, Phoenix Brewing, Papago, San Tan the list goes on and on. This place is usually packed on the weekends and during major sporting events so plan ahead if you have your heart-set on coming then.   Overall, this is a good place to take distant relatives that your mom made you hang out with because "He's new to AZ and is going to ASU and needs a friend...blah blah blah" because it's loud enough that if there's awkward silence it won't matter. Plus, there's a burger for every palate so it's a safe bet.

I've been to Hula's a couple of times now and am definitely a fan so I figured I'd write a review.  Pros- Really good food, I recommend the Baja Fish Tacos, and the black bean burger- which is quite possibly one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had! I've been here for brunch too and everything is delicious and Hawaiian themed (cute). Also, GREAT cocktails! I came here yesterday for an event and ordered the Blood Orange Martini, YUM! My friend got the Painkiller and that was amazing too.   Cons- Okay so issue number one, it's sort of a weird layout. Near the bar they have two long tables that are parallel to the bar and even though it makes the space look modern and contemporary, I can't help but feel like it's such a waste of space. I get why they have them, for larger groups, but why not connect the booth's that are toward the front? I don't know, but I felt it worth mentioning since everytime I go here with a different person they say the same thing so it must just feel odd to all. Then again, I majored in design as did many of my friends so perhaps we're more sensitive to it then others. Again, this isn't that big of a deal because at the end of the day the food is great so who cares.   Issue number two- okay, how do I say this without sounding like a bitch? Hmm can't. Can the front desk girls please put on real pants? Seriously! Yesterday I saw a girl wearing worn-out yoga clothes and thought "Really? Who goes to a place like this from Yoga. That's sorta gross." Then to my horror I realized the girl actually worked there. WOW. Unlike the layout, you might want to re-think this one, Hula. You're too classy and cool of a place to allow workers to be greeting guests in what could pass as pajamas. Like seriously, bikinis would be less offensive at least that's in line with the theme.   But again, I come here often and really like it. Those are just my humble suggestions to make this place even better.

Okay...here's the deal with Bottled Blonde- this is like an awesome bar for your early 20's. However for my halfway to thirty (okay fine, a little closer than halfway) self, I've just well...outgrown it. I would prefer a more mellow place that's not as crowded and loud (god, I can't believe I just said that!). BUT here's how I would party here going forward:  Rather than waiting until 10 or 11 at night, I suggest you roll in after work and grab some pizza, drink and stick around for when it starts getting clubby. By then, you'll have a good buzz going.   I know what you're thinking, "Why the harsh two star rating when you've admitted that this place just wasn't your style?" Here it goes: what really bugged me was that someone shoved my friend out of the way while we were there. I turned around to see what bitch pulled that move and to my extreme horror saw that she was sporting the red hot shorts uniform. IT WAS AN EMPLOYEE!!! WHAT? How rude is that? I mean, I get it, my friend was D-RUNK and probably in her way but still. I would have complained to a manager but seriously it takes a hundred years to flag down a bartender, I can only imagine how much longer it would be to find a manager.

This place is okay. It's merchandised very nicely. I wanted so badly to buy something here but nothing really floated my boat. Also, the pricing was a little weird. I felt like some things were overpriced. Overall it was neat to look at everything and worth checking out. I will come back and see how it matures (I'm told the store is somewhat new).

Confession- My brother and roommate said "See ya, Liz. We're going to TopGolf!" To which I replied. "I love that place! That's the restaurant with golf right?" To which they laughed and said "Um more like golf with a restaurant."   Anyway- this place is pretty cool. I don't think there's really anything else like it in AZ but I feel like this place is so ridiculously popular now (any place that can convince my brother to leave the couch says it all) that a second location has got to be in the works, right?   Also, the food is pretty damn good! I was expecting it to be subpar just because you know how cool places like this don't really need good food. Just like a super model doesn't need to be smart, it doesn't matter. They've already got things going for them. But their food was super good! I had the nachos and they were tasty! Good for you, Topgolf, you're a smart super model or...eh whatever, you get what I mean.   My only complaint is that the service in the restaurant/bar isn't that great. It's a lot of young servers, which I don't mind, but they need some more training. For example, when I inquired about my drink after everyone had already been served there's don't say "Oh yeah, I forgot. It's been sitting on the bar this whole time, let me get it." Um...cool thanks, I'm sure it's nice and watered down, just how I like it. Haha. Or when we said we wanted to order some starters don't say "Did you want to order them now?" when we're staring at you. No, actually next week please. Thanks for clarifying. Come on! Ha but that's me being nit-picky and I'm coming from a place of love in that this place is too cool to be dragged down but silly servers. Then again, I am the dipshit that remarked "Topgolf! I love that restaurant!" lol so I guess the silly servers are in good company with a silly customer! Haha

This place is a nightmare! Where do I even begin? I need to make a list.    Atmosphere- Imagine a world (ahem waiting room) full of sick people coughing, babies crying...I'm sorry screaming, and an overall grungy vibe and you've got this place. Nasty people (customers and employees), nasty decor (or lack there of) and extremely nasty carpet. I would sooner walk on fire barefooted that in this shit hole. It's ironic to have blood drawn here because if you didn't have anything wrong with you before you probably do now! LOL  Service...actually I wouldn't call it "service" exactly- It's also run pretty inefficiently, it worked out for my benefit (truth be told) so I shouldn't complain but it would super suck to be at the other end of it. You make an appointment online (you are unable to call to set-up an appointment...odd) mine was for 5:15 but I arrived at 4:30 and made it known that I was early but would wait. When you arrive the blonde wicked witch at the front desk asks...no demands "Are you fasting?" which clearly isn't communicated well to doctors that refer patients here because I'd be a rich woman if I earned a dollar off of each person that responded with "What?" when prompted with that question...so you can guess that 90% of the time the answer was "no." Remarkably, they were seen anyway. What the hell? I didn't eat for 8 hours for nothing? So...is that just like a psychological experiment they are running on the side? Again, WHAT THE HELL??? But anyway, it worked out in my favor because it put me ahead of everyone else in the line (if looks could kill). Again, the blonde woman working up at the front is a heinous bitch! Clearly EVERYONE is an idiot besides her.   Experience? Job? I give up naming these categories- Then, I got with my phlebotomist who was a chipper, smiling and portly (I know, how horrible that I refer to her this way but it's relevant, I promise) woman named Edyen? I can't remember but something like that. She greeted me and tried to make nice conversation by telling me she liked my pants. Odd since they're yoga pants but I smiled and thanked her...she's trying right? She proceeded to tell me that I looked sexy in them. Again, odd but I thanked her and smiled. She then asked me where I got them? What brand they were? How much did they cost? OK OK OK! There's small talk and then there's....whatever the hell this shit is! She finally ends by asking What size are they? WHAT? RUDE! And creepy! Like what, you gonna ask to try them on next? Eww! To which I replied (my civility and patience now running on empty) "I don't know. Probably a medium." To which she responds with. "You fit into a medium?" As if she didn't believe me. I nodded, feeling humiliated and outraged. To which she ends with "Good for you, sexy!" What.the.hell.did.she.just.say? The irony is that I came here for blood work to start up on HCG again to lose the extra weight I've gained. What a dumb bitch! LOL but whatevs because apparently I'm also...sexy? Wait. What? While I'm reeling in an existential crisis of "Am I sexy or fat?" She pokes me with the needle to which I yelp (no pun intended) and she says "See, I found a weak spot!" I had previously told her that my vein's were hard to find because they were pretty deep under my skin.  Again, as the blood was flowing I was left wondering if the "weak spot" she was referring to was in fact my vein or her passive aggressive backward compliment? Insult? GAH! Even still I'm left with a weird spiral of what am I? FAT OR SEXY? FAT OR SEXY? FAT OR SEXY?  Amazingly, this woman asked me to fill out a survey for her! To quote her "If you have something positive to say, fill it out. If not, just leave it alone." Are you trying to intimidate me ma'am? I know, now I'm just acting crazy but this whole situation felt like psychological warfare! Anyway, this place feels like a layer of a modern day version of Dante's Inferno. It's actually so terrible, I kind of invite my fellow Yelpers to check it because it's hard to believe places like this actually exist in today's Information Age.
