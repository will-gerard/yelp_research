Tried the brisket and the ribs on two separate occasions. Food was overpriced, over cooked and was very dry. Even though it was drowning in BBQ sauce, it still didn't have much flavor.   Definitely wouldn't recommend this place if you are a true meat lover.

I originally brought my car in for service at a different dealership because I was having trouble starting my car in the mornings and evenings. The other dealership spent days trying to find out what was wrong but just kept telling me that nothing was wrong. I got fed up and decided to have my car towed to Tempe KIA on Monday night when I got home from work. Well, come Tuesday morning I was already getting a call from Tempe KIA saying they found the problem (I had a faulty starter). They explained that they would have it fixed in a few hours and that I could pick it up that afternoon. My car has been starting with no problems ever since.   Maybe I'm just extra happy with these guys because of the terrible service I got at Earnhardt KIA before taking my car here but the experience was definitely good. I will be going back here for all my service going forward. Thank you Tempe KIA, you have no idea how stressed I was before bringing my car in to you guys.

I've become an immediate fan of this place after just a few visits. They make fresh, healthy food that tastes amazing. Lots of options and the food always looks and tastes very fresh.   The service is very good and the staff was very helpful, giving me suggestions on what to add to my wrap to make it more delicious when I couldn't decide (there's so many options for mix-ins, greens, dressings, sauces, and bases).  The prices are very reasonable and the portions are generous. They definitely don't skimp on the portions and they have entrees starting at just $6. Currently this location is doing a $6 special on all the entrees but most of the entrees are actually $7 or $8 which still isn't too bad but it could get pricing if you're adding other sides, drinks, ect...  The place is very clean and looks nice but that could be due to the fact that the store just recently opened and hasn't gotten a lot of traffic yet.   I definitely recommend checking it out if you enjoy delicious, healthy food.
