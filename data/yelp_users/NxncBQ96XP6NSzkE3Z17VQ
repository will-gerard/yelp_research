Not a fan of the airport being 10 miles away from car rental... Easy to get around but plan extra time for the shuttle ride.

Room was clean as I would expect.  Walked up and down the halls a few times and a some of the rooms were pretty loud. It as soon as I closed my door I couldn't hear anything!  Just the way it should be!
