So I've lived near this McDonald's for years now. Each experience has been about the same, the food tastes old, the customer service is poor and the atmosphere always feels dirty. The only reason why I gave this two stars is because every once in a while I'll catch myself getting breakfast here and it isn't too bad. Overall wouldn't recommend.

Karissa is the best! Every time I come she memorizes what I like to drink and makes sure we are happy with the service. I definitely recommend Echo 5 to anyone looking for some great food and a great atmosphere!

I was extremely excited to eat at this location because it is really close to my work. I had an overall great experience, the workers were nice, the atmosphere was clean and most importantly the food was good. I will definitely eat here again in the near future.
