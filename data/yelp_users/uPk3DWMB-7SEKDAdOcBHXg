Earlier this evening I visited the hi-health store on Power rd in Mesa, having received a flyer in the mail stating that the store will match the price of any product from any retailer, given that the product number and size are identical. There were no exclusions listed on the advertisement and there was not a single asterisk on the statement indicating exclusions. I asked the sales clerk to match the price of a protein powder also stocked by the online retailer vitacost. The sales clerk reviewed the flyer, nervously shuffled his feet, staring at the ground for a few minutes. Finally, I asked again if he could match the price as advertised in the company flyer. He told me that he could not and that the flyer was false. Out of sheer principle, I asked him to check with his manager. He disappeared to the back room of the store and returned a while later to tell me that the manager could only match the price if a retail store existed for the online retailer (of course, the ad stated nothing about this claim, yet nonetheless, the sales clerk looked up vitacost and found that a retail store did, in fact, exist in the US.) He returned to the back room to speak with his manager who supposedly called corporate to discuss the matter and returned shrugging his shoulders, avoiding any eye contact with me and scribbling with his pen on the flyer. At this point, I asked to personally speak with his manager because I felt that a company who advertises a claim should honor it. I can only assume that the manager refused to speak with me since he/she never appeared despite the sales clerk returning yet again to the back room to converse with him/her. The end result was that the sales clerk would not honor the ad claim in what I've deemed the greatest display of unprofessionalism I've ever experienced. I will never return to a hi-health store again. Neither will my boyfriend, nor any of our fitness savvy friends. A company that refuses to honor its own advertising claims is just not a company that any of us are willing to support.

This place is amazing! The entire staff is attentive and helpful and the atmosphere is very relaxing.  I have had issues with my neck and back resulting from various sports injuries for years and elements is the first massage clinic that has helped to ease the pain.  For people who have moderate to severe day to day pain, this place is well worth the money.  The masseuse Renee is experienced, professional, and incredibly friendly.  She also possesses multiple degrees and certifications in massage therapy.  She found every painful spot on me and worked on it without my saying a word to guide her to it!

I've never posted a review for a medical facility before, but I had such a great experience with this place that I thought I'd share. I needed two separate MRIs that I completed on two separate occasions. Each time, the staff was courteous and professional beyond what I'm accustomed to when dealing with the healthcare industry. The technicians were the friendliest I've ever encountered. They made sure I was comfortable and offered to burn me a CD of my images to help me keep track of my own medical records. The machine itself is quiet compared to other MRIs and quick. By the time I was preparing to return for my second image, I was surprised to find myself for the first time actually looking forward to yet another medical test.

The food is amazing and everything is always made fresh to order at Thai chili. I have celiac disease and my boyfriend is lactose intolerant, but that doesn't matter here, everything is custom made to fit our needs and we never have to worry about allergens in our food.  Their precautionary procedures are highly developed because they care immensely that what you eat does not make you sick. The staff is friendly and the owner/manager is outstanding! He remembered us after just one visit, but now he knows us for a different reason-we come back every week!

Having lived on the east coast for most of my life, I didn't think I would ever find decent Chinese food in Arizona that was even comparable to what I'm used to. This place proved me wrong. The food is healthy, delicious and comes out fast every time. Plus, my boyfriend and I can eat a big lunch here for $15. I'm obsessed!!

Courtney is a rare breed among business owners. Her compassionate demeanor combined with her non-judgmental reception of all her clients makes for an outstanding experience. Skin sultry is truly a gem of a salon/spa in an oversaturated industry. It is so refreshing to find a beauty business that values it's clients over it's bottom line. If you're considering trying a new beauty procedure, don't settle for a business that will treat you like a number. Go see Courtney instead and you'll never need to search for a full-service, reasonably priced beauty boutique again.

We had high hopes for this place, especially since they offer a celiac-friendly menu. Our waiter was an inexperienced high school kid who took about 30 mins to bring us water and menus. I ordered a large soup and he brought me a small after we'd been sitting for over an hour and half. The waiter apologized for the mistake and ran back to the kitchen to correct it before I could tell the poor kid not to worry about it, that I did not like their soup anyway (it was extremely sweet for some reason). My boyfriend's entr√©e wasn't bad. None of the food or service came close to justifying the insanely high prices.

Anissa is a talented rare breed in an oversaturated industry.  As a 25 yr old who has tried nearly every practical color shade on the spectrum, I had yet to find a stylist who could minimize damage to a marginal level, while creating precisely the outcome I envisioned.  Anissa is that stylist who can deliver exactly what her clients are looking for, while preserving the natural shine and softness of untreated hair.  Passing the time in her chair is more a treat than a chore!  She is an undeniable sweetheart whose artistic flair and personality alike surpass all industry contenders, bar none!
