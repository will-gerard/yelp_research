So, you're saying that I can get ANY bottle off of the list AND my choice of bruschetta for only $20. What's that? I can start my bottle now and easily move with my meal and my server once my table is ready? And you say that I can do this on Monday and AGAIN on Tuesday, starting at 8pm? Every week? Can this be true?  Thank you, Postino, for having the best wine and food deal in the valley, and creating a great atmosphere in which to enjoy wine with friends.   I love wine. So do lots of other people that show up at 8pm sharp, rain or shine, to take advantage of the awesome Monday/Tuesday special. So be prepared to wait for a seat. If you are sharp like a hawk or stealthy like a fox, you might catch one of those coveted bar seats, but otherwise you'll stand at small tables, casually drinking your wine and doing some people watching until the host finds you and guides you to your table. You will love your wine selection. Your bruschetta will be made with the the freshest ingredients on crusty MJ bread, in the perfect proportions. Do try my favorites: Prosciutto, mascarpone, & fig; Red peppers & goat cheese; Ricotta with pistachio & dates; and Pesto with smoked salmon. Happiness served on a wood-cutting board. I paired my bruschetta with a spicy corn chowder, and it was just the best meal for a rainy night.   The servers are very cool and know what they are talking about. They will not steer you wrong with a wine selection. If you order a bottle that is not to your liking, no problem! They serve all wine by the glass, so you can easily send it back and try another! They want you to enjoy your experience and selection, and thus have built in the flexibility for people to take risks and try new wines. Have fun with it!   My suggestion is to find a friend or two, valet the car, put your name in for a table, get started on a bottle, make laughter and conversation, and finally take your seats, enjoy your food, and order more wine. You will be fully satisfied and will have had a great night. Do recommend it to your other friends, and definitely make plans to return again soon.

I don't know how I've never made it to Gold Bar before! It's slightly hidden, tucked back by the Basha's and slightly obscured by the Starbucks on the corner. It's definitely the eclectic, funky Tempe cafe I've been looking for. The decor is kitschy - stained glass, random art, cool colors, and great signs. Aside from the basics, their coffee menu has an impressive number of custom drinks with cute names. They  serve cakes and pastries, which I were told come from a Kosher bakery in Phoenix. The place is cute and cool, and the patrons seem to be a mix of students and musically-inclined hipsters. They are definitely on the pricey side, but it seem to be a good place to spend the afternoon working. They have live music on Friday and Saturday evenings, and classical guitar on Sunday mornings. I got my first Gold Bar stamp card - I LOVE being rewarded for eating and drinking.   My barista was awesome. He was personable and very friendly. He suggested I get my chai latte with a mix of vanilla and raspberry (his fave) and it was great. He presented my mug of chai with the prettiest Latte Art flower - I very much enjoyed Gold Bar, and will definitely make it a regular stop.

Perhaps one would consider me 'spoiled,' 'high maintenance,' or 'snobby' in regards to my standards for good food (and possibly in regards to several other personal attributes, but that's besides the point..). Having lived in Boston for many years, a city with greater ethnic diversity than Phoenix, I became accustomed to delicious and authentic Indian food. I had my pick from a number of excellent choices in Somerville, Cambridge, Brighton, South End, and the Back Bay..but here in Phoenix, the pickings are slim.   But good news! I have found my spot for Indian food in the Valley - Royal Taj. It is located in a shopping plaza in a shady-ish area of Tempe, but don't let that deter you from savoring the delicious flavors of India. The restaurant is a true family affair. If you've ever had the pleasure of knowing Indian parents, you'll just love the owners. Service is fast and friendly, and the atmosphere is homey. You'll hear the main proprietor calling out your order across the room to the kitchen, and soon enough, you'll have amazing food on your table.  Their menu is excellent, with a wide array of naan, tandoori, masala, curries, biryani, and saag. I thought their mango lassi was excellent - not too thick, not too thin, and bursting the sweet taste of mango. For dinner, they start you with these spiced crisps and dipping sauces, which surprisingly did an excellent job of whetting my appetite. The garlic naan was very good - I ate the entire order on my own! We ordered tandoori chicken and kahari chicken. The tandoori chicken arrived on a sizzling dish and was just beautiful. I thought its flavors were great and the half-serving was more than enough for one person. The karahi chicken was delicious and had just the right spicy kick. The basmati rice was aromatic, plentiful, and perfectly done. After dinner, they serve gulab jamun - sweet, sticky fried dough-like balls. Yum! Even my leftovers were amazing two days later! Next time I'll definitely try a masala, and maybe come in for the lunch buffet.   I still miss the diversity and options that Boston presents, but I have to say I am very happy to have found a really great place here in Tempe. Royal Taj is just what I was looking for.

Cowboy Ciao was like a roller coaster for my senses. Visually, the scene is stimulating: bold splotches of color on the walls, romantic gold leaf, dramatic lighting, rustic Old West, funky art and decor, and asymmetrical table placement creates a sense of artistic chaos and  charm. The aromas in Cowboy Ciao sent my olfactory bulb into overdrive, vamping up my anticipation (and appetite) for a most sensuous and savory meal. Acoustically, the restaurant was distracting. Muffled speech and loud laughter droned throughout the meal. I could hardly hear my new friends (including new Yelper Stan W.!) across the table.  My tactile senses noticed the comfortable leather chairs, and most importantly, the weight of the wine glasses - useful to notice when my glass was only half full! Finally, the food and the wine surpassed my gustatory expectations. I expected everything to be well-executed, but I was very impressed with the inventiveness of the dishes and the medley of flavors. The menu itself is a masterpiece, with quirky names for dishes, funky descriptions, and hilarious quotes - it is just fun to read through. My favorite dish, in addition to the perfection of the Stetson salad, was the seared scallops and beet risotto with goat cheese and dill. The combination of flavors was unexpected and to die for. I cannot deny my love for beets, but that risotto brought my appreciation to a new level. The exotic mushroom pan fry and the blue cheese cheesecake were also entirely unique, flavorful, and delicious. Stan W. was less impressed by his meal, but did swoon over the cheescake. And yes, it is swoon-worthy. As for the wine, the list is just extravagant (oenophilia-tastic)! With over 3,200 labels organized in a rather confusing manner, it is quite a daunting task to make the right choice; but with a little guidance from our gracious server, we were quite happy with our selections.   Overall, I was very impressed with my first visit to Cowboy Ciao. The atmosphere, the food, the wine, and the service make Cowboy Ciao a little gem in Scottsdale that easily suits every occasion. It is a wonderful place for a birthday dinner, a romantic evening out, or a fun night with friends. For out of town guests, this is a perfect stop for a unique and entertaining AZ experience. Ciao, a presto!

For an experience as close to the Sea of Japan as you can find in the Valley of the Sun, Toyama melds traditional Japanese cuisine with innovative presentation. The sushi chefs Mo and Giro create beautiful dishes with high quality fish. Fresh halibut, hamachi, toro, Spanish makeral - they only provide the best ingredients for their clientele.   You will find this small, unpretentious sushi bar in the far reaches of North Scottsdale, and it is very much worth the trip. Seating no more than 35-40 guests, you'll want to hurry to grab one of the prized seats at the bar. Tell the chefs your favorite fish, and they will prepare you something special off the cuff that you will love. Watching them work, you will see the precision and thought that goes into each slice of fish. They are also incredibly friendly and personable, and will happily discuss golf and sports, or their last trip home to Japan.   Our favorite rolls on the menu include the tuna tempura and volcano - both very interesting combinations of hot and cold, paired with their own unique sauces, so put your soy sauce away. The nigiri and sashimi is always fresh, delicious, and perfectly sliced. Make sure you savor every bite, and watch that your significant other does not try to steal your fish! On our most recent visit, we had a Sea Bass carpaccio that was excellent - served with green onions and toasted pine nuts, it was an interesting presentation of land and sea. We also ask for the 'Stanley roll', named after our one and only Yelper Stan W. It comes out a little different every time, but Giro puts some thought into creating something we'll love.   Definitely one of the best, if not the best, sushi bar in the Phoenix area. Highly recommend to all those sushi sensei seeking sushi perfection.

I'm addicted and I just can't get enough...just can't get enough!  In the past two months, I've eaten at 7 different sushi restaurants, including two in New York, and Toyama remains a slice above the rest. The intimacy of the atmosphere, the freshness of the fish, and the skill of the Itamae make Toyama an outstanding Arizona gem.   If you enjoy traditional sushi and have yet to visit Toyama, be sure to make the trek to North Scottsdale and you will not be disappointed. Mo and Giro will cater to your tastes and they will create something delightful.  If you go this week, try the red snapper!

Atlas you primordial Titan - you left me wishing for more.   Great concept, and truthfully, really great food. They offer a 3 or 4 course prix fixe menu that is creative, seasonal, and delicious. I just loved the root vegetable salad and the pork belly amuse bouche. The lamb was wonderfully done, although I did not think it went well with its bed of kale. Unfortunately, the scallops were cold and slightly chewy - I need my scallops to melt in my mouth.   The space is very small and intimate. Note that if you are seated in the middle of the room, you will feel like the other guests are very close to you. You may get bumped into as other guests head to the restroom (which is on the other side of the wine store, past the dingy mirrors, the wood-paneled bar, and the 1970s couch). I enjoy the fact that Atlas is BYOB, and that they are conveniently located within a wine store with a great selection. I do not like that they charge a corkage fee for a bottle of wine that they just watched me buy. Seems to lessen the experience.   And I think that is what is so disappointing.. For a place that boasts haute cuisine and fine dining, you expect a little romance, a little charm - more of an experience. Instead, you find yourself sitting in the back of a drab wine store, sipping overpriced wine, trying to avoid watching the neighboring table eat their meal. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but at this level, you are also paying for the atmosphere and the experience, both of which are lacking at Atlas Bistro. There are several other places in the valley that serve excellent, seasonal cuisine, and if you are looking for a place with charm, I recommend you go to one of those instead.

Pita Jungle has been making changes! New Happy Hour menu and Reverse Happy Hour Menu with lots of yummy offerings, including scallops, shrimp, hummus, baba ganoush and quite a few more. And don't forget the drinks are on special too!  Happy hour is 3-5:30 and then 9 to close. Pita Jungle also seems to be sprucing up the menu, with quite a few new offerings, rotating specials menu, and even an Earth Day menu! I had the mahi mahi on ciabatta and it was very tasty, though a little too much bread. I also branched out and tried the red lentil soup - I needed a re-fill it was so good!   And my date loved his tomato basil soup.   I find the food at Pita Jungle to always be healthy, consistent and flavorful. I love the lentil fetoosh salad - if you've never tried it, get it! And my next favorite is the pita burrito - who new that mixed beans could be so good?  I love that they are playing with the menu, and working to make Pita Jungle even more great than it already is.   The location in Tempe has a good location near ASU. They always have rotating art work for sale, and the space itself is very open and decorated very earthy and hip. The servers are very trendy and hipster-ish, and always very friendly. I do complain that the service is very slow, especially during this last visit. It may have been compounded by the fact that I was starving and it was 9pm, but the food took forever to arrive! But if you are with a fun group (they will cater larger parties - no reservations, but call ahead), the wait can be part of the experience.    Pita Jungle is definitely a regular stop for me when I'm craving something light, healthy, and delicious.

I've been to my fair share of mini-golf places, and for the most part they are all the same. But Golfland Sunsplash was a hoot! This was probably one of the nicest and well-maintained mini-golf courses I've been to in a long while. The grass was manicured, and the golf greens were smooth. All the structures had new paint and looked really nice. The golf hole attractions include a great windmill, a rocky stream (that your ball WILL fall into), and little general store; but the best part is the volcano! Every 30 minutes or so it erupts with flames! I really had a lot of fun at Golfland, and it seemed like all the other patrons around me were enjoying themselves, too.   Golfland Sunsplash also has an arcade, laser tag, and race cars - but I didn't try those out. I have been to the water park before, and it's a decent escape from the heat of summer. If you are looking for a few hours of entertainment, try out mini-golf at Golfland, and remember, no one is actually good at putt-putt.

My first yelp post! I use yelp so much, I decided I would start giving back. My Mom told me that my opinion matters - so I guess I'll start sharing it.  I've been to Fez about three times, and it is always very consistent. The decor is very urban and trendy - it makes for a fun atmosphere, and the lighting is great. The service has been great every time. I've sat at the bar twice, and the good-looking bartender - you know who I'm talking about - is very attentive, gives good recommendations and makes a good drink. Their wine list is interesting, mostly limited to vineyards with names that have double entendre or something crass in the title. They have a small tap, but a decent rotation. This time I had a Firestone IPA and it was great.   For the food.. I seem to be hooked on the lamb kisra. It is excellent, and perfect for sharing. The Fez kisra is also tasty, but a little messy, and the fries are very good. I've had the sweet potato fries and the spicy harissa fries, both of which hit the spot. The menu is fairly extensive, with some interesting options. I've found the ingredients very fresh, and I'm looking forward to trying other things if I can get myself to branch out from the lamb.  Overall, Fez is a great place dinner and drinks, and a fun spot to spend the evening. The people watching is great, it has a good location, and with the right company, you'll have a good time. I'm sure I'll be back again.

When cowboys ride off into the sunset, they probably stop at Greasewood Flat for a burger and beer. This rustic little bar is located a bit outside the city right near Pinnacle Peak and is definitely worth the drive! You'll know you are in the right spot when you see the antique farm equipment and suddenly feel like you are walking up to an Old West saloon. Say hello to the mule on your way in. Outside they have picnic tables, horseshoes, and fire pits (gets chilly out there in the desert!), and on the weekends they have live music and dancing.   Inside, the bar is pretty small, and the place is covered in dollar bills and business cards left by satisfied cowboys and cowgals. For the nights without live music, don't you fret, they have a jukebox with tons of country hits. The night we went it was the bartender's birthday, and the regulars were definitely having a good time.    Both a historic landmark (120+-year old original stagecoach stop) and a dive bar, Greasewood Flat is clearly special to Arizona, and is a definite must see. I'll be going back on a weekend to get the true Greasewood Flat experience and hopefully see a cute cowboy or two..

There are few things I love more than pizza. Its versatility gives you the leeway to combine interesting new ingredients, change the flavor and thickness of the crust, dress it up, or just keep it simple. I could eat pizza for every meal of the day - and have!  The pizza at LGO is really just what I needed this week.   LGO is fantastic. Their pizzas are very nicely done. They have really tasty combinations, like the fallen angel with local Schreiner's sausage, peppers, and fennel (fave!) or the rocket man with chiles and broccolini. The crust has a good flavor, and is thin and crisp. The servers are great, and the decor is fun and comfy- love the flowers. I've always wanted to try the wings, but am a sucker for the pizza.   When I come to LGO, my favorite thing to do is order my pizza at the LGO Grocery, shop around the fun selection of wines, pastas, cheeses, plants, novelties, and pastries, and then eat on the patio, or even in the back of the store. A very friendly ambiance, and otherwise a really great menu. Best yet, you can pick out a tasty treat for dessert, grab a bottle of wine and make yourself a nice little meal. The pizza at LGO is good, so go try it!

Essence Bakery and Cafe is amazing! Eugenia, you are a food goddess, and your staff is friendly and very professional. You have created my idealized bakery and cafe.   To start, Essence is one of the greenest local businesses in the Valley. They remodeled with green materials - recycled glass, bamboo, VOC-free paint. They use primarily re-usable dishware, the menu and carry-away boxes are recyclable and biodegradable, and they recycle. Best of all, and one of my favorite reasons for constantly suggesting Essence Bakery for lunch, is that they serve sustainable and organic products. From local veggies to grass-fed chicken and beef - fresh, local, and seasonal ingredients are packed into their excellent breakfast and lunch menus.   Eugenia sends out an email with the weekly specials that makes my mouth water. I love specials - I feel like I am eating something unique and limited that won't be around for very long. Specials also provide great insight into the creativity and skill of the chef, and I think demonstrate what is truly excellent about a restaurant. Today I had the brunch special - Belgian Waffles Served with Roasted Organic Apples and Sundried Cherries in Vanilla Syrup and Whipped Creme Chantilly - sweet heaven.   Lastly, I must mention the macaroons. Essence consistently wins the award for best macaroons. They are perfect, fluffy, and beautiful. Eugenia serves several flavors, including staples like chocolate, caramel, and raspberry, as well as seasonal flavors like pumpkin. They are melt in your mouth, make you go back for seconds good. If you want to taste excellence, treat yourself to an Essence macaroon.

Eccelente! I am constantly on the look out for Italian gente, and as soon as we walked into That's Amore, I knew I had found some.   It was late and a little girl was in the window. She told me her favorites: nocciola, amaretto, e stratacella - a woman of traditional tastes. Her father was cleaning up, and clearly ready to close, but he graciously served us. We shared short Italian banter - his daughter is clearly the talker in the family, and she loves to entertain.   Their selection of gelati is extensive. I have enough trouble choosing amongst 12 flavors, so this was just clearly going to be the biggest challenge of my night. I went with the little girl's faves - nocciola e amaretto. Delizioso. My date went for fruit - chocolate coconut and raspberry (lampone). Also excellent. The flavors are rich and the gelato creamy. Their store is fairly large and bright. Their display case is huge and its contents induce immediate salivation.  Two brothers and their wives run two locations. They are local, traditional, and a very nice family. I will definitely make the drive out to see them again. I love good gelato.

I found Armitage to be very enjoyable for a late evening drink and a snack. It's located in DC Ranch, which has a very swanky feel (note: except for the random Krispy Kreme right there on Market Street), and is a great place for a fun night out.   Armitage is pretty small, with a relaxed and classy atmosphere. There is a large bar area, high top tables, and a very nice patio.They have an excellent Tuesday night special - 1/2 a bottle of wine when you order food! Feeling flirty, I opted for the sangria (is that the red or the white?) - I got the white. It was brisk and tangy, but had no fruit! Next time I'll definitely choose a wine from their list - they also have very creative flights that caught my eye.   Our snack included the fries with three 'gourmet' sauces, and the ahi tuna sliders. The fries were great - not too greasy, very hot, and crispy. The sauces were tasty but nothing special. The half order is a good sized portion to share, although you might get to that point when you start worrying about nonchalantly gobbling up those last few before your date does..or maybe that's just me. The tuna was good - it was nicely spiced and perfectly rare - but the pieces were just so small it made each bite a bit disappointing. The bread:tuna ratio was completely skewed towards bread. Other menu items I would return for include the macaroni and cheese and the bruschetta - everything looked very good.   Armitage is a great place for a night cap, and I would definitely return during happy hour to catch some people watching - I was almost a little disappointed to not see any cougars. Overall, a very cool wine bar. Definitely check it out if you are in the DC Ranch area!

The barista warned me as I ordered that I was about to start an addiction. Two lattes and a hot green tea later, I am realizing the gravity of his premonition.  Cartel Coffee Lab has to be one of the coolest spots in Tempe. It is appropriately named as a place that would foster an addiction, and addicted I now am. It has the definite feel of an old warehouse. It is dimly lit, has high, exposed rafters and cooling vents, a concrete floor, and a usable garage door at the back. The layout is great, with a bar, several couches, and a good number of tables fully wired with plugs for the mac or pc-wielding crowd. It's a funky place, very urban; the main room is separated by an art installation made of bike tire rims. Cartel seems to attract a hugely eclectic group of patrons, from unbathed hipsters to ASU students to very cool coffee snobs. I sat next to the most interesting man, definitely a regular, and learned that he owns the old flour mill on Mill Ave! He also shared the most delicious almond cookie with me, baked by his father. Very cool.   Yes, the coffee. The coffee and espresso are fantastic. People complain that the service is slow, but calmatevi amici, they are making the valley's best coffee, to order, and that takes time! Their beans are direct trade, roasted in house. Try the espresso - it's perfect. Regular coffee fan? They use the Clover, a single serve machine that makes every cup special, just for you. They will alternatively use this awesome manual system with paper filters to drip your coffee nice and slow. I like that they make you commit - large or small - and they keep their menu very simple, so you'll need to get your vanilla lattes elsewhere.  Their default milk is whole (so good), from a local organic farm - and so remember to ask for skim if you are watching that waistline. The baristas are super cool and friendly, and gave me a great welcome.   Cartel is my new favorite caffeine haven. Thank you friend of a friend for the recommendation - I am a convert, and have definitely found my Tempe fix for a great, independent coffee house. I may have a hard time going anywhere else! (Don't worry Lux, you're still my first love, I promise.)

La Bocca - I've got a bit of a love-hate thing going for you. I love your classy, trendy decor - romantic lighting, dark colors, interesting art and wall treatments, and very comfy chairs and couches. I hate how crazy busy you can be, with so many others calling for your attention, slowing down my service and forcing me to yell during conversation. I love your wine list - lots of great choices (some good beers too), good happy hour and reverse happy hour specials, and 1/2-off bottles of wine on Sundays/Mondays. I hate how you treat me sometimes - you barely greet me when I sit down, you make me wait for my delicious drinks, and you forget what I ordered. I love your food - the olives are divine (and local), the goat cheese and pear salad is perfectly dressed with a perfect combination of sweet and salty, and the bruschetta boards have great variety and great ingredients (my favorites are the prosciutto & fig, and the salmon & capers). But I also hate your food - I'm sorry, but I do not like that your 'chewy' crust covers 2/3 of the pizza. It's just not right - I deserve more toppings than that. Last time you gave me a total of 4 truffled mushrooms, a smattering of spinach leaves, and WAY too much crust (and believe me, I love crust). My pizza was soggy in the middle, and it was even soggier last time when you brought me the sicily pizza. You leave me feeling disappointed; I thought you said you'd bring me the best.    Alas, La Bocca, I love you, and I hate you, but ultimately I always come back. Your charm is irresistible, even if you don't give me your best all of the time. I love your food enough and your wine more. Your specials keep me interested, and my hope for delicious pizza on Mill keeps me hooked.  You're great for a tasty meal and a fun night out - you're sassy and I like it.

Sweet Republic is a haven for frozen treat fiends. It is definitely one of the best ice cream parlors in the Valley, and according to the Food Network, creates one the Best Things I Ever Ate: Toffee Banofi sundae. Um, yes, I concur. I try to get a weekly sweet treat from Sweet Republic, and I am working on branching out from my favorite flavors to try all of their amazing creations.  The Bananas Foster ice cream is just fantastic - sweet, subtle flavor of banana in ice cream form. I do not usually care for banana-flavored foods, but this is just so tasty. Of course, I also LOVE the Salted Butter Caramel, the Madagascar Vanilla, and Belgian Chocolate. The sorbet flavors are outstanding - for a huge pick me up, try the Basil Lime; for just fruity deliciousness, get the Coconut and Strawberry. Sweet Republic also does interesting flavor rotations, including Honey Blue Cheese, Bacon, White Truffle, and other holiday themed flavors. You could try a different flavor every week!   Sweet Republic also has a menu full of amazing sundaes and ice cream creations. I love the ice cream sandwiches - my favorite flavor between two chocolate chip cookies - what could be better!?   Now, be warned that Sweet Republic is not to be considered inexpensive. They have small servings and they aren't cheap. But, the extra money is worth it for those who enjoy fresh ingredients and local charm. If you can't make it to Scottsdale, check them out on Twitter to find out where their Chevy truck might be headed next!

With a name like Aria, you image wide open spaces filled with natural light, sweetly smelling fresh air, and a sharp, sophisticated air of luxury. To this end, the Aria is a masterpiece. The building is a glass-encased wonder, with the casino and corridors open to the heavens, allowing the gorgeous Nevada sun to light the space. The natural light truly makes a difference compared to the other casinos with their harsher ambiance. The casino smells good! Not sure what they do to combat the smoke, but it is working, and the Aria smells lovely. The building is LEED certified Gold, and the designer went a long way to include unique design elements that open up the space and keep your stay a little bit greener.   There are over 4,000 rooms in the Aria Resort, so be careful not to lose yourself or your party. Each room has a panoramic floor-to-ceiling window that provides lovely views of the mountains or the Vegas skyline. The remote controls everything from the lights to the curtains, all from the plush comfort of the bed. Ultimate comfort. The bathroom is a tad small, especially for sharing, but overall the rooms are lovely.  With all of its luxury and beauty, you expect to be treated like royalty. Or at least as well as the King's 2nd cousin twice removed. Instead, you might as well be Vegas peasantry, begging at the door of the palace. Several others have also commented that their reservations were not what they requested. We reserved 2 double-queen rooms, non-smoking. We received 2 King rooms, smoking. Apparently a 'reservation is only a request and is never guaranteed.' Well fine, but please do not charge my credit card 2 weeks in advance if you cannot guarantee me my room. And please do not treat my party as if we are making outlandish claims - you made an error, please correct it. They offered us a 3rd king room for only the first night, which was not good enough. They refunded the rooms, and we moved next door to the Monte Carlo. Although the rooms were not as nice, we were treated very well.   The valet situation at the Aria is a little chaotic, but they valets are very friendly. Thank you to Nicholas for all of your help! The Aria is connected right to City Center, which makes for a great Vegas strip location close to delicious restaurants and shopping. There is a free art museum attached, and a supposedly beautiful pool, Liquid Pool Lounge, only for adults. Unfortunately I did not get to experience either. I would try to stay at the Aria Resort again, hoping for better service and a 5-start experience.

Since October, I have had an obsession with the Pho at Blue Moon. Since discovering this little Pho jewel, I've probably come for dinner 14 times - 3 times by myself (I can't believe I'm admitting this to you..). So, clearly I'm a Pho-lover, and as far as Pho goes in the Valley, this place serves some of the best. It's run by a very nice Vietnamese family - always friendly and smiling. The location itself is small and modestly decorated, but it's bright and clean and usually full of people! Most of the times I've come, the majority of the other patrons have been Vietnamese families, which I'd say is a good sign for the authenticity of Blue Moon.   Soup has to be one of the most comfortable meals around. At Blue Moon, they serve traditional Pho with rare steak, tripe, and tendon, and also have brisket and meatballs. Don't be shy, get the large! I alternate between rare steak and meatballs, the chicken pho, and then the pho with veggies, and I load each one with a healthy squirt of sriracha hot sauce, sprouts and basil. The veggies usually include carrots, bok choy, and broccoli - colorful, crispy, and plentiful. Love it. If I am very hungry, I start with the egg rolls - shrimp and pork goodness in a crispy wrapper.   Although I only ever order the Pho (they have a 50% off special - $3.50 for a great meal!), the rest of their menu looks delicious. They have family dinner specials (for 2 to 6 people) with several different dishes that are a great deal. They have other noodles and soups, as well as meat, chicken or tofu dishes served with rice. They also have seafood appetizers and main courses, like sauteed clams or salted catfish. One day I'll branch out from the Pho and try the other Vietnamese delicacies, but for now, I am hooked on Pho!

Yay for local businesses! It was Saturday morning. I was driving through Tempe, in desperate need of a banana, organic tea, and a juicy anjou pear. I stopped into this darling little market and felt happy. I found just what I wanted and more! I had been on the hunt for a good turnip all week (it was for this soup I was making in celebration of my ingredient of the week, which was cauliflower, in case you were wondering). Sprouts was out of them, Sunflower didn't have any - I thought I was out of luck.  But lo and behold, Tempe Farmers Market had the best looking turnips I've ever seen! I was thrilled. They're from the local Crooked Sky Farms, which made them that much better.  Tempe Farmers Market is definitely still growing, and figuring out what customers want. I ran out to my car to get cash instead of using my credit car, and Darl, the proud owner, caught up with me to ask me if I found everything I needed, and wanted to know if there were any foods or goods I would want them to carry. Love that! He was great to talk to, and seems genuinely interested in creating an awesome local market. They have lots of local foods, from Crave ice cream to artisan bread made in Tempe, to local cheeses and produce from nearby farms. And they're friendly to boot. Support them! Tell them what you want! Buy your fruits, veggies, and breads there, and you'll definitely go home a happy customer.   Oh, and by the way, the soup came out delicious thanks to that turnip. I'll definitely be stopping in more often for my regular fruits and veggies. I am so glad the local movement is coming to Tempe.

5th and Wine is becoming quite the Old Town hot spot. Just 6 weeks since its doors opened, it seems to be quite popular for dinner and drinks alike. There was quite the crowd Saturday night, which made it loud, but it had a very fun atmosphere and is definitely a good place to go for wine with friends. Everyone I saw seemed to be having fun. The space is huge, having two dining areas and a bar. If you have a big group, no problem, they can definitely accommodate larger parties. The decor is really fun and classy - red or brown leather chairs at all the tables, lovely classic furniture (couches, arm chairs) in the sitting areas, polished wood rafters, great art on the walls, and a very cool bar area showing off their collection of wines.   The service was very attentive and friendly. We actually had two people serving us, and received wonderful recommendations and information on the food and wine. Our host/server introduced us to both the sommelier and the chef, and they were a pleasure.    I thought the wine list was great, and has a nice range of wines and prices for both glasses and bottles. All the wines are $5 a glass until 6pm, which makes it an outstanding choice for lunch and happy hour. We decided on a smooth tempranillo and were very pleased with the selection. I found the food a bit hit or miss. We sampled the mixed olives (I love olives), which were really good, and had the cheese platter with goat cheese, white cheddar, and grana padano, served with pistachios, dried fig, and toasted bread. The cheeses were excellent and I could have eaten that all night. We tried four bruschetta, and the only one I really enjoyed was the mozzarella burrata with basil and grape tomatoes. You really cannot go wrong with burrata  - so good! I had issues with the other three: the hummus was tasty, but a little drippy and unexpectedly spicy; the red/yellow peppers were bland and the goat-cheese was overpowered with garlic; finally the prosciutto, fig, & mascarpone, normally my favorite, was disappointing. Maybe I was unimpressed by the bruschetta because I went to Postino earlier this week, but I do believe they could jazz up the ingredients a bit. We also had the pesto pasta which was non-traditional and creamy, but tasty.   5th and Wine is really a concept in progress. They are trying to sell themselves as a trendy place for 'comfort food.' I think they are currently in the midst of an identity crisis, and just really need to commit. It is hard to be both a neighborhood diner AND a wine bar. If you are going for comfort food, where is the macaroni & cheese, or the meatloaf, or the chicken noodle soup?  If you want to be an accessible, yet trendy wine bar, then maybe stick to lighter dinner fare? I am confident they will figure it out as more customers let they know what they like. I think they have a casual loungy wine bar vibe  that definitely suits the decor and most of the menu (as opposed to a more upscale and elitist feel at wine bars like Kazimierz). I will definitely be back to have more wine and see what direction they decided to go with the menu. Get some friends together for happy hour and check out 5th and Wine!

Thank you, Jay and Chef Payton, for bringing Boa Bistro to East Mesa. Boa Bistro is a much welcomed and superb addition to the nonexistent food scene in Mesa. I now have three Mesa foodie spots to frequent, and Boa Bistro might be my favorite in all the Valley.   Yes, Boa Bistro is very new and still in its growing stages. The staff is in training, the outdoor patio not yet complete - but, I found the atmosphere and service to be top notch. The wait-staff is very friendly, professional, and helpful. Kristen at the bar was wonderful. The decor is modern, with a large white bar, funky lighting, and a clear, walk-in wine room that boasts the impressive selection of wines. This location is smaller than the one in Tempe, but that only adds intimacy to the experience.   The best part of Boa Bistro is the wood-fired oven and Chef Payton's station at the front of the restaurant. If you can, sit at the bar and you'll be able to watch Chef Payton and his very friendly sous chef, Scooter, in action. At their station they prepare the salads, roast the oven-fired entrees, slice the meats and cheeses, and even assemble the desserts. If they have a moment, they might deliver your course to your table and give you an explanation of the dish. Both Chef Payton and Jay, the owner, took the time to say hello and welcome me to their new location. They are a lot of fun.  The menu is simple, highlighting the fresh, locally-sourced ingredients. There are a few familiar dishes from the Tempe location, including the mussels and the shrimp starters, the Panzanella salad and the mushroom ravioli. The rest of the menu seems new and delicious. I very much intended to have the meatball bruschetta and the gnocchi carbonara, but was seduced by the $30 menu special of the night: choice of salad to start, choice of fire-roasted trout (for 2), mussel entree, or MN meatloaf, and choice of dessert (tiramisu, brownie, or cappucino).   The Panzanella salad is the perfect winter medley with marinated mushrooms and butternut squash. The trout is beautifully served as a full fish, cleanly de-boned with skin-on, cooked with almond butter and capers, and served with an arugula salad and green garlic-potato puree. Divine. The tiramisu is award-winning, with the perfect proportion of deliciously fluffy mascarpone cream to espresso-soaked ladyfingers. The entire meal was excellent and was served at a leisurely pace that is ideal for savoring every bite. The pacing of courses is something that many restaurants need to learn, and one aspect of my experience at Boa Bistro that I greatly appreciated and enjoyed. Relax and enjoy the food!  Boa Bistro is a foodie paradise. Local, fresh ingredients, outstanding menu and wine list, intimate setting, and personable Chef and staff.  Drive out to Mesa and try it! You will not be disappointed.You can follow Chef Payton on Twitter (ChefP8n) and get great updates on specials and daily ingredients. Buon appetito!

It's early Sunday morning, and, as I often do, I want lox. Lots of lox. In the past we went to Kashman's, but the times are a changing and JJ's Delicatessen has improved on our usual New York-style deli. To start, breath easy, because Lupe is still there, greeting you warmly as you walk in and making sure you find a seat. He's great. The menu has changed a bit, and there is a sports theme running through the menu and the decor. The new owners seem to be Mets fans, and my beau may or may not hold that against them.   We ordered  the L.E.O omelet (Lox, eggs, & onions) and the veggie skillet. They both came with a bagel and schmear, and the omelet also had a side of fruit.  Everything was freshly prepared to-order and came out quick. The staff was very accommodating when something came out wrong and quickly addressed our concerns. I greatly enjoyed the omelet - it was simple, and had the right proportion of lox to eggs. I might have peppered it up a bit more, but I like food with a kick. The veggie skillet was also very good - lots of potatoes, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, peppers and cheese! You can order the skillet with any combo of veggies, meat, and cheese. Come hungry, because the skillet is a serious portion! The bagels and schmear are made in-house and are pretty good - not exactly like my favorite New York bagels, but a nice compromise. I do need to return to try the knish!  I thought the prices were a bit steep for a delicatessen, but perhaps the prices go with the portion size. Some things seemed to be priced correctly or even slightly under-priced, like the skillets that come with a bagel, or the omelets that come with a bagel and side of fruit or potato ($10 or less). Other dishes, like the lox platter seemed a bit steep ($10.95). Then again, I'm not sure how much lox come with the platter, so maybe it's not such a fishy deal after all! I'll have to investigate the other menu items and do a little more price comparison to decide.  Overall, JJ's is a welcome addition to the neighborhood and a great place to stop in for Sunday brunch, or any time you are craving some Jewish comfort food.

How is Bio Bistro not yet in the Yelp-osphere!?  This has been my on-the-fly, go-to place for sustenance when busily working away at ASU. It is located in the Biodesign building at McAllister and Tyler, across the way from Psychology. It gets very popular at lunch time, being one of the few easy options on this side of campus, and it definitely beats fighting your way through the sea of undergrads at the MU student center.   The barista at Bio Bistro is great - a little rough around the edges and he tends to take his time making your drink, but in the end it's worth the wait because he makes foamy latte goodness. They serve 2 types of espresso at your request for the picky espresso drinker in all of us. The strawberry lemonade is also great, and they have a decent assortment of teas. Do remember to stop in after 3pm for Espresso Drink Happy Hour! Half-off all espresso drinks. I know I definitely need a pick-me up around 3:30 to get me through the rest of the day.   The coffee is a great deal. The food, not such a great deal. I am a sucker for the tuna sandwich, the veggie korma (with yogurt and chutney), and Cajun delight pizza - they are all really tasty and surprisingly satisfying. They also have sandwiches, bagels, pastries, and salads - you can grab something out of the case or get a sandwich made to order. I just find the prices a bit high for the food, but, when I'm hungry and in a hurry, I pop on over for a bite and a latte.   Bio Bistro is quick, easy, and good - check it out if you find yourself wandering around campus!

Hog Trough Smokehouse BBQ is a great place to stop when your driving through Wickenburg! Right in historic downtown, the Hog Trough is a quaint little BBQ spot with a cute old-time Western decor. I loved the shelves of antique cookwareThe aroma of BBQ that hits you as you walk in is amazing and makes your mouth water. The place is family-owned and super friendly. I think I got a glimpse of the Pit Boss in the back preparing some corn bread. The Hog Trough specializes in smoked meat that they slow smoke for 8 to 14 hours - brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken, links and St. Louis style pork ribs, referring to the way the ribs are butchered. I had the pulled pork and pork ribs with BBQ beans, potato salad, and cornbread. Yum!! Everything was great and I quickly wished I had ordered more cornbread smeared with that delicious honey butter. I think I would have liked the meat itself to be hotter, but the pork was tasty and I enjoyed the BBQ sauce. Whatever recipes they use for the beans and the potato salad are amazing! I'm not a huge fan of beans and potato salad and never willingly order them for sides, but these were really good. I'd happily go back just for those sides!  One thing that I was not a huge fan of was lack of real dinnerware. I know it's a BBQ thing to eat from Styrofoam containers with plastic cutlery  - but I'm just not into it. It kinda makes me feel dirty and I don't enjoy the food as much. But I know that's just me and doesn't really take away from the quality of the food. However, I'd love to see a small local place like this move towards a more sustainable kitchen, with real dishes, more natural food products (like Abita root beer instead of Barq's), and Arizona-raised products. This place would really shine.   I highly recommend stopping in on your way into or out of Phoenix! So much better than any of the fast food along the way.

Old world ambiance in a retro-vintage space with a modern touch and a killer chef. Fabulous indeed.   The fine folks from FnB are taking over Old Town with their local-loving style and three fresh concepts: Baratin, Bodega, and AZ Wine Merchants. The focus, as always, is great food, great drinks, and great vibes. And no one would be able to pull it together so beautifully as the FnB team.   Baratin is that quaint café you stumble across while exploring the streets of Paris - or in this case, the Kiva Center courtyard on 5th Avenue in Scottsdale. Peeking through those sky-high windows, you will catch a glimpse of casual, café dining at its finest. Clean lines, reclaimed Ponderosa wood bar and tables, a mixture of vintage and modern fixtures, and intriguing art set an intimate tone that warms the room. In its very small space, Baratin is set up to serve a clientele looking for a casual yet intimate place to stop for bite to eat. Baratin will serve the best that Arizona has to offer in a few ever-changing plates: A snack, a salad, a veggie, a meat/cheese plate, a sandwich, and a dessert, served alongside an ever-changing menu of half bottles of wine, local beer, and dainty cocktails. You can choose your seat to overlook the lovely courtyard and take in the vibe, or you can sit at the bar to watch the magic unfold. With only 28 seats, you will always be in the best seat in the house.  Fact: anything that Charlene Badman makes, you will love. The opening sandwich was amazing: Tender Belly bacon, butternut squash, goat cheese, greens and crispy onion on focaccia. The veggie was amazing: grilled broccoli with fried egg, whole grain mustard aioli, butter croutons and olives. And the citrus marinated olives served with grilled bread was, of course, amazing.   With its changing menu and very reasonable price point, I imagine Baratin will be a place to stop in (very) frequently to satisfy those foodie cravings and share a bottle of wine. As FnB's flirty younger sister, Baratin is definitely catching my attention.  Before you leave, take the tour of the small Bodega. You'll find a tiny foodie paradise filled with delicious Charlene creations, locally-sourced veggies, cheeses, oils, and meats. There are adorable aprons for sale, and Sweet Republic ice cream. What more could you need?   Baratin-Bodega-AZ Wine Merchants - one-stop for all of your local, foodie-loving needs.

The food may be good, but I wouldn't know since this place asked me to wait for over two hours to be seated for a table for three.  To be fair, we went in on a Friday night around 7:00 with no reservation.  There were quite a few people waiting for tables and the restaurant was overflowing with people.  I placed my name in with the hostess and was informed it would be a 45-55 minute wait.  Fair enough - seems like a reasonable amount of time to wait on a Friday with no reservations. We wasted time by walking around Scottsdale Quarter and having a juice drink at True Food. We ventured back to Sol and were able to find a spot at the bar.  I had the skinny margarita, which was tasty enough, but nothing special. My guy had the house margarita and he said it was average.  After an hour of waiting, I went to check on our table. The hostess said it would be another 25 minutes for our table to be ready.  We were enjoying the people watching, but growing hungry nonetheless. We decided to wait sice we had already waited this long.  After another 35 minutes, my beau, who is not as rational as I am, went to speak to the hostess and was told it would be yet another half hour. At this point we were looking at a two hour wait with no end in sight. How could we trust them not to ask us to wait another 30 minutes? We left, but not before my cranky guy chewed out the manager. Maybe you could chalk this up to the growing pains of a new restaurant, or the inability of a young staff to properly gauge the wait and manage their tables, but my experience left me thoroughly disappointed and I will not be going back to try the food any time soon.
