I love this place!!!! I wish I worked closer to them, I love all the sandwiches here. I truly cannot pick a favorite. But I've tried the turkey green chile, the egg salad, the chicken salad, tuna tulip & the meatloaf.... Oh the meatloaf!!!! Literally everything tastes of homemade perfection! The gals are always so friendly, they remember the orders literally every time someone calls. The phone is constantly ringing, because the food is ADDICTING. When I do have the chance to stop on by, I definitely make the stop.  Man, I want some meatloaf now.. *sigh*

I came in on a Groupon- a savings for a $200 value. I needed to save all I can since I am on a limited budget. I had a great experience here, I wasn't sold on anything extra they were very accommodating with my budget and explained to me in detail everything I am paying for. I am beyond appreciative of the facility, and was impressed with the cleanliness. The office is small and cozy, very personable. The doctor was very nice. Staff was helpful and very courteous to me arriving 30mins before my appointment. I cannot wait to get my glasses.  My suggestion to reading these other "deal" purchasers, if you already have glasses/contacts and have a pretty basic idea of what you are supposed to be getting, you honestly shouldn't be too surprised that you will have to pay a little bit extra for what your eyes need. I really doubt any deal out there will include EVERYTHING because everyone is different. The groupons/living socials/amazon local deals are NOT on there for FREE EVERYTHING. Be appreciative you are able to get the basics for a great deal, they are on there to attract new business and allow people to experience a new facility.  I know that I need a "hi index" lens, so I know I always have to pay extra for that. So the doctor recommending the same thing I've been told every time I go means he was doing his job. I don't mind paying the extra for the lenses because I know what I need, well, the basics of what I need.   Thanks for the great deal! My eyes really needed it!!

This place is awesome! I've never had a bad experience here. Food is delicious! I'm addicted to the vodka penne pasta dish with chicken! Super YUMM!!! I order my stuff to go & I never have to wait long. Staff has been friendly every time I pop in & the cookie pizza thing is another delicious item!!!

I took the Defensive Pistol class for women & had the BEST experience. All my questions were answered and the instructor was phenomenal.  Don was more than qualified to teach the class as he knew quite a bit. I felt beyond comfortable leaving the class and more informed about safety first. I had never held a gun before taking that class and was completely afraid of guns in general. But being well informed and learning about them, from my opinion, an amazing instructor, I am not so afraid anymore. I would need some more practice though and cannot wait to get back on the range and participate in some more classes.

It my 1st manicure & I brought my 3yr old w/me.. They were happy to have her sit, pick out nail polish & do her nails. The receptionist even let me know about a special they were running, they saved me money so I could enjoy the time w/my daughter. My manicure was amazing! We had so much fun together, I will definately be back all the time!

The store never has enough employees working. There is usually only one checker, it's pretty annoying when you're just in there for a quick minute. Almost every time I've been in there, the side departments are always closed, no matter the time of the day. Same with customer service. I do enjoy the work ethic of Jon the manager there. He's always helpful.

Everything is ridiculously delicious! The atmosphere is wonderful (just not around lunch time, it's crazy busy)! The entire room smells so fresh & clean, I love that I can see the fruit they use. It's a really great place. My 4yr old loves the chocolate dream smoothie! And it has avacado in it! It's so delicious! The bowls are so yummy & filling! You truly cannot pick something bad on their menu.
