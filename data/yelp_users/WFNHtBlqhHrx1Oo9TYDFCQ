We were killing some time before jumping off the stratosphere and decided to have lunch here. Our waiter seemed uninterested in our service. I had a hard time understanding him due to his thick foreign accent. My wife had a philly cheesesteak which she said was awful...and my omelette was very bland... the cheese wasn't even melted. The manager seemed nice asking us how things were, but definitely wont go back.

I have eaten here several times when I am down in Phoenix. I usually order a child relleno, cheese enchilada and rice. Also their chicken and beef dishes are great and not too dry. Great chips and salsa. The overall quality of the food is excellent. Very good customer service. One of the best Mexican food restaurants in the area. Give them a try.

My wife and I went here for some serious seafood. I don't know why so many people are bashing this buffet. I started with a variety of seafood.. lobster tails, crawfish, mussels, crab(cold and hot), shrimp(cold and hot), stone crab claws, raw ahi tuna, sushi, cajun shrimp, several varieties of fish, prime rib and that was just the first plate... awesome...especially with tons of melted butter. The service was awesome ..What else do you want?

Damn... I cant find anything negative about this place except that it isnt near my house. My wife and I decided to check it out being that we were in Vegas and are fans of Man vs Food. I was concerned that it was just overrated due to its extremely large portions but no longer. I had to try the fried chicken eggs benedict that I saw on tv. OMG it was huge! My wife and I split it and we still couldn't even come close to finishing it. It was f#%king amazing! The sauce was sooooo good. Also the bloody marys arent to be missed... they make their own mix every day and it is awesome! I cant wait to go back to vegas just to have breakfast here again!

I'm always looking for good Pho so I tried here. The atmosphere was a little hectic as there were a couple small children running around like crazy. Not sure if they were related to the staff or not. I got calamari which looked and tasted like the basic frozen rings you can get anywhere. The broth of My Pho was decent but the noodles were very chewy. I had to bite through them with my teeth. Overall not impressed. Hopefully it was just a bad day.

I've never had a bad experience at Pappadeauxs. I've been here at least a dozen times and have to say that the food and service is always outstanding. There are so many delicious looking items on the menu that it is tough to decide what to order sometimes.       I'm combining experiences here. I recently drove 200 miles round trip to have lunch here. My waitress/bartender Erin was awesome.      Appetizers... alligator is unbelievable. I always ask for it blackened instead of fried... sooo good. Shrimp and Crawfish fondeaux is sooo good yet so bad if you're on a diet. Don't miss out on the oyster duo.. cooked 2 ways. Mediterranean calamari is great, also crab cakes, oysters on the half shell...you get the point.      This place feels cajun and gets you in the mood with its ambience. Fresh fish, great food, service and generous portions are what Pappadeauxs is all about. You won't be dissapointed.

I have only been here once, but it was a great experience. The servers seem to make a point to ask and remember your name which is nice. I had Ling's seafood hot pot, which was great and served in a neat black kettle. There was an assortment of seafood in a green curry broth. It consisted of shrimp, scallops, mussels and fish with your choice of rice. They are not skimpy on the seafood. It was loaded. Great atmosphere and service. I will have to try more of their food if I am in the area again.. And maybe update my review.

My wife and I went in for dinner after seeing good reviews on yelp. Overall it was a good experience. I've never done all you can eat sushi before but when the sushi chef recommended it... I said yes. He told me that there was no difference between ayce and a la carte menu except sashimi. You can also order any appetizers as well! We ordered many different rolls and nigiri and all was excellent. Our chef suggested many other things which we said yes too and most was good like the fresh scallops nigiri. The grilled calamari was so tough it was unedible...minus one star. Otherwise... it was a great meal without limitations on what you can order.. we will definitely go back.

My wife and I wanted to have our anniversary dinner at GR Steak and let me tell you... it was fantastic! We were brought in on schedule at 6:30. We were given some interesting details about decor as we were taken to our table. Unfortunately the table was in a dark corner on the first floor with a wall for my view. I politely asked if we could get another table and our request was granted without hesitation... a table at the bottom of the stairs with a perfect view of the action. Our waiter Alex was excellent... answering every question we had and not making us feel rushed. We ordered wine and the chorizo stuffed lobster tail for an app and it was outstanding! Next we ordered our entrees... the rib cap for me and the infamous beef wellington for my wife. The rib cap was amazing as well as the wellington... melts in your mouth. My wife and I got the asparagus and mac and cheese for sides respectively... and let me tell you it was the best mac and cheese Ive ever had! Then it gets better... dessert is sticky toffee pudding... omg... I have never tasted any dessert that can even come close to the synergy of flavors that Chef Ramsay gave me. All I can say is Chef Ramsay delivers on all levels... from the food... to the service... to the atmosphere... this is an experience that you will never forget!... ever!

I was nearby the first time I went and decided to stop in after seeing the Yelp reviews. The restaurant was clean and staff was friendly. I've ordered a different Pho each time and have been amazed at the quality. The broth is incredible. The spring rolls are also amazing. The prices are very reasonable. This is the best Pho I have found in Phoenix.

I haven't eaten too many Banh Mi sandwiches but this was the best by far. I ordered the shaken beef. Very fresh tasting ingredients and outstanding bread. The restaurant was very clean and modern. The service was very friendly. I will definitely be back to try more.
