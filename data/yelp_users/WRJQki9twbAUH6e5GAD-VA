I have been here many times.  And ironically, the worst meal I ever had from the place is the reason why I am writing a 5 star review.  Every experience I have had here has been great.  Their firebird chicken pasta is awesome, they cook steaks right and season them well, and the place is cozy.  A few days ago, I took my fiancee here and she got a burger and I got steak tips.  The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as I come to expect from the place.  I had no intention of complaining, or changing my opinion of the place since I've always had good meals there.  But, the manager came by to ask how the food was when we were finishing up our meals.  I didn't even know she was the manager, she just seemed like a nice person who worked there and was genuinely interested.  So I told her the truth.    "I've been here many times, I always enjoy it, and this meal wasn't bad, I just wasn't as good as usual when I come here." She asked if I had tried this particular meal before, and I told her I had not.  I even told her I don't mean to complain, because it really wasn't bad, and I certainly will be here again.    After a brief chat, (she was super pleasant) my fiancee and I finished up and waited a minute for our bill. Our server came over and said "Don't worry, this meal was compliments of Firebirds. My manager said you guys discussed your experience with her and were very friendly, and we appreciated your feedback and the fact you were really nice about it, and she wants to make sure you always get the best experience possible when you come here."  I was floored.  I even told him the food was not bad, and neither was the service, and she didn't have to do that.  He insisted, so I left him with a really nice tip and my and my fiancee walked out of there as happy as can be.  I was really impressed with how they handled my honest feedback, and I always have a good experience at Firebirds.  This place is managed right, that's for sure.  Extremely impressed!

Younger crowd, tables are priced high compared to some of the cheaper casinos nearby, but the women that go here are better looking.  The dealers are more stoic than some of the cheaper casinos and drink ladies are slow but the rooms are always nice, even the cheap ones, and the pool is filled with hard bodies at all times.

I had a service scheduled. I took work off to be available for it. Nobody showed up. I contacted who I believed to be the owner (turns out it was just the owner's daughter telling people she owned the company) to find out why my service was skipped. She said her father wasn't feeling well and they would need to reschedule.  I would never pay money to get serviced from such an unprofessional company.

Will never dine here again.  It was my birthday. Kinda packed. They sat us outside. Took literally 30 minutes to get my first drink. Beer came warm, obviously poured a while ago. Took 40 minutes to get my second beer. This time it was cold because it was right after I complained. Got my $72 Kobe, ordered medium rare. Came blue. I complained again. They took my steak and cooked it again. At the time they took my cutlery and plate too so I couldn't even eat sides while I waited. Steak came back cooked properly in the center but now it was charred. Also did not have the same consistency as you'd expect for a Kobe. Actually tasted frozen (tho I don't believe it was, just tasted that way). We got free deserts for our trouble and spent literally 3 hours sitting outside mostly unattended (except the water boys who did just fine) - bill was astronomical. Didn't get the sparklers and stuff that the people with the birthday in the table next to us got (that's what they always do) - most frustrating customer experience I have ever had in a "high end" steak house.  Do not recommend.

It's basically the only bar near my house.  For that reason alone I like it.  It's the place I go when I need a quick escape.  And when I walk in it's almost as if the theme song from cheers starts playing: "Where everybody knows your naaaame.  And they're always glad you caaaaame"

I'm a guy, so I don't do the mani-pedi thing too often unless I am on a daddy daughter date and my kid makes me do it.  So, I've done it 3 times.  The first 2 were terrible.  One lady bruised my shins from massaging the bone so hard.  Then I went to Estrella.  I walked out of there feeling like I was walking on air.  I don't know the girl's name who did mine, but I'm going to go in there again and find that same girl.  She was amazing!

It's a little on the pricey side for a west side sushi place, especially considering the place across the street which is much less expensive.  But, the sushi here is better.  It never has that fishy smell that some sushi places have.  The bar tenders and sushi chefs are really nice and chat you up a bit.  The servers are all pretty but could be a little more chatty or attentive.  Not a fan of the live music they have there sometimes, it's a bit loud and annoying when you just wanna eat but it doesn't stop me from going there.    Most importantly, it's a sushi place, and the sushi is pretty darn good.

Went there to for the late games on NFL Sunday with a group of 4. On a bill that should have been in the 150 range (we each had a few drinks and one order of nachos to split), our waitress charged me a whopping $267. She also had the gall to have gratuity included already on the check, even though I was only with 3 other people. They literally tried to steal money from me, and I will never go to this place again.   I came to find out last night that one of my friends paid his tab on the way out as well. His tab was included on mine.  And as if the stealing money wasn't bad enough, the service was terrible.  On a positive note, the place was a fun place to be. Fun and friendly crowd and a really nice facility. It's a shame they are running a dishonest business, because it's a place I would have started going to for NFL Sundays despite the bad service.

I was just served a drink with mold in it. I would never have known if I didn't drink the whole thing then dump the leftover ice. Disgusted, I brought the empty cup back to them, still with mold chunks on the inside of the cup. The manager said he would refund. Then I watched him walk back to the drink machine, talk to another guy who shook his head no, and he came back and said he could only offer me a refund on the one drink, or a free drink to replace it. Insulted, I told him I don't care about the 2 bucks. No apology. I just walked out as they continued to pour drinks from that same moldy fountain.   Absolutely disgusting. I will never eat at this jimmy johns again.

First time checking the place out. I'm not one who usually enjoys western themed restaurants or bars, but this one is kinda quirky and different and something about it feels inviting and fun. We stopped by for lunch on a Saturday. Not enough people here for some reason....  I was impressed with the menu- they have actual good food not just typical bar food. Their menu seems a bit unique, playing on the modern western theme they have going on with the decor.  The thing that really inspired me to review this place was the quality of the food and service. Never once had to ask for a refill and our server was very attentive. Got the cowboy tacos, and they were like no tacos I'd had before. Western cowboy BBQ meets south of the border. I didn't expect the food to be so, fancy, I guess you could say? Seriously, delicious. Different, in a very good way.  In fact, everything that came out of the kitchen for our lunch was cooked to perfection. Fried pickles and sweet potato fries for appetizers, and the tiny hint of cinnamon and freshness of the sweet potato fries really set them apart. And the fried pickles were still crunchy pickles, not soggy bar food style garbage. My date had the french dip and her fries were perfect and she was really pleased with the sandwich as well.  Both of us walked away impressed and wanting to go back. Sure hope this place does well, because it would be a shame for the location and lack of foot traffic to result in this place not staying open long enough for me to try the other stuff they got on the menu!  Great beer selection too, and the TV set up is perfect for sports fans. Definitely will be back, and highly recommend this restaurant.
