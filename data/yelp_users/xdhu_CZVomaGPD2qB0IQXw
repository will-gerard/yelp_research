It seems like(judging by the previous reviews), Ichi Ban may have changed their staff out recently.   Jamie and I have been frequenting this gem since early January 2009, and we're in love with it.  we've never sat at the hibachi tables--only at the sushi bar, where Johnny(san) has been endlessly friendly to us.  I always order the 'Cucumber Special'--sliced cucumber rolled around spiced tuna(maguro) with pickled, sliced radish, sliced crab, and wasabi. Jamie has tried nearly everything on their menu, but his favorite has been the roll filled with grilled freshwater eel, cucumber, deep-fried crab, etc...all deep-fried.   for dessert, Johnny-san would always slice up some oranges, mangoes, etc(all free). also--pre meal, you get a complimentary bowl of perfectly-seasoned miso soup, and sometimes, complimentary edamame pods--salted and wonderful :D  honestly, we were frequenting Ichi-Ban weekly, but we haven't had the time to go there recently. so my upcoming review will be much more detailed...sorry :( bottom line is, the service is spectacular, the food is phenomenal, and we love the place. this is what REAL sushi is about.

Absolutely horrible. We booked a room last night, got in there and there was NO heat. I called the front desk, and the snippy concierge told me that, nope, there's no heat in the rooms because we're in Arizona. It's been getting down to the 20s every night! She says, "I can give you some extra blankets". We gtfo ASAP, got our refund, and went to the Super 8.

Whenever I'm in the mood for a little pool and a little hookah, this is where I go...plenty of tables, plenty of hashish flavors(I'm partial to pomegranate, myself), and an internet jukebox(I tend to pick "Master of Puppets" by Metallica, "Don't Stop Believin" by Journey, and we LOVE to torment everyone with the 19-minute long 'Goodbye, Sky Harbor' by Jimmy Eat World, haha!)...

Being a well-seasoned Indian food consumer, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for delicious, authentic Indian cuisine.  We always order the samosas(stuffed with potato and well-seasoned) and the paneer naan(cheese-filled bread--it's become my fiance's favorite thing on the menu lol!)...I also ordered their aloo papri chaat(read my 'Crown of India' review for a description) and it was top-of-the-line...nice and creamy and crispy!  It's been a month or two since we ordered from Maharaja, so I can't really remember what else we've gotten, but I know that I've had no bad impressions of their fare...try it out!

One of my fiance and I's favorite restaurants, Tokyo Lobby has a great atmosphere and even better food...  we always start out with the gyoza...the dumplings come out hot and steaming, with the perfect, slightly crisped skin...  last time we were there around lunchtime, and my fiance ordered a teriyaki chicken bento box for his meal--tempura veggies, teriyaki chicken, rice, 4 rolls of sushi, and a salad with some sweet dressing, all for $7...incredible!...  I ordered my usual--the Glendale Roll(lobster-filled sushi rolls, deep-fried and drizzled with a sweet, slightly spicy sauce)--the most incredible thing you'll ever taste, and my favorite food on the planet!  Tokyo Lobby has the atmosphere and service of a fine-dining restaurant without the priceyness...a great place to have fun eating!

sooo filling...we ordered the hummus appetizer(your average, creamy rich hummus), the tzatziki appetizer(tangy, cool yogurt sauce with green onions), and the flaming feta appetizer(fried feta cheese mixed with a creamy, spicy sauce...not awfully spicy--incredible), all of which came with pitas...  I also ordered 1 spanakopita to go with my falafel+rice plate)6 crispy, spicy falafel balls over yellow rice, into which I mixed tzatziki and hummus...mmmm...  Jamie had the shawarma wrap(massive, and with some hard-to-place spice that was absolutely tantalizing)...  I was definitely reeling after that meal :p

Well, being an 11-year Yankee fan, I have to dock a star for the Red Sox theme, haha!...but otherwise? I love this place!  First off, they're directly across the street from my new place, and I just turned 21 :p...and the location is ideal for my status as a non-driver haha...  Another plus--cheap, DELICIOUS, *different* bar grub: deep fried ballpark pretzels with nacho cheese--sizzling hot with real salt; wings(10 for $4 during Happy Hour!) in 6-7 different flavors--we got medium wings, and they tasted like they'd been cooked in a clay oven, sooo smoky and mouth-wateringly juicy, too!; they have 5-6 different salads, 10-12 different burgers(including one with crunchy peanut butter!), and 8-9 different appetizers(like a corn dog with tater tots!)...  anyway, I digress...on to the most important reason this bar rocks--ALL MY FAVORITE BEERS ON TAP(except for Red Stripe--that's bottled)...they've got: Killian's Irish Red, Leinenkugel Sunset Wheat, Sam Adams Summer Ale, Newcastle Brown Ale, AND J.W Dundee's Honey Brown(my #1)...  also, the bartenders have been super friendly, except for kind of a dirty look when I accidently spilled beer on one guy's newspaper crossword(in my defense, it was piled up with a bunch of other newspapers on a table, and I grabbed the section to read the funnies--didn't think anyone was using it still)...  so. Nate's owns.

lovely. absolutely lovely.  ate here a few weeks ago with the hubby and a friend of ours. we'd just discovered it several days prior(despite the fact that we've been living 2 miles away for 2 1/2 years!).  we sat outside, where the guys ordered a pizza(which they loved), and I had a salad with walnuts and cranberries, whilst enjoying a delicious Czech beer.  in between conversation, sips of beer, and before our food arrived, we nommed on some great, warm rolls with a bit of soft butter; just the thing to whet the appetite.  the ambiance was perfect--intimate, cozy(especially on a cool Autumn night), and quiet(despite being seated amongst several full tables--the conversation was a dim murmur). another plus? fantastic service.  the prices were a bit on the high side, but definitely worth it--and definitely worth a return visit(or two) before we move next month.

So, we came home 2 days ago to find one of those irritating menus left on the doorknob, so we took it inside and left it on the floor.  Yesterday, I was craving some Chinese food when, lo and behold!, what should I stumble upon? The previously discarded Chopstick Express menu. Now, I don't have terribly high expectations of Chinese food outside of New York, but we were pleasantly surprised by both the price and flavor of our meal.  Jamie was coming home for lunch, so I ordered delivery--the shrimp in lobster sauce Lunch combo for me, the mongolian beef Lunch combo for him, then an order of potstickers and a quart of honey-dipped chicken.  Wow. I've been searching EVERYWHERE for boneless honey chicken, and this did not disappoint--it was slathered in this sweet sauce, yet still crispy!   the Lunch combos come with fried rice, a cream cheese wonton, and a spring roll--all steaming hot and very flavorful. my shrimp in lobster sauce was delicious, but nothing special; it tasted pretty much just like it had at the last place, and the place before that.   the mongolian beef, on the other hand, was phenomenal! tangy, crispy, maybe a little too salty, but still incredible...it almost tasted  like it had been cooked in teriyaki sauce.  another plus--we were worried that Jamie would have to bring a frozen pizza back to work with him for lunch, since they said the food would arrive at about 12:45(when he leaves for work again)...but they showed up at 12:25! so..yay :)

this place has REALLY gone downhill. we used to live nearby, and came here regularly for karaoke. it used to be friendly, warm, and just a great place to be. now? they treat customers like garbage, and they don't stock toilet paper in their bathrooms. avoid this place, there are better bars not far away.

I. Love. This. Place. :)  I spent a good amount of money there, but on a wide variety of items:  *foot-long wooden leaf ashtray with green-painted porcelain veneer *5-inch-long black cigarette holder(with rhinestone studs!) *square, metal, yellow-and-black subway-style wall clock *ADORABLE 19th century re-print (cartoon) of 2 cats(caption: "Isn't it nice to be in love?') *vintage 60's/70's(hard to tell because the style is so classic) floor-length, cream-colored, scoop-back, sleeveless gown(only $25!) *vintage black negligee with lace bra cups($8!)  also--on the counter, they have a basket FULL of vintage airline and hotel matchbooks for 50 cents each...that's what I call 5 different kinds of AWESOME :p  and...I'm sure there was more, but...wow! I have to go back to soak in the rest of the store--it's fascinating :)

So, after reading all of the lovely reviews, Jamie and I tried Sushi Eye last night...and I must ask of you who loved this place: have you EVER had GREAT sushi? I mean--phenomenal sushi? because the rave reviews highly overrated this place.  We went during Happy Hour, and it was pretty empty. The wait staff was friendly and attentive...the MUSIC, however, was awful--SO not conducive to eating, ruined the ambience, and basically ticked me off--it was loud, loud techno-pop, singing about 'getting undressed' and whatnot. sorry, there's only one time of week I want to hear that, and that's on Friday nights, when I'm out dancing, thanks.  anyway, on to the food: I ordered the edamame(not as salty as it ought to have been, but passable), and the cucumber salad(actually very different--tangy and refreshing, though I wish it would have had more crab meat in it)...the MUSSELS, however, were absolutely to-die-for...probably the most delicious and satisfying thing we ordered last night--swamped in a sweet, creamy sauce, they complimented the Plum Wine well...  as for our entrees--I ordered the Spicy Scallop roll--slightly spicy, pretty good. Jamie had the RSM roll--deep fried, smothered in sauce, but still NO FLAVOR, somehow...the tuna they used in the roll was delicious with the sauce, but the actual batter was bland, as were the 'Spicy Calimari' bits...the only thing with any nuance of flavor was the sauce they came with.  now, the reason I'm being so hard on S.E is because I've tried Tokyo Lobby, over in Glendale, and let me tell you: if you want AMAZING sushi, where everything has a punch of flavor, and you can taste every ingredient, make that trek over to the West Val...it is, by far, the #1 sushi eatery in the valley, hands down.  sorry, Sushi Eye...it was edible, but that's about it.

loved this place!  we got here at around 10pm on a Thursday night...it was dark and only the bar and lounge were open, dimly lit and super-intimate(which I loved).  Jamie wasn't terribly hungry(and I oughtn't to have been, but I kind of was)...so we ordered the artichokes(soaked in a lemon-basil olive oil--tender, a bit greasy), the foie gras(crispy with smoky-sauteed mushrooms and sweet cubed apple), the clams(AMAZING--only slightly spicy, with a kick of lime and cilantro, nice and buttery with a hint of white wine), and the butternut squash ravioli(a bit of a letdown--the squash filling needs FLAVOR--more sweetness, more spice, something).   we also had the Ice Wine flight(the apple wine was divine--so sweet, but not sticky. the Franc had a bit of a perfumy taste to it, but it didn't last long and I loved it. the Vidal Blanc was complex and delicious. and the Jaden Pinot had a similar perfumy taste, but was more alike to the Vidal)...they were all spectacular.  for dessert, we had the S'mores(way better than I'd ever hoped--soft and super RICH, with whipped, toasted marshmallows)...they were amazing with the Bordeaux Labory(which was a very good wine, indeed--not intense, but with strong flavors of lead, which were absorbed and weakened by the thick chocolate of the S'mores)...we also had the Creme Brulee tasters...also kind of a letdown. the chocolate and vanilla ones had strong flavors, very rich...but the other two were basically...blah.  after everything, I had the Gruet Grand Rose, a wonderfully strong, not overwhelmingly sweet bubbly from New Mexico.  oh! and our server, Dina(Deena?) was awesome...she and I turned out to both be from the NYC area, and she gave us some confidential places to check out when we head to Manhattan next week :)

I lovelovelove this place. the variety of breads/pretzels/sausages and other meats, as well as soups, snacks, pickled delicacies of every kind...wow.  we stopped in yesterday, and left with one of their horseshoe-shaped soft pretzels, a bag of pretzel sticks, and the most AMAZING creamy dill-lemon-caper-honey mustard...  next time, I'm stocking up on their myriad varieties of gummy candies :)

I LOVE this place...every time I go there, I keep meaning to try a different entree, but I can't tear my appetite away from the *excellent* gnocchi!...thus far, I've tried (by picking at other peoples' food) the potato pancakes, the mushroom soup, jager schnitzel, bratwurst, and the German chocolate cake...all incredible and ridiculously filling...and the waiters have been so friendly(not to mention, rather good looking haha)...

This place reminds me of my black Southern heritage...all the down-home cooking, the friendly owner and cooks...it all makes me remember my grandmother's cooking(of course, I can remember that whenever I go to visit her, but Restaurant 28 is a bit closer to home than the 40 minute drive to downtown Phoenix haha!)...  anyway, I've discovered my perfect meal from their menu: George's catfish(blackened and seasoned to perfection and so tender and greasy!) with hush puppies or crispy-moist fried okra and the INCREDIBLE sausage casserole...it all comes with a dinner roll and I always order a slice of the pecan pie for dessert...  this place will leave you full and HAPPY!

Alright, well seeing as I work right next door, my mouth has been watering over this place ever since I laid eyes upon the menu. And tonight, we finally had some yummy Rumbi take-out.  First things first: they're a little pricey, at first glance. However, their portions are *enormous*. Each of us ordered a full size bowl(Honey Orange Shrimp for me, Jamaican Jerk Kalua Pork for Jamie, Honey Orange Kalua Pork and Teriyaki Chicken for Jamie's parents). The full size bowls were more than enough to last the average person through dinner, and then through lunch the next day; packed full of rice/noodles, meat, and veggies, with each bowl containing a ramekin of sweet teriyaki sauce.  The shrimp in my bowl was perfectly tender and succulent, the Honey Orange sauce sweet, but not cloyingly so. The bowl came with a lime wedge, which added the perfect zing to the mellow coconut "Rumbi rice".  We also ordered some of their Bahama Mama's Tortilla Soup, which was a creamy coconut-based broth filled with chunks of grilled chicken, tortilla strips, and melty mozzarella. It was a good, cozy soup, but could have benefited from more depth--some tang, some spice, something.  For dessert, we had some of Rumbi's Key lime pie--moist, rich, and delectably sweet with a lovely measure of sour. Only complaint? The graham cracker crust was too mushy, soft, and crumbly; it would have been much better with a crispy bed under the pillowy-ness of the Key lime filling.  All in all? Great place with reasonable prices, given their generous portions. They have a TON of salad options, as well, each more inventive than the last, and I'll be returning to try and test each one :)

What an experience!...this had to have been one of the most filling, out-of-the-ordinary restaurant forays I've ever had...  we started out with the traditional panchan(small, complimentary appetizers)...I especially liked the kongnamul(cold bean sprouts in sesame oil) and the mu-chae(julienned radish in a sweet, vinegary sauce with chili powder)...  we hadn't expected the overabundance of extra food, and so had ordered another appetizer--the seafood pancake. It was, in truth, delicious, until I started actually *looking* at it...this may sound a little immature, but once I saw all those long tentacles, I couldn't eat it with the same wantonness...I had to labor to pick each rubbery arm out before I ate a slice of the(pizza-size) pancake...nevertheless--wonderful!...  when it comes to entrees, I honestly can't remember what I ordered(probably something 'safe' and 'healthy', and therefore, 'boring' haha)...I only remember picking off my fiance's barbecued beef...delicious...  we were so ridiculously full by the end of the meal, that when dessert came, it was quite refreshing--a bowl of sikhye--simple, sweet, rice water...a perfect ending to a great meal!

I really can't say enough about this place; clean, with rather prompt service(although several of my servers clearly don't know English, and I had to hope a manager was around to interpret the fact that I need an entire carafe of water).  their variety is fantastic--sushi(I prefer the deep-fried rolls--but be careful, it's hit-or-miss with some of the fish in the sushi rolls), endless crab legs on Fridays, tons of dumplings, shumai, scallion pancakes, rangoons, wontons, fresh fruit and edamame, etc etc

So, last Saturday night, Jamie and I were invited out to Jug 'n Barrel by our friend John Pomeroy, who is the chef there. It was nice and empty when we got there, but had a cozy ambiance with warm lighting and bookcases with games and magazines, and lovely soft music(though we left just before the live music started).  For hors d'oeuvres, I ordered the Olive Bowl(a great variety of Greek olives served with herb crackers) and the mussels(both Jamie and I's first time trying mussels--sauteed in garlic, served in-shell, and so wonderfully buttery they melted in my mouth--though Jamie wasn't as fond of the inherent mussel-y taste)...  Jamie ordered the Croque Monsieur...black forest ham covered in melty Swiss cheese and white truffle oil, served open-faced on toast(more like Texas toast, it seemed like)...it was so crunchy, cheesy, melty(yea, sounds like a Taco Bell commercial haha), that, although I've NEVER liked Swiss cheese, I sincerely enjoyed the few bites that I had. The Croque was served with string french fries that had just enough golden crunch and just enough softness to rival McD's...  I had the salad(can't remember what it was called), with seasoned, toasted walnuts and rich crumbled bleu cheese...John told us the walnuts were rolled in cayenne pepper and rosemary, and let me tell you--I'm a sucker for flavored walnuts in salad, be they with spices or with sugar, so I LOVED it...the salad came drizzled in a champagne vinagrette that paired nicely with Jamie's wine: the to-die-for Rosa Regale Banfi Sparkling Red...that wine was SO good that I've bought it from Whole Foods 3 times since visiting Jug...it's rich and thick(not syrupy, just not barely-existent, like most sparkling wines)...and it tastes like rose petals and strawberries :)  also, during the meal, John brought out a special he had created--2 juicy steak medallions drizzled in honey balsalmic--Jamie's reaction was "That could be the only sauce I'd eat with steak, besides A1"...it was lovely...  anyway, definitely going back there, monthly, for their wine-tasting Thursday nights, as recommended by the chef :)

This place is very off-the-beaten-track, I'm sure most people overlook it....I only came across it whilst searching online for somewhere 'different' to eat...and when I came across the review on the Phoenix New Times website(http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2005-02-10/dining/sultans-of-shish/), I knew this was it...  I only docked a star for the (extremely) sparse decor and atmosphere...this place could have been any other type of business with just a change of sign and omission of tables...  anyway, the food was great! my fiance ordered skewers of beef and lamb(I'm not too keen on lamb, but the beef was tender and succulent...very well spiced!)...I had a cucumber salad(diced, along with onions and parsley, and soaked in vinegar-lemon juice), which enchanted me so much that I created my own version at home and make it every time I feel like doing a bit of dicing(msg me for the recipe--it's a bit death-breathy and labor-intensive but delicious!)...  and, during dessert, I could see why Samarkand was voted 'Best Tea in Phoenix'...the black tea was easily the best I've ever had(besides a special brand of blue ginger tea I make a point to keep my cabinet stocked with)...it was strong and rich...absolutely incredible!  definitely make it a point to search this place out--it's worth the effort!

The worst Thai food I've ever had! This place was recommended to us by another couple, and wow was I disappointed!  Everything was completely blase and tasteless, the only exception being the extreme spiciness of my fiance's entree(probably to make up for the lack of other spices)...  don't bother with this place.

okay. wow.  so, after reading reviews of Sabuddy here on yelp, we decided to make the long drive out to Scottsdale and have some middle-eastern fare...definitely an adventure worth having and gas money well spent!  it was quite empty in there(an hour before closing time), and the service was very attentive and friendly, the music pleasant and conducive to eating...  we started out with the labne(sweet cream cheese with spices and olive oil, served with warm pita)...it was okay; just normal cream cheese...I aimed for the olive oil when dipping my bread...  Jamie ordered the Israeli meatballs(covered in red sauce, perfectly seasoned and tender and served over savory rice, with tender, well-cooked green beans, carrots, and chickpeas--delicious)  I had the tabouleh(THE BEST tabouleh I've ever had--and I've had a lot!)...it was marinated in the perfect mix of lemon juice and olive oil..the bulgur was almost crispy, not soggy, mixed in with the chunks of tomato and parsley leaves.  I'm partial to adding hummus to my tabouleh, so we ordered a small hummus plate(creamy, a bit garlicky, but not overly so, and with a nice sprinkling of paprika on top, served with 2 more warm pitas)...  along with my salad, I had 2 falafel balls(only 50cents apiece); the best falafel I've ever had--a crispy, spiced shell surrounding a moist, tender, mushy center...kind of like middle-eastern hushpuppies, seriously and utterly incredible!  for dessert, we were convinced to buy the baklava and lemme tell you--I don't know what one of the other reviewers on here was talking about--it was moist, crispy, and drizzled in what seemed to be a cinnamon/honey/coffee sauce...we also ordered a pot of Turkish coffee--rich and hot with definite chocolate undertones...absolutely perfect and in barely any need of sugar after the supersweet, supersavory dessert.  we're already planning our next trip--he wants to try the shawarma, and I'm dying for the schnitzel and many, many more falafel balls!

we went to Skye for our 1-year anniversary(March 2007), and it was pretty much what I expected it to be...very pricey, but worth the expense for a special occasion.  we were seated in the lounge, where a(very talented) singer was breathing new life into hits by Sade and other great artists...the ambience was wonderful!  first things first: the bread basket--warm pumpernickel bread with sweet, soft butter...always so comforting!  for our appetizer, we ordered the coconut shrimp, which was wonderful--large, juicy, evenly coated with crisp coconut, and served with sweet teriyaki and spicy wasabi...  for my entree, I ordered the shrimp puerto penasco--slightly spicy with soft, mouth-wateringly good risotto--perfection!  he ordered the st. louis pasta, accompanied by plenty of sweet sausage and covered in a creamy tomato sauce--we had to bring the rest of that one home haha!  for dessert, we ordered the cheesecake 'lollipops'--3 chunks of cheesecake(chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry) on sticks, covered in chocolate and served with raspberry dipping sauce--wow! that was the piece de resistance, for sure!...but *before* our dessert was brought out(to go--we were pretty full by then), they brought us a slice of flourless chocolate cake(so rich and decadent), and written around the edge of the plate, in chocolate sauce, was 'Happy Anniversary'...a lovely touch, and so delicious...  a great meal, great service!

Well, it took us 4 trips until we finally found this place open (they're closed on Mondays, and between 2-5pm), but fourth time's the charm, I guess!   I had to dock a star for their lack of samosas and the usual sweet brown sauce I've had at every Indian restaurant I've been to.  I ordered the Aloo Tikki (chickpeas, onions, and potato patties), asking them to leave off the tamarind chutney and replace it with raita(yogurt with mint and cucumber)...it was very flavorful and moist, though a bit spicy(my fault for failing to ask for mild).  I also had the Vegetable Korma--incredible!!!...It was a thick stew of squash, potatoes, peas, corn, and carrots, and it almost tasted pumpkin-y...so savory! The best part was the corn kernels--they were slightly crunchy and added an amazing dimension of texture.  Jamie's meal was the Lamb Masala. We'd been meaning to try lamb again, as the first time we had it(elsewhere), it was chewy and just, not very appetizing. Well--our minds were changed!...this lamb was tender and succulent, and the Masala sauce? incredible!--full of complex flavors and spices...it was amazing!  We also got 2 breads--the Onion Naan (so soft, almost moist in a good way, and FULL of onions), and the Chicken Naan(full of tandoori-cooked chicken, and infused with a smoky, almost barbecue, flavor---wow)...  so. some of the most well-spiced, tastiest Indian food I've had, as well as very friendly and helpful service= 4 stars :)

Unfortunately, I've only ordered from here twice, so I'm not sure if they've changed anything since then.  what I know is that the ginger catfish is superdelectable, and with the rice soaked in the sauce from the fish...mmm...so great! and the owner was quite friendly, as well.

You will NEVER want another burger(or fries, or milkshake) after trying Lenny's...I usually order a double cheese burger with bacon, onions, mustard, mayo, and ketchup, along with a lg. fry(with 2 fry sauces--very important! the special fry sauce tastes like some kind of chipotle remoulade...so delish!), and I LOVE their cinnamon shakes...so different!...  once you've tasted Lenny's food, you won't be able to stomach regular fast food ever again!

So, hubby and I decided to make the most of our $5 coupon received @ the Yelp birthday party, and we hit up Switch a few nights ago.  I did the ordering, and I'd say I did a pretty great job:  We started with the jumbo shrimp cocktail(the cockatail sauce included shredded carrots and finely diced celery, so it tasted wonderful on its own, as well), which came with a small salad drizzled in some sort of citrus-y vinaigrette(couldn't stop eating it, myself :)  I ordered a Greek side salad for him(cucumber, tomato, and onion chunks covered in creamy minty yogurt and some of the richest feta I've ever had)...I ended up stealing most of it LOL...  for my meal, I ordered the Sangria salad: greens, grapes, green apples, and juicy strawberries with toasted almond slivers and that same creamy crumbled feta, all of which was marvelously paired with a sangria-based vinaigrette...  and I ordered the Blueberry Duck for him...not quite as much meat as I'd expected, but the blueberry-port reduction was TO DIE FOR, and mixed beautifully with the potato puree(tasted kind of like a light gravy)...the sauces made the already-tender meat almost melt in my mouth!  with my meal, I had the Vanilla-Peach Italian soda over vodka(the vanilla was far too strong, it tasted as if there was Tuaca in there, or some similar syrupy liqueur, but I quite enjoyed the whole peach in the bottom of the glass :)  on to dessert: he had the chocolate layer cake(very, very rich and decadent frosting), and I ordered the strawberry creme brulee--absolutely mouthwatering! the crust of the brulee was so smoky and sweet, and it paired perfectly with the light, fresh strawberries and the lighter-than-air creme...it was heavenly with a glass of the Juno chardonnay(wonderful honey undertones)  all in all, I'd definitely return to Switch...and this time I'd order the Blueberry Duck for MYSELF :)

we visited SanTan on a very busy afternoon, this past week, and despite the crowds, we received exceptional service all around.  we sat down and immediately ordered our appetizers and first drink(we wanted to get our order in before Happy Hour ended). within 5-6 minutes, our food was on the table, fresh and hot.  we had the pineapple habanero bbq wings(sweet and sticky, with the flavor, but not the heat, of habanero). I'd also requested two extra sides of hot sauce, expecting Frank's Red Hot...nope! I received what can only be assumed to be a house-made hot sauce. it was tangy, spicy(but not unbearable), and chock full of flavor and spices.  we also ordered the house-made cilantro hummus platter...replete with TONS of fresh, delicious beer bread(like pita, but more flavorful), tortilla chips(salty and good), plenty of kalamata olives, cucumbers, and grape tomatoes.  and the soft pretzels(served with nacho cheese and beer mustard) were great! tons of salt, a nice coating of butter, and the mustard was flavorful and delicious.  hubby ordered the special--Bayou Skewers--for his meal. WOW. charred, smoky, herby chicken, tomatoes, pearl onions, peppers, and CORN(omg yum), all skewered and served with a 'cajun aioli'(which was a bit bland...we added some of the aforementioned hot sauce, and that fixed it).  as for the beers...I started with Mr Pineapple(light, fresh, fruity...perfectly refreshing on a hot day), followed by the Nitron IPA(dark, hoppy, a bit bitter, but rich and delicious), and ended with the Gordo Stout(a little watery, but flavorful...chocolatey, coffee flavors).  overall, this was fantastic. our server was attentive(my husband's soda was always full) and friendly, and everything was delicious and prompt. definitely will be returning :)

we've found our official *new* sushi spot, yay!   so...we're in Tolleson now, far from our old haunts of Tempe, Mesa, Ahwatukee. I've been craving some sweet, wonderful uni for ages, and so we did some research(i.e--Yelp-search), and came across Tomo. and, thanks to all of you darling Yelpers, we weren't disappointed =^.^=  the decor at Tomo was lovely; understated, with dark wood, low chairs, and the glow of red lanterns. we sat at the sushi bar, where we were attended to within a couple of minutes. upon receiving the menu, we decided upon miso soup, edamame, and the Salmon Skin Salad, to share. I ordered the uni sashimi, and he had the Monkey Balls and the Ninja roll.  the miso soup was average: delicious, warming, with bits of seaweed, scallions, and tofu. the edamame was a bit of a let-down, however: it wasn't salty enough, and far less than satisfying due to the fact that they used regular table salt, rather than coarse grain/sea salt.  the Salmon Skin Salad($6.95) was enormous! it consisted of a huge mound of lettuce, mixed with cucumbers and glass noodles, drizzled in a slightly-sweet mustard vinaigrette. there were tons of strips of crispy salmon skin surrounding the veggies, all coated in sweet eel sauce...smoky, savory, sweet, spectacular(although slightly greasy).  the Monkey Balls(deep-fried, stuffed mushrooms) were yummy, and spicy, though they seemed a little gamey, or just...too meaty, as an aftertaste.  Jamie's Ninja Roll was fantastic; a huge roll(in diameter), with the perfect blend of sweetness and spice(eel sauce, spicy mayo, Sriracha sauce), surrounding a not-too-spicy deep-fried jalapeno, stuffed with cream cheese. wow.  and now for the piece de resistance: my uni sashimi! it consisted of 6 wonderfully fresh, sweet, delectable slices of sea urchin roe, simply and beautifully presented. always a delight, especially with just a touch of soy sauce to accentuate the inherent dolce tones of the uni itself.  to conclude: the service was attentive, but not overbearing. the ambiance was chill, with a blend of smooth jazz and dance playing in the background, and the food was fantastic; a great mix of tradition and innovation.  we'll definitely be returning to Tomo :)

First off: This is the BEST head shop in the valley.  They have a medium variety of glass pipes(but most are of better craftsmanship and artistry than, say, Trails, or the Paraphenalia Boutique, in Glendale)...and they're better priced, too! (For example, the pink one with a green layer of sparkle in it, that I bought, was $42, when it would have been a good $50 over at Paraphenalia)...  they have an insane variety of incense, with incredible, almost juicy scented sticks...irresistable for someone like me, who likes to keep her apartment smelling delectable(and legal! :)...  they also have a decent stock of clothing(I'm currently wearing a skirt made in India, very flowy and intricately designed. and only $13 :), as well as posters, lava lamps, ash trays, incense burners, stash boxes, odor-eliminating sprays and other household necessities, for reasonable prices :)  the hookah lounge itself is a cluster of tables and chairs with a thoroughly retro theme(shared and authenticated by the entire store), including: adorable 70s kitsch on the walls, classic and original 70s board games(and an old set of dominoes!) and books...and the owner(this *awesome* hippie/'nam vet) really KNOWS how to do hookah, and cares about the quality of the product and the experience...  so, this place is awesome. I'm really glad that we live on this side of the valley now, pretty much because of this place :)

so, having taken leave from Yelp for far too long, I thought Cork would be the perfect entry into reviewing once more :)  Jamie and I went there tonight, seeing as they were serving dinner until 9pm. however, once we'd arrived, Robert(the owner) greeted us and told us that they were in the midst of changing their hours, and that they were no longer going to be open on Mondays. he kindly offered to buy us each a glass of wine/etc. and a plate of cheese for our trouble(driving 20-25 minutes).  moments later, the sous-chef came by and asked us what we 'liked'. neither of us wanted to put him to trouble, especially since they were technically closed. but he said it was no problem at all. in the meantime, Robert brought us a plate of bread with 3 dipping sides: soft herbed butter, an artichoke/lemon oil/olive oil mini-bruschetta, and a balsalmic/olive oil mix, all of which were divine.  we moved to a larger table for the meal, and were absolutely blown away by what the chef presented to us: one plate was the open-faced BLT--shredded, marinated duck breast, seared foie gras, crisp smoky bacon, and sliced duck breast...all atop a thick, butter-soaked, toasted slice of ciabatta, spread with truffle aioli and with 25-year-aged sweet balsalmic on the side.  the other plate consisted of: a small salad of micro-greens and chunks of (nutty) beets tossed in sweet vinaigrette, cold smoked antelope served with a side of sweet balsalmic, beef tartare and almost-crisp onions(in a mound) topped with a poached quail egg, and sea-salt-dusted crisps with a wedge of creamy, buttery brie.  as for the drinks, I started with a glass of Spanish red wine(can't remember which, though the grape varietal started with 'M'--juicy, smooth, with hints of leather). then Robert poured me a glass of Malm(very smooth--hints of lead, but not a strong overtone of it like many wines I've tried--very sweet and easy on the tongue). Jamie had a glass of sauternes...an Australian Somilloun that was very sweet without being saccharine and overwhelming--absolutely addicting :)  throughout the meal, Robert stopped by, showing us the utmost attention and discussing the delicacies we were enjoying.   for dessert, Jamie enjoyed the Banana Creme Pie, laced with dark chocolate sauce and accompanied by baby banana brulee(exceptional!). I had the flight of sorbets(all wine based)--pear, cherry zinfandel, and watermelon--the pear was my favorite, but the watermelon and cherry were splendid together...  so--the end of the meal--Robert didn't charge us for any of our drinks(my 2 glasses of red wine, the 2 glasses of sauternes, and Jamie's dirty martini), and they charged us half-price for our food--not at ALL what we'd expected. I was somewhat embarrassed for putting the staff to test on their night off, but they all went above and beyond anything we've ever experienced--this night was one of the best we've ever experienced, and we'll be back again tomorrow night for half-off-wine-night :)

I honestly CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS PLACE! I could drink their(GIANT) peach margaritas and eat their(warm and wonderful) tortilla chips every single day for the rest of my life :) Their food strays from the typical 'Mexican' fare you usually find out here, and they add their own signature touch--those smoky, spicy, sultry hatch chiles...wow.  Try the margaritas, but be prepared to drink about 12oz--they're enormous :p

I was sorely disappointed by the meager selection at this store, and I'll be driving all the way to the Arrowhead TotalWine from now on, where I can create my own 6-pack of beer, rather than being forced to choose between pre-packed 6-packs or $4-$6 larger bottles of beer. Such a rip-off.

wow, wow, wow. words cannot accurately describe the heavenly experience I had tonight at Noca...  I was convinced to check the place out by Gabi K's review...and I was not disappointed, in the least.  Jamie and I made reservations(pretty necessary at a place where, at 6:00 on a Tuesday evening, it was jam-packed), and were greeted by the chef, who was friendly and accomodating and lead us to a nice half-booth in the back.  we started with the Foie Gras Tarchon(I've been dying to try foie gras since I was a kid watching the British show "Chef" lol)...it was better than anything I'd imagined...melt-in-your-mouth butteriness, a bit salty, and wonderfully creamy when spread on the crunchy-but-soft brioche toastinis...it came with a pineapple jam that was equally divine with the foie gras, and with the brioche...  we also had the Sweetbread Fricassee...the sauteed sweetbread morsels were tender and tasted almost like seafood...it was a delicious dish, but the overlying flavor was of the bacon infused throughout the sweetbread and greens...very good, but a little oily for me.  our server, Robert, suggested the Riesling(tasted like honey and citrus, with a lovely spike on the tip of the tongue) to pair with my foie gras, and my entree--the Day Scallops, and I thanked him heartily for the suggestion.   the Day Scallops were seared, the salt they were seasoned with seemed to showcase the inherent sweetness and butteriness of the scallops themselves...they were so tender and succulent, and perfect with the creamy mushroom risotto and bacon-sauteed broccoli rabe...during this course, I finished my Riesling and tried a glass of the Super Tuscan, a rich red wine that smelled of butter, with plump-fruit flavors, which grew subtly bitterer on the back of the tongue(I finished that wine with several bites of Jamie's tender, juicy Prime Beef Rib-Eye--I'd been craving steak for ages)  for dessert, we had the complimentary(vanilla-infused) cotton candy. the last time I had this lovely confection was 6 years ago, when my Dad took me to the Barnum & Bailey Circus...and maybe my memory serves me wrong, but Noca's may have been the best cotton candy I've ever had...it melts on your tongue in a matter of seconds, and it's impossible to stop eating...  Jamie had the 'Cookies and Milk'--malted vanilla shake with thick, soft, melty chocolate chip cookies(more like blondie brownies filled with chocolate)...I didn't try any, but he loved it.  and...I've been waiting for this part: I ordered the Cheesecake, Dissected(I think that's what it was called)...it may be the BEST dessert I've ever had...maybe even the best dish I've ever had...it consisted of 3 balls of what tasted suspiciously like sweet butter in cheesecake form(each about the size of a large gumball), surrounded by graham/pastry crispy crumbles(sweet, but salty)...the plate was drizzled generously with a lemon creme sauce, and dotted about were pure lime-vanilla gelees(each very small and PACKED with pure tang and flavor)...it was completely decadent, yet deceptively light...an experiment in flavors with every bite, and I will never forget it or get over it...it was heavenly, that's all there is to it. I paired it with the 20-year Tawny Port(simply because I'd never tried port lol)...it was seductively sweet at first taste, but was much too much like bourbon to suit my taste--burned all the way down. luckily it came in a tiny, delicate, stemmed dessert flute)  anyway, bottom line: Noca is a bit pricey, but worth every dollar---the service is friendly and helpful without being patronizing, the atmosphere is boisterous, yet cozy, and the food is...well, the food is to die for. we're heading back for Valentine's Day...making our reservations this week :)

I love Fresh&Easy. I could really just stop right there.  but I won't.  I've loved living across the street from F&E for the past 2 1/2 years, and when I move(soon), I'm going to really miss that proximity.   their prices are insanely good, and they always have a sale section with items of all sorts(produce, bread, prepared meals, etc) for 50-75% off. this is in addition to their 98-cent produce packs, which generally rock my world.  also, their prepared meals(what I've had of them) and pop-in-the-oven-for-10-minutes gourmet-ish breads---all amazing.   add to that the fact that they have 99-cent 0-calorie Vitamin Water and 99-cent tropical trail mix, as well as really great prices(and sales) on beer(with a fairly good variety--always a few interesting, offbeat brews for cheap), and you have a fantastic little market.

This place was the definition of sub-par. Boring food, generic selection, packed and noisy, with pop music(American) playing over the speakers.  First of all, the omissions: no dumplings, no dumpling sauce, no gyoza sauce, no sweet-and-sour sauce/sweet-and-sour chicken, no sesame balls filled with red bean paste, etc  As for what they *did* have? The sesame chicken was tough and overcooked, the egg rolls were disgusting and inedible, and the Kung pao chicken was no where near spicy.  The best that can be said of them was that their cream cheese wontons were good and the service was wonderfully attentive.  Definitely never returning.

Blossom is a great little hole-in-the-wall place to get yummy food and friendly service.  So far, I've only been there three times, but the way they remember their customers, along with their genuine kindness and helpfulness has made an impression upon me.  All three times, I've had takeout. First, the walnut shrimp: breaded, deep fried, juicy shrimp in a rich, creamy sauce, with tons of glazed walnuts and fresh broccoli. The egg rolls are also satisfyingly yummy(nothing special, but good).  Recently, I've been sick, and their wonton soup has been...a blessing. Seriously. A huge container costs around $5, and it's chock-full of savory pork-filled wontons, snap peas, water chestnuts, chicken, shrimp, baby corn, carrots, and onions, all swimming in a delectable broth. Wonderful on a chilly January evening :)

stopped here on a slow Friday night, on a whim I'm glad we acted upon.  we'd driven by earlier in the evening, and I nearly flipped my lid when I saw a classic movie playing on a big screen, in the dining room. I just knew I had to eat here!  we sat inside, since it was chilly out(although they did have a fire pit going on the patio, where many people were drinking).  the menu was expansive, with fair-to-steep prices(but nothing exorbitant). I had the ahi sashimi(exactly what I'd been craving), and we shared the spicy edamame(SO good, though a bit greasy, but for $5 it was an enormous plate--we brought half of it home, and I finished it for lunch the next day). hubby had the jerk chicken(tender and succulent, served with caramelized plantains, amazing 'johnnycakes'--more like savory gingerbread--and rice with pineapple chunks).  best of all? cheap, strong, delicious tiki drinks(and a fantastic, fairly-priced wine list). I had the Zombie--dark rum, pineapple and lime juices. sooo yummy!  and as we ate, we enjoyed 'Donovan's Reef', a Hawai'i-based John Wayne film. yay :D  all in all, a fantastic evening...can't wait to return(hopefully, for Christmas Eve)!

So Jamie and I returned, as planned, for Christmas Eve at Hula's. And, as expected, it was a cozy, perfect evening.  Our server was friendly and helpful, when it came to my quandary over which new tiki drink to try(I settled on a Mai Tai, followed--after the food--by the Hawai'i 5-0. The Mai Tai was delightfully tart, while the 5-0 was fruity and refreshing.). We also got a chance to chat with the owner of Hula's, Dana, who was friendly and personable(also, seemingly the only business owner who actually reads Yelp reviews).  As for food, we shared the whitefish ceviche(a lovely bite from the citrus juices, with a melt-in-your-mouth aspect added by the coconut juice, all accented by the brightness of fresh chopped onions, chili, and cilantro). We also ordered the spicy edamame again--what can I say? I'm addicted! Jamie loved his Cajun burger and totally cleared his plate of fries("they were sooo perfectly crispy"), while I ordered a (giant, $1) bowl of rice.  So, once again, Hula's has left us happy and wanting more!

we FINALLY got around to trying this place. took ages, considering it's right down the road from us, LOL.  anyway, it was super empty(and it always looks super empty), considering what an amazing premise they operate by:  the wall is lined with around 10 froyo machines. you choose the size you want, you fill it as much as you want, and then you move on to the toppings bar, where you top your frozen delight with whatever you want(from fresh fruit, to candies, to sauces, granolas, sprinkles, etc etc etc), and as much as you want.  after that, your cup is weighed and it's time to enjoy!   simple and delightful :D  my only qualm is that they only have 1 non-dairy flavor per week, and they only have 4 non-dairy flavors, total.  (I had Mango Tango sorbet topped with: fresh strawberries, crushed graham crackers, carob chips, mini gummy bears, rainbow sprinkles, and granola--NOMZ! Jamie had chocolate froyo, mixed with mocha, topped with Ghirardelli caramel sauce, chocolate chips, and chocolate sprinkles.)  we'll be heading back here for Double-Punch Tuesday(2 punches per froyo/sorbet, on your 10-punch card), so I can try their Pomegranate Raspberry sorbet :p

The Main Ingredient has quickly become one of our favorite chill-out spots. friendly people, good food, huge portions, good beers.  some highlights:  we usually sit at the bar. I'll order beers(drafts are half off during Happy Hour 3-6pm), and he'll order a Coke(Mexican--bottled). the house olives are fantastic(plenty of fresh garlic, fresh herbs, and citrus zest), as well as the chips and salsa(fairly average chips, but the salsa is incredible).   I've gotten the Red Goat salad twice(greens, TONS of strawberries and pistachios, rich balsamic dressing and an abundance of goat cheese--though, the second time around, I ordered it with gorgonzola dulce).   Hubby has had the Coney(HUGE hot dog on a fantastic bun...delicious all around), and the Cash Money...holy HELL. this sandwich is...SO rich. full of cashew butter(house made), red pepper jelly(made with Cabernet), and banana...it's off the hook, trust me.  in the daytime, it's a fun spot to chill. at night, it's a great blend of romantic(very dim, with candles on every table) and hip. love this place.

So, all I've had here(so far) is one mini carne asada taco, but with that, their friendliness, and their expansive and well-priced menu, I'll definitely be returning.  The taco itself was $1.35, after tax, and consisted of two flour tortillas filled with freshly grilled beef--extremely tender and flavorful, topped with cabbage, raw onions, and a medium salsa. It was a teensy bit greasy, but delicious, savory, and it totally hit the spot!  More to come, soon!

well, I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars for this place.   I've only ever ordered the "UnWich"--a lettuce wrap that I get filled with turkey, avo', sprouts, onions, hot peppers, and cucumbers. it's frigging delicious, with the vinegary peppers adding the perfect zing to the rest of the 'wich.  BUT, and this is a big but--they NEVER get my order right. seriously, I have to watch them assemble this(while they read it off a piece of paper) with hawks' eyes, and remind them that "No, I don't want tomatoes", and "Actually, I ordered cucumber on that". it's a right pain in the arse, to be honest.   to top it off, there's at least one guy there with an attitude problem; I'm not rude when it comes to ordering, but this dude gives me stink-eye every time I have to deal with him. whatev.

I suppose I'm long overdue to write a review of this place, since we've been going here at least once a month for, like, 2 years. I don't even go to the movie theatre anymore--the drive-in is WAY more fun.  things you need to know:   (especially on Fridays, and especially on the opening night of BIG movies) GET THERE EARLY. I'd suggest showing up about 20-25 minutes before your movie starts. this gives you time to wait in the line for the ticket booth, find your screen, find your spot, and run back to the concession stand/bathrooms, if necessary.  bring your own drinks and snacks!  if you come late(or leave early), show some class by turning your headlights off as you drive amongst those already watching the film.  **Tuesdays are half-off!**

well, Sun River...it's just about time to say goodbye. and I can't say I'm that sad about it.  we've lived here for 2.5 years, and the service has deteriorated steadily. the staff is constantly changing, and they have grown ruder and more dismissive with every staff change.  my complaints against Sun River could fill several pages, but I'll stick to the most outrageous offenses against its tenants:  *back in February, while we were out, maintenance entered our apartment with NO notice, NO emergency, and NO permission. they called us AFTER the fact, to let us know what they had done. (to anyone who doesn't know, what they did is ILLEGAL).  *they permanently locked the walk-through gate which leads onto Kyrene Rd(the only way for tenants to easily get across the street, to Fresh&Easy). their excuse? it was 'dangerous', since the gate was constantly open. they refused to replace the lock with a lock which tenants could open with their maintenance key. and guess what? they haven't closed the walk-through gate which leads onto Baseline Rd(on the other side of the complex).  *they now CHARGE $5 per month for parking. f*cking ridiculous.  *tenants are now required to have Renters' Insurance.  *oh, and when we moved in, there was no microwave, and no cable outlet(for, say, internet) in the bedroom. the original office manager authorized a cable extension for the bedroom, which Cox Cable installed. last month, however, the newest office manager informed us that we would need to reroute that cable extension(which runs along the outside wall of the building) through the roof of our building instead. luckily, they weren't stupid enough to pursue this, as we weren't about to pay to have Cox reroute the connection, nor were we about to change the layout of our bedroom, 2 months before our lease ends.  *WORST OF ALL: 2 summers in a row, our A/C has broken. we have cats, and they've suffered because of the poor maintenance. this summer, as our A/C began to lag, we WARNED them that it was breaking, and they refused to fix it("We can't do preventative work; we have to wait until it breaks.") As a result, our electric bill for this past July/August, and LAST July/August have been ASTRONOMICAL. they refused to compensate us more than $100(when they actually owed us around $180), even though we showed them the APS charts documenting the spike in cost/usage, which correlated to the lagging/broken A/C. when it broke, this past summer(late on a sweltering Saturday night), we called the emergency maintenance line and GOT NO RESPONSE. the cats panted, and I slept fitfully on the kitchen floor, while hubby stayed up all night, too hot to sleep. by the time the office opened the next morning, it was 100 degrees in our apartment. we went into the office, and were told that  'the emergency maintenance number had changed'. REALLY? well why, when you call the office, does it direct you to a supposedly-defunct emergency maintenance line?! un-freaking-believable.   in conclusion: Thank GOD we are moving. yes, we're moving to the middle of no where, and I'm going to miss Tempe, but I am so glad to get out of these god-awful apartments.

eh.  first of all, this place had been hyped up to me by a couple of people(hubby included) for several days. add that to the fact that parking on Mill's a b*tch, and you will realize why this was such a let-down for me.  now, we'll begin with the pros: *free peanuts while you wait *delicious cajun fries *malt vinegar  ...that's about it.  the burger was kind of dry and, I suspect, would have been about as good as, say, McDonalds, had I not added my plethora of toppings. the service took forever(and it was nearly empty in there), and their sh*t is EXPENSIVE.  Lenny's, in Glendale, has them beat. hands down.

We trekked up to CBHS today, and we weren't disappointed! The selection was fantastic, and Allen was friendly and patient with us(with our boisterous toddler in tow). They have a great selection of craft beer, plus smokes, and we'll definitely be up that way again!

they have good craft beers on tap. that is literally all they have going for them. it was hardly busy, and it took the bartender nearly 10 minutes just to look at us. the whole concept is great, but this place is disorganized, and the staff are unprofessional and inhospitable. will not return.

Very disappointed! We were in the area, and I had been eager to try Zeta's for the first time. We got there around 3pm, ordered our food to go(had to repeat our order three times, because the girl on the register seemed new). Our food was finally ready around 3:30. As we went to drive away, I looked in the bag and realized my tabbouleh was missing, as well as my husband's Greek fries, and there were no sauces included. We went back, and I told them what was missing. They looked at our receipt and told me they hadn't charged us for Greek fries, despite us repeating the order thrice! They brought out my tabbouleh, which was about a 6oz portion--FOR $6!! I've never paid that much for so little tabbouleh. They then proceeded to charge us for the Greek fries which THEY had forgotten, and tried to charge me $1.25 per 2oz ramekin of tzatziki sauce. Insane. We finally left with all of our food at 3:50pm--nearly an hour after we arrived there! Now, if the food was actually good, this could have possibly been overlooked. Unfortunately, the spicy sausage and kafta kebab were unbearably dry. The pita bread was clearly frozen and reheated. Extremely dry; we speculated that it was even store bought. The cheese pastries(similar to empanadas) had an awful freezer burn flavor to them. The tabbouleh was overly oily. And the saffron rice was also very, very dry.  We will definitely not be returning.

UPDATE:  We returned, today for lunch, at Mahdi(the owner)'s invitation. It was seriously like night and day compared to our first visit! They told us they had gotten rid of a chef, and the proof was in the food. The falafel was perfect, steaming hot, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside; delicious with the tahini sauce. My order of Zeta's chicken(chargrilled on a bed of rice with tangy yogurt sauce) was juicy and delicious, with the lovely smoky flavor of the grill. My husband got some sort of spicy kafta kebab in a tomato sauce, with saffron rice. The sauce on his dish was incredible; building layers of juicy tomato and spices, with an even heat throughout. The meat was nowhere near dry, as it had been last time.  This was a surprising and delightful change from our first visit, and we will certainly return in the future, and recommend the exotic food and gracious service to our friends!

I figure it's about time I review this place, since I've been a regular since it opened!  The salads are around $6, plus $2 if you add a protein. The portions are ENORMOUS, and the toppings are evenly distributed throughout the salad, which is great! There are TONS of toppings, all fresh and bite-sized.  The Asian salad is fantastic, with peanuts, edamame, green onions, and pineapples--terrific if you add shrimp! The Greek salad is delicious, as well, especially with chicken. The seasonal Mediterranean Pasta Salad is AMAZING! While wheat penne, spinach, roasted broccoli and peppers, onions, kalamata olives, and feta cheese. I add a bunch of hot sauce and it's perfect!   Aside from salads, they have a delicious Chicken & Wild Rice Soup, and their various lemonades are fresh and refreshing!   So glad to have healthy fast food options near home/work!

6/17/16  the 2 star review is for the experience I had today. normally, my experience is exemplary, but there were just so many issues today, I had to write this update.  today, a coworker went to Salad and Go and picked up a new Spicy Jalapeno Salad for me. I'd really been looking forward to this. she brought it back to work for me, and there was NO bacon on it, as well as the wrong dressing. I have no transportation to go to Salad and Go and have my salad replaced immediately, so I called them...all I reached was a recording. 4 hours later, when I was finally off work, I had my ride drive me over to Salad and Go, so that I could get my salad replaced. I explained what had happened, and even after explaining, I got a lecture from a supervisor(?) who said, "well, next time, come back immediately". I repeated that I DO NOT HAVE A CAR and therefore had no way to come over there immediately. they asked me what I wanted on my replacement salad and I repeated TWICE that I wanted blue cheese crumbles instead of cotija cheese. what did they give me? cotija cheese. whatever. I had to get home to my son, so I blew it off and went home. when I opened the salad, I found that at least A QUARTER of it was very badly wilted spinach. that was the last straw.  I'm very upset about this visit, but I hope it's a one time thing. I plan on returning(and getting my own food in person only, so I can check that it's exactly what is on the menu, exactly what I order, and FRESH), and I hope they've gotten it together by then. *********************** I figure it's about time I review this place, since I've been a regular since it opened!
