Just found my #2 pizza spot...  I worked the holidays and one of our vendors brought in Stumpys Pepperoni Combo Cheese Hawaiian All were very good, decent crust cooked through and not cardboard :-o// the pepperoni was really good with the extra grease/oil, not over bearing but delicious. I will try their Subs next,,, its a little far from the office, but should be worth a trip to get out.  YAY !!! ITSA GOODA PIE!!

Great Food, Great price, Great Atmosphere...   Had a Large kirin, with 99c appetizer mushrooms.. best fried mushrooms i have had in a long long time.. California Rolls and Alaska Rolls also on this trip.. Very good, and FRESH...  Wife - Teriyaki Chicken,, very good even though all places only sell breast meat on chicken entrees... Portion size was huge comparative to the lunch pricing..  I had the Calamari Jalapeno salad,, lots of Calamari, seriously was more Calamari than salad,, the dressing is unique and matches very well to the dish.  Iced Tea was definitely not china mist or nestle, or lipton,   very good also.  2 appetizers with beer, and 2 full entree's for about 30 bucks out the door.. simply great.... Will definitely be back,, often  Thanks!!

I was thinking old school, best alarm back in the day before viper n all that CRAP...was . Clifford...Well, I went to a few places, and low n behold,,,, they NEVER even heard of Clifford, and,, made me feel like a dumb ass,,,, then they showed me some autopage n viper models for 600+.... OK,,,  I been watching TJ's posts on facebook.. Old school solid work with new and old tech... Called and chatted to him and could tell right away, he knew his stuff,   I finally got the money for my project and had TJ install a Clifford alarm, and remove a junk alarm from my new truck... WAY BELOW shop prices...   After the GREAT service, I now know where i will go to get my "dream" stereo and custom speaker box,,,   Seriously, hard to find GREAT PPL that do great work,,, Thanks TJ  .. Hit me up if you want more info,,,

Safelite cut my valet/command controller,,  needless to say,  they sent out a repair guy who repaired with some trusty ole black electrical tape,  and then some other issues coincidently errored,,  Brought over to TJ n he got it all fixed up working flawlessly...    great work,  will look you up after summer for another install...  great work bro.

I'm usually picky when it comes to pizza.... Most nights $5 is good enough, lil ceasars, quick, cheap and edible,,  But then there's Nellos !! The best pizza i have ever eaten!! I have been in many a country, many a state, and nothing compares yet.. Pizza Bianco ,, naw,, not worth the wait,,   I would recommend this to anyone, and if they didn't like it, i would pay their bill "for close friends who i personally know" don't think this is a free coupon to go there n try hit me up with a refund  hahahaha   The price is a little up there, but we go here for Kids bdays, good grades, special achievements, etc...

I have been coming here for about 7 Years and even show up in February when they shut down for a month for their vacation time.. This place is about the same as Da Vang in Phoenix, which I believe is their sister company..   We go to Phu Thanh about 1 - 2 times a week. Use to be 2 times a week minimum when i worked by the Bank of America tower... Anyways..  This by far is the best Vietnamese place in town and definitely the best value. When you go inside, here and Da Vang, it almost looks more like a gutted house. They keep the environment cheap but clean, which keeps their prices down, -- come on, do you go for the food or social atmosphere? Me the Food....  My Faves and recommendations are listed in order of my preference Combo Fried Rice.. Pho #1 on the menu Seafood Fat Noodle #29 BBQ Pork Short Ribs Served with Rice Spring Rolls Seafood Hot Pot

We have driven by here numerous times and always see a somewhat FULL Parking lot,, We decided to try this place out..   Figured 1. Get pizza, if they can do pizza right,, we come back.. Wife got Egg Plant Parmigiana..   Service Excellent, Wait time for food, Great, not too quick, but not too long.  The Food: Pizza was fresh, and the bottom had a light Crunch which i like.. I often put pizza on a frying pan to get that crunch with left overs.. Not the best pizza by far, but in the top 5 i would say for Chandler..  Egg Plant Parmigiana, Wife loved it, and has ideas on making her own version... Egg Plant isn't really one of my choice plates, so i wont say yay or nay..  Prices were a little high, close to what you would pay at Olive Garden, Red Lobster (not that i go there), or similar places.. for the variety, i will come back, but if i just want pizza, the budget will decide, and for these prices, i will easily go to NELLO's instead..  Great restaurant,... I would recommend but be specific on the expectations.

Finally stopped by here.... ohhhh i miss Sushi Kings in Asia,,, but anyways,, we are in Chandler.  Sushi here was a 3.5 i would say, Nice atmosphere but a little cozy. Staff very polite.  We tried a few different items, and was a little surprised the portion = 2 pieces where most places are min 4.. anyways,, they were very tasty.  We will be back, but since the portions are small, that will double our bill since we would order double up on each item.  Shrimp Tempura was very light n crispy,,,,  Would have like to try the oysters, but either no longer carried or out of season ??   Cya next time..

Great Breakfast spot... Suggest, the Lumberjack  Solid consistent food. Definite improved alternative to going to Dennys or Ihop.. !!(haven't been to either one in a couple years now)   We flop between good egg and waffle house (yes, we get our greasy food on once in awhile)

OK, We finally tried Abuelo's and sat in the restaurant area. Service was excellent, prompt and chips n salsa was better than most places.. Got the Mexican Shrimp cocktail to start... AWESOME , better than my homemade version which is often requested at pot lucks n bbq's... next was the chili relleno's also very very good. Wife had tamales or enchiladas ,,, very good, so good, we wont be going to Macayo's anymore..  Next trip, we just wanted an appetizer, so we sat at the bar. little busy, but wow ,, the happy hour large glass of Kiltlifter $3.50 ... 3 n 4 dollar appetizers ..nuff said,, ,,,   We are going about 2 times a week now, which is a lot for us..   !! best day is Thursday for the Prime Rib..... best prime rib i have ever had so far.... puts any other steak house down when it comes to prime rib... !!  See you there Thursday... We'll be at the bar ordering our couple glasses Draft Beer and the Prime Rib !!

Been almost a year now and have had great experiences and have a few friends that stop by regularly. Appetizers have been consistent the entire time. Prime Rib has been consistently good. Drinks have always been cold.   Service for us is always great, we almost always sit at the bar n the ENTIRE staff are great.  1st Time here i would suggest. Happy Hour  Margaritas or Kiltlifter LARGE Alambre Camarones Pork Carnitas Mexican Shrimp Cocktail (The Acapulco is also very good)  Enjoy and say hi if u see me n the wife there. !!

Use to go to lunch @ the one on Camelback near Biltmore area... Anyways, its been a few years.. like 15 or so :p,,   Tried this place out finally again. Place is VERY clean and friendly staff. I mainly came here for the Flour tortilla chips, but that wasnt on the appetizer menu anymore, so we ventured out anyways..   Fish Tacos with firecracker or dynamite shrimp were friggin AWESOME . The only downer was the ehh tortilla, but all the rest of the ingredients were fabulous.. Got them 2 times so far..   Cheese dip with choriza was pretty good, wish they came with more flour chips thou,, but still VERY good.   Ohhh and the Green Chili MAC n CHEESE was spot on, one the best Mac n Cheeses I have had at a restaurant..  Wife had the soup n Sandwich lunch combo and that was very good also,,, Soup was very flavorable, without the hint of anything canned or frozen..   Went back last week and had those Tacos again and a bowl of Clam Chowder.. WOW, from New England / Boston, I am very picky on Clam Chowder, and this place is probably my 2nd FAVE now for their Clam Chowder.. Great work,,,, Will be coming her few times a month for sure now..  AND TOP IT ALL OFF ...... 20. thats right , 20 Beers on TAP !! including , you guessed it Kiltlifter !

FINE Dining ? that's pathetic.   Golfing at Ocotillo is A+ and my favorite course in AZ..  Played a round of golf on Wednesday and decided to invite the wife over afterwards for some great food "Fine Dining"... big mistale.  Now get you , happy hour prices on drinks are pretty fair... and being Wed and they advertise some prime rib, I decided to give it a shot..  My order, Prime Rib, Baked potato, Asparagus - Prime rib was over done and obviously cooked as a single order. Flavor/seasoned was weak. Honestly, the WORST I have EVER had. Baked potato was cooked decent, but the "fixins" butter for one was like Frozen ROCK hard butter,, dumb,, didn't even come close to melting on my potato,, grrrr,, Asparagus, was also over cooked n limp, very oily with bland flavor..   Wife had Minestrone soup,,, ehhh,   I really love Ocotillo, and put a ton of effort to make the golf trip extra special by including the wife.. Seriously would have had a better time @ Denny's..  don't get me wrong, the scenery is spectacular, water fall and river off the patio, and the atmosphere would be great.. WILL NOT BE back unless I hear they got a new chef or made some drastic changes..   Come here ONLY to Golf and have a couple Happy Hour cocktails.....

After a couple rouds of Golf at McCormick Ranch,, we were hungry for some wings and did a google search for nearby wings n beer type places,,   Zipps popped in as one of the closer locations, but the bad experience at Zipps in Chandler had me second guessing on this place, but decided to give it a shot..   Ordered beer, nice n cold... Food, tried the medium wings,, n I will honestly admit, these are some of the best wings i have had in a long time.. Will definitly be back !!  so good, "I might even give the chandler location one more shot..."

Simple, I think this is the best Vietnamese place in Phoenix... This is mirrored  by Phu Thanh in NW Valley's LeeLee.  Perfect price , great selection, authentic flavors ,,, YES Authentic..   BBQ Pork n Rice, bun xiao, combo fried rice, beef pho, or Bún bò Hu.  are my GOTO items, but i haven't had anything I didn't like except for anything with liver.. no lover for this guy !!   Definitely worth going out of the way to try !!  alternatives NW Phx Phu thanh Thanh, inside LeeLee Chandler Pho Viet Nam -Arizona and Warner

Hit n Miss,,, and this one should have Missed....   Country Ham, definitely left tout too long, and was not very good,, only had 2 bites out of it and determined NO WAY.. Waitress never questioned why I didnt finish it, oh well.. Not saying done on purpose, but none the less, will never be back at this location.   For a Waffle house, they may not be the cleanliest, but they are usually great food at a fraction of the costs.. love these places on road trips !!

1. Front Door Wait for table, hostess was busy and had 3 takeout orders + 3 couples at one time plus answering phone. took us 10 minutes just to get seated in a place that had only 12 seated customers n 20+ tables open.  2. Once seated, the staff, busser, waitress, AWESOME.. they knew the regular peoples names, and weren't over powering asking if everything is ok, just right.   3. Appetizer. Broadway Rolls..  Tasted Fresh shrimp, n crab, but crab was minced, but tasted awesome.. very pleased,  4. PhoTai and Shanghai Rice, Both great.. for Vietnamese Pho, i would rate this 3rd on my list of places to order Pho. Rice, it ranks 2nd.. fresh shrimp, and chicken was cooked, but not overdone and dry,, excellent..   Final say. I will be back. This may be monthly, due to travel distance Chandler to Scottsdale.. If i want Vietnamese, without the extra variety, Da Vang, or Phu thanh. But if i bring some friends, this would be the best place, because of the variety of the cuisine.

OMG is Right,,,  Been "thinking" about going up to try breakfast and finally made it..   The Food is AWESOME, The Huevos Adovada Excellent Soup n Roast Beef Samich - Excellent Breakfast ??? Beer Bread - Kinda like a burrito Excellent Eggs Benedict - Excellent Beer was already know excellent , my Fave is Kiltlifter.  We went with some friends and though parking was a little issue, but once we got that straightened out, the smell of the food was on point... Menu took us awhile as nothing rang out to be the perfect match up,, but let me tell you,,, all 4 of our dishes were on point, I dont normally give anything 5 stars but this place just made the #2 spot of favorite places to eat... The Beer did help with that, but will def be back !!

Not often does any place get the full 5 Star treatment, but after our trip this weekend to Four Peaks,,,  I had to fold...  BEER - Kiltlifter awesome, awesome awesome....   Appetizer - Panko Crusted Calamari - Best Calamri I have ever had.. This isnt the kind of Calamari that you taste only the batter, but nice Strips of Squid that isnt over cooked or chewy, but delicate n the batter is delish as well, but can definitely taste the squid also, and the spicy Marinara was ok, but the Jalepeno ioli or aioli stuff was wonderful as well.  The Lunch - Swiss Mushroom Burger cooked to order /Med Rare - done just right, even asked for extra mushrooms on side (no extra charge).   We have been here a few times for their Sunday Brunch as well, and everything we have tried has been very good.. My Fave is the Breakfast Beer Bread  Enjoy, n post your findings as well !!! Cheers !

WTF, Nellos, move over , you have been outdone.. :-(...   Wife brought home some leftover Sonny Boy, and though this place is in my must try list, and coming off a mediocre experience at Pomo, I finally got my first taste of Pizza Bianco..   Now, I am very very picky as you can tell form most of my reviews, and usually we make the food better than most restaurants, american and asian,, but ok, on to this pizza...   Crust: Awesome, nice texture, not soggy at all, nice consistency, just enough salt, very well cooked... yum,, Sauce: ohh laa, laa,,,Great, this definitely tastes like a lot of flavors going on, and taste fresh, by a very well orchestrated blend of ingredients great job, stay consistent !! Cheese: ok, WTF, what / where is this awesomeness found? I don't think i have ever had great cheese like this before. .. a friend of mine said they make the cheeses fresh daily, but tho i cant confirm as of yet, this has to do something with that,, spectacular..  Now with all 3 of those items above par, much deserving for a 5 star rating.. Now my previous fave Nellos moves to # 2... Next trip to Phoenix, we are going out of our way to try some more of this stuff,,

Came back for a live round and got 2 pizzas, the Sonny Boy and the Wiseguy and they had 4 peaks Sunbru on tap :-) ... Tho the Wiseguy was a very good pizza, the Sonny boy was off the hook delicious. The sauce hmmm lets just say Outfrigginstanding....  Will try a few more choices, but the Sonny Boy is the goto pizza so far... BiancoVerde is on the next order ,, cheers

Gave this place a second try about 8 months ago,,, First time, the baguette was way Too Dry, like a crouton...  Friend of ours catered a party with some of the croissant ham n swiss sandwiches and they were GREAT, and price was very reasonable.  I have been coming back here about once a Week and even get a sandwich for my next day lunch... Still GREAT .....  Glad they are doing good and hope to seem them for a LONG time coming,,,,  Bring CASH or be prepared to use the in store ATM..

1st. OMG they failed a few items on inspection, and fixed them DURING the inspection, Really? Have you ever worked somewhere scrutinized by the county? Anyways, It happens.. Most of you wouldn't eat from my kitchen so piss off.... So get off the bandwagons, and support local businesses.  We come here regularly, and find this place one of the better places in the east valley. My faves are the Calamari, bbq pork, Chinese Broccoli, and the Shumai. Staff has always been great and very hospitable.   This place is also A LOT Cleaner than C-Fu Gourmet...   You pick !

Awesome location, both in Chandler/Mesa border and also the Tempe Location...   1st experience in about 2008 in tempe.. Lil crowded for lunch, but well worth it went a few times, then in 2010 experience Chandler/Mesa Newly opened, great look and roomy even though still packs the place, but what do you expect for the great food. Finally made it back out to the tempe location and WOW, they renovated and definitely more room, and guess what ? yes Crowded still..   I have tried almost every Non-Vegetarian Pasty, and loved them ALL.   Favorites are, Cheese Steak, Steak and cheese, Pepper Steak and the Adovada..   1 That i didn't like was a misplaced order on a very busy day and ended up somehow with shepherds pie pasty,, thinking that all the pasty's are great,, cant go wrong,, but should have known as i don't like any shepherds pie that it may be a bad call to keep it... lesson learned.   Working in area and hitting this place about once a week.  Keep up the great work !!!  OHHHH and the BEER..... great selection,, i suggest the RAJ IPA

Living in the area for 2 years. This past 2 months have received "warnings" regarding parking on landscape (in front of our RV gate - date of said incident had landscaper backed in to trim palm tree) , Unapproved window covering / actually a USMC Curtain on a garage window which dubs as my gym and has been there for over 2 years , and Draining pool in retention area. Letter states to drain pool into the roadway, which Chandler does not allow, and of which, would drain directly into the same exact retention area...   Sent an email as how to advise , any cleaning of erosion from draining pool, that is a locked non public access retention area. Multiple tries to contact with no responses.   Completely unacceptable.

Finally brought the Wife here for lunch. I had the Bulgogi Special. And wife had a Tofu Soup that she loved.. She is usually very picky when it comes to Asian cuisine. We will definitely be back. All the food we have tried so far has been consistent and Very good quality. Prices are a tad bit high, but well worth the quality of food. Each time I have been there, the service is great as well.

Have been here 2 times now...   1st time, I ordered 2 Entrees i thought would be a great gauge to measure their authenticity and style..  Binagoongang - great , fresh,, a little too pungent for me to bring to work and eat in the office, but none the less deliciouso. Ate it in my car in the office parking lot..  Beef Kaldereta - also Great adn the  veggies fresh,, only down side was potatoes easily turned to mush when trying to fork them :P..  Only 3 miles from work will go here weekly..  Last trip Pork Menudo - Meat and flvors awesome,, this time the veggies seemed a little dehydrated, well the carrots.. but that didnt hinder from the dish being great.  Will be back.... Please oh Please add Pork Adobo to the menu or humba ?:P  See you next week at Casa Filipina !! Kain Tayo!

Had some take out pizza last year during holidays... Forgot all about the place but came across it on Yelp,, close to work n try it out.. Went by Friday afternoon, and there was seriously a 30-45 minute wait... Nothing can be worth the wait, so we decided to come back another day,,,,,   Monday early lunch, place about half full..  Ordered the NY Combo -- Once we got our pizza i had a flash back to the pizza we got during holidays,, n BAM,,, this stuff is great pizza... Decent prices..   Not my #1 Pizza place,, but pretty darn close.  Next trip will try the pasta, or the Samiches, as they looked amazingly delish as they went by our table....   Def a Weekly goto place......  Went back and Tried the Cheese Steak Special.... AWESOME... not sure if I can try anything else now that i found the goto item...

WOW... being from New England area "Mass-hole" , i usually am pretty lenient to places since we are "land locked"..  Sourdough bread to start.. hard exterior, did not taste anything close to fresh,, anyways,, looking over the menu, and was a little shocked.. prices higher than "pappadeaux" n thinking the food quality better match..  Appetizer PEI mussels - decent flavor , but 1/3 look over dehydrated, almost as if they were dead way before cooking time. or recooked or something,, those we un-edible.  Wife got the clam chowder which was actually really good..  hence 2 stars  I thought, 22 bucks for some scallops,, hmm, let me try that out.. huge plate came out with these little marble sized scallops, 12 of them.. thats almost 2 dollars a piece for each lil scallop, Side zuchini was ok, but the cole slaw definitely not great,, some bites had that sour weird rubberband taste,,  Waitress, awesome, always smiling, refilling our drinks,,   Finished with a $60 bill,, not even close to satisfied and never going back..  If you want seafood on the east valley, go ahead n hit up red lobster, if you want some great seafood, hit up n. phoenix to pappadeaux(worth the drive and time, will never be dissatisfied)  Lesson Learned. :-(

This is my Favorite Restaurant by FAR. There are a few cons in the past 3 visits though.  Food on one hand is always excellent. Service is usually  really prompt, but if you want optimal service I would eat at the bar.  1. Lobster Sizes. I try to Order 2lbs or So, and every time I have been up-sold to a 3 or 4 pounder without any discount. 2. The Lobster Eat All you Can deal was turning away customers by 7pm on the opening night,, I was showing off and brought 4 guests up from Gilbert, just to get turned away. 3. The Temperature in there is a bit chilly, so if you don't devour your food quickly, it can tend to get a bit cold.  Best Dish Lobster Best Appetizer P.E.I Mussels Best Drink Fat tire  On a nice Date, expect to pay about 80 to 100 per couple..

I returned a week or so after this, and was disappointed. Service was a lot quicker, and after getting back to work, i noticed why when i opened the order.. (Take Out)  1. The previous Fries had a decent batter type fries, where this time it was just regular fries with A LOT of season Salt added.. Too much in some areas and a little in others....  2. Po'boy, thinking it was good last time, and try again,, This time a lil undercooked, and batter inside wasn't done.. :-(  I may go back but it will be maybe 6 months to a year, maybe a new crew?, not worth the risk of consistency..

Stopped out here on a Saturday for their "tour". We brought the kids and baby thinking the tour would be good for the kids, maybe a little hands on activities, well...... ehh  The tour was a 15 Minute history rundown on who and how the place was started and managed, to different types of olive oils / ripeness etc. Then a short walk to a warehouse with a few machines making the actual Olive oil, with a sample at the end..   Now this alone would have received maybe a 2 star review, as it wasn't bad, but also not good.. But hence forth, the actual Olive mill store !!! oh my... Now don't get me wrong, I am not even a fan of Olives, and slightly use olive oil once n awhile, as i know now, i usually don't spend extra money on the better brands (99c store no quality olive oil. lol). They have lots n lots of samples, and even tried some full olive samples,, ehh I know right ? well the Habanero Olive were great, not too strong etc, samples the balsamic variants also pretty good, and some bbq sauces with olive oils in it.. Nice selections, and the prices in the store were good deals. Before we load up on another bottle of EVOO, we will be driving out to Queen Creek for sure..

ok, Tried Sauce in Chandler, n now this one....   Unless you are into over spending for less food just because it may be a little healthier, then have at it.. The flavors have been bland, and leave out of there for about 12 dollars and seriously still hungry....   I tried the Wild Mushroom pizza actually served on a Tortilla :-( lightly dusted with some cheese, ,,, mehhhhh  Meatball Panini, is the only reason for the 2 stars and not 1... it did have some flavor, and the sauce it came with for dipping was decent, i would def try again forl like 6 bucks,,,, Not 10.  Out of rotation ----

Excellent Subs, So far its been consistent for me. The actual store could use some work and decor, but what would I expect out front of a community college.  Lunch Deal is also great. $5 bucks for 8" Sub, chips n Drink... I wouldn't expect more service since, the price is great. If they hired some knowledgeable experiences service staff, they would need to pay more, thus prices going up.. I am totally kewl with the way they are..

So far the food has been consistent, which is one of my peeves.   I have tried the Tempura Appetizer Mango Salad   Bento Boxes for wife,  Chicken Yakisoba for me along with Turo Roll "I Think" Cucumber rolled around rice, yellow tail, n few other items topped with salmon eggs. Delicious, def my fave.  Worth the time n money for sure,,

Pretty solid joint,  with a good variety of seating at bar area or in a dining type area,  usually not too packed..  food has been consistent with good stuuf for kids..beer,  has 4 peaks on draft which is a bonus..  plenty of tvs for sports,  usually every game is on for Sunday's....    my goto is wings,  n sweet potatoe fries.  kids,  either cheese crisp or the nachos..  decent prices overall.

Ohhh my Dayuumm,,,  Ok, wasnt here for a salad, or a burger or come here only for the restroom...,,, I decided on the hmmm a SUB...  Staff were tentative, and "the old guy" making the samiches was genuine..   The Food: The Cuban.. toasted sub wuth Ham, Pork,, yes Pork AND ham in the same samich,, along with crunchy pickles and some mustard spicy or not,,, but wow,, the flavors blended very nicely,...   Price was comparative to the amount of FOOD most definitley.. Will be back,, It will be a coin flip of Sub Factory and this place...  Next trip will be the philly, and if the mushrooms are fresh, then sub factory may have to be archived away...

Not the TOP spot for Thai, but definitly worth the prices.. Great food, good Prices, and very tentative service.. Not the best location, but the food is great. We had the Red Beef Curry, and Pad see ew, bboth were great. Cant wait to go back and try other dishes,. Next will be the drunken noodle.   If my job was close by, this would be a weekly rotation nominee

PL2. Pad See-ew stir-fried flat noodle, egg, broccoli, black sweet soy sauce and your choice of meat  was great... not quite as good as SWADEE but the prices are...  ALSO Weekends do not have LUNCH SPECIAL... Kind of shocked me when i got my bill..   Will definitely be going back.. This could easily be a weekly stop.. (During Lunch Mon-Fri)

I have bought 5 TV's from Best Deal. Definitely the best price for a TV. My Personal selections are LG, Samsung and Sony, but tend to like the quality and price of Samsung a little more.. They do have all the other brands and even cheaper ones like Vizio, Hannspree so you will always stay in your price range one way or another..  Had 1 issue and Called Nick, and he took care of everything ASAP no hassle and straight up Honest Business !!! I don't vouch for many places, but my friends and family will be heading their way on the next TV purchase.

Finally tried this place after seeing it there for 5 years,, Boy have I been missing out,,,  To start off the place was very clean, staff very attentive.. Menu very easy to understand, and the selections of which noodles on every dish is pretty kewl, let alone watching them pull the noodles fresh in the window... Awesome.  We tried the Curry Corn shrimp Noodles wide f

Been up here a few times as it's close to work.. Came with 2 different subsets of coworkers and both loved the deli sandwiches. One group was into the desserts and they said its one of the best they've had...  Deli meats, awesome flavor and very fresh..  Hospitality is above par !!   Great work guys, Keep up the good work, and see you on my next trip up in that area !!

Not sure how long ago they moved but i went to the location on : 3202 South 40th Street, Phoenix, Arizona  * Barg's Red Cream Soda on the fountaiun !!!! Awesome = 1 star * Machaca Chimi / Meat, excellent flavor well shredded with only one huge chunk,, = 1 star * Machaca Chimi Tortilla barely crisped on the outisde only, inside doughy from the meat = 0 star * Machaca Chimi toppings, had a Dusting of cheese :-( = 0 Star * Country Music in a mexican restaurant = -5 stars (minus 5) * order or sit down, not clear on a line process to order or go seat yourself not well orchestrated = 0 stars * CHIPS 1.50 ? Little tray of chips to munch while you wait, seriously 1.50 = 0 Star  If I go back i will try something else, but probably for TAKE OUT, so i dont leave all miserable from the depressing ass country music.   Conveinent, definitely not a place to go anywhere out of your way for. Price was reasonable

3.5 Didnt even know about this place, but had to pick up a pizza at Pizza Hut next door on a holiday since my work address doesnt have a manned lobby for the deilvery guy to deliver,,   Anyways, Tried the PICADO Gyro, the Breading was really good, didnt break apart like other places, The meat (a whole lotta meat too) was consitantly seasoned, and the fixins, were not overpowering.  Close to work, and decently priced I will definitly be back.  Even the fries were good....

3.5 - Love the new digs.. nice tables and ambiance.   Wife got lamb curry @ 2 spice levels,,, was mild but a whole lotta flavor I got the Shrimp Vindaloo @ 5 spice levels... heat,, mm heat,,,  very flavorful as well, sauce was awesome to dip the garlic bread in,   not a huge fan of basmati rice though,,, with you had choice of Jasmine,, but all in all we will be back,,  thanks,  FYI: Front door isn't just a pull on handle, you need to press the top lever then pull, almost seemed like the place was closed...

In Fear of new Mexican places and running to the bathroom 30-45 minutes after a Meal, I was hesitant to try out Jesters,, I was driving by and thought a "GOOD" chicken Quesadilla would suffice for lunch...   On Entry, this place is immaculately CLEAN, seriously.. Nice Job. I arrived a tad early, 10:40 as they were still setting up for the day.   When I Ordered, I was told the chicken wasn't ready yet, but other options available,, grr, but then one option was Red Chili Beef... Hmm, ok, since the Tamales i got on Christmas SUCKED, I could use a good fix of Red Chili Meat... SO got that to go..   Red Chili Beef Quesadilla. Preparation, consistent as they prepare in front of you, Flavors on the meat, Juicy, Tender, n flavorful.. Wow,, don't think I will EVER get the chicken version again.. The guy running the show was VERY courteous, and polite.   Will be back there SOON to try more options,, Great first impression guys !!  FYI: 45 min later, no urge to run to the nearest bathroom... A++

I miss CHUY's on Sunday afternoon..... So, we tried the new digs at La Fonda. Just maybe there was a Make your own Bloody Mary special (nope).. ok, new design, looked a LOT more formal and more like a restaurant than a bar.. We sat at the bar to test the food and have a couple drinks.  I got an Amber Dos Equis .... Clean, cold glass oh yea.... but then the after taste had a strong metallic hint to it.  Got Sampler appetizer, BEEF.. Taco, Taquito, Chimi... all 3 the meat was short on flavors, had to scoop in the salsa to get something going on.. Chimi didnt have that chimi crunch. .. one of the bartenders that came on shift while we were there did nothing but complain about her scheduled hours and being asked to come in to other customers... :-(   Will not be back, cant get shredded beef right, why try anything else..  ++ the chips were good, salsa  eh,,,

Ok, Tired of Subway, very very tired...   New Sub place across from my fave grocery store LeeLee,,, anyways,, went into SideWinder, and there was one other customer..   Checked out the menu, and then stood there,, seemed like about 5-8 minutes before I was asked if i knew what i wanted to order.. REALLY ? no warm greeting, good am, afternoon, let us know when you are ready,, and yes, the other customer was already at a table with his sub,, After the fail in greeting and hospitality, I ordered and decided for TAKE OUT.. definitely no sense of urgency form the 2 working here and got my sub and drove 2 miles home.. Home, unwrap the samich, and the bread is totally SOGGY, and not from mayo or oil, but from sitting in water like soggy,, yuck, 1/2 the samich was no good,, there is no way that they didnt notice when making the samich..   If Lees sandwich took Credit Cards i would go there from now on,, but looks like i may need to drive a little further. !!

@ Food Truck Festival Feb 22...  Tried a few of the different Food Trucks, and though not a full beleiver and probably wouldnt chase any truck around town, I would definitly buy from these guys again, if they happened to be at a local area that i was at..   Tried Dumplings, and they were bettter than any local restaurant.  Imperial Chicken, had great flavor, but would be better on a full piece of chicken, like aq drumstick, thigh, or wing or on wings themselves,, 4 piece meal or somehting..   Will buy again , but will no travel to chase them down..  Service and hospitality #1 the guy greeting everyone was very nice and energetic, remembering most customer names when we went back to drop our votes !! Great work guys !!

Nice little gem right here. I am usually never ever in this area, but we happened to have a team lunch here and one of the team members suggested it..   Nice littel brewery, with a little asian/filipino theme for food selections. Lumpia .... yumm,,,  ok, Staff were very nice and tentative, I sampled the Octomalt  not too bad a little dry tasting, but decent.. Then I had the Spiral Man a dark oatmeal stout,, yumm, very smooth, could definitly drink a few of these, then close off the drinks, i tried the Baby Belgian, aslo very well flavored nice and mellow..   Food: Asian Sliders, great flavor, and the fried onion strings added a good taste, but the dinner roll /bun as a little on the small / soggy quick side, I am not a huge fan of the pretzel buns since "everyone" uses em now, but over all Was very good..   I would drive a little out of my way to hit this place up.. Friday afternoon lunch.,not over crowded, tables are spaced out so not bumping into people,, Great job guys ,, mabuhay !!

Tried out this place today, as I  have been looking for something close to work.. I have a few places in Phoenix area that I trust but a lil too far. (Pho Viet Nam - Chandler // Da Vang - Phoenix // Phu Thanh - N Phoenix inside LeeLee)   Pho Viet, after reviewing the posts. we gave it a shot.  please note: _ Place VERY clean, tables chairs, floor etc - which shouldn't go much towards the #1 issue, the food. _ Waiter/s - Polite and hospitable  _ Menu - A lot of options, wheew weeee _ Price - Average - please recognize fresh veggies in your dish, not frozen,,   On to my review of the Food !!  # 47  - Mi Xao Don Thap Cam (bird nest) Stir-fried crunchy egg noodle with beef, shrimp, chicken and vegetables.  Veggies, Fresh and al dente good job.  Meats, well seasoned, (tad bit dry) Shrimp lil over cooked. Noodles, great flavor and nice crunch, and awesome in the broth. Broth , was very good, and worked great with the noodles.  _________________________________________________________ coworker tried #103 - Bun Tom, Thit Nuong, Cha Gio Rice vermicelli with grilled shrimp, chicken, and egg roll served with lettuce, cucumbers, bean sprouts, peanuts, and a side of lime chili fish sauce.  Coworker states,  Not the "best" ever, but definitely the best he's had in AZ  1st Time but not the Last... This place is pretty good, will be here more often and sample more dishes. Will update on the next round..  PS. Don't read into posters who only have minimal posts either haters, or don't really know food, as you should always post the good and the bad experiences for full circle of opinions and to judge the posters values. Users with only one post and being negative should be removed from yelp... just saying.

2nd Trip here to catch the Bruins Game vs Detroit 4/26/2014   Brought the Wife and some other friends, and everyone had a GREAT time. One my friends brought their Kids and even the kids, loved checking out all the birds... Even the crazy one that BITES...   Beers - Awesome Food - The Smoked , Mushroom and Onion cheeseburger      Not sure if the Wife or her friend ordered, but it was well done. I would have chosen medium, but it was still delicious :-o  Pooch's Perch Pepperoni      Bread, Beer Bread dough,, OH MY,,, Awesome, The Sauce,, Awesome, and a Ton of cheese, and like gourmet pepperonis, or something,, This pizza was off the hook Delish.  Food Price is a little High, but you ARE getting some great FOOD... Beer prices are average.  Will be back most definitely

Pho Viet Nam Finally another Vietnamese place.. Opened today..11/1/2013...  Our favorite place moved, (phu thahn) so we have been waiting for something great without traveling far.... We got lucky, cause this place is it...  appetizer. Fried egg rolls.. Hard to admit, but these are the best i have had at any restaurant.. Spring rolls up next, and they were also very good, they didnt have that overpowering of mint so that was actually very good.. Both dipping sauces were a very good compliment as well..  entree. Wife had beef pho, and this actually beat our phoenix fave (da vang)... Awesome.. I had bbq pork, and was very good as well.. Only downside was that i am not a fan of broken rice, but that is minimal...,,,  now it will be whether they stay consistent.. But this will be a definite weekly stop until otherwise..  also since they just opened the menu isn't full yet.... I have some suggestions,see if they add them...

Have been here about once a week give or take, and the food has been very consistent. The pho soup base improved a bit, but it was already better than everywhere else. I have been here when it was slow and very busy and even then, the service has been very good. Glad to have this place in Chandler..  Pho Viet Nam, staff n Crew... Keep up the great work..

OK, now, me n my buddies make some good ribs, chicken, etc and dont really like going to Rudy's, Famous Daves , etc since its Ehh ok.. Pork on a fork, ehh,, ok, no work n no cleanup i guess... But me n my coworker hit Lil Miss Tuesday, got there 30 min before they opened, n took about 30 more minutes after opening to get our order in. My initial thoughts, get ribs, pulled pork and brisket.. samples were being handed out before we got to the ordering, i reduced my order n only got a 1/2 b of ribs n pulled pork n got a full pound of brisket... mixed half fatty, etc,, omg !!! dude this place HANDS down best in AZ so far.. Some other patrons said its a spitting replica of Franklins,, whatever that is. lol.. but yes ,, worth the wait.   Brisket, oh so delicious, juicy, awesome smoke flavor, no dry areas, and none of it was slimy even the fatty area.. WOW, thats how its done right there...   Ribs,, pretty darn good, n better than most places, Angry crab has decent ribs also, both better than famous daves.. pulled pork,, ? ehh, My wife makes some bomb pulled pork with an asian twist,,   Next trip 2 lbs Brisket..   Beware of parking if you dont get there early, Bring a copilot to get in line n wait while you wait to park.. .

Pretty decent place right here. #1 item is their choices of Condiments/sauces.   I got an Shroom burger, was cooked decent, good fixins fresh buns... Not over the top, but a tad better than most places.   Wife got a Chili dog, .. Was overboard, but she loved it as well.   Got 1/2 basket Fries 1/2 Sweet Potato fries, decent size n texture,  Tried almost all the sauces, and we tore up the Chipotle somethign sauce,, Chipotle n mayo? dunno, but was very good... yummm, Got a few other burger shops to try, to see which is the new go to place..

Stopped by here a couple months ago, and didnt see my review ? oh well,, been there 3 times now,,   Always great service, Burgers have been cooked to order, and tasty, Wife usually gets the Coney dog, or something like that, which is pretty good, just not a hot dog fan...   GREAT selection of beverages.. AMEN...  Great place to stop after a morning of golf,  Plenty of TVs to catch sports, not too loud, and has outdoor seating for the smokers, or peeps with pets..

For Chinese Buffet Style, this is the mirror image of Pacific seafood Buffet.. Which is one of the Top places for Rural Phoenix area... Now don't get me wrong, its still buffet food, but better than most places !!  We sample most of the different food every time. My main time to go is Dinner to make sure i get some Snow Crab legs.. They get a better variant n cleaner Crab legs than other Buffets I have been to. I get a few plates of crab legs to suffice the $$ for Dining. This location is also A LOT cleaner than the Sister Pacific location as well.   The Owners and Management are also very nice people, and love to listen to constructive criticism if you have any..   Don't forget to try the coconut macaroons,, Yum !!

Fan of the mesa location so tried this one expecting not as long of a wait... 1st time was packed n waited about 40 min, not too bad, been back 3 more times... tells ya something right there alone.   This place has excellent BBQ / I would rather come here than Famous Daves, ok... Wife always gets the combo Ribs n Oysters, which are great, they offer a couple different sauces for the ribs, and I enjoyed both, tho they sometimes charge you for the extra sauce... Act like you dont know which is which n "sample" both, then usually left off the bill...   Heat meter warning..... 1-5 from the Mesa location does not hold the same scale-ability here as each time I ordered, it came out a lil over my expectation. Usually in Mesa I get 3, n this places 3 was a tad too hot both time, as thought 1 time might be an error, then last time we went a couple weeks ago, I got the 2, and it was still pretty hot...   My fave is 1lb Shrimp, Trifecta 3-mesa  / Trifecta -1 here next time maybe...  Kids love the mussels, garlic flavor No heat Wife , Ribs n oyster Combo  Now the best part of this place is the price. For a pound of Raw shrimp in the store, your looking at 10-12bucks per pound... same price as this place hooked up with sauce, n no cleanup. :-)   See you there on our next seafood craving... Almost n extra * for having 4 peaks on tap,,,

ok,  not quite pizza bianco,  but not fired pie either..  Cafeteria style pizza creating,  at one price per size and not per topping...   sauces: bbq,  white, regular,  pesto or garlic.   cheeses: mozzerela,  feta,  asiago,  gorginzola,   meats n vegies looked fresh,  mosr grilled/roasted.   MOD size,  i got pesto n garlic for sauce,  mizzarela cheese,  chirizo n bacon for meat,  mushroom,  onion n banana peppers veggies,  add asiago..   will be back.  often.  customer service was very good,  very nice n cheery without any fakeness..  congrats.

Braised pork belly appetizer was awesome..  lil small portion  size but ohh so tasty..   spicy miso ramen.  great flavor,  n just the right amount of heat..  the egg wa lil runny in inside,  perfection.  best ramen i have had in long time.   tonkatsu ramen,  also great flavor close to yakisoba flavor,  egg same runny,  we will be back soon..   place closes from 3 till 5, as we learned hard way.  seating is a little cramped,  but well worth it for the food.  chefs and wait staff very friendly.. great job..

ok, 3.5 Stars,, 4 for the staff explaining everything,,  Tried both Chicken and the Beef BBQ options and both were good,, def not the BEST ever, but better than most other places. If you're craving Hawaiian and in the area, then its worth it !! Right down the street from me, so we will stop by once in awhile for sure... I like it better than Aloha on Alms N Guadalupe... so,, take it as you prefer. !!

Trying out the new place..    small salad,  spicy tonkatsu ramen  n chicken karaage...   Chicken karaage was pretty great.   Spicy tonkatsu,  pork, egg,  onion,  miso n chili,  noodles cooked perfect,  salad was normal asian style..   Technical difficulties from opening so they turned some ppl away..  I hope those people return later n give this place a shot..   Will be back..

2nd Round here..   They reduced the menu option by a lot..  Making it simple so they can grow and evolve into their original expectations.   Nishikawa Ramen.  great flavor again similar to the Tonkatsu with few extra ingredients..  added chili that they have on tables now,  not sure if experimental or long term,  looked lime fresh ground thai chili..  nice uplift to soup that was pretty good already..  (eggs overcooked a lil,  yoke not soft n runny,  but i saw a negative post someone saying its raw that way..  whatever)  next time will ask for a raw'er egg that has a runny yoke.   Wife got Chashu Don..  we were hoping this was more like Kakuni,  but it wasnt.  Flavor was still good,  rice cooked good,    Good job correcting the issues.. Staff way more attentive..  keep it up n hope you guys stick around..   goto dish so far,  Spicy Tinkatsu n side Karaage..
