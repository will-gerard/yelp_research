Weekly wine tastings and art/music shows??? What's not to like? And the fact it is in a hidden away (but yet no so secret) basement makes this place full of character and curiousity.  I have gone to craft shows and wine tastings and felt like the intimate space was purely a gathering of friends inside someone's house. the wine selection to me is that of a book worm in a library, I could spend hours down there reading the bottles.  Like them on facebook, check out the website. The character and ambience of the place is refreshing and conversations are always stimulating.

My friend introduced me to this place and now I'm hooked. I have always done my own pedicures and manicures, but after my friend convinced me its more about the service than the end product, I decided to go. See, I'm a girly girl, but I am also frugal. I have spent hours giving myself the beauty treatment that will look like a pro, but I have never considered the service alone is why people go to the pros. Being I have a vested interest in Service-Centered business (thus the Marketing degree), I should also practice what I preach.  We went on a friday afternoon, around 2ish and there was no wait. Water in the pedi chair was perfection. They took the time to be thorough and never rushed when customers started coming in and the became a wait. Every customer was treated like the only customer.  The second time I went, same time of day, etc, there was a slight wait, but that gave me the chance to chat and catch up with a friend. My person gave me suggestions for my mani/pedi and it was ideas I never considered. She was so thoughtful. My mani lasted about 2 weeks and my pedi is still going strong.   I am going to try to make this a part of my routine, a little treat for myself, every payday :)

I have been a member for almost 2 years and never had a problem with finding a group x class to fit my schedule or experienced over crowding in the main area.   However, times have changed in the past 4 months. Zumba classes are becoming over-crowded. It is maxed out way over the building fire code and they don't enforce it. If you are in line early, it doesn't matter. You will get pushed back into the corner as people arrive late and crowd up the space. There are no ceiling fans and it gets hot and very humid and thick. They need to add more classes or enforce the "limited space" and do first come, first serve. I don't pay a membership to not be able to access all the features and not get an effective workout.  I left class early today because I had no where to move, I was bumping into people, couldn't see the instructor, and was feeling a heat stroke coming on, though I was properly hydrating myself. It was torture, not fun like it use to be. I wasn't even at the class that was at the busiest time of day!  The other day my friend had to leave because they were short staffed and the Kids Club was filled up. If it is during Zumba, you can guarantee it's going to be busy for kids too. They should have staffed the area properly.  I feel my money would be best suited at a private studio rather than a gym.

I'm so glad there is finally a place to go in the East Valley that has the energy and vibe of a downtown Phoenix club. The best part is, it is literally steps away from the Sycamore lightrail stop (last stop on the line).  They just started 2-4-1 on Thursdays and considering my summer work hours are Mon-Thu, this is going to be my Thursday night spot.  The Happy Hours prices are fantastic. Heck, their normal hour prices are fantastic! Happy Hour is everyday from 3 - 7PM and again Sun - Wed 10PM to Close. Most places have cut their happy hours from 4 - 6PM so how refreshing that I can still make it to a happy hour after work. They offer $2 small plates, which is the perfect size for me (I have a Lap-Band), but also gives customers the chance to taste a variety of the menu. Drinks specials range from $1 off drafts and bottles (reg $3-$4), $1 off wells, $2 off wine (reg $5-$8) and $8 off bottled wine (reg $18-$30). Plus they have all day weekly specials. Everything can be found on their website.  Food is great and kitchen is open until 10PM on weekdays. I had the roasted poblano hummus and their green garlic fries. Very addictive! My friends sampled the wrap, chicken avocado club sandwich, and the blackened ahi burger.  The bar has almost every vodka and flavor imaginable, thus their extensive and unique martini selection. The staff is personable and by the second time you visit, they will probably remember your name and anything you talked about at your last visit.  The interior is modern with touches of leather and steel. The colors are my personal favorite: black, red, and white. There are 3 VIP/loung areas, a dance floor, and DJ booth. The bar is this incredible layered and intricute colors of biege, black and silver granite. The place is just stunning and you feel like you're in Scottsdale or Phoenix.  The Grand Opening last weekend was packed and I truly hope every person returns. I am elated that this establishment has chosen my neighborhood and my type of friends to be of service to. Stop in, introduce yourself to the staff, and make this place your regular.

I am obsessed about whether or not I can ride my bike to go hang out with friends. This is my "hop on the bike and go" place. There's pool tables, delectable wings and pulled pork sandwiches, and a billion TV's. My favorite bartender is Nikki.  Friday nights at Riverview is Bike Night and Cactus Moon is in the middle of it all. Have a drink on their patio while listening to live music and admiring motorcycles, or drive your own and put it on display.  You can bring your kids if you like, but realize Friday nights are Ladies Night, so leave the kiddos home on that night. I love this place to watch sports and meet up with friends.
