I love this place.  My hair and nails always come out fab. They always help  and have time when I have questions and need an expert opinion.  They never make me feel like I'm asking a stupid question. I always have a great experience.

I scheduled an appointment a few days ago when I got there they told me they didn't have time to do my oil change.  They said they had a few people call out and suggested I go to another Brakes Plus (over 10 miles away) that could POSSIBLY get me in or come back at 4pm so my car can POSSIBLY get done by close at 6pm. I don't schedule appointments to be given a possiblity of it being done.  I expect a reasonable time frame for a simple oil change.  I understand that people call out of work but they could have called me before my appointment time so I didn't have to drive over there and waste my time.  Besides that he was very rude and began to walk away after telling me to come back or schedule at a different location.  Very disrespectful and I will never go back again. I will be telling everyone I can about this.
