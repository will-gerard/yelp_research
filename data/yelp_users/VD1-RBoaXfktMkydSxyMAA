Finding good Indian food in Phoenix has made the move here easier...especially a place that's a mile from my house.  Parking is easy Service is always fantastic Take-out is always ready very quickly and very hot Good variety of spices at the attached little store  Tried and recommend: Shahi paneer, chicken tikka masala, veg korma. chana masala Might revisit but not thrilled with initially: saag paneer, aloo gobi  If you like spicy (or not), tell them--they go kinda easy on the hotness unless you specifically ask (use the 1-10 scale)  I wish it was a little less formal feeling inside, but I typically do take-out so not a big deal--it just makes for a date-ish environment rather than a group o' friends environment.  Again, not a bad thing, i'm just sayin'. I've also never checked out the lunch buffet so maybe the white tablecloths and preset water glasses are a PM thing.   [p.s. i'm now officially amused that i just said i wished a place was less nice. don't really hear that too often...]

Decent sushi (taking into consideration that this is AZ) but service and parking were horrible.  Waited 15 minutes to get any type of recognition from our waitress.  We ordered appetizers and various rolls and nigiri pieces.  The sushi came out before the appetizers.   When the appetizers did arrive they were a disappointment.  Well, I take half of that back, the edamame was good (hard to screw up) but the calamari was 1. weird it wasn't traditional calamari but long breaded and fried planks of calamari 2. gross.  It seriously tasted like it came out of a Gordon's frozen box.  Almost like a really bad, huge fishstick.   Anyhow, like I said, the sushi was good.  We had the dragon roll, unagi, spicy tuna roll, yellow tail and an avocado roll.  Warning: The spicy tuna roll will kick your ass.  It was really spicy.  Really, really spicy.    Non-food observations: No wait for sushi, but I guess there was like a 20-30 minute wait for the steak portion of this place.  The decor was fine.  Industrial-ish building/floors and an aquarium behind the sushi bar (I didn't get to see the area in back which I am guessing is the grill area the other review talked about).  Parking was HORRIBLE.  They've got this weird half circle parking lot that doesn't have any kind of escape back in the corners so if you go back there and there isn't a space you have to make a 12 point turn to get out.  Drove around in the parking lot for 10 minutes looking/waiting for a spot.  It doesn't really help that people in Arizona are notoriously bad at taking forever to pull out of their spots...

Although I feel bad for having to say it, because the owner is really nice, this place is pretty underwhelming.    The decor is nice, albeit a bit generic, but the service, food and drinks are less than mediocre.  Starting with service: admittedly the place has only been open a couple months, but the waitress (really young girl) seemed to be more concerned with checking out the busboy than serving.  Had to ask for a water 3 times when she kept returning to the table without it, she told us one of the sauces was a vegetarian brown sauce--but when we asked the owner (who brought out the food) she said it was a red sauce with meat.  The drinks at the bar were REALLY weak, but priced pretty decently and the food was pretty good.  Based solely on food, they probably would have gotten 3.5 stars, but service and drinks brought it down to 2.  The chicken marsala was good, but skip the spaghetti that comes with it, try for a different side because the sauce tasted really old.  Word on the street is the Greek side of the menu is much better than the Italian, unfortunately I went with the latter.  Perhaps, as with most new restaurants, with time and fine tuning things will get better.  Let's hope so.

Well hello, Yelp, long time no see.  I'm back now but in a different city and I'll try to get back in the swing of things. So here goes...first review in Phoenix: The Breadfruit.  - - -   The owner of the Breadfruit can tell you where the strawberries they use in their fresh made strawberry lemonade come from. And the answer isn't Costco.    I went in at kind of an odd time, 4:30 on a Saturday, after a day of apartment hunting downtown.  There was a duo and another solo diner both sitting inside. The server was friendly and offered great suggestions. The weather was perfect so I sat outside at one of the handful of tables on the sidewalk.  The curried chicken and dumpling were fantastic: served with grilled plantains that tastes more like a potato than fruit,  and fresh bell peppers. The dumpling was dense and went great with the curry sauce. Although the rice and peas that the server suggested were delicious, I think the entr√©e could have stood on its own.  The server picked up on the fact that I was in no rush and she was friendly and attentive while not rushing me. A while later a guy who worked there came outside to eat his meal before the dinner crowd arrived.  We started talking about the book I was reading, Food Inc, and he told me about the restaurant's goals to provide thoughtful, local food. Turns out I was talking to Duane, the owner, and I was pleasantly surprised to hear him tell me the strawberries in my strawberry lemonade come from the farmer's market around the corner and were grown in Yuma. There aren't nearly enough business owners who care enough to invest the time and energy into such pursuits. We talked a little more about our common love for conscious eating and how meals should be experiences, not quick fixes to fill you up.  He explained that this is why his restaurant does not package anything to go. I can respect that. If you want their food you're going to eat it fresh and you're sure as hell not taking it home to microwave leftovers.  A chef/businessman with values who eats his own meals, talks passionately about being involved in the growth of downtown and can tell you where his food comes from...I'm a fan.  Did I mention the Sweet Potato Pudd'n and vanilla ice cream? Uh.Maze.Ing.

Excited to have found a great salon in my neighborhood here in phx. The first year and a half after I moved here I waited for trips back to SF in order to get my hair done, but now that I've found this place a hair appointment no longer involves a plane.  I've gotten great cuts (with Morgan) that had a lot of body to them and grew out well. She was also super helpful when I was indecisive about color helped me decide on something that matched my skin tone really well & that I've gotten tons of compliments on. Loved the Morroccan Oil they used in my hair there so much that now I use it after every wash.  So far I've only had hair appointments here but heard they started doing gel nails too and because when I paint my own nails it looks like an epileptic 7 year old on a bender took a whack at it I am looking forward to trying this there too (word on the street is they've got a ton of color

Pros: + Design inside the restaurant + Patio: fire pit, water wall, umbrellas, heaters + Brunch served 'til 4pm on weekends  Cons - Coffee is badbadbad - Inconsistent food quality - Super pulpy mimosas (maybe a 'pro' for pulp lovers? Their opinions don't count though; who likes pulp?)  Getting out of bed after most places had stopped serving brunch two days in a row led to two consecutive brunches at Province last weekend. Which was good because now I know that it wasn't just one off day they had on Saturday, but that it's a genuinely mediocre brunch option.  Coffee that was served was cold the first visit, burnt and bitter the second. Being poured the bottom of the pitcher led to grounds floating in my mug. Whatev, it happens. But the server not saying anything--or fixing it--was disappointing.  Mushroom/goat cheese omelet was fine. Actually, pretty good. Dressing on the side salad was great & the tomatoes were super fresh (salad was better than the omelet). Benedict on visit 2 was really, really disappointing. English Muffins used as the base were great but that's where the positives end. The sauce was too thick, had very little flavor and there was way too much of it.   Over-cooked poached eggs really piss me off. As a cook or a server it's painfully obvious when eggs are overdone. No jiggle? Don't serve them. Sadly, two completely solid eggs were put on my plate. Cut into them, took the solid top off like a lid to show the completely solid center and pushed them aside on the plate. Again, server said nothing.  He got the pancakes on visit #1 and chorizo tacos on #2. Plate was cleaned both times, so they couldn't have been that bad. It's possible I'd go back, but only on a beautiful day to enjoy the patio and possibly try the mini churros.

The bathrooms are really boring.   That's literally the only less-than-fantastic thing I could come up with. Everything else is spot on: Medium-sized space that feels intimate but not cramped; great sound equipment; stage is the perfect height; bleachers in the back of the room; 2 bars run by friendly people & phenomenal food.  If you haven't been: check out their calendar and try to make it in soon. Or if you'd rather just grab a bite and skip the show, you can go into the front section ("The Lounge") and just eat and have a drink without buying a ticket. I recommend the nachos.
