This is a "must see" for those new to the desert.  They have a world renowned collection of desert plants & rare cacti all set in a stunning location.  See natural landscaping as well as what can be done with succulents in a planned landscape.  Excellent!

This resort makes me feel like I have died and gone to heaven.  I didn't want to ever leave.  The pool area is so lovely and quiet is feels like a sanctuary -not at all like the noisy pools at most resorts.  And then there is the restaurant, T.Cooks, which is amazing!  An outstanding menu by a talented chef and the ambiance of dining in a Mediterranean villa.  Staying here is a real treat!

I always use PreFlight for my airport parking.  They are fast and reliable with safe facilities - in the shade or not, your choice.

Great for groups with live entertainment and wholesome food. They can handle huge groups and do a wonderful job with a chuck wagon meny. Also a fun place to take out of town guests with kids.

This is by far the most professional irrigation company in the Valley.  We have been using Think Green to repair our aging irrigation system and they quickly find the source of the problem and fix it like new.  They also installed new landscaping lighting for us.  The best!!

The worst service ever!  Just one degree below the food- which was horrible. The wait staff is untrained & the food is cafeteria quality.

We thoroughly enjoyed our hot air balloon ride with this company.  Very professional, very safe but friendly and informative staff.

You need to understand that the owners are French. Once you compliment them, then you get great service. ") People, stop putting down a restaurant that serves great food just because you think the owners are uppity.  If they offer a dish and don't mention the price, ASK!  Don't blame the establishment.

Absolutely delicious crepes! In addition, it is quiet enough that you can actually have a conversation over a leisurely lunch.  Very authentic French cuisine in a small cafe with nice patio seating.

A unique setting with great BBQ at a great price. Pulled pork,  brisket, chicken and more. I thoroughly enjoyed the smoked chicken salad and iced tea. Very tasty.

Really?  The only Pinot Grigio available is Santa Margarita @ $12/glass!  I'm not a beer drinker and since this is a sports bar, I expected a quaffable white wine at a reasonable price. PLUS the waitress didn't tell us about the limited selection and high price.  To me this is an easy fix if they want to attract more women.

Great mussels, which is their specialty. Nice little restaurant for an intimate dinner that isn't dressy and all about the food!

I love going to Pluma - I put my head in Hilda's skilled hands and totally relax.  It really is a "Woohoo - as good as it gets!" experience.  Hilda and her team work seamlessly together.  The color is always perfect and haircut always done with style and pizzazz.  Can't say enough...

I was so looking forward to the octopus dish after reading the reviews, but my dish was a big disappointment.  The chef had charred the fish to a crisp so that it was tough and the tips inedible. The grilled cheese sandwiches were black as well. Service let us down too because our poor waitress was the only staff waiting on the entire restaurant and patio for lunch.  She tried her best, but they really needed another person during the lunch hour.  And how do they get away with charging $45 for a bottle of Prosecco? Over-cooked and over-priced.

5 stars for service, 3 stars for the food. I would like to give this restaurant two different ratings because the difference between the quality of service and the food was significant. We ordered a porcini pizza and had to hunt for the mushrooms. In fact it was sparsely populated with anything mentioned on the menu.

This is our new favorite place for drinks for happy hour!  The Bruschetta Planks are amazing and the wine selection is excellent.   I especially like the outside seating.

We took out of town guests on the Sonoran Desert Adventure and turned out that we learned as much as out guests!  Had no idea about the Southwest Wildlife Conservation Center... WOW!  This is a very special experience for visitors as well as residents.  After this tour, we will spend more time in the McDowell Sonoran Preserve.  Thanks to our guide, Chris, who was very informative and share his knowledge in a friendly manner, we thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon.
