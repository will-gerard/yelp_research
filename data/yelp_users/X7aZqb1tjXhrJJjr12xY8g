When it here for Breakfast and lunch.  Breakfasts are great! You need to try the red velvet pancakes and the con chile verde.

WOW, a lot of you know that I am very easy going person. And it takes a lot to put me on edge.  I just got off the phone with Danny's Family Car Wash corporate office, to report that one of their workers accidentally broke an expensive phone holder in my car a couple weeks ago. I wouldn't make a big deal about this, however, it was a very awful customer service experience and I wanted to share it with my sphere:  1. It took them two weeks to call me. 2. The person I spoke to claimed to have called me last week, but he did not. 3. They refuse to pay for it because they said their worker didn't break it.  How would they know? They weren't even there?  They made no attempt to remedy the situation. The first thing the person at the corporate office said was they aren't going to replace it because the store manager said they didn't break it. The Manager was in his office when it happened, how would he know?  This company seems to not care at all to satisfy their customers one bit. There was no apology, no remorse, no nothing.  After speaking to the person at the corporate office, I told him that I was going to post my experience on FB and he said, "Now you are going to extort me?"  REALLY??? I can't believe that they would rather have a customer upset with them instead of trying to work it out. I used to love bringing my car to Danny's Family Car Wash, but it seems that they have become a shady company, with the whole police raid fiasco.  ARGH! I am all about treating a customer right and providing excellent customer service. I also believe in second chances, so if they see this post and decide to contact me and make it right, I will update/retract this post. But right now, I am just super upset with how I was treated. I love to support my local businesses, but if they don't treat their customers right, then what's the point?  If you also had a bad experience with Danny's Family Car Wash, please share it here with others. Let's try to convince this company to take action towards better customer service. ~ Take Care & God Bless.

Scramble's is one of our favorite breakfast joints. My favorite is the SW burrito.  The place is very contemporary.

Spa Mom was FANTASTIC. I have never had a facial and brow wax before.  But some how Spa Mom convinced me to get one... WOW! I actually loved it.  I loved it so much that I purchased gift certificates for my wife and mother.  They loved it!

This is our second time here. A friend recommended and we are so excited to have a new, fantastic breakfast joint. The food is sooooo good. The ingredients are nice and fresh. What we love most is the customer service. We've had Davina (sp?) as a server twice, and she is phenomenal!  Very attentive, courteous,  and kind. Thank you. It is so nice to have real customer service that leaves a great impression.
