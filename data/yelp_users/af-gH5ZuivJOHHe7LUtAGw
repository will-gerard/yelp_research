This will be our persian kitty's new vet! We were extremely worried when our princess became sick overnight and we rushed down to Scaredy Cat Hospital first thing in the morning. They let us drop her off while she was there and we were relieved that she was being monitored and treated. Everyone there was very nice to work with and communicated well regarding our princess's health status. I was honestly worried sick about my Nyusha and now she is back to her normal crazy self and I couldn't be happier! I love this place!

I am sorry to say, but I am very disappointed in this place and I would strongly never recommend to any of my friends. My reasons are simply because I had treatments done on my legs and face. The first 2 times on my legs were great, the hair seemed to be gone, but slowly started to grow back so I went back again for my legs and the 3rd time made me never want to go back ever again. My legs were very red and started hurting and itching very bad. It looked like I had a very bad rash on my legs. In between the leg treatments, I decided to do full face treatments to get rid of peach fuzz. While doing this, 3 time as well I noticed the hair on my face started to grow back a dark color! Gross!! And it wasn't just peach fuzz, there was hair everywhere!! I was mortified!! On top of that, my face broke out very bad. I am not sure if they do not clean their equipment or not, but I am now being treated by my a dermatologist for my bad acne breakout after going here- and going to a different place to take care of the weird out break of darker hair on my face after the treatments here! I would strongly avoid this place! I feel sorry to give this place 1 star, I really did try my best to give it a try and I spent a lot of money here, even gave $20 tips each time I came in. NEVER again!!!!

I love the Big Kahula Tuna Wrap and the sides that come with it. Canolis are also great. This place was recommended to me by a colleague, I'm glad she did :D I have to agree with a user below though, girls here are a little rude and don't have great customer service - very bad for overall outlook on this business!

Not coming here anymore. The guys working here are so sketchy not because the way they look, but because EVERY time I come here they always find a tiny chip in my windshield and want to fix it (at a cost of course). I remind them my insurance will simply do it for free and have done it for free many times. It's annoying when you guys come up to my car when I'm in the express lane (to avoid you) to try to sell. Another thing, this guy purposely told me to move my car up so I would scratch the rim and it made a loud noise, he made a face and walked away. Not sure if you had a shitty day, but too bad for you I can easily get the scratch and microscopic knick on my windshield fixed.

Gave it two stars because:  1. The food was ok, nothing special. Soup was bland, almost had no flavor.  2. Old lady at cashier desk needs some training on customer service. Extremely rude and made a big deal (and talked bad about me while I was still in front of her) because I paid cash and did not tip her. So, I will point out that I do in fact tip in restaurants ALL the time, but my order was a pick-up. I will only tip pick-up orders if you actually helped prepare my food or if I feel like you are doing an outstanding job customer service wise. Well, you failed at your own job so I didn't tip you on my pick-up order, which was over $20.00 for a lunch special on myself alone. Not only will I not come back here, but I will let others know about the service here. Someone tell the old lady to lighten up or get lost, talking bad about a customer while they are right in front of you is bad service.

I am an expert in eastern European food and I am in love with this place for a long time. My dad took me here a long time ago - I believe I was 12 years old when I first came here. We know the owners and my dad always comes in to chat - they always bring a welcome and warm feeling. The food is amazing. I usually order the same thing (Polish sausage with saurkraut). The only "bad" thing about it, is that it's very far from where I live (Scottsdale), but I end up making the drive to Glendale just to eat here!

Overall: I was extremely happy with this place. Good service, very friendly even though they were very busy, but it was a Sunday afternoon so I can't blame them of course. The environment is absolutely beautiful, I love the little lake and ducks and the people in the restruant were all very lovely people. I will definetly be back to bring my other family members along. The food was very fresh (I had shrimp tacos) and it was very good. Two tacos made me full. Prices? I wouldn't say they are over-priced, for people saying they are over-priced, this is standard for Scottsdale, even though this is Cave Creek area, a lot of us from Scottsdale are very close. :) I forgot to add we had to wait 25 minutes for our table, but they did warn us ahead of time, it was worth the wait. :)

I took my teacup persian here a few times and she loves Amy! Amy does such a great job and knows how to make sure my little persian is calm and happy, I sometimes think that my cat looks forward to going there!

5 stars for the best Chicago hot dog in Arizona! I always stop by here on my way to visit friends/family in Prescott.

It seems like some people in North Scottsdale have low standards? The place is overly crowded I cannot understand why it's not that great. I ended up getting sick after eating here, not just me but my boyfriend too. Oh well, I gave it a try several times only because the location, I will make the drive to find something else.

This place was a nightmare. The experience in general was a nightmare, the salon itself is beautiful. I have been here twice to get my hair lightened to a beach blonde - the first time I paid almost $400.00 which didn't bother me so much, but when the stylist was done with my hair, it came out orange.. I decided to give Dolce another try and went back to get it done. Again, I spent another $300.00 to $400.00 and my hair came out a weird orangey blonde. It was ugly. I will never go back here again. The experience was horrible, the staff is terrible. They act very stuck-up - which is strange because they work in a hair salon. I understand this is Scottsdale, but people who work in these types of jobs, which I consider, customer service, should not have stuck-up attitudes - no matter what location you work at. I already told all my friends not to go here.

The food here is amazing! I consider my boyfriend and I to be regulars since we have been coming here for about 1 1/2 years. We live down the street and the location is absolutely beautiful. My boyfriend and I have no complaints and we have recommended The Egg I Am to friends and family. Not sure what the complaints from other users regarding the owner, Robin. I think she is a fantastic person overall, very well-respected and has been nothing, but kind to me since I have been coming here. I feel sorry for the other users who cannot see that she is running a business and do not know what it's like to run a business. Great food and great service.

Taste of Greek is exceptional! We come here at least twice a week because we like the food so much. I usually order chicken gyro and sometimes pita with hummus. I highly recommend this place. The owner is very nice and I believe his son works the register, he is also very nice and outgoing. I work next to another gyro place, but after work I make the drive to this one instead.

Best pizza in North Scottsdale, and probably best pizza in Arizona! The vegetables taste fresh and atmosphere is very comfortable and relaxing. We waited for our pizza at the bar and the bartender, James was very nice and assisting us while we waited for our pizza. Will be recommending this place to everyone!

I absolutely love this Armani Exchange! The location is great also. I am a regular at this store - where I usually purchase my clothes because Armani has clothes that fit me perfect where I do not have to get them tailored. The store usually changes what they have in stock frequently, to keep a variety of clothing for both men and women. The guys that work there are just wonderful - they are very polite and friendly. They always grab my clothes and take them to the dressing room, because they already know that I will be purchasing some stuff! I recommended this Armani Exchange to my friends who love fashion and trendy clothing.

Came here only because Kabuki had a 30 min. wait and we were super hungry so we came here. First of all, the environment was plain and uncomfortable setting. I understand this is a rotating sushi bar, but this was just so weird! Second, the food was tasteless and to be honest the worst sushi I ever had - I would rather pay extra and grab sushi from AJ's. Third, the waitress was so terrible! She didn't ask us how we were doing and got my drink wrong. I tipped her the amount I would do to a pick-up order, it was that bad. Advice to the owners: change the setting, teach your staff good customer service, and work on the taste of the food. Won't be coming back here - ever.

Yes I drove 30-35 minutes to The Fry Bread House because of indian fry bread. We went to Payson recently had it there and really wanted indian fry bread!! Has anyone had it? If not, you need to! Since we made the drive there we decided to try their indian style tacos - the beans, cheese and toppings were surrounding by a lightly fried and fluffed "shell" - it was delicious! We did sit down inside, different environment than what we are used to (sticky everything and different crowd of people). You have to give this place a try regardless.

Went here with my boyfriend and his colleagues. The environment is interesting. No privacy and too loud. The food was much to heavy for me, I just ordered some champagne and cheese with bread. The bread was burnt and so hard that when I bit into it, it was a struggle. I didn't even finish the bread because it was so burnt. The champagne was good! I guess this place is just for hungry ASU students. :)

Of course you can't rely on the people of Scottsdale on their yelp reviews, sad. Anyway, on to the my review. Ordered regular philly roll with miso soup. Both bland and something I wouldn't go back to - which, glad I didn't, looks like Nori Sushi has 4 food violations according to CBS 5 news.  http://www.cbs5az.com/story/30822961/dirty-dining-dec-24-two-valley-restaurants-have-5-health-code-violations

This place is cute. I am not sure why other people say the girls are rude here, I didn't think so. I LOVE the tropical cooler! This is my favorite! Not sweet tasting at all like Jamba Juice. I believe the calorie content is less than Jamba Juice as well. I tried the Acai Peanut Butter Bowl. This was very good as well, but it was really big for me! :D I can never finish it! Tips for the owners: Maybe have smaller portions for us super skinny people and please try to be open earlier! I am an early bird and so are a lot of others in Scottsdale! It would be nice to grab a drink before work out or after! I will be back and I have recommended this place to my friends. I've been to the one on Scottsdale Rd as well, just as good as this one on Shea!
