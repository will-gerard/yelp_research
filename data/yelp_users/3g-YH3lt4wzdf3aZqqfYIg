Eating here it felt like I was Riding a Unicorn down a mountain while drinking from a Goblet filled with the laughter of Children. Demolition Man the movie has Taco Bell as a fine dining establishment in the future I can now see why. Eating the Chalupa Supreme makes me have faith in humanity that we can over come obstacles and create beautiful things. You could put anything inside a Chalupa bun and it would be delicious. I cut off some of my beard and put it in the Chalupa it was outstanding. I think part of the reason it was so good is because I had some Hummus from Greek Pita left in my beard.

This place came highly recommended on the Food Network so I had to check it out. Chuck E Cheese Pizza is the final level of pizza. The pizza is made fresh daily from world renown chefs from Italy. They have innovative ingredients like Pepperoni, Sausage and Extra Cheese. I believe the Cheese comes from God himself or possibly a cow but my instincts tell me that the cheese was created in the Nethworlds or by a powerful wizard. I like being wizards in Role Playing Games. At first they aren't as strong as warriors but when you build your character up, the wizards tend to end up more powerful. If I were a wizard in real life my main ability would be to Conjur Chuck E Cheese pizza. Let's say a Troll group was attacking me, I would just Conjur up 32 Large Pizza's with extra cheese and the Trolls would just start eating the pizza and forget about me. How this place hasn't won any Michelin Stars or James Beard Awards are beyond me. This is fine dining at it's absolute best!

I'm a jewish man from NY. I know my italian food and my chinese food. This is the best chinese restaurant i've been to out here. The steam fwied dumprings & crab pruffs are incredible. The Shrimp grand marnier is out of this world. My girlfriend usually get the sweet and sour chicken and she loves it. Go here and go to sweet republic which is RIGHT NEXT DOOR for ice cream which is the best ice cream in the universe. You're all welcome

I'm a jew from NY and i know my pizza. Bianco, spinato's, grimaldis and pizzeria federal are all better. The hot sandwiches they serve for lunch during the day are the whip so is the nutelle crepe. Service & atmosphere are good. You can't go wrong for lunch or date night.

Wow. What can I say? One night after work I was driving home and I was so hungry I stopped at Burger King. Jesus Christ this stuff is awesome. Flemings, City Hall, Mortons are all childs play compared to Burger King. The Apollo Missions, The Pyramids are not mans finest achievement but in fact it is the #1 Without Pickles. I went through drive through and ate my entire meal while sitting in my driveway without my wife knowing. I should have probably called her to ask if she wanted anything, after all she did mother my child but I am just so selfish when it comes to my fast food burger I couldn't help myself. Long Live My Beard

$60 wagyu came out raw, carrots were raw. No hostess. A server had to sit us. This place used to be really good but for the money go to hillstone, ocean club or capital grill. $140 for utter diarrhea

I sit in a cubicle for 40 hours a week. My life is miserable during those hours. The one thing to lift my spiritis is Greek Pita. I dream that one day my cubicle will turn into Pita Bread with Hummus so I can eat it. I also think it is highly beneficial to have a long beard while going to Greek Pita as I came back from lunch and found a pita crumb with Hummus on my beard, needless to say I ate it.

Field of dreams with Kevin Costner said it best. Is this heaven? No its churn. I ordered a scoop of vanilla with whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles because I'm a boss and level 59 division agent. The only negative is I get gas after I eat ice cream so I'm hiding in my gaming room right now until it blows over. I would recommend. Ample parking

I'm shocked at the good reviews. Their naan bread is frozen pizza dough. I love indian food but this place just isn't good.

In finality I would say my experience at Simis cafe was sublime. My treatment was that of a gladiator most decorated.

This place is awesome. I remember in 5th grade during summer camp one year I had diarrhea the entire summer. Mind you I went to a sleep away camp for 2 months. I would wake up in the middle of the night and would crap in my underwear. I would than bury my tighty whities the next day, because I was embarrassed to even have the laundry people see I was crapping myself. I was also to embarrassed to see a doctor. By end of the summer I had no more underwear. My mom questioned me when I got back but I told her the laundry people kept losing it. To this day I'm curious if my underwear is still buried in the same spots. Flower child is healthy and delicious. Fun upbeat atmosphere. Ample parking.

I work in the mortgage business and I'm very familiar with realtors as I interact with them on a daily basis. Mike is very patient and sharp. I recently worked with him on a transaction and the buyers wouldn't stop raving about him and my team thoroughly enjoyed working with him. Very professional.

0-2 Chicago. First portillo's, now this. Lou Malnati's, is not deep dish. It's just thick crust. The crust is tasteless, not oily or buttery. It's just like NY Sicilian. Portillo's is utter diarrhea and this place is just average. People from Chicago have no taste buds. Lou Malnati, what you just made is one of the most insanely average things I've ever eaten. At no point during my meal was it even close to be considered awesome. Everyone that has eaten there is now dumber because of it. I award you no points, and may god have mercy on your soul.

This place is awesome and healthy. I took my friend Jason there and he was even given a gift card for free meal. My buddy was nice enough to give away his lunch to a stranger and they made him.a new one! For being a healthy option it's really good plus the pickles are tasty. It soaks into the bread which my other friend Josh loves. My friend Josh doesn't like pizza or chipotle  (I know he's a monster) but he would come back

Kate J who gave a 2 star review is a schmuck. This place is amazing. I could care less if the chef talked to me or not (which he did btw). Seriously the absolute best pasta I've ever eaten. This place is better than Rockys deli.

You're all idiots. They have great steamed buns. I have an elder Chinese man that lives in my head and approves of their steamed buns. Ample parking
