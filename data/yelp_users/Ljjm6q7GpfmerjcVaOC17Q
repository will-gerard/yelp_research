This location is terrible. They did nothing but screw up multiple cars of mine. Now it's two years later, and the compressor they broke and replaced is broken again.   DO NOT GO THERE!

Best chain style pizza in town. We alternate between here, Spinato's, and Streets, but Rosatis double thick is my fav. Be warned though, it's pretty expensive so it wouldn't be my choice when all the guys are over for football. But it's perfect for family pizza night.  This location is delivery and take out only.

Don't send your kids to any of their summer programs. My daughter (6yrs old) went and had a terrible experience, and we ended up just pulling her out. They spent the majority of their time just in a room supervised by a couple of girls just left to play with the toys there or do whatever. We weren't happy with it at all.  Giving them 2 stars just because the club itself looks nice.

Don't live in Vegas. Drove up here and my Xterra started overheating. This place happened to be a few blocks from where I was staying and received a few good reviews on Yelp so I decided to try it out since I didn't have any other options. I absolutely hate dealing with car repair shops because I always feel like I'm being ripped off.  All that being said, this place was fantastic. I was really worried I'd overheated enough to crack the engine which I thought was causing me to lose coolant because I couldn't find the leak on my own, and I told them that. Turns out, it was just a hose and a leaky seal. I brought my car in at 11:30am, and they were finished with it by 6pm for less than $200. Would go back, and would recommend to anyone.

Very pleased with our first experience with Galloping Groomers. Linda was on time, pleasant to work with, and trimmed our Goldendoodle exactly as requested. With so many people having problems just finding a mobile groomer much less a good one, I don't know why you'd ever look anywhere else.  We've used other mobile groomers before that charged $100 for our dog, which is the same as the local groomer charges. GG only charged $67. And they have a first timer $10 off coupon on their website.  Will definitely use them again.

One of my favorite nightspots in the city. The other reviews all say it all, but I'll chime in briefly:  - Best winelist in Scottsdale, and a mostly knowledgeable staff. Only once have we had a sub par server.  - Dark, euro/middle eastern decor, comfy couches, interesting music. Great for a date and even better with a big group of people.  - Great food. flatbread pizzas, sausage and pretzel, cheese plates, olives, yum!

It's pricey, but the food is spectacular. There wasn't much on the menu that I didn't think sounded great. I would have given it 5 stars but out service was pretty slow so I just couldn't pull the trigger on that :)  Sit on the lower patio, the views (especially of the sunset) are amazing.  Definitely will be back. We were there on a Tuesday night and the place was packed at 6pm.

I'm not one of those people who are too impressed by the fake sky and indoor canal in the venetian, so if that's interesting to you, you might enjoy this place more. I think the food here is good not great. We started with a queso appetizer and added jalapenos to it. It was just huge chunks of jalapeno and very little cheese and almost inedible.  For dinner I had the five tacos. The steak and pork were great, the fish was meh. $5 house margarita for happy hour was nice.   Good place to stop for a quick lunch but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.

Always a treat to get back to Barrio. Looks like they've painted some fun murals on the walls in the back parking lot. Feels a little less like we'll get mugged back there heh. Barrio is our favorite Mexican restaurant in the city. You'll probably read a lot of people giving it bad ratings because they didn't get rice and beans with their entree, chips and salsa before hand, and saying ridiculous things like how much better La Parilla Suiza is lol. So if you go and you aren't familiar with authentic southern mexican cuisine, just understand that you aren't going to Macayos.  Started off last night with the Queso Fundido. It's the only reason my review isn't getting 5 stars. (well, that and what I consider lackluster but competent service) First time I've ever had anything there that I didn't think was just amazing. It really fell flat and didn't have a lot of flavor. Other appetizers we've had there were out of this world so this one was extra disappointing. My wife and I both hand margaritas which were great. They have pretty much every type of tequila known to man there also.  For the entrees, I had the pork tacos. As I was eating them I told my wife that they were the best tacos I've ever had in my entire life. She had one of the quesadillas and loved it also.  Highly recommend Barrio. Like I said, it's the best Mexican in the city imo, and the tableside quac there is the best you'll ever have.

How Fez isn't 5 stars just blows my mind. Best restaurant in the city. Had the Lamb Kisra last night, it's probably my 15th favorite entree on the menu, and it was still fabulous.   Friend them on FB and you'll get an update everyday of the specials. So good. Not much more to say, it's the best. Mascarpone Cheesecake omg!  Mark

Finally made it out last night. Place has a lot of hype and has been on our list for a while now. Atmosphere was great, lots of red, lots of latin hipsterness.  Our party started off with a pitcher of the White Kiwi Sangria, the Guacamus, and the lettuce wraps. I'm not as big a fan of white sangria as red, and I thought it was good but not great. I've definitely had better. The lettuce wraps were 180 degrees from what I was expecting. (the standard pf chang's type deal) They were basically a fruit and nut compote on a thin crunchy leaf of lettuce. Really really good with the sangria. I'm also not a big fan of guacamole but the guacamus (guac and hummus spread) was pretty good, and my guac loving companions thought it was amazing. Definitely a must try.  For dinner we had a pitcher of the Passion Fruit Sangria, and my wife and I split the Grilled Peach Salad w/ chicken and the Pork Torta. Both were excellent, the Torta especially. It came with huge crosscut fries and coleslaw. The flavors of the sandwich were excellent and I was bummed to have to share half of it. The sangria was pretty good but with all the hype about it being the best sangria ever, I didn't think it was quite to that level. But still, yum.  Our service was a bit slow but our waiter was super friendly and the 3 women in my party all thought he was ridiculously hot. Later in the evening he spent some time chatting with us at the table, and told us that the bar side of the restaurant is a lot of fun later at night when the restaurant side clears out. He did however forget to bring us the extra pita chips we asked for to finish off our Guacamus, which made me a sad panda. The prices for the food were pretty standard, although I thought the $26 for a pitcher of Sangria was a little steep.  I wish I could give Ticoz 3.5 stars because it really is better than your standard 3 star but not really quite up to the 4 star level that most of my favorites are. But that being said, it has a lot going for it and it's definitely worth trying because the entrees really were amazing and the menu was full of things I'd love to try. Also the weekend breakfast with $2 mimosas sounds pretty darn good to me. Will definitely be back for that :)

One of the best in Vegas, second only to Sen for sushi imo. Atmosphere was good, service was mediocre if not a little slow, but the sushi was killer. Great rolls, perfect nigiri, yummy cocktails. And absolutely the best value for sushi I've had anywhere. So stinking cheap considering how great everything was.

Heard about St. Francis from a friend and have been meaning to try it for a while now. We finally made it out and weren't disappointed. It's one of our new favorites. (Honestly every restaurant that has any sort of association to the LGO group turns out to be great in our experience, so we weren't surprised)  Decor is modern, atmosphere is great. We were there on a Tuesday night and the place was packed. They only take reservations for large parties so we had about a 30 min wait which we spent drinking on the outside patio. They have a bar along the front of the restaurant that opens up to both the restaurant inside and the patio outside, which is a really nice touch and adds to the atmosphere.  The food is upscale comfort food I guess? We started with the baked goat cheese app. It was flavorful and the pesto was such a good touch. The toasted bread was a little hard imo.  For dinner we had a bottle of the malbec which was outstanding. Both my wife and I thought it was one of the best $35 bottles (restaurant price obv) that we've ever had. We shared the burger and the pork chop. The burger was a perfect medium rare which made me happy. The pork chop was great and the polenta had a hint of horseradish. I couldn't have been happier. There wasn't any part of the meal we didn't think was perfect.  Oh, and for dessert have the sticky pudding. It's out of this world.  Overall it was a perfect night. Plus we felt like the prices were really reasonable. One caveat, as some others have said, it's a hopping place and is pretty loud inside. We love that, but we were commenting while there how our parents probably wouldn't like dining there because it's not a quiet relaxing place..We'll definitely be back though :)

Went to Bomberos last night for the first time, and our group really loved the place. One of the better patios in town imo. Huge mesquite trees all over give it tons of shade and awesome mood lighting and candles in the evening make for a great night. And misters...lots and lots of misters! The patio is definitely a popular place because by 10pm the inside of the restaurant was empty but the patio was still packed!  The South American music was pumping and the couches and cozy chairs made it a relaxing evening of wine and nosh. Great selection of wines. We had the cheese board, the meat plate, and a few orders of bruchetta. They were all good but not great. (For instance, I'd much rather have a meat and cheese selection from Kazimierz or bruchetta from Postinos) But that was ok because the atmosphere made up for it.  And the dessert, oh my the dessert. They had two and we ordered both. A bread pudding which was probably the best I've ever had, and an orange creme brule which was SOOOOO smooth. Mmmm. I love orange in desserts and it definitely didn't disappoint. Ordered a mocha to go with it and and it was big and tasty. (It could have been a little warmer though)  Overall, great place. Good but not great food, great desserts, great atmosphere, great for medium sized groups of friends who want to have a night out to catch up with each other's lives.

Best place to have lunch in the NE valley. Never has disappointed. And when the weather is nice and they open up, the patio and bar are so nice.  Food is fresh and great, service is always with a smile, the only downside is the wait sometimes. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

Wow, this place was so terrible. We had a $25 restaurant.com gift certificate that we bought for $2.50, and we still didn't think it was worth it. Service is super slow, the atmosphere is terrible (its in the lobby of a Sheraton by the airport) and the food is the worst of all.  We started off with the nachos and they were decent. The service was brutally slow even though barely anyone was there, we had to repeatedly ask for refills on our soda, and our dinner took forever to arrive.  We ordered a bean and cheese burrito for our daughter (not on the kids menu???) and it came full of tons of non kid friendly things like peppers and onions. My wife ordered the taco salad and it came with guac and sour cream on it (which the menu didn't say) and it didn't come with a black bean salsa that the menu did say it came with.  I ordered a fish dish served over gnocchi which was really bland. The only good entree at the table was the Chorizo Chicken.  Anyway, just don't go here.

Great little restaurant up north in Carefree. Not a ton of inside seating, but they have a pretty good sized patio to make up for it. We were greeting by one of the servers at the door and were told we'd have about a 15 to 20 minute wait. She brought us a bottle of wine, and made sure to clear some room for us at the bar the instant it became available while we were waiting.  The menu wasn't large but all the entrees looked amazing. There weren't really many light, healthy options to choose from though. (other than salads) We started off with the Gnocchi appetizer while waiting at the bar, it was good but I'd probably go with something else next time.  For dinner we had: the scallops, which were amazing; the fig and goat cheese salad, which was very good; and the salmon, which was also very good.  The downside of Bink is that it's pretty expensive. Most of the entrees are $20+. I definitely think the food is worth it, but the atmosphere of the place doesn't seem to really fit with the prices. It's a casual cafe type of place, but the food/prices are what you'd find at a fine dining restaurant.  I loved it, the service was excellent, food was great, etc. But I'm not sure if I'd go back. If I wanted a more scaled down cafe, I'd probably stick with Herb Box at DC Ranch or something similar, and if I wanted the fine dining experience I'd prefer to go to a more upscale restaurant (like it's namesake Binkleys for instance) instead of eating at Cafe Bink.  Also, they only take reservations for parties of 5 or more.

Seems to be a theme in Vegas lately. Food is great, service was terrible.  Briefly on the food: Started off with the Kobe beef meatball with ricotta. Spectacular. Had the rigatoni sausage bolognese and it was very good also. Nothing on the menu really stood out to me as very interesting, but it all looked great. And while we didn't make it to dessert, we saw some of the options at the tables near us and they looked spectacular.  Now on to the service: Had a reservation for 10, seated by 10:30, meh. Our server was friendly, so I'll give him that much. We ordered a bottle of wine which we then were informed they were out of. Ordered a different bottle. When served, our glasses were overfilled and our server didn't leave the cork, both of which are pet peeves. Whatever nbd.  Ordered the meatball and were told water and garlic bread would be right out. Water finally arrived when the meatball did but no garlic bread. I reminded our server about the bread and he told me "Oh I'm sorry, it comes fresh so it takes a while." Well, our meatball I assume is made fresh and yet it not only has arrived but has been eaten. So I doubt the problem is that the garlic bread is custom made for us. I hate lame excuses from servers, just say you're sorry and get it.  Finally our entree arrives, served by someone else. We eat for a bit and our server comes over to check on how things are. My wife reminds him AGAIN about he garlic bread. He runs off to get it, comes back a little while later, and tells us "He made sure to get it himself for us." Well, thanks so much for going out of your way like that buddy.  We finished dinner, dessert menus were dropped off. 10 minutes later he finally comes by again to check and see if we'd like dessert. Easily the longest I've ever waited to be asked if I want dessert or coffee, it seriously felt like an eternity.  Anyway, as always in Vegas, there are much better options around, and this isn't one of them.

Big fan. Location is great, sushi is excellent. This is one of Eddie Chan's restaurants. You can find the menu at http://www.echandining.com/  Restaurant itself isn't very exciting, it's just a small box in a strip mall. Service was good, the staff was nice and accommodating. They deliver from 5 to 9pm most nights.  Love it for take-out though. They havve a $17, 10 piece nigiri plus cali roll deal. They pick, but it comes with 2 each of salmon, tuna, red snapper, shrimp, and yellowtail usually, and you can sub out the cali roll for something else and pay the difference.

Small little Italian place, only about 15 tables total. Family owned, huge wood-fired pizza oven, nice but casual ambiance. Food was excellent, service was meh.  We started off with a bottle of their Super Tuscan and the calamari app. It was good and big enough to feed 4. Our server overfilled our glasses and kept them too full all night.  Had the gnocchi bolognese and a pizza, both were excellent. Finished with a cannoli. (cannolo?)  So yeah, food was really really good, our server was super nice but he just didn't seem very experienced. Also, granted it was a Tuesday night, but we were easily the youngest people in the place when we arrived around 7:30, and we closed the place down at 9pm. So expect an earlier, more elderly crowd. We'll go back.

Pros: Atmosphere is hoping, nice views, open late  Cons: Food was mediocre and is essentially overpriced bar food.  The complimentary pretzels were a nice surprise. Started with a pitcher of the sangria, it was good not great, and the walnut shrimp appetizer. For $18 I expected to get some tasty walnut encrusted shrimp. Instead, we received a bunch of overcooked shrimp in a sweet cream sauce with MAYBE 6 walnut bits tossed on top of the bowl. Truly a terrible appetizer.  For dinner my wife and I split the Orange Beef. $26. It was really good, but even in Vegas I wouldn't say the value was there. I was also surprised at how it was prepared. The medallions of beef were rather large and very rare. I was pretty happy about this but I could see a lot of people ordering and it being too rare for their tastes.  In any other city I'd give it 3 stars and move along, but in Vegas with the plethora of great dining options here, I don't think the value is anywhere close to what you pay for. Overpriced average food, with a few gems on the menu that keep people coming back.

Mistakenly went again forgetting we'd been here before. Was just as disappointing, even more actually because the amazing pretzels they used to give you seem to have disappeared :(  It's Vegas, you can do much better.

Really thought I was going to like this place a lot more than I did. The service was really fast and friendly and the atmosphere was hopping, but that's the best I can say. I was really disappointed in the sandwiches we had. The bread was just standard store bought bread, and the meat (especially the turkey) was just gross processed yuck. Also this might be a little nit picky, but it tilts me so much when I get a sandwich and the meat is all squished up in a ball in the middle and you can tell they didn't even attempt to evenly distribute it over the bread.  So yeah, we were really disappointed given the hype MMD has. And like many others have said, for the quality, the price is WAY too high. There are a bunch of other local gourmet shops with the same prices and killer sandwiches.

We've been hearing about Beckett's for a while now and finally made it out to give it a try. So glad we did, it was really great. The restaurant is really beautiful inside. I love open spaces and open kitchens, and the bar, wood beams, and small touches like the sliding bathroom doors really make me happy. They even have a large community table that seats 16 which I really think fosters a great atmosphere of communal dining. There is nothing better than walking into a restaurant for the first time and just knowing you're going to love the food because the ambiance is so good. That is how you feel when you walk in here.  We started with a bottle of wine and the sausage meatballs. OMG they were amazing. Probably one of my favorite appetizers anywhere. I am literally thinking of just ordering 3 for dinner next time I'm there. My wife and I shared the chicken and dumplings and a side of mac and cheese for dinner. Great flavor, dumplings were perfect, I would have liked to see a little more chicken in the entree though. Mac and cheese was yummy, could have been a little warmer imo.   For dessert, we shared the smores which everyone raves about. We both agreed, the whipped peanut butter was to die for, the graham crackers were good, the marshmallows were amazing....but we just didn't like the chocolate covered bacon. I LOVE chocolate. And I LOVE bacon. In and on everything. But the combination just didn't do it for us. Once the chocolate taste wore off the bacon just didn't taste good.  Oh well, we'll have to have the Death By Chocolate next time :)

Well, I hate when I'm the outlier to otherwise really good reviews, because it means we probably just caught them on a bad night. That being said, we won't ever be back. Went last Sunday evening for my birthday, service was terrible. And I mean not just normal terrible but I thought about leaving less than 15% terrible which is just unheard of for ex servers like us. Food was only mediocre.  The first of our party of four arrived and was seated on the patio at 5:55. The patio is amazing of course with all the nice couches etc, unless you are sat at a little plastic fold up table with folding chairs like we were. The rest of us arrived at 6 and finally at 6:10 our server came by for the first time and took our drink order. We still didn't even have waters yet. Our server was clearly swamped, and seemed responsible for the entire patio which was full. We would have to flag her down for every interaction going forward, and then wait forever for whatever we ordered to arrive.  I started with a glass of sangria, it was okay. We had the cheese board and the bruschetta, they were okay. We had a couple of pizzas, they were okay. The food was noticeably worse than, Postino for example. My companions all thought the pizza was pretty good, but they are wrong. :)  So yeah, I'm sure it's better than the experience we had there and I don't feel like blathering on about just how bad the service was that night, but I won't be back. Oh another thing, they cut their bruschetta into 3 slices instead of 4. Our little group of 4 are regulars at Postino who of course do 4 slices each so that was pretty tilting. :)

Amazing dessert, can't say much that hasn't been said already. It's like the Japanese decided to take the art of perfection they have and apply it to dessert.  It was my second time there, and I was a little disappointed. No more edible menu, and less courses. But for a wannabe foodie it's heaven watching these women create the most delicious and beautiful food you'll ever put in your mouth.

Incredible service, prompt on time delivery. Great designs. The owners seen to take personal pride in their work.  Would highly recommend to anyone who needs arrangements for weddings, funerals, etc, or just needs a quick bouquet on the way home.
