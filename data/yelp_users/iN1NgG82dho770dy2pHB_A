I talked to Levi about my old door lock that had broke. He wanted to come by to make sure he was right. He was able to look at it and quickly tell me that the gate I had was enough security and that it was not worth it to try to fix the lock on my Arcadia door. He was very knowledgeable and explained everything. He also, at no charge, he drilled a hole in my door so I could use an existing lock. I feel much safer after he came and checked it out. I have already refereed him to others!

Terrible service. The teenager working the counter didn't pay attention to the customers. Sadly I didn't look in my bag until I was on the road and about to take a bite when I realized it was covered in bacon. I'm allergic to pork. Had I bitten into it, I would have died.

Desert Data Recovery are my heroes! When our NAS drive at our office that contained ALL of our client files, years and years of work, these two were able to get it all back in 24 hours! When I initially called Nicky she was so calm and kind. Dropping off the drive I was nervous and excited. We knew from an out of state company that they could recover the data, this came with a long time frame and an even larger price tag! Desert Data was amazing and we are up and going again! Definitely worth knowing people with such amazing skills!

Such amazing pizza!! White Pizza is the best! Too bad it's kind of expensive. So we save it for special occasions! The 24 Inch pizza is a challenge....haven't been able to do it yet!!
