My review is based on scheduling. After being sick for many weeks, and several trips to the doctor, I finally landed in Urgent Care. The urgent care doc ordered a CT scan and referred me here. The instructions from the doctor were that I needed to be seen within the next two days based on my symptoms. I called to schedule the appointment and was told the earliest they could schedule me was EIGHT days out due to requiring insurance pre-authorization. I told the scheduler "I have a PPO." "That doesn't matter." She said. I told her "The doctor said I need to be seen within the next two days." That didn't matter either. I even offered to pay for the procedure myself, on my credit card and wait for reimbursement, but was told no. I asked if they had any earlier appointments. "Yes, but those are saved for patients with insurance pre-authorization." I was so upset I was ready to just go to the ER and get the testing over with! Luckily, a friend suggested Valley Radiologists (see review)- they had no problems making me an appt the same day. No hassles! :) Sorry SimonMed, you have lost my business!

This is the place to go for your imaging needs. Scheduling very easy. I had an order from an urgent care doctor and they were able to get me in same day. Friendly staff put me at ease (I was a little nervous).  My appt was at 830a. I was told to show up 15-20 min early for paperwork. I show up at 8:07a. Complete paperwork. Get called back for procedure at 8:25a. Done and on the road by 8:45a. Radiologist transcribed report and sent over to my doc w/ in 3 hours! :)
