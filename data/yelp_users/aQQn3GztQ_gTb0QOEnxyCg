I had almost given up on Mexican food in Phoenix.  I tried this place on a Friday during lunch.  I had a combo meal that included a taco and cheese enchilada.  This restaurant is one of my new favorites.  The cheese enchilda was a great choice.  Excellent flavor.  The taco was also nice and crispy, and the beef had great flavor.  The chips and salsa were very good.  The salsa was not the best I have ever had, but very good.  I wish they would put the salsa in bowls.  I cant stand eating salsa off of plates.  I will definitely return to this location.  Great food and service.

Tried this place out a couple weeks ago on a whim and must have picked the right night to go.  They had a live band that played great music.  The drinks were definitely pricey, but were good.  I wouldn't go here all the time, but it is nice bar that avoids a lot of the scottsdale club scene if you want to get away from that.

This place is horrible.  The sandwhich/paninis can be summarized as follows.  They take some french bread, put maybe a slice of meat or two on it, but no more, and toast it.  They have absolutely no meat on them.  You will leave hungry, along with lunch taking a bite out of your pocket book.  Pricey and bad service.  I have eaten here 3 times, as I used to work in the vicinity, and every time I had absolutely horrible service.  I always have to get up and ask for napkins, refills, silverware, whatever it may be.  Also, there pastry selection is always inconsistent.  I have also had several of their muffins.  They are ok, but not anything special.  I would not recommend this place and certainly will not go back.

Excellent service and great tasting food.  What more could you ask for?  A bit pricey, but that is to be expected with the level of quality.  The wait staff will cater to your every need and will make sure your lunch or dinner is to your liking.    I came here for lunch on a business lunch and it was everything I expected.  I had the chicken caesar salad and it was great.    If you are looking for a place to meet up after work or to have a power lunch, I definitely recommend this place.

I have been to this location 2 times.  Both times the food was excellent.  The lobster mac and cheese is a great side and would highly recommend if you must choose just 1.  But all the sides are excellent.  As for the steak itself....they are great.  The bone-in Kona crusted is my personal favorite, however, you really cant go wrong with any of the suggestions.  The service is exactly what you would expect from this type of a restaurant.  I only give this 4 stars, as I had to wait for about 20 minutes for a table, even though I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance.  Also, the table they eventually sat us at had no one sitting at it for the 20 minutes that we waited.  If it was not for this, it would be 5 stars.  Also, a bit pricey, but it is relative to any other steak house.  Creme brulee was also very good.

Tried this place out for the first time, and I believe they have a returning customer.  At first glance, you would likely overlook this hidden gem.  It is tucked away in the back of strip mall.  The interior looks like it is from the 70's with hardwood paneling.  However, don't let this fool you.  It has been owned and operated by the same family for over 30 years.  It is very cheap and is a great deli.  The chicken salad club is awesome.  Definitely try this if it is your first time.  The Italian sub was also good.  The bread is what makes these sandwiches so great.  The Philly sub also looked great, and I will return for that.    The service was spectacular and they treat you like you are an old friend.  Every member of the family chips in, and they go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your meal.  This is so rare in today's society.  If you buy 2 during the week you get 1 free as well...awesome deal!

I ended up at this restaurant because of a recent livingsocial.com deal.  It turned out to be a great buy and allowed me to find some "authentic" mexican food in Phoenix.  I was really pleased with this restaurant, and will definitely return.  For starters, the chips and salsa were excellent.  And you can have as much as you want, without being charged for an extra basket of chips.  I ordered a combo plate with tamale, taco, and cheese enchilada.  It also came with rice and beans.  Everything was great.  The enchilada was my favorite part of the dish, and I will definitely stick with this next time.  The tamale was very good for a restaurant tamale, and would hold up with any home made tamale out there.  The taco was not the best.  the meat was a little overcooked do to the deep frying of the shell, but it was still good.  Just not my personal favorite.  The enchilada was very good.  You could taste the home made tortillas and the red sauce was very tasty.  Definitely recommend.  The rice was very good and authentic.  The beans were ok, but not the best I have ever had.  All in all, this is the best mexican food I have had so far in Phoenix.  It only gets 4 stars though, because I have had much better in other cities.  But so far, I have not found better in Phoenix.    This will definitely be a frequently visited spot to satisfy my craving for authentic mexican food.

This place is awesome.  We stopped here on our way back to Scottsdale from Sedona.  A little unsure of what to expect, our expectations were far exceeded once we were served our dinner.  I had the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and my wife had the honey fried chicken.  Both were great.  The real highlight, however, is their famous pies.  We ordered 3 different ones because we could not decide on which to order.  We had the coconut cream, jack daniels pecan, and rhubarb.  The rhubarb was my favorite of the 3 but all were amazing.  I would travel to this restaurant just for a slice of pie.  If you are passing by on the 17, make this one of your stops.  You will not be disappointed.

This place is strictly a dessert place.  While they serve food, I would skip the food and go right to the dessert.  At least that is what I do, being that I have only eaten dessert at this place.  I have been here 3 times, all of which have been very good.  My only complaint is that the sundae's are a little pricey and the decor is pretty dated.  But it is an authentic retro, ice cream parlor.  The sundaes are always made up to perfection.  They have many unique flavors and I have enjoyed each one.    Next time you are in need for a sugar fix, give this place a try!

I have been to this wine bar on several occasions and I always leave with a smile on my face. First, this place has the most impressive wine list I have ever seen.  Basically anything you are looking for and within any price range.  Second, the service has always been great.  The waiters will always try and help you find that perfect bottle of wine so you don't throw your money away.  They are always willing to suggest various wines and most of the time will allow you to taste a wine, if they have an open bottle behind the bar.  Last, the atmosphere can't be beat.  It is reminiscent of a speakeasy and is very dark.  This place can get pretty loud if there is a band or music, but overall this place is great and I highly recommend going for a bottle of wine post dinner.

This has become my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale for a nice dinner out.  The menu was very unique and they serve generous portions, unlike most of the Scottsdale restaurants.    To start, our party had 5 people and we had reservations on a Saturday night.  We were seated immediately upon check-in, something that many of the nice steak houses and other restaurants still can't quite figure out.    We all started with a glass of beer, which they have a great beer and wine selection.  They carry many great choices at reasonable prices.  Our group split the quesadilla of the day, which was very good.  It changes, so I can't remember the actual ingredients, but one of the better quesadillas I have had.  For the main course, I had the pork porterhouse, which does not appear to be on the menu currently.  It was great.  The side came with potatoes au gratin, but was a very unique taste and this alone would bring me back.  I also sampled the mushroom pan-fry, their signature dish.  This was absolutely great and I may order this when I come back again.  Overall a great restaurant in Old Town.  Make sure to have reservations though!

What a hidden gem!  I have been searching for a good asian restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale for some time now...and the search is over.  First, don't let the location scare you off.  The original location is certainly not in the best spot, next to a planned parenthood, but once you are inside the asian decor makes you forget where you are.  The portions are absolutely huge.  One entree is more than enough for two people.    To start, my fiance and I had the Pho Tae Bo Vein.  This Pho hangs with the best.  A great selection of garnishments accompanies the soup.  Great taste and an entree in and of itself.  I will come back just for this dish.  We then ordered the Kang Keo Wan and the Chiang Mai Noodles.  These dishes taste essentially the same.  However, the Chiang Mai Noodles was had a little sweeter taste to it.  Overall, the spices were great, not to spicy but enough to have flavor.  Try this place out!

Being from Tucson, I used yelp to try and locate what is supposedly the best mexican food in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  I had high hopes when I arrived at this restaurant.  It is charming, and looks authentic.  Much like the restaurants down in Tucson.  The chips and salsa came out quick, and the service was great.  Chips and salsa were very good.  However, I was disappointed that you only get one serving, and then you have to pay $3 for another....something that I have never seen before.  But sadly, this is was the only positive for the restaurant.  I had a #1 and the person I was eating with had flat enchiladas.  If this is the best Phoenix has to offer, I feel bad for anyone living here.  The food lacked flavor, the green chili sauce tasted like they opened a can and poured it on top.  Beans and rice were not good at all.  The sopapillas were good, but that is not hard to mess up.  Also way overpriced for what you get.    Do yourself a favor, and find another restaurant.  Not worth your time.

Growing up in Tucson, I often have a craving for Mexican food.  I have tried many places throughout the valley and Rositas is great.  The food is cheap and is consistent.  I typically get the taco/enchilada combo, or a green chile chimi.  The margaritas are also pretty good.  I also always ask for the hot sauce with my chips and salsa.  I can't give it 5 stars because I have had better Mexican food, but this is the best I have had in the Phoenix area so far.

By far the best middle eastern restaurant in Tempe.  Everything from the baklava to the chicken scharama is wonderful.  By go to dish is the felafel plate.  I like the very causal atmosphere and the fact that you can browse the grocery aisles while you wait for your food.  I usually do take out, but have eaten lunch in the restaurant a few times.

Yuck.  That was a wasted groupon, at least I did not pay full price for this place.  I will never return to this place.  Slow service, food was bland, and was way overpriced.    The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because of the interior.  I think the space itself creates a nice atmosphere.  I had the Agnolotti Boa, a ravioli dish.  Unfortunately for $16 this left me hungry and craving some flavor.  I appreciate the use of fresh and organic ingredients, but this just lacked everything.    There are better options in neighboring Scottsdale or even in Tempe.  Skip this place.

This place is now my favorite restaurant to go to in Vegas.  Awesome food at reasonable prices.  Skip the buffets and get some food that is worth the money. The assortment of breads they bring out pre-entree was also a nice touch.  I ate the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash.  This was a great choice and was the best hash I have eaten.  The amount of spice was just right.  Not too spicy, but enough to let you know that you were eating at a southwestern restaurant.  The service was great as well.  I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant

Tried this place because of a groupon.  Good thing it was at a discount, because it was not worth the money.  While the location and building are very authentic and unique for the area, that is about all this place has going for it.  I can't give a mexican restaurant a good review when they charge for chips and salsa, especially when the salsa is below average.  I ordered the smoked chicken enchiladas and was disappointed.  First the waitress messed up my order.  I clearly said I wanted the beans and rice, this is a mexican restaurant, right?  For some reason my mexican food comes out with grilled seasonal vegetables and black beans.  Umm...ok.  I didn't complain, bc I didn't want to wait any longer for my food.  But this is definitely a first.  Overall, the enchiladas lacked flavor and the tortillas were hard.    I will not return.

Went for an early dinner around 5:30 last Saturday and was really pleased with the experience.  The restaurant has a contemporary feel and plays a good selection of music.  The chicken sandwiches are great, in particular the rosemary chicken sandwich.  Thankfully they give you an entire pitcher of water, because their glasses are very small, as they are trying to keep up with the contemporary feel in every respect.  But service was great.  I was a little disappointed with the side salad that comes with the dish, as the dressing was not that appealing.  I didn't like the fact you had to pay $2 extra for fries instead.  However, overall I would return and would recommend this restaurant.

Wasted my $40.  This place seemed great after reading about it online.  Unfortunately, unless you eat the king crab legs, the rest of the food is not worth eating.  And because I don't eat seafood, I was quite disappointed.  While everyone raves about the crab legs, I would like to judge the buffet based on its prime rib.  The cuts of prime rib I had were very fatty.  Not top quality.  the cheeses tasted like they had been left out for a while and tasted stale.  The pastas were not very good.  Needless to say, nothing really impressed me to even write about.   The desserts were good, but not worth spending the $40 on.  I loaded up on these since I was still hungry from not eating much that was very appealing.  The service for drinks was also bad.  I got up and helped myself to more iced tea.

Great atmosphere and great food.  I ate dessert after eating at what was once open, Trader Vics.  The dessert here was great.  I had the special, the chocolate satin pie.  This was a very good choice.  I will come back here for dinner in the near future.

This is one of my favorite restaurants in the area.  Went for an anniversary and the general manager personally set up a tasting menu.  It was the best service I have ever received, and the food was outstanding as always.  The duck and the beef tenderloin are excellent.  Don't forget the coconut sorbet and maybe a mai tai.  Highly recommend.

This place is awesome!  I had the sampler platter, and wow...I couldn't even finish it all.  It was so much food.  The ribs were good, and the chicken was good....but when I go back, I am sticking to the brisket and the pulled pork.  The brisket and pulled pork are the best I have eaten in AZ, and I have tried a lot of places.  The coleslaw and the macaroni salad was very good as well.  Really can't go wrong with any of the sides.  Make sure to get a coca-cola cake for dessert.  It was amazing.  Definitely try this place out if you are looking for an inexpensive barbecue joint that will fill you up!

Tried this place after getting a groupon.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  The location is not the best, but what was lacking in appearance, certainly made up for it with the food that was served.  The decor inside of the restaurant is very well put together.  Somewhat, a kind of modern mexican feel.    I ordered the Cola and Pineapple Soy Braised Angus Short Rib Roast.  A great choice that I will definitely order again.  The meat was so tender and melted in your mouth.  The spices were spot on.  I paired it with the green chili cornbread casserole and chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes.  Both of which were amazing.  My fiance had the pernil asado.  This was also very good, but was not my favorite of the two.  Although, I don't really eat pork.  Overall, I would definitely recommend.  If you plan on going, get reservations, or you might end up having to sit at the bar.  Its a small place.  Sometimes so busy that they never answer their phone (something they can probably improve on).

Came here on a work lunch and was very impressed.  Nice atmosphere, attentive service and very flavorful food.  Had the green chile burger and was one of the best burgers I have had.  I will likely skip the salad next time, but can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu.

Atmosphere is great, but the service was subpar.  The tables next to us were offered samples of margaritas and overall seemed to have better service.  We will likely not return, expenisve food which was average at best.

I wish I could give this place 0 stars, because that is what it deserves.  I only lived here for 3 months and I feel so lucky that it was a short term lease.    Lets see...  The worst problem was the roaches.  Absolutely disgusting.  I had to call them at least 3-4 times, and gave up on them fixing the problem.  I just decided to put borax acid down to fix it myself.  While it did temporarily, they never completely went away.  This place needs to fumigate the entire building.  Absolutely disgusting.    The trash shoots were also a major gripe.  In the summer the garbage wasn't emptied enough and reeked of rotten food and garbage.  Thats ok, they decided to spray a disgusting scent to try and cover up the problem.  Just made it worse.  Just about everything in the apartment was broke when I moved in..  None of the outlets worked and had to be replaced.  The door handle was basically impossible to open each morning.  The bathtub had sludge that would come up almost on a weekly basis.  The sliding glass door wouldn't lock and had to be adjusted.  Within that time frame my car probably had about 100 door dings from their inadequate parking.  Luckily I then switched to a covered parking, which was built too low and would hit my antennae each time I entered or  exited.  Stay away...  Everything in the complex seemed to be broken as well.  The bbqs were pretty much broken all summer...how convenient.  The hot tub was also broken most of the time.  Also someone graffiti-ed a explicit profanity in the hallway one week and is pretty much still visible.

After eating at Roscoes Chicken and Waffles in LA, I was dying to try this place.  This place is different than Roscoes, but definitely would give them a run for their money.    The location is ok, convenient for the old town crowd.  Nothing special about the building or interior though.    When the food came out I was pleasantly surprised.  The chicken was nice and crispy and nice and moist on the inside.  The waffles are really what set Lo-Los apart from the rest.  The hints of cinnamon make these waffles special, and left me wanting more after I devoured all of them.   I also ordered a sweet tea, a great offering that every restaurant should have.    Definitely try this place out if you have not done so already!

This place is great.  Family owned and operated.  The mechanics are the owner and his son, and the wife works the office.  I went there this Saturday, because I needed a quick oil change while in town, and because they had great reviews and a killer deal at $18.    I basically pull up and right into the lane.  I hop out, the owner gets my info, and in less than 10 minutes I paid and was on my way.    By far the fastest oil change I have ever had, and they don't try to sell you a million services like jiffy lube.

I had high hopes for this restaurant.  However, they ended once I was greeted at the door by a very unfriendly hostess.  I had a reservation and had made it over a week in advance.  Well, we arrive 10 minutes prior and are seated at a table that was very awkwardly placed, and literally a foot away from what would be another couple.  I asked to be moved, as we wanted more privacy than this, and there were many other open tables.  However, our request was not granted.    So fine, we tried to make the most of it.  However, this was then followed up by a very unfriendly waitress, who went right along with hostess' attitude.  The food was very good, and over priced.   I would say, go if you are getting a good deal on happy hour wine, but stick to wine and skip the food.  Maybe a place just for drinks, but even then, the wine list was not all that impressive, and I would recommend going down the street to Kazimierz or Postino's.

This place is a very unique place close to downtown Phoenix.  I have eaten here 3 times, and each time it has been amazing.  The atmosphere is cozy and eclectic at the same time. The mac and cheese is one of my favorite dishes.  However, the sandwiches are very good and are relatively inexpensive for what you get.  I also enjoy their potato chips, as these were really good quality kettle style chips.  The happy hour is also great, and they have a wide assortment of AZ beers and wines and great prices.  Definitely recommend this place.

I hate giving places such low reviews, but this place deserves it.    I went here on a Friday night around 7 and my party was the only table in the restaurant.  To be fair, there were several people in the bar area, but still, this is also a restaurant.  Anyway, I had high hopes for this place.  When you walk in the decor is very nice, and has an inviting, contemporary feel.  The wait staff is also very friendly and almost immediately brought out some of their plantains and dipping sauce.  This was a great start, but that basically ended when I bit into the plantain.  They were pretty much flavorless and really lacked the correct consistency.    We then started with a couple of martinis.  This was something that they are known for.  They were decent, but I think it is really hit or miss with their drinks.  I have had way better, for way cheaper.  I ordered the Threesome, which was not very good. I wouldn't recommend this drink, even though it is highly recommended by the bartenders and waitstaff.  I tasted 2 others, both of which were not outstanding at $9.  For that price, I expect better quality.  Moving on to the main dish.  To be fair, I didn't order the latin flavored cuisine, but I really wasn't feeling it after tasting the plantains.  I ordered a the green chili burger.  Where to start with this one.  I ordered it medium-well, and the burger basically came out burnt.  On top of that, I tasted no green chilis, and the bun was basically a something I could go down to the super market to get.  Maybe the latin food is better, but I will let other people find that out.  Also, they messed up my friend's order, however, we were so hungry we didn't want to send it back or mention it.  The fries were very good.  I really enjoyed the sweet potato fries and that is the only thing I enjoyed while eating here.    I wouldn't recommend eating at this restaurant.  There is much better in Scottsdale.   They do have a decent happy hour though, which may be the only reason I would ever return.

Went here last week for dinner and was pleasantly surprised.  We walked in and the hostess was very friendly and informed us that there was about 10 minutes left on happy hour and that they had some great drink specials.  We went to the bar while waiting for a table, and were immediately served, even though it was busy, as it was Friday around 7pm.  We ordered 2 margaritas, which came out to $7 on happy hour.  Great start!  We then were seated shortly after.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with blue cheese, and it was very good.  The fries were great as well.  Not a gourmet burger, but very large and tasty.  Better than your average sports bar burger.  Service was very good as well.  We always had a full glass even when it was packed.  They even changed the game to UofA for the pac-10 championship when requested.

I absolutely love this place.  I eat at the one in Tucson a lot as well.  But this location is great.   The Zinburger or the Kobe Burger are great options.  The meat is very tender and is definitely a gourmet type burger.  Also the truffle fries are amazing.  This place has an amazing happy hour as well.  Highly recommend if you are looking for a good burger!

One of my favorite restaurants in Tempe.  I have tried a couple of the ramens, but the Republic and chili pepper are my go-to favorites.  I usually order the ramen with traditional toppings, but both selections of toppings are great.  I also enjoy the good selection of bobas.  The prices are also pretty reasonable and if you are looking for ramen this is the place to try.

Great neighborhood coffee shop.  This place serves great coffee and food that is inviting for any person...meaning, you don't have to be a hipster to sit and enjoy a cup at this place.  Also the prices are much cheaper than the Starbucks down the road, and are of a much higher quality.  Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a place to study or grab a quick coffee on the go.  The lattes are great!

I will not return to this place.  I went here for a business lunch and I guess I didn't understand the restaurant's concept.  I appreciate all of the items being under 520 calories, but I want my food to taste good and fill me up at the same time.  Because of this, I asked the waitress what the most filling item on the menu was.  This was the grilled chicken caesar sandwich.  Not very good and kind of smelled like rubber.  Anyway, maybe this place is better for dinner, but I wont return.  I do like their idea of having a seasonal menu though.  They switch the menu out for fall, winter, spring, and summer.  Good idea.

I really like this restaurant.  It has the unfortunate disadvantage in being in a really bad loacation, the Esplanade is really only commercial offices now, and is not really a great place for foot traffic and parking.  Nevertheless, this restaurant is worth parking in the garage and trying out.    The decor is a great place to stop and get a drink.  There are several tvs and always has some decent music playing in the background.  I must say that if I did not have a groupon here, I would probably give this place 3 stars, as it is a little overpriced for tacos.  I have eaten several items here  the pernil asado tacos, short rib barbacoa, and the nachos.  Personally, my favorite item is the short rib barbacoa.  The spices are a great mixture and the meat is very moist and tender.   The pernil asado is good, but not my favorite.  The nachos are a good choice for a lot of food.  But they are really known for the tacos.  The chips and salsa are also really good.  Overall, I will return to this place, but definitely not the best tacos in the country.  Good but not the best.

We were looking for a nice place to have breakfast/lunch on a Sunday morning.  After walking by this restaurant the day before and seeing everyone waiting in line, we decided to give it a try the next day.  This was a big mistake.  While I expect to pay high prices in Vegas for food, I also expect to get better quality.  This restaurant certainly was lacking in quality.  I ordered the french dip with hush puppies.  The french dip was one of the worst I have ever had.  Bland, to say the least.  Arby's would have been a better choice.  My guest had a traditional breakfast, and also was not impressed.  Skip this place.

My wife and I frequent this neighborhood frozen yogurt place.  My favorite is peanut butta, but most of the flavors are pretty good.  There are so many toppings that you can choose from, each creating a different flavor.  My only complaint would be that they need to rotate the flavors more often.  I went months without seeing the peanut butta as a selection.  Also, the fact that they have dairy free is a huge selling point, albeit they usually only have two selections to choose from, and these are typically the fruit flavored options.

We came here with a groupon, not really knowing what to expect with the food.  We were not expecting much, but were very impressed by the dishes.  We started with an order of wings.  Very unique way of serving these, as the wing had both the drumette and the wingette left attached as one piece.  They were crisp and just the right level of spice.  We then had a burger and a buffalo chicken sandwich.  Both were great options.  We had the deviled egg salad and the brussel sprout slaw.  Unique and tasty sides.  We will definitely come back to watch a game sometime, as the food is much better than the typical bar.

Tacos are good.  I recommend going on a Tuesday, so you can get more bang for your buck as many of the tacos are half off.  Unique and flavortul margaritas.  I ordered one of the chile ones and it was very tasty.

We were very excited to try this restaurant for der, but unfortunately left very disappointed.  First it took approximately 20 minutes to get menus, and this took me going up to the hostess station to get myself.  You should probably order more menus if your hostess is not able to provide when she seats a customer.  After we ordered, we waited close to an hour for our food to arrive.  Yes, it was a Friday, but hardly "busy" in comparison to any other restaurant.  Most people decided that the wait wasn't worth it and left.  The food when it arrived was below average.  I ordered the burger, which I figured would be quick and hard to mess up.  Unfortunately half the toppings I ordered were missing and I wasn't about to wait another hour for it to be corrected.  My date's pork sandwich was average, but I wouldn't order again if given the opportunity.  The fries were cold.  Other items on the menu sounded more appealing, but for the location and type of restaurant, way too expensive.   $15 for an entree is too high for the area and quality, and I doubt too many people would be willing to order those entrees after waiting 20 minutes before receiving a menu.  Also, $7 for a craft pint is twice the price of anywhere else in the area.    Overall, a 2 hour dining experience not by choice.  Unfortunately, I will not return.  This was the second time I have been to this restaurant and it is the second time I have left disappointed.  I would have been willing to try again if a manager was willing to make customary rounds and apologize to customers for the horrible service (every table around us was complaining about the hour long wait for food to get to the table).

We arrived about 40 minutes before they opened and waited in line, patiently taking in the aroma of all of the barbequed meats.  Once we got inside the shop, we were given a sample of the brisket.  By far the best brisket I have ever eaten in Arizona, and it would rival, if not superseded many of the briskets in Texas.  We ordered a sample of each meat as we could not choose.  My personal favorite was the lean brisket, but most people seemed to love the fatty brisket.  The sausage was also spectacular.  We also had a few pork ribs.  We will certainly be back again when we are craving some authentic barbeque.

Came here on a Saturday night for our weekly date night.  We sat outside on the patio and received quick service.  Very friendly staff.  The food was amazing.  We had one of the specials, which was venison and bone marrow, with romanesco.  We also ordered the open face meatloaf sandwich.  Both were great, creative dishes.  It is great seeing a chef who takes so much pride in the food he prepares, even when it is meatloaf (which was no ordinary meatloaf).  Every dish that cam out of the kitchen looked unique and we will be back to try more.   I would highly recommend this restaurant.

Have driven past this restaurant a few time, but decided to give it a try when we bought a Groupon.  We were very happy with our dishes.  They took a long time to come out, but the food was very good.  Nice atmosphere.
