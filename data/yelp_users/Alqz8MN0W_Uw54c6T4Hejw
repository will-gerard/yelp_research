We live 1.5 miles from this location. We thought, hey! let's get it delivered!  Ha. Yeah right. They won't deliver to us... literally... it's less than 5 mins away!!!  WE are outside of their range. Ridiculous.  So we sent someone to go pick up. OK sure. Sandwiches were extremely bland...only white bread, no flavor, and they didn't put sprouts on any of the sandwiches we ordered. Can't fill a simple order.  Best part was the chips.  Will not order from them again, neither dine -in or delivery... cause yeah... they wont come to us, awesome... not.  Don't waste your time or money.

We went during the first week it was open. We LOVE Windsor and Postino's so we really wanted to try out their new spot! The food... DELICIOUS! WE had the veggie board, and the sweet potato pizza. Both were great! I loved the food. :) The hostesses didn't seem to be on the same page though. We had one tell us we would be in a booth, and ask if we needed a high-chair, another come after to take us to our seats outside at a table, for 4 (we were a group of 5)  and again, ask us if we needed a high chair.  I will let all that slide since it was their first week. One other suggestion though.... Bike rack! Great location for bikers, but no place to lock up!  Also it seems kinda odd that there is no entrance from the street.   Overall, great food! Can't wait to go back and try some other pizzas!
