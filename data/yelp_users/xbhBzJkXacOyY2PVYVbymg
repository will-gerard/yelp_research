Came here on a Monday and it was $1 game and $1 shoe rental. Can't really beat that and the ambience is actually nicer than most bowling alleys I went to.

This place is usually busy and there's probably only 1-3 servers working so waiting can take awhile. Which is probably why I'm giving it 4 stars. Other than that, the kbbq is pretty good. My gf got the teriyaki chicken, which is probably one of the best one I have had. They usually have AYCE kbbq, but it's selective on odd days of the week. $20 for kbbq and $25 for sushi and kbbq. The next one is April 18 & 28. They have karaoke rooms and all day $5 sake bombers! You can't really beat that. If the service was faster this place would definitely get 5 stars!

$14 for lunch + $2 drinks for mediocre selections and bland food. Not really worth the price for the quality of food.

Had the orange chicken lunch box and I have to say it's probably the worst orange chicken I had yet. It's drench in this "orange" sauce that didn't even taste like orange flavor and the crab puff wasn't even that good. It reminds me of cardboard. The pot stickers were average which is why I'm giving it a 2 stars.

The macarons here are pretty good. One of the best ones here in the valley. They have a lot of selections of drinks and everything taste so good. Friendly service and place is very trendy.

1 star is very generous for this shady dealership.   I was interested in a 2016 Subaru STI on Friday and requested a "blow out" price and was contacted by Doug through e-mail. After several exchange emails about my upside down trade and the price of the vehicle, I wanted to know the financed amount. He informed me that I would have to come in for a full evaluation. Fair enough, so I stopped by after work and worked on the numbers. The trade value they gave me was a little lower than I expected and they weren't willing to lower the price of the STI because it was a "hot item" or give me more on the trade to compensate. I told them it's no deal; I'll think about it and left.   After thinking about it over the weekend, I called Doug that Monday and stated we can closed the deal if they lowered it another $500 and if they can get me the color in white or blue. He said the blue was sold over the weekend, but he might have one coming in and stated he will call me back, but failed to follow up. I called back after a couple hours and he said he is still looking into with his inventory manager. Right, because it takes anyone that long to look up a car within their lot. 5 hours passed and he finally calls and said that he just got a blue one and that I would need to come back for a reappraisal of the trade in. I figured the value wouldn't change, but I was wrong. Not only did they dropped my trade 1k less than what they originally quoted, but they also increased the price of the car. Making it overall 2k more than anticipated.   I asked them why did they quote me a higher amount 2 days ago and their reason was because they didn't do a "full" appraisal on it at the time. That's some unethical business practices and poor customer service on Camelback and I'm surprised they're still in business. The whole time I was there, Doug never approached me or greeted me, but instead had his "minions" do the dirty work for him. The whole sales people are all out there to steal and rip you off. Overall, my experience was a waste of time, constantly lied to, and tried to lure me into a regrettable purchase.   Don't waste your time on this garbage dealership.

I went there today with a few friends from work and I have to say I am quite disappointed. I got the 2 piece drum and thigh combo with Japanese bbq and it comes with 1 donut and a side. The donut I had was a maple bacon and the side was corn stir fry. The donut was ok, but the bacon was dry like salad bacon bits. I took a bite on the corn and I was done. Now time for the main dish, the chicken. The Japanese bbq had a weird kick to it and the chicken itself was raw and had some blood on the meat...ugh. I could barely finished it and the meal came out to around $11. It was totally not worth it and you're better off eating at Popeyes for better chicken for half the price.
