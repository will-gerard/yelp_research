Always had to wait 20-30 mins after booked appointment. Medical assistance never asked, "How is your day?" or "How have you been?" Worst patient treatment. They never seem to keep things on record for the life of them. I came with my mom only for a referral for a skin doctor and have already waited 20 mins to get taken back, find out they don't have her record, and then placed back into the waiting lobby for another 30 mins. I am very glad to be at another doctor. Luckily this will my moms last visit here. We are very unhappy with the way we have been treated.

This place is beautiful!! Great dessert scenic views!! Staff is very nice and helpful!! If I had a problem, they were right there instantly! This complex is awesome on community events!!! Pool parties (which is a huge Olympic size pool!), trunk or treat, Easter egg hunts, and plenty more!! It is a great way to have everyone together and have have a lot of fun! It is very close to the anthem outlets, if you love shopping like me!! :) Also very close to a full shopping center and Anthem community park!
