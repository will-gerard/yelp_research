I came here when I first moved to Phoenix from the east coast. The owner did my mails beautifully. The problem I had is when I changed the color I noticed the new fill on my acrylics was yellow. When I went to get filled at another shop, an months later I noticed that the fill from this shop was still yellow and getting worse. As my nails grew out, you could see when I came to Wendy's nail salon, and eventually that is where they started breaking. I eventually just paid for a whole new set from my new nail girl Tran at DV Nails.. I likes Wendy and how they looked but the poor product the salon used ruined my nails for months.

Truly happy with the decision to visit this office. My back was killing me and I couldn't stand up straight from moving homes over the last few weeks. The doctor took the time to explain to me what was going on with my back pain, how to prevent in the future, and some stretches to do at home to help with the healing process. I was in and out quickly and it's only been a day and I can feel the healing has begun. I have found my new chiropractor!! Other chiropractors I have seen are pushing things that will just run up my insurance bill. I feel this doctor is all about solution and healing. I will be back, and since I work down the road I have already started referring my coworkers. Thanks so much!! 6 stars!! Much!!

I lost my steady nail girl of three years when she moved. I tried Angel Nails, and Katie and her husband both took care of me. I'm in love with my nails and they found a loyal customer in me!

Great staff! They know my order. Super friendly and delicious drinks!! I recommend the macchiato. They have a rewards points program, and you can CALL AHEAD YOUR ORDERS!! This is great for when you are running late. Love this place. I haven't been to Starbucks since we moved to the area. Thanks Bold Roost!!

First time to this shop, my husband and I love to work with Greg and we followed him here to this shop. It's quiet and clean, and I love the privacy you have with your artist. Words can not express the talent Greg has from initial conception, drawings and edits, placement and brilliant color. Greg's expertise helps me make the best decisions for my body and he works with any existing ink. He makes you comfortable and his work continues to stand the test of time. He does cover ups too!!  Since my visit my husband has been back to the shop, and I'm already thinking about my next session. I am impressed with the shop in Mesa, and I am excited to watch this shop grow!
