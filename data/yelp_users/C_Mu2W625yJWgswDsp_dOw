What a great place!  Edward is amazing and fantastic with kids!  Hot towel, massage, and a great haircut! Let me tell you my 5 yr old was so happy!  Very professional and modern!  Highly recommend for men!  Getting my husband in for a clean shave!

Best Service!  We have been here over 15 times and have had great service and incredible sushi.  They are always friendly and go out of their way to be nice to our 3 yr old son.

If I could give it a no star I would.  Who wants to sweat while you eat.  I don't care what the food and beer is like.  Turn on the AC ! It's 110 out!

The only reason 1 star can be given is the flavor choices and taste.  The SMALLEST wings I have ever seen, they must be off of baby chicks.  I thought it was getting punked, actually LOL.  Never to be back

Great service and food.  I had the Greek salad with lamb......one of the best I've had.  The hummus was great as well.  Fresh ingredients, friendly staff and great atmosphere!

This was my first visit, I was lucky enough to book an apt with Sally!  She colored and cut my hair perfectly! Great vibe! Tequila Thursdays! They are open 9am till 10pm! This is now my salon! Anyone looking for a place that will finally get it right, look no further!

If results and a high energy fun workout is what you are looking for, you will not find a better spot.  Jennifer is amazing and inspirational, encourages you to do your best!  How she remembers everyone's name is amazing!!  I havent had the same routine yet!  I have lost 6 lbs!  On my 3rd week!  Working out outside is amazing, isn't that why we live in AZ??  Couldn't be more happier that I found this great group to workout with.  I truly look forward to it every morning!!

I new it would be a fun night as soon as I walked into this place!  Great upscale atmosphere.  Makes bowling fun!  Huge screen TVs at the end of each lane.  The menu and food is great! Service was fantastic, never waited for anything.  We had a group of 10 and we all had a great experience!

had the Florentine omlette, my son the bacon and cheese... He ended up devouring mine:). Soooo good, the shoestring hash browns are ridiculous!!! Best hash browns anywhere! Even the jelly is homemade and amazing. The coffee blows anyplace out of the water! In other words everything that we had was incredible. Best new find!
