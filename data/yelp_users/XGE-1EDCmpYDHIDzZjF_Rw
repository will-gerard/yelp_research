Our pets have been patients of Kennel care for over 13 years. They have seen us through a restorative surgery after our little Buddy had been attacked. He suffered from what we thought was allergies or sinus infection or worse a tumor. He was very tired,  wasn't eating, we really thought he was on his way to the other side. After weighing options we had Dr. Lind perform a procedure that truly gave us back our Buddy! They have boarded our dogs for us on several occasions and they have always taken excellent care of them.  They groom our Buddy each time needed, as always excellent service! Most recently they spade our little Miss Kyra. I had my fears as she is a bit older, once again Excellent care! They called the next day to check on her, and me too :) I realized after watching her sleep they took the time to trim her nails (a task we struggle with) without me asking them. I feel our furry kiddos are well cared for by the staff at Kennel Care and we recommend these folks to each of our animal loving friends and family.

So husband and I decided to try a new place, wow disappointing. They served him chicken with what tasted like canned cream of chicken soup poured over it, cold mashed potatoes & mushy vegetables. I had the pizza it was alright, wine was good (had to ask for Moscato not on wine menu) the booth next to us looked like there was a mob hit, big hole. The paint was peeling from the ceiling from water damage. I ordered a slice of the cheesecake to go, got home and found it to be unetible! Completely dried out must have been in the refrigerator for about a week. Sadly disappointed.

Tried a different location today, 'delightful' experience. I did not have an appointment which wasn't an issue I was seated promptly after selecting a polish. Brian gently removed my existing acrylic and expertly applied a clean new full set. He listened carefully to my preferences and exceeded my expectations. Very happy with the shape, thickness, and NO nicks or cuts on the cuticles!  Lovely, clean salon plenty of stations and spa chairs. The employees appeared to follow a well established process of sterilization and sanitation. I watched as they washed their own hands before and after each client. I've been to several salons that claim great sanitation, Delightful Nails actually executes it!  I will return when ready for a fill and will try a pedi next visit.
