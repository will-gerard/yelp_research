Good food not the nicest atmosphere but if you're looking for good Chinese food at lunch this is a good choice. Know what you want and don't ask anything about making a change to how a dish is served and you will be fine.

Awesome fish and chips. Big portions and friendly staff. If your doing take out call ahead it will be much quicker. Try the shrimp they are huge and fresh.

Was craving Chinese and Wongs is being remodeled so went just next door to this place. Upon opening g the front door I was hit with an odor only comparable to the odor in alley used by the homeless to urinate. Could not make it to the second door before I became nauseous and lost the craving as well as my appetite.

I started seeing Dr. Steve almost 2 years ago and when I did my back had gotten so bad I could hardly turn my head from side to side. I called and left a message on a holiday asking for a appointment on his voice mail. I received a call back later the same day and was in his office the following morning.  After some quick x-rays and a gentle adjustment I could actually move my head without feeling like I was going to die. 2 more adjustments later that week and I was pain free and moving better than I had in years. Now my whole family sees Dr. Steve and we could not be happier with his care and true concern about our well being and quality of life. A little maintenance and the occasional tune up and we are performing at our peak not just barely getting by.

Dr. Steve is a life saver. I walked in after two nights of hardly being able to walk. After 10 minutes of Amber loosening my lower back up with massage Dr Steve was able to get me back into alignment and the pain is gone. Thanks Dr Steve I appreciate all of your care and concern.

Dr. Steve is getting my wife and son back in peak condition. Helps my son play at peak levels on his football team and have to have my wife in top shape to keep me in line.

Great quality produce and fresh meat. I buy all my ribs there for BBQ competitions and have never been disappointed.  Great selection of dry goods and spices. Don't expect to get in and out quick as they are always busy.

This place use to be the best. Their food was awesome but now they have opened a new location in Gilbert it is like they just abandoned this store. Quality has gone down hill and the service is awful.

These people are great. Awesome selection very competitive pricing and Julie is a gem. She is always friendly and willing to help. If your looking to buy a new or used gun this is the place to go. They have a great selection of almost any kind of gun you are looking for weather it be pistol rifle or shotgun.  They have law enforcement trade in you can get a awesome deal on as well. Don't buy until you check here.

Best Pizza hands down with the best service and nicest people you could ask for. More than willing to cook my own to get this kind of quality.

This has to be the only Dairy Queen I have ever been to that is out of bananas more often than not. I mean seriously isn't Dairy Queen supposed to be the home of the banana split. I would recommend the kids on the corner selling lemonaide before I would this place.

Pizza is fantastic and has to have one of the most fun group of employees I've ever been to. Price is very reasonable for the great quality and it doesn't get any fresher than this.

Food is excellent and they have a great variety to choose from. The service quick and friendly. Hopefully they will do so well they will have to expand as this location is a little small. We will definitely be coming back.
