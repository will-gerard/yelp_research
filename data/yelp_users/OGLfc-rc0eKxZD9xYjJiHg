Love the sizzling fajitas.  You must select the carnitas as your meat choice.  Then, top it off with an ice cold dos XX s beer in a frosted mug.  Also really good sangria swirl margaritas.

Course is beautiful.  Super friendly staff and ranger.  Only $50 for a round of 18.  Restaurant here too but it's really busy today so opted to go down the road.  It must be a good restaurant.

Hour and a half wait.  Ugh.  Still waiting for food.  I imagine it's not easy to manage people no-showing for work but yikes.  Bathrooms are dirty and run down.  Please get me out of here.

Great ambiance. Wow, my boyfriend brought me here for Valentine's Day. It is very unique and the food is really good.  Homemade fresh bread with cilantro , basil and onion. I thought that was the weirdest thing ever but it was so good!!!  Reasonably priced.

Love this course and golf there frequently. It's a long 18,  straight, forgiving  and It's always kept so nice!   It's also a great place to have breakfast!

Dropped by discount tire in Tempe with no appointment and got my car in immediately. They fixed a slow leak that I've had for the last month and sent me on my way at no charge. It doesn't get any better than that. And they are always so fast and friendly!

Love this place!  Awesome band, great fish and chips and car bombs.  How did I live in Tempe 30 years and miss this!  Yahoo!  Shake and bake.

Finally a vegan restaurant in Tempe!  I love their food.  They have a vegan breakfast burrito with bacon (tofu bacon that is), carrots, cabbage, sweet potatoes, tofu, cauliflower. I know, it sounds a little weird, but it is really good.  They also have lunches, juices and vegan desserts.

I eat here at least three times a week. They have the best salads under the sun and their bread is always so good. Try the chopped salmon salad or the Mediterranean salad, those two are my favorite.  The restaurant is always busy which is a pain but it's always clean. And they have outdoor seating.

The vine on Elliot Road is my favorite place to go for Stein night every Thursday night.  Really good wings and burgers.  And ice cold beer

My boyfriend liked his breakfast.  Great view watching all the planes take off.  Patio setting is great.  My food and coffee was cold.  But then it's an airport.    Prices are very reasonable. I'll eat before I come next time.

Yep, it was scary.   We went in the middle of the week and had to wait 45 minutes but it was worth it.  We were taken in groups of 6 and of course I was pushed to the front of our group and I was the most scared.  I finally started screaming as I approached each corner we were about to round because I knew something or someone was going to jump out or drop from the ceiling.  Favorite scares were the snake belly we went through and the chain saw massacurist that jumped out of the ceiling.  It felt like we were in the house for about 45 minutes.  I came out with a hoarse voice from all my screaming and sweating.  Scary!

I went there for the first time today. My sister referred me because she bought a package there. I went in and had an adjustment today for $19 and I feel so much better. They did recommend that I come back for five or six different treatments. So, I'm not sure I need that but I have to say it was clean I like the doctor the receptionist was friendly and I will go back

Have been taking all my pets here for 30 years. They always give the best quality care. Sometimes they are a little slow but today is an exception. Hooray!

This place is amazing. It's a beautiful Saturday morning or sitting out here having a wonderful breakfast dogs next to us and it's packed in here.  Did I mention that they have really good mimosas?

I did not have a good experience here. I thought it was expensive for a very basic pedicure at $25. Then the pedicure was only about 20 minutes.   They rushed through everything and didn't take off cuticles and short cut it on the nail polish. Sure enough the following day that started to chip already.  When I went to check out they said they didn't want to take credit cards so I had to write a check. And the sign also said tips have to be cash.  Playing on the television was the UFC fights. There were only five people in there when I was there but they were all women and I doubt that was what they wanted to watch. It was on for  the person standing at the front desk which was a man. The nail technicians were dressed in jeans and Jean shorts.  There was no music on in the salon and it was so interesting that no one was talking at all. Usually the nail techs are jabbering back-and-forth but it was just kind of a bad energy that day.   I see others have left some five-star reviews so perhaps I was there on a bad day for them. Everybody gets to have their bad day.

I've been here about five times now. This is close to home and oh my gosh you should see the view. It is a huge beautiful bar and restaurant that sits right on the water.  You have to go visit!

Hosted my company's 10 year anniversary party at this restaurant. Rave reviews by everyone that attended.   wondering where this best-kept secret came from.  Right on the water and the coolest lay out ever. We had over 300 people and only used up one side of the restaurant.  Great service and so accommodating to our group

This is a Mexican restaurant that has a full size swimming pool right in the backyard. Girl sitting out there in their bathing suits. We came here before he went to Gammage Theatre for the night and it's totally casual with a mixture of business people and students and super cool.

Super fun golfing. It's outside and it's a bar atmosphere. There are misters and band and it feels really good out here even on a hot summer night.  We are having tails beer and food along with brain golf game. All the golf balls of chips in them and they're automatically scored and it makes it fun even if you're not a great golfer
