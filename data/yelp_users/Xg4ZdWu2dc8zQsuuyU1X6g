I have been living in the valley for over 20 years and I can confidently say that Shaw Butte Barbers are the best in the business! They are on the quiet side, which I love, but man they are great at what they do! Do yourself a favor and purchase the shave as well! You will thank me later!

I want to like this place so bad! The staff is usually pretty friendly, the atmosphere is great, the DJ plays great music, but the wait time to get your food is the worst in the business! I have been to LO-LO's on 3 different occasions and have NEVER received my order in under 1 hour!!! I hope the owners can turn this around. I can't recommend this place in the mean time.

Best BBQ in town hands down!!!!!! Great staff met with great meat cuts..... It's a win win! Do yourself a favor and get the brisket moist!
