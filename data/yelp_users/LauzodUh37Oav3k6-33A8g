Had to take the greyhound from LA to Phoenix, and was pretty unhappy with both stations to be honest, this one in particular was just really dirty, and getting help or info about your bus was all but impossible, which is ironic because there really aren't that many people at the station looking to get help or waiting to talk to staff. It just seems like everyone is doing the bare minimum to get their jobs done and no one really cares about you or helping you.   I guess on the bright side, there's a food stand/somewhere you can buy some food if you need it.

Came here on my last day of a trip to Phoenix, and was surprisingly blown away! What I thought would just be some random Japanese place for dinner ended up not only being great, but also a great value! We ordered mostly from the happy hour menu, which was 5PM-9PM Monday-Friday, which gave us a bunch of rolls, and even tempura for ~$5.   The d√©cor and staff here are also great and you really feel like you're eating at a much more upscale restaurant than the cost would have you think. Will definitely come by again for a meal when I'm around the area.

Just your standard Denny's but the fact that the staff is generally very polite, they have free wifi and are open 24 hours a day, and are not stingy and don't care if you stick around to study and do work, I have to give this place a pretty solid rating.  The food itself is all standard Denny's menu, I can't complain about the food but I really can't say that they made it any better than Denny's anywhere else.   Come here to hang with friends, come here to get some work done, the staff is great and won't bother you and accommodates you when you need to hang out for a bit even after your food is done,

I noticed that the owner/manager of Bobby Q is frequently on this yelp page, so I really hope he gets to this review because I had a fantastic dinner at Bobby Q's Sunday night. The food, ambience, and everything was great, but what really set this place over the top for me was our server, Anthony.  So if the staff over at Bobby Q's ever reads this, I just want to let them know how impressed I was with Anthony's service(enough to toss him a $10 tip on a $20 check, it'd be more but a starving student can only give so much haha). He was not only attentive and helpful but was very friendly throughout the night. Coming by at the most opportune times to offer us water refills, extra sauce(warmed sauce, fancy!), and even suggested different items on the menu that he thought we'd like better(which we did!) Such a great guy and really made a huge difference in our dining experience.  So if you ever get the chance to stop by Bobby Q's, ask for Anthony and toss him a huge tip as a thank you after you have one of the greatest dining experiences of your life!  Haha.  All that aside, the food at Bobby Q's was great as well. We got the three meat combo with Beef Ribs(great), Baby back ribs(my personal favorite), and beef brisket(a tad bit dry, but still good) with Mac and cheese(amazing!) and shoestring fries(also good) as the sides. Everything was great, and the fact that we didn't have to wait an hour like at other BBQ places was another huge plus as well. The food came quick, was piping hot, and they even split it onto two plates for us because I was splitting the food.  At the end of the dinner, they gave us some cinnamon donuts to-go with our meal, which was the real cherry on top of everything. Loved this place, will definitely be bringing friends here for BBQ nights, and I could go on for days about the great service from Anthony.

Came to famous dave's for some BBQ, which tasted alright, but the wait was incredibly long, especially for something not that special . There are a few other BBQ places around the area, so if I had the chance or time, I'd probably give another place a shot and save yourself some time.

Never Again. I came to Oyster Bar around 1:00AM, with the reasoning: How bad could it be? Coming back from Hakkasan, we were a little tipsy and a lot a bit hungry, so we reasoned that it'd be a great time to try to beat the line and get some Oyster Bar.  Boy, were we wrong. The line was innocuous enough, only about 6 people ahead of us. Little did we know that at 1:00AM, the bar is basically full of wasted/trashed/smashed patrons who would take hours to finish their food.  With only about a dozen seats available at the bar, it took absoltiutely forever for seats to clear up and parties to be seated, especially if it was a party of 4 or more.   On top of that, it seemed like the bar was never made to accommodate so many people, and although all the pots were constantly cooking up gumbo or some other delicious dinner, the food itself took about 10-15 minutes to get served after ordering.  When we finally got seated, the clock read 3:15AM, and only two out of my three companions stayed awake long enough to enjoy the food.  We got one of everything on the menu, and everything was delicious. I wish I could write more about the quality of the food, but I honestly can't remember much after that wait. Just the taste of food and water finally reaching my mouth, as if I had been lost in the deserts of Nevada for days.  The food was good, but i honestly can't imagine anything worth such a painful and tiring wait.    And for the record, 1AM-5AM are not slow hours for them. I think the secret might be coming in around 6AM-8AM when party goers have finally headed to bed, and no one is willing to get up for breakfast.

Paradise, which is in reality Panera in every respect now, is the truly underrated and unknown best place to study. Almost every seat/table has its own set of outlets, there's wifi that's stable and reliable( although it does have a 90 minute limit during "peak hours", but I've honestly never had it enforced on me.  The food is pretty decent, there's baked goods, coffee, tea, and basically any other study snack you could want. And the parking is plentiful and there are a bunch of food stops including Which Which, Starbucks, and even a mall across the street.  Basically, this is the perfect place to study if you have no other place to study.

A pretty decent starbucks to come in and get some work done if you're in the area. There are a few others nearby that don't honor gold cards and card rewards, so be sure to stop by this one if you're planning to pay with your starbuck cards and earn rewards! It's been pretty full every time I stopped by, the staff has always been accommodating and friendly despite how busy they are.  There are also plenty of outlets around the place and the bathrooms are pretty nice. Stop by for some coffee and get some work done!

Awesome little burger and hot dog joint with a huge selection of different sodas as a nice little touch. All their burgers are huge and more than enough for one person, although we chose to splurge and grab onion rings with our meal. I've always been pretty fond of novelty and specialty sodas myself and it was awesome seeing a bunch of them at this little hole-in-the-wall burger joint.  Great place for some greasy, delicious fast food if you're craving some classic American burgers

For some reason every time I come to Arizona I NEED together froyo...must be the heat!   Yogurtology is conveniently located in a plaza near Safeway and the decor is pretty similar to all other froyo places. What set it apart for me was the section in the back with cookies, brownies, and other goodies that they suggest you put on the bottom of your yogurt cup. I had a brownie under my oatmeal cookie froyo and it was delicious! Yogurtogy also has a wide variety of toppings and even has baklava which I've never seen as a topping before. I got one just so I could eat it separately and it was great!  Five stars for the great flavors and for adding a little twist to the froyo fad!

Got to try this food truck at Food Truck Friday in Downtown Phoenix, AZ.  I don't know if I'm spoiled by Los Angeles Food Trucks and street food, but I was really unimpressed by all the trucks there, but Hey Joe! was a definite least favorite :(.   I ordered the Chicken Adobo after reading good things in other reviews, but the dish that I got kind of tasted like something I would whip up quickly at home. The chicken was quite dry, and the whole dish was just kind of bland. The rice was cooked well, but it wasn't really that complicated of a dish but took a while to get to me and just wasn't that enjoyable.  Maybe it was a bad day for the truck or they were just busy, but I wasn't impressed :(.

I really want to give this place a better rating because it's so close to school and I honestly didn't find anything wrong with the experience but it really just came down to the fact that the sushi wasn't as good as other places for a comparable price, even around this area, and the price wasn't a bargain in any way.  Ultimately, there really was just nothing that set this place apart from other sushi places around the area. I'd come here in a quick pinch if I was really craving sushi, but Tokyo Lobby nearby honestly had slightly better quality fish, the happy hour menu will bring some items to way cheaper than at Sushi Catcher, and they have more non-sushi items if you are into more of teriyaki, soba, or other Japanese cuisine.

We got boba drinks and the lady at the front was super friendly. The boba was alright, not the best that I've had (high standards after growing up in So Cal), but pretty great considering its in Arizona. They're also currently having a special where you get 10% off if you're a student!

came by this small mom and pop Hawaiian restaurant to check it out with some friends and could not be more impressed.  The food, service, and restaurant itself were all exemplary and really what all mom and pop shops should strive to be like, in my opinion.  We all were able to get "combos" of 2-3 of the items on the menu, which wasn't on the menu, but the owner working at the time was more than happy to accommodate for us.  She really went out of her way to give us anything we needed, and was super pleasant throughout the whole meal. The price of the food was pretty fair, and honestly I felt like I was at a friend's house just having dinner with the way she made the food and treated us.  The food itself was excellent. From the musubi to the chicken katsu to the  mahi mahi, I've never had Hawaiian cuisine this good, and was honestly surprised to find it in the middle of Arizona.   Will definitely stop by again, and if yo are around the area, I definitely recommend giving this place a try.

Get here early and grab the brisket! Came here with my friends on my last visit out to Arizona and this place is definitely a local favorite and rightfully so! On top of all their amazing meats at extremely reasonable prices, the people working here were incredibly friendly and helpful.   It's almost unbelievable to see them maintain this level of customer service and friendliness when they have 2 hour lines out the door before they have even opened, but this is an amazing example of how one should run their business, and they deserve all the praise that they get.  Expect ice cold water bottles while you wait in the heat in line, and if you're lucky you might get some ends or bits when they're cutting your meat! Love this place!

Came here the other weekend to grab some of these highly rated tacos after friends wouldn't stop raving about them. As someone used to side of the road,  cooked on a hot piece of foil, tacos, these were a pretty big departure from the norm for me, and although different I thought they were just as good.   To be honest, I'd probably prefer my street tacos to these tacos at Most Wanted, but they definitely are different than what most other taco places offer, and I think everyone should make an effort to come by and try it out at least once, they're definitely not bad for the price and taste like nothing else I've ever tried. They hae a huge selection of meats both spicy and non-spicy, from pork to beef to chicken, and they are more than wiling to let you sample all the meats, so don't be shy. Come through and give this place a shot, try all the different meats, pick your favorite few and chow down!
