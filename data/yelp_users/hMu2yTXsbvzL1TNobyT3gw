In searching for a new eye center in central phoenix, I decided on Central Phoenix based on the yelp reviews and I was so happy I did.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, they have the most up to date equipment and since they don't work on commission, you don't get expensive eye glasses pushed on you.  I wear progressive lenses, and the best part is that I love, love , love my new lenses. By far the most accurate prescription I have had, and I have worn progressives for several years.

this place is a dump.  All of the tiles are cracked and broken along the baseboards. There isn't Kleenex or paper towels in the bathroom, and of course no towel service.  The cardio equipment is old and most of the machines stick since the belts need replacing.  But I did sign up through Costco and it was cheap, so I guess you get what you pay for.

Extremely overpriced, for so so pizza.  I took my family there for lunch.  3 pizzas and an Ice tea, with tip $79.  The pizza is maybe a medium size and nothing to write home about.  There are much better pizza places for a whole lot less money.  I would not go back and would not recommend.

Friendly, professional and knowledgeable staff.  I was able to get in the same day that I injured my back.  Hours are great, and Julianna is great !  Highly recommend

Loved this place,  I had the seared yellowfin salad, and it was amazing.  It's pricey but worth it .  I would say to order it raw since I got it medium and it was cooked all of the say through, with no pink.  It was still amazing, even over cooked.

I took my dad's old, wind up watch in for a quote to fix.  It was over xmas/new years and Jay said it would be about a week and he would get back to me with a quote.  Well, a week came and went, ( MORE LIKE 2 WEEKS) and I called to check on my watch.  Jay told me he sent it out, he would have to check and call me right back.  He did not.  Another week went by, I called Jay again, he said he would check again and call me back.  I obviously was getting concerned that I was never going to get my watch back and made that clear.  He called me back and said he would have my watch by the end of the week.  He called me at the end of the week to tell me my watch was fixed and it would be $135.  I asked him what happened to the quote?  That I didn't authorize him to fix my watch and he apologized but said I had to pay.  Since my dad passed away, the watch had sentimental value so of course I paid.  He did discount the price to $100 but I think the guy is a shyster and would not recommend him.

Jen was referred to me  by a friend of mine.  After a really bad haircut a couple of months ago, I was excited to see what Jen could do to fix it.  She colored, highlighted and cut my hair in record time.  I have thick curly hair and wear it straight, which many stylists have a hard time with.  Jen  listened to what I wanted , and is amazing at her craft.  I highly recommend her .

Total scam , it doesn't work !! I spent $900 on treatments and didn't feel even 1 percent better . I'm allergic to every tree, grass and plant that grows in AZ and have Horrible allergies 12 months a year. I was an am desperate to find a relief . Save your  Money , this does not work . And  because I am a skeptic , I made them retest me after the treatment for trees and can you believe it didn't stick ??? They said that It was highly unusual but outside allergens are difficult . Whatever . Take your $900 And buy a life's supply of Allegra .
