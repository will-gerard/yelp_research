I never give 5 stars but doctor Ish Patel is nothing short of spectacular.  In 4 months he undid 6 years of issues. I can't believe it!!! I hope to stay with him till things stay this way :)  The service was very professional. It does take some wait time on certain days but I think that would be any doctor. Dr. Patel seems very knowledgeable.  U Wish I Did Not Have To move.

Seriously.... I like coming here for my regular checkups... Haven't had an issue so far but will update as time goes long. So far I have been vising since Feb for regular monthly checkups. (I just like to make sure I am in good health)  I was having issues with depression, ADHD, took him 3 months to iron it out. Now I am doing Great. Thanks Doc

The flowers were expecting sobe but that's not their fault it's my gf's lol. They provide excellent customer service. I forgot my wallet but they were nice enough to call and let me know before I was all the way home. They have a great attitude. I guess win win for both my gf and them

Absolutely the worst food ever. I would compare it to a quality of dogfood. I wish I could get my money back but I am too timid to create a scene in public. Will never go here again. This is not mexican food by any means.....

Decently priced and quality. I tried  the chicken burrito with chips and salsa. Everything was super fresh. Even the chips were fried fresh. Very happy with my meal

Although the customer service was super pleasant, the sub sandwiches were not.  They are great for a drunk person that just has the munchies but not the place if you are looking for quality.

Update : quality is still great but a bit pricy for the college pocket. Service was awesome and I love their fried calamari with the fried jalapeños .... yum yum

Got the mixed grill, lamb curry, and naan. Everything was very well made. The naan was crispy but soft (exactly the 2qy it's supposed to be), the rice was definitely basmati, the mixed grill came sizzling. It was a spectacular meal!

Got the chicken burrito and girlie got a torta. Torta was good burrito was so small that I had to order a taco. When they say America's taco shop they mean that it's a redneck taco shop.  Quantity sucks, it's not authentic at all, and comes with a huge price lol....   Never coming here again.   The service was nice

So I just has one of the best customer service experiences with Max. Situation: was told that the funds were in my acct (the pro power up). I had lost the card so another store told me I was at at loss.   Matt s Resolution: He called up game stop and confirmed my trade-ins and purchase while other employee was friendly also. I cant believe he recovered my trade ins and I was able to get Destiny today!   THANK YOU! MAX

It's a hit or a miss. I have been when they served great food and unfortunately I have also been here while receiving terrible service and food from the meat head at the counter. My gf was appalled that the Caesar salad had lettuce, old cheese and drenched in Caesar dressing. I feed animals in a more humane manner lol. Never going here again!

Fresh chips even at 4pm.... lunch menu also at 4 pm. Service is satisfactory for the lunch menu orice. For ex: ordered soda and water only soda came. but that's ok. It was only 7. 02 for 3 tacos fresh chips nd salsa also beans nd rice. Can't beat it

Not sure why people rated it so low but we thought the food was great and fresh. The menu prices are so easy on the wallet. I think they should be getting more business. It takes them a bit to cook but all fresh food takes time to prepare. :) I am happy cause it was a great meal

Good was great and so are the prices. Not sure why people are rating it so low. It's a mom and pop place that cooks fresh food. All in all I hope this places doesn't  close down. It's a new favorite

Great service, Attitude and professional. Got Vent cleaning done from these guys, it was quite extensive but the type of cleaning and the level of service provided was well worth it. The owner explained everything in detail and how his procedure is different from the industry standard. Moving into my new home I wanted to be sure the job was handled in the right way rather than it being a superficial cleaning. Well these guys are the best!

The Service is nothing short of spectacular. The host not only wants to feed you out of the goodness of his heart, they actually care a lot about how much people like their food. My gf has issues with hot food but the host was so nice, offered her remake her food but didn't have to because it came out perfect just like she had ordered. The food is so amazing, this will be my regular go to Indian place. I grew up in Chandigarh so I am from Punjab but this place makes better Punjabi food then most places out there. Only one thing they are vegetarian. Another thing I love about these guys. Polite, excellent food, very hospitable, just simply amazing.  Foods to try: Gobi Manchurian, Any DOSA, vegetable biryani, so and the desserts OMG it making me hungry just thinking about it.
