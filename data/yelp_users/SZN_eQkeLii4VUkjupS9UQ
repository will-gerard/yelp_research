I've been going here for years.  I've tried other places intermittently, and none compare.  I always end up coming back to Queen Creek.

Most of their food I've tried has always been VERY good, except the fries (I would imagine that would apply to anything else that they deep fry, but I cannot attest to that).  The grease in the truck is so dirty that the fries come out so dark they look like sweet potato fries.  The dirty grease is absorbing into the fries and making them soft and rubbery instead of juicy and crisp.  This alone would've only gotten them 3 stars instead of 2, if only they hadn't lied and said their fries were so dark because of the type of potatoes they use.  Just clean the grease already...  Yuck!

People are friendly, food is good, atmosphere is relaxed. If they were to pay attention to tiny details, this would've been a 5* review. Either way, it's a favorite for my husband and I. We'll definitely be back.
