Where else can you get 59 cent tacos at? You get beans, cheese and lettuce on them. The inferno hot sauce is the best here. They told me everything they use is organic so that's definitely a plus. You can get full with just 3 bucks or less. The bean tostadas are pretty good here too. It's like taco bell but cheaper, healthier and just flat out better in every way possible.

At first I was upset because they didn't have vegetable burritos on the menu but the waiter decided to make one for me anyway and put everything I asked for in it. He kept it at the same price as the other burritos too! Which was like 10 or 11 bucks. I really appreciated that he did that. The vegetable burrito is huge and really good! They put enchilada vegetables, sour cream, guacamole, onions, jalapenos, beans and cheese with rice on the side. IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! Arriba Mexican Grill is the new mexican spot for me! Ask for Jonathan. He is a great server! He is the reason for the 5 stars! You guys need to give that guy a promotion or something. Great service!

My favorite restaurant. Upset they got rid of the eggplant sandwhich but it's not a big deal they still have plenty of other stuff for me to eat. The waiting time to sit isnt long and worth the wait! Great food with tons of choices and amazing service! I have never been to a cheesecake factory that i didnt like. Oh yeah they have a nice bar for those who drink.

They have my jalapeno bean and cheese chimichanges here. These are hard to find these days! They also have alot of authentic mexican products. Everything here is usually at a affordable price. Good grocery store with prices that won't hurt your wallet. The name is fitting since it's pretty huge for a grocery store.

Books, magazines, comic books, action figures and board games at a great price! A lot of the things they sell is used but still good. I can see myself buying many books from here in the near future. All paperbacks are half the publisher's price. This place reminds me of Strand in New York. I like it and will be coming back. I think I might start reading again thanks to this store. They also sell old school video games (mostly pc and handheld stuff), music and DVD's. Magazines are only a dollar if they are over a month old. Books average from $2 to $8 dollars.

Food from all over the world! Seriously! Thailand, India, Dominican Republic, Japan, Brazil, Mexico and the list goes on and on. Beer from all over too! This was my first trip here and it's already officially become my favorite grocery store! I will be coming here all the time. The store smells funny but I blame that on the seafood and all the spices they have. I love this place. If you're looking for something from anywhere, it's probably sold here! And at a good affordable price too!

The manager here by the name of David needs to get fired ASAP. Worst customer service ever. He actually refused to give me and my girl ice waters in 110 degrees and we were with a kid. Never before have I been denied ice waters in Arizona before. This McDonalds has officially lost me as a customer. What he did has to be illegal. He actually told us "I am denying you services right now". If you ask me I think he was racist. He claimed to be native american but I highly doubt that he is. We went at 9:40pm on June 26, 2016.

Great store. They have everything you would expect from a hardware store and more. They even have selfie sticks! The bathrooms are always clean and the manager does a good job of not letting the store look like a warehouse even though that is what it is essentially. Lol. Customer service is excellent, especially by the freight team and plumbing/kitchen and bath. This is my favorite Home Depot.

Love going to this spot after work. I always get 2 cheese quesadillas and hash browns and end up paying only 8 dollars in total. Sometimes i also order something called apple crisp for dessert. It's delicious! It comes with apples, pie crust, caramel and ice cream. Food is made quick and well.

Awesome buffet for only 10 bucks during lunchtime. Lots of vegetarian choices, salads, soups, pizza (at least it looks like pizza) and desserts including ice cream. It's all included with the buffet. The mac and cheese looked amazing! I haven't ate here yet. I just took my girl here and seen everything they had to offer and everything looks fresh and clean so I'll change this review if my girlfriend doesn't like the food or if I dont like it once I try it myself.

Not the cleanest cheesecake factory I've visited. The forks and spoons were very dirty and placed directly on the table. The waitress was a bit mean sounding, not sure what her name was but she had short hair and sounded like she was from London/England. She gave my girlfriend a ton of attitude while she was making her order. I understand that my girl was being a little indecisive and it may have been annoying but you are suppose to have patience when you are a server. I asked for extra bread and was given the hardest bread ever. The first batch of bread was fresh. I ordered 2 sides of mac and cheese and a side of sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were cold and seemed like they werent even fully cooked. The mac and cheese was delicious but I found a hair in it so that kind of ruined it for me. This is the worst and dirtiest cheesecake factory I've ever been to. They need to hire a new manager and new servers. If they don't change things up soon I see this place getting shut down in the near future. Don't eat here unless you want to get sick. This place should change it's name to the Germs Factory.  To top all of that off. The server decided to leave her shift before we were even done eating. How much ruder can you be? Servers always wait until their customers finish. Horrible service.

Horrible restaurant. They actually charge for barbaque sauce. I was told by Randy if I wanted just 1 barbaque sauce for my hashbrown sticks I would have to pay 39 cents. I asked to speak to the manager and Randy said he was the manager. He told me the barbaque sauce is only free when you order chicken tenders. I'm a vegetarian so i asked him is there anything I could order that is not meat related that can get me it for free and he said no. I hate this greedy restaurant. You're already overcharging me for 4 little hashbrown sticks and you expect me to pay extra for just 1 barbaque sauce? Insane. Randy you and this restaurant have lost me as a customer until you stop being so greedy.

Everytime I go to this Walmart after work they seem to always be waxing the floors in the same exact sections of the store. This is a huge inconvience for me since it's the one part of the store I always go to (Grocery). Whenever they are waxing the floors they close off a bunch of ailses which leads to me wasting a trip to the store cause the product I was looking for is usually in one of those ailses. I also hate how the men's bathroom seems to always be closed for maintenance. Something is very fishy about this walmart. Do you really need to wax the floor every day?

I'm not a fan of fast food chains but the Big Breakfast here at Burger King or whatever the meal that comes with scrambled eggs, hashbrowns and pancakes is called is amazing! Better than Denny's even and cheaper. I can eat breakfast here everyday for the rest of my life. I'm a vegetarian so I ask them to replace the saugage with an extra hashbrowns. Mcdonalds always refuses to replace the saugage for something else so Burger King beats them automaticay. I will never go to Mickey D's for breakfast if there is a Burger King around.

Fast and courtious service. All kinds of bagels and all types of toppings. I love the walnut cream cheese they have. I've only ever found this type of cream cheese in one place ever and that was in some small deli in Brooklyn New York a couple of years ago but I've been craving it ever since and this place actually has it! It's now my official bagel spot. I moved to AZ a year ago and I am so glad I found this cafe. The bagels are made fresh and I have yet to find anything negative to say about this place. They have tables outside if you dont like eating breakfast in doors. Good atmosphere.

The pizza here is great! I'm from New York City and I approve this restaurant. Great tasting! One of the best pizza spots in Arizona for sure. Its hard to find good tasting pizza in this state but this restaurant has the recipe right. I got a medium pie and enjoyed it. I recommend this place. You can get 2 slices and a drink for $4.50 during lunch hours. They have a television on each side of the restaurant and there's a nice little seating area right outside with a cover over it to block the sun while you enjoy great food and fresh air.

Gas is way too expensive here. They rip people off just cause it's the only gas station around. It's Fountain Hills so it's expected I guess. Only thing I go here for is donuts and beer. I always get gas elsewhere unless I'm on empty and forced to go here. I hope one day the owner decides to lower the gas prices to a more reasonable price. Gas isn't the only thing overpriced here either. I tend to avoid this place at all costs unless it's late at night when this is the only spot open and I have no choice but to go here.

It's the only store within like 14 blocks so that makes them a must go from time to time especially if you live around here. They sell pretty much everything and have a good selection of beers and liquor. Alcohol prices have gotten better! 5 stars for that.

If you go to this Jiffy Lube then you have to ask for David. He was extremely helpful and gave us a great deal. We will only be going to him from now on whenever we need anything done on our car. We came here for an oil change and ended up leaving with not only a great price on that ($80 for synthetic) but we also got a new car battery with a 2 year warranty for $70. We have a Volkswagon Jetta S. Great place with great service by David who should be the employee of the month in my book. Happy customer.

Great service and food. The best looking Denny's restaurant I've been to. Today I had the banana and pecan pancakes with hashbrowns and scrambled eggs and it was delicious! We've been coming here ever since we moved to fountain hills like a year and a half ago. They actually have sugar free syrup and they sell beers now!

This store ripped me off. I was charged $100 for headphones that i was told was free. I bought a samsung galaxy note III at this location 2 years ago. I was under the impression I had just paid for only the phone and my phone case and the total came out to around $500. I thought I had paid the full price of the phone when I called sprint customer care today and was trying to change my plan to the $60 plan. I was told I couldnt change my plan because I bought my phone at a discounted price. So I called this store to find out how much I paid when I bought the phone here. Apparently the phone was 200 and something and the phone case was $80 and then there was a charge of $100 for a beats by dre headphone that i was told was free. The person that told me all of this was a lady who said she was the assistant manager, I didnt ask for her name but I should have cause she told me that there was nothing that she can do about one of her workers lying to me.  Avoid this store unless you want to be ripped off.

Not bad at all. They give a good sized plate or at least make it look like it's a nice portion by how they place it on the plate. I ordered the 3 cheese enchiladas with rice and beans combo plate and barely got any rice. I didn't like the beans too much, they had a weird texture to them but didn't taste bad. I hope they didn't have lard in them cause I'm a vegetarian. I was charged extra on each enchilada for having green sauce on them instead of red. Why do I have to pay extra for green sauce? I can't get red cause I believe there's some sort of beef in it and it's against my diet. Funny thing is I got charged extra for green and felt like it didnt even have any sauce in it. It tasted kind of dry and didn't have a spicy taste at all. I was hoping for hot since it is mexican. I would have given 5 stars if they hadn't charged me for green sauce, especially when I feel like I didn't even get any and if I did it was barely noticable. I'll come again one day and give it another chance but honestly I'll probably go somewhere else where they dont charge for sauce and actually give you as much sauce as you want instead of barely any and charge you for it.  The waitress was nice and the enchiladas were good and very cheesy. I just was disapointed by the little tiny bit of rice I got, the weird textured beans and the sauce situation. If it wasn't for the waitress I probably would have given this spot like 2 stars. She did a good job and raised my rating a little higher than it should be. Service was good. Pricing and the food could have been better.

Great boat ride! Loved every second of it. We paid a little extra to get on the boat early and got a drink each for free. We had the rum and coke and later paid more for a refill. There was a whole lot of nature to see, mostly mountains and eagles. The host had a great sense of humor as he told us about everything we were passing by. The tickets were $22 for regular admission and $27 to get on early and get a free drink or snack. We sat on top, under the shade and had an amazing experience. The 90 minutes went really quick. I guess time does fly when you're having fun. We took a bunch of pictures! Mostly selfies! I recommend this ride to everyone. We were the youngest people on the boat, aside from two kids. Everyone else was 60 years old and over. Next time we'll go on the weekend when they have live bands performing. There will be a next time. We went for our anniversary and are thinking about coming back every year.

They need to give Alejandra a raise. She's the best drive thru worker I've ever come across. She remembered exactly what we liked and wanted on our second visit. She has great memory and amazing people skills.   I ordered a vegetable burrito and loved it. This is now my go to mexican spot. It tastes like senor taco only with a cheaper price tag. I only paid $5.75 and it was huge! I'm so full now and somehow I still want more of it because it tasted so good. The horchata was good but they put too much ice in it. Next time I come here I'll try to remember to tell them no ice. The green chilaquiles here are amazing.

Horrible. THIS IS NOT NEW YORK PIZZA. I AM FROM NEW YORK CITY AND THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE!   No pizza I've ever ate has been this bad.   Stay away from this place. My boss recomended this spot to me and I'm upset with him for doing so cause I feel like I was ripped off. I paid 3 dollars for a slice that tasted like cardboard. It's close to a bunch of bars so I'm guessing any positive review left was written by a drunk person. In fact the day that I went, me and my girlfriend were the only two people who were sober in the restaurant. There was a lot of people there and they were all very very drunk. A group of drunk people who went in together ordered a few slices and ended up leaving all their food on the table after just a bite or 2. Worst pizza I've ever had. I'm from NYC and let me assure you this place is 100% false advertising with its name. The taste of the pizza here is extremely bland, the pizza is old, no tomato sauce at all and barely any cheese. This isn't even good compared to other pizza restaurants in Arizona and I think pizza in AZ is usually not too good compared to NYC pizza but this place is even bad compared to other AZ pizza places. Little ceasars and costco pizza is even better than this crap. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place. Just cause they play rap music from NYC and maybe one of the workers there is from NYC that doesnt mean they make good pizza. I'm from NYC and I can't make pizza either, I guess I could work here.

Best pizza you'll find in Arizona. I'm from New York City and this pizza spot gets two thumbs up from me. The style is as close as you're going to get to NY pizza in AZ. The sicilian slices are amazing and really filling, make sure you ask them to make it fresh, it's worth the 10 minute wait. They have a nice selection of sodas, including my favorites root beer and cream soda. My boss and a coworker of mine told me about this place and I'm glad they did. The owner was really nice, I believe her name was Lori and I think she's from Brooklyn. She was so happy to see another New Yorker that she gave me and my girlfriend a couple of free slices along with some sodas. That was really cool of her. Actually the truth is we came here the night before and had a horrible experience. We were served old, bland tasting slices of pizza with no flavor or tomato sauce and the next day I ended up calling and asked to speak to the owner or manager and the lady who picked up said that that was her. I told her about my experience and she said that she was sorry about what happened and that she fired the worker who made those slices. she said he was on his way out anyway and probably messed up the slices on purpose out of spite, which does seem like something someone might do in that situation I guess. She told me to come in and she would show me how her pizza really tastes like. I decided to give the place a second chance and I'm really glad that I did. Everything we ordered she gave to us on the house and it tasted so much better the second time around. The pizza was fresh and had a good flavor to it. She said she wasn't in the previous night and that I would have never had a bad experience had she been there the first night I went. I think I believe her. She was so nice! If you've ever had a bad experience at this restaurant, speak with Lori. She will show just how good their food actually is. I like how they have two good sized televisions with whatever the best sports game at the moment is playing and hip hop music from new york playing in the backround. A chill spot, where you can eat good pizza and enjoy some beer as well. Most pizza restaurants with "New York" in their name in Arizona are just using the name as a gimmick and don't really sell NY pizza. This one actually does sell authentic NY pizza. The slices could use a little more salt and olive oil, but it's still pretty darn good. That would just make it perfect if they did that. I recommend this place to everyone. Thanks Lori for the awesome hospitality and the great food you serve at your restaurant. I dig this restaurant and will definently be coming back.

I love the veggie burrito here. They make it huge and put sour cream, pico, guacamole, beans and rice. It tastes like an actual mexican burrito. Not fake like taco bell. The green hot sauce they have is really hot but so good. I cant get enough of it. I reccomend this place for sure. Great authentic mexican food.

Cool spot to chill and play pool at. They allow kids until 10pm. It's only $9 an hour for a table for four people. It's a calm and relaxing environment. We didn't try their food but I will make sure i do next time. We will be coming back soon. Lot's of tables and good music playing.

First indian buffet I've ever been to but I love it. I've gone there a few times now and it's already my favorite restaurant. I'm a vegetarian and they have plenty for me to choose from. The meat eaters have even more options so its great for any diet. They have this cheese in a spicy sauce that I always fill my plate up with, it has the perfect indian taste. You have to try the samosas, desserts, beers, naan breed, mango lassi, fruit custard, rice pudding and spinach. I go here with my girl everytime we're in town. The establishment is family owned and they are really friendly. They even remembered our name after only our first visit which really made us feel welcomed. They have really good prices! They give us a special everytime we go there even without the groupon discount. I can't get enough of this place.

I've been going to this buffet for almost 3 years now. It's the only indian buffet I've ever been to and I love it. I've been to indian restaurants before and have always felt like I could have ate more of whatever I ordered. Here, I don't have to worry about that. I always leave full and satisfied. There's plenty of vegetarian dishes which is greatly appreciated. The food is amazing! I can never get enough of the sag paneer and the dish with cheese in it with some sauce, not sure what it's called but it's my favorite thing here. The owners are really nice people and have great customer service skills. They always make sure me and my girlfriend are taken care of. As soon as we step inside they start making our mango lassi's and nan bread. We don't even have to ask for it. I love it. There's no other restaurant that I would recommend more than this one. Everything about this place is awesome and leaves you wanting to come back everyday. There was a week where we actually came 4 times. If you're craving indian, this is the spot to go to! The desserts are pretty darn good here too. I get rice pudding and mix it with fruit custard and a few pieces of milk candy. Did I mention this place is affortable? It's 8 bucks per person and if you go as a family of three they might give you a special price if you ask them about it and go there often. The restaurant is always clean. They have a television that is always on either one or two things, indian music videos or WWE wrestling. I prefer the wrestling but the music videos are cool to watch when eating this type of food. They sell tons of different authentic indian beers which is pretty cool. I can literally come here everyday. Love everything about it.

You get what you pay for basically but OMG is this place dirty! The floor in the entire buffet is sticky. It's like they've never mopped here before. Felt like I was walking on 5 years worth of spilled soda. The bathroom was even nastier, I'll leave out the specifics since I'm sure others have done that by now. 8 bucks for a lunch buffet from 11:30am to 3:00pm. My visit didn't start out good. The first thing I tasted was the incorrectly named mac and cheese which had no taste at all and tasted like just pasta and water with nothing else in it, which was improperly labeled as crab legs. Things got worse from there as I found out I didn't like their spring rolls and completely hated the sweet and sour sauce. I asked a waitress if she could make me pizza without pepperoni and she just simply shook her head no. I went to the hostess and asked her the same and she had it made for me in just 5 minutes. I guess the waitress didn't know english. I'm glad I asked for the pizza cause it was the best thing here. The onion rings were cold and there was no barbacue sauce to go with it. The fried plantains were good, really sweet and tasted almost like a Dominican made it, which is a good thing. The fried rice was alright. There wasn't much for me to eat as a vegeterian other than salad and the couple of items I mentioned. I'm not the salad type so I was left with under 4 things I liked in the entire restaurant. That's not what you want when you go to a buffet. I'll give them 2 stars for the pizza, fried rice and fried plaintans but honestly I'm being a little too generous right now. This place deserves to be shut down.

The worst mall in Arizona. I guess it's just a bit too conservative and not urban enough for me. Even stores I normally like aren't the same in the mall, they don't carry any of the things I normally get. I'm more into a hip hop style and this store is basically the opposite of that. Fiesta Mall and Arizona Mills are way better to me. There's never a single thing I find cool at fashion square mall. This just isn't my type of mall. It's honestly the first mall I have not liked at all ever.

Amazing hotel and casino when it comes to presentation. I haven't spent a night or gambled here yet but i went in and walked around and was completely astonished by how many stores there was inside. A lot of really cool shirts, food, merchandise can be bought at one of the many stores within the MGM Grand. I know of the Casino cause the MGM Grand Arena is where Floyd Mayweather usually has his boxing fights and he pretty much made me want to come here a long time ago and now I'm glad I did. My girl loved visiting so much that she wants to come back for new years and our anniversary. The elevators to the rooms have leather on the wall! LEATHER! I love this place. This is the only casino I have ever been to that doesn't stink like cigarettes. I don't think I even smelled any tobacco.

We went on a Thursday and got a special on the Fun Pass. The pass included 3 hours of unlimited rides: Bumper Cars, Go Karts, Laser Tag, Rollercoaster and bowling. We actually ended up bowling passed the 3 hours and they didn't say anything to us. The pass also came with a buffet. All we paid was $12 each and I have to say it was well worth it. They have a section called movie mania that has 3 different kid movies playing at all times. When we went they were airing How to Train a Dragon 2, Frozen and Finding Nemo. There's tables spread out through the mini theater so you can eat while you watch. Next door to the movie section was the Sports zone. You can eat in there too! They were showing the NBA Draft, UFC fights, Nascar racing and baseball all at the same time. We ate before we got on the rides and after. We were so full at the end of the night! The pizza wasn't the best but it did the job. The Mac and cheese was disappointing cause it was cold and not very cheesy at all. I had to put a ton of cheese on top of it from the salad bar. I did enjoy the baked potatoes and desserts. Overall we had a great time and will definently be coming back. This was our 2nd time here. The 2nd time was even better than the first! Next time we come I'm going to get the unlimited arcade games for 3 hours pass for only $15.

I went at 12:49am on the night of Friday the 13th, 2016. We went to the drive thru and no one said anything for a whole minute so we just went up to the window. A guy named Frank opened the window and refused to service us even though all we wanted was ice waters. We're in Arizona and it's 100 degrees outside isn't it illegal to refuse water? Frank needs to get fired. If we had to buy something to get them we would have but he told us to drive around the drive thru all over again just because he never said anything at the intercom. How is that our fault? There was only 1 car  next to us in a double drive thru when we went. After we waited forever behind a car he told us to go around and wait in a now long line for just ice waters. I don't know what that guy's problem was, but customer service is definently not what Frank should be doing. In case there is more than one Frank at this location. This guy had some tats on his arm. I will never go back to this location, not as long as Frank works here.

Big store. They even have a furniture store and sell fireworks. I just dont like it how the workers follow yiu around like you're going to steal something or do something crazy. I took a picture of something and a second later a voice yelled "what you doing?" really loud. I turned around and it ended up being a worker which i believe was a supervisor who was looking at me really angry. I dont think they liked non-caucasians coming here i didnt feel welcomed at all. Last time I come here. If they didnt sell fireworks i would have given them 1 star.

Everything is pretty much cheaper here than everywhere else. Costco is like Sam's Club and BJ's for those who don't know. I always come here for my Premier protein bars. They are the best I could find for a afforable price. They have 30 grams of protein and very little sugar in them. You can get 24 bars for only 21 bucks. You can't beat that anywhere else if you are trying to stay healthy and within a budget. I think I will always be a costco member. I love shopping at costco. I have never had a problem with any of their locations.   So many things you can buy here.  Food Clothes Snacks Electronics Glasses Jewelry  Household items Cleaning products Health products Ect.   Pros ----- Big screen TV's at a great price  ----- Affordable Good quality clothes   ----- Kirkland brand. You can only find these products at costco and they make pretty much everything from food to alcohol to clothes and it's usualy good quality.  ----- great price on liquor/wine/acoholic beverages   ----- best pizza in Arizona is sold at their food court but they only take cash in that section so be ready with cash on hand.  ------ a whole lot of ice cream for less than 2 bucks at the food court. No one else can top this.  ----- Samples of all types of food for free. You can literally get full off of all the samples they give here on a visit to a costco.   ----- 32 really big rolls of toilet paper for $16.   ----- lots of healthy snacks   ----- 50 cent water bottles at the vending machine.     Cons ----- they dont accept credit cards at the food court. You have to have cash.   ----- no grocery bags only boxes. You basically have to have a car with you when you come here or you will regret it, especially if you buy a lot. Or you can pay for grocery bags and you have to buy them in bulk.   ----- limited selection of certain types of food.   Costco has saved me a ton of money throughout the years. It's my favorite place to shop at.

My girl got the shrimp tacos and enjoyed them alot. They have a wide selection of hot sauces that you can select from yourself. They have fish taco tuesdays! I had a veggie burrito from here a while back and I remember liking it. They have a cool looking tree inside the restautant. The place has a cool vibe to it. So far my experience has been good.

I find it very convenient that this location has a chase bank atm. It really saves me time. I love it. I also like the t shirts being sold here, always some cool local shirts. Candy is usually on sale and you can get vitamins for a pretty good price. It's a good pharmacy. Average prices and ran well. They have a drive thru pharmacy!!

Not a gambler. I just go there for the food. Some really good restaurants (including a buffet). Love the indian tacos at the silver platter. Cool casino to go to for New Years since they have a live band and free food. The free soda is cool too!

$2 to $3 for a movie is amazing! Free refills on popcorn and they allow pets as long as they are small and in a bag or purse! The movies arent new but they're new enough, just a month or two removed from the theaters. Love this place. Our go to theatre.

My first time having Animal Fries. They have melted cheese, thousand island dressing and grilled onions on top. #Amazing. I will be coming here all the time from now on. I am officially hooked. These fries are addicting! I can't wait to try something else on the menu. My first experience with In & Out is a great one. I recommend this place!

Great ice cream and they have games for kids to play while you enjoy it. A bunch of board games. I got the hot fudge sundae with cookies and milk flavored ice cream and brownies on top. I really enjoyed it. I'll be coming here again. It's organic too!!!

I have never seen a buffet with so many different options to choose from. I'm a vegetarian and still had plenty of stuff I could eat. The server did a great job filling up our cups. She did take a while to bring us some hot sauce but it was busy at the time. They have a ton of options when it comes to desserts as well! This place is amazing. I loved it. My only complaint is that some items were labeled incorrectly and others weren't labeled at all. As long as you get there before 11am you get the breakfast price, which is $8 per person. You can get there at 10:57am and stay until 3pm if you want and it will still be 8 bucks. If you go after 11am the price nearly doubles.   I had the following and enjoyed all of it.  Mac and Cheese Biscuits Pizza Hashbrowns Blueberry pancakes Scrambled eggs Corn cake French fries Tator tots Ice cream on a cone Chocolate pudding with whip cream on top

Biggest Macy's I have seen in Arizona yet. Closest thing to one in NYC. The first Macy's in AZ that I actually sort of like cause it has more than just conservative styles. More urban stuff is sold here and I dig that. I'll be coming here again soon.

Great spot for a late night dinner. They're open 24/7 on fridays and saturdays. They close early every other day so keep that in mind. I had the Veggie burger with toasted onions, guacamole and cheedar cheese on top with sweet potato fries on the side. It was delicious! My girl had a ceasar salad with grilled chicken and it was so huge and she loved it. We will be coming bacm for sure! Great food and service. Nice atmosphere.

Absolutely the worst restaurant I have been to in Arizona. They got my order wrong twice and then they got the price wrong. All of which happened on my first time going there. Never again will I go back. After getting the order wrong the first time the waiter had the nerve to argue with me and tell me that that was in fact what I had ordered. How would he know when i originally had a waitress who for some unknown reason was changed to a waiter. When I asked about the switch I wasn't given an answer, I got the feeling it was because the waitress didn't like the color of my skin. It seemed like this place doesnt like minorities at all. Horrible expierence that I never want to go through again.

We got water from the Glacier water machine in front of the store and it was tap water. I know what tap water tastes like cause I drank it everyday as a kid and that was for sure tap with no filter at all. Don't ever get water from the machine in front of this store's location. You will regret it. It's crazy how they are charging people for tap water. I wish I could sue or something. It has to be illegal!

If you're looking for authenic mexican/hispanic foods then this is the grocery store for you. The fresh produce section is stacked with some stuff you can't find in a lot of places. A product I was looking for wasn't in stock and a really kind supervisor helped me and my girl find it elsewhere but none of their stores had it. So she wrote my girl's name and number down and said she would get back to us as soon as they get another delivery of the product. It's christmas week and she said the product was selling like hotcakes. It's the frozen dough for empanadas. I really like how she treated us. Her name was Martha. She is the assistant store manager. She was really nice! Because of her I will definently be coming back to this grocery store. We will be coming back on Wednesday for our empanada dough. Thanks Martha!

Awesome bar with some really cool drinks! And best of all you're allowed to dtink it outside on the vegas strip. These drinks are freaking amazing. If you come to vegas you have to get one. It's definitely part of the whole vegas experience. It's in the mirage casino, right after starbucks, not too far from California Pizza Kitchen. My girl loves the drinks here. We got one for the fire/volcano show that starts at 8pm in front of the Mirage.

We came in at 11am and left at 2PM. We have a volkswagon Jetta and needed our breaks replaced plus new rotars. They worked on our car quicker than we expected and at a really good price. It came out to less than $300. We will be coming back here for sure. If you are looking to wait with your car I suggest you go across the street to the gas station when you want a snack. The vending machine and gum ball machines got stuck on us a couple of times.

Worst Walmart I've ever been to. There isn't much of anything at this location and the way they have the aisles set up makes no sense at all. The clothes was all plain and barely any choices in sizes. The video game section has like 10 games for each system and the food section barely has anything priced. I'm never coming here again. I left within just a few minutes.

Great looking hospital! The cafeteria here is awesome. I don't know if they let you eat here if you aren't visiting someone but I hope they do after the person I've been visiting is discharged. The food is great and the prices are amazing. I got the cheese quesadilla with jalapenos inside with guacamole and sour cream on the side with sweet potato fries for under 4 bucks. The quesadilla was huge and they gave me a bunch of sweet potato fries. This is the biggest and cleanest hospital I have seen in Arizona. Whoever runs this place is doing an incredible job! Oh yeah, they have a starbucks inside the hospital.

The drive thru lady gave us attitude but maybe she was just not having a good day so I won't hold it against the place. I had 2 BRC Burritos and they were really good. BRC stands for beans rice and cheese. They were big and fresh. The green hot sauce they give you is really good but you'lll have to ask for more since they only give you 1 unless you request more. I enjoyed the food and will be coming back.

False advertising. They do not offer wi-fi. I mean they do offer it but the service just doesn't work at all. The tech guy the front desk transfered me to said the server was down and there wasn't anything he could do. This was the case for my entire stay here. Avoid this place. This was a huge inconvience for me since it led to me missing my New York Giants game.

Probably the best thing about Fountain Hills. The Fountain is cool and pretty big. I like the scenary a whole lot and there's a dog park right next to it so if you have a dog you will like this park even more. I like how peaceful this place is. Sometimes I eat my lunch here with my girl. There's a trail right across the street from the park and jogging around the park is always a cool thing to do. My favorite park in Arizona.

This place is awesome! Just like Coldstone only it's healthier. They have cookie crisp cereal as a topping! Lots of yogurt flavors and toppings to choose from. I had the cinamon roll yogurt with reeses peanut butter cups, cookie crisp and nutella on top.

You get what you expect from a little ceasar's pizza spot and that's fast pizza for a cheap price. Hot and ready cheese pizza for 5 bucks is my go to when I go here. I don't like how they charge for parmesian cheese but it's not that big of a deal. It's not the best pizza in the world but it gets it job done and this Little Ceasar's is just as good as any other Little Ceasar's I've been to. Clean location with quick service.

I love the dollar menu here. The spicy potato tacos are awesome. I always get them. The cheesy bean and cheese burritos are good too. Fire hot sauce is good here. Not much else i can say. It's not the best mexican food but it's cheap and fast. It's great for what it is. I dig it.

Good food but horrible service. The waitress messed up my order and then had the nerve to say that it was my fault. I ordered a red curry tofu and she gave me a chicken red curry instead. I'm a vegetarian and would never order a dish that wasn't vegetarian. I also remember clearly saying tofu twice. Maybe this waitress just isnt cut out for the job. She should have apologized instead of saying that I didnt say tofu. I was outraged about this since it took forever to even get a waitress to my table. We waited like 8 minutes at a table and I had to go to a waitress in order to even get her to come to our table. They gave me uncooked brown rice but my girl's rice was fine oddly. I had originally ordered a thai iced tea but after my meal was redone properly, like 30 minutes after i ordered it, it was still not brought to my table. I approached the waitress about it and she acted like it was a new order. She needs to start taking notes cause her memory is horrible. I've come here before and had a good exerience but after tonight I dont think im coming back here unless they fire the waitress that served me. I believe the waitress's name was Lydia. I had to get up several times during my visit  just to get what i wanted and I find this completely unprofessional. I complained to a different worker after asking for the manager but that worker said the manager wasnt around but that maybe she could help me. I told her everything that happened and she apologized for the original waitress and offered one of us a complimentary scoop of ice cream served by the waitress that we had just complained about so it probably came with some saliva in it. I turned down the offer but my girl accepted it. The only thing that could have prevented this 1 star review would be either a discount off of our check for the original waitress messing up our valentines dinner or for her to simply apologize or get fired. The lady I complained to was nice but not nice enough to make up for what our horrible waitress had put us through. I don't think I'm ever coming here again.

Great vibe. The hookah is really good here. They have several couches and have tons of great food options on the menu. Try their fallafels and humus, you wont regret it. I had the hookah flavor called 'day to love' and it was pretty good with a melon and berry flavor to it. This is my second time coming here and I have enjoyed it both times.

Check out their special of the day. They have a good item on sale for a dollar each day. I come here on Wednesday for the bean burritos. For just 1 buck you can't go wrong. I add cheese for 50 cents. Their red hot sauce doesnt taste good so get the green instead. Cheese quesadillas are a dollar on thursdays. Great food for a awesome price.

Until last month I had nothing but good things to say about this place. I mean who wouldnt like a theater where they have a menu where you can order while you watch the movie, waiters, alcholic beverages and they bring the popcorn to you! But an incident happened that has me never wanting to go there again. I was there with my girl, girl's sister and my girl's son when all of a sudden a worker comes and accuses us of having a dog with us and said that we needed to put the dog in the car. We told the guy who claimed he was the manager that he could search us and the area we are sitting in, which he did and didnt find any dog but he still insisted that we had one because a worker of his had supposedly seen one. It seems like this area is racist because we were the only ones in the theater who were not caucasian and they just simply made something up to get us out of there. They refused to give us a refund and kicked us out for something that wasnt even true. Dont waste your time at this unprofessional and potentially racist establishment. Never have i had such a horrible experience at a theater before.

I stopped by to use the bathroom and ended up getting a sandwhich since I could smell the food from the extremely clean bathroom they had. The smell was completely irresistable. I had to get the footlong veggie pattie with guacamole and a bunch of other veggies on it!! I always love me some subway. Good, clean location!

I told the manager (Kobe or Colby?) I didn't like the way they made the sweet and sour tofu here at Pei Wei after I ordered it. He apologized and hooked it up with 8 vegetable spring rolls, which was twice the price of what I ordered but he gave it to me at the same price as my original order. Great service here. The vegetable spring rolls were really good! Next time I wont order the tofu here cause they don't bread it like other chinese restaurants do. If they give me the vegetable spring rolls at this price every time I come here I'll be a frequent customer but if they expect me to pay almost 20 bucks for 8 of them then this is most likely my last time eating here since this is basically the only thing I would/could eat here. The service by the guy who I mentioned who I believe was the manager is the reason for the 5 stars. He made my visit go from a horrible experience to a great one in just a matter of seconds. Give that man a raise!!!  Pros ----- Amazing soda/beverages machine. I Have never seen anything like it before. It's digital and touch screen and has so many different options to choose from. I chose the vanilla cherry dr pepper which wasnt too good but I cant complain since I asked for a water and got soda instead.  ----- Great customer service. If you don't like your meal they will be quick to change it to your liking and will even replace it for something more expensive at no additional cost (at least that was my experience)  ----- Really good vegetable spring rolls and a great chilli sauce to dip them in. You will get addicted to them but the price isnt right for them. I wish they were cheaper so i guess this is a pro and a con.   Cons ----- Doesn't look or feel like a real chinese restaurant. None of the workers or cooks are chinese. They are pretty much all caucasian.   ----- The tofu is horrible. They dont know how to make the tofu the way every other chinese restaurant makes it. They need to start breading it and frying it the right way.   ----- Overpriced meals/appetizers. Over 9 bucks for 4 spring rolls is insane.   ----- They dont fry their vegetables even if you ask them to.  This place honestly didnt deserve 5 stars, maybe more like 2 or 3 at most and even that is being generous but the customer service was so good that I am giving it a 5.

$1 burritos on wednesdays. It's the spot to go that day. The burritos are huge and for only one buck? You really cant go wrong. They have other cool deals throughout the week but that's my favorite. Good food at really great prices! If you're in the mood for mexican this spot is way better and more authenic than taco bell! Worth a try. Get the green hot sauce. Their red sauce is no good. They have a drive thru and are open late!

You have to try their diablo sauce! I always go there mostly for just that sometimes but their burritos, tostadas and enchiladas are pretty good and reasonably priced! The hotsauce alone is worth the trip. Great mexican spot.

I'm from New York City and I know pizza. This isn't the best pizza I have ever had but it's one of the best I've had in Arizona. But that isn't exactly saying much since I've had a whole lot of horrible pizza experiences in Arizona so far. Rosatti's, Grimaldi's and Pisa Pisa are way better and are easily the best in Arizona but this spot is walking distance from my house and it isn't horrible and for that reason I give it 4 stars. I've only had their cheese pizza and cheese bread so far, both were alright. It helps that this place is right next door to a liquor store too. I must admit the day I got pizza from here I was drunk so next time I try this spot I might have to change my review since everything tends to taste better when I'm drinking.

This is a great pizza place. Perfect brick oven taste at a good price. The pies run you for about 12 bucks. If you've ever been to Grimaldi's before this place has a similar taste. Best pizza restaurant I've been to in Arizona yet.

Great Native American food! I always get the Vegeterian Indian Taco when I come here and it never dissapoints. Great taste! Just make sure you add salt to it cause they don't seem to put much or any in it. Biggest fry bread house I've been to. This place is huge compared to all the others around. Great spot.

Great fun spot and it's only $10 per person if you go before 11am during the summer for an all day pass that lasts until 5pm. The pass includes bowling, pool, laser tag and gravity rope. That's a great deal. I feel like going all the time now after finding out about this special. Cool place for a kids birthday party.

I liked how they have a different type of seating area with seats on the floor made out of carpet with short tables next to them. I ordered the Falafel sandwich. It came with hummus, lettuce and tahini sauce. I requested for them not to put pickles and tomatoes on it. I didn't like how they don't serve ice water. We asked for three cups and got 3 water bottles instead. The waiter told us that was the only type of water they served. It yelled money hungry and already started things off on the wrong foot. We told the server we didn't want the water bottles. I later ordered a soda since the food definitely required some kind of drink with it to help wash it down. I was dissapointed when my food came out and the portion was extremely small compared to what they normally give me at other middle eastern restaurants. They only gave me 3 fallafel balls, barely put any hummus on the pita bread and the pita tasted bland and old. I didn't like their hot sauce and that would have been the only thing that could have saved my dish, had it been at least half decent tasting but it just tasted like vinger and I really don't like hot sauces that taste like that. If you're going to make the fallafel sandwich that small then at least give a side of rice with it like every other place I've been to does. We had the baklava for dessert, it wasn't as sweet as I'm used to it being but it wasn't bad, it just didn't have much flavor compared to the baklava I've had at other places. I did not enjoy my visit and will not be coming back.

Lots of sushi choices and it's inside the Fort Mcdowell casino. Free soda if you get a server walking around with them by the slot machines so that's a plus. Only bad thing about this spot is they don't sell sweet potato rolls and thats the only type of rolls I like but my girlfriend loves this place so hence the 5 stars. Note to the manager of the location please start selling sweet potato rolls!!! I will be your most frequent customer if you start selling them. I like how they make the rolls fresh right when you order them and I also dig how they have three tv's playing in front of you while you eat. The movie Taken 2 was playing when we were visiting. I like how they have the definition of every type of roll they have on a slip. I have never seen the rolls broken down that easily before.

Overpriced for no reason. 5 onion rings for 4 dollars? Seriously? That is the biggest rip off ever and the onion rings weren't even big and even if they were it wouldnt matter cause they're big pretty much everywhere and they give you way more for less money. Avoid this place at all costs. I will never come here again. The owner needs to stop ripping people off.

This was my favorite liquor store at one point. They sell liquor and cigars from the Dominican Republic and no one else does anywhere else in Arizona. You can find beer with any type of flavor imaginable. The prices here are usually bettter than anywhere else except maybe Bevmo. I was going to give this store 5 stars but after the racism I just experienced here I had to give it 1 star instead. We were followed around the store just because of the color of our skin. I guess they think all brown people steal or something. When we got to the register there was 5 people ahead of us, a couple of them were in our age group and none of them were asked for ID. When it was our turn the cashier (Liz) recieved a phone call which seemed to be about us because she said "yeah they are right here". She asked us for ID and my girlfriend was upset because were were the only ones that were asked. Everyone in front of us on the line was caucasian. I'm Dominican and my girl is Native American. We didn't feel like we were treated fairly at this location. She said we looked young and that was the reason for it supposedly but a couple of the individuals who she didn't card were younger than us, possibly in their 20's and we are in our 30's. They need to stop being racist or at least get rid of Liz and whoever made that phone call to her. We will go to a different Total Wine from now on or Bevmo until something changes at this one.

Donuts and smoothies 24/7. How can you not love this place? I tried three different donuts and loved them all. They were really freah and tasty. The donuts are a little over a dollar each and are well worth it. You can tell they make them with pride. This place even sells boba drinks! I haven't seen a location that sold that in Arizona until now. I used to drink those type of drinks in New York City. My girl tried the boba drink and enjoyed it. Overall I had a great experience and will be coming back.

The seats are super comfortable. They have leather recliners. You can just lay back and watch a movie, push a button and have someone serve you whatever you want to eat and drink, including alcohol. The theater room we got was smalk but the screen was a good size for the room. We went to see The Shallows and had a great time. We will be coming back. The theater is clean and has great customer service. We went on a tuesday and got the 6$ for any movie special. We went at 10:20pm and got there for happy hour. Happy hour is after 9pm until close. All drinks are half price during happy hour. I love this place.
