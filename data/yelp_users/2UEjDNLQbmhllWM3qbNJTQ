Decided to give new ownership a try. Food is pretty meh bar food. Pre-packaged and re-heated. They refused to put on an Ohio State game for my honey... tried to tell us it was over when it was in the second quarter, then 'forgot' then couldn't find the channel..... It's s freakin' sports bar!  Plus you have to walk thru cigarette smoke to get in. Not impressed.

Went in with boyfriend and 12 year old for dinner because it happened to be close. The waitress deigned to come by about 20 minutes later. Drinks came; my coffee had obviously been sitting on the burner since 6 am. Placed our (simple) orders. The place wasn't busy but after a half hour (soft drinks dry; no visit from the waitress) we asked where our food was. She said it would be right out. Ten minutes later we left. Told the lady at the door what happened and she shrugged. Couldn't have cared less.

Never thought I'd go to a new artist but Vinny is the bomb!  The shop is very clean and he has a light touch. He took my drawing and made it even better...now I have a great piece for my niece!!

I think I just had the worst waitress I've ever had. I guess it's a milestone. She took a while to get to our table, no big deal. Told us they were out of the beer my boyfriend ordered, then remembered maybe they weren't. Brought me a dish that wasn't what I ordered. After my bf finished his meal I was brought salmon so overcooked it was hard, 'lemon caper sauce' that tasted like flour mixed in water, and boxed mashed potatoes. The mixed veggies were OK. My boyfriend ordered a refill on his all-you-can eat fish fry and another beer. She forgot it all and came back a while later to ask if he wanted more (!?). I tasted the fish fry. Flavorless cod, just like they rolled it in plain flour, with pre-packaged French fries. I'll never understand why a restaurant can't cut and fry a potato. The fish refill came without the sauce for which he'd asked. The waitress did offer a free Guinness, but I had to pay full price for the salmon dinner I didn't eat and complained about.  At least I was entertained by the band butchering some cover tunes. Doesn't make me want to rush to the Green Isle anytime soon.

George got me in right away even though I live on the other side of town. He worked magic on my kid and pet-stained carpets and rug. He and his brother (who is now serving our country) really went above and beyond working on our carpets and also educated us on how to care for them. No upsell, no hidden fees, and he only charges for the carpet not covered by beds/dressers/etc; not the whole room. Great price.

I came in for the first time and was not impressed. Clothing was cheaply made and everything kind of had the dollar store/ made in China feel. I saw a sale t-short for $20 and a lip gloss for $11. Too expensive for the poor quality. I picked out 2 things and when I looked for someone to help me at the cash register, I was startled by an ex-con looking lady. She was obviously irritated when I rejected a pair of denim shorts when I realized the price was 35.99. Nothing in the store is worth that much. Then she snapped at me when I didn't provide an email address, telling me their text program wouldn't give me any discounts. She literally tossed my bag at me and walked away. Wow.

Very good Mexican food ( I get the spinach enchiladas) Some vegetarian options. Nice staff, too. Try the cadillac margarita! Not dog friendly despite a patio, though

Yummy fresh food, free WiFi, chill vibe, fun music. Dog-friendly patio.  What's not to love?

Not good at all. Started out with being brought the wrong beer, no big deal. Then the waitress forgot we'd ordered appetizers (blamed it on the beer mix-up) so we never got them. My boyfriend ordered fish and chips which were two previously frozen triangles of greasy fish with also previously frozen french fries and a tiny portion of vinegary cole slaw. I ordered pasta salad with vegetables ($13) and added shrimp for $7. I got three (3!) regular sized shrimp. The pasta was grocery store-type bow tie, with mushy squash and some other veggies that weren't bad, served cold. The taste was very bland, just a mildly lemon tasting oil. This from their 'Cordon Bleu' trained Chef de Cuisine,  as the menu advertises? The fish special was $32, glad I didn't waste $$ on that. The decor is a combo of red leather banquettes, southwest, Greek and other randomness. On a Friday night, the restaurant was sparsely populated with a mostly elderly crowd.  Save your money for a different Cave Creek restaurant.

I love this place!  So friendly, cool-looking office, skilled doctor. The price is right too; I'm paying 50 bucks a session for tat removal and it's going great. Practically pain-free. I never feel rushed, they take time to answer any and all questions. They offer other services like B-12 injections, botox, vitamin infusions, etc but never push anything or upsell. I'd recommend it to anyone. Plus free oranges to boost your vitamin C!

Really impressed. My honey had the small plate meatballs which he enjoyed. I had a crispy kale salad; if you like you can get any of their salads in a smaller portion for $5. I also had a blue crab cake which was mostly crab and not a lot of fillers... Yum! White peach sangria was good and $6.95. The staff was very friendly, and the place is small but cute with a garage door front and industrial style with pretty velvet chairs. They have a pretty and dog-friendly patio with live music on Thursdays. The coolest part was sitting at the bar watching the chef create everything right in front of us in the wood-fired oven. We'll be back for their great specials like lasagna dinner for two with a bottle of wine for $22(!)

Good, fresh food. Everything is well-cooked and they use fresh potatoes, not frozen. They have a lot of skillet breakfasts. I don't like their coffee; it is bitter no matter how much you doctor it. There is a wait on Sat & Sun and there are no chairs for those waiting. Patio is not dog-friendly. It's a bit loud, nothing to soften noise and no background music. The place is cute with the exception of their dusty metal flower decor. Wait staff is very nice.

First time here, and we'll be back! The staff is super nice. The sushi chef gave us a free amuse bouche to start. I had a  vegetarian pho filled with perfectly cooked veggies and rice noodles, which was served with a plate of add-ins like fresh basil, jalapeño, and bean sprouts. They have Sapporo on draft. Can't wait to try the sushi next time!

I was not thrilled about going to a meat-centric restaurant, but I accompanied my boyfriend and was pleasantly surprised. Our appetizer was the eggplant frites... I've had bitter eggplant before but this was very lightly breaded and dusted with parmesan.  Light and delicious! He had the French Dip which he said was the best he ever had and he's a food snob. I saw something on a yelp review about a veggie platter, and I ordered it.... it is called the chef's vegetable antipasto. I got a cutting board filled with a tiny frisè salad, roasted tomatoes, carrots, and fingerling potatoes, broccolini and a delicious salad of fresh tomato, watermelon & balsamic. Everything was  perfectly seasoned and so flavorful. Our waitress, Jacki, was amazing.  Knowledgeable, sweet, and even though she had a bunch of tables our wine and water glasses never ran empty. I gave 4 stars because I wish there were more veggie options, but I'll be back!

My boyfriend stopped in to get pizzas...Several employees ignored him although there were no other customers. He noticed dead flies on the pineapple and other toppings which were not covered. He finally walked out without ever being spoken to by staff who saw him standing there.

Good sound but otherwise not a fan. Long line to be searched/metal detected before you go in. We paid $11 for a small bottle of water and one very small, weak mixed drink. There is hardly any seating which gets old after a few hours on a concrete floor. The stage is so high up it's like sitting in the front row at a movie theater, it hurts your neck. OK if you're in the back, though. I'll only return if it's an awesome band.

Nikki really straightened out my mish-mash of colors from trying to find the right stylist. I now have a beautiful buttery blonde that is just what I wanted! She is sweet and makes you feel beautiful. She toned my first color for free when I felt it was a bit ashy. She wants her clients to be happy!
