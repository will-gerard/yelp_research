This place is aweful! I got my brakes done and just 4 months later they were toast. Called to have them fix and they refuse. They took my 400 and now won't honor fixing their crappy job. My advice- avoid this place at all costs.

I'm giving Organ stop 4 stars purely because of the organ. I would give the food and service 2 stars. It's cash only and that's just silly but beyond that they have a separate line to order pizza and then to order drinks!  The food is so so but really it's all about the experience and not the food. Kids live it and a word to the wise- don't go at prime dinner time. There will be a ton of old people and no seats.

This is a regular spot for my hubby and I to take the kids, hang out and enjoy some good wings. They are always so willing to let us taste and re taste the sauces and will even exchange wings if we really don't like the flavor we picked. We go enough now that we pick the same thing all the time but for newcomers don't be intimidated by so many choices. The fried pickles are SO good and they have some great happy hour specials as well.  The service has always been good for us and friendly.  There are a ton of good choices for beer on tap and bottled and overall it is a great spot. If you are looking for quiet though, pick someplace else. It is a very loud place and that makes it a great place to bring the kids;-)

We have been here twice now and love it. I gave it 5 stars for what it is- a local takeout Chinese food place. If you are going here expecting an eat in, fancy dining establishment then this is not the place.  The food is great- not overly greasy and full of flavor.  They have a large menu and a reasonably priced family dinner.  So far it is the best takeout Chinese food we have found in this part of the valley.

This is the only place I will go too when getting a mani or pedi. The owners are very nice and the staff is friendly. Very clean and they will even offer you bottled water for free. The pedis come with a hot stone massage that is fabulous. Give them a try and you won't regret it!

I visited for the first time a few days ago and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I have tried a ton of Chinese food places in the east valley over the last 2 years only to find most are no better than Panda Express and that isn't saying much.  We ordered the Fried rice, Almond Chicken and Broccoli Beef. The Fried rice was your basic rice with peas and chicken and was good. The broccoli beef was also good. The Almond chicken was delicious! I had the perfect mixture of flavor.  We will definitely go back! They were very friendly as well so that was also a plus.

I love this place. I have had at least 8 screws in my tires over the past 6 months and they have patched them all for me for free! I did have one instance where my tire was beyond repair and not only did they offer me a credit for the old tire, they match a competitors price for a new tire that was similar and I ended up with a new tire for only 20 dollars!  They are fast, understanding of my time, and reliable. I will never go anywhere else because of how great they have always been!

I love joes! They have some of the best hamburgers around and I'm not much if a fan of burgers. I know a ton of people rave about the pizza but I don't think that is their best item. If the weather is nice, sit outside and enjoy the atmosphere.  Side note about the flies- yes in the summer they can get bad. It has FARM in its name though, so I'd you don't like nature you might want to skip it.

I LOVE this place! If I could own a coffee shop it would be this one. Every time I go I wish I could buy the place! The food, drinks, bakery items, atmosphere- all just fabulous!!! If you go for breakfast you HAVE to try the Papas burrito. It is just SO good! I also think their scones are the best around. They are never dry and slightly sweeter than most scones.  I know they have had huge accolades for their cupcakes and while they are pretty and I think they are good I don't know that they are the best ever. I would pick a scone or the burrito any day over the cupcakes.  The best thing is to get a seat outside when the weather is nice and just relax, watch the  birds and drink a coffee with breakfast!

This place is close to my office and I have gone now a few times. The service is fast and the food is decent. They also offer a few unique items (like a buffalo burger) and the chicken dishes have been great! Price is good but don't expect anything fancy there. It is a very basic kinda a bar feel, kinda a restaurant feel. Overall I liked it and will go back!

This is one of my favorite "hole in the wall" places to eat. The prices are great and the sushi is always fresh. They also have some pretty decent appetizers.  The Lemon Roll is very refreshing and you really can't go wrong with their lobster roll either. The only roll I haven't liked is the southwest roll and only because it was so spicy I couldn't enjoy it.

To me this is just a blah sushi establishment. Service was awful but beyond that the sushi was no better than the rolls I can get at the grocery store. Most of the rolls were very heavy on the fake krab and left a lot to be desired. I would rather pay more and get better quality with more variety. I won't be back and will continue looking for "the" sushi place in the east valley.

Let me start out by saying that had I written this review 2 years ago it would have been at least 4 stars. At this point 2 is all I can bring myself to give.  Cork used to have a Sunday brunch that was amazing and priced very well. They also had bottomless mimosas. They stopped doing brunch and from there the dinner service seemed to loose its luster as well.  The food is sold as being tapas or tasters but the price does not reflect this. The service is so-so and actual food is hit or miss.  Add to all of that - the hours keep changing. They are sometimes closed for the summer or not open certain days.  We won't be back mostly because there are so many other places we can get an amazing dinner but for half the cost.

This place always has great service and the food is good. I do think the salads are a bit pricey for what you get but you can't go wrong with the pizza. The lunch specials for the pizza are a great deal although if you go at the end of lunch hour the pizza might have been sitting there for a bit. Overall a good place for lunch and the people are super friendly.

I am a big fan of Crackers and I have eaten here many times. I have visited all of these locations and the best one by far is the location on Greenfield. They have the best patio and indoor look and feel. All the locations do look the same but the feeling you get from the Greenfield location is just somehow different. I have had most of the desserts and you really can't go wrong, they are all really good.  The waffles and pancakes are always delicious and why they have another form of pancakes called "healthcakes" I am not sure how healthy they really are! When I asked the server she mentioned little things that might lower the calorie content but nothing major.  The chicken enchilada omelet is really good and has a nice spice to it.  My only complaint would be that depending on who your server is you might get an attitude if you ask for substitutions beyond the standard cottage cheese or fruit they will offer. (Like asking for sausage instead of toast and potatoes) If you go on a weekend for breakfast be prepared to wait a bit.

Well, we will never go back and let me tell you why.  I actually liked the decorations. I am not a hunter and personally I can't stand it and don't get it BUT I can appreciate that is a hobby for some.   I just couldn't get past how bad the service and food was! We spend almost $100 for 2 people and it wasn't worth $50.  I ordered the filet and it comes with veggies and a starch. Well I asked if I could have just all veggies and the server says "I will have to check with the chef to see if we can make an exception. We don't normally allow that". Uhhhh I'm sorry if my dietary restrictions are just too much for the chef! Really, how hard is it to just leave off the potato and add extra broccoli? We order and then wait, and wait, and wait... it took almost an hour to get our food. At one point the server came by and asked if they could butterfly my steak so it would cook faster. I said that was fine but when the food actually came out they didn't even butterfly my steak. My steak was burnt to a crisp. I mean WELL done. I ordered it medium. If you are going to have "Steakhouse" in your name then cooking a steak correctly would be a start.  Also, I asked our server if we got bread with our dinner. His response? "Oh, well it was still in the oven when  you ordered so I thought you wouldn't want any" Hmmm way to be proactive and ask.  I guess what gets me the most is I gave my feedback about how the steak was awful  (I didn't even finish my dinner) and the response was "Oh sorry about that". There was no offer for them to fix it, take it back or own up to it.  I will never visit this place again. I hear the Applebees down the road can cook the hell out of my steak too for a quarter of the price.

I visit this DD almost every morning for coffee. There is one employee there in the morning that is just a really nice and friendly human being. I honestly don't know his name but he takes the orders through the drive through and is always very friendly and happy. He also is considerate if I am on the phone and while I understand that is kinds of rude of me, he gets that people work and it happens!  The coffee is the best and worth the price. They also have a punch card where you can get your 8th cup of coffee free. Overall I LOVE this location!

This place is amazing!!! We don't even think about going to any other gelato shop. There are so many amazing flavors are they are not stingy with the samples.  The salted Carmel is a must!!!  Lastly- the staff here is nice. The only reason I mention it is that there are many ice cream or yogurt shops  and most of the time the staff is poorly trained or just not friendly. At Frost they always smile and treat you like a person!!

I love the food here! I have had salad, soup, pasta and the sandwiches and I am yet to be disappointed.  The pesto Cavatappi is very good. I am usually not a fan of pasta but it's that good.  The soups are all great and my favorite panini is the chicken pomodori.  If you have room then try a dessert. The coffee cake and whoopi pies are tasty.

I wanted to give them 5 stars but the staff was not a five star staff. All 4 stars go to the shaved ice! I had sugar free pineapple and tigers blood and both flavors were so good! My husband and daughter got the traditional pog and said it was great. I recommend this place just because the shaved ice is that good! I mentioned the staff and the problem was that they are teens with no idea about customer service. A smile and a little help with the menu would go a long way!

I wish I could give this place a better review. The food is good so that's the 2 stars. Management and service are awful. I've been here several times- I sat at the bar twice, both times not busy yet couldn't get service for asking. The bartender forgot my order twice. The third visit it was half empty- plenty of tables. Upon checking in I was told "It will be a while since they only have 3 servers and are too busy". Ok what's a while? "I don't know". For a place only half full this is terrible service. This place will not survive like this. I like the food but the owners should really fix the service issue and long wait times.
