I've been here about a dozen times... Staff is always on point. Food is always fantastic. They create a good atmosphere. We keep coming back. And there's something to be said about that.

I called around to at least 6 different places looking for a specific snare all to no avail. When I got Ron on the phone he was willing to take the time and recommend a couple different snares he carried which got me into his shop. I ended up buying one of his recommendations and I couldn't be happier. This man truly cares and is dedicated to his craft. Don't go to Guitar Center or any of those 'big box we don't give a sh*t' type places. Support local. Go see Ron.

It pains me to write a negative review for LYFT... I've used their service in many states for about two years.... But it seems like they're slipping. I've recently encountered long wait times and rude service. Things I was used to dealing with cabs.....  I will no longer recommend them and hope that PHX makes something like 'ride-share' a possibility, outside of LYFT.
