Beware of a residential property being represented by Osselaer. They slow with inquiries and paperwork and will nitpick you on move out with a good amount of fees. Seriously, who charges you for leaving a satellite dish?

I scheduled over email to get a piece of replacement trim matched and painted after I had damaged the original on a road trip. I was able to drop everything off in the morning and everything was done by evening. Piece looks flawless. Staff was helpful and courteous!

Larry did an outstanding job on both tinting my windows on my new Focus RS as well as applying SunTek PPF. The windows are flawless and the PPF is barely noticeable. He went over everything he was going to do to make sure I was getting exactly what I wanted. I'll be taking my next car to Accu-tint!

What can be said about Bianco that hasn't been said before? Pizzeria Bianco has been raved about for many years now, with good reason! Chris Bianco has built his establishment into a Phoenix staple. Every visit I'd say well over half of his clientele is brand new, no small feat since he's spent 14 years in the same location. To say the least, Pizzeria Bianco is a well-reviewed, well-loved and die-hard restaurant.  Put this into perspective: I've patronized Pizzeria Bianco roughly 40-50 times (many of those times have been in post-100 degree heat, non-coincidentally the Bar Bianco next-door opens an hour earlier than the Pizzeria so grab a beer) and each time I've waited 1-2 hours for the privilege. Are there many places in the whole world where you'd do that? Once you taste the sensation within, you'll understand.  The pizzas are wood-fired in a brick oven and until recently, they'd all been fired and created by one man, Chris Bianco, whom forcefully had to take a leave of absence from his dedication to his craft. Why? All the wood smoke and flour dust has taken a toll on him over the years and irritated his asthma to a point where his doctor insisted that he stay out of the kitchen if he wanted to live into his 50s. It may seem silly to an outsider but to see Chris's passion for what he does, you'd instantly empathize.  The creations that come from the oven are simple, yet complex in flavor and texture. They're thin-crust Italian style pizzas that are true to the heart of Tuscany and Roma. In true Italian spirit, less is more on the pizza with only a few ingredients playing on the stage. My favorite at Bianco is to order a Margarita pizza and add mushrooms and perhaps some garlic. What returns is amazing. You wouldn't think that dough, tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil, Criminis and garlic could formulate something so flavorful and distinct but there it is.  A favorite before the pizza is unquestionably an Antipasto plate! Familiar ingredients grace the plate almost every time (mushrooms, sopressata, olives and parmesan) with one or two guest players (eggplant parm or roasted red pepper). Given a health dose of olive oil and graced in the oven, the plate comes to you a variety of textures and tastes.  There are a few salads offered as well. The pizza, antipasto and salads comprise the entire menu. It's simple but elegant in a setting at Heritage Square that makes it a true, one-of-a-kind experience and completely unique to Phoenix. Yes, you need some time to kill (I recommend getting there at least an hour before opening) and the ability to tolerate weather and a few line cutters, but you will be rewared with what has been called and I whole-heartedly agree is the "best pizza in America".

Delux is a somewhat-trendy hangout where you can easily make getting a burger and a beer part of your weekly routine. The atmosphere is sleek and chatty, with a distinct focus on their wide-range of beers on-tap that lines the bar area and a large communal table in the center of the restaurant. Delux rotates seasonal specialties into their beer selection so you're always either trying something new or enjoying an old favorite.  When it comes to the food at Delux the obvious choices are between one of two burgers, the Delux Burger or the Standard Classic. Both are BIG patties of meat that are recommended to be cooked to the rarer side. Which ever you decide on, it's sure to be filling and delicious, especially when paired with a basket of mixed (regular and sweet-potato) fries.  Much can be said about Delux's alternative sandwiches however. The vegetable panini and turkey burgers are flavorful, lighter alternative to the heavy burger. Delux's gazpacho soup is perfect for cooling down in the summer heat or anytime as a small snack.   Service is happy and usually snappy. Prices are reasonable though have risen steadily over the past few years (but where hasn't?). If it's past 10pm and dinner has still yet to be eaten, the choice to go to Delux is a no-brainer! Overall, a great place to frequent in the valley!

The artsy section of Phoenix definitely has its share of small, lively dining spots and, to me, the place that embodies the spirit of the art culture here the best is The Roosevelt. Patrons flood into the place during First Fridays (as everywhere else in the area) so I wouldn't recommend making that day your first experience here.   Converted from an old house (again, like most in the area) The Roosevelt can get cramped and crowded in short order. Usually weekday nights are fairly easy to nestle into and get a spot at the bar or one of the other seating areas in the various tiny rooms. All these allusions to the size of the place might seem negative but in truth, it's one of its greatest charms. The result is a cozy, personal venue for mingling with your neighbor and enjoying The Roosevelt's culinary delights.  The Roosevelt offers mostly snacking fare but combined can easily add up to a meal. They have a handful of sandwiches that are served grilled panini style. Highly recommended is the "Sweet Moses" roast beef sandwich or if you're feeling more adventurous and love Italian-style deli-meats, go for the "Norcino". The  "Greens" are a good accompaniment for some vege complete with baked goat-cheese or if you want more meat, try the "Pan Del Padre" (chorizo topped with cheese on bread). If you're just in a snacking mood, try the "Dips" (awesome Maytag Bleu and Onion dips) or a soft pretzel.  Thursday nights offer a treat: Pasta Night! One pasta is cooked up per Thursday and usually involves a cream sauce and some type of meat like sausage or chicken. I usually don't care what it is, it's all good! I've never had a bad pasta experience there.  One of the highlights of the experience is their chalk board, a listing of today's rotating taps (frequently changed brews), cheeses (for the fantastic cheese plate) and wines. They usually go for heavier, stronger beers on the rotating tap that make for an adventure in tastes. I really can't say enough good things about cheese plate, it's that good but again, strong tastes are contained within! It's not for the dainty. If you're not up for an on-tap brew, they have an extensive collection of bottled and canned beers and alternative drinks.  The ambiance is really what makes The Roosevelt a true winner, but it's strongly supported by a wonderful kitchen and helpful, knowledgeable staff. It can get busy, but if you can avoid the rush, you'll have a very relaxing and chill time.

A chain restaurant at its peak form. Every Yard House that I've been to has been consistent in its delivery and quality from service to food. Yard House is probably most well known in the areas that it serves for its world-class on-tap beer selection. There really are too many to count, I'd guess close to 100 different beers from all over the world and varied in styles and flavors. Coming in to a Yard House, you'll stroll by their windowed massive refrigerator where all the kegs are kept frostily chilled. It's a sight to behold for any beer lover and few places rival.  But Yard House is not just a bar, it's an excellent full-service restaurant that excels in wide-variety of foods to pair with your selected beer. From appetizers which include a very untraditional Spicy Tuna Roll and excellent, meaty chicken wings to their large sandwiches (Cuban Pork Sandwich is great!) and seafood dishes that include a fantastically prepared Ginger-Crusted Salmon, they do have something for everybody. Prices are affordable for what you get and portions are usually enough to have a little to take home for the next day.  The Yard House is less about one specific thing that sticks in your mind after dining there. It's more about the experience as a whole. The beers flow, the food is eaten and fun is had. I could go over a huge list of things I've had there an enjoyed thoroughly, but it's less important than the general feeling I'm trying to convey that the atmosphere and quality of the Yard House make it a winner anytime no matter what you feel like ordering.

Pita Jungle is an unassuming, relaxed restaurant. The decor and mood are decidedly low-key and menu centers around purportedly healthier foods like hummus, falafel and of course, plenty of pita. Ingredients are typically very fresh and vibrant looking. I can highly recommend any of the hummus appetizers as well as the baba ghanoush. The warm pitas such as the falafel or beef gyro are definite winners being cheap, delicious and filling.  This is a sit-down restaurant but food typically arrives very quickly and you can done with your entire meal in less than 40 minutes. The service at Pita Jungle isn't the place's high point. It's usually friendly but there's a short and rushed feel to it. That's probably due to the great value that Pita Jungle offers. Considering that myself and a companion can eat there with 3 courses for around $20, tips are generally low as well, even if you're tipping 25%.  Overall, the food is good, service is quick and the experience is laid back. It's definitely one of my favored locations in the valley on a budget.

Avoid this one. They're out of one component of every drink. The cashier has no clue how to operate the register to allow electronic payments. They don't communicate things from the cashier to the people making the drinks and they're apparently slow as molasses.

Fogo De Chao was the first churrascaria I had eaten at many years ago back in Dallas. The first time you experience one, you'll understand why the eateries are near and dear to many people's hearts. At these Brazilian steakhouses, gauchos encircle your table to offer you various delectable cuts of beef, lamb, chicken and pork. The format is no-menu, single fee, all-you-can-eat extravaganza.  The price at this Fogo in particular as of this writing here in Phoenix is $42.50 per person, which is a bargain considering the amount and quality of food offered. Once you're seated, you're offered drinks and then you're free to immediately indulge in one of the most high-class 'salad bar' experience you'll ever have. Really, calling it that doesn't do it any justice.  After you've had your fill of vegetation and the like, you may begin the onslaught of meat. There is a small card that is next to you that you flip to 'green' to attract the gauchos and 'red' when you'd like to take a break. Come to Fogo expecting to practice gluttony. You will savor mouth-watering cuts of meat including fillet, top and bottom sirloin, lamb chops, leg of lamb, bacon wrapped fillet and bacon-wrapped chicken, pork sausage and ribs and others. They're all exceptional though you may like some things more than others.  There are a few words of warning. You will consume a lot of food. The meats are highly salted to bring out the most of their flavor and the beef is cooked to the rare side. In short, this is not a health food experience. This is for the meat lover in a meat-eating mood.  You can feel free to intersperse the vegetables at the salad bar while eating the meat. As well, a few sides are provided: garlic mashed potatoes, fried polenta and fried bananas. Fogo has many fine deserts though I tend to stick with the recommended Papaya Cream, which is a lighter fare after consuming pounds of meat.  As for the rest of Fogo, the setting is noisy but gorgeous. There's always a festive atmosphere about the place. With all the hustle and bustle occasionally, you might be overwhelmed and you might be forgotten about for a few minutes... unless your card is 'green'!  Overall, Fogo offers good value for money, an excellent setting and an unbeatable churrascaria experience. Probably my favorite restaurant of all time.

We had a really good experience here yesterday. I was wanting a steak with a little pasta and knew this was a place that did both.  We had our 2 kids with us and it was nice to see their kids menu had more than just mac and cheese. They even got some raw pizza dough to play with.  The ambience is definitely that of a chain restaurant but the food came out extremely fast and didn't overlap. Salads came out nearly instantly after we ordered, kids food shortly thereafter as requested, and after we finished our salads, mains came out promptly.  My fillet was more towards the rare side than medium rare, but flavor and texture were wonderful. Pasta had a bit too fiddly of a sauce but did the job. The butter cake dessert was devoured quickly by our quartet.   Overall, a pretty good meal!

Don't get anything other than a basic wash here. They do an okay job of that for the price on a basic wash. Parts are mostly spot free and you can get out in about 30 minutes.  But you're wasting your money if you get a multi-hundred dollar detail here. If you drop it off and they have your car for hours, they'll still only spend 45 minutes on it. They didn't open the hood at all to get the engine bay or inner door hinges. They lost the cap on my bumper and said they'd give me a call in a day or two about it, but never did.  And whenever they give an estimate of 15 more minutes, they really mean about another hour.

Really, really good Bahn Mi. Vermicelli bowls are excellent and filling as well. Service has been good, with the food coming out pretty quick at lunch time. Only downside to me is they don't take Amex.

These guys were amazingly good! We had a whole family to move out of a 2400ish square foot house and across town. They were all very friendly, super efficient, covered all the furniture, disassembled what they had to and put it back together correctly. They made sure we were happy with the placement of all the major items. I can't remember a move we made that was ever so easy for us on the actual day of the move. This was the most expensive in-town move we've made but that's probably because we have more stuff now and required two trucks. I do feel like we got what we paid for however. I'll definitely be using Poindexter for our next move!
