Received pricing from ADT when we moved into new house, but I had heard so many bad things that I decided to shop around. Bonds has been a great choice! Salesman was professional and on time. We had John install our system, and he was great! He hit a few snags with our system, but smiled the whole time. He was patient while explaining how to use the system and took his time making sure we got what we needed. Thank you so much for being one of the few family owned businesses out there that cares about their customers! HIGHLY RECOMMEND Bonds Alarm!!

Go to Frys. Buy some steak. Cook at home. You'll get better food than at this place. Steaks are not top quality and service was HORRIFIC! Stay away.

I've always had a great experience here. Customer service is very important to these guys and the manager is aware of issues going on and does his best to resolve them. I've brought several a cars here for various reasons, and these guys are always "on it".... Keep it up! :)

Yuck. Food came out on hot plates but it was cold. Long wait only to be seated and wait longer. Wait staff was mediocre. Hit the chipotle next door. Way better and cheaper.

Server was irritated that we were there, she must've had other things to do. She was slow and rude. Dropped our food and never came back. Flagged others down for more coffee and water. Also had to wave her down to ask for check. Service not good, food mediocre. Hash brown casserole is gross.

They have a Bbq buffet on Saturdays that's about $11 per person and oh so worth it! The brisket is tender and delicious and the beers are nice and cold!! Check it out if you're ever in Cave Creek. They were named top western bar in Phoenix Times a few times.

We used to love coming here. But then BWW changed their wing set up and pricing. Now it's super expensive and the wings are teeny tiny. Wait staff is usually angry.

I love this place! Food is always good and fresh and the customer service is always top notch. I love that they have a variety of healthy foods (amazing salads), and not so healthy choices (brownies, they're divine!).... Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack.... they never disappoint!

I have always enjoyed the food at Mimi's Cafe, but this Mimi's in particular is so dirty. It seems like they never clean the decorations on the wall. I happened to touch the back of a booth one time and my hand had gross, greasy accumulated dust/dirt. I let the waitress know and she said they only clean what the manager says to clean. This place could use a good deep scrubbing from top to bottom.

Burrito bowl + guac/chips: yes please. 2 people can eat off that easily. And it's $6/person if so. Not a bad deal!

I love that this is a small mom and pop place. The owner is always so nice, he comes to our table and asks how we are enjoying our food. The HAPPY HOUR drinks are a great deal, and the food is delicious... I highly recommend the DOLMADES... they are creamy and oh so tasty!

I preferred this place when it was at the old location. Now the front room feels so separate and tight from the back room; flow is weird. Also seems they didn't keep the friendly staff they used to have. Instead they hired people with short fuses and nasty attitudes. Food was good but won't be coming back.

Tried this place again. Came for breakfast. Potatoes were call southwestern but were really spicy! Our server was new and had no idea what he was doing. He was nice, but clueless. Friend ordered sugar free chai tea and it had CHUNKS of the chai powder mix still in it. Sent it back, asked for regular tea, never got it. Breakfast deal was $6 - good price but terrible service.

I heard they had Happy Hour all day Sunday so we went to check it out. We normally go to other places, so we decided to try this out. Server was awkward and sushi was not tightly rolled, kept coming undone. There were hardly anyone in there at the time and this should have been number one clue. We got our rolls and dig in! The rolls tasted pretty good, nothing spectacular, but good. It was when we got home a few hours later that my husband and I regretted this outing! Got SUPER SICK! Been up all night, both of us. Ugh. Never going back to this place!

Super yummy, authentic Cuban food. I got the yucca con mojo and the ropa vieja -- neither disappointed. Also tried a few desserts and those were pretty amazing as well!! In a town where Mexican food reigns king, this place is nice, family-run, and authentic Cuban food! Eat here!

Service is oh so so bad! Waited for a good while to be seated on a Tuesday night when no one was there. Then never got menus. After about 15 minutes, we got up and left. No one seemed to care either. They saw us leave. Went over to Buffalo Wild Wings which is in same parking lot.

This is my FAVORITE Starbucks location. Ever! They are always friendly, and orders are accurate and if it's not, they make it right no matter what! The drive thru setup could be better, but the long lines are worth the yummy drinks and friendly staff! :)

Food here is very good. Service? Eh... Not so much. The owners are usually not willing to make things right on the bill based on experience. But the rice at the hibachi tables is really good! The sushi happy hour specials are also very good. But happy hour sushi prices are for dine in only. You pay double if you wanna take it to go.

I am originally from NYC, where the Chinese food reigns supreme... and when I moved out here it was hard to find anything that was even remotely close to good.... While China Red is still not NYC amazing Chinese food, it definitely comes close. The portions are nice and big, the flavors are great, and the hot and sour large soup is fab! They offer lunch specials, which are hard to beat since the price is about $6 for 2 meals worth food :) PLUS, they deliver, which is hard to find out here in AZ!

SUPER fun times on my birthday! You aren't able to drink on the trolley, but they take you to a few different spots to have drinks and fun. Insider tip: the bike has a motor, so really there's no need to pedal at all. Lol. But it was fun figuring that out WHILE drinking! I recommend gathering a big group of friends and booking with these guys. They're really cool dudes!

The smoothies and food is really good!! But the place is always super gross and dirty. The employees walk on banana peels, and if you're unlucky enough to look back into the kitchen area, you'll see just how little they clean back there. The employees are all young college kids, and maybe more adult management would help. I was pretty grossed out the last time I went there. Haven't been back since.

Save your money and time. Overpriced gross food. You'll need about a gallon of water after eating here. Not sure if it's too much soy sauce, salt, MSG, or what... But it is not pleasant. They have the worst miso soup I've ever tasted. Steer clear of this place.

HOLY DELICIOUS DONUTS!! Even the plain glazed ones are yummy. I have never tried their boba drinks, but I hear they are highly recommended! They also have stuffed croissants that are offered in both sweet and savory. Get there early cause they make them fresh everyday and sometimes run out... OMG! How could I forget to advise you to get the BLUEBERRY CAKE donuts... one word: WOWSA!

We love this place! Better to eat in though. If you order to go, by the time you get home, your bread is soggy. I think that's cause they use tin foil to wrap them up. Fries are delicious. They don't have ranch dressing available. Which is odd.

Jason and Gary showed up and were ready to work. They busted their butts moving our super heavy stuff, and were more than willing to set up, build, tear down, whatever we needed. Before our move, I had many interactions with Tristan (one of the owners), he was always super responsive, professional, and a pleasure to deal with. I will definitely be recommending these guys to my friends with moving needs. They were also affordable, honest and fair... Great guys!

Park is always clean and has good walking paths. Wish the splash pad was a little more shaded. And it's known for being down for repairs quite often. But overall we enjoy coming here.

Service was fast and customer service was good. However, the warranty covers very little time, and shortly thereafter, my screen was not as responsive as my original screen. I would hang up on people, add calls, and have lots of difficulty sending texts.... I would recommend spending the extra money and going through original mfr to get screen repaired.

Food isn't worth the long waits. The meat is fatty and flavor is nasty. There are way better bbq places than this one. I would stay away!! We tried it out several times and each time it was equally bad. What a shame. I was excited when I saw signs for this place.

Zero stars. Didn't eat here cause after standing by hostess station for 15 minutes, decided to leave. The waitresses saw us, but never even acknowledged us - the 6 tables they were serving must've been too much to handle as it was. There were a few other people who walked in and waited behind us. They too left.   My prediction is this place will not last unless they up their service!

Food was "ok".... Service is always terrible at this place. Not sure why. Asked for high chair, was given one with broken latch, waited forever to get it replaced, finally husband grabbed one for us. Ordered French toast sticks for toddler, they were deep fried until black and so hard that baby couldn't chew at all. Sent them back. But only After waving the manager down since server never came back! Waited another 10 mins for coffee refill, server came back with attitude after manager took food off bill. Never going back.

Reviewing this place AGAIN! And guess what, nothing has changed. I give this place 1 star cause it's the lowest allowable. I'm not sure why this location (Haymaker, formerly Caballeros, and before that MCarthys), always has bad service!! I think it's been all diff owners, but it's always disappointed me in regards to service. The food is basic, service horrid. Rude hostess, waitress had no knowledge of menu).

Wish I could I give zero stars!! Half the menu was "unavailable at this time"... Food we got was overlooked, lettuce was old, service was bad and super slow and servers have no idea what the items on the menu even ARE! This place won't last. Such a shame cause I love Mediterranean food. You're better off going to Dino's down the street. They have good authentic Greek food. Stay away from Zetas.

When I gave this place one star due to bad service and gross food the owner reached out to me and called me negative and was extremely unprofessional and rude. Just confirms my dislike of this place even more!! I had a party of 5 with me and no one else liked their food either.   (See Mr. Mahdi: I'm not promoting another business -- just reviewing your place as fairly as possible)....

Ordered XL pizza, wings, and garlic knots. The pizza is thinner than I expected, but it was a flavor explosion! Really really good! The garlic knots comes with a little container of marinara sauce... Let's just say I would drink this sauce if they'd given me more... yummmm. The wings were ok. They don't have a deep fryer, so the skin never gets really crispy unless you char them... But that's more of a preference thing for me. Overall, will definitely be back... Staff was SUPER FRIENDLY!!!!

This place used to be a run of the mill nail salon, then POOF, it was remodeled into a super hipster, slick place... However, the spendy price list does not match the attitudes of the manicurists. The skill is also not great: I had a pedicure that looked like my 4 year old had done it. I complained to have the nail polish redone and they said they would just clean it up, which made it even worse. Drove home, took off polish and did it myself... This was after paying $55 for mani/pedi. Pass!

Was very dissatisfied with initial visit and posted a review sharing my experience. The manager or owner emailed me and asked to make it right by offering a complimentary meal. Sent him mailing address and then never heard back. Followed up with several other email communications and still never heard back. It's been MONTHS and about 3-4 emails and nothing. Management is right in line with the bad service I received the first time. Stay away!!!!
