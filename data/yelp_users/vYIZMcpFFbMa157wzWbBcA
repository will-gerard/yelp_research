For a long time, I have been hearing great things about this place. We finally had a chance to go in the not-too-distant past, and we were not disappointed.  I had heard that this is one of the few places in AZ that serves authentic Japanese food, primarily Japanese-style Ramen. Since being back in America after living in Japan, Japanese Ramen is probably the thing I miss the most. Well, after the wonderful people, of course! I know it is not originally a Japanese dish, but the Japanese style of Ramen is just the best! :) Oh, and GYOZA!! Of course!  Of course, when we went to Cherryblossom, I definitely had to have some Ramen. It was excellent, as promised! My husband had some sushi since he loves the stuff, and it was pretty similar to decent Japanese sushi. I think they had "American sushi" choices as well, which is pretty different. :)  Overall, it was a lovely experience. The environment was very nice as well. It was great to see some Japanese stuff on the walls and around the restaurant. It was pretty busy in there as well. My only complaint is that we didn't get to interact with any Japanese employees, so we could not practice our Japanese! :( There is always next time... :) Maybe we will have to sit at the sushi bar!

This is my favourite Pier 1 Imports location in the Phoenix area, especially for the West Valley... much nicer than the Surprise location, too! The store is a bit larger, the employees are friendly and helpful, they have an excellent selection, and they always have plenty of clearance items! :) Actually, before going to this Pier 1 location, I would've never thought about writing a Yelp review for one... they were all pretty standard and similar to one another. The Goodyear store definitely impressed me, though!

I was having work done on my car at Japanese Automotive, and Don over there recommended the Great Wall for lunch. It wasn't very busy, and we actually didn't even see the restaurant at first. We were finally able to spot it, so we parked and went in. On our way up to the front door, my stepdad noticed that there were no windows, just a great wall ;)  Now, it doesn't exactly look like much, but we had excellent service and the food was very good. We all had iced tea, and I think they were over giving us refills before we could even realize we needed any more. It also looked like they did some fun stuff during busier times, and seemed like it could be more than just a restaurant. I'm sure the regular customers have a great time if anything special and fun happens :)  Also, while the main area of the restaurant looked pretty standard, I was pleasantly surprised when I went to the restroom. I wasn't expecting such a nice restroom there! They must have recently remodeled at least the men's restroom, as I cannot speak about what the women's restroom looks like. :P  Overall, we had a nice lunch and a great experience there. The price was also very good!

As far as smaller venues go for concerts, the Martini Ranch has always been enjoyable. The employees are always friendly and I've always had a good time whenever I go there. We went again recently (it has been quite a while since I've been there) and it was still just as awesome. I don't remember it being that big, but I could be wrong. It's still pretty small, but it didn't seem as small this time around. I think the size is just right, though.  The drinks weren't exactly reasonably priced, but they were strong at least. Maybe too strong... :P  As always, Martini Ranch did not disappoint. It always leads to a good time :)

This location was unexpectedly large. From the parking lot, I would expect this to be the smallest Pita Jungle location I'd ever seen! However, once you get inside, the restaurant is much larger than expected. It was still packed and busy at lunch time, but I think that has been similar to any other Pita Jungle I've ever been to.  I met my fiance here for lunch one day, and we were quite satisfied (as usual). Nothing spectacular that sets this location apart from the rest, but it didn't disappoint either. We love Pita Jungle, though, so maybe we're a bit biased! I love how each location is different from the others, too. I loved the style inside the restaurant, although the vibe was a bit hampered by the noise level from our fellow diners. They were playing music, but I could barely hear it over all of the talking!  Other than that, no complaints. We had some delicious mango iced tea and our food was quite good. :)

Been back a few times since, and have had nothing but great experiences. Our last visit was awesome because it was later on Saturday night and wasn't very busy at all. Our waiter was really... chill? Lol! I don't really know what adjective to use for him. He was really quiet and reserved, but he was also one of the best waiters ever. Tons of refills, he was there when we needed him, and there was no forced small talk or unnecessary words. It's like he could see into our souls. Almost like he knew us better than we knew ourselves :O  I have no idea what his name was but yeah, he was pretty awesome. The passion fruit iced tea was pretty good, and he even offered iced teas to go before we even thought of asking for any. Yeah, I pretty much peed a lot that night... way too much tea! (If there is such a thing!)  That last experience really prompted me to bring this up to a 5 star rating. I love Pita Jungle, but other locations usually annoy me a bit. This one is just too awesome :)

I'm giving this restaurant a full 5 stars because they definitely earned it.  I must admit, though, that the food was not necessarily memorable. From what I can remember, it was decent and I felt perfectly fine the next day. Not sure what previous reviewers ordered there, but my stuff was fine! Unfortunately, it was not necessarily memorable either... Although I did have this cool rice soup (?) what was extremely steamy and came out sizzling! They had decent plum wine and hot green tea, too :)  What really made us enjoy this place was the service, though. We came for a friend's birthday, and her sister originally planned for Oregano's. However, when we all *finally* found parking at Oreganos, we found out that there was an extremely long wait time (it's always packed, and I don't believe they take reservations there.) Also, there was a huge fight between some customer and the staff at Oregano's, which kind of scared us away. Since we had a relatively large group, we figured it would pretty much be midnight by the time we actually got any food--and we were starving!  Luckily, our birthday friend is not a huge fan of crowds, so she pointed out Little Szechuan across the street. We all wandered over there to find that it was pretty empty, but it was also close to closing time (which we discovered later and felt very bad about--but they never complained or rushed us in the restaurant, and were nothing but kind to us the entire time!)  We had a great time and were able to relax and enjoy ourselves. There was no stress, and our server/lady who runs the place was extremely friendly. She almost became a part of our birthday celebration :) Very kind and charismatic lady, as others have noted on here.   Overall, we definitely enjoyed this place. The food was nothing extraordinary, nor was the restaurant itself in terms of space or decor, but it definitely had its charms and we felt very comfortable and welcome the entire time... even if we did stay way past the time they were closed. :)

You know what? This was probably the coolest thrift store we've ever visited in the Phoenix Metro area! Much nicer than visiting a Savers or Goodwill, in my opinion. The prices were great, it was very clean and organized, and it didn't smell as bad as I'm used to! I usually hate going to thrift shops because of the smell. That probably sounds weird, but oh well! ;)  There was a great selection of just about everything, but we ended up not really getting anything at all. We still had fun looking through everything, though. My friend did actually end up getting this really cool solid carved wood pelican that was perfect for her nautical-esque themed room. It's crazy, but it fits her style. It actually isn't as ugly as it sounds, and it was only $1.99. She also told me she went back later and picked up a few more things since they had restocked in the short time after we had left. She also noticed that a few large pieces of furniture had sold in that same amount of time.  The staff was friendly and helpful as well, so that is also a plus. They were quick to get the pelican artwork down for us with a smile. Oh, and I think my friend also was able to find this huge baking sheet (practically brand new for super cheap!) that she is going to use when she decorates her gingerbread cookies during the holidays. I think it's too large for her to use for baking, but she said it will be perfect for her to set the freshly baked cookies on when she is decorating them.  Overall, we were both very satisfied with our journey to Value Village. Since she lives nearby, my friend said she is going to check this place out about once a week.

My mother and several of her friends would always rave about this place. For years, I just never bothered going here because I just don't like the downtown Phoenix area. A few months ago, though, I finally decided to give it a try. Some family members and I met up downtown and were ready to be blown away by some incredible pizza!  We ended up waiting forever-- over two hours-- to get in. This wasn't a huge shock, so I won't really factor that into my review rating. It was a long wait, but we knew that it would be. However, it's what came after the long wait that disappointed us. Once we were finally in, it took forever for our order to come out. We were also split up into three separate groups even though our party wasn't that large. That's fine, too. They were busy and pretty packed, so I understand that.  The pizzas, though, were extremely unimpressive. Even my mother commented on how she did not really enjoy her pizza that much, especially when compared to previous experiences. My pizza was so unexciting that I don't even remember what I had ordered now, which is pretty uncommon for me! It wasn't disgusting, but it was so boring that I can't even recall eating it! I think this sentiment was shared amongst all of us that night. For the price and the hype, it just didn't live up to our expectations.  My mother also mentioned to me that Chris Bianco no longer makes the pizzas because of some allergy he has or something. Perhaps this is why the quality of the pizzas has gone down? I'm not sure, but either way I just wasn't impressed. I was so excited to eat here, too!

My mother-in-law took us here when our friend from Japan was visiting. I would definitely go back! The service was excellent, and the food was, of course, delicious! We had a cheese platter, two pizzas (I don't remember what kind, but they were good!), and awesome drinks. Our server was friendly, had great suggestions, and was very patient with us. Oh, and the atmosphere was great -- very warm and inviting. Overall, we were very satisfied.

I went here for lunch with an old co-worker and our friend who was visiting from Japan.  We all had a great time! No complaints at all. The food and service were great!  I'm sorry that there isn't much to say, but I guess less is more? :)

This place is quite delicious! I went with my entire family one evening, and we were all satisfied. I had a Hummus Plate, which was mostly delicious. Some of the roasted veggies were cold, which I wasn't really happy with. The hummus itself was delicious, though! The Roasted Garlic Tomato Soup was the best Tomato Soup I've ever had in any restaurant, by the way! I think they only serve it on Monday's, so if you're a fan and have the chance... I'd definitely suggest it!

We had a pretty good experience here. They gave us a decent price and washed the car, polished the tires and chrome wheels, vacuumed and shampooed the carpets, and polished the leather. We also chose "New Car" as the scent and they put in the little air conditioning vent things. The scent lasted much longer that way, much better than just spraying crap into the car. We were actually getting ready to sell the car, and they made it look great. The new car smell was actually the only one I've ever smelled that actually did smell like new car... the people who bought the car even mentioned that it smelled new! I thought that was pretty cool, so I'd like to know where they got those air fresheners :)  Other than that, nothing spectacular. We had a good experience, but nothing that made it stand out over other car washes. Nothing to complain about either, though.

I'm glad I'm not the only one reviewing a grocery store... but I just think this Safeway deserves a special shout-out because of how horrible my experiences have been. We moved here about 7 or 8 months ago, and this is the closest grocery store, so obviously we've been there quite a bit. Convenient location, we usually like Safeway, and it has a Starbucks in it. Cool.  Unfortunately, this is probably the worst Safeway I've ever shopped in. I don't know why, but every time I go there is a horrible experience. The employees always seem to be rude, if they even interact with you at all. They all seem to hate their jobs, and I would too if I worked at this location! I definitely don't blame them.   The most annoying part is that whenever I go, no matter what day of the week or time of day, seems to be extremely busy customer-wise. The best part is that I have only ever seen 2 cash registers open MAX, when it was ridiculously busy, but it is usually just 1 lane. As you can imagine, the line gets incredibly long... and on top of this all, each customer seems to take forever to check out. I have no idea where the blame lies here, but it is seriously the slowest service I've ever seen in any grocery store. I don't even know how to describe it... it's just like being in the Twilight Zone or something, and no one else seems to notice here! They act like it's completely normal.  Also, this place used to be clean according to the reviews. It doesn't look that clean to me whenever I go...  We have decided to just go to Fry's or even the Super Target, even though they are farther away from home than Safeway. We HATE Fry's, but the location closest to this Safeway is much better than the Safeway... Hell, I'd even rather go to Wal Mart at this point, and we avoid Wal Mart like the plague! On top of all of this, the Safeway prices are obviously ridiculous. It was fine before because we liked going to our old Safeway so much, but at this location the price is definitely not justified. We can get the exact same stuff elsewhere for cheaper, and not absolutely dread going to get it either :P

Took way too long for just an oil change. They acted as if bringing in 2 cars (which we had made 2 separate appointments for well in advance, AND arrived ~30 min. early) was a major inconvenience. They kept trying to get us to take one and drive around in it, then come back with the other one after the first was done. LOL? Oh, and the price wasn't too great either, but it was nearby and convenient.  The advantage to waiting so long was that we got to try out Black Bear Diner for the first time.

I have avoided all of the Black Bear Diners I've seen over the years for some reason, but I finally got to try it out at this location. I'm sad I didn't do so sooner... much better than Village Inn, Denny's, Waffle House, and IHOP! (Among all of the other restaurants just like them... minus Cracker Barrel, which is still my favourite!)  We decided to walk down here while waiting for oil changes at Brake Masters, and they weren't busy at all because of the strange time we decided to eat out of boredom (3:30pm-ish, I think.) It was the best option we had within walking distance in the area, even though I had always avoided/dreaded going there for some reason. However, I remembered possibly seeing something on Yelp about them being good, and like I said... best option in the area :P So, we went in, ordered our food, had great service and great food! Huge portions, and we weren't really that hungry to begin with... we probably could've just shared something if we had known how huge the meals were! :)  Overall, good price, good service, and good food. I would recommend this place, especially given its competition in the area... although the nearby IHOP actually wasn't that bad. I was forced to eat at that IHOP one day, but was pleasantly surprised :)

We've eaten here and gotten take-out several times, and have always been satisfied. It's nothing spectacular, but the food is still great, the atmosphere inside the restaurant is nice, they are fast and friendly, and the prices are very reasonable. If you're in the Surprise area and want some good Chinese food, I'd definitely give them a try!

They have the address wrong on here. It's actually 1607 N. Dysart Rd., North of the I-10 not South.  I was having work done on my car, so I was actually with my mom when we went. We had just visited Estrella Mountain Community College right down the street from here--I was finishing up my new-hire paperwork (I will be teaching there now :) and my mom is actually going back to add a certificate onto her degree in Criminal Justice. Since she desperately needed her car cleaned and doesn't like to go to these car washes by herself (I don't blame her!) we decided to stop by Full Circle really quick.  We pulled up and told them what we needed. Not one soul approached us about our windshield, like many other reviewers said. Maybe this was their day off? Who knows...   The guys where you pull up were extremely nice and took care of us. They told her they would shampoo her floor mats, wash her car, and then wax it--about an hour of work in total. She thought the price of $29.99 was decent for that, and she also got a $3 military discount. We went over to Pei Wei to eat lunch while we waited.  When we came back to pay, they ended up charging my mom only $13.99 for all the work they had done. We were pretty shocked by that, since we're used to being over-charged rather than under-charged! Again, maybe we just got super lucky, but it worked out well for us. They did a great job, so she tipped them well on top of the great price to make up for our good luck.  Her car ended up looking really great. There was still some dog fur inside, but I know it's hard to vacuum every last fur up. For the price, I wouldn't really complain. I've had much worse vacuuming jobs at other places, like Danny's Car Wash (do they even vacuum at all there?) Funny that that came to mind, because last time I went to Danny's they screwed me over regarding chips in my windshield. Haven't been back since... just thought that was an interesting idea, considering all the windshield horror stories I've seen in other reviews about Full Circle.  One last note-- the air freshener/scent stuff she chose didn't smell like much at all. Just something to keep in mind...  Overall, we had a great experience here. Maybe they've improved after having all of these terrible reviews? It wasn't very busy at all, so maybe we got lucky or they are trying to turn their service around... I couldn't say from first-hand experience since this was my first time going there.

We went late on a weeknight after having a pretty bad day, so I would like to go back another time to fully enjoy the experience. While sushi certainly didn't fix anything, it did make the day a little better to digest. We weren't overly hungry, so we didn't order too much... but their alcoholic drinks were very delicious! They have some neat mixed drinks to try out, so I want to go back and try some more of them out too! I forget what I had, but it was very tasty and very strong, although I didn't notice how strong it was while I was drinking it! :) The sushi itself was also good, and the miso soup was tasty. It wasn't very busy, but then again it was late on a weeknight. Not sure how busy it gets, but it was a nice relaxed atmosphere when we went. Everyone was very nice, and I feel bad because I was not in the best of moods. They were still super nice to me, though! We will be going back ASAP, for sure... and we will bring friends and family, too!

I like Sprouts, and this location is pretty much the same as the rest. Nothing special here, but we've also never had any bad experiences. Some stuff can be pricey for what you get, but we generally go when there is a good weekly ad. They don't always have everything we want, but they have a decent selection.  Oh, and I had no idea this Sprouts was even there for the longest time. I don't even think it was listed in Google Maps, and the store faces a weird direction in the parking lot. Usually Sprouts are easily seen from the main street (in my experience) but I'm glad I finally found this location. It's the closest one out here!

Unfortunately, I have to leave Yan's a 2-star review. We used to go here all the time when we first moved down to Goodyear. It's close to home, and we had heard great things about it. Those turned out to be true--great, fast service, yummy food, nice employees, etc. However, the last 3 or 4 times ended up being not so great at all. At first, we just thought it was a fluke. Then, the 2nd time, coincidence? After that, we have decided that we will probably not go there again unfortunately :( Sad, because we used to love Yan's! We aren't sure what happened, but here are the negatives we've experienced lately:  We ALWAYS get the Crab Rangoons with our meals every time. (By the way, we always call in and order take-out rather than eating there since it's so close to home.) They are usually great with the sauce they come with, but the last 3-4 times have not been so great. One time, they forgot to give us the sauce, which we did not notice until we had started eating our food. They are difficult to eat without sauce ;) The next few times, we had sauce, but it was extremely runny and seemed watered down... literally. The taste was completely diluted and different, as if they had run out or something and wanted to re-use what they had left. Not good :( The fact that it happened more than once is concerning.  We always call in and order it as take-out, and they tell us 10-15 minutes (or something along those lines.) We always arrive at the expected time, or sometimes a little later, and walk in to pick it up. At first, they were a few minutes later than expected, but lately it seems like they don't even put the order in until we walk into the restaurant. When I say "seems like," I mean we ask for our order, and they tell the cooks to make it right in front of us. Ok, so why did we call in and order over the phone if we could have just saved ourselves the phone call and just walked in to order? So we sit and wait for the ~15 minutes while they make our order. This is totally fine, because it is fresh and usually good food, but it takes twice the amount of estimated time (and again, why even bother calling in if they don't put the order in until you arrive??!) This has happened several times now, not just once or twice.  The same dishes we used to love at Yan's don't seem to be of the same quality they used to be. They aren't as flavourful, and the meat seems to be very "fatty" at times. It wasn't always like this... It just seems like corners are being cut to make an extra buck. I know that "times are tough" right now, as much as I hate to keep saying that, and that most businesses are struggling right now, but it's just sad to see it happen right in front of us. We used to love going here, but now we just don't feel like spending the money if we are not satisfied. Hopefully it changes back to being a great place, but until then I have to leave then a 2-star review.

Since this location is right down the street from our house, we always go there. We've never been disappointed with anything here, and we absolutely love going! Everything is so delicious, even the Green-V! It took me a while to try it, but I'm glad I finally did... so even their veggie juices are good :)  Everything else, of course, is also delicious. Our favourites include the Hummingbird, Pomegranate Power, and Caja Cooler. We used to love Jamba Juice, but now we can't go back there haha. It's probably the employees and the owner, though... everyone is just so nice there, and very helpful if you have any questions about any of the drinks.  Keep up the great work, guys! Definitely as good as it gets!

My mom kept telling me about this new Chinese restaurant that opened, so I finally met her for lunch there. She is taking classes at Estrella Mountain Community College and I teach English classes there, so this restaurant was conveniently located for us to meet up for lunch! :) It's just up the street, and the service is fast!  It seemed like most people were ordering take-out, as we were pretty much the only 2 people dining in. Another man came in and had lunch by himself, and as we were leaving a family was coming in to eat there. All others were take-out orders, but there were quite a few of them! Always a good sign, I think. The lovely lady who took care of us (I forget her name) seemed to be running the entire joint, and did pretty much everything aside from cooking our food. She was the only employee we saw the whole time, and she was acting as a hostess, a waitress, and was taking phone calls for take-out orders in between it all. To top it all off, she was also extremely polite and made sure we were happy/taken care of! Lots of refills, lots of visits to see how we were doing/how the food was, etc. We were very pleased with our service, and I was impressed with how busy she was. I don't think she stopped moving the whole time we were there, and she still had a smile on her face :)  My mom has been there several other times and noticed no difference in service than what I've just described. During busier times in the dining area (dinnertime on weekends, for example) they have observed the same quality and speed of service that we did during the not-so-busy weekday lunchtime. My little brother even liked it, and he's pretty picky! ;) I definitely recommend this place if you're in the area.

This was the second Pita Jungle I've been to, but it is also the one I've visited most frequently since I used to live nearby. It always seems busy, but it doesn't get too loud inside. The service has always been great, and they always get us in quickly no matter how busy they are. I like the openness of the dining area, and the vibe is always nice. The food is always great, too! We've never had any problems here at all, and were always satisfied with our experiences at this Pita Jungle location :) Oh, and this was the location where I first tried PJ's Spanakopita... it is quite delicious! It almost reminded me of being back in Greece!

See Spot Clean is the best in the area for sure! They are very friendly, helpful, do a great job, and the prices are very good (in my opinion!) We bring our Pomeranians here, and they are definitely a tough breed to take care of. They are terrified of going to get groomed, but that would happen no matter where we took them ;) I'm just glad I know they are getting taken care of here--I don't have to worry about them at all!   The grooming options are great here, and I especially love the different levels: just a regular grooming, a grooming + trim, or a grooming + full haircut. Many other places don't really specify this up front, or you have to request it specifically... but Pomeranians should not have full haircuts/be shaved because their fur never grows back the same. Obviously, their fur is a very important characteristic of the breed, so I was so glad to see the option for just a trim of the sanitary areas, feet, etc. (Where we used to take them did this for us too, but we had to specifically ask ourselves every time--it wasn't a listed option. We always had to mention it several times just in case, because my mom took her sheltie there once and asked for just a slight trim and they shaved her down completely...)  So, overall, See Spot Clean is incredible. They listen to you as a customer, they make sure your pets are taken care of, you get what you ask and pay for, and the prices are GREAT!!! I even love the bandannas they put on your pets after grooming... even though our pups rip them off ASAP :) Hey, at least it looked cute while it lasted.

Takamatsu's may not look like much from the outside, but inside is just fine! The staff is always extremely friendly and competent. They even remember our favorite sushi and drink choices; maybe we go a little too often? :)  Sure, the sushi is more "American," but most places that serve sushi are the same in this regard. However, Takamatsu's sushi is awesome! We took our friend, who was visiting from Japan, here and she said "This is not sushi, but it's delicious!"   Their Korean food is also very good, of course! The prices are great, the service is fast and excellent, and the drinks are also strong and tasty. The bonus to all of this is that it isn't usually very busy, so you almost have the place to yourself sometimes.  Awesome place! I would highly recommend giving it a try if you're in the area and looking for a relaxed atmosphere, good food, good sushi, and great customer service.

We've been here quite a few times, and it's a pretty good location. I'd say it's about the same as all of the other locations I've been to, though... nothing special, but it's nothing worse either.  The only complaint I've had is that their iced tea doesn't seem that good here. I'm a tea snob though, as I love all types of tea hot and cold. Could just be me... but the same flavours at other locations seemed to taste better, and this has been several occasions that I've noticed.  Also, as for the changes at Paradise, that is happening at all locations... another company bought them out and are changing things slowly but surely. Oh, and I still don't like their cookies.... and I love cookies! I just have never liked Paradise cookies for some reason, even though everyone always claims how delicious they are :P

This HomeGoods location is pretty awesome, and one of my favourite places to pick up random crap! We got an amazingly soft and awesome-looking huge rug there for a great price, as well as lots of random glass vases, plates, crystal pieces, and even Voss (also at a good price compared to other places, and it's my favourite water... I feel so ridiculous when I drink it!)  This store does not always have the best selection, but that is definitely understandable. They still have a great selection most of the time, though! It is also one of the cleanest stores I've ever shopped in. It's very organized, which I like. We've found a few cool things in their clearance areas too, such as a little rubbish bin made up of rolled magazines. Definitely an awesome place if you like lots of random things!  Oh yeah, and it's attached to TJMaxx... which is also the cleanest TJ I've ever been in. They don't really have a huge selection over there, so I usually don't get anything, but I've found a few cool shirts for a great price. Oh yes, and the employees here are always awesome! I rarely pay attention to name tags, but the only one I do remember is Chaz. He's awesome, along with all the others who I have not been creepy enough to read the name tags of! :)

This place is very clean, the staff is usually friendly, and it is never busy here. I don't think anybody knows it's here yet! We love going for that reason. MUCH better than the Target up on Litchfield and McDowell, plus we live so close to this Super Target that it is super convenient. We even shop for groceries sometimes... not a bad selection, and their prices are decent for that stuff. They have lots of clearance grocery items sometimes too, which kind of sounds gross but it's not because they are close to being expired or anything. :) I think they just sometimes have a surplus and need to get rid of the stock.   Overall, pretty standard Target review stuff... but it does stand out because it's clean, checking out is fast and easy, and it's never that busy. We would even go here if we lived closer to the other Target, just because it's a much better experience. We like Target in general, but we avoid the Litchfield/McDowell location because it's an annoying place to visit :P This location is much better!!!

After a very nerve-wracking interview for a position in Japan held in Downtown Phoenix on a Friday night, my family decided it might be a good idea to head over to Sens to help me relax. Seems appropriate, right? Well, we were huge fans of the old Fate restaurant before they changed it into some commercialized abomination... luckily,  we had heard that Johnny Chu started a couple of other places that had been left untouched. Fans of Mr. Chu, we decided to give Sens a try, hoping that all of those great times at Fate could be revived ;)  While Sens certainly isn't the same, it was still a breath of fresh air. It is definitely unique and innovative, and definitely not traditional... but that's okay too! The prices were a bit high, but for 4 of us we were actually surprised by how "cheap" the final bill was. It wasn't really cheap, but way cheaper than we had anticipated.  We had some GREAT drinks, one of which was a very strong Japanese vodka infused with Lychee fruit. I don't think I really would order it again, but it was pretty good! Just not my type of drink... extremely strong-tasting!   For food, since they do mostly "family style" dishes where everyone at the table shares, we all ordered a few different things to try out. Pretty much everything except for the riblets was great! I don't really like pork or beef anyway, but these were especially unappealing to me. However, the Wagyu (Japanese beef) they served was very tasty, and I usually hate beef! We got our own binchotan grill, but the waiter helped us out with cooking the beef since we had never done it before.  Other than that, I can't really remember the names of what we ordered... but it was all good! (Except for those riblets...) The staff was awesome, it wasn't too busy, very small but comfortable, and the DJ was pretty awesome. He was a really nice guy, and I think he did some DJing at Fate a few years ago too. Not sure though. The music was also pretty cool!

I suppose this goes for any Rubio's location, but why so expensive? Way overpriced for what you get. I'd rather pay the same amount, or less, in a real restaurant. Also, we always had hit or miss service here... sometimes good, sometimes not so great. As for the food, well, it wasn't that memorable. Well, since we're stuck out here in AZ, I guess this is the closest we can get to the real thing?

For my aunt, mother, and husband, I got them all massages/facials through some deal where they were half off. Hey, why pay more for something if you can get a discount? :) I didn't go myself because I have an issue with people I don't know touching me, but I dropped everyone off after lunch and did some shopping. Afterwards, they all said it was amazing... Well, except for my mom who wasn't too thrilled with her massage therapist. Overall, they still had a great experience and left the place feeling great (and looking ridiculous! Ridiculously relaxed, anyway haha.) The places was extremely nice inside too, and very relaxing. My husband and I will be going back soon since we've been working out quite a bit... our muscles will probably need it! I MAY be able to get over the strangers touching me thing... LOL

You know, this was one of my favorite Pei Wei experiences... they got the food out fast even though it was lunch time and they were pretty busy. The service was also great on top of that. The lady we ordered from even gave us the "To Go" cups rather than the hard plastic ones, which I always have to request at other locations. She did it before I even had a chance to ask! She said that she was psychic ;)  Their iced tea was delicious, as usual. The food was also great, but no better or worse than other locations. I really don't like to review chain restaurants like this, but this particular location stood out a bit from the rest.

This location was pretty awesome when we went for lunch one day. We went there before Blu Sol Massage and Spa since it was nearby, but my husband assured me that it was incredible (he goes to one near his work in Tempe sometimes.)   We ordered, the employees were nice, the food came out pretty quickly, and they have sweet potato fries! I usually hate hamburgers, but I actually enjoyed the Smashburger I had. I can't even remember what I ordered though, other than the delicious sweet potato fries :P  Oh, they also have bottled root beer there too. I'm not sure if that's common knowledge, but I thought it was pretty cool :)  Overall, great service, great food, and it was a pretty stress-free lunch. I felt pretty relaxed there, which is definitely a good sign. Usually I feel uncomfortable when I go out to eat at places like this!

We like Cost Plus generally, but we never usually go there. Prices are high unless stuff is on sale, and not much we really need from there... but they do have some awesome stuff! Especially back in the foods/coffees/wines/beers section :)  Lately, however, we've discovered that Total Wine has all of our alcoholic needs satisfied for a much better price. However, Cost Plus is close to home and we love to just visit sometimes... even if we don't really buy much there. They do a ton of wine tasting weekends here too, and they even had a cool event right after Thanksgiving where they gave away free movie tickets and ornaments to the first 100 customers of the day. We arrived pretty late in the morning and still got our ornament/tickets because not that many people shop at this location :)  The wine tasting weekends are where it's at though. The employees here are awesome--extremely polite and friendly, and it doesn't even seem fake! :) They seem to actually enjoy their job, and it doesn't really feel like they are being forced to talk to the customers like at some places (Starbucks, for example... they are literally forced to strike up a conversation with customers by upper management. I feel so bad for them because most customers want no interaction whatsoever... like me :P) But yes, even though I don't really like talking to people when I'm out and about shopping, I actually do feel inclined to make eye contact with these employees, smile back at them, and respond in whatever way the social situation requires me to do.   Nice location though. We love going here :)

I've only been here once, but it was an awesome experience. I'd definitely go back!  While my husband and I have always enjoyed Indian food, we haven't had a lot of experience with it in the past. Phoenix probably isn't really the best place for eating authentic Indian Cuisine, anyway.   However, after living in Japan, they surprisingly had many Indian restaurants in our city that were owned by immigrants from different parts of India. We loved going to these places, and a bonus was that the employees always spoke English!! :P We also visited Thailand, which of course had many incredible Indian restaurants--definitely a good thing since they had a lot of vegetarian options! However, after eating all of this delicious curry and naam from abroad, we couldn't go back to what we were used to... I couldn't even eat the Japanese-style curry anymore.  Naturally, when we got back, I had the urge to eat some curry and naam... so I did a Yelp search to find the best Indian food in the area. Up came India Garden, which I was a bit surprised about because I've driven past it so many times and it didn't look like anything special from the outside. It doesn't look bad at all, but the name and the storefront are rather generic...  I'm so glad we decided to give it a try, though, because inside is awesome!!! They also have a decently-priced lunch buffet, but I hate buffets... I don't like other people breathing over or touching my (potential) food :P I might give it a try though, since they seem very clean at India Garden! Plus, it might be fun to try some new stuff.  We went here for dinner and loved everything we had. Unfortunately, we ordered too much and couldn't finish it all -- this is something I feel really guilty about. We took the leftovers though, but... it's just never the same reheated! :P However, next time we go, I know that the portions are pretty large!!! :) Their drinks were great too. We just had tea (I think... can't remember) but I believe they had a full bar. I can't really remember, though. The staff was also excellent, and it wasn't too busy inside.   Overall, we had a wonderful experience here and would definitely go back!

I would say that this place is deserving of a good, solid 4 stars. It really didn't blow me away, but it was much better than most places for sure.  First, I must say that my family and I are huge fans of Chef Johnny Chu and used to frequent the restaurant "Fate," which used to be located in what is now Bliss ReBAR. However, I believe a few years ago another company bought out Fate and turned it into something else which is obviously no longer there, and for good reason -- I went there once but it was just not the same experience. It was a very watered down version of what Fate had used to be. I'm truly glad that something good has come of this once-quaint little house in downtown Phoenix!  The staff was very friendly, the atmosphere lovely, and the place still has its charms. The food and drinks were decently priced and delicious. We all had breakfast items, I believe, since it was a late Sunday morning brunch for us. We were able to come right in and sit down immediately as it wasn't too busy. They also had some drink deals for Sunday morning, including a really good, spicy Bloody Mary. It was decently strong, too!   I had the French Toast with Pretzel Bread; I usually hate French Toast, but it was very delicious here. The bacon was good too. My husband shared it with me, and I had some of his omelet which was also delicious. We also shared an order of the coconut chicken strips with the rest of the table. I believe someone wanted to have a fancy version of chicken and waffles for breakfast! :) These were very good as well. I was also able to try some breakfast nachos and was happy with those as well.  Our server was very endearing. He was very friendly and helpful, and it seemed like the other staff members were as well. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience, and I would dine here again. :)

Holy cow... we had the worst experience here! The one up in Surprise was a million times better!  First of all, we walked in with a party of four on a Friday night and they looked at us like we were crazy. The lovely gal up front asked if we had a reservation, and of course we did not. They weren't very busy at all for a Friday night, but she acted as if they were completely swamped. She informed us that it would be a 20 minute wait like it was the end of the world, but of course to us that seemed very reasonable. I guess we're just used to going to busier restaurants on the weekends?  Anyway, the wait actually took over 45 minutes--definitely more than double her initial guess. Whatever, we were able to grab a few drinks before happy hour was over so we were happy. The bar was actually the busiest part of the restaurant, and their service was fast and friendly. However, the rest of the place definitely took away from our positive initial experience there.  We were finally seated in the normal dining area and had the slowest, most forgetful waiter ever. I also noticed that the Hibachi area of the restaurant had barely anyone in it, so maybe that's why it took so long to get in. Everyone was trying to get into the smaller, normal restaurant section! :P We just wanted a nice regular meal with a regular waiter that night, but unfortunately our experience wasn't so great.  We all asked for waters, and the waiter brought one. Gee, thanks. Communal water? LOL. He also kept forgetting things we'd ask for, so we actually had to ask other waiters/waitresses on THREE separate occasions for things that our waiter didn't bring. We would've reminded him, but he seemed to disappear for long periods of time after forgetting things. He also seemed to know whenever we were complaining about him, because he would show up immediately after. 6th sense for unhappy customers? :)  Now, for the food... I had seafood kabobs, and they were okay. However, two of us had scallops in our meals and they were not cooked correctly. I know it's hard to cook them correctly, but these were just bad. The rest wasn't bad, but nothing great either... especially for the price.  Oh, I think the biggest part that bothered me was the location of the restrooms. It was right next to the kitchen, so it was constantly busy with waiter traffic. This is fine, but the attitude of said traffic was what bothered me. The first time, three waiters almost ran into me on my trip to the restroom. They just looked at me as if I was in the wrong place, and of course I said "excuse me." They didn't say anything... just looked at me and went around. On my second trip to the restroom, three waiters/waitresses were standing in the hallway just talking to one another, blocking the entire walkway. I walked up and stood there, finally saying "Excuse me, I have to get to the restroom." One girl moved to the side a little bit, but the guy standing in the middle had his arms crossed with his elbows sticking way out and didn't even acknowledge me. I had to maneuver around his impertinent elbows in order to fit through the tiny gap the one kind waitress had made for me. Basically, I was thinking "WTF?!"  When we were done eating, after we had paid the bill, we then realized that we had been there for over 3.5 hours. Ridiculous! The service was extremely slow and mostly unfriendly, the food wasn't good for the price we paid, and we just ended up being pissed off in general after leaving. This was our first trip to this Hayashi, but we wanted to try it out after having so many fantastic experience up at the Surprise location. I guess the name is the only thing these 2 locations have in common.

This TJMaxx/Home Goods location is awesome! It is always super clean and organized, the employees are extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful, and the selection is excellent. I've found so many things I was looking for, and then some, here! TJMaxx is already my favourite chain store of this type (better than Ross, Marshalls, etc.. imho), but this location is even better! The prices are always great, and they carry some very nice items. Whether you are looking for luggage, clothing, furniture, silverware, or household decorations, this store is likely to have something you'll like!

This place is pretty cool. We had never had Papa Murphy's before we moved down to Goodyear, so we decided to try it out. The staff is always super-friendly and helpful, and the prices here aren't bad. The staff always makes sure you know what to do with the take-and-bake pizza, just in case you've never had one before :)

We always have great experiences here. We used to come in to pick up the pizzas, and it was always kind of awkward (the staff was kind of awkward anyway, and the design inside is weird... tons of wasted space lol.) But other than that, no complaints. We usually just order for delivery now, and they are always on time or early, never late. Delivery people are hit or miss, sometimes very friendly or sometimes also awkward :P Or just silent... I like silent though, so that's not a negative haha.  The pizza is usually delicious, depending on how busy they are. If it's a busy night, I'm sure they're just rushing through pizzas and don't do as great of a job as they should. However, usually it seems like they do a great job because the pizzas are delicious. Their thin crust is great! We've tried most of their different kinds of specialty pizzas, although sometimes it's cheaper if you just make your own with the same ingredients as they list under their specialty orders. We especially love their BBQ sauce, which sounded kind of weird at first but actually tastes amazing on a pizza. Even just a regular Pepperoni pizza here tastes better than other places! Plus, it's "healthier," organinc, and all that... But you really can taste the difference in the quality of ingredients.  On that note, the prices are higher than other places. You get what you pay for though... but I must add that this place always has great deals going on. I think we only paid full price for a pizza once or twice. The rest of the time, we've been getting deals like 50% off, $10 larges with unlimited toppings, etc. You just have to watch out for the good deals! Once you factor those in, the prices are pretty great! However, paying full/regular price is ridiculous to me... they are pricey for what you get! (The large isn't all that huge, for example.)  Overall, quirky name and marketing system, quirky employees, delicious food, and often discounts. 4 stars for this place.

While this isn't a five star restaurant, my rating is still five stars -- for what this place is, it really does hit all the marks. My only complaint would be the location :)  I was actually expecting a sit-down restaurant with a server, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this was not the case. It is definitely more of a New York experience; customers walk in, order what they'd like at the counter, find any available seat, and enjoy their meal when it is brought out. Originally, we were in a bit of a hurry, so this was perfect! However, our plans changed as we were eating, so we were no longer in a rush and were able to enjoy our food for a bit longer.  The service was decent and definitely felt like "New York." While I'm not a native, I have been to New York a few times and loved it there. It was nice to have this experience all the way out in SURPRISE, Arizona! Inside was nothing spectacular, but it was clean and had some nice decorations. As others have mentioned, they have a big TV with a street cam view of Manhattan. I didn't pay too much attention to it, but it was kind of cool and added a bit to the escapism ;)  As for food--as I've just mentioned on my Bliss ReBAR review, I normally don't like French Toast... so I have no idea what's up with me and trying all the French Toast everywhere lately. However, when I see things like Pretzel Bread (Bliss) and Challah Bread (New York Flavor), I can't help but become interested. I LOVE Challah Bread, so when I saw the Challah French Toast, I had to get it. It did not let me down, either... and I'm glad it was all I got. It was very filling!!! I had three slices, but they were huge.  I also shared a slice with my husband in return for some of his cheesy scrambled eggs... His favorite scrambled egg recipe is to make it with crème fraîche, so we were stupidly excited when we realized that these cheesy eggs were made with crème fraîche!!! (By the way, we say crème fraîche like from the South Park episode every. time.)  It wasn't very busy, but we were there around 10am on a Saturday morning. I'm not sure if it gets busy at other times, but their menu did have some really delicious stuff on it for an all-day menu. If we're in the area again, we will definitely consider going here!

Everyone always says how amazing this place is across the country, so of course we had to try it out. The first one I went to was near Chicago, and it was okay. Then again, I don't really eat burgers (or fast food) all too often!  The Surprise location that just opened up, however, is not even comparable to the Chicago location we tried. My aunt really wanted to try it out, so we met her there during her lunch break and ordered some burgers and stuff. I don't remember it being that confusing to order before, but we were completely lost with all of the options/process and the people taking our orders were not very helpful. It was also extremely busy, but that was expected. However, some of the employees were extremely rude to other customers around us. They weren't rude to me personally, but I didn't like the way I saw a few of them speak to other customers. I thought I'd speak up for them, whether they realized it was happening or not! :P Some people are pretty oblivious, but employees shouldn't take advantage of that lol.  In my opinion, our orders were extremely simple. A few burgers and fries, nothing special about any of it. However, they took forever to get them out to us. The soda machines were pretty neat, but it was hectic trying to find the correct beverage with how busy the place was and the location of said soda machines. It was right in the way of the queue of people waiting for their orders, so it was also hard to tell who was waiting for what. It was also hard to hear which order numbers were being called, so I just stood right next to them waiting. I probably annoyed them, but oh well! Even then, I still could barely tell what order numbers they were calling out. I think they had a microphone to use, but they didn't seem to want to do that for some reason. (This is also one of the times I heard them being rude to other customers... this guy calling the numbers out called one customer's order two or three times, and the poor girls couldn't hear him. He finally got their attention and bitched at them for taking so long to get their order from him. I thought he was kidding with them at first, but the look on his face said otherwise.)  Overall, we weren't at all impressed with the price, the food (which was simply mediocre, nothing special), and service. Luckily I don't care about burgers because I'm not very American, but still... a disappointment for sure.

Well, as I've stated before, we are huge fans of Johnny Chu! We follow him around to every restaurant in the area that he opens, and we are never disappointed; Sochu House is no exception!  We have been here several times now and have enjoyed our experiences each time. The service, food, drinks, and environment are all consistently excellent. The prices are a little high, but we expect that. While it's not really a place for an everyday meal, it is nice for a special occasion or a night out! :) For example, we had a very nice time on Valentines Day earlier this year.  The servers are always excellent, friendly, helpful, and polite. They are also there only when you need them; otherwise, they know to give you your space. I adore this quality! I hate being pestered, but at the same time, I don't want to be ignored! :)   The food is incredible, but some of the portions are on the smaller side. Still, it is definitely quality and presentation over quantity. Nonetheless, we still leave with full bellies every time! My only complaint would be the dessert cream cheese wontons I got one time. It was a bit pricey and only came with two tiny wontons. The sauce was delicious, at least!   I also love the name in general... it is an awesome play on words with Johnny's family name and, I believe, the Japanese alcohol "Shochu." While the food is definitely a fusion, there are some Japanese elements in the dishes... especially presentation. Food should be beautiful AND delicious, and this is something that the Japanese and Johnny Chu have truly mastered. It is a perfect name for an excellent restaurant, and we will definitely be back sometime in the future.

Not too small, not too big, and a great community of staff, faculty, and students alike! It's a Maricopa Community College, so it has many similarities... same pricing and all that. Lots of outdoor seating and nice areas, plus some cool water features. If you can find them, there is a Koi Pond and a Turtle Pond near Ocotillo (unfortunately, most people use that area for smoking.) The Library is great, too. They have a restaurant for culinary students, but I've never been. Oh, and some of the buildings are pretty awesome. Mariposa, for example, is very "green" in design (very environmentally friendly inside and out) and even turns into a water feature when it rains here in the desert :) This is probably to mimic the waterfalls that occur in places like the White Tanks when it rains here.  Classes do fill up quickly, and there is no late enrollment. Some classrooms are small, others are nicely sized. Some have computers for every student, others do not have enough or any at all. As for the computers in the classrooms... lots of issues with them, but other students are likely the cause! Overall, such a great community college!

I'd have to say that I am definitely a fan of this place. Very small and kind of out of the way in the strip mall, but great nonetheless!   We got takeout here all the time after work. The food was always good every time, and they were always very friendly! We would generally just split an entree because they are so big, but they would still give us at least 2 fortune cookies and enough supplies for 2 people. (Many places we've ordered takeout from only give you one fortune cookie for one entree... not really a big deal since we don't even eat them, but I thought it was a nice touch here at AJK. It's the thought that counts! They are very thoughtful! :)  We recently decided to dine in for the first time, and we were just as satisfied as before. The food was the same quality as take out of course, but the service was phenomenal. It wasn't very busy at all, and everyone was extremely polite. We had Plum Wine and Oolong Tea, but quickly realized we needed some cold water with the hotness of our food! Both spicy and temperature... It was all very good though! Our favorite thing to get there is the cream cheese rangoons, and they are the best we've ever had! So delicious! I could eat tons of them for my entire meal, but I don't ;)  Some of the dishes we've ordered weren't so great here, but that's just personal preference. What we do like is excellently prepared, and we've never really been disappointed. The dinner for two thing we had when we dined in was a mistake... it was more like dinner for 3 or 4!!! Or maybe we're just not American enough. One entree and 1 or 2 appetizers would be enough... the dinner for 2 came with spring rolls, cream cheese rangoons, soup, a huge plate of rice, and 2 entrees. We had tons of leftovers, which was okay with us I guess! You definitely get your money's worth here though.  Oh, and the place is small, but very nice inside. Nice atmosphere... nothing spectacular, but it's comfortable and quiet. They also had 2 flat screen TVs that I saw, but I didn't really pay attention to what was on. Sports? idk.

OK, back when I was in middle/high school, I would come here occasionally and never really enjoyed my experiences. However, it was close to home and it was part of the mall, so why not? I believe the last time (before this past weekend) that I went here was when I was dragged to see Twilight with a bunch of friends. Wow, how it has changed since then!!!! It is completely different now!  You used to have to buy tickets outside in a separate booth, which was a bit awkward. However, now you walk inside (a definite plus when it is 110 degrees+ here!) and buy tickets there. We were all a bit thrown off since none of us have been here in a while, but we walked inside and went up to the counter anyway. We wanted to see Edge of Tomorrow which we had heard good things about, but it has been out in theaters for a while now. We were extremely shocked to find out that the showing was sold out--we definitely were not expecting that!  However, we decided to just do some shopping and come back for the next showing 2 hours later. Just in case, we bought our tickets right away. It was a little confusing because it told us to choose our seats; they have assigned seats now, I guess! It also didn't seem right, since there weren't very many options... I thought, "Maybe they are just sections?" We soon found out that this was not the case... the theater we were to see the film in simply had about 20 seats! Next, we thought, "Wow, it must be a tiny theater!"  We eventually got in to our theater at the end of the hall and discovered that it was indeed quite small, but it was not too bad. However, we were very pleasantly surprised to see massive, reclining, extremely comfortable chairs! Our section of 4 seats took up the space of at least 6 or more seats in a regular theater! We were definitely happy about this! :) So, yes, it was a little small, but it was definitely worth it since it was almost like a private showing for a decent price! Not that many showed up for this showing either-- I guess the earlier showing was full because the tickets were super cheap before 12pm.  Overall, it was a very pleasant experience. They even have those really cool soda machines with tons of choices! The best part is, you don't have to have the employees fill your drinks for you either. They also seemed to have healthier snack choices at the concessions stand too. Altogether, it was a much better experience than I've ever had in an AMC before, and it was definitely a massive improvement to what was there at Arrowhead before! :)
