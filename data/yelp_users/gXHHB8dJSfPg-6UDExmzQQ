It pains me to write this review because I have normally had great experiences with Cheba Hut, but today was just poor customer service. So for this specific review I will keep it to this specific experience.   It's April 20, which of course means this place would be busy. We called to place an order for pickup, only to have the phone hang up on us repeatedly. By the fifth phone call someone answered and quickly shouted, "Hey, good luck next time!"  Realizing we were being tossed to the side, I figured I would try one more time. This time someone else answered the phone and more kindly explained that they weren't taking orders over the phone or online due to the high volume. That's all well and good. However, if this is going to be the case, at least create an automatic voice message stating the fact if you know you're going to get inundated with phone calls. That would be far better than ignoring calls and rudely telling off potential customers.  Every other experience here has been great, but this one really irked us.

I've lived in the Valley for a little over 27 dog years, and I've yet to find a better dog park than this.   Why is that?  You've got a giant swimming pond, a diving peer, obstacles, plenty of running room, and a whole lot of other dogs.   My pooch has been enjoying this spot nearly our whole time as residents in the state of Arizona, and when I say, "Cosmo?" he perks his ears up and immediately looks toward where his leash hangs on the wall. He knows what's up, and if you have a dog in the East Valley, so should you.   While I'd love to give this place a 5-star rating, I just can't. That's not because of anything Cosmo does or doesn't do as a dog park specifically. Rather, it's because sometimes you'll run into dog owners who have no idea how or desire to learn how to maintain their dogs. It can be canine chaos at times due to the sheer number of pups, grizzled vets, and human children running amok. Occasionally you'll find someone who wants to sit on the sidelines and let their dogs run roughshod, leaving the yeoman's work of wrangling and corralling up to the other owners, without so much as even a hand from the actual owner or handler of the offending dogs.   That being said, this is a minor quibble, and the situation arises infrequently, while it's something you'd probably expect at any other dog park.    I have friends who live closer to downtown Phoenix where there are plenty of dog parks to enjoy, yet they still want to meet me out here in the suburb of Gilbert with their pooches to enjoy some Cosmo time.  That should tell you all you need to know.

*I've written a review for this place in the past, but that was about a year and a half ago, so I feel it's a good idea to revisit and revise.*  I've been frequenting The Coffee Shop for a year and a half now, at a rate of close to three times a week (sometimes more, sometimes less). Since becoming a regular, I've gotten to know the staff and their names, and they know exactly what I want every time I come in; although, that's pretty simple, as it's just a medium black coffee. Given that their drip system is a fairly standard one, you can expect the same brew every time. While I would love it if they went a bit more high-end in their regular coffee brewing, I can't complain too much. They source their beans from Mr. Espresso, which is based out of California. Would I prefer it to be something a little more local? Yes, especially given that most of their other ingredients for food is locally sourced; but again, this is a relatively minor quibble. If you choose to go the espresso route with a latte, cappuccino, etc., then you'll more than likely be satisfied. My guess is that most of the customers who frequent here wouldn't consider themselves to be coffee snobs, so I never really overhear much complaining on their part.   The Coffee Shop's ace in the hole, however, is their cupcakes. While I'm not a cupcake critic, I've never been anything less than pleased with what they have to offer. You'll find an assortment of unique and endearing choices, from Birthday Cake Cupcake to blueberry scones, and more. My personal favorite is the Red Velvet Cupcake, but I've also tried their signature item: Coffee & Cigarettes. While the name isn't the most appealing, it's what won them an episode of The Cupcake Wars, and I can see why.   Aside from sweets, they offer a pretty decent menu of healthy sandwhiches and wraps. However, if you can, go in the morning and grab something from their breakfast menu, such as The San Diegan. This open faced omelette will literally open your face with delight (whatever that means).   The only real drawback to The Coffee Shop can be summed up in the immortal words of Yogi Berra, "Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded." Given that it's situated on an idealic urban farm that tends to play home to the more hip and socially conscious crowd of Gilbert, you can expect to have to deal with long lines and relatively little seating due to the sheer number of humans. The inside decor and vibe is pretty open and rustic, as it's a converted tractor barn, complete with concrete walls, an open aired dining and seating area situated between two walls of near floor-to-ceiling windows, and a backroom filled with comfortable couches and chairs. The natural light poors in nicely, though it can create a bit of a glare at certain times of the day. Seating is available outside, but on hot summer days you'll probably have to fistfight someone for a spot indoors. Since it's also a coffee shop, you'll more than likely see idiots like me taking up a table for inordinate amounts of time while slowly sipping on their brew and typing away on their devices. That's just how it is, so be prepared and ready. Besides, if you're just getting a drink, you can always grab your beverage and take a nice walk through the beautiful urban farm area and enjoy nature a little. Your mom always says you need to get outside more.   In all, The Coffee Shop is one of the best destinations for food, coffee, and hanging out in the East Valley. Does it have its areas it could improve on? Of course; nearly every establishment does. However, there's a reason I come here most days to do my writing, so they're definitely doing something right.

The coffee is smooth and delicious, not to mention delicately brewed and roasted on site. The staff is always friendly eager to help you to make an informed decision about your drink, and I have yet to get a smug look from any of them when I feign ignorance about any drinks. That little test tells me an awful lot about an establishment, and it goes without saying that, while Cartel is a coffee connoisseur's delight, it works just as well for those who might not have a handle on the finer details of this art.   If there's anything to complain about this fine establishment, it's that there's always a crowd, lending it to being a less than ideal setting to sit and relax, due to a dearth in seating. But if you can find a spot to plop down, you're in perhaps the finest coffee establishment in all of Arizona. That's not an exaggeration.

I have typically only left a review if it was a superb experience or I wanted to give props to someone at an establishment. As it is, this is my first truly negative review, and it should confirm many of the other low-rated reviews you see here and elsewhere for this business.  I attempted to schedule an appointment with the owner via text, as his voicemail said that is the quickest way to get a response from him. I've attached the photo of our very brief conversation, complete with his business number so you know it's legitimate.   If you'll see, I actually found Jensen's Elite Detail through a Groupon that was being offered, and I tried to throw the guy a solid. I offered to just pay him directly for the Groupon amount--as opposed to going through Groupon--so he could keep at least the whole (discounted) amount. Had I gone through Groupon he would have actually only received a QUARTER of what a full service payment would have been, because Groupon takes half of the deal AFTER the discount. It's something I do with almost every business, and I've never had one pass me up on it.  More than 24 hours later and I don't even get a courtesy response. Usually this wouldn't bother me too much, but if you read the reviews here you'll see that so many people ran into similar issues, or at least experienced terrible customer service with a smarmy attitude. I expressed that displeasure to the owner, and his response was like that of a scorned former high school significant other.   Don't waste your money here, because the owner obviously doesn't value his work or your patronage.

We come here every once in awhile for the smoothies, which are typically quite excellent. However, today we tried the "limited time only" Luau Sliders, and we wish we hadn't.   We got the Caribbean Jerk Chicken and two Sweet Sriracha Chickens. They were obviously microwaved, as they came out a good four minutes before our smoothies were even finished, and no other orders were being made. They were 90% bun, with what looked like old, frozen white chicken. You know, the kind you had in your elementary school cafeteria. It's not like we were expecting a gourmet slider by any means, but they were certainly disappointing.   Were it not for the typically great smoothies we get here, I would have left one star. That being said, even the Blueberry Bliss I got today was subpar, tasting almost entirely like a banana. I get banana is one of the ingredients, but the namesake should at least be the overarching flavor.
