I've been coming here for a long time. The atmostphere is cool. The magazine selection is fantastic. The place has gone downhill a little bit. The stylists used be peppy efficient friendly decent people. Now they all seem to be extremely slow, I mean a haircut every 30 min max. How the hell do you make money doing two $21 haircuts per hour?! The quality of empoyees has also begun to dwindle, kind shabby looking if you know what I mean (the supercuts variety). I don't really know where else to get my hair cut, I really like that they shave your neck with the razor. I tried to contact the owner who I've met and is really fast by the way), but there isn't a website.

Excellent, fast, inexpensive. Plain old good Mexican Food. I would drive across town for it, but if you live in the vicinity it's a must have.

I've been coming here for over 6 years. First as single dude, then with my future wife and now with my kids (much less often). The bar is great, latin nights can get crazy and the food is really  good. If you're coming for food, come a little early. If you're coming for late night, it's loud and packed (and really fun). I highly recommend this joint over your usual Mexican fare.

This is my number one Mexican choice. You have to like spicy food. If you don;t you will hate it and probably write an inappropriately bad review. Carne adovada ribs and shrimp vera cruz are the only two choices in my opinion. If you get something else, it's at your own risk of wishing you had ordered one of these two items. I always order the beer on draft, unless it's a night for some margaritas which will knock you out (a little expensive, but really strong). The downtown location is my favorite, followed by the Mesa joint. Downtown has the best scenery but you have to wait a long ass time. I love this place.

We actually just stopped in here for desert after pasta bar. We really wished we had come for dinner. The menu looked great. We had the tiramasu and chocolate cake, both were killer. The owner, Joe, was great and the bartender was really helpful. We'll definitely be coming back here for dinner.

I've been going here since high school. This is the standard by which I compare all new york style pizza. This pizza is goooooooood! I rarely order a whole pizza but come here during the lunch special (11-2:30, I believe). It's hella cheap too. Everypne, I mean everyone I have try this pizza loves it. I always bring one of these babies to superbowl parties, big basketball games, etc. Ya gotta try it!

My wife and kids have been coming here since they opened. It's a perfect place for a quick good breakfast. Walk up and order, no waitress to wait on. It's really the exact same experience as PeiWei. It is a little more difficult to maneuver on busy  days.   Overall it's clean, good and fast. When you have little kids these are the only things you care about!

I love this place. The service is usually fast. The pizza tastes so damn good and the atmosphere is fantastic. The drinks are always good with a full bar and the patio is really nice (never had a belligerent smoker to deal with). The prices aren't going to compete with your local pizza parlor (see Raffael's), but you don't feel bad about paying for your food. Definitely check this place out if you haven't been. You won't regret it.

I called Empire plumbing at 230 am on a Wednesday. I expected to here a groggy 70 year old man on the other end, but was surprised that the operator was very friendly and not the least bit annoyed by my call. He arrived 20 minutes later .  The fix didn't require any new parts and I was only charged the service fee of about $70. This was the best experience in the situation I could imagine. If you need emergency (or any) work on your AC, call these guys right away!

Old school barber shop. Tony does a great job and makes great conversation. Definitely recommend.
