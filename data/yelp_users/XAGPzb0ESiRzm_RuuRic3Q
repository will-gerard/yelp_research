I came in on thursday to do some light reading. I had my phone charger plugged in to the wall and was seated at a table. I hadn't got a drink because I already had to much caffeine . Well one of the baristas came over asked if I wanted anything and I said no thank you. Couple mins later the barista says to me " Yeah your sitting at my table, using our electricity, you have to purchase a drink to do so"  now i thought he was joking with me and really he wasn't. I got a shot of espresso and kindly walked my self outta there. Now i get it, but never in my life have i been treated like that. Iv worked for Starbucks well over 4 years (left in 2013) and we would never say something like that to any customer due to the fact that I'm sure everyone has given plenty of there money to the company. i will gladly be never giving my business to coffee rush again

Had the best experience here within a doctors office these past 6 months!! This was finally the first doctor office were i felt herd and comforted. I usually see Dr. Yaten patel but when i made the appt he was all booked so got scheduled with Jennifer Spohn. She was phenomenal! Very friendly and reminded me of my aunt in this field.  I recommend her if dr patel is all booked. Thank you so much for helping me figure out whats wrong with my health!

I came into the bank around 330, I was kinda in a rush and I didn't have an account with them I just needed to cash my work check. The guy up front was very nice and I explained I didn't want a checking account because I didn't think id qualify. He talked me Into trying and a lady named Stacey helped me big time!! Turns out I could qualify and she also gave me advice for other financial troubles. Im happy they talked me into it. I recommend her if your wanting an acct . It only took 10 minutes to open too!!

I started seeing goodman and partridge a couple years back. I remember it being very comfortable and the staff was very nice. Now this time i had to see them again due to ovarian cysts. I had my results and films from my ultrasound and went to give it to them and they stated they didnt really need it. i found it odd because how would they know how to treat me? The PA assistant stated that since i have no history with them that i had to wait awhile to see what was going on. I had to schedule out another ultrasound a month in advance. The day before my scheduled ultrasound i was contacted stating the doctor was oncall and had to change my appt. Well that night i had experienced the worst internal stomach pain. I knew my cysts were popping or something serious was going on. So when i went to my appt she did my ultrasound in 2 minutes and then i saw the dr who couldnt really understand me ( language barrier) and i had my boyfriend with me because i wasnt really cohereint due to my episode the night before. They just kept saying it was because i was backed up, but i know that wasnt the case. I wasnt told about my cysts she just said it looks like there was never anything there. Im just upset because im still having the pain . So i scheduled for a gasterologist hoping they will find whats wrong. This place is misleading and i will be finding another obgyn.   **update: i had called back this afternoon to ask for my results because i wasnt convinced. i could feel something is wrong with me. I was then told i have pelvic inflammatory disease, and she hung up. I then googled it and freaked myself out so i called right back and all of the sudden they were closed. So i had to call after hours nurse who i was told would have access to my chart. She didnt and did however educate me. She said it is caused by an STD,douching, or a uid. I know for a fact i have never had a uid,iv never douched, so she said it must be an std. Iv had the same sex partner ( my boyfriend) for 7 months. Nobody could tell me anything. So in a final attempt it was 7 pm ( there open til 8pm ) i called the front desk and asked if they had access to my chart. They did but unfortunatley nobody there has a medical background and cant read it. All i wanted to know was if in fact my culture had anything on it. She was noting and typing in the notes everything i had told her because apparently everyone else i talked to didnt note i called. I will never be going back to this office and will demand my results in the morning . BEWARE DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!

If i could i would give no stars. I noticed on my medication account online through my insurance that there was a medication that was filled here i wasnt aware of. I contacted my insurance and was told they mixed me up with my twin sister and filled an antibiotic under my name. I find this very un-ethical, and completely screwed up that they didnt check the name and notice it wasnt me picking this up. Not only am i now worried about my identity, but now worried about my overall medications. What if i needed this medication and was told i already filled it prior? THIS IS WHY COSTCO PHARMACY IS WAY BETTER THAN CVS. So since CVS screwed up on there part i now have to go down there monday and make sure they take this off and put it under my sisters insurance. Might i add me and my sister have different health insurances. I will never go back to this company for anything again.
