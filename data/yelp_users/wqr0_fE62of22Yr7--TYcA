No wait or cars ahead of me and they still took forever. Over 45 mins for an oil change and an air filter change. I should've done it myself..... Horrible.

Love shopping here. They a great variety of stores and restaurants. The atmosphere is great, along with everyone who is shopping there. Every store and restaurant I've visited so far has really a friendly staff. Check it out for yourself and enjoy the relaxing atmosphere!

This place is great! Love their smoothies, there all natural and super fresh!    I truly find the boost shots helpful, specially for 25 cents.   A bit on the pricey side but you get what you pay for lol I just wish it was cheaper so I could do this everyday

Poor customer service and the gym is decent. I was set up and wasn't even given a breakdown on the charges or given a tour of the place... Horrible.

Poor customer service and the gym is decent. I just moved into the Phoenix/mesa area, I was set up and wasn't even given a breakdown on the charges or given a tour of the place... The guy was pretty vague... Think he was the manager too, Horrible.

This is a restaurant which offers a variety of Mexican  street foods and snacks. This is a really clean restaurant and the staff is very friendly. They sell sandwiches, flautas, tortas, salads, and even have ice cream. The food is tasty however if you get a Torta make sure to ask for it on fresh instead of it being fried(makes it soggy) check out this place

Great tasting food!!!! Best tacos I've have had in the Phoenix area!!! I recently moved here from a border city and this is as close as it gets to traditional Mexican food. They have fresh food, great tasting salsas and a very friendly staff! Open 24 hours on the weekends

Love this place, the food is great. Love the fact that guacamole is actually free. Fresh food all the time, no long waits like chipotle!   Make sure to give the Chile con Queso a try!!!! It's amazing! (Mexican style nacho cheese)

Great spot for anyone looking to learn about firearms  or who is already a firearm enthusiast. Went over to C2 to check out prices and learn more about personal protection firearms  but the staff actually gave me a full break down on entry level firearms and the services which they offer. Definitely recommend it to anyone in the Tempe/Chandler area.  They have an indoor shooting range and offer firearms rentals
