Adopted a wonderful dog from this shelter. They genuinely seemed interested in matching people to compatible dogs rather than just pushing pets out the door.  Kennels were uniformly clean, dogs looked reasonably happy, and the staff was incredibly helpful.  We spent at least an hour meeting various dogs in one of several fenced play area.  The staffer who helped us seemed very knowledge about each dog and didn't seem the least bit put off that we were being picky about our "forever pet."   I also like their adoption policies.  They provide a free vet visit, a month of free health care through ShelterCare, and request that they have a chance to take a pet back should you decide you can't care for them anymore.  The fees were reasonable (age dependent.  Puppies cost more than adults and older animals under $50) and their post-adoption behavior helpline returned my call within 24 hours.  In short, these guys deserve your money and their doggies are damn cute.  They might not be as slick as the AZ humane societies palatial estate but they seem to be getting the job done and done well.  Oh yeah, they should get a sixth star for constantly updating their online gallery of adoptable pets as well as taking the time and effort to take attractive pictures of these animals.  I hate how so many shelters put up these blurry bigfoot-style photos and expect people to say "OH honey look! Isn't that the cutest brown smudge you've ever seen?" Clearly the staff here has put some serious thought into presentation.   Further, they actually spend time playing and training their animals, all in an effort to make sure that each animal is able to put its best paw forward if you will.  For cat lovers:  Their cat.. house?  Is one of the best setups I've seen.  Cats are kept in separate rooms but are allowed to roam freely, including an enclosed outside areas. Rather than stare at a bunch of cats through a glass window you can go into these rooms, pet cats to your hearts content and really interact with them before making your selection.  If I was in a market for a cat I'd definitely come here.  You get a real feel for how these cats would react in a regular home and it certainly seems like a nicer way to house cats.  Note: For those of you medically minded folk out there.  The cat house does seem like a recipe for disaster but they a separate staff-only sickbay for cats that need to be isolated from the general population for health or behavior reasons.  Cats that are still adjusting to shelter life are kept in cages as well.  I've visited this shelter four or five times and I've yet to see anything resembling a fight so the staff definitely takes precautions when choosing which cats can become "free range."

So it's been almost three months since we adopted Tiberius, our 15lbs mystery dog, and we really couldn't be happier. I have to say that the staffers at AAWL really did right by us and helped us select the dog that is almost perfectly matched with our ability to care for him. Tiberius is high energy enough to be fun while not so bounce-off-the-walls crazy that he destroys our house.   Thanks AAWL! And whoever abandoned this pup is certainly missing out.

A little slice of the Pacific Rim, caught under the broiling heat of the Arizona sun.  It's exactly as Island should be: Fast, fatty, surrounded by rice, and served in a styrofoam container with a side of macaroni salad.  This is food that you should be eating on a beach after spending a morning playing in the ocean.  I had to settle on eating it on my patio after working in my garden but the food tasted just as good.  I rated it 5 stars, this is definitely food that deserves to be eaten.  But make no bones about it, if you hate island food, food from Korea, or macaroni salad.... this probably isn't going to change your mind.  It's comfort food for people who think flip-flops should be year round footwear.

Competent udon and ramen noodles but the sushi was lacking.  3 star food at 4 star prices=2 star restaurant. It's... okay and that's it.

Liberty Market has slowly risen to be my go-to "fancy" eatery in the Valley. The food is fantastic and the price is just low enough that my broke college ass can afford to go there from time to time. This is usually a breakfast place for us but that's mostly due to our schedules. I for one love their weekend dinner specials because... they're almost always fantastic.   Other positives:  -Dog friendly. You cannot bring your pup inside with you to order but you can certainly sit outside and nosh with pup in tow.  -Bread pudding. It's always good but most of the time it's fantastic. Fresh whipped cream and cinnamon rolls that have found a new life as custard.  Negatives: -Somewhat limited menu. This doesn't really count against them because I'd rather eat at a place that serves 3 things well (See: In-N-Out) than a place that serves a thousand things poorly (See: Denny's)

Let's be clear, I like what the AZ Humane Society does and I think their Campus for Compassion is a mind boggling awesome facility.  My only problem is that out of the three times we've gone to visit they were... out of dogs.  It's entirely possible we have poor timing or that their adoption program is so fantastic that the dogs fly out of their kennels but... it was still rather strange and I couldn't help but wonder if their kennels are being under utilized.    But that's all just idle speculation and perhaps a plea for them to get more good dogs out of the county shelters and into the air conditioned, classical music playing comfort of their Campus for Compassion.  I have no doubt that once a dog gets into one of these places he is well cared for.  One thing I particularly liked about their design was that there was a low wall separating the two rows of kennels in each building.  I think that seems like a fantastic idea for lowering the animals stress as they don't have to stare across the hallway at some pissed off dachshund all day.  It also means that getting dogs too and from their kennels isn't as big as a deal because there is only one row of barking dogs they have to worry about.  And yes, it's probably the nicest shelter I've ever heard about.

Do you like street tacos?  I do and I feel I have pretty high standards, all of which were exceeded by this place.   I got the combination plate (meat, rice, beans, tortillas) for just under 7 dollars. They even through in some deep fried jalapenos. That plate destroyed me in all the right ways. I ate about half of it and was completely stuffed. I got the pork BBQ and the carne asada and was pleasantly surprised by both quantity and quality.   I'll be back.

Really a very nice local park with plenty of room for dogs to run. People tend to look after their dogs and I haven't come across and truly awful owners or out of control dogs.   It might not be as sexy as Cosmo but it certainly gets the job done. As with all dog parks you should probably choose a time to take your dog wisely. Weekends, after 4 PM, etc tend to be very busy and the likelihood you'll run into a dog or owner you can't stand will rise.  I recommend hitting the park before lunch or on the weekdays .  Oh, and did I mention this park has plenty of trees? Probably the edge that this park has over any other (including Cosmo) is that someone had the foresight to plant some trees. Having a cool shady place to hang out while your dog takes a break from chasing other dogs is a welcome addition.

Executive Summary: -Incredible selection of RPGs (WOTC, CGL, Travelers, MANY indie companies)  -Good selection of board games -Warhammer et al dominates half the store -Owner is professional and personable. Pretty much the exact opposite of your typical Gaming/Comic store owner.  -Dog friendly! -Easily the best gaming store I've been to in Phoenix -10% Military Discount   Narrative: I called all around Phoenix looking for "Eclipse Phase," the RPG lovechild of Alastair Reynolds  and Richard K. Morgan, nobody had it and a few places hadn't heard of it.  When I called Imperial Outpost Games I was cordially greeted and assured that at least one copy remained. On a whim I asked if I could bring my dog and was amused and shocked to find out that this wouldn't be a problem.  An excessively long drive later (I live in Chandler, the store is in Glendale) I pulled up to shop and headed inside. I was warmly received and my book was waiting for my at the register (I hadn't requested this or even given my name so I was very pleased to see someone had thought this through).  After dropping money on a fine bit of sci-fi RPG writing I wandered around the store and was pleasantly surprised to see it well EXTREMELY well stocked (All the big names and at least one whole section for indie games) and equally split between Warhammer and RPGs/boardgames.   Everyone seemed friendly and the owner (Darren) obviously knows how to run his shop. He clearly wants my money and is willing to make it worth my while to give it to him, rather than buying off Amazon.  On a side note: Unlike another store I visited a couple months ago... this one kept it's political inclinations to itself and I have to say that I found that refreshing and welcoming.

$60+Tip for some of the most mediocre Indian food I have ever put in my face.  I was initially going to give this place a two star rating but the longer I thought about it (and the better, cheaper food I had elsewhere: six bucks at Mike's Big Breakfast comes to mind as does the $20 we spent at Joe's Farm Grill) the more pissed off I became. At Joe's Farm Grill we ate food that provided about triple the amount of pleasure for a third of the cost and we got to do it in a very pretty part of Chandler.   Sheetal R. Already gave an excellent rundown of what we ate and what was good and what meh so I won't repeat that here.   The food here is not terrible but the cost is so disproportionate to the quality of the food that I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone. $60 for two people should buy you FANTASTIC food not barely mediocre food.

Damn good pho and I was incredibly spoiled in Seattle so... yeah.  So far my favorite pho place in all of Phoenix.

Holy crap, free paella.  Not so much a farmers market as farm that sells stuff on the front lawn, Singh Farms is awesome.  Recommended to me at another farmers market, my fiance and I journeyed to Scottsdale on a rainy day to purchase some compost and maybe some vegetables.  We got the compost (good stuff, only 12 bucks for a bag you could hide a body in)  and suddenly realized..  Holy crap, free paella.    Evidently various groups come out to guest cook for lunch and we were treated to some spicy and delicious food cooked in a giant wood fired oven.     Highly recommend this place, the guy is personable and informative.  The only reason I took off a star is because they don't allow dogs.  Evidently the owner got yelled about by county health for dogs mixing with food bu still kinda lame.

Olives, fondue, pretzels, prime rib sliders, bruschetta, sangria. It all tasted like delicious.

Capsule Review:  Tammy and her husband deserve your money.  Tammy knows her way around dogs and they both seem to know how to run a business properly.  Calls and emails are returned properly, people show up on time, and there's no question that you are getting what you're paying for. We saw results with our dog immediately and Tammy did a fantastic job ensuring that we could replicate what she was showing us.  It also doesn't hurt that both her and her husband are painfully affable people who seem to have a genuine love of dogs.    The Long Answer: We recently adopted a dog and were looking to get into a training program for him.  For whatever reason we couldn't find a class that was opening in a timely fashion.  Disheartened we headed out to Tempe Feed & Tack (an excellent store in it's own right).  While browsing amongst the stacks of excellent dog food we unloaded our tale of woe upon the owners who promptly handed us business card to this couple.  Wiggles and Wags got back to us within 24 hours via email and were incredible helpful in assisting us in selecting the right training program for our dog.  Given our schedule, and the nature of the things we wanted to work on (destructive separation anxiety, aggression vs. dogs while on leash) we decided that a private 1 on 1 session was most appropriate for our dog and we had an appointment for later that week.    Sixth Star: They also help out local shelters with training programs, both for dogs that have been brought in and for people who have recently adopted.  Good karma for them.

Holy meh... Absolutely forgettable broth, overdone and too thickly cut beef.   Really the broth offended me the most, it didn't taste bad but the flavor just wasn't all there. It almost tasted watered down.  Just mehhh... better places too be had. Pricey too, ban mih shouldn't cost more than $3.50 unless it's made with angel tears.   Service was exceptionally slow for a pho joint but the portions were of a good size. Mind you, a huge bowl of spectacularly average pho isn't exactly a positive thing in my book.
