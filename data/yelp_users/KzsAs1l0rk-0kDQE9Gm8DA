I'm shocked by all the good reviews that I have seen for Diego Pops.  My first visit did not meet what others have experienced.  I visited this place on a beautiful Sunday afternoon and I have to say the patio bar is awesome....  The food and drinks however, are not!  Weak drinks, soup came out cold, tacos were average and service at the bar was poor.  Definitely would not go back to this place.
