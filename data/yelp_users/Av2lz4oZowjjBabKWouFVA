This Golds is much bigger than the one in Tukee, and nicer too. The employees up front are always nice, there is plenty of equipment to use. They even have a special workout area for women here so girls don't have to feel creeped out by dudes checking them out, which I know is a big complaint for most women at gyms. I want to give it 5 stars, but the gym is really busy at the start of the week, and most weekdays it can be a little difficult to find a parking space, but that's not exactly something Golds could improve upon but worth mentioning. For $15/mo you can't lose.

A few years ago I bought my wife's ring here. I must have spent hours looking at different diamonds, never did my jeweler lose patience with me or her excitement in her job. I take the rings in every 6 months for examination and cleaning. I am always promptly greeted, even when they are packed, and they have always resolved our issues and stood behind their warranty.   I would ignore the 1 star reviews, IMO these people seem stuck up with other worldly expectations, they seem to be poor communicators, or just love to project their own negativity. (Don't be a pretentious snob, and if you have an issue communicate it, if you don't like the response, communicate that to a manager.) DUH!  Go ahead and go to a few different jewelers before or after Shane Co., I'm pretty sure you'll find they are the best to work with and the only company that offers a truly free lifetime warranty.   (I have no affiliation with Shane Co., other than being a very pleased and lifetime customer).

San Tan Brewing Company is awesome. Come for the beer and stay for the food my friends. My wife and I like to come here for the Sunday Brunch. They have unique food items too. The Hefeweizen is my favorite. Seasonal brews of Mr. Pineapple and Sex Panther are awesome too! The macaroni dish is amazing, so are the burgers. This place can get a little bit crowded for dinner on the weekends, but so glad this is in my backyard. Try it.

I sent my now wife to this place as a secret to get her out of the house to make extra preparations on the night I was going to pop the question. The receptionist at the time was not personable and she sat there 20mins past her appointment time and was being ignored so she left and almost caught me making plans. Luckily the day and night still worked out, but no thanks to these folks.

Howard and Treewise are awesome. Had them do three mexican palms, one of which had been badly neglected. Pricing is great and the work is exceptional. I trimmed two small trees a few days before they came and hadn't picked up all the mess since my trash was full. Treewise practically picked up every scrap in my whole back and front yard as well as picked up my junk, which was not expected at all. Wow, is all I can say, great guy and great company.
