I had the Union Jack omelette, I was worried at first that it might be smothered with cheese but It actually came out quite nice.  The only down side to this place was the seating. We got placed in this corner sweet next to a plant that blocked a lot of the view we had.

Grabbed a Sicilian slice and regular cheese slice. Sicilian wasn't the best the dough seemed a bit off. The regular slice was awesome. Garlic knots were loaded with garlic but really delicious. Nothing beats a slice from a whole pizza fresh out of the oven though.

San Tan Brewery is so goooooood. The fish and chips were ok but the street tacos are where it's at. If and when you go that's what you need to get. The giant pretzels and that cheese sauce are super amazingly good so get that too on top of that delicious epicenter Amber

The cleanest and best layout for a whole foods I have seen. I haven't met a single rude employee and they are extremely helpful with whatever questions you have. Great place to try local beers and the grill inside cranks out some great food.

This was a really awesome ramen noodle restaurant. I wasn't expecting such a huge bowl! The chili pepper ramen was super good and spicy. I also had a side of the shrimp tempura which was also very tasty. I would recommend picking that up with your ramen bowl.

Yooooooooolis! We love this place. There hasn't been one single thing on the menu that hasn't been good. Chorizo burrito and the volcano style biscuits were super delicious. The owners are super friendly and are always coming around saying hi and checking on things.

I love this location. The atmosphere is great and the staff is wonderful. While I'm not a huge fan of their pizzas as I'm a New York pizza type of person, the pasta and garlic bread is great. I recommend trying the penne bake and the bowlo pasta. Add meatballs to whatever you can because they are very delicious as well!

I love the goat burger and the sweet potato fries. The waiter is always super nice and cracks jokes, makes for a great atmosphere.

The buffet was lack luster. There was no Chana masala and when we did order it, it was 9 bucks and only a cups worth. The service was very poor and didn't refill our water even though there were only two other people. I would not recommend going here at all.

Heather does an awesome job cutting my hair. All of her products are great to use. Her studio is very professional and her assistant Melissa is awesome!

I had really high hopes for this place. The service was super slow and took quite a while to get our food and it wasn't that busy.   I had the carne asada, Baja and crispy fish taco. The crispy fish taco was actually pretty good, but the other two just didn't taste good at all. They pretty much lacked flavor and had no substance. The tortilla was also pretty bland. I can't really recommend coming here if your a big taco fan.

Decided to try this place as I have driven by it tons of times. Tried ordering the food online as they have that option on their website. Unfortunately it failed twice and when I called it in they said it hasn't been working since they opened. We had the cinco burger and the Texas haystack. The burgers were great and cooked the way we wanted them. The veggies on the burger were fresh and spicy. We also got the ale fries which were so so. The place is still pretty new but very clean.
