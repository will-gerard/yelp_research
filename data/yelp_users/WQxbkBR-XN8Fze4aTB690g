Like everyone said, this store has attentive staff who takes the time to fit your feet with the right shoe. They looked moderately busy when we walked in, but a man greeted us and asked us to be patient. Someone got to us within a couple of minutes and helped both my friend and me at the same time. The entire process was maybe 20 minutes. He gave us great advice about starting to run, too. We then waited a couple minutes at the counter to be run up, but it seemed like they were busier than usual, so it wasn't a huge annoyance.  Don't walk in thinking you'll be looking at stylish Nikes or anything, but you will get great service and shoes that are properly priced.

I really don't know how this place has such great reviews. I walked in on Friday night to order takeout. I waited at the bar/counter area for about 10 minutes with maybe 5 other people all waiting to order take out or pick up. It seemed very chaotic for the one woman behind the counter taking orders, fetching them, and ringing them out. It looked like she was even serving on the floor at times. The food took about 20-25 minutes once my order was placed. Prices were okay, but the food wasn't anything to write home about. I got Hot & Sour Soup (nice and spicy) and Mongolian Beef (a weird light brown color...).  As for ambiance, it definitely has that feel of chinese restaurants from the 90's.

Easy location, really helpful employees, and everywhere I looked was fully stocked. My only complaint is that the store is small and has so much product. Customers tend to "hog" an area so you can barely get by or grab what you want. It's strange! The woman ringing me out was really cool, I asked her what kind of bleach she recommended and instead of what I had brought up, she found me a cheaper and better solution!

I woke up in the middle of the night having trouble breathing, which was made worse by the fact that I had just run out of my asthma inhaler. I debated whether I should wait until an urgent care opened or just go to the ER, and finally I decided to just go. I'm so glad I did. I was in and out in less than an hour-- unbelievable. The intake nurses were so calm and sweet and very respectful. I was seen literally immediately. The nurses told me there had been a 5 hour wait all night so I really lucked out. Several nurses came in and out while I was in a room, and each asked me if I was comfortable or would like to watch tv. The doctor spoke about 3 sentences to me but I can imagine they were busy with patients who had more significant issues than mine. I would definitely recommend this ER if you live close by. I am back in my bed in less than an hour and a half!

The pharmacy is 24 hours and generally always busy. I haven't had the best experiences there, but whenever I go it looks like they're understaffed by at least 1-2 people. The last time I was there, the girl behind the counter told me she "doesn't usually work back here." Oh... comforting. Unfortunately I do have to keep coming back because it's so close to my apartment. Dammit.

If you're looking for a classic diner experience, then this is it. The atmosphere is bustling and fun, and the restaurant is jam packed with patrons of all ages. The menu is pretty huge, but once you order, the food is out in a flash.  The patio is very dog friendly, and they bring out water bowls for the pooch as soon as you sit down, which is much appreciated.  FYI -- Cash/check only, but there's an ATM inside.

I took my 10 week old puppy, Stevie, in for his first check up just one day after picking him up. He was mostly fine with just a yeast infection in his ears, but I was a wreck with anxiety as the reality of raising my first dog had just set in. Everyone from the receptionist to the doctor were kind, patient, and helpful. We've gone back a few more times and feel super comfortable with how we are treated.  A few weeks ago, Stevie had a cherry eye pop up. We called, not knowing what it was, and they asked us to come right in with no appointment needed. After that experience, I believe they accept animals based on urgency and priority, and not strictly on appointment time. For me, that makes the 20-30 minute wait way more comfortable for me (as there is occasionally a wait before being seen.) ***I edited this review on 2/26/16 as the last two visits, we've been waiting 30-60 minutes after our appointment time. To clarify, we have requested the last appointment of the day, which probably plays a factor in the delay.***   I also love that none of the vets have felt pushy in the way that I care for my dog. They don't "strongly recommend" a specific brand of food nor the right age for neutering. I've seen some vets that make me feel like I'm raising my dog all wrong, and I don't get that vibe at Saguaro.  If I'm ever concerned about my pup after an appointment, I can call and get the doctor on the phone within a few hours. I've also left a message on a weekend evening and received a call first thing the following morning. It's great!  Definitely a fan of Saguaro Vet Clinic!

This is about 2 steps up from IHOP. If you're looking for a quick breakfast place to hit outside of the typical weekend brunch hours, it could suffice, but definitely do not stick around if there's a wait.

Been living here about 10 months and I absolutely love it. It's within walking distance to shopping, restaurants, Safeway, and Walgreens. Smack dab in between the 51 and 101, and lots of other amenities within a few minutes driving distance.  Other than the high turnover of the staff in the leasing office (my two favorite employees mysteriously disappeared...), they call you back promptly, have pest exterminators that come every Tuesday should you need some spraying, and the maintenance people are very speedy. After months of being lazy, I finally called to mention the water temperature being inconsistent. I got home from work that day and saw they had replaced my entire water heater!   The only complaint I have is that my particular set of neighbors strictly abide by the quiet hours rule, 10pm-7am. They don't care for the noise when I have a couple girlfriends over past 10pm, and have twice called security on me. When security comes to your door, regardless of confirming or denying that there's even a noise problem, they must report you to the mgmt. office who the next day leaves you a note in your door, scolding you on your behavior and providing a written warning that will permanently reside in your "file." It seems unfair-- taking someone else's word for it without proof from either security or the tenant who was reported! They could try telling this pesky old man that he lives in an apartment building and if he doesn't want noise, he can go back to his enormous house in Canada or wherever he lives 6 months out of the year.  Anyway, great price, great location, but beware of the snowbirds who go to bed at 8pm!

Time for an update.  What I failed to mention the last time is that out of the five or so times I've called the office to request maintenance, about 4 times they haven't answered (and it was during business hours). They have an emergency maintenance line, so I called that. They "log" my issue and they claim the maintenance person will call me shortly after. That has NEVER happened that way.  About 3 times I've waited HOURS and had to call the office multiple times AND the emergency line to re-submit my issue. The emergency line says they'll contact the office AGAIN, the office says they never got the complaint, and then the office provides some excuse hours later when I still haven't heard anything, i.e.; "We're very busy fixing OTHER people's air conditioners, you'll just have to wait even longer." They seriously lack customer service.  The maintenance man, I think his name is Juan, is the nicest of all the employees. It's clear he's the hardest worker of anyone I've interacted with, and the poor guy works on multiple properties. Maybe things would get done faster if they had less people in the office and more helping with maintenance...?  A month ago, I called before they opened on a Tuesday morning to ask that they spray my apartment for little black bugs that show up in the summertime. I left a message. The exterminators come to the complex every Tuesday and spray the apartments that need it. I check my messages on Wednesday and listen to one saying they'll add me to the list NEXT Tuesday. WTF?! That's why I called Tuesday morning! I call back and speak to a woman who argues with me saying I never left a message and SHE'S the one who listened to the messages on Tuesday. F*** off, lady, I didn't leave a message? So how did the dude in the office know to call me back and add me to the list in the first place? She even had the audacity to tell me they'd charge me to have the exterminator return that day. I pushed harder and pointed out that subtle fact about the message and she finally agreed to cover the extermination charge. But should I really have to argue for that? Ugh.  Most recent headache was today. I called at 1pm to report my disposal wasn't working. The office didn't pick up (not surprised), the emergency line took my info quickly and said the maintenance person would call me back shortly. No call. I didn't get out of work until the office was long closed, and no one has called nor fixed the problem.  There is terrible communication between maintenance, the office, and the tenants. Lots of things are great at this complex, I'm considering moving again just because I hate paying for a luxury community and being treated like I don't know what they're doing. Either this team knowingly has bad customer service/communication and doesn't care to fix it, or their management doesn't know what's been going on.  Hey Lincoln Properties, which is it?

The younger girl behind the counter was really friendly despite my indecision about my order. Finally I decided on a garlic bialy with a side of whitefish salad and a soda. It was like... $11 for the total. The small scoop of whitefish salad was $5.95 or something crazy. The bialy and the whitefish were great despite the price.

Fantastic sashimi, great service, and pretty decently priced for the quality and quantity. It doesn't bring the ritziness or glamour like Ra or Stingray in terms of fancy rolls, environment, or location, but it's definitely one of the best sushi places I've found in Phoenix!

I friggin love this place. It has such a family feel, and you always see the same staff (a couple, I think they must be the owners) every weekend. They definitely don't let you take your time as you order before you pay, but you get your food very quickly and they bring it right over to your table. The bagels are delicious and the smoked salmon bagel (The Works) is enough for two-- just get an additional bagel with cream cheese and you're good!

I work in the mall, so I'm in here quite a bit. The employees are always friendly, do their best to remember me by name, and go above and beyond like I've heard Starbucks does (yet never actually seen until this location.) I've tried to pay with a gift card and was short a buck or two, but they gave me my scone anyway and just said "no problem." I've spilled an entire drink all over the counter and before it was even cleaned up, there was a new drink waiting for me. Most recently, I tried one of the Cool Lime Refreshers, and the woman making the drink said, "Is this your first time trying it? Before you head out, try it and if you don't like it, I can make something else for you." How cool is that?  They make the drinks at lightning speed and I've never asked to have one remade, so I'm pretty happy with this location.

After giving them a 5 star review, boy, did another sales lady set me straight. I have always been annoyed that none of their stores can look up previous purchases or receipts, so as a result, I've been good about keeping all of them. If you bring back an item without the receipt, they will only give you store credit. This time around, though, I threw out the receipt before deciding to return something. I told the sales person that I thought that was a really bad method and she responded that it's an old POS system, but it's "better for privacy," and, actually, "I think it's much better that way," she said. WHAT?!   Whatever. Little does she know that after a ton of discounts applied to my purchase, I actually got that dress for significantly less than she credited me. So eat it, mean sales lady.

No matter which Sally store you go to, there's always that feel that the walls are closing in on you because there's so much crap everywhere and the aisles are so skinny. This location is no different. Regardless of which store I'm at, the employees are always happy to help me find what I'm looking for, even if they're already ringing me out. They offer their advice about which products are best for what I need, and never try to upsell me on anything. Thank you!

My best experience in the many times I've been to this Nordstrom was recently with the ladies at the purse counter.  Typically I feel like most people who works retail in Scottsdale feels like they're entitled to be dickheads. These women proved me wrong-- in just a matter of minutes, I felt they were honestly helping me find the right bag for me, not up selling, and even encouraged me to order the one I wanted versus caving for one I wasn't quite sold on. They made personalized conversation and seemed genuinely happy to help. Wish I could say the same for everyone else I see at Nordstrom.

I purchased a Groupon to Salon Tru and for the first time ever, almost missed the chance to use it before it expired. I called early this morning to get a manicure, but they were booked solid. I've been wanting to get a streak of bright color in my hair ever since I colored over it last year so I asked if that was possible and what the cost would be. I remember being told was that it would be $90, so I asked the cost without the blow dry, and I was told $45. Perfect, the Groupon was for $50. The woman on the phone was SO nice and cheery and so I expected equal service in the salon.  I got in about 4 minutes late, and was kind of ignored until I moved to stand directly in front of the receptionist's line of vision. Both she and another woman who came out a few minutes later were not very welcoming. It was 2:10 or so by now and Colleen came to pick me up and we went to her chair. I described what I wanted. She seemed to be having one of those days.. or maybe that's just her personality. She went back to check on hair dye colors and returned after what felt like 5 minutes. I decided on purple, so she went to the back again to mix the bleach. 5 minutes later, just as she was about to apply the bleach to literally a 1" section of hair, I asked how much it would be, because I had a feeling something was weird. She told me "umm, probably $75." I told her that's not what I was quoted, and that's not what I was willing to pay. I'd blow dry my own hair if I had to, but $75 for a tiny piece of hair was ridiculous. She told me the person on the phone was wrong and her prices "start at $45" but was based on sitting time. (So apparently if you have darker hair, you get screwed and have to pay more than people with lighter hair because it takes longer?) She again disappeared to the back to "ask someone" what could be done, and came back saying she could put in fake purple extensions for the Groupon price. Fine, sure, not at all what I wanted, but okay. I asked what colors, decided on purple again, and when she came back, I didn't like the color of the extensions, they were a faded purple. She went back again to bring out the other colors, one of which was a richer purple (why wouldn't she just grab them all in the first place?) I ended up doing 4 pieces for $50.  I am really put out with the customer service experience and will not go back, unfortunately. If you want an experience ten times better, try going to Dolce.

Customer service is not a focus of this office. Staff behind the desk aren't happy when they greet you and they definitely do not appreciate when it's 20 minutes past your appointment time and you ask them when you'll be seen. Nor do they appreciate it when it's 45 minutes or 60 minutes past your appointment time and you, again, ask what gives. The nurses generally are fine once they escort you in to a room, but they don't exactly provide a warm and welcoming experience.   I've been going here for over a year, and just about every single time I call and need to speak to a nurse, I have to re-explain my question or issue multiple times. Often I'll be put on hold after I've explained my problem and then someone else will pick up and have no idea why I've just been transferred to them. You can't ever speak directly to a nurse without first leaving a message. Then, you're not guaranteed a call back the same day even if you call first thing in the morning. Hours are 9-5 and they have "extended hours" until 6pm on Wednesday. How thoughtful! Twice I have had prescriptions sent over to my local Walgreens, gone to pick it up, and it wasn't there. Generally, no one takes responsibility for issues like this. Every time I call and speak to a nurse they never introduce themselves, so I find it challenging to establish any kind of relationship. There was one nurse, however, that went above and beyond for me, and because of that I feel better about continuing as a patient here.  It's clean and a great location, but if you're looking for a home-y derm's office where they know you and actually care about you, this is not the place.

Service was slow, and the server had a slight attitude the entire night. We had 7 people at a large table in the center of the restaurant, and had brought in four bottles of wine purchased from the place next door. Every course took at 30-45 minutes to bring out, which was fine because we were happy and celebrating. Dishes were brought out a couple at a time, with a few minutes in between. I ordered a drink twice, which was really not a big deal. The server however was impatient when we couldn't decide on things immediately, or that my sister asked about the cheese that came on the steak. She and her husband keep kosher... she didn't need to explain herself, but he was not very accommodating. She also asked for some bread that didn't touch the pork on the charcuterie plate. She was brought a plate of 4 bite size slices.  I didn't have too many issues with this restaurant until the bill came. The food had been rich and good. My dad, who *never* makes a stink about price discrepancies, pointed out to the waiter that he thought the corkage fee was waived if you purchased the wine next door. The waiter said no, that's not true. My dad pulled up the Zagat's review where it says that, word for word. We just had 7 people eating 3-4 courses each, and you can't waive the corkage fee for 4 bottles?? A customer service-oriented person would have apologized for the confusion and waived the fee. A somewhat customer service-savvy person would have apologized and waived half the fee. This server said "Yeah, we've been trying to get Zagat's to take that out for a long time. It's wrong."  Decent food, but don't expect service to be on par with the prices.

George's is a Chinese place with a friendly environment and very nice, attentive waitstaff. At least 4 different servers came to refill drinks, clear our table, ask how we liked our meal, etc. They gave us a sample salad to try, and even offered another sample plate but we had so much food coming, we said no thanks. We got the Hot and Sour Soup for 2, which was perfectly spicy and loaded with tofu, chicken, and shrimp. We both had an entree and split fried rice, and had tons of food left over. Their website has a 15% off coupon which we used, and they were even kind about that, too! If you check in on Yelp you get another 15% coupon to use.  Probably not the absolute best Chinese you'll ever have, but by far some of the best customer service at a restaurant that I've ever seen.

I've taken out from this Pita Jungle location several times, but my main experience with them is through corporate catering. The Scottsdale/Shea Pita Jungle caters my office of 100 about 1-2x a month. The food is always hot, fresh, and delicious. They make ordering and delivering easy and stress free. Best of all, the price point is incredibly fair and the value is great for the quantity and quality provided.  If catering is what you need, I definitely recommend this location.

Had the croque madame for breakfast and it was fantastic. Delicious albeit a little pricey for what came on the plate (one egg? boo.) My only qualm was that it was busy even on a Monday morning and the employees don't seem terribly happy to be working. No smiles anywhere! Not when you ordered, not when you picked up your food, or your coffee. It felt like a tense environment up until I sat down to eat in the other room.  I love all the books, candles, and random stuff they have for sale, in addition to the delicious baked goods from Tammie Coe next-door.   Free valet, too!

We went around 9:45am on a Sunday morning... oops? 30 minute wait, but definitely worth it. Fantastic food, even if you don't get the pancakes. Our server was on the ball, refilled my coffee cup 3 times without me asking, and was clearly working hard, taking care of all the other tables in her section. I got the smoked salmon scramble and it was perfect. The bathroom was clean, which is always important to me. The only thing that didn't make it perfect was the three ladies at the hostess counter. Not exactly a personable bunch!

Home to one of my favorite dishes of all time; lobster mashed potatoes at Ocean Club. There are lots of mid-price home decor stores like Crate & Barrel, Z Gallerie, and even a few kitchen/cooking stores like Sur La Table. It's the perfect size to walk around, even when it's a billion degrees out (misters!!!) Parking is usually decent, too. If you do go, do yourself a favor and skip the giant chains like PF Changs and Cheesecake Factory. They're still chains, but try Ra (lunch special or happy hour), North, Zinc Bistro, etc.

Just like everyone else, I echo the sentiments: Good food, bad service.  I did takeout here. I placed my order, paid, and the woman at the counter disappeared. I sat there for about 15-20 minutes. Another woman scurried out, set down three bags of food next to me and, I kid you not, her feet did not stop moving and she quickly turned and scurried back to the kitchen. I shouted after her, "CAN I GET A BOX?" She kept walking. I picked up the bags and within the first second one of them breaks. Of course it'd be the one with soup in it, duh!  I don't really have the desire to eat there based on my experience and the other reviews, but I got a ton of food for $50 and it was pretty good.

All the reviews are true! I work in an environment that provides world class customer service. I'm so used to being on the giving end, that I'm left pretty shocked when I receive it myself. Tanner Motors went above and beyond for me and I'm really, really grateful. This is a business I am happy to support and promote.

I shop at LOFT all the time and 9 out of 10 interactions with the employees here leave a lot to be desired. One older lady flat out ignored me even after seeing me with a stack of 5-6 pieces of clothing over my arm. It seems like they're personally inconvenienced when you need to make a return or ask for another size. Every time I'm there, sizes are completely picked over with tons of XS, S, and M's. A lot of the clothes are great, the prices are sometimes a steal, but if you're looking for great retail customer service, this ain't the LOFT to go to.

I've done takeout from here multiple times and the food is consistently good and always ready when I arrive. (I typically get green curry and pad see ew.)  Today I went in for an early dinner around 5pm. There was literally one other couple in the entire restaurant and they already had their meals. We sat ourselves and were greeted by a waitress immediately asking if we were ready to order. No, but we could start with drinks. While I thumbed through the literally sticky pages of the menu, I asked for a thai iced tea with only a little bit of milk. A few minutes later I get a tea set down that is half milk and half tea. The waitress disappeared quickly. Finally when someone came back, I asked them to remake it with a little bit of milk. She brought back the same thing. Third try was a charm. (Best part about it is we were actually charged for multiple teas.) We had an appetizer set down and the waitress mumbled the name while walking away. Immediately after, I approached the waitress at the counter to ask for plates, napkins, and silverware.... how were we supposed to eat our appetizer? The entrees were served at separate times. We waited 10-15 minutes for a server to check in so that we could ask for boxes and the check.   Frustrating, because the food is decent.

I ordered a 7 beer sampler (4 oz glasses) and it was $8. Firreal?! I got the cochinita pork that was delicious, a huge portion, and came out lighting fast. My only complaint is that, as another reviewer said, it does get pretty loud. The beer was great, it's a fun atmosphere, and I can imagine the rest of the menu is pretty awesome too.

I only stopped in for takeout. Everyone I spoke to was very nice, they were speedy, and the food was delicious when I finally got home. I ordered soup and lamb dish and both were fantastic. Together it came out to about $21. I've heard they have a great lunch buffet-- I'll be sure to try that next.

What a great company this is. They offer so many discounts on services through their Facebook page, website, Groupon, etc. A hair stylist there told me I should never be paying full price for a service, and right she was. I would, though, because every employee I've interacted with has been fabulous.  Angella, the esthetician, is the best. She's young and sweet and so gentle-- she makes even a bikini wax feel alright.  I haven't had the best luck with manicures, but haircuts and waxing has all been amazing.

I just started going for manicures when I'm in the neighborhood. Eve is my favorite. She is so fun to talk to and does a great job. Unfortunately others I've had have been memorable in the wrong way.. a few manicures have been sloppy or bubbly which ends up being a total waste of money :(

Went around 10:30 on a Sunday morning and didn't wait much more than 20 minutes for a table for 2 (first available.) Very quicks service to place orders and receive food-- a little slower on drink refills. The prices are decent for the location. It's a fun atmosphere and if you can snag a table outside, it would be a great place to take out of town guests or someone really looking to enjoy the weather during breakfast.  I had the Lox omelette- smoked salmon, capers, and red onions. Incredibly salty (which is to be expected, but this was kinda unreal) but pretty good. The bloody mary wasn't my favorite, but then again I didn't try the bacon bloody mary.... maybe next time.

Friendly servers, quick seating on the weekends (with the option to sit outside), and very fast service. Different servers checked in with me multiple times to make sure I was taken care of. My only real complaint was the coffee was not piping hot and just so-so... but other than that, a good option for standard American breakfast.

We love this PetSmart location. The employees always remember our dog and greet him lovingly. It's really great to see the same faces there week after week, and that makes the store a fun place for us (and our pup!) to visit. We are on to our second puppy training class with Tracey who is an exceptional facilitator. We love coming to train with him weekly, and will probably continue classes even after we finish this intermediate session.  I had a pretty poor experience in working with Banfield, so that's the only reason I gave just 4 stars instead of 5.

Happy Hour is the only reason I come to Brio- where you can stuff your face for less than what one drink costs! You have to sit in the bar area to get the happy hour menu. Bar service is always fast, but you will be within earshot of the employees which is always a fun time. They talk a lot of crap about one another or their personal lives, which shocks me every time! I've sat with a couple of friends in the booths in the bar area and occasionally had female servers with bad attitudes, but I suppose I would too if my customers only came in between 3 and 6:30.

Hot damn, this place is good. It's a beautiful location, relaxed yet small interior, and an amazing place to dine outside when the weather cools off. Servers are always knowledgable  and friendly, and the food... oh the food! Everything is to die for, especially the foie gras, mussels, and the veal cheeks.  Go! You won't be disappointed.

I found this practice based on my insurance and proximity to where I live. The location is right off of the 101 and 51-- super convenient and easy to find. I was seen as a new patient and got an appointment for about a week out.   Dr. Siegel was so friendly and personable, and was the first doctor I've ever had who took the time to explain all the equipment and processes to me. The appointment was so quick and painless!  I highly recommend this place.

I love their scheduling practice-- you can make same-day appointments or an appointment the day before, so you can virtually always get in when you need it. The front desk ladies are incredibly friendly and always welcoming, and I adore my doctor. The office is clean, open, and much larger than you'd expect. I definitely recommend this place.

I haven't even lived there and I'm writing a review because of how horrible my phone call was just now. I talked to a leasing agent who basically did not listen to a word I said. I was very clear in my needs and what I wanted (1 bed, no pets, etc etc), and she sounded like she was reading a script the entire time. Telling me about the amenities and the wonderful parking and blah blah blah, I finally had to ask her just to give me the prices. I said I wanted a short term lease, under a specific budget, and needed to move in by a specific date. Continuing with reading off a sheet of paper she starts listing all the 1 bedrooms they have that are out of my price range, exceeding the date I need, and not even considering the short term lease I asked for. When I finally said "It sounds like there's nothing there that fits what I need, thank you" she hung up on me! If this is how they treat prospective tenants... yikes.

I agree with what all the other reviews say-- definitely a personal touch, attention to detail, and a small, comfortable location. I'm giving 4/5 stars because my appointment started 20 minutes late and while the tech was great at still trying to pay attention to me while I waited, I don't recall her ever actually apologizing for the wait.  Also, I called ahead to ask the price for a Gel manicure and was quoted one amount ($35) the website says another ($25) and then I was told that my Rockstar (glitter + gel) manicure was $75 but there was a special going on for $45. Huh? Maybe it was a lot of miscommunication, but that $75 price tag almost made me jump out of my chair.  TIP: If you pay with a credit card, they charge you $2.

I made a reservation online for Sunday brunch, and our table of 6 was right in the sun on the Bliss side with zero shade. We asked to move and were fairly warned ahead of time that the ReBar side was a bit less attentive. We didn't care, we just needed shade! So we moved to the other side and despite the warning, it took an unnecessarily long amount of time to get drinks, food, silverware, and the check. The server appeared to be pretty taxed, but made apologies for the wait and running back and forth. Several of the orders came out incorrectly but we didn't want to made anything of it because it appeared as though he really was doing his best.  We were bummed because the dishes were pretty bland tasting and average looking. The Bloody Mary needed work. The sandwiches and salads charge quite a bit for extras like protein or french fries which is weird-- the only place I've seen that charges extra for fries is somewhere like ZinBurger that's known for quality, super tasty entrees. You can charge extra for protein on a salad if the base of the salad is really strong. At Bliss is just felt like an unnecessary up charge.  Overall, the menu needs a little class. Someone with a good palette and eye needs to liven it up and make it more professional. I feel like most everything could have been made in my own kitchen.  It is in a great location, and the patio is beautiful and such a great environment, but I won't go back for more than drinks because it's just not worth the price.

I held my work holiday party at Clayton earlier this month. I couldn't have asked for anything better! The team was communicative, friendly, and made the process incredibly smooth and easy. All I did on the night of was show up!  The space is stunning, you can tell that just from the photos. I was blown away by the presentation of the food, especially the appetizer station. There were also a few other happenings that made me really impressed by the staff. One of my employees is vegan, and a server overheard him mention that. Without being asked, the server brought him a special vegan meal from the kitchen. How thoughtful! The second occurrence was when three uninvited guests rolled in to the party like they were employees of the company. One of the Clayton staff members saw me watching them as they entered the building. She immediately approached me and asked if they were employees, as she hadn't seen them in the venue all evening. I didn't even have to say a word for her to come ask me about the unwanted guests; she just was familiar with the attendees and didn't recognize them. I was really impressed by that! I felt like an attendee of my own party in that I got to enjoy it, and not the host. It was pretty incredible!  I highly recommend Clayton for any future events you're hosting!

I went to CPH with my siblings on a Saturday night and we had a blast. I felt like we were actually in a restaurant in NYC. Tables are fairly close together and it was packed, but nothing overwhelming. The cocktails are fantastic and we each ordered a few to try and share. Every plate we ordered was delicious, except for the dessert. We ordered some flour less mint thing (I think?) which wasn't that great, but everything else made up for it.  Nice location-- right in Old Town, easy parking, and definitely a fun place to go if you're looking to splurge on a night out.

Meh.  There are sooo many products in the store, it's like they're trying to cram in as much as possible. Prices are higher than similar type stores in major cities, which is a little annoying... why would a toy be more expensive in Arizona than in Boston, per se?  What I dislike every time is the service. They all dress like they work at Coach and act like they're too good to be selling children's toys. I've gotten better service from employees at the Louis Vuitton store.

The burgers are definitely decent, but I felt the portion was a bit small. We got lettuce wraps instead of bread, which may have made the difference, but we were still hungry afterwards! The sweet potato tater tots were alright.   Friendly counter service, good location, but I probably wouldn't go back.

I've pre-ordered from here several times, and dined in just once. Just about every time we order ahead, our food is messed up in some way-- we paid for chips and didn't get them was the most recent mistake. It's not an earth shattering error, just annoying when you don't get what you pay for.  I can't quite figure out what the difference is between this location and all the others-- maybe the age or experience of the staff? It just seems a little inconsistent.

I rent a ground floor studio.   Pros: - Good quality apartments-- granite countertops, updated stainless steel appliances - Good location convenient to the 101, 51, and 17 - Ground floor units come with "hardwood" flooring (although it looks more like laminate.) - I signed a 6 month lease and it was the same price as a 12 month. - Huge walk in closet - Built in desk - Small stacking washer/dryer - Big bathroom, beautiful tub - So far, no one has been too loud outside. - Valet trash  - There are multiple exits from the complex. - Nice pool area  Cons: - Prices quoted to me during my tour were different than what I was asked to pay upon move in. I took it up with the manager who could only offer me a free water filter ($30 value) to make up for the miscommunication. I told her I already had one in my unit, so she said she'd give me another one for when that ran out. Although I wasn't thrilled with the outcome, I thought the manager handled the situation well. - Either the person that lives above me is Bigfoot or there is a serious sound problem as I can hear everything and it is REALLY loud. If you are a light sleeper or annoyed easily, get a 3rd floor unit. Walls are paper thin, as well.  - No assigned parking spots. If you get home past 5pm your options of where to park are limited. It hasn't been a serious issue for me yet, though. - Not enough storage-- no outside or extra storage, not enough cabinets for the bathroom or kitchen. - Only one towel rack in the bathroom, kinda weird. - You have to pay extra to get a remote to the front gate, otherwise you will be rolling up and entering in a 4 digit code every time. This is annoying.    Overall, despite the occasional frustration, I'm pleased with my apartment.

I've lived in a lot of apartments and dealt with a lot of landlords and apartment managers. Pietra has by far, been the best experience.  Every single employee I've interacted with, from the maintenance staff, to the leasing office ladies, to the woman that restocks the small gym with water in the mornings, has been pleasant to interact with. Any issue I've had has been resolved, and the issues have been very minor (garbage disposal, sliding door, etc.) Any problem within the community has been addressed and taken care of. I'm super sad to be leaving after 2 years, but I need to move due to a new job that's quite far away.  I genuinely recommend this place to anyone looking in the area. As for the unhappy comments left on here, I don't share those experiences other than hearing the upstairs neighbor. The front gate hasn't been broken for a significant amount of time (a year, at least,) I've never seen a car broken in to, and yeah, trash piles up outside the trash compactor over the weekend because it isn't collected on those days. But it's gone by Monday morning. There's dog crap occasionally because owners don't pick up after their pets, but there is someone out every morning cleaning up trash around the grounds, poop included.   Overall, I loved my time here.

Skip it. I could barely communicate with my manicurist. When I pointed out a spot on my nails that was from the polish during the gelish application, my manicurist hollered something in another language to the other employees. Three women came up and said "no that's your nail." When I disagreed, they threw their hands up and walked away. They also tried to swipe my AmEx twice before telling me they don't take it. Not a pleasant experience overall.

Rehab is reliable and consistent. Great, tenured staff, always delicious food, and the most relaxed, fun atmosphere. Definitely our favorite burger place in Arizona. Try the PB&J burger-- you won't be disappointed!

I was so looking forward to a burger from The Stand, but wasn't hugely impressed. I got a burger protein style, so wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun. The entire thing fell apart before I could even pick it up. It just felt like an underwhelming burger and an underwhelming experience. But we shall carry on and try again, this time with bread and a shake, and see how that goes.

There's typically a 15-20 minute wait when we come in on Sundays, but that's to be expected. Servers are quick and friendly, the pancakes are fluffy and have a hint of lemon zest which is so good!   My only disappointment is the limited menu. The omelets have kinda weird ingredients and are very, very rich. Before going, I'd definitely give it a once over to make sure it has something you'll like.  You get your bill and pay up at the entrance, so the turnover is pretty quick. Very good and efficient!

Spacious, great menu, and stellar tater tots. What more could you ask for? The kitchen was still open at 10pm on a Sunday (reverse Happy Hour, no less!) This could be love...

This is in the same complex as Starbucks and Jamba Juice and is a little hard to find at first. The location is a little strange but as more businesses move in, I'm sure the atmosphere will perk up. Great portions for the price-- $7.75 for any salad or pizza ($2 extra for gluten free crust). The regular crust was the best I remember having locally, and the pizza was baked off in no time. I shared a blue cheese and steak pizza as well as the Italian salad. The salad was underwhelming (although huge) and the pizza delicious. I recommend splitting... One pizza is fairly large! I would definitely return.

Decent beers on tap, great service, and mediocre everything else. Both burgers we tried had improper proportions of cheese to meat, very little toppings of interest, and there was nothing special about the meat-- you could barely taste it. It has to be a darn good burger to charge $12 with no sides, and that, it wasn't.  The website and online menu leads you to believe it's a much hipper, younger place but the atmosphere was lacking. It felt like a stuffy, dark place that older people would feel comfortable in, and it was mostly older people eating there.  There were two servers for the entire restaurant, one of which was also the host and bartender. They were super friendly, composed, and helpful. The water was room temperature which is a little untraditional for American dining. The music was awful... drab and slow.  Nothing we tried we would order again, and we're definitely not going back. Bummer!

Before working with Brandon, I had never been to a Chiropractor. I wasn't nervous at all because he came so highly recommended from my family. Every single family member of mine living in the PHX area sees Brandon, and many of our close friends. The initial consultation was very comfortable, and each visit thereafter has been a breeze. I came in first for an ankle pain, which he resolved in two visits.  Now I see Brandon roughly twice a month for the occasional back tightness. I'm by no means a serious athlete so my treatment with him is mostly preventative.  Working with Brandon has made me much more aware of how my body feels and how to treat it throughout the day-- stretching, rolling, specific posture exercises, etc. In addition, the very first issue I came in with, a pained ankle, hasn't returned since purchasing sole inserts at Brandon's recommendation.  I would 100% recommend Brandon to anyone looking for a great chiropractor in the greater Phoenix area!

Eva and her team at Sweets Unlimited have delivered treats and cakes for numerous events for my office and every single time, it's a home run. Eva is so pleasant to work with. She takes my idea and runs with it, delivering an amazing product. I highly recommend them for all occasions and look forward to many more treats in the future!

The decor and vibe are way classier than the Peoria location, however the service is a bit lacking. It's large, clean, and has indoor and outdoor seating, but it definitely is suited for the Old Town Scottsdale crowd. Their menu is pricier and more upscale than the Peoria location, as well.

I love Bevvy. It's a beautiful space with comfortable seating inside and out. Their Happy Hour specials are awesome and their crafted cocktails are, while a bit pricey, worth the cost. I tend to go after work so I can't speak for the evening crowds or service, but I've never had a bad experience during the week. The servers are really sociable, friendly, and very welcoming of canine visitors :)  Check out their burger, apps, & salad specials on Happy Hour!

We LOVED eating at Shake Shack! The ordering experience is fun, the atmosphere and decor are casual, tasteful, and modern, and the burger was one of the best I've had from a chain restaurant. Shake Shack is a bit pricy for the full experience (burger + fries + drink/shake/etc.) but probably on par with the price of Five Guys.  Definitely coming back!

We love this restaurant. We prefer to do takeout as the environment is a bit crazy since their grand opening. The wait hasn't been too bad, but the process of building your bowl can be a little overwhelming for a first-timer. If you're unfamiliar with the setup, it lends to an uncomfortable interaction of trying to order while a) speaking louder than the music and over the plastic barrier, a-la Subway style, and b) trying to determine what the heck the toppings or ingredients are! After ordering once or twice, you'll get the hang of it.  The ingredients always taste fresh and both times we've gone, we've really enjoyed our meals. The prices feel reasonable, too.  My recommendation is to start with the half salad half rice base and go from there.
