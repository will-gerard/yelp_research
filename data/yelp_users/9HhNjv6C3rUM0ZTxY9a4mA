Absolutely the WORST experience we have ever had at any retail store in life. We have been forced to use this location due to availability of a specific product, but our treatment was so horrible, we have elected to forego the product entirely in favor of never having to deal with these people again. This post would be far too lengthy if I were to detail all of the issues, but suffice it to say that Rose? (we aren't sure, as she was absolutely horrendous when we politely asked for her to repeat her name), Chuck, Wes, and Michael are the rudest people we have ever come across. We are consistent high-volume consumers with a contractor account, however over the course of more than a month oour issues with a product order and our subsequent request to have it corrected has lead to our being completely neglected and treated horribly disrespectfully.  I hope that this page is monitored and that feedback is considered by store management. We would be very happy to discuss the details related to our horrible experiences (over several months) in a more private forum. Please call James at 480-815-8115

Such a terrific experience with this organization! I was desperate for someone who could take care of my tenants (with a newborn and pets and nowhere else to go) at a moment's notice. Late on a Sunday night I called the emergency line, and the tech with whom I spoke (Seth) was helpful and took care of my needs. Early the next morning I spoke with the office assistant, Ashli, who was engaging and efficient - such a pleasure to work with! There was a ton of communication throughout the day as we navigated through the unique issue our AC unit had and what could have been a $1500, 3 day debacle ended up a $700 issue which was handled SAME DAY due to the ingenuity of the staff and the dedication of the owner, Jake, who demonstrates true leadership by being the 'last man on the job', out at the house at 10pm to make sure our tenants were able to have a cool night's sleep. GREAT COMPANY!

I have worked with Rich on a number of properties. He is truly one of the most passionate visionaries out there. I was so hesitant, initially, to hire someone I just found online but his pictures called to me in a way no others did. I am SO glad I did - his photography and professionalism is second to none and one of my most recent listings sold in just 5 days, no doubt in part due to Rich's capturing the finest aspects of the home. Thank you, Rich!
