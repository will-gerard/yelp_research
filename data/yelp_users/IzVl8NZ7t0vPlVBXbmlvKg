Called last minute on Valentines day. Elise was super helpful with this amateur flower shopper.

Price quoted on the phone was $20 cheaper than what I was charged by manager Dennis after I spent an hour removing the radiator. I was also told on the phone that they had my year and model of car on the lot. When I got there I was told they didnt, but the new model would fit. When I got home the radiator didn't fit, and they wont refund even though they dont have the correct part. So I had to buy a new radiator in the end. Waste of time and money. This company is a scam.

Best tire place in the valley! I've sent 3 friends here, and they've all left happy.
