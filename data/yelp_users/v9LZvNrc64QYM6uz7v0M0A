Minus the pigeons, this is a great place to live.  The office staff is helpful when you need them, just don't make any outrageous requests.  Maintenance typically fixes things within 3 days, quicker if it involves water or electricity.   And the pools, well the pools are amazing, though the main pool has been closed every time it starts to get warm outside.  My only true complaint is that as a tenant I can't use the swimming pool in the summer, due to some unknown construction (though nothing has happened yet in the past two weeks) and that it has been closed for more than half the time I have been a tenant here.  The point of having a pool, is to use it in the summer when it's 120* out, not just to look at it as it collects leaves and dust from the storms.

Sad...  We went there to make some copies of some documents and we realized while we were there that we forgot to sign one line.  We needed a blue pen to sign it, but we didn't have one with us.  At each work station they have paperclips, rubber bands, scratch paper, scissors, highlighters, and black pens, but no blue pens.  We asked the guys at the desk if we could borrow a blue pen for one signature and they said "No, if we want to use a blue pen, we can buy a brand new pack."  I told them we were hoping not to spend $6 on pens and they told us too bad.  Hmm...

If you are looking for fresh produce that covers everything from avocados to watermelons and everything in between, then this is the place to go!  The produce is always priced low, but the quality is still high.  Unfortunately that can't be said for everything in the entire store...  If you plan on buying anything boxed or packaged, be prepared to pull out your wallet (or cell phone, if using Apple Pay).  I still recommend this store if people ask me where to buy fresh and/or healthy items, but unfortunately the Walmart across the street has milk for half the price.

It makes a lot of sense why Cousins Subs keep going out of business!!  Rudest person (Manager) I have ever met in my entire life!  I was nearby the property, working and this older gentleman comes storming out of the sandwich shop demanding I tell him who I am, what I am doing and then proceeds to yell in my face, demanding I leave the property and calls me stupid in front of customers walking by.  And to think I actually contemplated eating at his establishment and giving him my hard earned money.  I explained to him that I work for Truly Nolen and that I was called out to the property by the property owner at a specific time.  He then continued to tell me to leave and that I am scaring away customers because they think there is a bug problem.  I told him that I am working just like he is and he still continued to belittle me in front of anyone who would listen.  I will now be telling all my friends and family not to eat her and I ask anyone who reads this not to support such rude establishments.  I remember eating at Cousins when I was a lot younger and enjoying it, but now my opinions about this company are the complete opposite!

The pie here is really good, though the Tennessee Lemon wasn't what I was hoping for.  The location was very clean and staffed well, but the prices are a little much.  At $4.50 a slice, it seemed a little pricey, especially for getting such a small slice!  But it was an experience that we have been waiting for almost a year!  Word of advice, get there BEFORE the end of the weekend!  They stop making pies Friday morning and they sell until they run out!  So, if you wait until the final hour on Sunday (or Monday, on a three day weekend) you may not get what you want!

For those of you looking for a diner with Mid-West prices, portions and hospitality, this is it!  I went there not knowing what to expect and found the plates to be packed to the edges, the service to be just enough without being pushy or disruptive and the check to be well within reason!  I will definitely e returning in the near future.

We went for lunch on a Friday afternoon and got seated immediately, which worried me a little that it wasn't packed.  However, that fear quickly departed as our food came out quickly, the waitress was very personable and the food tasted amazing!  I had the Manager's Special Philly Cheesesteak and it was delicious!  It was a great Arizona spin on an already great piece of Americana!

As a young guy, this is the best location ever!  Not only is it across the parking lot from a gym, but it is next door to a smoothie/juice bar.  This Pita Jungle more than likely has the highest concentration of yoga pants being worn.  As for the food, it was great!  Everything was fresh, the wait times were minimal and the servings were plentiful.  It was a nice meal shared on the outside patio, which is great in the Spring evenings and Summer nights!

This is the first place I visited solely on the Yelp reviews alone and I will gladly admit I wasn't disappointed!  I ordered the Harrington, a toasted ham sandwich with mustard and peppers.  It was delicious!  I also had the potato salad and it too was good.  It's a small restaurant, but still leaves room so that you aren't elbow to elbow with the table next to you.  I will be shouting out this restaurant idea when my coworkers are asking for a good place to go.  They offer your meals to go, as well as a dine-in.  If you choose dine-in, make sure to ask for the Wifi password.  If it is your first time here, ask for help, they can either help you choose something you may like, or even offer you a customized item to really please your tastebuds.  This place is a must when trying new places in your neighborhood.

I'm tempted to give this location 4 stars, but it has everything you could EVER want!  Between the smoothie bar, the sushi station, the jeweler and the chocolatier, how do you know where to go first?!  This place is a mad house on Fridays and Saturdays, so if it is your first time coming here, I don't recommend it.  But if you are in the market for a $900 bottle of wine AND you need patio furniture, a new dog collar and a loaf of white bread, this is your one-stop shop!!

Hmm...  Where to begin...?  The store is small and could easily be missed as you drove by.  The outside wasn't exactly clean and I sure wouldn't feel comfortable sending a high school-aged child over there on their own to get me a pizza.  We went specifically to try the bacon wrapped pizza and after we ate it, we weren't exactly impressed.  The sauce was plain, the cheese was a little chewy and the crust was burnt.  The bacon on the edges was too thin, so when it cooked, it just became dried out and crunchy.  The breadsticks were still doughy and the marinara sauce on the side was cold.  The only thing this location had going for it, was the professionalism of the Manager as another customer berated her for not having any "Fresh & Ready" pizzas when he walked in.  The only other comment is that there were random people, possibly employees, that were walking behind the counter and then back outside, all while combing their hair and wearing sloppy, dirty clothes in the same areas that they were preparing food.  We will probably buy pizza from Little Caesars again, but it probably won't be from this location.

This location is the definition of average.  The theaters are clean, with plenty of seating, but the atmosphere in the lobby is plain.  When you walk in, nothing jumps out at you as the focal point.  The concession stand is huge, unfortunately they rarely have all cash registers open, so the lines can get rather long.  The prices of the tickets and concessions seem to keep going up, which doesn't make sense, since they are still selling the exact same candy as they were in 1999, that you can still buy at the grocery store ahead of time for $1, instead of $5 in the theater.  This location has a brand new Dollar Tree across the street and a Fry's next door, no reason to not get candy for the movie without breaking the bank.

It's difficult reviewing chain restaurants because they are all the same, but I will say that the staff was very happy, the food was fresh and the place was spotlessly clean.  I came in between the lunch and dinner rushes, so there was no line, but still a lot of employees working.  Everyone had things they were prepping, but they were still attentive to all of the customers' needs.

This park is a great place to visit wether you are a resident of the Valley, or just here on vacation...  And improvements are still being made.  They've planted new trees along the pathways and are going to be replacing and adding more benches.  There is plenty of room to play an impromptu game of football and even a splash pad for when the temps rocket up.  They have several bronze statues and memorial plaques for those of you that enjoy a little history lesson.  Plus, every hour (on the hour), you get to watch the tallest fountain in the United States!

I am slightly biased as I review this theater...  It brings back a lot of memories from when I worked here (Harkins, Paradise Valley 7) back in 1998!  Back to the present though.  The prices are slightly cheaper than the bigger companies down the street, but worth it because the crowds are smaller as well!  The concession stand offers the same as the competitors and the screens show the same movies, so why not enjoy it with less people?  Also, show up for the first couple showings each day to save even more!

I don't understand anyone of the other people that rated this McDonalds...  How do you say all nice things and then rate it a 3/5??  I get that it is a McDonalds and that we all know it isn't the healthiest of places, but at least rate the location based on the individual experience that you had there.  As for my visit, it was great this time, just as it always has been.  I have been both inside and out and the place is always clean, the staff is always happy and friendly and the wifi is always fast.  This is definitely one of the best McDonalds in the Valley!  Where else can you go get a large soda for $1?  Not a QT or even a Walgreens, this is the place.

I love this place and I'm sorry for not rating it sooner!  Everytime I am in here the employees are always smiling, always quick and have yet to mess up my order.  I used to work closer to this location and used to eat here almost once a week, so it was nice getting back in there today and seeing the familiar faces.  It's not often that a restaurant retains the same employees for long periods of time, so they must be doing something correct behind the counter as well!  I will forever enjoy this food and location!

For a business that is all about their bacon, it is rather disappointing!  The atmosphere is great and fun.  The service was decent, it was moderately busy, but the waitresses seemed overworked and not very enthusiastic.  But the bacon is what I had a problem with most!!  The signs all around the business talk about bacon and how they have 8 different flavors to try.  So, I ordered a full flight of bacon, one piece of all 8 flavors.  To say it was impressive would be a lie.  Most of the flavors tasted very similar, while a couple of them had no taste at all.  I did like the flavors of the Jalapeño and Apple Cider bacon, but the rest were rather "run of the mill".  The biggest turn-off was the size of the bacon, it was so small and not worth the value!  For an 8-piece plate, it costs $8.99!  That's over $1 a slice and they were so small!  I was expecting some thick cuts of bacon, something that would be a mouthful and give you a full sense of their quality food, but it was rather the opposite.  I don't think I will be going back there again.  For the same price, I could have ordered an entire meal, instead what I got was a medium-sized snack.

I love this sushi restaurant!  They have a conveyor system that you will either love or hate, depending on how far you are from the sushi station.  The food is priced per plate, but it is still very reasonable.  If you are planning on going for Happy Hour, get there towards the beginning, it can fill up fast and take awhile to rotate through the customers.  The staff is very attentive, even if they don't appear to be.  They don't hover over your table, but they magically arrive at the exact moment your soda goes empty.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good sushi at a good price.

The beer was plentiful, the food was fresh and the atmosphere was perfect.  Being in Munich (or Vegas) is the only thing better!

This was my first time visiting this brewery and it was very enjoyable.  We got a table out on the patio and enjoyed the warm air and the nice view of Shea!  I ordered a sour and it was delicious, the perfect beer to sip, while enjoying the fresh baked pizza.  The servers were very friendly and more than accommodating.  We will definitely be back again in the near future.

WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!  The only good part of this experience was the drive home, agreeing not to come back here anymore!  We went in on a Saturday night, slightly expecting to have to wait to be seated.  But that wasn't the case!  In fact, it was so dead inside that they were closing all of the booths and cleaning up, only seating people right next to the bar.  Surprisingly though, the food took forever to come out.  It took 20 minutes for our nachos to come out, and you could tell they had run out of tomatoes and jalapenos, because they were fresh, like from the grocery store, while the rest of the toppings had obviously spent a week or two in the fridge.  Then, it took another 15 minutes for our wings to come out.  Not only were they over cooked, but the seasoning on them was scarce!  My lemon pepper wings didn't have enough seasoning to cover even 1/3 of the amount of wings that were in the tray, let alone all of them!  And the Blue Moon BBQ sauce tastes like garbage, don't waste your time!  And the worst part of the night was the carrots and celery they gave me!!  It was brown and mushy, on the verge of being a moldy wonderland, but when brought to their attention, what do you think happened?!?  NOTHING!!  The waitress said she would tell the kitchen staff (like they cared in the first place), but instead went and flirted with another employee that was cleaning. She ignored us for the remainder of the visit.  We were not pleased, so she received the tip she deserved...  $0!!  I hate not tipping, but you need to at least show me that you give a hoot!!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!!

Delicious!!  That food was amazing!  I have never been here before, but have wanted to stop in every time I walked by it.  If you are thinking the same thing, you NEED to stop!  I got the Signature Dish with pork and medium spice, TO DIE FOR!  I will definitely be coming back here again.  Thank you guys for an amazing meal!

Whether you are from Iowa or not, this place is a great pizza place to visit!  I am from Phoenix and this was my first time eating this pizza, but it for sure won't be the last!  I loved the taco pizza and the BLT pizza, but I didn't taste a single bad slice in there!!  I would have given this place 6 stars if that was an option.

Where do you begin on such a fun place?!?  Games for all ages outside, a wall to make funny sentences with magnets and great food and beer, what else could you want for a fun neighborhood bar?  The atmosphere is all about fun and creativeness and it is very apparent the moment you walk in the door.  You can sit outside, inside, or at one of the two bars.  The beer menu has enough choices without having too many and the food menu has a wide selection of items to make anyone happy.  I will definitely be returning to this place!

Same items, different owner, completely different pricing system.  If you are looking to find an exact replica of the old Scottsdale location(s), this is as close as it gets.  After a failed business venture in Downtown Phoenix, the name has reemerged, but not the same "Ma & Pa" feel.  All sodas are priced at $1.99 a bottle, no matter how mainstream or unique it is and for a six-pack you are looking at $9.95.  There is still a big selection, but only about 40 feet of shelving.  The plus side to this new location is that it was bought by an owner that is already established in the area, so the chances of this place disappearing is less likely.  Today I am going to try a couple different root beers, but I will return to try other rarities in the near future.  *I'm raising my rating to 5 stars, from 4 stars and here is why.  I spoke with the new owners and they were totally cool, very nice and thanked me for visiting solely based on my recognition of the company name.  I'm still a little bummed about the pricing, but it is what it is.  Just keep bringing in unique sodas for us all to try and I will continue bringing in my hard earned money to buy them!
