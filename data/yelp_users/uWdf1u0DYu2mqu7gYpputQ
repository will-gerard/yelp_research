What a neat place reminds me of the old fashioned soda fountain that I vaguely remember as a kid growing up in NJ. The food and ice cream is great!

After years of neglecting my teeth due to a fear of dentists, I finally faced up to it. My experience with Dr Choules and his staff was very pleasant and professional

I stopped in to pick up some touch up paint after passing the store many times. The place is like a museum, a Allison j35 jet engine, a aero car, a 1100 cubic inch aluminum tank engine, and more. And I got the touch up paint I needed

Wow,  delicious pastries. A family owned bakery few and far between around here. Back east where I am from each town had a bakery like this.

I visited Cafe Rio based on a recommendation from a friend. I have to say the food we ordered was excellent. What made the experience a disappointment was how we were charged extra for sour cream on my tacos and cheese on my girlfriends burrito. My tacos were on the menu for 7.50 my girlfriend's burrito about the same, add chips/salsa and two sodas our bill rang up to $25

I needed a master link to an obscure x ring chain, I called around to 10 different shops, got nowhere. These guys got it for me the next day and one of them met me to save me a trip from Mesa, all for a 10 dollar part. I for one appreciate that kind of service!

First time at this Resturant. Excellent  burrito which I got cooked like a chimichanga then served enchilada style with a red sauce. Very tasty. Re fried beans probably the best I've had. Although I didn't have any additional tortillas, someone in the kitchen was constantly making them fresh.

Found this place from yelp. Was in the area for work. I Repair AC units so I typically want to sit down and cool off at lunch and am always looking for a healthy alternative to fast food. I asked for the restroom, they don't have one I was told! What kind of a place with tables doesn't even offer a place to wash up? The food I had was ok. I won't be back though

Met Joey at a networking event a while ago. I finally had him look at a older computer that was extremely slow. For a very reasonable price I got it back the next day, and it was as good as new speed wise. Now I have found a "computer guy" that I can turn to for support or advice on upgrading to new.

These guys are great to deal with! Worked with them on several cars for my family. I thought the service was very good and the prices fair.  I appreciate that this is a family owned and run business as well.

Stopped in for a cheese steak sandwich. Not only was the sandwich excellent, home made fries and a fountain Sosa was included. Very clean too.

I used Luis for a repair on a rental property, which went smoothly. I have since recommended him to several friends, they were as was I, quite pleased that he was a straight forward honest guy. My repair was done the same day I called, which kept my tenant happy;

Don't waste your time in the drive through. Saturday afternoon I waited for 5 minutes to order, no one responded. I had no choice but to stay in line. When I got to the window no one would even come and speak with me. The food is good I will say that much.

I have eaten here several times, I thought the burgers were delicious. I plan to visit again next time I pass that way.

Dr. Meagan is quite skilled at relieving my aches and pains.  I am 50 year old self employed tradesman. I am also a desert motorcycle racer. Needless to say I need regular chiropractic treatment. I have been seeing her since she established her office in Mesa. I highly recommend her.
