I haven't been to Vegas since I was a kid with my parents. Since my friend and I had a full itinerary planned, we decided to go cheap on the hotel, since we'd only be sleeping there anyway.  Price was great. I got my room online, straight from the Stratosphere website itself. It was a lot easier then the hotel.com travelocity.com type of websites cause you get to pick your room based on pictures. So you know you don't get those nasty multi colored comforters.   They do charge you about 10dollars a day for amenities. Our room with tax and the surcharge was about 50 a night. Considering the best western down the street from my house is 100 a night, that's pretty good. Plus free entry to the tower.  I agree that the neighborhood is a little gross. Doesn't seem dangerous, at least to me, but there are a lot of bums you have to walk by. There were two young guys that reeked of urine. Gross.  It's a couple good blocks away from the strip, but the Deuce bus is right there and it's cheap. Also one block away at the Sahara is the metrorail.   They have a McDonalds there too. So cheap food!. And an ihop a couple doors down.   When we went, it was a bit windy, so the rides on the tower were closed.   Boo!!! :{  The staff was very friendly to us. Our room was clean.   But the first night we were there (Saturday) there were a couple of girls in the hall talking really loud and woke me up. And a couple of door slams. The second night was good though.  The casino area isn't the newest, but seriously it's not bad. There were some nasty casinos on the strip. For the cheap hotels, I prefer this one.  Plus, we put in a dollar in the slots and won 144. Yeah!

A couple months ago my friend and I saw a special on the Wynn Buffet on the food network and were so impressed, we put it on our must do list on our Vegas VaCa.  We knew ahead of time, it would be expensive. It was like 40 a person for dinner. And we were prepared to pay.  The food was disgusting. We went on a Saturday night so it should have been busy enough for the food to rotate though. Everything I ate was dry and nasty. Like when you leave meat out for a few hours and the top of it crusts over. Or noodles that are half mushy half dried out hard. And the meats at the carving station was extra, extreme rare, borderline raw.   I really thought there would be more selections. But in all seriousness, it's not at all bigger than your average neighborhood asian buffet. Except it's stretched out in a long line instead of cramped together. Because asian buffets do have american food and pasta and pizza. It's nasty, but it's the same nastiness of this buffet.  I thought the plates were beautiful. But I don't want to pay 40 dollars to eat on a nice plate.  On the upside, we recieved very good service.They were quick, and continually took our plates and refilled our drinks. We were however RIGHT next to their waiting station though. lol. The wait in line was pretty fast too. We probably waited less then 15 minutes. (On a busy night at HomeTown Buffet, (in the ghetto btw ;P  ) the wait time can be a freaking hour).   Although our table wasn't that far, most of them were like a maze. I think I would definitely have gotten lost. However, like only a few feet from our table was a giant pile of dirty dishes, near the employee entrance. If I hadn't have been so obsessed with the disappointment of the food, I would have noticed that while I was there. Oh, but we have plenty of pictures with a huge stack of dirty dishes in the background.  I have to add that the line for crab legs is ridiculously long. It's a good 20 minutes in the line, but what makes it ridiculous is that the crab legs aren't worth it a bit. I got a plate full of it and ended up not eating any of them. I can't put my finger on it. It's too salty, but that's not the problem. I can' only relate it to having a metallic taste of it. I don't know what it is. But I couldn't eat it.  I don't know why everyone says it's so good. I am very picky. Or maybe I have better taste buds?

I got our tickets from the Phantom Las Vegas online website. The front page advertised coupon codes. Perfect! Coupons for exactly where I want to sit! Score! Which were front Mezz seats for 70 bucks each.   Comparatively, I bought the same exact area seats for Wicked at the Pantages Los Angeles for 120 each.  For 70 dollars I was scared at first. Although they do have a picture of where your seats should be, it's not totally correct. I was afraid my seats would be totally far on the sides, but to my surprise, they were exactly in the middle. Perfect. Front row mezz seats. The same seats I bought for Pantages. For only 70!!!! OMG what a deal. (I always get front middle mezz seats. My fav)  Okay, when I sat down, I thought, okay, for Vegas this isn't THAT great. I thought it would be bigger and i see three cheap chandelier things hanging in front of me. WRONG!!! It was so beautiful. The actors did a great job. The set hands did a great job. Every single second I was in awe, wondering 'how are they doing that?'   And I think how they ended it with Meg was so beautiful visually.   But warning there are loud and bright effects a couple of places in the show. You should know where. It was nice, but it really hurt my eyes/ears.

Tryst Cafe had delicious fresh food.   We were visiting family in Phoenix and were recommended to go here. As a LA native, I didn't have big expectations for this place. I was pleasantly surprised.   The restaurant itself was small but modern with a bar. There is options for outdoor/indoor seating. Food was amazing. I got the buffalo chicken wrap. I was a bit hesitant and fearful that they would glob on the buffalo sauce but it was perfectly balanced. Chicken was all breast meat, juicy and cooked to perfection. It comes with fries and they were sooo yummy.   Breakfast is served until 2:30 and after 4:00 there are a lot of yummy looking specials like lobster mac n cheese and some yummy sounding cocktails, i don't remember.   Price wise isn't bad. It's maybe a dollar or so higher than what I would call a deal, but at least they come with fries.  The restaurant is located in a plaza. It's a little hidden because I was standing in front of it and it took me a second to see the signage.
