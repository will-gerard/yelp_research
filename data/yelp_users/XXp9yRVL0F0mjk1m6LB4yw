I have been going here since they opened!  Lynn is my favorite! She takes her time. This place gets very busy so I suggest making an appointment!

The best Chinese in town !!! I have been going here since I can remember. The food always tastes the same and friendly staff. They have the best Sizzling Rice Soup and Sesame Chicken!

I have started going here and really enjoy this place. This is the biggest LA Fitness in the area, therefore it is always crowded but never had any issues with getting on the machines I needed to use. I have not had issues with the gym at all. No issues with getting onto the machines, smell issues or rude management.

Not sure hiw to rate this yet. First, the sign still says 24 Hr Fitness. Rather confusing when La Fitness app says they are an La Fitness now... I went in to this location to double check that they are now an La Fitness. I stated to the guy at the front, " I am not  sure if you have gotten any questions about this, is this an La Fitness? The guy at the front pointed to the La Fitness shirt he had on. I was turned off on how he responded to my question. The gym looks clean.   I am going to try the BodyPump class for the first time with friends.   I will update once I go to the class.

I have been here 2 times. Each time it took 15 minutes to make the drinks. The drinks we ordered where very basic. Also, stated "Merry Christmas" as my name and they did not put it on the cup, wtf? Not coming back to this location.

I scheduled an apt. at 8am. I thought I had an issue with my alternator/battery and Tpms system. I was told it would be 2-3 hours. I was still sitting there 2 hours later, no update on my car. I asked a guy to ask the man I met at the front, 15 minutes later got an update on my car. They said it would be another hr, 2 hours later I finally left. I was there 4 hours!!!  A bit after leaving my tpms  system light went back on......   They did find that I needed new front brakes and battery.

The best pizza in town! Thin crust all the way and they put the toppings under the cheese!

This is a great yoga studio. The flow yoga with Chris is amazing! I used a Goupon and I will continue to come every week. The teacher's here really care and it shows! So worth it!

Very clean and friendly staff. Best price for eyebrow wax, 10.00. :) I have had Jennifer a couple of times. She takes her time and makes your eyebrows look amazing. Will return every month.

Uber is so great and costs so much less than a cab. I will use this again and again. Drivers are very friendly! 5 stars!

ONLY WORTH GOING ONCE! Management take note!    I went to school for Hotel and Restaurant Management. There is a ton of things that need to be fixed. I was very disappointed.   I would rate this two different categories.  First, the service was awful! This company needs to have more employees in the restaurant area. We waited 30 to find an area "tables" where they serve you. If you are not in this area forget about getting a drink or food. Then we waited about 20 more minutes to place our orders. OUR FOOD CAME BEFORE OUR DRIKS, huge fail! We sent my friends order back two times. They need to have more than two computers to place orders. Have you though about servers having iPads to place the orders from? All employees who serve and or run food orders need to know the menu. Our food runner did not know what ingredients were in what my friend ordered.  They need to have cocktail takers who walk the whole area of the restaurant. We had several food runners ask us, Did you order...?  How are your orders printed out? No table numbers to what is ordered? They need to go back to training their service staff stat!   Second category, food/atmosphere.   The food and atmosphere is great. The tacos were to die for!! Way to go to the chef! Once you get to your bay the service is good.   I would go once to experience this. Not eager to go again. You would think they have various locations that they would have things down by now!

Best yoga studio in town! All the teachers love teaching, care about their students/their individual progress. They have a great deal of classes to choose from. This studio is worth your time for sure!

This pizza company is great, I have not had this pizza since HS. The flavored crust sets them apart. The sign is easy to see and was busy when I went tonight.  We got the flavored crust, butter cheese with pepperoni and Howie Bread.  I think I got food poisoning, sick from 11pm-2am. Not fun. Not going to eat here ever again.

I came in (6/2015) to try on dresses for my wedding for mid March. The customer service was great. The great news is I found my dress! I picked out a gorgeous belt that made my dress pop!   I came in 2-27-16 for my first fitting. Service was great again. There was a huge FAIL! The company did not mention about ordering the belt as well as the dress.  So now I have to go with a belt that is not the original one I fell in love with.  Now I have to choose another belt and have to pay a rush fee to guarantee that the belt will be here in time for the wedding! 13 days til the wedding. I feel that the company should of ordered the belt with the dress and they should pay for the belt.
