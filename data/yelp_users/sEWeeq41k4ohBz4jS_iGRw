Been here a few times over the last 5+ years but I must be getting older or the crowd has really changed.  The music was average, some Latin pop/dance stuff.  If I was exaggerating about this next comment than I would be a pig, but it's the truth, --- there was a LOT of very large women here, all in their shinny, way too short, way too tight clothes.  Again, sorry but it was the truth.  Had a couple of drinks and left.  Didn't even go hang around the under 21 section downstairs.  Just kidding, I would never do that.

Margaritas were tasty but a little light on the booze.  Complementary chips and salsa were better than average.  Even though we didn't get any food the waiter still brought us a white chocolate with pecan mini tamale for desert at no charge.  Nice touch, just for that kind gesture I'll come back to eat.

Yay for me, they open at 10:30am.  Service quick and helpful. Owner (I think) was present and seemed to know quite a few of the regulars. I had the panko chicken with an egg roll. Both were simple, yet above average. Quite a selection for such a small place.  All of the items I saw were pretty big or almost too big for a single serving.  Prices are a buck or two more than you might pay for at your average rice bowl shop, but it's worth it.  I'll be back. Soon.

This place is just hanging on.   I remember back in the day when they the piano bar, 80's club, sports bars, and a ton of other places to check out.  There a a few restaurants still open, but barely.  Never seen any of them even close to half full.  I pretty much just go to the theaters here nowadays.  At least there are no crowds to deal with.

Cool place, just wish I had been coming here more often.      It's in an old house so it has that cool "old school downtown" vibe about it.   Pretty healthy menu items with funny names that you'll be sure to remember, like Cheech and Dijon Chicken, The Very Brady Clubster,Teriyaki 90210, Gringo Star, In Like Fin, Rocky VII, The Veggie Jackson, and Bird Is The Word , just to name a few.  I had the Prince of Thai which I really enjoyed. Just spicy enough for my tastes. I tried the pasta salad as a side and was impressed that it wasn't oily or had too much useless stuff on it, simple is good.  At $6.95 I thought it was a heck of a lot better than a drive through or a sub sandwich.  I'll be back soon to try one of everything on their menu!

When I was in college there used to be a La Tolteca right across from ASU. We went there all the time and got the burritos "as big as your head" or at least that's what we called them. They were so good.  Eventually that place closed and I made my way down to this location.  This place is a lot of fun. Good Mexican food, a in house bakery, a small store and butcher shop.  This place is real and it a phoenix landmark, check it out.

This was my introduction into Indian food.    The first few times I came here I was like "ah not bad".  Then I started to try other places, even out of state and in other towns.   When I came back to IDP I really liked it.  If you go to a buffet, which I prefer, so you can try a bit of everything keep in mind that the dishes change daily.   If the food is not so good on Monday well go back on Tuesday and they'll have a few different items.  They had these parsnips once that were soooo good I've been having "nocturnal emissions" about them for the past year.   Cool little shop that is attached to the restaurant, they have fresh bakery items, Indian food stuffs, and a ton of Bollywood movies.

I have complete confidence with this shop. Super knowledgeable and were quick and friendly.  I took my truck to them for a second opinion and they found that the "recommendations" from the other shop were completely untrue.  I saved over $700 by having them do the work and not the first overpriced shop.

It's unique and it's in Phoenix, for that alone it gets 5 stars.  This is a fun place to kill a couple of hours with out of town visitors or on a date.  Stroll through the gardens. Wander through the grocery store, (yes it stinks but it's part of the ambiance) and look a all the strange and gross foods. Try one of the restaurants, but not Quizno's that doesn't count.  Check out the curio shops for some odd trinket to take home with you.

Four stars with a caveat, DO NOT ACTUALLY GO TO THE RESTURAUNT,---ONLY ORDER BY PHONE!    Inside is way nasty, it's old, kinda dirty, with an old man sleeping in a chair in the next room, etc. etc.  Food was very fresh, full of vegetables and the chicken and shrimp were both better than PF Changs, IMHO.  I'll order by phone next time and forget that I ever went inside that place.

Been coming here for years, always great service every time I'm needed it.  I've purchased about 10 pieces of lawn equipment here and they have been very helpful every time.  I buy the professional type of equipment, not the less expensive "homeowner" level of equipment so perhaps that's why I have such favorable opinion of this place.  This is my go to place for all landscaping equipment purchases and repairs.

This place had a hard time keeping up with the modest lunch crowd when I was there.   There were 3 buffet items that were totally out.  Not good since there were only a limited number of items to begin with.  I thought the taste was off, not my type of Indian food. No spice and no heat. Blah.  Come on, it''s a buffet and it's lunch.  Nobody has time to wait around for a piece of tandoori chicken.  Buh bye.

I suck. I've been going to this strip mall for many, many years and always thought "I need to check that place out".   I finally went and it was so simple and good I be a regular form now on I promise.  Had the brochettes, all were very good. Not "oh my f'ing God" good but yet very solid.  The lentil soup was fresh and full of vegetables.  I had the bolonanase (sp?) ragu.  Past with meat sauce but oh so much more when it came to the taste.  I cleaned my plate.  Keep in mind this place is BYOB. You sit on plastic chairs. and there are only about 8 tables in this tiny strip mall location.  Nice.

IT"S BEEN CLOSED AND TORN DOWN FOR A FEW YEARS NOW.  Anyways, this was my favorite bar of all time. Loved it.   I don't know why they had it torn down because now it's just an empty field.  How sad.  Oh the stories I have about it...  Sorry for the review because you cant go there anymore.

Way old school. I did the lunch buffet, $6 and change including drink.  It was actually pretty good.  Yes there were a few times I asked myself "exactly what part of a chicken is this from?" but the flavors were good. I'm guessing about 15 different items on the buffet.  I'm guessing this place has been here for 10+ years, maybe double that.  Red cheesy Asian interior as you would expect in a place like this.  I like this place, so what are you going to do about it?

Sweet.  I went to the bar, Geordie's, for my first visit to the Mansion.  Had a few glasses of wine and then started to wander.  What a neat place to get away from it all and relax.  The bar menu is pretty limited so keep that in mind, oh and I hear that this place closes for special events so always call ahead. And the view is not too bad either.

Not too bad. It's a upscale sports bar.  Food is pretty good and they always have wine/drink specials.  Usually not many people in there.  I need to put this in rotation more often, maybe a lunch or pregame stop before going out one night.

Gotta love Food City's.   The fruit and produce section is amazing and so cheap it's "almost free".    Any time I need a lot of veggies for a recipe or cooking some big meal this is the place to come.  Fresh tortillas and Mexican pastries made on site all very good.   Every weekend they have fresh roasted chilies for sale, yum.  I'm not into their meat selection, don't know why just doesn't appeal to me.  They have all the basics but you won't find much in the way of the "low fat" or "fat free" items here.  The ranchera music is WAY to loud, even for me, and I get a few odd looks like "hey what is this gringo doing in our store" but it's totally worth checking out.

This place from the outside looks pretty old, but on the inside it's pretty nice as far as bowling alleys go.    A few times we had to wait in line for the late night bowling thingy to start, you know where they play music and videos and turn the lights down. Rock and roll bowling or Disco bowling, I don't know, I forgot what they call it.  Food, no thank you, seems pretty typical pre-made deep fried stuff.  Beer and bowling are always good.   They put a ice container in the pitcher to keep your beer cold, but it displaces about one 12oz beer so you kinda get ripped off ----but at least the beer is cold!  I'd like to be more like The Dude from the Big Lebowski every time I go bowling, "that rug really tied the room together, did it not?".

Amazing!  From start to finish this place was incredible.  Great french host (Mgr?).   Great french waiter, helpful and funny.   The support staff was way above average always, plates cleared and drinks filled in a timely manner.   I REALLY like the fact they don't rush you and try to flip tables, we were there about two hours.   This is a quaint little stand alone restaurant that also has a small bar and a few tables out on the patio.  I'll be back soon just to visit these areas.     We started with a nice bottle of french wine.  For the appetizer:  Brie en Croute Creamy Brie coated with toasted almond slivers and wrapped in puff pastry, then baked, served with toasted baguettes and port reduction   The main courses:  Poitrine de Porc Provencale Pan roasted pork tenderloin crusted with herbs d'provence and served with sweet corn and goat cheese polenta fritters, sauteed pea tendrils with grape tomatoes and leek fondue  And...  Coquille Saint-Jacques a la Sophie Pan seared Sea Scallops served over sauteed ricotta gnocchi with a citrus and shaved fennel baby arugula salad finished with tarragon beurre blanc  For Desert:  Raspberry Brulee Chambord soaked fresh raspberry infused in vanilla creme brulee  ----- I need to get creative and come up with more birthday's, anniversary's, holidays, or some other random reason to splurge on a place like this more often.

1990's this place was the best club around.  Now it's the worst. I mean sure there are a few boobies to look at but that's about it.    The girls don't talk to anyone and ask if you want a table dance.  I checked around the room a few times and other than the three dancers on the three stages THERE WERE NO OTHER GIRLS TO BE SEEN IN THE PLACE, (well other than the ones in our party, but they weren't dancing).  We tried asking the servers to bring us some dancers, and nothing.  We tried to make it rain money on the dancers and told them to come back and nothing!  This was a "busy" Saturday night so you would think the dancers would on their A game, but nothing.   If I'm gonna go to a titty bar I at least want that stripper perfume sent on me next time!  I going to check out Band-Aids next time

Guess what?  I'm a guy and I can sew a button back on and sew a small, albeit ugly, patch on torn fabric.  But that's it, I cant needlepoint or anything.  I had a few items to be repaired and one item to get hemmed. Good prices, $5 per repair, and $10 for the hemming.  Very nice work done by a couple of friendly ladies.

So I thought I was getting a chocolate cake with Kahlua cream frosting.  Sounded good since we were having a luau.  Cut into the cake later that night to find that it was four layers of white cake with coffee/esspresso brushed on each layer then filled and covered with the awesome Kahlua cream frosting! Yum.

I come here all the time and I think this is the poorest quality HD I've been to in the valley.    Ask someone for help and 99% of the time you hear "This isn't my area I can't help you".  Why don't they just put that phrase on the buttons they wear?  Yeah they have just about everything for your fixer upper projects around the house, but the service blows.

Me 10 years ago: Panda Express, mmm good, and they give you lots!  Me today: Panda Express is crap. It's got to be the most average, bland, over-Americanized "Asian" food around.  I challenge you to find more average/below average food chain anywhere in the state.

Napkin mittens.     How is it possible to destroy a sandwich and it's contents in the matter of 30 seconds?   Let's see, they put it together with yummy ingredients then they must use a large stick to shove it in the wrapper.  Nice party trick but not good at a restaurant.  What a mess when you open it, and I even had to use a spork to finish it.  Anyways, the food tastes good and the free cookie is a nice touch.   Oh yeah, the other beef I have with this place is the sign "Drink refills for large size only!" WTF!!!  I'll be inventing those napkin mittens before I come back to this place again.

I had been going to this shop for years, but I'm done.  Prices for basic repairs are way over priced and this last time I took one of my bike in they could not fix it and they still wanted to charge me for it!!!!    Then I come home and fix it myself in 30 min!   ---Go to Landis and not this place.

Was I there on a bad day or what?  I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold.    They have 15+ items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them.   Gross and bland.   I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was. Yuck!

Do you love big sloppy pieces of pork fat covered in barbecue sauce? If so please come here!!  I'll be as nice as I can since I've only been here once and only had one item.     I had open faced pork sandwich with a side of coleslaw.   The pork was sliced thin but was 50% fat. and no, not just one piece of pork but the entire plate of it, yuck!  They must have forgot to add the dressing to the coleslaw because it was bone dry.  Yummy, I love raw plain cabbage! How did they know?  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say I just got a bad hunk of meat because there is no way this place could serve food like that and stay in business.    If they change their name to "My Big Plate of Pork Fat with Sauce" it would better suit the meal I was served.  ---Re-reading my own review and now I'm pissed that I didn't send it back, I should have damn it!

Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and was very happily surprised at my dining experience.  The hostess was friendly, waiter funny and attentive, and other staff said goodbye to us as we left.  Had to have edamame to start of course, and for the first time ever at a Japanese restaurant, they were steaming hot and not over salted.  I had the salmon roll and a shrimp tempura roll. Tasty and fresh.  ---sorry but I'm not a fan of shashimi, so I stick to rolls.  Had another dish called "Dragon Tails" which was chicken stir fried in  a spicy, almost buffalo style hot sauce. Huge portion.  When I peaked at the other diners across the room every portion looked really big! I mean at least two if not three portions per serving.  Our entree was out a few minutes earlier than the sushi, the waiter came by a few times and kept us updated, but it seemed as if he knew the sushi would come out later so why not wait 5 min then turn out order in to the kitchen?  Nice yummy, hassle free lunch.  Thank you Shogun.

Um, hello, this place has been open for over 60 years.  On that fact  alone they receive 5 stars from me.  Do they have some magic type of fryers that no one else in the world has? I think so because I honestly couldn't tell my meal was fried at all.   I had the fish, shrimp, and chips combo and every item was crispy, light, and as ungreasy as fried food can get.    The interior is old and outdated for sure and it's totally in the "hood" but who cares.  Darn good fish and chips IMHO.    ---PS, they have one of those pump thingies of ranch on their condiment bar so even if you don't like your meal just cover it in good old American ranch dressing.     Ranch makes everything better!

Best veggie sandwich ever?  One of the tasty vegetables was orange, so I think it was a sweet potato or possibly a carrot, no matter it was awesome.    Bread was soft and fresh,(I've almost broken teeth on some of the other really hard bread here before).   I find the service counter a little odd, it doesn't flow very well.  Hurry up and go here people before it gets too hot!!!

So the resort is great, can't say anything bad about it.   Sure, the Gondola ride is kinda cheesy I admit, but come on, it's pretty unique for the feakin desert.  Live music is usually pretty good grown up flamenco stuff, hey what ever happened to ESTEBAN?     Wanna go out for a drink, but not to a bar, or a club, or a dive, why not try a resort sometime. What, this is Arizona ya know.

So my electric back hair shaver (aka MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver)  was on the fritz and boy was my back getting a little to "Robin William's" like and I couldn't stand it any longer.  I had to get it fixed!  This place can repair any type of shaving device, add new blades, or they even sell you a new one if needed.  They also sell and repair small appliances, vacuum cleaners, coffee pots, and blenders.  ---Really I just come here to get the blade and foil replaced on my razor.   The location on Northern, and the one on Central are both closed now.

Yum.  Darn good curries, they seem to be thicker and creamier that other Thai places here in town.   The green papaya salad was good, simple and just spicy enough, although when I've had it at other places they usually add shrimp to it.  No big deal.  Talk about a shitty strip mall location, man, this place rivals Pizza a Metro for good food in a nasty location.  I suggest going to this place in the daytime, or pack some heat.

Open 10:30 to 2:30, so lunch is your only option here.   I would bet this place is really busy during lunch time, because I was here at 10:45 and there was already steady traffic coming in.      Mmmm Japanese food.  I had the Kobe beef bowl, and spicy shrimp rolls.  The Kobe was better than I expected for 6 bucks, and I really liked the spicy shrimp rolls, kind of on the small side but fresh and just spicy enough.   The menu looks pretty good from the pictures on the wall so I'll go back and try a few more items when I get a chance and don't see a line out the door.

Wow, so nice and shiny inside.  Went to see The Swell Season here and they sang a couple of songs off mike and their voices carried very well through the entire theater.   Acoustically speaking, quite an accomplishment.   No security guards, just little old lady's showing you to your seat, so I guess you could bum rush the stage and start a mosh pit if you really felt the need too.  I'll check the schedule and see what they have playing soon and then get a dressed up and act adult like for the evening ---for a change.  Bad news, they they had only two bars with one server each for the whole event.

My mini pitcher was $3.50 and then 5 minutes later a chick walked up and got charged $6.00 for two mini pitchers, hmmm, male discrimination or they can't do simple math?  I'll only go back when it's 110 outside and want to put a buzz on early in the afternoon.

This place is gonna cost me about $2,000.  ---- Back story, I was backpacking around South America a few years ago and spent a few weeks in Ecuador. Loved it. Great place.  Of course I ate Ecuadorian food but don't remember much about it.   Now after eating at MCMP I figure it's gonna be about $2,000 for me to go back to Ecuador and try the real stuff again so I can compare the two.  Anyways, loved the oatmeal drink. It tasted like pineapple juice with a hint of spice or cinnamon. Chips and salsa were standard issue.  The two dinners we had were very good. One was like a spicy carne asada, the other was sort of a combo plate with beef, beans, two types of plantains, sausage, egg, rice and chichron.  Our entrees were fine, but I'm really excited to try the other items on the menu.  Empanadas, tamales, and the chiviche looked really good.  This place has about 6-8 tables that's it. Only one person to serve everyone so if the place is packed expect a few more minutes for everything.

So I try to impress my girlfriend and tell her that I know of the cool wine bar in Old Town.  I write down the addy since it's been a year or so since I've been here, and then guess what? I loose the paper, oops. We end up walking around for a while and then finally finding it.   ---For the few people who haven't been here yet, there is no street front door, and there is only a small sign over the backdoor that says "The truth is inside".---  Service is great.  Tried the Egyptian flat bread with morels, brie, shallots and truffle oil. Hell ya.    Now the wine, I'll be the first to admit I'm a winetard, but I'm learning. So at this stage of the game I like the wine flights. 3 3oz samples of a similar wines.  That makes it a bit easier to figure out what the next glass would be.  Once you find this place it's great. I found it several years ago, I just forgot where it was.

Been here many times and always enjoy myself.    Good wine, and there always quick with the fresh bread to start the meal.  Chicken Piccata is sooooooo tasty.  I would like to try more items but usually stick to this one.    I had the LINGUINI ALLA CARBONARA with alfredo cheese, bacon, onions & peas and although a bit heavy, was the second best. The best version of this dish I had when I was in Rome, go figure, they know how to make Italian food.  Like 95% of other restaurants, it's in a strip mall, welcome to Arizona!

This place packs you in like sardines but that fact aside I liked it.  Had the fish special and it was amazing. Super light and tender with a tomato sauce (not marinara) on top.  The eggplant parm was good with a huge side of pasta.  Big ol' basket of bread.    We sat and chatted just for a few and the manager/owner asked us to move the the bar and he would buy us a glass of wine. Normally I would have seen that as offensive, but the food was really good and the place was packed so we took off and didn't gripe about it.

Best Japanese curry this side of Kyoto.  Other items are pretty good too but you gotta get away from the same old teriyaki people.  Food has always been hot and fresh.  Service has been great too.  I've been coming here for about 10 years and always really enjoyed this place.

Casey Moore oh how I love thee.   You helped me through college even more than all my classes and prof's combined.     You taught me that day drinking was an acceptable practice.     You taught me on many a nights that drinking and biking don't mix.  You even clean up nice enough that I brought my family and grandma here for dinner once.     Happy hours with co-workers you're into that too.  First date, yup, you're on it.  Thanks Casey!

This is my favorite Indian restaurant in the valley.   There are always different and interesting choices on the buffet.  Try the sauces,  there's a coconut one, and the cucumber/yogurt one is the tastiest I've ever had.  I've been here 10-15 times and always really enjoyed the food here.     Atmosphere, yeah right, there is none just good food.   They open at 11:30 and I really wish they would open at least 30 min earlier.  I've sat in the parking lot drooling on myself waiting for them to open on several occasions.

Amazing!  From the first call to the time the installer left these people were great!     They installed a dog door through my block wall.  Not even a scratch on the paint or a bit of dust left behind.  (They ever bring their own vacuum cleaner!)  Now my lazy ass doesn't have to get off the couch to let the dog out anymore.   It took my puppy about 2 hours before he figured it out and now he loves freedom.  A little expensive, but it's so worth it.

It's all been said before, so I'll keep this short.  ----------This is the best pizza I have ever had. ---------  I've been to Italy and the pizzas over there aren't even close.  If it wasn't for the really long wait I would be here all the time.

It's nice and pretty, but it ain't no Wrigley.     I am confused about the roof, on two different occasions when the outside temps were getting up there the roof was open?  Why not AC, this is Arizona, you know the valley of the SUN.    All kind of foods to eat, most of them aren't typical baseball fodder, sushi, iced coffees at a game?    I stick to the beer food group as a matter of principle when I go.

It's hard to get away from everything when you live in a big megalopolis like Phoenix.  For a brief time, the canals can give you a break from our busy streets.  I like to bike on the canals and as it gets warmer I'll start to go at night and get the ever so slightest cooling effect from the water.  Get a map (from online or bike shops) and you'll find out that they more prevalent than you may have thought.   Go for a ride!

Sure fine, it's a Gelato store.  I've tried a few flavors and can't complain.  Typical pimple-faced staff, so if you stay inside to eat you might be bothered by the teen staff a bit.     My only gripe with every American gelato places is that the portions are still to big.  It was about 1 euro for a shot glass sized serving of gelato all over Europe and that's the way I came to know gelato.    Ice cream I'll eat a big bowl, but gelato I just want a few bites of that silky smoothness.

Dear Mr. Fez,  Please offer your restaurant skills to other establishments in the Valley, they desperately need your help.  Perhaps you could write a book on how to make your food, service, and restaurant atmosphere not suck.  I'm sure you'd have to include many pictures and only use small words because most other restaurateurs are feeble minded.  This world is not fair. There is only one FEZ but 10,000 crappy chain restaurants, all of which suck.  Please keep doing what you do and hopefully it will rub off on a few other places in Arizona.  Thank you,  Satisfied Costumer.

You know that scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High where Jeff Spicoli takes one of his Vans off and hits himself on his head? Well that's what I did when I went to this place for the first time.   Why haven't I been coming here for the last 10 years, this place is great!!!    I would say this is the best non-Pizzeria Bianco/Cibo pizza in the valley.  The crust is awesome, sauce and cheese just perfect!  The really impressive part is is how picture perfect the pizzas are made.  The lobster ravioli were huge, easily enough for two.  Baked Ravioli's were better that average but needed more basil or something.  You really can't dine here, so it's take out or delivery.  They have one table and a few other seats inside if you had to eat here I guess you could.

Great UYE here last week.  Friendly staff, but missed some very important details when describing the appetizers to our large group.  We were brought 4 platters at $24.95 each.  ----NO BOOZE!!!    ----NO BYOB!!!   So the "value" part of this restaurant totally sucks.   My combination of the pork something and the mole, which were good but not great, were incredibly small portions for $17.95.  I seriously did not have enough meat in the mole sauce for a single taco. Weak. Beans were average. Rice was tasty, but like another reviewer said I think they used frozen vegetables.  I think the Guacamole was $10.95!  It's kinda a nice place, but the prices are easily 2 to 3 time higher than what they should be.   I'll go to Barrio Cafe and not this place from now on.

$5.50 for a kick ass chopped salad, very nice.   I'll go back just to try a few more salads.  Pizza has super thin crust, about half as thick as a regular tortilla, but just perfect in every way.   We created our own pizza with spinach, artichoke, and feta and it was a very good creation if I don't say so myself.     Think of this place is a "Chipotle" style restaurant that makes pizzas, pastas, and salads.   Good prices, limited menu,  with clean contemporary interiors.   Sorry but I can't really complain, it was very good.

This is a great place to bring out non-Arizona guests. If you have any kids in your group they can feed the ducks and turtles. Usually there is a wait, but the huge patio makes for a nice place to relax and have an adult beverage, especially when it's hot outside.  Food consists of your typical Mexican entrees all with rice and beans. It's a couple of bucks higher than your a chain Mexican restaurant, but worth it for the location and atmosphere.  Recently, I was there on at Saturday night and was told the wait was 1.5 hrs, but before we finished our first margarita (45min)we were seated at a nice window table.

Yikes! I feel sorry if you go to this place and they make you sit on one of their dumb footstools.  Otherwise this place is great!  Great food, shared a bowl of balls and the empanadas.  Mmm and a nice bottle of wine.     Again, another old house converted into a restaurant in downtown Phoenix. Very nice!

Been here a few times and I always enjoy the food.  I think of this place as having good ,but not exciting or overly spectacular, food.  Service has always been spot on for me.  The dinner choices are pretty standard, but I've only have a few of the most common ones, Orange Chicken, fried rices, a few other stir fry's etc.  So the sushi thing. I've never had anything but the rolls here. They're big, more than one bite for each piece, and come with about 8 pieces each.   I like them. I know that a Crunchy roll or a Spider roll may not be true sushi but I don't care I still like them. Damn good I tell ya.

Cool place with lots of charm, this ain't no chain coffee house.  I just had an iced coffee which was very good and the red cupcake.    -----I'm gonna get kicked in the nads and/or have several drinks thrown on me at the next Yelp event for sure for this next comment.---   The cupcake was just average, and the frosting was even a bit grainy.   I'm gonna go buy a "cup" now so it doesn't hurt when I get kicked in the nads by everyone who loves their cupcakes.

Wow, the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever had. I had the coleslaw as my side which was better than any other I can remember.     I've heard that the ribs and brisket are very good too.   Reasonable prices during happy hour.  They have a lounge/bar/dance club attached to the dining room and it was much nicer than I expected.  Our server said Tuesdays are their busiest nights in the lounge/dance club area, (Tuesdays nights WTF?)    Interesting mix of people when I was there on a Wed. night.   Not the Tempe crowd, or Scottsdale crowd, or even the downtown hipster crowd.  It's the METROCENTER crowd which is just a mix of regular city folk.

Mojitos are huge and oh so good, pricey so try to come during happy hour if you're on a budget.  They have several really unique martinis, like blood orange and a lychee and watermelon (I think)  for $9.50.  I only came here for drinks so I be back soon for the food.  From what I saw and read the food looks above average,  I say great when I get a chance to actually try it.  The staff was very attentive to us, and everyone else around us.  I can't wait to have one or more mojitos this summer when it's 110 outside.

Four stars because I've only been here once, when I return a few more times I'm sure they get the final star.  This place reminds me of a European cafe. No frills, simple decor, and pleasant staff willing to help you make a decision.  I had a breakfast burrito, forgot what it was called, it looked a little small on the plate but by the time I finished I was full and satisfied. Yummy.  I wish this place had a bit more of a patio/landscaping, just my 2 cents.

Very nice place to get away for a little while.  It's big for a garden, but still pretty small and takes about 10 minutes to walk around.  Of course you should stop and feed the fish, and sit and relax on one of the shaded benches. The have a tea ceremony every now and again, which could be fun to check out sometime.   A few side notes, I have been to Japan and  to many gardens over there and this is pretty close to what I remember seeing but the scale seemed to big.  Also I know quite a lot about plants (Hello! Botany degree here with 10 years landscape experience) and the garden could use a better variety of plants and filling in the missing plants.

This place is great fun.  Who would have thought you could feel like you were at a German beer garden while in downtown Glendale.   Sitting outdoors under the string lights and German beer flags just made you thirsty for beer! Nice selection of draft beers, all were tasty and available in 16 or 32 oz size.  Had sausage sampler with very good sauerkraut . Fresh pumpernickel and rye bread to munch on. Simple dinner salads.  Tried two types of schnitzel, both were great, wanted to order the gnocchi but they just ran out and then had the chicken Marsala which was just OK. They had two accordion players playing classic tunes like the "chicken dance song" and "it's a small world after all".  Mmm good polka music and beer.    This place does close at 9, otherwise it would be a great place to hang out all night.  Will go back again for sure.

When you get a seat and settle in this place is the best.  If you have to stand for awhile (and you very well may have too) that part is gonna suck no doubt about it.  Went here on a Saturday night and out of the 2 hours we were here the music was 95% Radiohead and Thom Yorke solo stuff, that's what 5 star drinking establishments are made of!  Extensive wine list with a few by-the-glass selections written on the chalkboards each night.   Ton's of micro beers to choose from.   We didn't get a chance to eat here but the food looked like the perfect match for this place, simple, fun, and creative.     I'll be back for sure with my fingers crossed that they always play 95% Radiohead and I wasn't there on a special night.

Nice local non-chain restaurant.  Neither up-tight or pretentious, more casual and laid back.  Staff was friendly and attentive, I think our server was even "The Famous Justin". He helped us pick out the wine and told me about one of the entree that I really enjoyed. It was bow tie pasta with spinach, sun-dried tomatoes and chicken all mixed in a cream sauce.  Big portions so expect some leftovers for sure.  Thanks Yelp or I would have never know about this place!

Nice.    I was thinking about writing a big long rant about how trendy/yuppy everyone at this place seemed to be but I thought "hey wait a second, I'm here too".  Great food, great drinks, maybe just a bit pricey.  For a Wednesday night this place was packed.  Wonderful outdoor patio.  Good thing you can park across the street so that way they can't see that you don't drive a Beemer and spit in your food.    There must be some sort of shuttle bus from North Scottsdale to this place every hour or something, or how else could you explain where all these beautiful people came from.

One star because this place, during summer and during happy hour, could be tolerable for a very short time, other than that ----- Run Away!!!  The have the worst music mix on a Friday night.  It's ghetto-fabulous rap and crappy Bon Jovi (the entire place raised their fists and mouthed the lyrics to Living on a Prayer I swear).    $9 mixed drinks taste sooooooo much better, I feel like such a winner paying 3 x regular price of a regular drink.  $ 4 Coronas.  I saw a drunk chick fall into the little pool thingy, nice.   One out of two had fake breasts.   Seriously, I counted.  I entertained myself by watching the ladies in 3-4" heels sink into the sand, and their dates never never offered an arm to steady themselves they just watched them sink. Classy.  What Scottsdale stereotype's? ----------Yeah right.

Nice.  So I tried my first pasty today, and damn is was good.  I had the Shepard's Pie which was filled with meat, peas, carrots, and potatoes all covered in cheese and then stuffed in a flaky crust. They have many different kinds (about 25) so I guess I need to go back 24 more times or so.  They also have really a really good beer selection but I would rather drink all day at a place like Casey's Moore's and then stumble down here for the food.  Minus one star for not being around when I went to ASU and lived just down the street from this place, I could have biked home from the bars with a pasty in my hand.

I have taken two people here over the last few years, one to get their _____'s pierced and and the other one got her ____ pierced, (twice actually they had to re-do it over because it migrated).  Very professional, and very helpful answering questions and walk you through the process of putting a needle through your skin without anesthesia.  Yes the staff may be full of holes, stretched out, and tattooed from head to toe they still do a wonderful job so don't be scared.  Who knows maybe someday I'll get a piercing for myself.

What no mustard's?  I was hoping to find a homemade mustard's but didn't find any, but there were quite a bit more other offerings.  Some of the veggies looked icky,  sorry people but they really did.    Everyone was very friendly and quick to give out samples.  Would have bought more but didn't have a way to keep the items cold because we were going to be out for the rest of the day.  Billed as a pubic market and not as a farmer's market makes good sense because there were only 3-5 veggie growers there.  Most were jewelry, handmade sauces/condiments, restaurants, coffee bars, doggie beds, handmade crafts and the like.  As the weather warms up, I'll be biking down here very early and checking it out again.  PS: I also learned where Matt's Big Breakfast is, just across the street from this place.

So after coming here for the first time the other day, I'm thinking about starting a monthly "Golden Girls" fan club meeting and having here at Pugzies, anyone want in?    Wow, they have tried to keep this place unique with the entire building pained in the brightest teal blue you have ever see. The floral patterns throughout the place just want to make you run out and buy some Velcro walking shoes!  Anyways, the food is great. A half sandwich is more than enough, I don't know any people that could eat an entire sandwich in one sitting. Plenty of sides to choose from, pasta salads and the like.  Several soup options with a few daily specials.  This place is open at 10am (my lunch time) so I'll be here about one a week from now on.  Why have I never been here before?

I get most of my food stuffs here.   Great meat, poultry and fish selection. Usually and very good prices.  I always keep several of the chicken sausages in the freezer for a quick week night meal to throw on the grill.  Bulk items really come in handy when you only need a certain amount of one thing.  Same thing goes for the bulk spices.  They have Peet's coffee which is my favorite.   They used to have frozen pizza dough, but for some reason they stopped a few months ago.  Their doughs were much better that TJ's.  I don't care for so much for those big box grocery stores when there is a place like Sprouts close by.

Take a flying leap Denny's!  It's the Bear or nothing from now on.  I knew the portions were going to be huge so I ordered from the Senior/Small Plate section and  there was still a ton of food, easily 2000-3000 calories.  So a half order of chicken fried steak comes with smashed red potatoes, green beans with bacon (so f-ing good) big garlic bread and of course a dinner salad to start with.  Friendly service too.  This place surely doesn't suck.

---This is for all Subway locations.---    You bastards!!!    Why must you make it so difficult to make a simple, crappy sandwich?     This is how it goes, "I'd like a turkey on wheat." then they put on gloves and ask "that was a what again?"    Do they only hire "short bus" people?    Ingredients, yup they regularly screw that up too. Either a huge handful of onions, or peppers, enough to make you gag, or they may give you only a single piece of onion/peppers. As if to say "I don't like my job, so now I'm going to ruin your sandwich so you can have a bad day too."      Why Subway why must you hassle me every time I get a sandwich?

This is now called Fry's Mercado.  It's as good if not better than the Ranch Markets.  Prices are so low they seem "almost free".   Everything looks really fresh because I'm guessing they move so much stuff so quick. They have the same specialty stores within a store as Ranch Market, you know a restaurant, bakery, juice/ice cream bar and tons of other "stations" for lack of a better word.    Muy bien.

The Bread Bar on 24th St. is a cute place to stop by and check out.  Very friendly lady working behind the counter who offered me samples of just about everything they had, when I asked for a drinking fountain she said "let me get you a bottle of water", very nice.   The store also has cookies, rolls, jams/jellies, lavosh, and even doggie treats.  I bought a loaf of the rustic olive loaf. Hard and crunchy on the outside and just perfect on the inside.  It's a little pricey so I'll come back here probably just for special occasions, but I will be back!

Cheap, fast, and tasty.  The potato and egg burrito is awesome for breakfast. It's light and fresh not greasy and rubbery.   Had a few other items here before, the tamale was good but messy and not put together very well. The tortillas are very good, but I hear they're "authentic" and made with butter/lard or something like that.  Good breakfast or lunch spot. The inside is pretty big and cafeteria style looking.

Holy Crap Batman!  This place was shoulder to shoulder packed around lunchtime on a Wednesday!   Why, I guess it's because they have everything it the world you might want and at "almost free" prices.  It's the exact same layout as the one on Roosevelt and 16th st, but there's less parking.  This place is a complete and total assault on your senses from the second you walk in.  Norteno music on the PA, the every 15 seconds someone YELLS for something in Spanish on the PA.  Wild decorations all over the place. Everything is on sale so of course you need a bright colored sign for every single item.  Good news is that I saw a few signs in English and one of the three employees I spoke with there spoke English, score!

Wow, better than I expected.  Don't let the tacky fluorescent writing all over the front windows deter you, or the fact that it's in an aging strip mall.  Modestly decorated inside. Quick attentive staff.  I only had the green curry and it was a big portion and just spicy enough.  Lunches come with either soup or salad, which is just iceberg a few carrots and a drizzle of dressing. Simple but good.  Also included is a small egg roll which was darn good.  I had a yummy Thai coffee which was $1.95 and came in a really big glass.   I give this place five stars because they don't suck. I've been to the Subway next door about a thousand times and most of the time they do suck. No more Subway for me.

I really like this place.  Very tiny on the inside with about four tables on the patio. It's BYOB so that's kind of fun.  I really liked the food, I thought everything we tried was fresh and tasty.  It was served on a big wooden boat.   Tempura was average and nothing special.  I liked seeing the sushi chef and his helper making the food. He was smiling the entire time we were here, and in some small way I think it made the food taste better.  The service was all over the place, sometime they were all over us, and other times we had to flag them down.  A true hidden gem that's a thousand times better than a "RA" style sushi joint.

5 stars for the rooftop patio, 4 stars for downstairs.  For one night I was given an honorary hipster status at Bar Smith.   We met a local DJ Joe Dipavora and his lady friend and chatted with them for a while,  Joe was treated like royalty and everyone kept coming over and talking to him.  So I think I met like 20 other DJ's from here in the phoenix area.  The roof top at about 40' x 60' is small, so you're gonna be standing shoulder to shoulder all night.  But that is a good thing because you'll be with tons of other hipsters all feeling the groovy house music.  The two bartenders on the rooftop deck were able to take care of everyone so no service problems.  Downstairs the music was more danceable and hip-hoppy, and you could even join in one of the break-dance circles and show off your moves.  See I have no moves so I just bounced around to the cool music upstairs all night.  This place is awesome, such a cool vibe, cool music, and cool rooftop location.

The bad. No samosas during the week, why? The lamb chops, which our server recommended, were crap. The tiny quarter sized piece of meat was oh-so-good but they were full of fat and bones, so it was about $12  for 5 bites of lamb and a plate of bones.   The good. Nicely styled restaurant, bright colors and modern open layout. The appetizer we ordered was a veggie patty on a bed of spicy chickpeas. The lamb vindaloos was one of the best I've had. The garlic naan was perfect.  Complementary chai is available, I thought is was a bit week but good none the less.  PS: No belly dancers here on a Wed evening. Maybe they have them here on the weekends like they do in Scottsdale.

100 percent authentic dining experience, I felt like I was in  another country.  My shawawma pita had very good flavor with just the right spices.  The hummus was good, but I prefer the hummus of Pita Jungle to be honest.  Can't wait to go back and try more items menu looks great.  Keep in mind this is a deli, not a fancy restaurant, so you order at the counter and dine on small uneven tables.  Good lunch spot.    Everything in the deli/store looked very good with some unusual items.

Again, Great drinks, great service, great happy hours, and great style but I never have any luck with the food here.   This time the bread was not crunchy, it was stale. Appetizer FAIL. Then tried the special of the day, some ravioli dish. It pissed me off, $17 bucks for THREE medium raviolis with a little bit of spinach, pine nuts in a brown butter sauce.  Way to small for the price.    I repeat for emphasis, great drinks and happy hours, but the food is and has always been a huge let down with me.

For several years I have lived only a short distance away from this park and would find myself here all the time.  I still come here just not as much as I would like.  Let's see at Papago Park you can: ---Watch fireworks all over the valley, on the 4th of July ---Hike, bike, nature walk ---Feed the turtles and Koi near the zoo ---Look into the zoo for free and watch the giraffes ---Have a picnic ---Have out-of-towners take their pictures with a cactus ---Climb through a hole in a rock ---Go to the DBG. ---Ride your bike along the canal  Lots to do right in the center of the Phoenix metro area.

Brownies, yum. When I eat these I want to keep eating them until I feel sick.  I can only choke down about two in a sitting, but I've been know to make a dozen disappear in just a few days.  These make good gifts and ship pretty well too.

This place blows.  Staff doesn't have a clue about customer service, (except a cute waitress but she was working on the patio).  Food was blah.  Spring rolls with out Thai basil, seriously? Pho was alright, but the sides of sprouts and basil were almost spoiled.  Horrible, no. Below average, yes.

Garnish?    Yes, Garnish!!!  Seriously, when was the last time you had a lunch for $7 with a carrot flower and carrot "shoestrings" on the side of your plate?      The food is good, sure it might not be the best in the world, but it's very good for Thai .  Service is quick and attentive so it's a great place for lunch.  Large and filling portions. A simple yet comprehensive lunch menu.  I thought the Hut part of "Thai Hut" always seemed kind of dumb but once you come here it makes sense.  It's the original diner on the inside which makes it feel comfortable and  inviting.  The big picture windows and fun to look out on McDowell and check out the passers by

Could a parking lot drive-in coffee shop really be any good? Yeah sure why not.   This place is a bit nicer than a few other drive through places in the Valley. The girl was nice and friendly and made a few suggestions (it was slow when I drove through) so I got a Granita, which hit the spot nicely.   I don't care so much for Starbucks, so I'll put this place in my rotation when I'm on this side of town and don't want to get out of my truck.

1/2 of star for the REALLY crappy dog park.  I would put money on the fact that the person that designed this dog park has never ever owned a dog.  There's a good chance that this designer does not know what a dog is.    The dog park is 100% granite, 0% grass.  No areas to run in at all.  There is a single water spigot about 300 feet outside the park.  This place just sucks.  ---The rest of the park is just fine.  Few people around. Nice big open spaces.  Bring a Frisbee because there is not much to do.  Lots of Parrots in the trees and not too many bums around so that's kinda good.

Wow wow wee waa! What a nice place.  Didn't eat any food, but I will next time, I promise.  Tried three wines, including their special house Pino, and all were fabulous!   Great patio, ---no REALLY great patio!   Good service. Rockin' good looks. On a Thursday night, only about 50% full, so it's not like Postinos where you have to wait 30 mins for a table.

Kick ass fries.   No more McCrappy meals for me ever again!!!  Went through the drive through, got my food and started driving away. Started to eat the fries and went "hmmm something different about them".  They were perfect! Potatoes, oil, salt, that's it. Not the tiniest bit of grease on my hands or the bag and cooked perfectly.  The burger was the best fast food burger I have ever had, seriously.  Again, they keep it simple.  Toasted bun, tasty meat and not greasy at all. How'd they do that?  People, next time you need fast food, and I know you all eat it don't lie, go here and see for yourself.   The chains are crap, this place does it right, and it's a cool find your friends don't know about.

Went there on a Sunday and ended up being the only people in the place.  So the service was fine and the two items we ordered were very good.  A salmon sandwich and a turkey burger with veggie slaw.  I'd go back.

Went here because of the reviews on Yelp,  very good.   Had the green papaya salad, great light taste and a very large portion with a few shrimp on top.   Had two types of curries and both of them were very tasty. I need more of that green papaya salad so I'll go back and try a few different things.

Cool trendy somewhat western interiors.  Good place to go at Westgate when you're in need of some libations and you don't want to go to a half-ass chain restaurant.  I felt like the crown was relaxed and pretty cool.  Not much silicone or muscle heads just regular 20 to 30 somethings enjoying their drinks.  I'm not much on the west side drinking places but I'd recommend this place to someone if they asked, I kinda liked it.  Drinks were priced right and the cute waitress always kept up with us when we needed something.

Cute little contemporary sushi bar tucked into an unassuming strip mall.   I'm not big into the sashimi part of the sushi world so I stick to the specialty rolls for the most part.    I enjoyed all the rolls I tasted about 6 or so.   The Rasta with spicy tuna was very good, Surf and Turf was different but good,  one with tempura chicken  was fine, soft shell crab was tasty and fun to look at with it's big legs and claws sticking out of the rolls.  I think they just opened a few weeks ago and don't have ordering system down  yet, they kept bring out several items that we didn't order.  Other than that this is a good place to drop in and get some good hassle free sushi.

It's brand new so it doesn't smell fishy yet.   It will soon just like all other Asian markets.  Looks like they will have another place to eat inside but it's still under construction from what I can tell.  They have Durian, I really want to try one because they are supposed to be so gross and stink to high heaven.  Banana blossoms?  How would I cook those things.  Food is divided into "Regions" so if you want Japanese noodles you go to one isle, Korean noodles in another isle etc.  It's a bit confusing but fun to look at all the different stuff.

Hippies scare me.     So in my preparation to go to this place I ordered Xanax from an on-line Canadian pharmacy, which I have been taking for three days now.  Bought a tazer from Spy Headquarters in case one of them tries to hold me down and pours patchouli oil on me.  The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippie-land.  It was all for nothing. No hippies around, just a teenager behind the counter.  This place is tiny and the counters are about at mouth level. I don't know how anyone under 7'6" could easily eat off of them.    Anyways for $5 flat, you get a kick ass burger, a school lunch bag half full of well seasoned skin-on fries, and a can of soda.   It's true that the fries could have been a bit more crispy but they tasted so good I got over it real quick.  I'd be afraid to ask what the special ingredient is because they might say "it's organic, don't panic".    Jerry's dead, but this place lives on.  Thanks hippies!

Only been here one time, but so far so good.  Had one of the inside out burgers (very tasty) and some cheesy buffalo chicken appetizer that was pretty good so I can't complain.    I need to go back and try many more items because everything looked so good.  Kind of a small place so it was loud and crowded, which I guess could be a good thing for a restaurant these days.

Carpets look great!   Price was very reasonable.  He was a few minutes late, but he did call and say something came up, no big deal.     He works valley wide, and is the owner/operator so you know exactly who you are getting every time.  Call him now!

Best "street style" carne asada taco I've ever had.    The Vampiro is basically the same think but it comes on a tostada so you have to pick it up and eat it like a vampire, thus the name Vampiro.  The salsa is great, I don't know what "style" it is because every now and again I've had it other places but it's my favorite. It's a cross between a pico and a red sauce, blended but not runny at all.  Yes they make you pay for chips and salsa, and I've seen the tiny tablespoon size take out container for salsa so beware.  Cute restored house.   I'll be back soon, if not everyday from now on.

Been here a few times now so it's time for the review.  Walked up to the hostess on a Saturday night and she asked if we had reservations, I said "no" because I didn't think this place was like that but then spending some time here it kinda makes sense, or Sens. Haha.  So one time ended up getting 6 (maybe a few more but the beers were going down pretty easy that night) different items.  Each one well thought out and fun to eat.  Yes, I said fun. One was cooked by us on a hot rock, and the others made us investigate each tasty bite.  Yup, the portions are small, but they're darn good vittles I tell ya.  Oh yeah, and they have a DJ so they get a few extra hipster points.

Check out the "Tongue" couch and stand on the glass floor look down the abandoned elevator shaft, trippy to say the least.   Great addition to downtown.  Sleek and contemporary interior.  Soon  they may have a club downstairs according to our server.  Upstairs is a neat, albeit slightly odd space.  They have a DJ in a small room over the main entrance, look for him.  TRY THE BAR PLATE!!!  It's about $7 and you get fresh shaved Parmesan and prosciutto, melon and bread.   It's so F'ing good.  They have Pimm's, but I don't know to much about it but it tasted OK to me.  ---IMPORTANT: the "pizzas" are not normal, they are super thin, I mean like 1/2 of a tortilla thin.  Tasty, but not a filling as a normal thin crust pizza.  Darn snazzy place.

They make their own tonic.  Let me repeat for emphasis, ---they make their own tonic people!!!!   Neat place, 100% hidden in an old neighborhood.   So I've only been here once and only had one drink, but I'm so ready to go back soon.  I'll update my review as soon as I eat some food here, promise.

I really enjoy this place. It's beautifully designed. It's hidden in a historic neighborhood, (zoning issues so no patio), and they make they own tonic! ---What else does one need?   But now the food. Rich, full flavored, comfort food. I don't think there is a cuisine style here as far as I could tell, just some of the best food around.   Had the fontina crusted with pinko and walnuts, awesome. A potato side dish, damn good I tell you. For the main course the skirt steak, which was some of the best red meat I'm had in a very, very long time.   This is my vote for best new restaurant in Phoenix. Seriously.

Cool little place, it only takes about 30 people to fill this place up, so keep that in mind if you have a group of people.    Nice addition to central phoenix drinking establishments.    Almost upscale but not quite. It's one of those trendy contemporary interiors.  It's above a Pei Wei, so that simple fact keeps it from getting the fifth star.  Sorry but true.  They give all you smokers a big "screw you" by making you smoke on the tiny fire escape.  Ha Ha suckers.

This place was once known as J Chew and Company. I loved that place and this new version is still great.  So comfy, so casual, so welcoming and so non-scottsdaley it's just the best.

So by now everyone knows about the Starbucks running water fiasco, right?  http://abcnews.go.com/International/SmartHome/Story?id=5964908&page=1  I drive up to the "almost in the hood" new store, and while I'm waiting for my grande, extra hot caramel macciado with half 2% milk and half whole milk, one splenda, no whipped cream, but drizzle the caramel on top?  Oh yeah, and can I have it double-cupped instead of one of those sleevey-things and while I'm waiting at the window I look over and see that little friggin spigot just running for no apparent reason. WTF I say, it's true.     They let the water run all the time!  What ass-clown came up with that idea?

Any place that has belly dancers shake their stuff in your face during dinner gets high marks in my book.  I think the belly dancer(s) are there only on the weekends around 8, but you might want to check it out.  Loved the food.   Garlic naan, very good.  The kitchen is partially open which is nice because you can see them put the meat skewers out of the ovens (maybe they call them tandoors or something) anyways very good food.  I bit more upscale than most other Indian places in the valley.

This place was pretty good.  One of those "safe bets" when it comes to pizza restaurants.  Nothing really out of the ordinary, but still much better than any chain.     Of course it's in a strip mall, hello this is Arizona remember.  Staff was friendly.  Food was good, but it ain't no Cibo!

Just had them out to cut a pas through/window through a load bearing wall.  Great job. Clean up and finish were very good.  Prices were reasonable for the amount of work that was done.  I'll be having them back out to do some additional demo at my place very soon.

If only they would have put the same amount of time and energy into training the servers, and working on the food itself, as they did on the styling of the restaurant, this place could have been great.    Value is way out of line. $4.50 for ONE below average spring roll. We tried three types and all had only one sliver of the ingredients listed.  We were given only  one menu when we were seated, WTF?  Another table near by saw that we had not been helped after about 5-10 minutes and notified the manager who was working the bar, and he didn't do much at just send some kid over to us. Was not given a drink menu until I asked for one AFTER we ordered food. WTF?  Summary: Super trendy/hip/stylish place with a least double overpriced food, inexperienced  wait staff, and  management who doesn't have a clue about customer service.
