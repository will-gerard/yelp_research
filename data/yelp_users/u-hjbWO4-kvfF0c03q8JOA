I was a first time customer of Dee's today. I actually had a pretty good experience! The staff were busy fitting two little girls for pointe shoes and managed to help me in between. Sure, they're a little pricey, but what are people expecting when buying the top brands of dance shoes?? I paid pretty much what I was expecting to for my BLOCH nude character t-straps. If you're buying quality, don't complain about the price because you really do get what you pay for. And as for not buying the correct style or size, well, it's something you learn from experience. It took me a good 4-5 years to know what worked on my feet and what didn't. It may be a size, brand or style issue and unfortunately, that knowledge only comes from experience.  I'm glad I went into Dee's today and I will return in the future! :)

In terms of Starbucks, this one is definitely my favorite! The service is always friendly and prompt, the drinks and food are just as good as I expect every time I come in, and the store has nice, comfy chairs in addition to tables--perfect for hanging out with a friend, reading a book or typing a paper. I love coming in for a green iced tea (no Classic) and being cheerfully greeted by name! It's the little things in life--like a perfectly made grande iced White Mocha (no whip) handed over with a "Have a nice day!" and a smile--that can totally make your day :]

You KNOW a restaurant is great when you go somewhere else and think, "Gee, so-and-so's food is soo much better than this..." Dragon Wok IS that restaurant, the one you compare all others to... the one that tingles your tastes buds and leaves you wanting more.  This restaurant is a family favorite of ours. I can't tell you what to order... All I can tell you is that everything I've tasted here was delicious. Some dishes I'm in love with: Orange Chicken, Combination Lo Mein, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Gourmet Beef and their War Wonton Soup (yum!).  Dragon Wok is a wonderful establishment: The food comes in family-size portions, it always tastes great (they'll even customize a dish for you!), the decor is nice and unique, and-most importantly-everything is CLEAN (the floor, the tables, the kitchen, and even the bathrooms).  If you're wondering whether you should give them a try, the answer is "YES!" Dragon Wok provides wonderful meals, service and an environment that makes every dining experience enjoyable =]

Let me preface this review by saying that this is a reflection of this particular location, not the Jamba Juice brand or it's products.  I have been to this location multiple times before and never had an issue. This day, however, was a completely different story. Walked in and saw 5 high-school-aged girls (employees) socializing and no managerial supervision. I should have taken it as a bad omen.  I waited at the front counter for a few minutes while the girl behind the register finished her conversation (apparently one of the girls was SOOO sore from working out... Like, OMG!). She then proceeded to unenthusiastically take my order. It took about 5 times longer than normal for my smoothie to be made. Where the hell was the manager?? These girls were moving slower than molasses in Antarctica! When I (FINALLY) got my Caribbean Passion smoothie about 15 minutes after I walked in, I headed out to my car frustrated about how horrible the service was.  The worst part?? I didn't try my drink until I drove off in my car. BIG. MISTAKE. My smoothie was bland and disgusting. Absolutely did NOT taste like Caribbean Passion... more like shaved ice with a hint of orange juice. Needless to say, I was too pissed to return to their store to complain. Sigh... And all I wanted was a smoothie! :(  Completely disappointing and off-putting experience. While I still love Jamba Juice, I'd rather drive a few extra miles out of my way to go to a different location with competent service and consistently great quality.

What an awesome business! Friendly, knowledgable people that make you feel like family when you come in. I can't to tell you how refreshing it is to walk into an audition and feel welcomed! Auditioning is a scary enough experience without feeling intimidated by your environment and the people auditioning you. Here you'll find great people who love what they do and have an extensive amount of knowledge and experience. Oh, and I also recommend taking one of Faith's workshops... I took one recently and I learned some very valuable tools that will definitely help me in future auditions :D

Don't even consider going here if you need any kind if assistance at all. EVER.  All I needed was a binder, sheet protectors, print labels, and to hole-punch my script. I thought I'd be in and out in 15 minutes or so. Oh, so young, so naive... I was in here for 50 minutes. FIFTY.  I went to the copy and print station to get help hole-punching my 100 or so pages. There was another girl in line in front of me (with a look like "FML" on her face. I should've taken it as a hint. Ah, hindsight...) and we were both waiting for the C&P guy to help us. He was currently helping an older gentleman with something.  Wait. I say "helping" like he was actually doing something... He was really just standing there watching the older man struggle. Not at any point did he ever tell or gesture to the two of us in line that he'd be with us in a few minutes. He didn't care. AT ALL.  After 10 minutes, I finally gave up waiting and decided to do it myself. Took me at least 10 to do it myself (after 5 minutes of trying to find anyone that could help me). I left the C&P station pissed. Even though it took me forever to figure out how to do my stuff myself, I finished before Napoleon Dynamite over there finished "helping" the girl in front of me. I'm too frustrated to call that a silver lining.  When I (FINALLY) found another employee to help me find the print labels, I was told the wrong aisle. Again, I had to play "search and find" to find an employee to help me locate what I needed. At checkout, I told the clerk how horrible my experience was. He apologized (didn't really try to make it better), but the damage was done.  Look, if I didn't need someone more knowledgable and better office equipment, I would've just stayed home. DUH. And if you hate your life, you shouldn't be working at a job where you have to interact with people. It makes for horrendous customer service and leads me believe that my money isn't good enough for you.  We had some good times, Staples, but I'm leaving you for another office supply store.

Here's the scoop...  Picture it: This place is located near my house and the building had been empty for years (NOTHING had been able to stay in that building too long... Mexikenny's, Baracuda's, some steak-restaurant or whatever... you get the gist). However, yesterday I was driving to work and I noticed they had hanged a banner on the front of the building saying "Grand Opening!" with their name and I thought, "Hmm. Sounds interesting," so I told my family we should check it out for dinner that night (we like to support our fellow local small businesses).  So we went there for dinner... Ohmygodddddd.  Ah. May. ZING.  No joke, THE BEST Mexican food that has ever passed my lips. I don't honestly like Mexican food, but-like most Southwesterners-I partake every once in a while... but El Rico's food converted me. Yes, I now am a Mexican food lover. I couldn't even tell you what was my favorite. All I know is they have a great grilled shrimp taco salad, awesome bean dip, and their guacamole? Bomb dot com. And it wasn't just the food that made this experience memorable and wonderful... They have great customer service and the inside decor makes you feel as if you're actually seated on a patio! SOO excited to have such a great family-run eatery nearby. Spread the word... El Rico's Dos Mexican Food! :]
