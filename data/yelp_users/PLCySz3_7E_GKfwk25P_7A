My AC stopped working last night, so I gave Hays a call first thing in the morning and they scheduled Steven T to come out to help. Steve is a friendly and knowledgeable guy. He explained what he's looking at throughout the process so I understood what was going on. He was pretty quickly able to locate the real issue and replace a faulty switch. Unlike the tech from another company that came out last month for a similar issue, who just wanted to throw parts at it until it got going, obviously he didn't get get everything.   The only thing that the scheduler from Hays could have been more clear about is that I would be charged a diagnostic fee ($80) AND an hour of labor ($90) to do anything else. So the 5 minutes to replace a switch that had to be checked as part of the diagnostic anyway, cost an hour of labor to replace. Would be better to have been told it's $170 if the tech had to do anything more than come in and turn it on.   Either way, my house is now cool, Steve was great and the staff at Hays is extremely friendly and helpful!

It's like your back yard, but with a bartender and someone else tending the grill. Skunk Creek Flats (east side frontage road off I-17 just north of Jomax) is a great addition to the N. Phoenix neighborhoods and I'm looking forward to good times to come hanging out there. The food thus far has been adequate, but the real draw is atmosphere and live bands when there going. That said, the cheese burgers are pretty solid.   Now all they need is to throw some Buffet on every once in a while, and I'd feel like I was in Rocky Point! :)  Check it out!

***If you are the owner of this location, fire your "manager"***  Seriously! Went in this morning and there was a huge crowd. However, walked up to the register and no wait! How could this be?!? With so many people standing around waiting, I could only assume the order volume was crazy. Over the next 20 minutes I realized why. I also realized why everyone standing around looked so grumpy on beautiful Saturday morning. The food coming out for pickup trickled out at about one bagel every minute and a half. The gross incompetence of the staff of 6+ was incredible! They were like a team of Shaggys from Scooby Doo. It actually was comical how slow and disorganized this crew was run, the hordes of waiting frustrated customers finding camaraderie in the lunacy.   After 20 minutes we decided to get a refund because we needed to get somewhere. Terrible!

Great Tap List! Poor Service  We went on a weekday night, so not exactly in the middle of peak time. The tap list is probably the best on Scottsdale and Shea! However if you actually want to eat, or get a second beer you're probably going to have to wait a while. When food finally does arrive, don't expect anyone to come back to your side of the bar for follow-up (we were literally sitting at the bar!!!). So... If you're just going there to have a few beers or pick up take-out (the food is pretty good), this is a good spot. If on the other hand you plan on eating there, bring your patience and drink another beer. :)  -Rich

This place has a pretty good breakfast. Some friends flew in from Portland and after a long evening the night before we were looking for a place to lick our wounds and kick the morning off (I guess it was actually afternoon). Of course a hair-of-the-dog was in order and most places that had drinks were no longer serving breakfast, and the places that had breakfast didn't have drinks. So when U.S. Egg popped up on yelp as a good place for breakfast and served alcohol we were sold. Limited bar menu (no actual bar), but a couple Bloody Mary's and Greyhounds on the patio was exactly what we all needed. Food was pretty good, and we realized it's only a few blocks from Turf Paradise! So in closing, good breakfast served in the afternoon, limited but what we needed bar menu, and close to the ponies... umm, yes please!  -Rich

Helton Brewing Company is a great new additionto the Phoenix beer scene. Cool vibe throughout, ask for a tour! The IPA just released is super solid, can't wait for what's to come! Stop in, enjoy a good beer and say "hi" to Brian.   PS: definitelytry some of the awesome cheeses offered!
