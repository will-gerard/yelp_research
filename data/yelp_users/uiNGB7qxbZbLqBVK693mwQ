We booked our dinner reservations on Open Table. When we got there, the staff was friendly, inviting and offered us a seat in the patio while our table was prepared. We celebrated my girlfriends birthday with our kids. The food was excellent. While waiting for the food, we noticed we forgot to order salads for whatever reason. Anyway's, the excitement of eating there overlapped the waiter not asking us about the salads. Great time, we'll be back.

1st time at this place and it will be my last. The service was terrible. The food was mixed up and the cashier was handling our food without gloves. Unbelievable!

Great place! I recently had my yearly exam. I was worried about an upcoming sinus surgery. Dr. Heetland was very informative and gave me the attention answering all my questions. He worked with me on my lens and contacts for after surgery. 5 Stars, great place great people.
