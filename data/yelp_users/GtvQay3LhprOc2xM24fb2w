I don't know why we come back here -- I will say it's close to us and that's the only reason. My boyfriend and I have sat at the bar, the patio tables near the bar and the booths in the bar area and have waited for at least 15 minutes waiting for a server to greet us. Mind you, several of them walked by and we were staring at the bartenders who certainly noticed us with nothing in front of us and did nothing. The hostesses always look at us like we're crazy for asking for a server to come by, particularly the girl with the red hair. My boyfriend returned his soda very politely letting our server know it's flat, yet they continued to give him flat sodas. I specifically asked for regular salmon in my philly roll, as opposed to smoked salmon and accepted the $2 up charge to do that (no idea why it costs $2 to do that). They give me the rolls with smoked salmon anyway. Then it takes ridiculously long to get the correct order and my boyfriend is already done eating. Nothing bugs me more!! Returned my order altogether. Will never be back.

Service was TERRIBLE. Salad was basically soup. We've been to several Zipps across the Valley and this was by far the worst. Christy was our server and she had amnesia or something --- she took our drink order, brought our drinks, took our food order, a manager brought our food, and we never saw her again. After noticing our pissed off faces, she came over and said, "hi guys are you looking for your server?" We said "aren't you our server?" And she responds with "oh nooo I'm sorry I'm not your server". Didn't you take our drink and food orders?? Idiot. Zero tip. Never going back.

My boyfriend and I cannot get enough of this place. The first time we went there was for Valentine's Day. Perfect drinks, perfect food and perfect service. We went again for lunch one day and the owner, Nick, came over to our table and introduced himself and made great conversation with us. These are the kind of people I want to give my money too! He also gave us a complimentary, homemade chocolate banana soft serve that was delicious. Overall great experience. Love it!
