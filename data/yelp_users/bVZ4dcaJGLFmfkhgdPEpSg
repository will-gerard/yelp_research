My FAVORITE!  Best Catfish, Best Friday Fish and Chips, Best Peach Cobbler; as well as all the other goodies on the Menu. I bring all my friends from out of town here. The serving staff is friendly, and stable (meaning that they've been there for years...). They all know me by name and are wonderful. Steve the owner always hangs out meeting his guests too. If looking for a very reasonably priced American (Texas/southern) Café, then this is the place. You will be delighted. Its been open over 25-years, same owner, and the quality is consistently superior. Its the treat I've given myself every week for over 15-years.

When the Lindstrom's owned it... it was all about attention to detail. This is my third and last attempt to use this car wash. I'm going to a wedding... need my car nice, so, I think, let's step up from the $5 place to a really good wash... WRONG...The arm-rests, dirty, seats dirty, dash dusty.... Not even an attempt to clean the inside. So, next time you want a GREAT WASH... look elsewhere, or do the inside yourself and save eight bucks! In one word, here's my review... NEXT!

Chris Bianco... A Master Chef... You will be delighted with all aspects of Pizzeria Bianco. I have been a customer for many years, and never written a review. But really, it is as good as it gets. ENJOY!!

I live in the Arcadia area... the big benefit, is lots of little neighborhood cafes and local businesses. Its a great friendly area.... except at the Acacia Cafe... , and I'll get to that part of the story in a minute. Now most Saturday mornings, I plop myself down at a local café and read my Wall Street Journal, but today was just a bit different. My good friend Kevin, who drives a tour bus on the weekends, called and said, "I'll pick you up in the big bus, I've got just a 30 minute break for breakfast." Upon arrival, we walked into the Acacia Café, where we have been countless times before, and this time the lady behind the counter actually shouted at us: "NEVER AGAIN!!... YOU PEOPLE DO THIS ALL THE TIME..."  I'm wondering what aren't we doing again, and which "You People" am I or are we?  Well she continues to scowl and loudly gripe about the fact that my friend called in his order in advance. Well, if you don't want the order, just say so..   After we were served, and sitting at our table, my friend Kevin commented, "Well, I guess we've just been spanked for being customers." If our server's desire was to leave me/us with a very distasteful view of the Acacia Café, 'cause I'm now one of "THOSE PEOPLE", I would say she was quite successful. There are many other small eateries in Arcadia, and I'll be eating there and reading my Wall Street Journal at their venues in the future, I believe the other cafes are happy to welcome me as one of "Their People".  Now the food at Acacia... Well actually pretty tasty, but the unhappy distasteful atmosphere in the Acacia means count me out.

SAD NEWS. Chase no longer lets others put any amount of cash into another's account. That means, my business partner can't deposit to my account, nor can I deposit $100 to my step-daughters account if she needs some money. THIS IS A TERRIBLE POLICY. Speaking with the manager, this comes from the top. There is no work-arounds. Even with ID, only the account holder may deposit CASH to their account. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE from the TOP MANAGEMENT, I have only compliments for the local branch Manager.

Its ALL GOOD... The day before thanksgiving, I had a blow out in my Toyota. I took it to Camelback and Robert G. He did not have the tire in stock. But he sourced it, had it delivered to the dealership, and it was installed by 4:35PM, so I could be happily on my way to Flagstaff for Turkey Day. Also, I had no appointment. I was a walk-in. The price, $18 dollars LESS than what was quoted. This was a truly EXCEPIONAL SERVICE EXPERIENCE, and I heartily recommend the service department of Camelback Toyota. Robert G. went out of his way to get me on the road for the Holiday, and exceeded my expectations!!

We chose Spoke & Wheel for our company Christmas party... WOW... did they take good care of us. There are few places that have large banquet space available... space for up to 30.  The banquet room was fully decorated, and made formal with linen tablecloths and napkins, they even printed a custom menu for us.  Even with their most modest price point, the food and service was absolutely 5-STAR... Today is the day after the party, and my crew is still talking about how good the dinners tasted. Additionally, we had appetizers and dessert.  Our event was just about 3-hours and included a cocktail hour too.  When considering a restaurant, where a private room is necessary - and modest cost is a must; I would say look first at Spoke & Wheel... You'll be delighted with your choice.
