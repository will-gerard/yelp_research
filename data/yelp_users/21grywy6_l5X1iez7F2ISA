Everytime I eat here I get the best service. There are two ladies working that I think I have worked there for a while, they are so sweet and seem to know a lot of the customers.  She once told me "keep on smiling" it was so sweet, it made my day and I still think of it. They also have a drive thru! They need to be recognized for their great service, it is definitely rare in this area!!

This is a great concept but the service here is terrible. They must not have any customer service standards what so ever. Didn't even say "hi" or "welcome," just stared at me until I asked for help.I have so many clothes I would like to sell but I would never bring them here, I would totally recommend trying somewhere else.
