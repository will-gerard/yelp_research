This was our 2nd visit to The Rooste and I was not disappointed (for the 2nd time).  I look forward to seeing Horney on the way in and this time took the slide down to the table. We got there right after it opened on a Monday so we got in right away and didn't have to wait long for our meal either.   The magician guy was pretty fun and he totally still has me wondering how he switched the coin I was holding with the one he was holding without touching me. I even studied it after the trick and it really was the opposite coin. Crazy!  Our server was Kevin and he was really attentive and down to earth. I ordered the filet (got the same last time) and it was absolutely amazing. Very tender and flavorful. I didn't even use steak sauce which I normally do when eating steak.  I forget which cut my boyfriend got but he did enjoy his as well.  We got green beans and a corn on the cob on the side and we ordered a side of mashed taters which for the 1.79 it cost, was way larger than expected. Although the sides were kind of average, the steak itself is what made us come back for more.    At the end you get cotton candy! I love it! The ambiance of the place is really rustic and very country. There is a live band that plays there every night I'm guessing (they played both times we've been) and it was actually the same band as last time because I remembered the lead singer looking like Greg Brady, lol.    The attentiveness was different than the first time we came in (it was a Saturday night) so maybe it had to do with the place not being packed, but maybe not.  I suppose we'll find out next time!  We were seated right next to the window so we got a beautiful view of the valley. Awesome!  I would totally recommend this place to everyone to try at least once.

Sooooooo, this is the 2nd time we ordered from this particular Dominos. The first time we ordered, they screwed up our pizza, so when I called and spoke with the manager, she put a "free large 3 topping pizza" on the account for next time. Ok, fine.  We call tonight to order that free pizza and we added an order of wings to that for delivery. That was at 4:45pm...5:30 comes and goes, no pizza. Not a huge deal considering the game was on...6:15 comes and we finally call to see what happened.  This is the conversation I had with the person on the phone when I called:  Me: Hi, we ordered a pizza at 4:45 and we were wondering what happened to our order... (gave him order/address specifics)  Dominos: Well, there is no record of your order.  Me: You're kidding, right?!  Dominos: Nope.  Me: Well, I called an hour and a half ago and the guy on the phone took the order and actually confirmed it with me.... (I got interrupted...)  Dominos: Well, I'm the manager and I've been here ALL DAY and there is no order for you. (I'd like to add that he had the most ridiculous attitude towards me)  Me: Wow, you're the manager and you speak to customers like that?!  Dominos: Yeah.  I asked him his first and last name and I would have preferred screaming obscenities at him, but I just hung up and went to Barros which is basically 80000% better anyway.  We just wanted to use the free pizza we were "given" because they effed our order up the first time.   Shoulda learned the first time, huh?  I will NEVVVVVVVVVER go back here, and I'd suggest that anybody that appreciates to be treated the way a customer deserves to be treated doesn't either.

We had just gotten effed over by Dominos, which wasn't where we wanted to go anyway (but we had a free pizza, see my Dominos review), so we went to Barro's.   We went in there and the super friendly girl at the counter tells us it's only going to be about 15 mins max for the order of wings and the pizza we placed. Awesome.  We went across the street to get a Redbox movie while we were waiting.  Go back in and it was packed (we somehow had missed the crowd) and the girl remembers us and gets our order for us and we were out the door in 15 mins flat.  We had ordered a large pineapple & pepperoni pizza and a 12pc order of medium wings.  Everything was delicious! I'm actually very glad that Dominos sucks-a$$ because we went here instead.  I know exactly where I'll be going for pizza next time.   I wanted to take pics, but we were so famished we mowed through the wings and half of the pizza before I realized I should have taken pics. Ooops! Sorry. Next time for sure!  Nom nom nom.

My boyfriend and I got a Groupon for Miele's and decided to use it last Friday night on a whim.  The restaurant is in a strip mall kinda place, but it actually happened to be convenient so I could go next door after dinner and get a couple of groceries.  :)  The restaurant itself is quaint but nice. It's got a fancy feel to it, but you can walk in with jeans and not feel under dressed at all. When we got there, all of the tables inside were occupied, so we decided to sit out in front. I was hesitant at first because I thought we might be forgotten or maybe it would get cold, but neither of those things happened.  Our waiter was sooooooo nice and always very attentive. I don't remember his name, but on the bottom of the check it said Jareski.  Anyway, he was very friendly and always made sure we had drinks and were okay.  We ordered a side of garlic knots to try and then ordered our drinks and entrees.    About the garlic knots, they were okay. My favorite part of that was the marinara. I swear to you that marinara became my crack. I could have probably drank it from a mug for dinner, that's how good it was, hahha. I think the reason the garlic knots weren't my favorite was maybe because they weren't garlicy enough for me. They were a little bland.  The bread that comes to the table with the individual oil/vinegar plates was decent, but it would have been even better if it had been maybe a nice crusty loaf of bread. I used the marinara leftover from the knots instead of the oil/vinegar as I'm not so much of a fan (boyfriend is and said it was yummy.)  Not tooo long after we had finished the knots and some of the house bread, our entrees arrived. The waiter said each thing is hand made to order, so if people have a problem with waiting a few extra minutes for ultimate freshness, they need to work on patience.  Yeah it took longer than maybe Olive Garden, but Olive Garden has all of their stuff ready to go and to be plated and sent out.    I wanted a side of artichokes on my pasta and he wasn't certain if there would be a charge or not, so he went and checked. I wasn't concerned because I had the Groupon, but he did go and check and when the meals arrived, there were my artichokes. A very generous serving at that.   My boyfriend really enjoyed the Rosemary chicken, which came with spaghetti and marinara.  I got the penne Alfredo with chicken and had that side of artichokes- YUMMMMMMM.  The Alfredo sauce here is quite mild, but is still very flavorful. The pasta wasn't drenched in a thick goopy white sauce which Alfredo usually seems to be. It was almost delicate.  The chicken was very moist and there were not weird fatty/rubbery parts in it (which is my weird issue with ordering chicken or other meats in restaurants because I'm super picky about it).  He finished his entire entree and ate a few bites of mine and I decided to pack the rest of mine and the artichokes to go so we could enjoy a slice of the Spumoni cake. AHHH MAHHH GAHHH!!!  We seriously scarfed it down before I even realized I should have taken a picture. It was basically a slice of "Spumoni" ice cream in cake form with an almost orange-ish whipped cream on top and a graham cracker crust. It was as delicious as appetizing looking.  Next time we come I think I want to get something with that yummmmy marinara and maybe try the garlic cheese bread as an appetizer instead. Of course we will be getting the Spumoni cake again, that's a sure thing.  To sum up my entire evening at Miele's would be: Had a really great meal with a really great server and we most certainly will be back again!!!

I bought a Groupon for The Urban Tea Loft because I always like trying something new and it was a good deal.  My boyfriend and I decided to go in for brunch last Saturday and really enjoyed ourselves.  The atmosphere is very relaxing with soft music and the decor is kind of mod and vintage mixed together. We sat down and the waitress brought us menus to look over. I chose to try the pear (and another fruit I forget?) tea and it was really good.  I ordered the egg and cheese croissant and he ordered the urban skillet. It was sooooooo good. I took a bite of his and his was good too.  I had eyed the dessert case and there were so many cute yet delicious looking treats. If I hadn't been full, I would have probably split a couple with the boyfriend. Next time!  (I don't know if I just came on a good day, but the service was great.  It wasn't perhaps as fast as a chain restaurant, but I imagine it's because they're making everything fresh and there's not 12 guys back there on a line. The waitstaff was very attentive and helpful.)

Came in a couple of weeks ago with my cousin and we both really enjoyed what we had ordered. We came in during the "happy hour" and got 3 appetizers: Baba Ganoush, Tzatziki and Feta & Olives.  My fave was the feta and olives. I liked the Tzatziki but it was a little too minty for my taste.  If there was a way for the mint to be toned down a lot, it would be much better. The pita bread was very soft, fresh and warm. Very complimentary. I'd love to come back and try the Spanakopita, Mediterranean Garlic Shrimp and perhaps see if the Tzatziki could be less minty. Delish!

I found Mark through all of the amazing reviews on Yelp and I was certainly not disappointed! He took my little "pit bull jr." into a much better behaved young man. Mark was (still is!) very prompt with communication by text and/or email when I have had issues with my Yorkie/Silky, Guinness. Mark nicknamed Guinness "pit bull jr." as the very first meeting, Guinness felt he needed to show Mark "I am the man of this house!" As his mom, I certainly needed to be the pack leader and instill more confidence in my anxious little guy. Through our 5 in-home session, Guinness became more attentive and eager to please. Who knew?! I am very glad I chose the in-home in my case because I wanted Mark to see exactly what Guinness was doing and find specific solutions to these issues. From one week to next, Guinness was improving ten-fold and even Mark said he was impressed!  :)  Mark is very knowledgeable, intuitive and hilarious to boot. I am so happy I went to him for help, it has saved my sanity and keeps our house a lot more peaceful now!  Thank you, Mark! -Sarah, Mike & Guinness

Well, I can see why some others complained- both my cousin and I got our orders screwed up- however, the food was really yummy.  I had gotten a turkey wrap and cheddar broccoli soup and she got the Reuben The Great and a side of steamed veggies. I even snuck off to the salad bar and stole some pepperoncinis for my sandwich and nobody said anything.  The atmosphere was really open and airy and clean.  Even though they forgot her pickle spear (and she was reallllllly looking forward to it) and gave me chips instead of veggies, the food in and of itself was delicious and apparently they include "free" soft serve ice cream that we totally forgot existed unfortunately. I'll totally be back!

Boyfriend and I went to try Lobby's after seeing the phenomenal reviews.  He got the famous Italian beef sandwich hot with cheese and I got the little veggie sandwich and an order of the chili cheese fries. He got his in a combo that came with a side of fries and a drink. The owner was there and took our order and he was suuuuuuuper nice.  He was really excited for new people to try his food.    We went and grabbed a table and just as we sat down, a rush of people came in.  There must be a lot of regulars because he was greeting some by name. There must be something to this food for that many loyal customers.   Not too long after we got our drinks, the food was ready. I decided to immediately dive into the chili cheese fries. The cheese was like the melty nacho kind (not spicy though) and the chili was actually kind of sweet. I wasn't the biggest fan of the chili. My boyfriend did like it and he doesn't usually like chili. I'd probably just get cheese or plain fries next time.  The little veggie sandwich was so tasty! It was lettuce, tomato and pickles (I didn't want onions) with their house sauce on a sesame seed bun.  I'd love to try a burger next time.  The boyfriend did like his sandwich except he didn't know it was going to be "dipped".  He doesn't like his sandwiches dipped, so if he were to get that again, he would request it dry.  The sandwich was hearty (I added a pic) and very filling. He kept stealing my chili cheese fries so I take it he liked those too.   It was really bright and clean in there and the owner and the guy making the food were really cool.  I'd definitely come back. We both want to try the burgers next time. Although....the hot dog with all the stuff does look damn tasty too....

Sooo, my rating isn't really regarding the food. I've been twice- waited until after the 2nd time to Yelp to give them a fair chance but really wanted to share my experience to possibly save somebody else from the hassle.... Both times the food was pretty good.  The wings weren't amazing but they certainly weren't terrible either. My biggest beef is with the service. BOTH times we had suuuuuuuper slow servers. Both times they screwed up at least 2 times.  The first guy gave us the wrong order, I'm a good patron, I totally expect stuff happens and I usually give the benefit of the doubt. Well- he AGAIN brought the wrong thing. How does one manage to do that!?  We decided to give them another try since it's the closer BWW to us and we were totally craving wings. Well? It was way worse this time.  Food quality was the same- pretty good.  Service? Sucky.  It was really odd because there seemed to be an over abundance of employees scheduled this particular night and yet the service was super slow.  When the girl finally came to take our orders, I ordered a soft drink and my boyfriend ordered a beer.  So she comes back and does get my drink right, but brings him a completely different beer.  I try to flag her down as she leaves without even asking if we were good and tell her she's given us the wrong beer. "Oooops! I'll be back!" No lie- at least 5 mins later she finally shows up with the correct one.  The food arrived and this time there were no hiccups with the wings, so we were just trying to enjoy the meal. So again I had to flag her down for a refill on my beverage and again for the check since we wanted to catch a movie.  The check shows up and I always look to make sure things are ok (especially when I can tell the server is a ditz) and sure enough- she charged us for the incorrect beer AND the one he originally ordered and got eventually.  I flag her down again and tell her about it and she apologizes and says she'll fix it.  At this point, my boyfriend had given her the card to charge after she had fixed the tab. I warned him against it because the girl was dumb as rocks, but let the inevitable happen.  Minutes later she appears and says she's having trouble figuring out how to remove the charge and that she had charged the card before she changed the total. Awesome. So now the manager had to come and fix the whole mess and we were FINALLY on our way.  We both decided that we'd never come back to this particular location and try the Gilbert location off Gilbert.

Nom nom nom.  This place is such a wonderful nearby treat! We used to go to another nameless big froyo chain and decided to try this place out right after it opened. We haven't been back to said nameless chain froyo joint! We LOVE Yo Love! When it first opened it was just getting their name out there and the manager talked to us each time we came in to get opinions, etc.  Since then, the place has become extremely popular! There are usually at least 10 flavors to choose from, some are mainstays (double chocolate, double vanilla/etc) and there are often new flavors to try.  My boyfriend and I happen to be addicted to the double chocolate with him adding Butterfingers in his and me experimenting with different toppings here and there. Just tonight we went and sampled the cookies & cream- NOM. We both got that and it was amazing.  We like to come once a week, but have visited twice in a week before. If you want yummy high quality frozen yogurt with all sorts of fun and delicious toppings available, try Yo Love. You can even leave your own special "mark" on their board.  :)

My boyfriend and I came in for lunch the other day and while I realllly liked my sandwich, he thought his was just "okay".  I ordered an untoasted 6" turkey club and added mustard instead of mayo and a side of potato salad.  He ordered a footlong buffalo chicken sandwich. I *think* the reason he thought his sandwich was just "ok" is because the buffalo sauce isn't very spicy. I personally thought it was delicious. I wanted to try his sandwich to see what it tasted like, and I liked it better than he did! The turkey on my sandwich was fresh sliced off a deli slicer and they didn't skimp on the bacon whatsoever. The bread was really tasty too.  On his, the quality of the chicken was super good and to ME the buffalo sauce/flavoring on the sandwich was great. The potato salad was decent too. I'm unsure if there are special deals per days/etc but if not- I'd totally come in at least once a week!

I booked my wedding party and bridal make up and hair almost last minute and was assisted by Randy via phone and email. He was very pleasant and funny actually and made me feel less anxious about having to change MUA and Hair less than a month before my wedding. I then met with Chenda who is a wizard at makeup and hair and was ecstatic with how she took my hair idea and turned it into something amazing. The makeup- flawless.   On the day of my wedding, Chenda was right on time and ready to work and did my bridesmaid's hair, my flower girl's hair and my mom's hair and makeup. They looked lovely! Then it was my turn and my hair and makeup was even better than the trial. My hair stayed in place all night and my makeup again was flawless even by the end of the night (after ugly crying during the father-daughter dance). I am STILL getting compliments on my hair and makeup and would never hesitate Chenda and The Edge Salon for the awesome work! Thank you!!!
