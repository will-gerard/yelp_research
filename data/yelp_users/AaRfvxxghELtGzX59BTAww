My pom puppy was in desperate need of a good grooming because his puppy fluff and adult hair had turning into quite the tangle. I called on a Saturday afternoon figuring they would be booked as the last 5 places I called were. Terri, the owner, said she could squeeze us in if we could make it in within an hour! We only live about 5 minutes away so we headed over. The minute we walked in the door I felt like we found the perfect place. I had only been to the petsmart grooming and the Critter Corral had a very at home feeling, with ladies who were really guniune dog lovers doing the grooming. Terri way very nice and actually a pom owner herself so I felt like my baby was in good hands. I wanted to keep his hair long but I wanted him to be comfortable in the summer so I was considering a short cut, which i deep down didn't want to do for fear of damaging his coat, and Terri suggested that a short cut probably wouldn't be the best idea if since I loved his long hair, we agreed on keeping him long, but trimming him where necessary. We dropped him off and ran a few errands and he was ready in about 3 hours. He looks so cute!! So soft! and he smells wonderful. Terri did the best job getting his really bad undercoat tangles out, which will make it so much easier for me to keep up with the at home brushing. He even had a cute little bandana on when we went home; which I left on for the day because he looked so dang cute in it! The price was also beyond reasonable! Highly recommend the ladies of the Critter Corral to your fur babies, we will 100% be back for all of our future groomings! Thank you, Terri!

Please please please get this staff a second cash register! Have stopped in for lunch time and it is busy! The staff operates like a well oiled machine, friendly and efficient and then you get to the cash register and the machine explodes. One register is just not enough for the volume of people in line and call in orders. I legit felt bad for the staff on the register as I could see the pure stress on their faces dealing with the amount of orders, people standing everywhere, asking for their togo orders, eye rolling frustrated people in line.   I typically don't mind waiting but it got to the point I'm standing there just dreading how soggy my sandwich was going to be once I finally got it. Which it was. Every single staff member was so friendly despite the anxiety behind that counter. My sandwich was pretty great still despite being a bit soggy. A second register is necessary, please for the sake of non soggy sandwiches and your employees!

i needed an oil change but did not want to sit around at the dealer or go to a chop shop oil change place and came across Phoenix Bimmer here on yelp. They just so happened to be 5 minutes from home and looked to be the perfect place. I work 9-5 so I emailed the info address inquiring about pricing and avaliable times and Trinity promtly emailed me back with the price for the service and a day/time that worked with my schedule. I scheduled via email which was a huge plus for me as I am unable to make calls during the day and email is best for me. I arrived to my Saturday morning appointment, the shop was clean and comfortable, free wifi and a cute shop dog hanging out. The girl who was working was super friendly and I was in and out in about an hour. The price was exactly what she said it would be in the email, and they didnt try to sell me on things I did not need or try to tell me other things were wrong with the car. Fast! Friendly! Honest! I fould my go to BMW spot!  Thank you!!!

My boyfriend and I decided to have our weekly "cheat meal" at Humble Pie last Saturday night 3/15 after I had received a flyer for one free pizza at work. I had eaten at another location once before so I was looking forward to our dinner. We arrived Saturday night, hungry as can be, around 8 pm. There were many tables available both inside and out and we patiently waited for the hostess to arrive to seat us. It took her a minute to get to the front but that is understandable when there is only one hostess working; she greeted us and we asked to sit at an outside table. The patio was a good size and there were probably 3 other tables sat outside when we arrived. We excitedly looked over the menu, chatted about our day, picked out 2 appetizers and 2 pizzas and waited. the waitress that was taking care of the outside tables had been out about 3 times bringing food, checking on her existing tables, busing empty tables, but not once even glancing in our direction. She had more that enough chances to even extend an "I will be right with you guys!" but nothing. I had spent years myself in the service industry so customer service is HUGE with me, and I understand what its like to be "in the weeds" busy, but still, you have to acknowledge your table ASAP! I'm not fussy because I get it, but it got to the point where I actually said, did they forget about us? At this point, I decided whatever I'll just go out let someone know we need help. I politely approached the bar where the hostess was at this time, and said, excuse me...? No one has been over to help us yet. She stands there expressionless and says "ok." No urgency whatsoever. Luckily the bartender overheard and said he would be right out to help us. So back at the table the bartender apologizes that our waitress is very busy and he will get us started for her. In my head I'm rolling my eyes because she had plenty of chances to greet us, but what can you do, I'm not going to let it ruin our dinner. We go ahead and place our whole order with the bartender and he quickly has our drinks out and our order placed. The two appetizers came out right away, and were delicious! We had the cheesy bread and a pretzel.After they arrived we realized we didn't have silverware. So I again got up, went to the bar, and asked for silverware. Feel like I should get paid I've been working so much at this dinner! We also ordered a pepperoni pizza and the buffalo chicken pizza; both were awesome! So we finished up and we pretty satisfied with the quality of the food, our server came out to wrap things up and offered dessert on him to make up for our wait if we saved room; which we gladly accepted. We had the pizza cookie desert and it was so good! I would go back just for that! So after all was said and done, the food was good, the bartender saved the day with that desert, and we will probably visit Humble Pie again.

I visited Revive Bodyworks last week using an amazon local deal. I booked my appointment online and it was very easy and convenient. They called me to confirm however I was working an unable to answer my phone so they communicated with me via email to complete the booking of my appointment. Being able to do that all over email really worked great with my schedule. The location was easy to find, very clean, and the receptionist, Sarah, was very friendly. My therapist was Laura, she was very good, I like light pressure and not once did she apply too much. She was quiet, which I prefer, and overall I received a great massage. During check out I was not pressured into re-booking or signing up for a monthly plan. Massages are treat for me so a monthly plan is not something I can do and I appreciate that I wasn't pitched any kind of sale. I was given a card offering a special price for a second massage and I will definitely take advantage of that! I really liked that this office wasn't just a chain massage place trying to make a sale. I will most definitely return.

There is just something about this location. The service sucks. The product is fine but the employees just bring you down. I more frequently visit the location on McDonald and I guess I have just been spoiled by the friendly upbeat staff there. Friday 12/26 I was picking up a couple of bowls for breakfast and I came in and the staff was busy juicing and making bowls with a few customers waiting. I walk up, patiently waiting looking over the menu, I'm in a great mood and having a great morning so far until the gal with the shaved sides, who took my order walked up. She walked up and I said "hi!" She gave me a dirty look and rudely responded with what did you say? I said.. I just said hi.. She says, "oh I though you said something." Uh ya, I was saying hi. It was uncomfortable and it put me off right away. I then proceeded to inconvenience her by giving her my order, 2 bowls off the menu and one juice. I legit felt uncomfortable ordering from her she was so rude. She did not tell me my total I read it off the register myself and she took my money, gave me my change and turned around and walked away. No thank you, it'll be right out, not a smile, nothing. I almost said, you know what.. Forget it. I wanted to be done with her attitude and it really put a damper on me for a minute. Like how can she be so rude and the one taking the orders? I was waiting for my order and noticed a sign about the punch cards are remembered I had one. She never brought that up at the register and at this point I didn't want to talk to her again so I left punchless. Every time I've been here the employees have been less than friendly. Looks like I'll stick to the McDonald location.

I am SO grateful for Rachael and Az Mama Bear Pet Care!!! I could not imagine leaving my precious babies at a regular kennel or petsmart style boarding facility. I know my pets are in the best care with her. I like that they go to her home and are able to play all day. I imagine it is much more comfortable for my pets to be there instead of a scary kennel where they are caged all day. Her prices are better than what you would pay else where for 1000x better service. I also like that she will text you pictures of your babies and she is very easy to get a hold of via text. I dont know how I would ever go on vacation without her! Thank you Rachael! You are the best in the biz!!!

LOVE The Pita Cafe! We first stumbled upon this gem at their other location, we loved the food but it was a little too north for us, so we were beyond excited to see the location right on FLW and Scottsdale. We have had lunch a few times and the food is always amazing and we really like the family like service they provide. Most recently we were having dinner and my bf enjoyed his beef pita so much he decided to order a second one. The young man at the cashier had asked him if he tried the gyro and they talked for a minute about the two meats. When the beef pita came out the owner had put a bit of the gyro meat on the plate for my bf to try! Totally impressed by that gesture! and the gyro was A+ as well. We will pro continue to make the Pita Cafe a weekly spot! Thanks for everything!
