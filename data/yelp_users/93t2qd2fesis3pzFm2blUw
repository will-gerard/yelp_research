I absolutely love this location at Serranos. Their customer service is amazing. The layout of this restaurant is very unique and gives you many options of tables to sit at depending on how you feel. I am obsessed with the chips they deliver at the beginning of your meal. The chips come with salsa and bean dip which are to die for! Their margaritas are amazing and you can not come here without trying one! I have yet to try an item on the menu I do not like!

I absolutely love Krazy Sub! I continue to go to this location because it is closest to where I normally am, otherwise I would preferably go to the location on signal butte. The employees at this location are nice but not overly friendly. The location is not always super clean as you have to look at tables closely before choosing one. When I request my subs and salads to be made a certain way they are normally not as I requested and 1 or 2 things will be wrong.      I did however sign up for their text alerts and I will randomly receive a text telling me of specials they have going on. I always go in when I receive a text because they are such great deals!

Serranos is my favorite Mexican food restaurant. This specific location is my least favorite. I have been to this location several times hoping to give them another chance to redeem themselves and I always leave disappointed. The last time I was here they sat me in the bar area. I was with 2 young girls under the age of 14 and found this to be a bit unacceptable. The bartender was also our waitress and she took 15 min to order our drinks, another 10 min to order our food. By the time our food was delivered it was cold, myself and the 2 others I was with did not finish our meals. 25 min waiting for the waitress to ask for our check and I had to give up and ask the manager on duty so we could finally leave.      Again I love Serranos as a whole but I will not be going back to this specific location, after the 3rd and final try to give them a chance to show they can compare to the other locations I am finally giving up.

If you want quick, cheap and good Mexican food this is the place to go! Its very much like Filibertos. You have the option to buy a major item by itself (burrito, taco, etc) or you can choose one of their meal deals. They also have daily specials where you get a major item with extras for a discount! They offer and red and green sauce free of charge.     The restaurant is relatively clean and though it is small they have tables and booths to sit down and eat your meal. The only complaint I have is the first time I bought a burrito I didn't realize cheese wasn't included. So every time I go back I have to ask for cheese which is an additional cost. This place is nicely priced though so I will continue to come back here when I am craving me some Mexican food!

Out of all the Krazy Sub locations I have been to this is by far my favorite. The employees are very good at recording your requests and fulfilling your orders 100%. The employees are also very friendly and this location is always super clean.  I have yet to try a item on the menu that I do not like. Be sure to try their amazing salads, for around $5 you'll get such a big salad you'll have to save some for later!

Out of all the tanning salons I have ever had a  membership with in the 8 years since I have been tanning this salon is the worst. I decided to purchase their unlimited monthly level 1 package for $50. I received 2 weeks free with this purchase. After a month of tanning at this salon I was almost as pale as I was when I first started. Every other tanning salon I have been to in the past has either the same or cheaper pricing and I usually have to stop tanning before the month is up because I am so dark. Also their customer service compared to other salons is not even on the same level. Most days when I would walk in to tan the workers would continue with their personal conversations for minutes before they acknowledged me waiting.  I would always have to repeat myself because they would ask the same questions multiple times before finally listening.  It was very uncomfortable some days because the workers would try to sell and upgrade me. They would go into long sales pitches before letting me start my tanning session. If they would have just looked at their screen and saw the package I had bought it would have saved us both some embarrassment.     However I do want to come of as all negative, aside from the workers at the salon the atmosphere is quite relaxing. The lighting is darkened and they sometimes have music playing through loud speakers. The rooms to tan in are nicely sized and were always very clean. They do provide tanning glasses so you do not have to bring your own. I was impressed with the size of the beds, and the fans in the beds kept me quite cool at all times.
