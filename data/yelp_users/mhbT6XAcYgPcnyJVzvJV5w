Cold fries and best of all, a customer came in and ordered. The table he wanted had some kind of white creamy junk on it. He went and told someone and they handed him a rag. Lol

Just tried to have breakfast there, had to wait a few to be seated, that was no problem. After being seated, it took 7 minutes to get our water after the hostess noticed we had not been waited on. After someone bringing our water to us, we waited 10 more minutes without service or acknowledgement we were there, we left. Other parties were seated after us we're being waited on and orders taken.

They did a great job moving us into our new home. Very friendly and polite workers. They were able to answer any of our questions and didn't leave until we were completely satisfied. Great job Brian and Mark. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone.
