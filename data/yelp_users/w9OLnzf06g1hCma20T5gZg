Just finished my first class here and I was pleasantly surprised! I was nervous about trying a different studio (I normally practice at Bikram Yoga Institute but I bought the Groupon for BYP), but I was totally comfortable and felt that the class was not only really similar, but the room smelled a lot better!  Julie was my instructor today and she was sweet and helpful and made sure I was okay since I was a new student here. I had a great class and am looking forward to my month-long package!

Finally! These past few months I have been going to a different nail salon every 2 weeks looking for the right atmosphere, quick and friendly service and most of all, acrylic nails that DON'T LIFT! I have found my new place and it is such a relief. My nails are over a week old and are still beautiful, which is a huge deal for me since every other place I've gone have given me sloppy, uneven nails that lift off in about a week.

I've been coming here since I got my braces on 15 years ago and have recommended it to many people. The staff is so friendly and the dental hygienists do a great job. I've had all sorts of dental work here and they have made every experience a positive one. They listen and answer all questions I may have and they make sure that I am comfortable throughout the appointment. As long as I am in Phoenix, I will always come here for my dental work.

This place has a special spot in my heart (my boyfriend and I had our first date here). We usually start the dinner waiting at the bar with a bottle of wine. The bartenders know their stuff! They always recommend an awesome wine. When we get a table, we know what we want immediately. My favorite pizza is La Noce. Ricotta, tomato sauce, walnuts and we add proscuitto: it is to die for. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the last two times we've gone, our server was less than attentive. After waiting 35 minutes and drinking almost a bottle of wine, we want to order! I love this place, amazing food, gorgeous patio and friendly bar staff.

I took my two babies here and it was awesome. They're not fans of bathing, but the deep tubs and the hoses made everything so much easier. They provide you with an apron, brushes and all the different kinds of soaps. The only complaint I have is the price. With the de-shedding option, I ended up spending $20 a piece on the dogs and an extra $10 each for their nails to be clipped. Walking out spending $60 to wash my own dogs is kind of crazy to me. But it was fun and the doggy bakery was really cute. I'd probably come back, just not every time my girls need a bath.

Tried this place once because of their good reputation, but I don't think I'll be coming back. We came in for dinner and were not greeted by a hostess. I have worked in the restaurant industry before and I am totally fine if they are slammed and they can't get to you as soon as you walk in the door. No big deal. But then, after a full few minutes, I started to get annoyed. I asked a server if we could be seated and they pointed us in the direction of an empty table. We sat down with the menus I grabbed from the hostess stand and looked it over. It was different... I'm willing to try new things, but nothing really stood out to me. I picked a drink off the cocktail list and waited... and waited... and waited for a server to bring water or say hello or anything. Since nothing on the menu really grabbed me, my boyfriend and I decided to leave. I don't even think anyone noticed.

Love Postino! Been going to the Arcadia location for years and now that I'm down town, this is my new spot. Just as good as the original. Of course my favorite time to go is Monday and Tuesday nights for the $20 bottle of wine and bruschetta deal. Brie and apples with fig jam, ricotta dates and pistachios and the warm artichoke are my absolute favorites. I'm not much of a bread person, but their fresh local bread is phenomenal. Will always be a loyal customer of this place!

DO NOT RENT HERE! I've been here for about 9 months and I'm currently taking steps towards breaking my lease. I have dealt with smelly hallways, noisy neighbors, leaking ceilings and barking dogs... all of that I can deal with for the cheap rent and the great location. But the one thing I refuse to deal with is the INFESTATION of cockroaches. I'm talking multiple times a day. I've had the complex exterminate 4 times, I've used an outside service and even Raid Maxx Bug Barrier. Nothing helps. Not even a little. I was lucky enough to be woken up to a COCKROACH CRAWLING ON MY FACE. It's like being in my own personal horror movie. I am a clean and hygienic person and there is no reason for me to have that kind of pest problem.  After a few horrific experiences (including the bug on my face, the one crawling over my feet in the shower, and finding about twenty of them underneath my toaster oven) I spoke to the ladies in the office. They insinuated that I was being dramatic by saying that no one in the building has had complaints. What difference should that make?!  I promise you, there will be problems with your apartment here. I thought it would be worth the cheap rent, but I am glad to spend another hundred dollars a month in rent to avoid coming home to a cockroach infested, urine-smelling, loud, disgusting personal hell every day.

I came across this place like many of the others here, on Groupon. I decided to check it out since it's close by and seemed like a cool place. Amy cut and styled my hair and did a fantastic job! I was given a cold drink, an awesome scalp massage and friendly conversation while getting my cut. I loved this place and will return!

This place is beautiful! I came here when they opened for my first waxing experience (probably the most terrifying grooming experience for most women) and my girl Nicole made me feel about as comfortable as humanly possible in that situation. The receptionist staff is wonderful, welcoming and helpful. I highly recommend booking with the lovely Nicole, especially if you're a little nervous.

I've been here for drinks a couple times and it was fine. Cheap drinks, mellow atmosphere and not too noisy. However the last time we went (a group of 8), our server seemed to not care whatsoever. Two of us came late and everyone had received their drinks before, but the server took forever to come back and ask if we wanted anything. We decided to try the food, some variations of grilled cheese sandwiches and bacon fries, and after what seemed to be 20 minutes, some of us received our food- cold, with hard cheese. A few people in our group hadn't gotten their food until the others had almost finished (they insisted we start without them). When they finally got their food, it was also cold, but decided not to send it back just so we could leave. After all that, I will probably only go there for drinks from now on.

I tried this place out for the first time a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised! We live near the down town area and needed a good sushi place close by, so we found this one. It's small and not too easy to spot, but I was glad we found it. Inside was small, we were seated inches away from another couple right in front of the sushi bar, so it was a little distracting hearing everyone's conversations in our ears. Our server was from Japan and was very attentive and sweet. We tried a few rolls and some ngiri and we were surprised to see that the rice was purple! It was not only beautiful, it was delicious! The server explained that they use this special rice that is black before it cooks and it used to be only served to royals. This place was great and I will definitely come back.

This is my new favorite place! Great space, great books and a great bar! There really is nothing better than grabbing a drink and perusing the bookshelves. They offered beer, wine and a small selection of snacks (the southwestern hummus was fantastic) and there's plenty of space to hang out. They also had a great little reading spot for the kids equipped with puppets and fun books. Loved hanging out here and will be back often!
