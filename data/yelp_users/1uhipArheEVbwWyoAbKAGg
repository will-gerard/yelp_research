Went in for lunch the other day and had the Mongolian Beef, House Chow Mein and Boiled Won Ton. All of them were very good and the service was ridiculously quick with refills, etc. Would like to go back and try some of the other dishes.

My 300th review!  I had been to Cherryblossom a few times many years ago and enjoyed it but it was never really in my path so I hadn't gone back. Today I got the chance to go again and it was as good if not better than I remember. I have been trying to take it easy on carbs so noodles aren't generally the smartest idea. I also tend to go for Asian noodles when I'm out since I'm so picky about Italian anyplace but home. I saw on the menu that they offered low-carb tofu noodles and got it with the chicken parmesan. Also tasted some of the ramen and had some calamari. Everything was excellent including our server and it really hit the spot after going a while without any kind of pasta/noodle. I think I'll start making them a more regular stop.

Had a failed emission test that indicated the catalytic converter was hosed. Turns out the car has two and both were hosed. Called a ton of shops trying to find someone who wasn't going to charge a fortune and could do the job. After speaking to Alexander and getting not only a cheaper quote than anywhere else, but a ton of helpful information, I decided to take the car to them. Not only did they get the job done when promised for the amount promised, they explained everything going on with the car related to the repair and what had been done to it by the prior owner. Very happy with their work and I will keep them in mind for any future repairs. Check this place out if you need work done on your car.

I've been going to various Discount Tire's for 20+ years. I've always been happy with their service and prices. Went to this location because one of my tire's was losing air. I understand having to wait when going to any repair place/tire shop and I'm fine with it. What bothered me was watching people come in after me, wait, and then get on their way while my car didn't even get checked out. A couple people you can understand or figure they had an appointment. After about a half dozen, you have to wonder how you got knocked so far down the queue. The place wasn't even that busy but it took over 90 minutes to get my tire checked. Maybe it was just an off day.

Was driving around looking for a quick bite and found this place, decided to give it a shot. Ordered a beef brisket sandwich to go and it was pretty good. Definitely smelled incredible and I wouldn't mind trying some of their other dishes.

Been doing a lot of work on a cheap beater and calling around to various shops to see who's the least expensive for each repair. Took the car into this location for some work and they had the car finished when promised for the price they promised. They also didn't try to upsell on anything and were honest about which repairs were important and what could be blown off for awhile. Very happy with the work they've done so far.

Let me start by saying my car was dirty, but it was normal dirt from after a rain and the inside had some minor leaf debris from getting in and out of it. Not really filthy, but dirty at best. That said, when I got my car back, I hopped in and took off without really examining it because I was in a hurry to get home, totally my fault. As I was driving home I realized there was still bird poop all over my windshield and my dashboard looked like it hadn't been touched. When I got home and actually looked at my car, there was smeared bird poop on the roof and bug splatter still on the front of the car. They also appeared to have completely ignored vacuuming anything but the floormats. I'd give them one star instead of two, but the reality is that most car washes do about an equally bad job.

Went in for a few sushi rolls and some seaweed salad. The seaweed salad wasn't bad but there were a few pieces that looked like they were on their way to being spoiled/old. Only a few though, so we basically picked them out and set them aside. The sushi that we ordered was mostly just OK. The ingredients seemed fine but nothing was particularly good. Sushi is one of those things where a bad experience could be because of what you ordered though so maybe there are better rolls to get and we just chose poorly. Not sure if I'll hit them up again, but maybe I will to give them another chance since there are mostly good reviews. Our server was very nice, helpful and kept on top of everything.

Went in for lunch and got the double gyro plate. The pita, meat and sauce was really good and the fries were pretty decent as well. I would definitely go back here. They also got the food out quickly.

Meant to make pizza last night but my dough didn't rise in time so decided to order one instead and this was the only place I could find that was open. Put in an online order for a couple pizzas and cheesy bread. It arrived pretty quick which was nice, but the only thing that wasn't awful was the cheesy bread. The pizzas were both extremely thin, greasy and worse than a $5 frozen pizza. Lesson learned.

No one likes having to go to a hospital but my experience here was a good one. Was told to get to an ER because I was having a heart attack(I wasn't) and they immediately took me back and started running tests. The nurses/techs/doctors were all very attentive and nice and the two days I was there was as pleasant as they could be. After I went home, they called to make sure I was ok and to set up appointments for me so I could get continued care. My nurse for the last day, Lauren, was particularly good in helping with everything and getting me discharged as quickly as possible.

When I initially went here I ordered a normal pizza and while it was pretty good, it didn't really elicit a return visit. My work has used Venezia's several times and it was always way better than the pizza I ordered for myself, the only difference being the size. They always order the 24" party pizzas. So I did the same and for whatever reason, the bigger pizzas are way better. Since then I've ordered several times and the pizza is always really good. So my suggestion is to go here, get the 24" pizza and have pizza for 3 days straight for every meal.

Overheard some coworkers talking about this place and they said it was really good. Reading the reviews, I was less confident in eating here but decided to do it anyway. Ordered a ton of food. Beef skewers, egg flower soup, orange chicken, pot stickers, low mein, fried rice and egg foo young. I didn't try everything yet, but the beef skewers and egg foo young were both excellent. Everything else I tried was really good. They also had everything ready quickly and for as much food as I ordered, it wasn't that expensive. Definitely will be going here again.

There was a Mongolian BBQ place I went to for 20 years and apparently they went out of business. So I've been looking for someplace new to replace it and saw this one while driving around and thought I would check it out. Overall, everything was pretty good. They have a nice selection of veggies, noodles, meat and sauces to choose from. I didn't try any of the soups but my bowl was pretty good. I'm sure I will be back again now that I understand the process a little better and have tried the food.

My family has been using Arrow for many, many years and all of them love it. I've never had the need until recently when my new apartment demanded I declaw my cats. I called around to several places that were closer to home and then I tried Arrow. Arrow was much less expensive than anyone else and they were able to get me in for an appointment just a couple days later. I took the cats in and they carefully examined them and were very gentle in their handling of them. They explained the procedure, the cost, the recovery and billing and told me I could call anytime to check on them or with any questions I had after.   I can't say I was happy having to declaw my cats, it was a pretty horrible experience, maybe more for me than them since they don't seem to care at all now that they're healed up but I am very happy with how Arrow took care of them. Whenever I called after with questions, they were always very patient and understanding and if the person I spoke to didn't have an answer, they went and got one. Definitely take your pets here if you need a vet, their service was excellent in every way.

I have eaten here dozens of times. Only once was the food ever bad and they made it right in a hurry. Service is always excellent and this is really the only place I go for Italian food. I've eaten at a few of the other locations but this one is my favorite. I generally don't review big chains, but I'm happy to make an exception for Carrabbas.

Went in today and had a combo platter with fries and corn. The waitress was very friendly and helpful with the menu and the food came out pretty quickly. Everything was really good and the combo platter was a nice way to try a bunch of things all at once. I only made it through about half of it before needing a to-go box. I will be back if I'm in the neighborhood.

I've been here probably three times over the course of several years. Each time I've gotten something different and it's been hit or miss in terms of how I've liked it. The last time was a week or so ago. Ordered a chicken dish which I don't see on the online menu. It was three stuffed chicken breasts and was a bit over $20 with no sides. Then we ordered pasta with marinara for an additional $9 or so and garlic bread for another $8ish. For the amount of food you get, the prices are a bit high. The chicken was really good, the pasta and garlic bread were very so-so. Not much different than I would expect at an Olive Garden or the like. Service was excellent and our waitress was very nice and helpful.

I haven't been there in quite a while but I usually get their BLT salad and double black diamond martini. Both are excellent. I honestly can't remember much else about the menu and it's been a couple years since I've been. Probably have to correct that oversight.

Went there the other night and have the steak Diane, an Asian pear martini and some kind of sweet corn cake appetizer. There food and service is usually very good and their menu covers pretty much any taste. There's no need to mention the cheese cake, it's excellent.

I've only been here once but I really want to go back. Sadly it's a bit of a hike for me.   I got the Betty Boop and the Stupid Fries. Both were excellent. Be warned that the Stupid Fries look horrible, but they taste amazing so order them and dig in. The drinks are served in mason jars and the whole place feels and looks like you're in someone's home having a great meal.   Hopefully I can go back soon because it was absolutely worth the drive.  Update: Went back and they've remodeled. Food was still amazing and now the restaurant is also pretty great looking. Can't wait to go back again.

Been going to this location for many years, since before the move and I've always had friendly service. Went in yesterday just to look around and noticed they have a repair area now. I talked to Edward for a bit and decided to bring in my guitar that was set up horribly by someone else. After a quick trip home I brought my guitar in and while I waited I ended up buying a new bass and amp (impulse buy). Got the call today that my guitar was ready and as promised, Edward fixed the issues I had and got the guitar set up properly and made some repairs. Very happy with the work done (and my new gear).

I love gyros and this is my favorite place to get them. I have yet to find anyplace that even comes close when it comes to quality and quantity, especially for the price. The people who work there are very friendly and chat me up like they recognize me regardless of whether or not they really do. They always get my order right and they have me in and out very quickly. I go here every chance I get, even if it means travelling across town since I live on the extreme west side.

Was across the street getting my tire fixed and saw this place. Being a sucker for Italian delis, I decided to head over and see what they had. The menu is pretty decent sized to the point where I wasn't sure what I was going to have until I was at the front of the line. They also appear to be doing a pretty hopping business judging by the line at both the bakery and the hot food section. I ended up ordering the "Hot beef in juices" which is basically an Italian beef sandwich minus peppers and onions. It was pretty good though I wasn't in love with the roll it was on, but otherwise no complaints. I plan on going back and exploring the menu more since there is a ton of items on it that I'd love to try.

My tire pressure monitor went off on my way home from work so I figured I had a nail or something. Went in to this location to see about getting it checked out and they were packed to the point where there almost wasn't anyplace to park. They told me it'd be 90 minutes or so to get my tires checked and rotated. They made their estimate within just a couple minutes and had me on my way with no charge. Definitely will come back to this location.

Ordered a cheesesteak sandwich with fries for pickup. There was a glitch in the online ordering process so I had to wait for a bit for my food, but the bartender was very nice and did everything she could to make my wait comfortable.   Food was good too; I would definitely order from here again and in spite of them starting my order when I got there, they were very fast getting me out the door.

Went in because I heard this place had really good pizza. Ordered some cheese bread and meatballs as an appetizer and a large Sicilian pizza. Everything was outstanding including the server who was on top of clearing away garbage/plates and keeping the glasses filled. She also answered a bunch of questions about the menu and explained everything before putting in the order. I absolutely will be back here.

I was waiting to write this review after I moved out and received my final bill so I could see if there was anything worth mentioning in their after move-out billing.   First, I hate to use the term "bait and switch", but that's what it felt like. When I initially viewed the property I was shown a very nice model. It seemed pretty well kept and the layout was decent. When I asked to see the actual apartment I would be living in after making the deposits, the answer was always "no, it's not ready". As the move-in date got closer, I kept asking, even offering to see it dirty because I wanted some idea of what the place actually looked like and the answer stayed the same. I wasn't allowed to view the actual apartment I rented until the day I got the keys. That should have been a huge red flag and I should have probably reconsidered moving there, but I hadn't had any luck with any other apartments and I wasn't familiar enough with the area to know where to look.   When I finally saw the apartment, I felt like I had been had. The paint was sloppy. There was paint on the floors, baseboards, towel racks, and other surfaces it shouldn't have been. Whoever painted it just didn't care and ran through the job as quickly as possible. There were huge swaths in the bathrooms where it was obvious they didn't even actually paint. The doorframe in the master bath is crooked enough to look like a funhouse doorway. Same with the bathroom fixtures and cabinets. It looks like they were trying to upgrade the place and used the cheapest materials they could and just slapped them in without caring how it looked.   The windows and doors are all poorly seated/sealed so there are gaps that your heat/AC is going to flood out of. When Windexing the windows, the panes of glass literally pop right out and feel as thin as paper plates. I'm amazed none of them broke while I was cleaning. The ceiling in the hallway is acoustic ceiling tiles like you would see in an office building, assumably so they can access the heating/cooling but it looks cheap and tacky. There is also no pantry in or near the kitchen so unless you have a stand-alone shelf, you're going to be using your kitchen cabinets to store your food.   My first thought upon moving in was that I couldn't wait for my year to be up so I could move out. I never even unpacked a lot of my stuff because I didn't want to bother when I knew I wasn't going to stay long term.   Opening a maintenance ticket is a crapshoot. Sometimes they show up, sometimes they don't. If they are coming, they don't tell you so unless you're waiting around for them to come you're either going to be woken up or you're going to miss them entirely. Saying that, the maintenance guys were all very nice and quick to get in and out once they showed up so I'm not sure who's at fault for the poor scheduling.   The front office personnel were also all nice and I never had any issues with any of them.   The pros: During the year I lived there, I never saw any bugs inside or outside of the apartment other than the little gnats you occasionally see flying around. Whoever they were using for pest control did a great job. Also, the location is pretty good if you want to be in Tempe and near shopping and food.   As for the move-out billing, overall it was fair. My one gripe is that they charged me for a couple of broken blinds that broke while I lived there and that I opened a maintenance request to have fixed. Basically the little piece of blind that hangs from the clip snapped off. Not really something a person would do, just a normal break for cheap vertical blinds. Nonetheless, they never showed to fix it and they charged me $20 to repair them after the fact. I don't care enough about $20 to fight them on it, but I thought that was a little shady.   In the recent paperwork from Park View that they tape to the door or stick in the mail room, they've taken to referring to them as "luxury apartments". They're not. They're not even close. Luxury apartments have ceiling fans, upgraded appliances, 9ft or vaulted ceilings, decent fixtures and amenities. Park View is a very basic, normal apartment for a bit more than you'd pay elsewhere because it's in Tempe. Anywhere else the rent would be $200-$300 cheaper. And they will raise your rent if you decide to renew your lease which is like adding insult to injury.   Lastly, their pet policy is pretty bad. They allow cats and dogs which is nice but they demand you declaw your cat. My problem with this, besides the obvious, is that dogs have claws as well and tend to dig/scratch at doors. A dog's claw is going to cause a lot more damage than a cat will especially when you consider that while some cats do claw doors, they mostly stick to scratching your furniture which would leave no damage for the apartment itself. It's pretty barbaric to force a declaw on only some animals while allowing others to have their claws.   Sorry for the long review.

I haven't eaten here in quite a while so hopefully not much has changed, but this was my favorite place to get take out. The beef skewers, house fried rice, house low mein and several other dishes are simply amazing, especially when the outside looks very much like a hole in the wall. The only thing stopping me from eating here more often is the fact that it's so far away from my house. We always ordered a ton of food for pick up and were never disappointed. Hopefully I can make my way back soon because I haven't found any place that compares.

Went in for an early dinner. Had the calamari and chicken Parmesan. The calamari was cooked perfectly. The pasta that came with the chicken Parmesan was ok but the chicken Parmesan itself was very good. The service staff was phenomenal. Definitely worth checking out.

Stopped in last Friday for the lunch buffet. I'm not very familiar with Indian food though I've always wanted to try it and this place had a good Yelp rating so that's how we ended up there. The food was very good, once I determined what everything was and tried several small portions. The servers were quick to refill our water (we had a large party) and the restaurant seemed very clean.

I've been to 3 or 4 Blueberry Hill restaurants in Vegas and all of them are really good. Even the ones that look like they're run down holes still serve up great food. You would think that anything more than eggs, pancakes or a burger would be a bad choice but I've ordered a bunch of different things and they've all been better than expected. It's one of my safe, go-to places to eat when I'm in Vegas.

Years ago I went to try this place because it was supposed to be the absolute best pizza you could get, but when I showed up, there was a line out the door and I didn't feel like standing outside and waiting and I never attempted it again.   Cut to today around lunchtime and I happened to be in the area and it was open, no lines. Decided to go in and try this amazing pizza. Talk about being underwhelmed. The pizza is expensive and frankly, it's just not very good. I would believe it's very fresh and the ingredients are good, but the end result is a very so-so pizza for too much money. We ordered a total of 5 pizzas, (which are all about 12" and 6 slices), a water, a Coke and 2 teas and the bill was $97 and change. For that kind of money,  I expect an amazing pizza.   The service was very good and they were fast and friendly, but otherwise there is no reason to go there. Of the three different pizzas I tried, none of them were exceptional in any way and no one at the table seemed to enjoy their food very much. Maybe I missed the train on this place by waiting so long, but I see no reason to go back.

My brother talked this place up and wanted to take us there. After eating there, I'm not really sure why. There was a bunch of us so we ordered several appetizers including the zucchini, mozzarella, and mushrooms. All of it was ok, but nothing worth talking about. He also insisted we try the Pitts-Burger, which we shared and was honestly not just underwhelming, it wasn't very good at all. I ordered myself a gyro, which shouldn't even be called a gyro since it's not actually gyro meat. And they shove fries in and on everything. I won't say it was horrible, because it wasn't, but it also wasn't good. I'd give it 1 star except the server was helpful and attentive and the restaurant wasn't dirty.

The pros: The price and the location.  The cons: The shower head is perfect, if you're under 5'6. If you're over 6' you're going to have to lean to get your hair wet and rinsing is going to take awhile. Also, you can hear every sneeze and fart from your neighbors and anyone walking up the hall. Vegas is rarely quiet and you should expect noise on a weekend, but you shouldn't be able to hear someone clearing their throat.

The only bad thing about the hotel is the beds. Which when you're primary use of a place is to sleep in it, is kind of bad. The rooms are beautiful, comfortable and well laid out. The shower is roomy, has great pressure and will burn your damn flesh off if you're not careful. There was also a really nice garden style tub that I didn't get the opportunity to use.   The beds on the other hand were very spongy and felt like they were going to tip over if you weren't laying directly in the middle. I've honestly never experienced anything like that. Also, they tacked on a $25 fee for some nonsense at the front desk that included internet. I wasn't thrilled with that. Other than that it was an enjoyable stay.  Update: Apparently they added several charges to my card that weren't supposed to go through and now getting them to remove them is becoming a hassle. Also the "resort fee" was explained as being $25 per room. What it really is is $25 per room, per day plus 12% tax on top of that. So besides the normal room cost, there is an additional $112 tacked on to the bill. This was the first and last time I will stay at the Mandalay Bay.  Update 2: A month later and the erroneous charges have still not been removed. I guess I need to get my bank involved now since Mandalay is running such a shoddy operation.

Went in and it was happy hour so ordered a mix of various appetizers and waited until they were done before ordering a pizza. I don't remember what everything was and their online menu doesn't seem to show it, but there were these chewy pieces of dough served with fresh basil, and tomato sauce, a rice ball stuffed with mozzarella and meatballs with crusty bread. All of it was outstanding. Not wanting to leave without trying a pizza, I ordered a margherita pizza and it was excellent. Check this place out, it's very good and services was fast and friendly.

Managed to score this place several times using Priceline and I've never been disappointed. Absolutely beautiful hotel and no casino downstairs so it's relatively quiet and you don't end up smelling like an ashtray by the time you reach your car. Every time I go to Vegas I hope to stay here though I'm not always so lucky.

I haven't been to Corleone's in almost a year, but I was thinking about sandwiches and remembered how much I liked Corleone's, so this review is a bit overdue.   First time I went I remember thinking "Cheez Whiz on a sandwich?" but I was told to try it before I complained and I did. I used that same spiel on my mom when I took her and she frowned at Cheez Whiz being on her sandwich. Needless to say, we were both wrong. The Philly Cheese Steak at Corleone's is amazing. They also have really good fries and that's pretty much the only two things I've ever eaten there in spite of having been there probably a dozen times. Even if you're apprehensive, go and give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

Went last night because it was the only thing open in the hotel. I ordered the prime rib French dip and fries. I also tasted the fried chicken. They were both outstanding. Honestly the fried chicken was some of the best I've ever had which shocked the hell out of me. The restaurant is laid out kind of strange in terms of tables and decor, but that's pretty unimportant in light of the food. It's also a little expensive when you consider a sandwich is running you $15 but none of us were disappointed in our food and that's what counts.

Had the Mongolian steak and some house Low-Mein. Everything is very bland and tasteless. Other than the color of the meat, it's hard to tell what you're eating and afterwards, well, let's just say it didn't sit very well. Won't be back.

Went here because I wanted to take my mom since I'd been to the one in San Diego and loved it. Got seated in about 20 minutes, which was pretty good considering how crowded they were and the fact that it was Black Friday. Our food came out pretty quickly and everything was good, though I will say that the location in San Diego was better. While the portions were really large for most places, they were much smaller than the SD location, though that's not a bad thing since there was no place to take leftovers for us and it feels a bit weird to eat a burger with a knife and fork because it's literally impossible to pick it up. Service was a bit slow, but not annoyingly so. I wouldn't be afraid to hit it up again the next time I'm in Vegas.

Can't believe I forgot to review this place. Went a few weeks ago for a birthday dinner. Ordered the sampler plate with beans and cheese potatoes. The potatoes were so-so, as was the corn bread but the meat and beans were both outstanding. The way the line to order food is set up, it's kind of problematic if you need refills or even to get out of your booth, but they're limited on space so I imagine there aren't too many ways to fix this. Would definitely go there again.

Been here a couple times, never by choice.   I can't really knock the service too badly as they don't seem any better or worse than any other chain on a busy night, but the food is just not very good. It's also pretty expensive for what you get. I always leave feeling like I would have been better off going somewhere else and either paying less for the same kind of food, or paying the same for way better food. I avoid this restaurant at all costs.

Basing this review on past experiences. The last time I went I was disappointed in the food, the service was still excellent.   I've eaten here several times and have had the calamari (so-so), the mesquite grilled steak skewers (amazing), truffled potato chips (very good), buffalo cheese pizza (incredible), calves liver (stupid good), caramelized brussel sprouts, yukon gold potato puree, banoffee, and pineapple upside cake with vanilla ice cream.   Basically everything there has been incredibly good. This is another place that I always hit up when I'm in Vegas and I'm hoping the last time I was there was just an off night because I would hate to find it's no longer worth stopping at.

I was recently looking for an apartment and came across Talus Ranch. They have really nice floor plans with good space and relatively cheap rent.   What turned me off and why I'm moving into a different complex:  Bugs. Touring the apartments you have to watch where you walk because the ground is littered with dead roaches. I also spotted some live spiders in the closets.   Fees. You pay a monthly fee for bug control, parking, and you can only have Direct TV, no Cox. And you HAVE to have Direct TV. They tack on $40 a month whether you want it or not. There were also other fees that I've forgotten.   I didn't live here so I can't comment on more than what I saw on a tour, but it was enough to turn me off and not want to live there.

My daughter ended up going into the ER yesterday and spent about 6 hours between the various rooms/testing areas. The nurses were all very friendly and helpful in answering questions and the doctor we spoke with, Dr Gardener(sp?), was very pleasant and took the time to discuss her results, treatment and options. Going to the ER always sucks, but our experience here was a good one.

Just moved to this side of town a couple months ago and was looking for a new place to get my hair cut. I'm pretty picky since a lot of stylists will treat a guy with long hair like they're a woman and you end up with a ridiculous hair cut. I went in to Ulta yesterday and spoke at length with a stylist there who was very helpful. She then set up an appointment for me to get my hair cut with a different stylist. I was very happy with hair cut itself and all of the information and advice they provided. I plan on using them from here on.

Ordered online and picked it up when it was scheduled to be ready. I normally go to the location on 16th St and this was my first time at the Mill location and wasn't disappointed. Some of the other reviews made me nervous but I would happily go here again.  Update: Been back a couple times and it seems like they're doing something different. Normally the meat and cheese are mixed together but the last couple times I've gone, the cheese is sitting at the bottom of the bread where it congeals into a mess and the meat is on top. It really makes the cheese over-powering and I find myself scraping it off.

I chipped the back of one of my front teeth this past weekend and based on the Yelp reviews decided to call Dr Levinson's office. I assumed I would need a crown because of the size of the chip and frankly, I'm terrified of going to the dentist.   His staff is extremely friendly and helpful and they did their best to make me feel comfortable. They also assisted me in finding a dental plan to make any work I need less expensive. Dr Levinson was very pleasant and gave me several options and his opinions for fixing my tooth. He didn't try to up-sell me on the repair and when he did the work, he kept taking the time to make sure the repair felt natural and that I wasn't in any discomfort.   I don't think anyone likes going to the dentist, but I wouldn't hesitate to go back here and I plan to do just that. It was probably the best experience I've ever had at a dentist office.

Went in and had their fried meatballs and pepperoni pizza. I really liked the pizza and the marinara they served with the meatballs was excellent. The meatballs themselves were ok. Would love to go back and try a calzone.

Reading the reviews, I feel like I got a lucky room. Though my party actually had three rooms and no one complained. The place looks like it was recently renovated and everything was relatively new. The beds were kind of meh, but most hotel beds are unless you're staying someplace nice. The water pressure was good and the staff was very helpful and friendly. The only thing I would knock them for is the shower head, which is pretty useless if you're over 5'5. I didn't bother with the free breakfast because really, that's never going to be a good idea and you'd have to be pretty desperate to want to deal with that.

I absolutely love this place. The sushi is pretty good, though I have places I prefer for sushi. But I have yet to find a place that serves better squid. I've gone there just for the Ika Kara Age. Their menu isn't huge but what they offer is good. It's also not a large place so you may have to wait to be seated depending on the day and time. I've been here at least a dozen times though and I'm never disappointed. Their seaweed salad and bento boxes are also very good.

Saw a guy holding a sign on the corner of Dysart and McDowell advertising a Gyro deal and realized I had never seen the place before. Went in the next day and was seated quickly with a menu. Looked it over casually, knowing I already wanted to get a gyro since it seems difficult to find a good one in this part of town. Noticed they had calamari as an appetizer and ordered that with a gyro.   The calamari was very good. A lot of places fry it to death and you end up with a chewy wad of batter. Theirs was excellent. The gyro was the 2nd best I've had in the valley, which is saying something considering how many I've tried and immediately forgotten. I will definitely be going back here again and it will likely be my go-to spot for gyros.

Went in and got a chicken chimichanga and the 2 beef taco combination. When I opened the boxes everything looked really good. Unfortunately the food didn't really taste like anything. The best part of the meal was the rice that came with the combination plate.

Went in this past weekend for a group dinner. Our server Marcus was excellent at keeping the table cleared, making recommendations and getting everything we asked for. The food was pretty good, though a couple misses here and there with the various things I tried. Overall it was really good and I was pleasantly surprised.

I've been there before but it was many years ago. Went again tonight and it was as good as I remember. I could take or leave the Shochu, it's not my thing but they have amazing ice tea. Also had shishito peppers, robata grilled scallops, crispy fried squid and the Tomahawk steak. All of it was amazing. I will be going back sooner rather than later. Our server was also extremely helpful and took great care of us.

I'm basing this on past experiences. The last time I went everything was horrid and I'm hoping it was a fluke.   This is the only restaurant I've ever had Miso soup and liked it. Their miso is red/brown and not the traditional dishwater white miso that's so awful. They also serve some of the best calamari you will find. It's tender and cooked perfectly. I've had sushi, teriyaki chicken, miso, calamari, beef negamaki and several other dishes here and all were excellent. It's become a staple for when I'm in Vegas. The service has also always been top notch and I'm typically there really late at night.   I'm planning on eating there again to see if the last visit was just an off night. I'm really hoping it was.

Ordered a cheesesteak with onions and Wiz and fries. Everything was pretty good. Would have been better if I wasn't an idiot who got lost on the way there and left my order sitting for so long but that's my fault, not theirs. I'm sure I will be back. Also, the large sandwich is huge, my coworker thought I ordered more than one.

Went in for lunch yesterday and ordered a Cabernet burger and fries and a creme brulee for dessert. The burger was outstanding, extremely juicy and flavorful. The fries were also outstanding. Creme brulee was pretty good, but in my opinion, they're hard to get wrong. Service was excellent, our waitress was quick on refilling out glasses and checking in to make sure everything was ok. The dining area is pretty cozy so if you're going during a rush hour, you may want to call ahead.

Went in there tonight to grab some sushi and seaweed salad. I've been to Tomo before but it had been years and now I know why I stayed away. The seaweed salad was a tiny bit of seaweed on top of a pile of lettuce. I've never had it served this way at any other restaurant. Usually when you get seaweed salad, it's pretty much all seaweed. The calamari was so heavy with batter that you couldn't taste the squid at all. It was like eating a tempura hushpuppy with a little squid in the middle.   After the appetizers, we waited a very long time before our server came back to actually take our order. By the time she returned, we debated just leaving but we put in an order for a caterpillar roll anyway.   It was also pretty bland and so heavy with panko or whatever they fried it in, that it was pretty much tasteless.   I'm used to waiting when going to a restaurant on a Friday night since every place is packed but our server literally hit up all of her tables repeatedly except ours. She would circumnavigate the restaurant almost like she was avoiding passing by our table. It must have been noticed since several others servers came by to check on us and we even had to request our bill from one of them.   I love eating out and I'm a pretty heavy tipper because my mom was a waitress for most of her life but this kind of service was just ridiculous. I will not be going back here.

I typically go to Lee Lee's Oriental Market for a lot of my Asian fare but this place is way closer and after spending some time wandering around the store, I found a lot of great stuff. I will definitely be coming back for the groceries I can't find at the chain stores.

I used to love this place. We would order a bunch of food and it was all excellent. Last handful of times though it's gone from not very good to actually being bad. I went tonight for the first time in a long time and ordered three dishes. After tasting them, two went directly into the garbage. Really was hoping for a good experience tonight but I don't think I will be back.  I'm giving two stars instead of one because the people there are very nice and the one dish tonight that was good was very good.

Was taken here for lunch on a weekend. The portions were really large for the price. The tables were sticky and the bathrooms were both pretty gross. The service was ok as they just bring you your food and you don't really need to see them again after that.   The fries were good, as was the chicken, though it was drowned in sauce that while tasting okay was so heavy that I found myself scraping it off to try and actually taste the chicken. My fault for not asking for the sauce on the side. I will probably try it again but it wasn't anything special overall.  Update: Went back and got the chicken without sauce. Much, much better. Though two people could easily share a 6 piece chicken basket. It's a lot of food. I would definitely go back when I'm in the mood for some chicken and fries.

I'm only basing this on the customer service aspect, I didn't get my hair/beard cut or trimmed. I went in looking for some beard balm or wax and dealt with a couple of nice women working the front counter. One of them was showing me the various products when a stylist noticed and also provided some help with picking something out. So all three of the people I interacted with very pleasant and helpful and tried to answer all my questions. Definitely a good place to go for information and hair/beard products.

Was looking for a place to get a good calzone. I had the cheese ravioli appetizer and a cheese calzone. Both were very good. I didn't get a chance to sample anything else on the menu but I hope to change that soon. The calzone alone is worth going back for. Service was also very good.

Moved in December of last year and waited before writing my review to see how living here was after a little time. So far I have not been disappointed. I looked in this area because it's close to my office and my commute takes less than 10 minutes now. Also the apartments are very nice and spacious and the tall ceilings and well-laid out floor plans make living here very comfortable.   I was concerned about noise since I have lived in houses for most of my adult life and was worried that I would hear everything my neighbors did and annoy them with everything I did but the reality is you rarely hear anything. There is an occasional bump, or the sound of water moving through pipes when someone is showering above you, but it's very minor and I've yet to hear a loud T V or stereo or anything that would be bothersome. Likewise I have never gotten any noise complaints for my TV or music and that's a big plus. Also the views are beautiful and the community is very clean. In the month and a half I've lived here I have seen less than a handful of bugs, even outside when walking around.   Unless something drastically changes, I would recommend Las Colinas and I hope that the prices don't fluctuate much when it's time to renew because I would like to continue to live here.

So much for my good review of Las Colinas. In the reviews that are hidden, a user named Chip mentioned move out costs being ridiculous. Well, a month after moving out I received the final bill from Las Colinas.   First, in 3 days I somehow managed to rack up a water bill that's more than half of what we paid for a whole month. Next there is the $425+ for carpet cleaning. Now I will cop to having left the place a bit dirty on move out in terms of the counters and restrooms because I didn't have time to clean it properly do to a very bad move. That said, I own a carpet scrubber and regularly maintained the carpets during my entire time living there. The only thing I can think of they could be complaining about would be the furniture indentations on the carpet. Otherwise, it was not stained when I left it. I made sure of that. They also list $85 in damages which includes dirty drip pans on the stove for $30 (those are some pricey drip pans) and water damage under the kitchen sink. Considering I never stored anything  that could have leaked under the kitchen sink, if there is water damage, it's from their stuff.   I did enjoy living at Las Colinas while I was there and the apartments are nice but between the hike in rent every year and the ridiculous final bill, I cannot recommend anyone bother unless you like getting hosed after you've moved out.

I would give the place 0 stars if I could. I've been going to this location for nearly a year and up until their recent raid "troubles", I was pretty satisfied with their work. Since the huge turnover of people working the towel area, they can't seem to get a car cleaned properly. In the last 2 weeks I've gone twice; once for a VIP wash, the 2nd time for an express. The VIP wash was a joke. After my car sat in the sun drying for almost an hour, they started wiping it down and it honestly looked like they were cleaning it with Vaseline. The car was covered in streaks and smears and the guy working on it tried to make it off like something was wrong with the car. The car is less than 3 months old and brand new cars don't generally have greasy finishes. Frustrated, I finally left with my dirty, streaky car.   Went back again a few days ago for the Express and while the wait wasn't as bad, my car didn't look any cleaner than when I went in. At this point, I won't bother going back there. There are better car washes in the Valley and the fact that Danny's was the closest to my apartment is no longer worth the hassle of paying for a crappy car wash.

Unfortunately my new apartment doesn't have washers and dryers so I had to find a laundromat. Yelp led me here and I've been very happy with it so far. There are a lot of machines, so even when it's busy you can usually find some open. There are TV's, vending machines and a sink to clean up if you need it. There is always an attendant on hand and they spend a lot of time keeping the place clean, tidy and putting the carts back so you can easily grab them. No one likes doing laundry at a laundromat but this place makes it as pain free as possible.

Kind of a repeat of what Sandra R said below. I tried going here at 7PM (they're allegedly open until 10pm tonight) and the place is closed. I guess I should have called before driving down there to see if they're really open. Not sure why a place would be closed so early on a Friday night but I won't make that mistake again.

Went for the first time the other day, during lunch time and got a Mighty Meaty pizza. Service was friendly and there wasn't a very long wait and the pizza was excellent. I think next time I'll try something a bit more basic because all the toppings kind of bury the cheese, crust and sauce flavor, but no complaints. It was also very good the next day when I heated up the leftovers in the toaster oven. I will definitely be back.

Was a member for about a year or so when I lived nearby. The gym was always very clean and well cared for. Generally if a piece of equipment was down, it wasn't down for very long. The staff was always helpful and attentive and I never had any negative experiences when going there. Sadly I moved away and need to find a new gym but if anyone is looking for a nice, comfortable gym with a ton of options, Mountainside fits the bill.

Went in today because of the Yelp reviews and wasn't disappointed.

I've only eaten here once but it's hard to imagine a better burger. Went in on a Friday night and was seated immediately. It was busy but not packed. Ordered the Kobe burger with tempura mushrooms and Asian slaw and it was absolutely amazing. Also got the six cheese scalloped potatoes and while it wasn't a huge portion, they were fantastic. For 2 burgers, a couple drinks, an appetizer and a side the bill was roughly $60.   I plan on going here again and soon.

Been here a couple of times and it's always been good. Really loved the meatball sub and the 5 cheese pizza. Ordered the Philly cheese steak and didn't care for it, but it was more a taste thing than anything wrong with it. Definitely check this place out if you're looking for good pizza and subs.

Don't let the outside of this place dissuade you from going in. The inside is very clean and nice and the booths and tables all look new (or newly remodeled). The atmosphere is very much like an old country kitchen.   Went in planning on having breakfast and ended up ordering lunch instead. The hot roast beef sandwich was insanely good. The bread was thick and they provide you with a knife but it cuts with a fork like it's made of cotton candy. The roast beef is very lean without a lot of funk in it and the gravy and fries were great.   Tasted the pancakes and they were out of this world good. Very happy to have chanced upon this place and I will happily go back.

Went there today because I wanted to try something new. The girl working the register looked like she checked out completely. I've worked food/clerk jobs and I get that it's about as much fun and being attacked by toddlers wielding coat hangers, but try and at least pretend you're being a professional.   The food was about as boring as you can get, which when you're talking about a teriyaki bowl, is saying something. The sushi (crunch roll) looked and tasted like it was made entirely from canned/jarred ingredients. Everything was bland and easily forgotten. The one saving grace is that it's relatively cheap. Unfortunately, it tastes that way too. Needless to say, I won't be going back and would have been better served going to a fast food place.

Went in today for lunch and ordered a medium meatball sandwich. The medium is huge, I can only imagine what the large must look like. I only made it through half and wrapped up the rest for later. The bread is really good and they do not skimp on the cheese. The meatballs are pretty good as well. I would definitely hit this place up again if I'm in the area.

Went there today because I'm trying to check out the eateries in my new neighborhood and it's hard to find a good sub. Ordered the giant club sub. Unfortunately I was running errands and it ended up sitting in the back seat of my car for well over an hour. Still, it was a great sub. Good bread, fresh meat that isn't slimy and questionable like at some places and lots of ingredients. I can't wait to try some of the other sandwiches on the menu.  Update: Also have tried the meatball sub and Philly cheese steak, both were excellent.

I have to laugh at the fact that someone below seemed irritated by the lack of 'healthy' choices. It's a place serving fried chicken. If you want healthy, you started off in the wrong place. Fast food is never healthy, not even when you're ordering a salad. Enough of my rant on common sense from the masses.   This place does a very few things and they do them all well. I have been here several times. The chicken, fries, toast and cole slaw are always good. Is it going to send you screaming out to tell all your friends? Probably not. But it's good and their menu is easy to order from. It's also better chicken than you will find at probably 90% of the normal fast food drive-throughs.   It's definitely a place I like hitting up when I can and I will continue to do so. I have yet to have anything there that was a turn off.

This location is the closest to my house and I've eaten here many times. The service is always great as is the food. Their minestrone soup is amazing and I never fail to order it. I've never even tasted one of their salads. Have also had the manager come to the table and chat on occasion as well as give us a complimentary copy of one of their cook books. I love non-chain restaurants but Carrabbas is one of the exceptions. I can't imagine ever getting tired of their food.

Years ago I used to love Carrabba's. Even though it's a chain it was actually pretty damn good and was my go-to spot for Italian. Then something changed with them and no matter which location I go to, I'm disappointed. Went into this one the other night for dinner and ordered the same thing I've always ordered. The bread and soup were both pretty bad, especially the soup (minestrone) which one upon a time was amazing. Now it's watery and has almost no flavor. It's basically a bean and cabbage water soup now. The entree wasn't bad though the portions have shrunk greatly. It was also seemingly impossible to get a clean glass. Our waitress was very nice and tried very hard to replace our consistently gross drinks with fresh ones but apparently it just wasn't happening. It's a shame that a place I once loved is now not even a consideration to me when choosing where to go to dinner.

I try to avoid doing big chains, but occasionally I make exceptions.   I've been to this location a few times and it's always been good. The burgers are a bit greasy but honestly, it's not like a bad greasy if that makes sense. The pot roast sandwich, burgers and custard are all really good. They're also fast and fresh, even when you're close to their closing time. It's a great spot for me to hit up late at night in a pinch.

Went in for a quick bite and got the egg drop soup, beef egg foo young and orange chicken. The soup and orange chicken were pretty good. The egg foo young wasn't bad but there wasn't much flavor in the egg part.   Also, while I don't mind when someone has their kids hanging out while they're working, I know the struggle of being a working parent, it'd be nice to have them somewhat reigned in. I lost count of how many times we almost got hit by the stuff they were playing with and they were charging around our table like a tiny herd of buffalo.

Went in last weekend and tried the club. It was pretty cheap and for such a small sandwich, they packed on the meat and toppings. I honestly felt more full than I do when I get a footlong at a place like Subway. Also, the food is way better here and the staff was very nice and helpful since I didn't know what I was doing. I've been wanting to go back but unfortunately, there aren't any locations near my apartment. Will definitely go back here again.

Stopped by for boba because I was craving one and figured it would probably be a safe bet with the high ratings they have. Honestly, it was pretty disappointing. The boba tasted a lot like a powdery mix that wasn't stirred well enough. I tried to mix is a bit to see if that would help but it still ended up tasting super sweet and chalky.

Reading the previous reviews I feel like I missed something. Wanted a gyro today and thought I would try someplace new. Went in and the gentlemen working the counter were very nice and explained how everything worked and made some suggestions. I was already planning on a gyro so I went with that.   The pita was very good and ended up being the best part of the meal. The meat was swimming in oil/grease to the point where it was hard to choke down. The flavor was ok, but they were thick hunks that seemed like they were fried in oil to make them crispy. I generally prefer a more shaved gyro but my issue is more with all the grease pouring off the meat. The tzatziki sauce was very bitter and they used a ton of it. It was like having tzatziki meat soup served on a pita. I actually ended up scraping most of it off. It also didn't sit with me very well after the fact. I can't imagine I'll be back but based on all the good reviews, maybe it was just an off day.

Ended up here thanks to a fellow Yelper who told me to check it out. Went in today and ordered a jumbo hot dog and a cheeseburger. You'd think hot dogs would be mostly idiot proof, but it's honestly hard to find a good one when eating out. The burger was pretty good as well. I ordered a small cake shake and only got through about a third of it, but it tastes exactly like you would imagine. Also, Chynna, who took our order was very nice and helpful in answering our questions. She's also great at making you want to try everything on the menu. Hit this place up if you want a good hot dog, I plan on going back.

Ordered the burger with cheese, onions and bacon and some fries. The fries were ok, they unfortunately get soggy in the bag extremely quickly but they taste good. I'm sure they're much better if you're dining in and they don't have a chance to get steamed in the bag on the way home. The burger was excellent. When I pulled it out of the bag, it didn't look like much but it tasted great and the ingredients looked very good. The burger alone is easily worth going back.

My bro-in-law took me to this place last weekend for breakfast. Saturday morning around 10ish and it was packed out the door. I think we waited about 30 minutes for our table which wasn't too bad all things considered. Our server was extremely friendly and fast on getting us refills and explaining the menu, specials and answering any questions we had.   I ordered the chicken fried chicken with eggs and french toast along with a cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll was outstanding. It's a good size too, not small and not "Oh shit, I guess I'm passing pieces out to the other tables" big. The french toast was very dense and tasty. One piece is plenty and stupid me ordered 2, which I couldn't finish. The eggs were also very good (some places DO have bad eggs) as was the chicken and sausage gravy. Everything seemed homemade and I would be very interested in going back to try their lunch items, but they're spot on for breakfast, so go just for that.

I use this location on the weekend sometimes. It's usually not too crowded and they have a decent amount of equipment compared to some of the other locations. There usually isn't many machines that are down which is nice and the gym is kept pretty clean.

Stopped by this afternoon for an early dinner and ordered a caesar salad, meatball trio and mighty meaty pizza. Everything was brought out really quickly and was excellent. Our waitress was fast on bringing refills and we got in an out much quicker than I expected.

Went in today because they looked like they were open and got the chicken karraage, dragon roll and baked lobster roll. Everything was really good and served pretty quick. Definitely worth checking out if you want some sushi on this side of town, where there doesn't appear to be too many places serving it.

Went in today because I've eaten at the one in Vegas and enjoyed it. This one is not so good. The menu is tiny and the food was pretty mediocre. Service was pretty good but I don't think I'll be back.

Was out hitting casinos and bumming around and decided we wanted some pizza so we found this place on Yelp and stopped in. Our server Amber was fantastic. She was very funny, charming and answered all our questions. She also never let our drinks get past halfway empty before refilling them. Ordered an appetizer of bread and olives and then a pizza and everything was really good. If I'm back in this area, I will definitely hit them up again.

Went in for a boba and couldn't resist trying a donut. The boba was ok, it seems like they overcooked them a bit but the smoothie itself was good. The glazed donut I tried was excellent. I could easily see going back here just to grab some donuts. The lady working the counter was very nice.

Went in for lunch today and the young lady behind the counter set up a bunch of samples for us of the various meats. All of them were really good and I settled on a couple of large chicken tacos. Absolutely amazing and I wish I had gotten a couple more. I definitely will be back to try more of the menu.

Tried the egg drop soup, beef skewers, Mongolian beef and the house low mein. Everything was just ok. They were quick to get the food together and the people I dealt with were nice the food just didn't do anything for me. I ended up tasting a couple bites of everything, then put it all back into the bag to stuff in the fridge. Maybe someone else will eat it.

Ordered a cowboy burger and fries. The fries were pretty good, though a bit salty. They also give you a lot of them. The burger was good, though heavy. I couldn't finish it but everything on it tasted good. I will likely come back in the future.

Went in for breakfast a few weeks ago since I was in the area and had their chicken fried chicken, hash browns and eggs. Everything was really good and the portions were way too big. Service was also very good. Check this place out if you're starving and want to stuff yourself without breaking the bank.

Went in last night to try it out. The gentleman at the door was very friendly and helpful and explained how everything worked. When we got to the counter to order, they asked if we were first timers and brought out some samples. Ordered a couple different kinds of meat, some corn on the cob and a smoked potato with meat. The young lady working the counter was very nice and helped explain the menu further. Everything was pretty good and the seating was interesting with both large and small picnic-style tables. Definitely not the best BBQ I've ever had but it was good enough that I wouldn't mind going again.

Went back in tonight. Food was kind of meh but the part that annoys me is that we were told "15-20" minutes and it was almost an hour to the minute. While sitting in the place listening, they kept telling people "20 minutes" and not meeting that timeline at all. Also, I prepaid for my food online and the girls working the counter seemed to have no idea how that worked. I had to show them the sheet of paper they set on the counter showing my order and the fact that it was paid.   I'm fine with an hour wait for food on a Friday night, but tell people it's going to be an hour wait. If you're going there on a meal break from work, you generally don't want to spend an hour waiting around their tiny lobby hoping your food is going to come out in time. I doubt I'll bother going back, it's not worth the aggravation and there are other Rosati's that hopefully have their act together.

Went in yesterday for a boba and was pleasantly surprised. It was honestly one of the best bobas I've had, ever. I even tried the black milk tea boba which I normally don't like and it was good enough that I would consider ordering one next time. The people working the counter were also very nice and helpful. Check it out.

Ordered a cheesesteak and fries, and the sandwich was huge and really good. Fries were a touch too salty for me but I honestly cared more about the sandwich. Definitely will be back to try out other stuff as well. They were very fast filling the order, doing it online it was ready in less than 15 minutes for pickup.

After having several days from hell, I decided to get some pizza since I knew they would be open late and I was starving and they were close by. I was concerned that going in around midnight on a weekday, I would end up with questionable food but I was very wrong. Ordered a pizza with a couple toppings and was shocked at how good it was, especially for the price. I've had comparable pizzas cost twice as much or more. I'm going to turn this place into a regular stop now that I live close by.

I've been coming here for a couple months now and so far, no issues. Generally if equipment is down it's not down for long and it's usually not too busy that you have to wait to use anything. Some of the people complaining about fees apparently didn't read their contract considering everything is laid out for you before you sign so if you missed the maintenance fee or startup fee, you weren't paying attention.

Have been wanting to try a Firehouse Sub since they seem to be popping up everywhere and I pass by them pretty regularly. Finally did and I wasn't disappointed. Tried the pastrami and meatball subs and both were excellent. Will definitely be hitting them up again.

Went in for lunch not long after they opened for the day and put in an order for a meatball sub and a slice of pizza. The sub tasted ok but the bread was toasted so hard it was nearly inedible and the slice of pizza was about as New York as a cactus. The soda fountain was also out of ice and dispensing flat, warm soda and it felt like the AC wasn't on, which during the summer is an absolute mistake. It was cooler outside than it was inside. Also it took about a half hour to get the food. The only good thing about the place was the gentlemen working the counter were nice. I hope it was just a really off day.

Went in yesterday for a couple of quick rolls and everything was surprisingly good. The exterior makes this place look very much like a hole in the wall, which I don't mind as some hole in the wall places are great, but the inside is neat and clean and everything looked nice. It's a good spot to pop in and grab some sushi.

Was shopping in the plaza this place is located and decided to stop in, because you can never go wrong with burger. Ordered a BBQ bacon cheeseburger and a small chocolate malted milk ball malt. Damn, the burger was really good. There is nothing worse than a BBQ burger where they get skimpy on the sauce and this one definitely doesn't do that. The malt was pretty damn good too, but I couldn't finish it, the burger was inhaled in record time. Check this place out if you get the chance.

My family has been saying I needed to check this place out for months. Tried to get in at Lo Lo's up the road and couldn't find parking, so headed here. The selection of donuts is unique enough that you want to try a little bit of everything which I recommend but it's going to set you back a few bucks if you get a dozen and you're going to take most of them home because you'll be lucky to get through 2 of them if you ordered anything else. The flavors they have are pretty great and everything I tried was excellent.   The fried chicken though, that's the real deal. After tasting it I wanted to toss the donuts and get a bucket of it to go. It has a wonderful flavor and is juicy, crispy and perfect. I only tried the breast so I can't speak of any of the dark meat.   The people working the counter are extremely friendly, helpful and patient. They even fixed my order without complaint after I screwed up what I ordered. Definitely check this place out and bring your appetite.

My 200th review!  I ended up here because of a post on 9Gag of all places. Ordered some mozzarella sticks and a large pizza. The mozzarella and sauce were great, I would have been happy with a double order of those by themselves. The pizza was pretty good. I really liked the crust and they are very generous with the cheese. There is nothing better than grabbing a slice of pizza and having cheese stretch everywhere. It was a little heavy on the seasoning, but other than that it was good. I'd like to go back and try their calzones sometime and maybe a cannoli.

Decided to have gyros for lunch and was nearby so we stopped in. The gentleman working the counter was nice and helpful and explained everything to us. Ordered a gyro with fries and some calamari. The calamari didn't taste like anything. It wasn't overcooked or anything there was just no flavor. The fries that came with the gyro were pretty good but the gyro itself was disappointing to say the least. I ended up eating maybe half before tossing it. I have too many other places I love to go for gyros so I doubt I'll be back.

"The Chipotle of Pizza"   The person who said that nailed it. The place even looks like a Chipotle.You go in and order a pizza and tell them what you want from the line of toppings, like a Chipotle or Subway. For $8 it's a pretty decent little pizza. They're pretty much all thin crust from what I observed and the people working there are very friendly and helpful. It's a good spot to grab a quick bite.

Placed an online order for calzone, cheese and bacon tater tots and some chocolate chip cookies. When I got home I had a message that part of my order wasn't given to me so I went back and they threw in some extra cookies. Everything was really good and both the gentlemen I dealt with were very nice and apologetic for the mixup. They also gave us several free cookies to make up for it. Definitely a good place to check out if you want some calzones and fresh cookies. The fact that they're open late is even better.

I've been in twice now and decided to add the business since I couldn't find it on Yelp. I haven't tried the donuts, so take that into account. The review is strictly for the boba which both times has been very good. The lady working the counter has been very nice and she slaps them together pretty fast. I will keep coming back here as often as possible.

After calling around to several places, I decided to hire Poindexter for my move. First because the person I spoke to on the phone was extremely helpful, didn't pressure me and gave me a bunch of advice on what to ask other movers for their quotes. They also ended up being the least expensive quote I received. AJ and Jake showed up right on time to move me and busted ass the entire time they were there. I had budgeted out a certain amount for the move figuring the rate and number of hours I thought it would take them and they beat it by nearly half. They also asked if I needed any help setting anything up or rearranging anything at my new apartment after they had unloaded. This was the first time I've ever hired movers and it was worth every penny.

I've been wanting to try this place for awhile since I kept seeing their signs for 'street tacos'. I finally went in today to check them out. Ordered a couple barbacoa tacos and a chicken quesadilla with some salsa from the salsa bar. Everything was really good and the people working the front counter were very nice. I wouldn't hesitate to go back and try more dishes.

I've been wanting to try this place for awhile. Finally got around to doing it yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. I've never had real Canadian poutine by comparison, but this place was excellent. I tried the BBQ sandwich, burger, traditional poutine, cheese curds and the beef and crispy onion poutine. Everything was prepared perfectly and the gentlemen working there were helpful and friendly. Definitely will be going back.

Was looking for open places near my new apartment and this one popped up. Got some horchata, beans, chicken quesadilla and a steak taco. Everything was pretty good, my only gripe would be that the chicken quesadilla(more like tacos) was pretty oily. Otherwise it's a good place to grab a quick bite.

I ate at one of the Chicago locations a few years ago and loved it. When I saw they were opening one in Phoenix, I was excited but apprehensive that it wouldn't be anywhere near as good. Went in this Sunday night and got into a very long line of people waiting to get in. Some people were bailing because of the line, but we decided to stick it out. It probably took 15-20 minutes to get to the front where you put your name in. During that wait, they had people walking through the line handing out little pieces of their thin pizza and it was excellent. It's also a great way to keep people waiting by teasing them with the food they're going to get inside.   After putting my name in they said it would be an hour to an hour-ten minute wait. They take your phone number and send you a text when you're up and they also have a link in the text message so you can see your place in queue, which is pretty cool. Even better, when you put your name in, you can tell them what pizza you want so you don't have to wait a second time once you're seated. It ended up being about 90 minutes before we were seated and because of the pre-order, our deep dish pizza was at the table less than 10 minutes after we were seated, which is awesome.   As for the food, we had a deep dish pepperoni pizza, the combination platter appetizer and I ordered an Italian Beef sandwich to go (breakfast!). Everything was really good and a large deep dish is easily enough for 4 people, maybe more. We had a party of three and took home almost half the pizza. The service was also excellent and our server was very friendly and helpful as were the various hosts and staff that greeted and seated everyone. Definitely going to be going back as often as possible and you should too.
