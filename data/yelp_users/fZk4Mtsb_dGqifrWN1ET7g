Yum!  I am so glad I stopped by today to try this place out.   I was craving a really good, yet simple sandwich today.  As I was driving up Camelback, I remembered how I have passed this place over a thousand times growing up, and it's still there(that has to be a good sign).   When I pulled up I was a little intimidated to go inside because I wanted to eat my food there,  and it looked like there wouldn't be anywhere to sit inside.  But a quick check on Yelp and I discovered they do have seating inside, and someone's review led me to order the Doughboy.  Simple yet AMAZING!  The bread and meat are to die for, so the mayo, bacon, and cheese all warmed up together just hit the spot.  Its one of those meals that you think you can make at home, but for some reason it is just so darn good made by someone else.  Well Cheese and Stuff, you can make my sandwich anytime!   I will be back again and again and again.  *Quick service too.  Got in, ordered, and ate within 12 min.

Just go.  Get the bruschetta.  Get a $5 glass of wine.  Get another.  Get another.  Get another.  Call a taxi.  Come back tomorrow.  Repeat as needed.

Oh my goodness I am in love with this place!  After moving to the area and passing by numerous times, I bit the bullet and made a last minute reservation for 2.  I'm pretty sure I called at 6:45 on a Friday and they had a table for me at 8...perfect amount of time to fix my makeup and walk over.  We arrived at a very busy, yet almost casual vibe.  I gave them my name, and we were seated right in the middle of the restaurant(and right in the middle of the action).  Now let me preface by saying I am kind of a snob when it comes to seating in a restaurant.  If they put me all the way in the back, anywhere near the bathroom or kitchen doors, I will usually tell them I will wait at the bar with a cocktail while I wait for another table.  But tonight, I felt like we lucked out with the best table in the house!  Once seated, we ordered a nice bottle of Cab, and the sausage bruschetta for $10.  Shortly after, we ordered the Complimenti alla Mamma pizza, which consists of Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Ricotta, Ham,Salame, Parmigiano Reggiano for $15.  After waiting for what seemed like a longer amount of time than normal for an appy to arrive, the pizza came to our table.  When we brought the issue up to the waiter, he had totally forgot to order it, and immediately put it in for us, and on the house.    The pizza is to die for.  Since then, I have ordered this pizza for take out, and it is amazing every time.  The ricotta is fresh and delicious, the salame and ham bring a saltiness to the pizza, and the crisp crust makes it the best pizza I have had in Arizona.    The total came to $36, not bad for a whole pie, appy, and a nice bottle of red.    I will be walking my little arse here again and again to enjoy this lovely, wood fired pizza.  Only thing is, I dont know if I could even try a different pizza than the Mamma....IT IS SOOOOO GOOOD.  OMG Nom I'm hungry now.  Salivating.  Arrrgg.

Uggg.  I was on the fence as to even write a review because I really, really wanted to love this place, but I didn't.  I just moved to the area, so you can imagine my excitement when I discovered on Yelp that there was a more "hole in the wall"  sushi place in my area, other than the bigger restaurants such as RA, Stingray, Kona(which I all love, but I am a sushi freak...could eat it every day, and love the weird stuff).  After working late this past Tuesday, I had a need for ikura and a big glass of wine.  So, Dozo sounded like the perfect "first try" restaurant in my area.  I walked in to a pretty crowded restaurant, so this seemed like a great sign to me.  I stood at the front desk, looking around and seeing that the waitresses and the sushi bar guys clearly saw me.  This indication probably should have led me straight back out the door.  After about 5 minutes of standing, a lady comes and seats me.  She comes back promptly to take my drink order...glass of Kendal Jackson chardonnay and a water.  Those come out quickly, and she takes my order, so far so good.  Squid salad, ikura, and sweet shrimp with heads(told you I liked the weird stuff).  After looking around, I noticed about 4 tables(and this is a small place) were not cleaned off at all, and the couple next to me was waiting and looking around for a sauce for their tempura(which I saw her bring sans sauce a good couple minutes before).  With their sauce in hand, she brings me my squid salad.  It was good, small portion, but squid salad is always pretty small(it was $6).  Then, I do not see the waitress for 30 min.  I had sent a text around the time when she brought my squid, so I knew the exact time.  After 30, she came over and said the food should be right up. My wine is now gone, and I am pretty annoyed.  I ask her to bring my check with the food, as I do not want to wait another who knows how long for that to come.  She then comes over, without my food, and tell me they are out of ikura, and would I like something else.  WTF?!?!  NO, I just waited 35 minutes for you to tell me you are out of something that should literately take 1 minutes to make.  A couple minutes later my sweet shrimps arrived and the bill.  The shrimps were pretty good, and the heads too.  Not spectacular, but standard.  My bill was $22(8.50 for the glass of wine, yikes).  I asked her if it always takes this long, as I just moved to the area and was planning on coming here quite often.  She said since the cold snap let up, more people came to have dinner than usual. I don't know if that's convincing enough to try again, as other reviews clearly stated they were understaffed.  My relaxing dinner for one turning into a stressful(and small) dining nightmare.  I love sushi so much, that I will most likely give this place another chance, due to the proximity to my house.  I really hope I can write a better review next time : (

Whenever I would be in Old Town, all my friends would marvel in the fact that I had never been to Patties before, saying "It will be your new favorite bar," and "I can't believe YOU have never been here."    Well, now I live in Old Town, and it IS my favorite bar.  I like my bars divey, but with the right amount of people my own age so I dont feel like I'm intruding in some Cheers like 50-something day drunks bar where the music would stop when I walked in and everyone turns around and stares.  So Patties.  I love you.  During the day, its not very busy, which means the ping pong table is usually open and the bar will keep my vodka sodas coming.  At night, it turns into a "trendy dive" bar, where it is crowded, but with all the right people.  I usually end up making a new friend, playing shuffleboard, or enjoy the people watching from the patio(which you can smoke in).  So if you don's like places where you can smell people smoking, I would recommend not going to Patties.  But if you don't mind, and want to have a badass time in just your jeans and nothing fancy, then meet me at Patties!

After passing(and judging) this place multiple times on my way to Fry's, I had never stopped in.  I LOVE sushi with a capital "Get in my belly," but with the strip mall location and pictures of the menu items displayed on the windows, I choose to skip over this hidden gem.  That is, until one hungover day I was craving Tempura Udon soup.  I hopped on Yelp, saw their menu, and choose to give JK Sushi a try.  Boy was I glad I did!  I ended up also ordering a caterpillar roll, edamame, and ikura sushi to go(adventurous I know!)  Everything was fabulous!  The soup was so amazing, and at $5.75 I was very impressed.  The soup did not come with any tempura, but usually when it does at other restaurants it can range from $10-12.  Since then my boyfriend and I have been back a couple time.  Each time they are very friendly, we are seatied right away, and the pictures on the wall actually help me decide on something new.  Overall, highly recommended!  They have only beer, wine, and saki, and the saki bombs are a little pricey.  I would love to see a happy hour menu here someday, but wishful thinking.  Oh and something I figured out about the 3rd time I was there.  JK stands for Japanese and Korean.  I have tried 2 of their Korean dishes, and they all come with rice and 4 little side dishes(kimchi, potato, spicy cucumbers, ect).

Ok, so this is my first "beauty" review as I am a usual foodie Yelper, but  after two amazing facials at this salon, I felt obligated to write a review.  I am recently engaged, and I wanted my skin to look fabulous for my upcoming engagement photos.  I originally came in for just a normal facial, but my aesthetician Danielle suggested a 4 layer facial, which I had never had before.  Holy wow my skin has never been so dewy and glowing.  I have been to other salons around the valley, and a couple at top resorts, but I never feel like I got personalized one on one service or advice.  She really listened to my needs and personalized my facial to what I needed.  I always felt like just another "in and out the door" customer at some of the other places.  I received so many compliments on our Save the Date pictures....I couldn't be happier with the results.  I will now be going to Danielle for more treatments leading up to my wedding day, and I can't wait to see those pictures!

Eww, do not waste your time at all going here.  I bought the Groupon they had going...$40 for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, a bottle of wine, and a dessert...what a deal! I just moved to the area and was super stoked to get all that for $40, at what looked like a really nice place.  I checked out their Yelp page before buying the Groupon, and the pictures all looked amazing.  That charcuterie plate, the yellowtail crudo, foie gras, whole sea bass!  YUM.  Well folks, those are all pictures of the old restaurant CUOCO PAZZO.  These gave me a completely different idea of what I thought this meal would be like.  False advertising, and, for my sake, super disappointing.     I ordered the beef stroganoff.  It was watery, the pasta was soggy, and the chunks of steak in there had to be from an overcooked steak someone sent back a couple days ago.  It was almost ashy in color, really tough, and legitimately looked and tasted really old.   I picked out the mushrooms to eat, but lets just say it was hardly touched.  My boyfriend ordered the bison burger.  He said it was really overcooked, and nothing special.  For him to not take leftovers for lunch the next day is pretty rare.  We asked for our chocolate cake to go(and gave it to our neighbor).  When the bill came, I had shown the waiter my Groupon, and he marked it as used.  Now here is where my experience went from never coming back, to writing an extremely negative review(which I rarely ever do).  I had asked the waiter if I can leave his tip on my debit card, since I wanted to tip him and I did not have cash.  He said sure, I can charge you 1 penny and then you can leave the tip.  We left a tip, and never looked back.  Until I saw my card was charged $97.74 when I checked my bank account that following Sunday.  When I was finally able to contact the restaurant(they aren't open Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday until dinner service) the owner called Merchant services and told me the full amount would be credited back to me within 3-15 days.  Well just today I had to call up my bank and have this issue resolved for me...it has been almost a month!  Not only was the place empty on a Wednesday night, which is very strange for Old Town Scottsdale, the food was bad, and the service I received after the fact was even worse.  I don't think I would come back to this restaurant even if the food was free.  Man that sounds so harsh to say...I love writing fun, happy reviews.  Unfortunately, fun and happy(or yummy)was far from what I received.

This place is my favorite place to get a spray tan.  Before coming here I realize I was getting the worst spray tans ever and not even knowing it.  After other places, I would have to put a towel down in my car because the tan would get everywhere and I would be very very dark until I showered.  My boyfriend would hate when I could get a spray tan before because I would look scary Jersey tan, not natural.  Laura is always so sweet and friendly, I look forward to chatting with her during my tan.  The first couple times I went I didn't even realize she was the owner because she is so nice and humbled.    The first time I came in here I was asking where the lotion was to put on the bottom on my hands and feet, and Laura told me I wont need it.  At other places I would have streaks and tan gathered in the wrinkles of my feet...gross.  All I can say is I am so glad I randomly found this place, and I will now not go anywhere else.  Also, be sure to ask her about sending your after pictures in.  I sent in one of my engagement pictures and she gave me a free tan

Went to this new Upward Project restaurant last Friday for date night with my boyfriend.  We had been wanting to try it for awhile, as we both LOVE Postinos, Windsor, and well, pizza!  I had an email from my birthday which gave us a guaranteed reservation and free dessert.  I called in the car on the way there, and they said they would put my name at the top of the list.  When we arrived, they had already put my name in and said they would call when ready.  Well 40 minutes later, my boyfriend went to ask about how much longer, and they had lost my reservation.  We went back to wait, this time only about 5 minutes.  Sadly though, when they came to seat us, we were jammed in at the hot and crowded pizza oven bar.  One of the seats we were given was not even a regular seat with a back, rather a bar stool from the outside.  We quickly said that will not do, and the hostess seated us in a cute, romantic booth by the patio.  Problem solved...thank you Federal Pizza!  Now that all is well, we ordered the brussel sprout side dish and the date, ricotta, arugula, and prosciutto pizza.  The brussel sprouts were a little lemony, but the panchetta made everything better.  The pizza was delicious...I would highly recommend trying it!   The silver lining about this place is they will come take your drink order while you wait for your table, then add it to your tab at the end.  For a trendy place like this, I will happily wait if there is a big glass of Cab in my hand!    Can't wait to go back and experiment with more pizzas!
