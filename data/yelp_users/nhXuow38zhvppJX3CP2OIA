I'm sorry to say, but I think this place was mediocre at best.  I always like to try little hole in the wall Chinese restaurants (which always tend to be the best compared to Chinese corporate america) but sadly I wasn't impressed.   The price is cheap which is the only thing going for them (in my opinion) but the taste is very bland for the type of Chinese I was hoping they would be. I will contradict myself for a moment and say that I will probably go back here for 2 reasons only...1 Location, 2 Cheap Price, but I would never recommend anyone to go here if they asked me for a good Chinese restaurant...hence my 2 stars.

A good friend that recently moved here from Chicago recommended this place to me because he said this was best pizza hes ever had...and he was right! This place is downright delicious!...who cares about their old fashion decor when their pizza is that good!  It's a little bit of a hike to get to if you don't live in Cave Creek but it is definitely worth the drive.

Ugh, I think this place has some serious potential for their sushi.  I don't even care about the bright lighting or off decor (or there lack of).   I read the reviews everyone has left below and I'm not sure I've had the same experience. I think they've seriously cheaped out on a lot of areas and that's why I write a 2 star review...is it the worst I've ever had?...no.  The last time we went in there (and I've been a handful of times because its my brothers favorite sushi spot) we were served warm sushi.  Everything we ordered was (supposed to be) a cold roll but because they used warm rice, it was warm sushi. :/  Plus, they stuff their rolls with crab mix which makes everything taste the same.  The dragon roll tastes just like the spicy scallop roll, weird.   Also, I'm not sure what they serve as wasabi is a good quality.  It's liquidy and not spicy at all.   IDK future readers, I think you can find a better quality somewhere else.

Hands down, this place is absolutely awesome!  Our waiter was super helpful and made us feel right at home ( I wish I could remember his name to give him the shout out he deserves) and added to the whole experience of this brewery.    Everything we ordered (minus the lobster bisque - which I sent back) was to die for.  Try the blue crab and artichoke dip when your go in!    I will definitely be coming back for more!!!!

What a great place to grab a burger!  No matter how you want it, this place will grill it up just right.  I was surprised when the bill came that it wasn't as expensive as I expected.  The bar could work on creating some better specialty drinks but other than that, I would go to this place again.

We discovered this place through everyone's Yelp reviews and they were right - this place is simply AMAZING!  I wish I could come here more often but it seems to be our before Ikea stop to fill up before we battle those awful crowds.  Please expand your reach and open a place in north Phoenix so we can enjoy your food more often!

I'll most likely be the only 1 star review on here but I don't care.  This place looks pretty on the outside, but don't be fooled by the glitz and glam of this Biltmore Sushi place...    Let me first start with my experience last night... I wasn't terribly hungry but I thought I would meet up with some friends and I just ordered a simple Philly Roll.  I'm not a big fan of smoked salmon (which comes standard in that roll) so I ask if I could have fresh salmon instead.  Placed my order and the server comes back out and lets me know that there would be a $3 up-charge for fresh salmon.  No thank you, please cancel my order.  1 minute later the food runner comes out and says, "Here's your roll with fresh salmon" and I told her that I cancelled this order because of the up-charge, which she responds back by saying they will send it back.  Send it back, you mean throw it away?  Really?  You're really not going to give it to me now, you're going to send it back?  So the food runner responds that she will ask her manager for permission...Needless to say I recovered the roll at regular price, but I couldn't believe there would be $3 up-charge for fresh salmon!  Holy crap, way to over charge for the most simple roll.   Second...Don't go in for lunch...this place has so many flies that you are constantly battling swatting flies away while trying to enjoy your overpriced-mediocre sushi roll.  Hopefully with the weather getting cooler the problem has become better BUT never-the-less I just thought you should know....  From the outside this place looks awesome-on the inside its modern decor will catch your attention-the sushi is not great but its ok-your bill, overcharged

Awful place. For starters their chairs are so un-comfortable. They are so old and the massage part that I'm sure worked at one point sticks into your back. Next I got a 5 min leg massage which was more like a 10 year old rubbing lotion on you. I paid the $4 to have them callus my feet (which werent that bad to begin with) and had to ask them to redo after they moved on to the part. They don't push down your cuticles so when they go to put color on there is a jagged line. Bottom line.... I could have done a much better with the stuff I have in my cabinets. Don't go here no matter how cheap, you still dont get your money worth

Not the type of restaurant I was expecting.  Order and seat yourself style.  Prices are low.  Taste is very bland - no spices, no seasoning.  VERY AMERICAN, no real Mexican flavor to it.  Boring!  Salsa bar is a great idea, but even that has no flavor.  The hot salsa was more of a mild flavor.  Customer service is amazing though! Never had to get up to fill up my drink, constantly asking you if you need anything too.  I probably wouldn't come here again, although I am glad I tried it, I would prefer to go somewhere with a little more flavor.

My boyfriend is going to hate that I'm leaving this review because we like to call this "our spot" but I thought everyone on Yelp should know how amazing this place is.  I'm not going to start with how amazing the sushi is just yet...First, I love how at home we feel every time we go in.  I have to admit I was a little skeptical of trying a sushi place in this shopping center but boy was I wrong, VERY wrong.  The people here are simply amazing and the price is just right!  Ok, now for the sushi part, I'm in love...here's a list of our top favs (not in any particular order) and hopefully they will become your favs too!  1.Superman Burrito Roll 2.Volcano Roll 3.Superstar 4. Casey Roll

This was a first time experience for me and it was AWESOME! We sat out on patio (which is much quieter than inside) the weather was perfect, we sat with great company, had an awesome waiter and delicious food.  I really couldn't ask for more. I love that they had gluten free options too!  This will be a regular spot for me as long as I can sit on the patio.  I admit if I sat inside I might have a different opinion of this place.  When i walked inside to go to the bathroom I realized how LOUD it was inside. They definitely need to work on the acoustics to make it more personal for each table.  AND pretty please arrange your table better so there can be a more clear path to the bathroom.  All in all, this places deserve a 5!

This is such a great date spot!  I love everything about their pizza and fresh toppings! This place has become 1 of my favorite pizza places nearby.   The only reason I give this a 4 star review is because the Golden BBQ Wings are just awful!...If you love mustard, than these wings are for you.  I expected it to be more of a honey BBQ flavor, but boy was I wrong! They should either rethink their sauce recipe or perhaps rename the wing.  It's too bad I got these ToGo or I would have returned them after the first bite.
