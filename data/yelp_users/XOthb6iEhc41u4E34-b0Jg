In the history of dive bars, there was one. It was called Bikini.   This will be my favorite bar in Phoenix, always.   The end.

I grew up here, going to shows and just hanging out. This place is my other home in Phoenix. They always have great shows and JRC and Steph work their asses off to make sure Phoenix has an all-ages venue that Phoenix can brag about.

I've heard nothing but good things about this place for ages. I don't live on the east side, so it took me a while to get over here. Let me tell you. Was I disappointed? Yes. Very much so.   The draft beer tasted off. Like fucking awful off. Order a burger. Tastes off too. Tastes sterile. Like I'm eating a fucking hospital.   I've heard this place doesn't charge for the live music. Weird, because I was just told that I "Have to move or pay $15" to see some shitty band, while I was still waiting for my shitty burger to come out. Fuck this place. Will I ever be back? Never. Not in a million fucking years. This is the most miserable shithole of all my existence.

You have to be pretty bad to be a cheap Americanized Chinese joint to have me write a bad review of you. My standards really aren't high. I just moved to Charlotte from out of state and this place was around the corner so I figured I'd check it out. Oops. I called in an order for pick-up for what I normally order when I have never been to a Chinese place before. The orange chicken, egg roll & crag rangoons. These are pretty much the most basic staples of Americanized chinese food and if you can't do these right, you probably shouldn't be in business. On the phone I was told 15 minutes. I got there 15 minutes later and paid and waited. It was about 10 to 15 minutes later that a child of one of the employees finally brought out my order. Here's a word of advice: Don't call yourself FAST Wok if you can't get the food out by the time you say it will be there. (There was maybe one or two other people there at the time; definitely not a full house).So I finally get home and the orange chicken is pretty much tasteless. No flavor, whatsoever. The meat was not of good quality either, so no. Just no. The crab rangoons were also of poor quality and almost tasteless. The only thing that was even adequate was the egg roll. I have only tried one one other Chinese place in the area yet, but suffice it to say, it was miles better than this place. Do yourself a favor, get some flavor and save some time, skip Fast Wok.

I brought my macbook pro into these guys because it had become very unresponsive. I really had to have it fixed ASAP, so I figured I would drop it off with experts instead of wasting time trying to fix it myself. Big mistake.  When I dropped it off, they said there was probably some issue with the hard drive. They charge $30 for a diagnosis which can go toward any repairs. They took two days to look at it, then called me and said there were a  couple issues. They said there were a couple minor issues with the hard drive, which they said the fixed and then they said the other issue was that the plastic pieces which hold the second memory stick down were broken, that what was creating the problem. Well, I had a piece of material keeping the memory stick down, using the pressure of the back panel.... but they said that it was unresponsive because the memory would still move around some and recommended that I just find something else to keep the memory down better. They said they had fixed most of the unresponsiveness by fixing whatever issues they found with the hard drive though. I said, okay. It sounded reasonable. I turned it on when I got home and it was the exact same as when I brought it in. Still just as unresponsive. What the heck? You had it for two days and didn't fix anything, but tell me you fixed most of it? So, I have most of my info backed up, so I just decided to try to delete everything off of the hard drive and re-install everything from my back up drive. (In the shop, I explained to them that my info was backed up and told them it was okay to do this if they needed to). Well, I did that, and it fixed the issue. Guess I should have tried that before wasting the $30 and lost two days bringing it in, but seriously? You don't try that in the two days you have it in the shop? One of the most simple fixes there probably is? I am no computer expert, and I fix what they can't? These guys obviously don't know what they're doing.

We had a groupon for this place and he did not honor it. Apparently they didn't go through the trouble of actually preparing for the amount of people that would come for the groupon, so they just didn't bother with trying. So we didn't even get to eat here, but from what I saw the food looked average and the place was fairly dirty. This place doesn't deserve the one star yelp forces me to give them.

Watch out ASU Students. These guys have a "coupon" in the student coupon book that they will refuse to honor when you bring it in. Scam artists who will not honor coupons with NO FINE PRINT, will not tell you how much they charge until you come in to pay and will over-charge with no proof that they actually fix your phone. Not willing to even work with you despite having printed official coupons with their information and services. Rude, deal in cash only (already a bad sign) and I repeat WILL NOT ACTUALLY FIX YOUR PHONE. Lie about the guarantee, if it's anything EXCEPT a screen fix they will not guarantee their work which speaks volumes about their trust in their own competence in repairing cell phones. do NOT go here, do NOT waste your money and time. VERY BAD "BUSINESS".
