Einstein's is an okay chain.  It's not my favorite but in a pinch, it can hit the spot.  This location, however, leaves a lot to be desired.  I've stopped in multiple times due to the convenient location but I always leave disappointed.    The food here is the standard Einstein's fare.  I'm not a real bagel fan but I have sampled a few of the breakfast sandwiches.  They were okay, nothing memorable.  I usually stop in for a coffee or a latte.  This last visit really made me mad.  I ordered a hot chai latte and ended up leaving with something else (never figured out what the drink was).  Unfortunately, I was a good ways down the road before the drink had cooled enough for me to take a sip.  Aaargh!  What really annoys me about this location is the lack of customer service.  I've found that the folks working behind the counter are rather gruff and unfriendly. On this last visit, the young lady didn't greet me and refused to look me in the eye.  It's been a similar story with my previous visits.  The store seems to stay fairly busy in the morning hours.  I don't know if this contributes to the service problem or not.  Either way, I've made my final visit.  I can get a hot drink elsewhere.

Authentic French cuisine!  Lunch was delightful.  The turkey panini is delicious.  It was served with a simple green side salad -  just my style.  Fortunately (for my waistline only), I skipped over the desserts.  They were tempting, though.  The tarts and mousse looked divine.    The dining experience was elevated by the attentiveness of the owners.  They were extremely friendly and genuinely concerned about my enjoyment of the meal. Oh, their accents didn't hurt either!  Tres magnifique!

I travel a good deal.  This is the worst hotel experience, by far.  This is an older Embassy Suites but I thought that its location in the tony Biltmore area of Phoenix would assure that it's well-kept.  Incorrect assumption.  This is the filthiest hotel I've ever seen.  I should have known I was in for utter disappointment when I arrived for my stay around 12:45 am.  I am dead tired and fumbling with two bags when I happen upon a security guard standing in front of the hotel taking a smoke.  Instead of holding the door for me, he watched me balance my bags and purse with an amused grin, as I struggled with the the hotel door.  Thanks for nothing.  I get to the front desk and the check-in process is fairly smooth.  I'm booked into a room that is on a far end of the hotel.  I hike over there and proceed to get ready for bed when more problems ensue. The bathroom wall has what appears to be a streak of blood running down it.  I was too grossed out to investigate further.  There is also a bent wire hanger on the picture frame over the toilet.  The wallpaper is peeling and the ceiling is showing signs of a bad leak from upstairs.  Really?  I am appalled at this point but since it's after 1 am, I reason that I can just get a little shut-eye and change rooms first thing in the morning.  My plans quickly changed when I turned down the bed covers to find lint and make-up on them.  I can't do this.  I call the front desk and request an immediate room change.  The lady I spoke too was extremely apologetic and offered to move me right away.  She said she'd send up a security guard to help with my bags and get me into a better room/area of the hotel.  You know where this is going, right?  Yes, approximately 10 minutes later the grinning smoker appears at the door.  He hands me a key for a room on the opposite side of the hotel and makes the assessment that I have a pretty good handle on my bags so he'll just point me in the direction of where I should go.  The new room looks exactly like the first one, albeit a little cleaner.  The bathroom looked acceptable and the bed covers were free of foreign substances.  It was past my bedtime, I needed sleep.  With a little rest and fresh eyes, the hotel didn't get any better for me.  I'm sure in its heyday this was THE place to stay.  Sadly, it is just neglected and doesn't warrant the nightly room charges (it's not cheap).  The common areas are filthy.  I promise that I'm not a germaphobe.  I really didn't want to touch anything in this hotel.  The elevator buttons and door handles were dirty.  I had to carry napkins with me so I wouldn't have to touch them.  The carpet in the lobby and elevators looked like a ton of toddlers had had their way with a box of Ritz crackers.  And, no, I didn't catch them on an off day.  It looked like this for my entire three-day stay.  I failed to mention the ceiling fan in my new and improved "clean" room.  The dust hanging off of it was so thick.  It clearly hadn't been touched in ages.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel lobby also has an off-putting stench, probably due to the fountains/ponds inside?  I don't know but it's unpleasant.  If the filth wasn't bad enough, on the last day of my stay I was jarred from sleep at 4 am by a blaring fire alarm.  I pulled the curtain back and saw other guests milling about.  Apparently, there is no intercom system to let guests know what they should do.  When I saw another guest return to her room, I took the gamble that I'd burn in this cess pool and went back to bed.  It was a short-lived nap.  A few hours later, the alarm is blaring again!  I'm deliriously tired and in the process of the pulling on a pair of jeans to exit when housekeeping opens the door.  Really?  The alarm is going off,  it's still early in the a.m. and you're coming in the room to clean?  What in the hell?  What do you clean, anyway?  At this point, I knew it was time to part ways.  I quickly packed and made my exit.  Unbelievable and unforgivable.  Never again.

I was elated when I discovered I'd be in town for the mojito class that the restaurant periodically offers. I'd been eyeing it for years but it never seemed to coincide with my business travels.  Well, luck shone on me and I was able to attend last night.  I must say for $20 tuition, it was a bargain!  The restaurant owner not only teaches the fine art of making a killer mojito, you are also treated to a brief lesson in Cuban history and culture.  It was very interesting!  The restaurant supplies all the ingredients and you craft your own cocktail, according to instruction.  There are also fun prize raffles and lots of laughter.  I can't forget to mention that the class fee also includes a tapas plate featuring some of Havana Cafe's fabulous appetizers.  You also get 15% off if you decide to stick around for dinner.  It was a win-win evening.  I still prefer the original location but I can't visit the Valley without getting my Cuban fix.  Yum.

This is home away from home on the bulk of my visits to Phoenix/Scottsdale.  It's business travel so this hotel meets company spending guidelines.  That aside,  Courtyard Scottsdale Old Town is similar to others I've stayed at across the country.  It underwent a lobby renovation a few years ago and that helped immensely!  Prior to that, the lobby/dining area was drab and depressing.  I used to dread my visits here!  The update left the hotel entrance with a bright, airy feel to it.  Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that the rooms have been similarly updated.  While not terrible, they could use a facelift, as well.  However, what makes this Courtyard is its front desk staff.  As several other reviewers have commented, they really are awesome!  One young lady, in particular, is exceptional.  No matter how long it's been between my stays (sometimes at least a year has passed) she ALWAYS remembers me and greets me warmly.  Of course, as I'm typing my review I realize I don't even know her name to give her proper credit.  D'oh!  Anyway, it's touches like these that really make me feel like a valued guest.  It is appreciated and results in an extra star for an otherwise 3 star hotel.

Marginal at best.   I expected great things based on the Yelp reviews and from asking locals.  What a disappointment.  I was not turned off by the dated decor; it's rather charming in its own funky way.  Besides, you get some of the best Mexican food at the no-frills places.  However, this food was sub par.  The salsa was watery and I could have made the enchiladas much better myself.  Also, I was less than impressed with my margaritas.  I tried two different varieties to be sure :) but that was a waste.  Absolutely nothing stood out about this place.    Where, oh where is the great Mexican food in Phoenix/Scottsdale?

CBTL became my go-to caffeine stop during my recent trip to the Valley.  It was nice to take a break from Starbucks and experience some different flavors.  Yes, it really is different.  The lattes were creamier and better tasting, the pastries more delectable and the tea offerings more plentiful.  I had a chance to sample several things from the menu and didn't end up disappointed.  The employees were helpful in offering up suggestions when I was in the mood for something different but uncertain of what that might be...  I always got my order to-go but I can see this not being a particularly great spot to hang out in for hours at a time.  It isn't exactly cozy.  If the weather allows it, they have a small outdoor area with tables and chairs.  It faces the parking lot but didn't seem to be so bad for a short visit.  Based on my experience, I'd definitely return.

AZ 88 is a staple when I visit Scottsdale, always a treat!  The restaurant is off the beaten path and has an ultra hip vibe to it.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive.  The highlight, of course, is the menu.  They offer a great selection of burgers, sandwiches and salads.  They really know how to make a great salad too (I'm convinced this is an art that is rarely mastered).  I highly recommend the shrimp salad with the citrus dressing.  It's divine.  I have not been disappointed with anything I've ordered, though.  I'm already looking forward to my next visit.

My overall rating dipped a star from my last visit.  The service here sucks!  They appeared to be fully staffed during the dinner hour, yet it took more than five minutes for someone to acknowledge my presence at the wait stand.  Employees were milling around tending to more important stuff, I guess.  Not sure what ranks above a potential paying customer. When I was finally seated and attended to, it didn't get much better.  The waiter was curt and impatient.    The food wasn't bad.  I opted for a house margarita (no bueno/poorly made) and two of the appetizers.  I must say the appetizers were great. This restaurant offers a twist on what I consider traditional Mexical cuisine.  They do a nice job so the flavors aren't so outlandish and out of line with what you're expecting.  They also provide you with chips and salsa to start.  The chips were light, crispy and freshly made; however, the salsa left tons to be desired.  They brought two varieties out with the chips and I didn't care for either one.  Both lacked flavor.   Los Sombreros could really improve in my eyes if they acted like they gave a damn about their customers.  I didn't get that impression on either visit.

I visited Veneto Trattoria for the first time at lunch today.  What a pleasant surprise!  I love the cozy atmosphere of this quaint restaurant and the attentiveness of the wait staff.  Of course, the food was divine!  I highly recommend the salmon salad, if you're looking for lighter fare.  It was delicious - flavorful, moist and sized just right.  My co-worker was also impressed with his pasta dish.  I will definitely keep Veneto Trattoria in my Scottsdale rotation!

Just have to add that I was so impressed with Veneto Trattoria that I ended up eating there three times in a two week span!  The food and the service were consistently great.  Can't wait to get back to Scottsdale!

I really love Pita Jungle.  There are few places I go to eat where the entire menu is appealing.  This is one of those spots.  It allows you to be healthy or indulgent; the choice is yours.  The awesome thing:  it's all delicious.  I'm a fan of their salads.  They're huge, stockpiled with loads of fresh ingredients.  I love to get a side of falafel and hummus.  Good stuff.  This location really stands out because of the service.  Graham helped me when I dropped in for dinner.  He was great:  attentive, witty and fast!  Without a doubt, I'll be back.

The food is simply delicious!   I've eaten at Wildfish twice and I've been extremely happy with my meals and the service.  Eventually, I hope to sample everything on the menu.  Until then, I will recommend what I've tried thus far:  the Cashew Calamari is to-die-for!  I don't think it gets any better than this.  I really could have skipped my entree and just feasted on this appetizer alone.  Maybe next time?  Not to be outdone, the Chilean sea bass was cooked perfectly.  I believe it was simmered in some sort of broth.  It was moist and flavorful and not at all salty (big plus).  Wildfish makes a crab fried rice that is divine.  I've also tried the Wildfish Chopped salad which comes with an assortment of crab, shrimp and yummy vegetables.  For dessert (yes, I broke down), I recommend the pineapple upsidedown cake.  Talk about reviving an old-school classic!  It was served with a butter pecan ice cream, as well as whipped cream.  Wonderful!  Aside from the food, the service is always impeccable.  Both times I've visited, the general manager has made a point to stop by the table to ensure that everything is perfect.  The wait staff is attentive and helpful too, especially with questions about the extensive wine menu.

Dinner was delicious!  The appetizers, or small plates, as they are referred to on the menu, offered interesting possibilities.  I recommend the fritto misto - a combo of calamari, rock shrimp and zucchini - fantastic!  The beet salad was also quite delicious.  For my entree, I chose the lobster risotto.  It was tasty, though a tad bit salty.  Admittedly, I have some regrets about having such a rich dinner, but that was my bad, not a reflection on the restaurant lol.     I loved the decor and vibe at Olive & Ivy.  It's a trendy Scottsdale restaurant, for sure, but it didn't have that pretentious air about it.  I found the waiter very attentive and helpful with questions about the menu and area.  I guess I'm a real fan of the Fox concept restaurants.  I've enjoyed all the ones I've visited, thus far.

I love this concept:  healthy breakfast/brunch/lunch on-the-go.  I tried D'lish this morning for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised.  I wasn't expecting much from a drive-through establishment but they delivered a hot, yummy breakfast, coupled with a chai latte that was probably the best I've had to date!  Don't go expecting the speed of fast food drive-through.  You will wait a bit but it's worth it because the food is that much better.  I tried the breakfast burrito with chicken sausage, wrapped in a warm whole wheat tortilla.  I enjoyed it.  What makes me happy is that there are several other breakfast and lunch items that look appealing to me so I know a repeat visit is in my future.

I'm suprised by the negative reviews of this place.  I'm a first-timer, so I can't compare it to the restaurant of old, but I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch.  I had the combo consisting of an organic ceasar salad and a slice of the spinach and mushroom pizza.  Both were amazing!  I'm not a fan of ice cold lettuce in my salads.  The temperature of the salad was perfect.  The dressing had a nice flavor and wasn't over done.  The pizza was delicious, left me wanting another slice.  I also enjoyed my organic pomegranate limeade.  Though it was poured from a can, I'd never seen this beverage option before.  Tasty!  I really appreciated the attentiveness of the server.  She was super friendly and even offered me reading material, as I was dining alone.  I'm definitely a fan of Picazzo's.  Repeat.

I wandered into Chloe's Corner because it was in a convenient location and I was starving.  Admittedly, I wasn't expecting much.  It's cute but it looks like a standard deli, chalkboard menus and all.  I was pleasantly surprised with my lunch.  I already know the hot smoked turkey sandwich will haunt my dreams...smoked turkey breast, havarti and tomato on cranberry walnut bread.  Pure deliciousness.    The menu had several other items - sandwiches, salads and soups that sound tempting.  This place certainly draws a crowd during the peak lunch hour but they seem to move quickly.  I didn't have to wait long for my meal.  Another plus, the prices were surprisingly reasonable. I do believe I've found a new lunch spot in North Scottsdale.

Stax has become my favorite Old Town lunch spot and I'm not usually a burger type of gal.  The food here is really good.  I love the variety of burgers (veggie, turkey, kobe, exotic, etc) and the fact that you can select the size you want.  This is great for sampling.  Also, I am a fan of any place that serves sweet potatoes.  Here, you get your choice of sweet potato fries or sweet potato tots.  I call that heaven!  I understand the "regular" fries and tots are tasty, as well.  Though, I've only visited Stax for lunch, I noticed that they have what appears to be a full-service bar.  They also have a kid friendly menu...truly something for everyone here.

I was compelled to try Fresh Mint based on its healthy and appetizing menu.  I am happy to report that I wasn't disappointed.  While the pictures on the internet led me to believe the restaurant was more upscale, it was a clean and cozy space located in one of Scottsdale's many strip malls.  I started off dinner with an appetizer of cucumber rolls - light and tasty.  For my entree, I tried the curry apple tofu with brown rice.  It was flavorful and filling.  The portion size was just right.   Against my better judgment (as I mentioned, the entree was filling), I went in for dessert.  The coconut mango tapioca could have been skipped.  The flavor was okay but the consistency was runny for my tastes.  Overall, I found Fresh Mint delightful.  The owner was extremely attentive and personable.  I will definitely return when I'm in town.

My second visit to Eddie's House was even better than the first.  The restaurant has an original menu with delectable twists!  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and the service.  I try my best to stay away from bread before the meal but this place makes that impossible.  I haven't figured out the secret to the butter/pesto combination served with the warm bread here but it is incredible.  If you want to overdose on carbs, this is the way to go out!    For dinner I had the fetoush salad and the chilean sea bass, served with broccoli.  Everything was absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to get back.

I stopped in for dinner last night based on the menu I found on the web.  I was very attracted to the healthy options listed.  Unfortunately, I passed over the salads and ordered the Number Two pizza.  It wasn't bad.  It also wasn't particularly memorable.  I suppose I'd try it again, in a pinch.  What will keep me away from this location is the staff.  I'd sure hate to see them during a lunch rush hour.  When I visited, there were only two customers in line and they seemed dazed and confused.  I stood at the counter for about five minutes (directly in front of two staffers) without being acknowledged.  Finally, one looks at me as to ask what I was doing there.  I don't believe he ever asked if he could help but I gave him my order, nonetheless.  There was a repeat scenario once I reached the cashier.  While waiting for my pizza to bake, another employee comes over to apologize about the wait on my tortilla soup.  I didn't order any soup.  Let me repeat that there were only two other customers in line during my visit.  The staff was unenthusiastic and seriously lacked customer service.  Everyone is entitled to an off day but this was ridiculous.   I won't reurn.

This store is the smallest location I've visited.  That aside, it is clean,  well-stocked and organized.  I appreciated the fact that it was never uncomfortably crowded during the lunch hour.  This was great because I had lunch here three days in a row!  Obviously, I'm a fan.  They have a nice salad bar.  Again, not as many options as I've seen at other locations BUT solid.  They rotate the ingredients daily too.  This kept me out of my salad rut...spinach one day, spring mix the next.  Everything is kept fresh and is not picked over.

First of all, I'm immediately intrigued by any place that has roasted beets AND caramel corn on the menu (as separate dishes, mind you).  Culinary Dropout is not your typical restaurant.  The menu items are creative but not so far out that the food isn't enjoyable.  I loved the crispy shrimp ceasar salad.  They include kale and lemon zest for an interesting twist.  And yes, I tried the roasted beets and caramel corn.  Both were delicious!  As for the decor - meh.  Its appeal is missed on me.  However, I did appreciate the friendly wait staff with their colorful tatoos and piercings.  I liked the fact that the restaurant tries to be different.  It does it well.

I will start by saying:   I'm no tea connoisseur.  I stopped at Tea Time to purchase a gift for a friend.  The shop boasts a wide variety of teas and, without being well-versed in the product; I'd guess that it's pretty high quality stuff. My issues aren't with the tea.  My friend informed me that he absolutely loves what I selected and everything tastes delicious.  Perhaps my expectations were unrealistic.  I fancied a warm and cozy tea shop with friendly staff that would help me select teas and maybe even give me a sip or two of what the store has to offer. That's not what materialized. As the only customer in the shop at the time, I had to wait until the two sales ladies finished their non-work related conversation to get noticed. One completely ignored me during my entire visit. She was too busy flipping her hair and stomping around in her stilettos to give as much as a smile. The sales lady who finally assisted me was nice enough. She seemed to know a little about tea but I had to guide the entire interaction. I was hoping that a shop that sells nothing but tea could offer some guidance, a starting point, something!  After asking to sniff a few teas, I finally selected a few for purchase. I was asked if I wanted gift wrap and I agreed since I'd already informed her that I was purchasing the tea for someone else. In my mind, I'm thinking that's awfully nice of her. What she neglected to mention is that they charge for their gift box and tissue paper. I didn't notice this until I looked at the receipt after leaving the store. I could have gone to Walgreen's and got a nice gift bag for less money.   At the end of the day, I'm happy my friend loves his tea. However, I find Tea Time cold and unwelcoming, not at all the friendly and cozy tea spot I'd hoped for.  Bottom line:  NOT my cup of tea!

Delicious!  Both the savory and sweet crepes are hits.  I don't normally indulge in dessert at lunchtime but I couldn't resist.  After devouring the veggie crepe (yum) I split the Tutti Fruiti with my dining companion.  Pure heaven.  It helps that the service here is attentive and friendly.  Such an adorable family-run spot.  I will definitely return.

Great discovery for me!  I popped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  I had the best veggie tacos ever!  They were extremely flavorful and filling.  I don't know the secret to the accompanying rice and beans but they were also on point...just delicious!  The only drawback is the size of the place.  Since I dined alone, I sat at the bar.  It wasn't the most comfortable seating but I'd do it again in a heartbeat for those spicy veggie tacos.  I will definitely return to Fuego Tacos.

Stopped in for dinner Sunday night.  This was my first visit to True Food Kitchen.  Wow!  I'm sold.  It took me forever to decide what to order because so many of the items on the menu were appealing.  The beverage menu (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) was impressive.  Lots of fancy and healthful options.  I ended up with the turkey burger, kale salad and sweet potato hash.   Everything was tasty.  The restaurant draws the trendy, hip-cool crowd.  It was a little loud and had a long wait.  Fortunately, I by-passed that and took a seat at the bar.  I'm so glad I did.  I had the best service I've experienced in a long while.  The bartender who waited on me was AWESOME.  He could teach a class in how it should be done.  I'd return just to tip him again.  Thankfully, I loved my meal too.

You probably have to be a lover of red meat to fully appreciate all that Rehab Burger Therapy offers.  I do not fit into that category but I'm a fan, nonetheless.  They have a pretty tasty turkey burger.  When you add all the 'fixin's', some fries and an ice cold beer; it makes for a darn good meal!  What stands out even more than the food, in my opinion, is the service.  I can't recall having more genuinely friendly service.  John is awesome and made sure I was well taken care of during my visit; however, everyone in the vicinity greeted me warmly and chatted me up as I ate.  I appreciated that, as I dined alone at the bar.    The menu has a variety of items that sound tempting.  It is definitely worth a return visit.

I didn't have an opportunity to try a full sized cake but the red velvet bundlett was divine...super moist and not overly sweet.  I love the fact that you can buy these mini-sized cakes - they're still shareable and reasonably priced $4 - $5.  Service was friendly and the store is super cute and clean.  Since I want to be able to fit into my clothing, I can't stop in too often when visiting Phoenix but I will make it a point to come back to try more flavors.
