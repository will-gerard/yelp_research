I only come here for the natural lemonades (not sure how natural they truly are, but the strawberry lemonade is divine!). The staff is always very friendly.

I work right around the corner from the doctors office. Several of the people in our office rave about Dr. Patel. Cursed with a sinus infection that's lasted over a week, I decided to visit their office to see if they were excepting new patients. I was told they were and that they could fit me in later this afternoon, so then I asked if they accepted  my insurance. When I was told they did not, I told them I would self-pay so I could be seen today still. Dr. Patel came out and told me he was too busy to see me and I had to go to my assigned doctor. I told him I didn't want to go through my insurance and I don't have an assigned doctor since I haven't been to one in over 2 years, and definitely not since being forced to get on an Obama care approved plan. I just wanted to pay out-of-pocket. Again I was told that they could not see me because i had to go to my approved doctor and they were too busy.   It was extremely frustrating as all I wanted to do was get an antibiotic. Obamacare sucks.

Pretty delicious breakfast burritos. Checked in on Yelp and got free chips and salsa! Score!

We've been taking my daughter to Timber Falls for several years now and they have been so wonderful with her. Dr. Quakenbush and the hygenists are so gentle and kind to her, she actually enjoys her visits. Plus, she loves getting a treasure out of the chest, and playing in the log cabin in the waiting area.

I've lived less than a mile from this place for 3+ years and I'm just now finding out about it?  WTH?   Searching for good, quick Mexican food shouldn't be hard, but I'm so over Filiberto's, so took a quick glance at Yelp and stumbled upon this place. After looking at the photos of the food, it was a no-brainer.   Chheng L.'s photo of the 1/2 carne 1/2 carnitas was what did it for me. Call me a copy cat, but I'm pretty sure I ordered exactly what was pictured and I'm SO glad I did. It was amazing!    Let me just say that the burritos are HUGE. The couple in front of us ordered several, and they stuffed one so much, they had to re-wrap it because the tortilla wasn't big enough!   We ordered 2 burritos and 1 veggie tostada. Out the door for under $15. Nice.    We will definitely be here again!

Unfortunately, I don't actually have any first hand experience dealing with this company. I found them online when researching a mobile petting zoo for my daughter's upcoming birthday.  I left a voicemail and email 12 days ago requesting more information on their availability, and still have not received any communication from them.    Not a company I want to depend on to show up to my child's party on time, or at all!  Not worth the risk.

We have rented at Noah's for our sales meetings as well as corporate holiday parties. We've only used the Main Hall and the Medium Conference Room. The facilities are beautiful and well-maintained.  We love the fact that we can bring in our own food, as we have vendors that sponsor our events and use catering from outside companies. This alone, compared to hotels in the area and other spaces that can accommodate our large group, is worth the price. Food at hotel meeting spaces runs $19pp and up, so the fact we can bring our own saves us and our sponsors hundreds and hundreds of dollars.    Are only complaint is that their technology is crap. The HDMI cables we use for presentations during our meetings rarely work. We've given up trying to use their wireless lapel mics which are useless.  Also, when you have 80 people trying to use wi-fi during the meeting, it's extremely unreliable.  We've been told they were updating everything, but I don't see a difference.  We now bring our own cables, mics, PA system, etc. as a workaround.  They've recently raised their rates, which is understandable, and luckily we are repeat monthly customers for almost 2 years now so we're offered a discount. The pricing is still as good as surrounding properties.

Ran by here after shopping nearby and was looking for something other than fast food drive thru. Glad we stopped. Was debating between the hummus pita and the Chicago Gyro (thanks to other Yelpers photos and reviews). Went with the Chicago. Ordered to go, waited about 4 minutes, and the friendly cashier brought it over to me. It was loaded full of beef and lamb. I had requested they add hummus spread, which was divine. Overall, I prefer more veggies than meat, but the meat was tender and delish so I overlooked it. The tzatziki sauce was pretty good too.  Wish it would've come with lettuce or something else, but the onions and peppers were tasty.  Will be here again to try the hummus wrap next time. Prices were decent too for the amount of food you receive.

Called here on a whim looking for an inexpensive place for a child's mani / pedi which ended up being $22. SOLD! We drove down and were helped in no time. I opted for a gel mani while I waited... also $22. All of the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. The place was clean. Will definitely come back for our next pamper session.

Ordered online at this location and was told my order (2 footlong meals and 1 footlong) would be ready in 15 minutes. I arrived 17 minutes later, pulled through to the drive through and told her I was picking up an online order. I was told the order was just printed, go park and come inside to wait while they "pounded out" my order.  I backed out of the driveway and pulled in to a spot. Waited in the car about 5 minutes checking emails and giving them time to make my sandwich (since I was the only car in the parking lot, I figured that'd be ample time). Went in and was told by Katie they were working on my order right now and I could see 2 of the footlongs were on the counter, bread open with no toppings yet.  What had they been doing for the 5 minutes I was in the car??  Finally, I was told everything was ready and Katie apologized profusely and added a 3rd drink and chip free.  30 minutes after placing my order, it was finally ready. Lucky for me, they had some reality show on TV that kept me occupied.  When I got home, the subs weren't even labeled. Not a huge deal, but when you have 3 footlongs and hungry boys to feed, it gets messy trying to figure out whose sub is whose.  Been to this location several times since it offers online ordering and has a drive thru. Usually there is some sort of mix up on the toppings. After reading other reviews, it appears this is normal.  I would have given 3 stars for customer service alone thanks to Katie trying to make the order right, but the whole point of online ordering is to not have to wait.   Will head to the Az Ave and Warner location for future orders.

Took our Jeep in to upgrade the stock radio to something with bluetooth. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The day following our install, the "cubby" under the stereo face plate started making this obnoxious rattling noise at all speeds.  Made a quick call to the shop and was told to bring it by anytime to be fixed, no appt necessary. After adding some foam padding, noise is gone.  Will remember these guys for any future car audio needs.   Prompt, courteous, and fair pricing.

After needing to trench our front yard to replace our main sewer line in February, by June I had lived with a dirt yard long enough.  Oh, and we were having a petting zoo party coming to our house in mid-July so we needed some landscaping pronto!  After getting quotes from several companies off of Thumbtack and not being overly impressed with them, I turned to Yelp and found Eduardo and crew with KO's Landscape.  He was knowledgeable, friendly, and had great suggestions for plants, etc.   Pricing was fair and he and his crew were done when promised.  We've since have had him back out to replace one plant that didn't make it in the heat, and to adjust the drips system as a few other plants weren't looking so hot.   Easy peasy, no hassle.   KO's under promises and over delivers!   His return communication is prompt!  We will be in touch with them again when I get sick of the dirt in the backyard next (very soon!)

Great food, friendly staff. Strawberry Peach White Sangria was wonderful and refreshing. The Popper sandwich was tasty and crispy. With a side of garlic fries (which are huge and enough to share), it was the perfect meal and had plenty of leftovers. Hubs had the blue cheese burger and slammed that down in no time.  Sundae was a big hit with the little one.   Service was great up until the food was delivered. Refills weren't offered , and we were done eating for about 15 minutes before our waitress eventually stopped by our table to ask if we wanted the check.   It was a Friday night and they were busy, but our waitress walked by many times without stopping. We had empty plates and drinks on the table and no one was actively eating, so it should've been obvious we were done.   Other than the wait for the check, nothing turned us off from eating here again. We will definitely come back to try some of their other signature drinks.

So delicious and for the kid who doesn't like Mexican food ( i think she was switched at birth!), they have hamburgers that satisfy her. Love their bowls with carne and the grilled corn is to die for! Bought 3 $7 vouchers and look forward to using them up quickly!  Only complaint is the semi slow service. They make everything custom to order so it takes a bit longer but totally worth the wait.

Deliciousness at its finest!  Have someone in your party arrive early to get on the list, otherwise you'll be waiting awhile for a table.  After being seated and ordering, food arrives quickly and customized to your liking.    I ordered the medium on my veggies but they were quite spicy. If you don't like a lot of spice, go with mild or the butter sauce.   Everything is a la carte, but portions of the side dishes are definitely large enough to share with several people.  No kids menu to speak of, so our daughter got dessert for dinner....not a bad thing in her eyes.    Service was excellent

This place is right down the street from us and we were looking for something quick and easy for dinner. The owner and staff are super friendly. We had our 5 year old with us so they gave her a paper plate to draw on (which they later hung up on the wall) and the chalkboard table was open so she was entertained with that, as well as watching the gentleman behind the window tossing and making the braided crust.  Pizza was delicious as was the beer in the chilled mason jar mugs.  We'll definitely be back!

Called in an order for pick up, was ready as soon as I walked in approx 10 mins later. Staff was friendly. Ordered the  steak protein bowl with sweet potato hash and seasonal blood orange lemonade. Tasty and enough food to save leftovers for lunch the next day.  Love the environmentally friendly packaging as well.

What a bargain this place is! First time here and sad I am only now discovering it. $10 to play all day and a quiet cafe area (they serve beer) for parents, this can't be beat. Went with a playgroup and the kids never got bored. I think we were here for approx 5 hours. Food is well priced too and kid's meals are large enough to fill them up. I love that they check your wristbands on the way out.

We signed up for a trial lesson to see if our 5 year old would like it. She loved it so we signed up for once a week lessons. She's starting a bit late in life but fits in well with the grasshoppers. She adores her teacher, Miss Leanne, and enjoys the other girls as well. Most the girls on her class are approx her age or slightly younger. Grouped by skill level. Besides a mix up with our payment for the original sign up, everything has been going great and we'll continue going here until the kid decides she's done.

Great place for family fun. A bit small (though 18 holes) but can't beat the air condition in the summer. Our 6 year old has a blast charging the balls throughout the course. Took about 30 minutes to play a full round with 2 golfers and waiting on others to play through. Went on a Sunday afternoon around 12 and wasn't very busy which was nice. They had a private party room too that looks really cool!

If you're looking for fast food, this is definitely not it. Our order of 3 burgers took about 15 minutes to get. This was not a big deal to us, but just want to make it clear this isn't a fast food joint (not by my standards, at least).    The burgers are nice and large, perfectly cooked, and delicious.  Fries were a little too seasoned for me, but I like my fries pretty plain and where I don't have to wipe salt off my fingers after every bite.  This is really the only reason I didn't go with the 5 stars.  The menu is pretty plain. From what I could tell you can either get a hamburger or a hot dog. You can add whatever toppings you'd like to either. However, I didn't spend much time perusing the menu, as we were looking for Burgers to begin with.  If you're going at night, be aware that they have a temporary sign/banner that is covering a neon sign. At night time, you can't read the Bing's Burger sign at all. All you can see is the neon sign underneath which is says Fresh Days. Anyways, just go to the far east side of the complex and it's in the corner suite next to the church. If you take the driveway off of Cooper that goes between Discount Tires and Bahama Bucks, go straight all the way back and you'll run in to it. Don't drive around aimlessly looking for it like someone else on Yelp may or may not have done.  ;)  Definitely worth a stop here.

Crumbly buns and soggy zucchini fries.....enough said.   I don't know how they justify charging so much when the food is mediocre at best.  The only redeeming feature was being seated immediately on a Saturday afternoon.

I can't really speak to the product, as we haven't ordered our mattress yet, but definitely plan to in the near future. We stopped by the downtown Phoenix store on a Saturday morning to be greeted by a line of customers waiting to sign in. The employees at the front who were assisting were super friendly, offering cold Fiji waters to those in line, as well as offering assistance to those signing in on the computers.  With the amount of people in the showroom, we were expecting a 10 minute wait. We signed in, sat down in the waiting area, and were called back no more than 3 minutes later. Amber was so helpful and friendly, calling our daughter by name, offering stickers. We were taken to our private room with sliding barn door (genius! It's so awkward to lay on mattresses in other stores where people are walking by and watching!) where Amber explained about TN and answered any questions we had. She also ended up  giving us a few extra minutes in the room to truly feel the mattress out.  You really can't go wrong with their customer service and return policy (100 days! IF you don't like it, they ask you to donate it to charity!  Awesome!). Again, we haven't bought this mattress yet, but based on reviews from Amazon and the web, I'm pretty confident they stand by their product.   Will update our review once we have the actual mattress in our home. Can't wait!

Found Walking M Farms through Facebook and sought them out as a back up to the original mobile petting zoo we had hired for our daughter's birthday party. When the original zoo was non-responsive as our date drew nearer, I reached out to Walking M Farms to firm up the date. Though a bit more expensive, they were extremely professional and provided great communication up to and throughout the event date. We cancelled our original zoo and hired WMF.   Everyone, including the adults, had a great time.  We had a pair of ducks, pair of chickens, pigs, sheep, goats, and a silk chicken at our farm, and they were delightful.   Thanks, Walking M Farms!

We bought a Living Social for this place and were excited to try it out. The atmosphere is funky and fun.   We ordered the T-bucket Sampler (fries, onion rings, carnitas quesadilla, mini chimis, chicken fingers)  and the 2 tacos (carnitas and centerfold). The food was delicious and their prickly pear bbq sauce is delish! The bucket was HUGE and had plenty of food for the two of us. We had enough leftovers just from the bucket for another complete meal.  The waiter was extremely friendly and attentive. Service was quick. Our waiter even offered us a to-go drink for the road which I LOVE!  We will be back!

I have never worked in fast food before, so I'm not sure how the whole drive thru order system works. I've never been somewhere where they are constantly screwing up the order, trying to give me food I didn't order, or drinks that I didn't order. Sure, everyone has their days, but this seems to be consistent with this location. The older lady working the drive-through window in the mornings is constantly confused as to what you have ordered. If there were a location more convenient to me, I would definitely be visiting Them

Pulling up, the parking lot was packed so I opted for the drive-through. There are two drive-through lanes and one was free. It took less than five minutes from the time I place my order, to the time I had my 3 boxed dinners and was driving off. Placing my order was easy as the menu is very well organized and the order taker asked specifically for the side, mild or spicy, sauce (sweat heat is to die for!) and drink.    The food was tasty. My 6 yr old who is an extremely picky eater, even enjoyed the popcorn shrimp (she may or may not have been told it was chicken) but said it was a bit spicy (I guess for a 6 yr old it may have been). The chicken tenders and bone in chicken were both good. Had the cajun fries, mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes.   Priced comparable to Church's but we will definitely drive out of our way to go to Popeyes (about 4 Miles from us) instead of Church's (about 1/2 mile away) since they got our order right (something Church's never can accomplish)

Holy smokes. Don't go here at lunch if you don't have more than 30 minutes for your break. The line was to the door. Luckily, we ordered online for pick up and were able to bypass the long line (only after consulting with the nice young man who was at the door welcoming guests who then had to ask another employee what proper protocol is). This was my first time to a Firehouse Subs and I chose the Philly steak. It was large and filling, the pickle was perfectly sour.  The steak was tender and the sauteed onions were perfect.
