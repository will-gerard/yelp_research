Since moving from Tucson I have been in search for an authentic Sonora hot dog. Mickey's is the closest have come across. Well worth the trip into Mesa a couple times a month to get my fix!

menudo menudo menudo...no I am not talking about the 80s Latin group but this hidden restaurant on University. To be honest I would have have stopped had my friend not took me there.  Small place about 12 tables inside. I almost felt like I was at my aunts house waiting for her to bring me food. Sunday menudo red or white!

These guys know what they are doing when it comes to glass. Had my house window replace and was so happy I had my windshield replaced months later when it had a crack. Great price and good service.

Nothing short of amazing. I was impressed with the atmosphere from the second I walked it with the love music. When I heard about the Pomegranate Guacamole, my first thought was another booshie spin on a classic Mexican dish. Needless to say I was blown away. They had an amazing selection of tequila and drinks I order a Victoria even thou it wasn't on the menu. Considering it just became available in Phoenix this year I understood.  For my main course I choose Tacos de Cochinita Pibil. Normally I am left still hungry when ordering a taco platter this is not the case with these small tacos stuff with all this with wonderful ingredients fresh and flavorful. Great service, great food and great ambiance have made Barrio Cafe my new weekly must go place!

Always an amazing time on Saturday Nights. Amazing staff that understands how to treat a customer. It nice to find a place in Scottsdale that plays Hip-Hop and still has a dress code. A hidden gem with beautiful ladies!

This should be your only stop when in downtown phoenix for drinks and food. Before or after a D-Backs or Suns game or any other event. Great drinks, live DJ playing music in the background all around fun place from the elevator shaft to the restrooms. I recommend any pizza.

I had heard so many good things about this place and me being a Taco Lover I had to see for myself. I was disappointed from the beginning. Came on a Tuesday and was told we had to wait but that we could get drinks at the bar. Sounded like a good idea until 20mins later we had yet to be help after asking for a waitress and even going to the bar several times.  When we finally got a table I was more than excited to order. Nothing but average through out my experience. I would have been better off going to Americans Taco Shop.

Honestly the best place to listen to HipHop music in Scottsdale. Nice looking crowd, great music and amazing staff. I couldn't believe how big it was inside.
