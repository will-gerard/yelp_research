I moved from Charlotte almost 2 months ago and I miss Greek Isles. In the two years that I lived in Uptown I must have visited here about 6-7 times and I didn't discover the restaurant for almost 6 months after moving to CLT it was also my last meal before I moved to the midwest. Faves- you can't go wrong with the Taste of Greece. If you like lamb, the Youvesti is definitely well worth it. The butter they serve with the bread is so tasty- its a homemade garlic/herb/onion flavor. The horiatiki salads are amazing, incredibly fresh! The loukamades are just outstanding. All of their dishes are reasonably priced. Service can be a bit spotty at times, but all in all a great place that I miss!

I haven't been here in over a year, but this place was awful. The staff was horrible. Every time I would go I would get the hard sell to the point where I would actually leave. There was one creepy guy who kept repeating my name whenever I would go there in conversation. The store is decent, but no...

I would stay here again. It's not perfect but I think we got good value for our money. To Brian F... I got cocktail service in the casino and I was with one other girl. I'm surprised that a guy wasn't getting served at the casino.  The first thing I noticed was the cheesy butterfly decorations hanging from the ceiling and that, ugh you can smoke in public places in Nevada : ( All of that aside, we got an upgraded room on the 30th floor that was quite large. It was clean and modern and the bed and pillows were AMAZING.  The casino was really nice, it's not as bustling as Caesar's or Bellagio, but that was fine. The patisserie near the elevators was a major guilty pleasure with the gelato (they do samples) and crepes. The restaurants are ok. The Aria Cafe was better than we expected as was American Fish, but BarMasa is an epic fail.  The location is great, I don't think the tram is really value add because it goes from Bellagio to Aria and at times, I thought it would have been faster to take the Strip.

Really wanted to like this place... we stayed in Verona for the night before we drove further north. I knew from the reviews that this place had the vibe we were looking for- and would be cyclist friendly. I wasn't wrong, they are biker friendly but the food was just so disappointing.  It's a cafe with a knick knack shop and a toddler play area in it. Fine. We came for food and caffeine. The menu seemed to have some good stuff on it and there were definitely people coming in for drinks. We were hungry so we ordered two breakfast burritos. Not sure if they were short staffed, but once I saw the burrito and the microwave set up I got nervous.  We waited and waited and finally got breakfast. The burritos were terrible. I understand that they don't have a full kitchen and that it wouldn't exactly be fresh made but they were bad and  I regret spending the money. The tea and coffee were fine. The wait was just odd. No thanks.

Let me save you a lot of trouble and a lot of $$$$. Do not eat here.  My friend picked this place since we were staying at the Aria and we could eat small plates style and then move on. Sadly she did not check the yelp reviews. It was August so I didn't think too much of it when I saw the dining room was basically empty, but I think people just know this place is terrible. The dining room is ugly too.  I was shocked at the prices. I know there's a markup for the resort but this is highway robbery. In response to Rod U.'s review, I ordered the lobster risotto and I don't consider that Japanese cuisine and it was the size of a Dixie cup. For $28 (or $38 with shaved white truffles) I expect a least 2 Dixie cups. I had a cold lobster appetizer as well which was excellent. My friend got the restaurant week menu (~$32) and laughed at it when it was presented. She got the steak and it was something you would expect on a children's menu. The presentation was beautiful and the food tastes good, but after the 2 of us spent $130 on food (no alcohol) we had to leave because we were still hungry and getting terrible value for the money. We might as well have put that money in a slot machine. We complained to a person on the staff who refilled our water and cleared dishes. He said it wasn't the first time he had heard something say that.  We left for Caesar's because we knew Mesa Grill would feed us properly. Pretty sad when 2 thin girls have to eat 2 dinners.

This was my first Michael Mina experience. I was a little sketpical at frist seeing that even a fish entree was over $40. The restaurant is inside the Aria, just past the buffet but before Jean Georges. It's a smaller place with wood planeling and an exposed kitchen which was neat to watch.  I was there the last week of August which happened to be restuarant week. I normally steer clear of restuarant week menus but there were so many tasty things to choose from I couldn't have picked just one off the regular menu. For $90 I definitely got my fill and I did the extra $45 for wine pairing.  Very tasty. Some of my favorites were the tuna tartare, the mustard baked cod (literally melted in my mouth!), a steak dish and on and on. Yummy. My friend got the bacon wrapped trout which she loved. Not to be outdone, we also got the truffle mac and cheese which was surprisingly good and I'm not a mac and cheese fan.  Our server, Shannon, took good care of us and the sommelier was very friendly and helpful. This place is $$$$. The lobster pot pie looked amazing (although that copper pot is about 1/3 full at best) and was $85 the night we were there, but probably wouldn't have filled me up. You're partially paying for the location inside Aria, but I thought this was a special meal all the way around.

I haven't been there in sometime but this was my staple lunch go-to for many many months. It can get crowded and hectic during the lunch hour and when it's cold outside the end of the line will be by the door for sure. This is the best fast food Mexican I've ever had. So much that when I moved to Chicago I went to the Salsarita's website to ask for one to come to Chicago. Not one here yet. This is so much better than Qdoba and Burrito Beach. For starters you can eat somewhat healthy here. I used to order 3 hard tacos with shrimp, lettuce, tomato, cilantro, and onion (do this instead of the pico to avoid the added salt) and it was so good. If I had room to splurge in my diet I would add guacamole. When I was having a really crappy day I would get nachos loaded with everything and they would taste amazing.  I don't get to the Queen City much anymore, but when I fly through Charlotte I make sure to go to the one at Douglas airport. Tip: the one in the E concourse has hard shell tacos, the one in the main concourse does not!
