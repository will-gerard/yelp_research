This place is awful! I Would NEVER recommend this place!   My sister bought me a Groupon for this place as a Christmas gift because my desk job was giving me upper back, and neck pain. The Groupon voucher was for "One spinal decompression package: one exam, five x-rays, five decompressions, and five sessions of soft-tissue work"   My first visit was with Dr. Wong. He took a quick look, and moved my neck around a few times to see my mobility. Then he took a few X-Rays, and told me to come back in a few days. They literally did nothing about my pain. My neck, and shoulders actually hurt worse after the first exam from him bending me around.   My second visit was with Dr. Kovac. This guy is like a high pressure car salesman. He reviewed my x-rays with me, and told me I needed his long term program to repair my neck. Kovac's quote was extremely high. Over double what my new chiropractor charges!! When I told him that I wanted to think things over, and get back to him he became more aggressive. Kovac said to me, "You want to shop around on me? This is your neck we're talking about. That's the supidist idea I have ever heard. Nobody shops me." He then walked me out of his office, and I never received any decompression or soft-tissue work.   My new chiropractor is a million times better than this place. They didn't pressure me at all to go on their program. They took better x-rays, did better tests, actually gave me an alignment, decompression, and a massage. I felt immediate relief after my first visit. To top it off, my first visit cost half as much as the Groupon "deal" that my sister bought me.

I needed a Sweet Acacia removed and a Palo Verde trimmed. The Sweet Acacia was shedding all over my yard and into my neighbors yard. Both trees were also dripping sap into my driveway and on any car that was parked under them. I contacted about 5 other companies. Conrad came out and gave me a  fair quote within the next day. I believed I called on a Wednesday and Conrad's team was able to come out to do the work on Saturday. There was only one other company that gave me a lower bid, but they put me at the bottom of their schedule on Friday. They failed to show up on time so I canceled on them. I decided to go with Conrad and his team. They did a fantastic job. It looks like the Sweet Acacia was never even there and on top of everything they cleaned my whole front yard. (My yard was NASTY before they came, and it looks great now.) I will definitely use Chip Off the Old Block again in the future!

Paul did a lot of work for me on my Civic Si. The finish date had to be extended because the damage on my car turned out to be more than we thought, but over all PCC did a great job. He kept communication, and even sent me pictures to keep me updated. I will definitely do business here again.
