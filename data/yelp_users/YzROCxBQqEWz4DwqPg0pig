Great bar with a staff that is friendly and welcoming. Clientele is open to conversation with strangers and there always seems to be something going on.

The music they played on the speakers was to loud to hold a conversation over - then they turn it off for live music that was impossible to speak over.  Good place to go if you are with people you don't want to talk to.
