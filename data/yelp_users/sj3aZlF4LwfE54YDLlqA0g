Large portions, well priced, standard hole in the wall Chinese restaurant. The General Tso's chicken is delicious, so is the chicken with broccoli, and I love how the Mongolian Beef has a little kick to it. The fried rice is so so, but the Egg drop soup and Hot and Sour Soups are quite tasty.   I am docking a star, because it is dirty inside of there and the tables are sticky. It's also very small inside of there, with a limited drink selection.  However, for I think's 5.75 at lunch, you can get Pork fried rice, a large helping of General Tso's chicken, and your choice of soup. By the time I get done eating lunch I need a siesta, most of the time I can't finish all the food and usually need to get a Monster or something else to stay awake the last half of my day.

The staff here is friendly and helpful with fantastic food. The portions are extremely filling and tasty. I am a huge fan of their Lo Mein, it is fantastic. Their fried pork egg rolls are huge and is a meal all by itself. The food comes quickly and inside it is very clean and tidy. Excellent tasting fried rice and their tofu is amazing. I am not a fan of tofu, but the way they cook it I will find myself ordering the Hot Korean or Spicy Szechuan with Tofu instead of chicken or beef. Well worth your time and money. The owner is usually there to greet you and asks how your meal was and how your day is going.

Red Robin is generally a good place to get a burger, fries and shake. They have excellent onion rings, which is my favorite appetizer to get. The service is usually really good and the burgers are mighty tasty. I enjoy eating here as does my family. I have never had bad service or a bad burger.   For a chain restaurant they do have great burgers and an excellent selection of them. I like their protein burger and that it comes with a salad instead of fries. Tragically it doesn't come with unlimited salad. I am also a huge fan of their bacon chesseburger. Their Royal red robin is fantastic, but afterwards I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. They still have unlimited fries. It's a more upscale Fuddruckers with better burgers.  I've never sat at the bar so I can't comment on that. However, everywhere else is very family friendly. I enjoy when the wait staff gets together to sing a birthday song. It always makes me think of Waiting, hopefully I never get the dreaded THUMBS DOWN at any restaurant I eat at.  All in all its a sit down chain burger joint. You get what you expect, good burgers friendly wait staff, nothing AMAZING but still worth your money and time. It's also conveniently located to where I live.

I love this place, great and amazing prices with decent quality sushi. I always get Dragon Rolls and Rainbow rolls when I come here. I usually have to request them and they always taste great. Not the best, but considering its 2 dollars for 4 pieces of a dragon roll, that is a screaming dea! I always put a little sriracha on my dragon rolls and a little extra eel sauce and I love'em. I work nearby and come here at least once a week. I look at this as the equivalent of fast food sushi, not the best, but still damn tasty. I and my co-workers have never gotten sick eating here. This place is only good for the sushi and haru poppers.   I do recommend ONLY sitting along the primary table area. There are two conveyor belts and they are not linked. The best and freshest sushi seems to always be by the area where they make it.  The wait staff is hit or miss, but the cooks are fantastic and cool to talk too and watch them do their thing. This is a great place to come eat as you can get back before your 1 hour lunch is over. I have only ever eaten here during lunch time between 11-1. It can be crowded but the longest wait I saw was 15 mins, during the week.

I always sit at the bar here and Brandon has been our bartender and he has done a phenomenal job. Numerous beer selections on tap including Kona Blue Wave and Goose island. As well as several San Tan beers and four peaks. My only issue with the place is the food is just always ehh.  Nothing great, however Brandon's customer service and great beera make this place a 4. My friends and I enjoyed talking about the Mcgregor loss to Diaz with him.

My freezer in my side by side GE fride was no longer producing cold air, only cool air. The inside of the freezer was starting to develop frost as well. I called Bishop and Son Home appliance repair on 1-23-16 (a Saturday). Rick was able to come out the same day, but it was going to be late in the evening. Unfortunately there was a miscommunication (my fault) and I missed him. When I called them back, I was told he could come out Sunday even though he doesn't work Sunday. Which was awesome of them. Rick came out on Sunday assessed the problem and gave me a great cost to replace the heater and thermostat in the freezer. He also cleaned the coils as well. Then he gave me some lessons on how to clean the coils myself, which I didn't even know they needed to be cleaned, lol.   Thank you Rick, I will definitely be doing business with you again!

I have been coming to the Handlebar off and on for about 2 years now. Eating here is literally like eating in your backyard at a backyard BBQ. Sitting outside under the stars with the warmers is like sitting by the fire. The decor really makes it feel like you are at home, relaxing in your own yard. The other guests are friendly and easy going. I personally love the laid back atmosphere and feeling like I am at home, without having to cook or get my own beer. :) It is small area, but this is a true family run establishment, which I definitely enjoy patronizing.   The food is fantastic (a little pricey, but delicious), they have daily specials; the rib special on Friday is my favorite, smoked rubs with mouth watering dry rub, and a side of BBQ sauce to dip it, the bark is great, everything about the ribs is NOM NOM NOM time. Their specials do tend to run out quick. So if you get there after 8 or so the special may no longer be available. Their sides are great, the potato wedges (also a Friday special) are awesome, asparagus is great (another reviewer said their veggies are soggy and they are, still tastes good...) and flavorful.  They have 20+ beers on tap. My favorite is the Gulden Drak, which comes out of a Golden Dragon lol. It's awesome to watch them pour it. They used to pour it in a nice mug only for the Gulden Drak, but now it comes in a regular glass. They also have a great wine selection, the wife is a major fan of Dr.Loosen a German Riesling and we always have to go to Total Wine and More in Gilbert to ever find it. Well they have it here and is a nice Riesling.  They have live music on the weekends, the band is an old school/old timer band and they sound great and do a great rendition of Johnny Cash.  The staff has always been friendly and they actually go out of their way to make you feel welcome and part of their family.  The owner is a nice older gentlemen who will stop at your table and just shoot the sh*t with you. His daughter in law Megan(sp?) has an excellent memory and is fun to talk to and hang out with. IE I hadn't been back in a year (I used to go every Tuesday where they had a dollar off any draft) as the people who I would go with moved away and I had just had a baby. Anyways, the wife and I went back for the first time 1-22-16 with a couple of friends. We got there between 8-830PM and they ran out of ribs, which was damned disheartening. However, Meagan came by our table and recommended the Green Chili Burger, which was fantastic, could have been a little spicier, maybe add jalapenos to is, but was still damned good and filling. It had a chipotle aioli sauce, green chilis, pepper jack cheee, and the burger was actually cooked to the level you wanted, in my case a Medium. So after eating and talking to her and have a good time. We came back last Friday 1-29-16 and Megan came by our table and remembered our names, we were like WOW! Who does that anymore? Well the Handlebar does! When I was a kid I used to watch Cheers all the time, and I did want a place where they would remember your name, and the Handlebar does! It felt awesome!  So with such a great review why am I giving it 4 out of 5 stars you ask? Well dear reader who is super patient for getting this far or is a skimmer, lol. They do not offer fountain drinks, all non-beers come in a bottle, and as such there are no free refills. So I am docking a star for that. Otherwise this really is a 5 out of 5. This is a nice gem in AJ and the only place in AJ I will eat at!

First time I have used Triple B Garage Doors. Rusty was extremely professional and was on time. My garage door was buckling in the top middle whenever it would open. Another garage door company said I would have to replace it with a new garage door. Not something I was interested in doing or able to afford. I called Triple B and Rusty looked it over and said he could put in a support strut and adjust the tension on the springs for a heck of a lot less then I was expecting, only 120. He put in the strut, readjusted the thing that pulls up the garage door, not the spring but that brace, adjusted the springs, and fixed my garage door opener. I had apparently installed it upside down and that is why the light on it wasn't glowing, lol mea culpa. He fixed that and did it all extremely fast. He did let me know that the fix would last about 3-5 years and then I would need a new garage door. Rusty stated that since only the top part had some cracking and the bottom half had nothing wrong with it, a support strut was all I needed.  SO far so good and everything has been working well. I opened and closed the darned thing 20x after he left to make sure it would continue to work. I will definitely be contacting Triple B again when I have my RV gate looked at. One corner is popping up slowly but surely every time I open it. I should get it looked at now, but like most people I wait for something to break before fixing it oh well, heh.

This was terrible, I have brought my gf here twice and both times the food was bleh and the service the second time was horrible. I last ate here back in August, so I don't recall our waiter's name but he was just awful. We ordered the bruschetta trio our last time there for our appetizer. We went with 2 of the meatballs and the ribeye. The meatballs were really good, the ribeye was subpar. Their free bread was very greasy and unappetizing. For our dinner I ordered the Mushroom, pepperoni, sausage calzone, it was ok, but was 70% mushrooms, so that was disappointing. My gf ordered the chicken alfredo, the noodles were dry, and stuck together. The sauce was congealed and the chicken rubbery. We will not be eating here or at any other Babbo's again. Olive Garden is better then this place, and that is sad.  I recommend going to Oreganos on gilbert or Bucco Di Peppo on Val Vista instead. A longer drive, but well worth your time and money.

Close to the house very low cost and better then Subway.  The sandwiches are tasty and filling.  They lose a star because their claim their meatball sub is the best in the world is false!!! My sister makes the best meatball subs I have had in the west coast, best ever was some mom and pop shop in Medford New Jersey i went to once and still dream about. Firehouse's meatball sub is still damn good with big ole fat meatballs, but still minus 1 star for not living up to the gigantic poster in the store proclaiming best meatball sub in the world.

This is the usual place my fiancé and I go to get our nails down. The new location which is right next door to the old one is larger and much nicer inside. They have replaced the massage chairs and added mote of them and increased the number of spots to get a manicure. I normally get the standard pedicue and my fiancé gets the luxury pedicure and a manicure. Gentlemen getting a pedicure is pheomenal. Its soothing and feels great. Its amazing getting pampered like this. It makes me feel like a Roman Emperor all i need is a bunch of nubile scantily clad ladies to feed me grapes to complete the feeling. I'm pretty sure it was women who started the rumor that getting a pedicure and a manicure makes you gay to keep us out of here. I felt nervous getting my first pedicure and during it i was like holy i wish i had been getting these my whole life!!  I love going here its well priced, clean, and the ladies are friendly and hard working. So come on in here and get a mani/pedi

i am going to preface this by saying I am a huge fan of cake donuts they are my favorite and I have never been in the store. So I cannot comment on their customer service, cleanliness of their store, and so on.  One of the managers at work bought 3 boxes of donuts and brought them in for us to try, all I will say is WOW adios diet these are amazing! I was being so good at resisting the donuts but everyone in the office kept saying "This is the best donut I have ever had! You have to try one!" and so on and so forth, finally I gave in to the peer pressure (I know I am weak, woe is me) and I tried one, there were only a few left so I had the Salted Caramel and sweet baby JESUS that was like Christmas in my mouth! I went NOM NOM NOM on that donut and didn't even feel bad for breaking my diet, now I need to go run for an hour to get rid of those calories. Totally worth it! In fact as I am typing this I want to get up and go get another donut....

I have been coming here since this theatre opened and it has been going downhill. Many of the seats have rips and tears in them. Usually in the arm rests, seat back, or chair it self. The prices are really high.  However, the staff is pretty good. You can bring yyour Harkins loyalty cups here for a fill up for the same price at Harkins. Also with the theatre becoming more and more ghetto  fewer people are coming here. Which is a good thing if you want awesome seating  spots in ripped chairs to see Dead Pool at 7pm for the iMAX experience. We were able to sit behind the railing and enjoyed the movie quite well. Unfortunately the speakers on the right side made some weird noises occasionally throughout the movie.  Hopefully, the owners will revamp and revitalize this theatre.   Come here to not have to wait inline for decent seats like at Harkins.

As someone who loves thin crust pizzas, this is my new place! I went with 3 co-workers for lunch to check it out and it was well worth going too. Not only do they offer amazing pizza with all the toppings you want for the same price, they also have 2 crafted beers on tap, SanTan Devil's Ale and an Orange blossom. I know the Devil's Ale is good as I have had it, as I had to go back to work after lunch, I refrained from washing my pizza down with a cold beer... I know sadface at having to be a responsible adult. So I got a drink which was 1.95, it looks like they only have one size. However, their drink choices are excellent, I made an Arnold Palmer with their Black Tea and Raspberry lemonade, it was darn good.  I had the Jasper Mod sized with pepperoni, olives, and sun dried tomatos added on it was around 11 dollars for the pizza. It was flavorful, filling, and cooked to perfection. One co-worker got the Seasonal "The Winston" some weird concoction of something with cauliflower and other items and she said it was great, it didn't look appealing to me, but she wolfed it down, it was a small. Another got the Tristan which not only looked good, but tasted good as well. And finally another had the Jasper as well with pepperoni and banana peppers/Pepperoncis added to it. Everyone enjoyed their food and had a nice time.   All in all a nice addition to the area surrounding it! So many great places to choose from all in one spot! Parking is gawdawful during lunch time, but I won't dock a star for that, now if only they delivered. Maybe they could team up with the Jimmy Johns across the parking lot for delivery...mmmm!  The staff was friendly, funny, and got along well with each other. I will definitely give this pizza another whirl! You could sit inside or outside and the outside had some nicely shaded tables. Another plus was that they served your pizza to you on an actual plate!

First time here and it will definitely not be my last time. My friend and I came here to watch the Saints and Niners game. Its seat yourself,  but we wanted to ait at the bar. The bar is very with an excellent selection of drinks and beers on tap. The atmosphere is light and relaxing. It had a nice and mixed crowd.  The staff were friendly and attentive. They also would engage a friendly and spirited discussion about the pros and cons of the teams playing.  I had their seasonal which was a 4 Peaks Pumpkin porter. My friend had the Kilt Lifter. The glasses came in nice and frozen mugs every time.  The bartender Chelsea was very friendly,  fun,  and johnny on the spot with refills. She did a spectacular job! It was a full bar and most of the table areas were full. She was constantly working and made it fun to ve there.  As did the rest of the staff.  I had the Hot Texas Burger and fries which was fantastic. Very well done and just tasty. I love jalapeños and bacon  a burger. My friend had the bacon cheese burger. Which he said was delicious.   The mens restroom was very clean and nice. Which is always a pleasant surprise whenever I am at a sports bar/restaurant.   Even though it was a heck of a drive it wad well worth the trip. Drinks and were a bit more then I normally pay for,  but the quality of the drinks, food, and staff were second to none. Also there is free wifi as well.
