I went in to do some enlarging at 3AM as the FedEx Office is 24 hrs. There were 3 individuals sleeping at the computers and 1 sleeping next to the register. 1 had an IV drug needle on the desk by the computers. I spoke with the FedEx employee who indicated she knew the person and he was diabetic. Now I am sympathetic to both the homeless and handicap but 1) I dont care if he is diabetic and 2) I dont need to see a needle, used or otherwise, on the desk AND 3) the needle was put in a regular garbage can, not a biohazard can like at a hospital. This not only puts workers at risk but is pretty scummy too. The employee seemed to know that these people were sleeping in her store but didnt seem to care when I mentioned it.   Basically if this is what FedEx Office wants to be known as, a homeless shelter, than fine. But I never associated FedEx with this kind of situation and I am very hesitant to go back or recommend this location to anyone. I could handle the sleeping but the IV needle on the desk was too much.

Got a call from the General Manager John who was very nice and assured me they are not a homeless shelter. Perhaps I will go back and try them again.

What people need to remember about Denny's or Jenny's is that even though the social atmosphere is outrageous and you WILL meet awesome people, it is still DENNY's. Therefore expecting it to be an outrageous food experience is a nice wish but ultimately they have he same ingredients, same crappy thin bacon, same decent fries etc etc as every other Denny's. If you want a late night hangout this is awesome. If you want culinary uniqueness it's not happening.

I love this place and go there like a regular. It is not a typical sushi bar. My gf hates sushi and one side of their menu is dedicated to the "non sushi" person. It is a very stylish upscale but not pricey place. All the waitresses are super cool and quite sexy too. I see lots of families there and the regulars really are regular..whether at the bar or table they have a great selection of imported beer. maybe I think of it as a neighborhood sushi place.

I got a gift certificate as a birthday present (and it was cool they offer gift certificates) for a haircut and a shave. Josh was very pleasant and skilled. Though I arrived a little late they didnt give away my appointment. Overall it was a fun experience. They also have a man to get your shoes shined which is very convenient. Unfortunately one cannot get the shoes shined while they get a haircut.  My haircut wasnt even really a proper haircut as I am totally bald, so it was more of a sheep shear. But Josh did make me feel like he put effort into it.   Downside - So you are on the border of Expensive Phoenix and Overly Expensive Scottsdale. $50 for a haircut and a shave. If you want to spend that then this is a great place for you to go. It is very nice inside and the guys are pro's. I usually spend $30 for the same service at 12th St & Northern (12th St. Barbers)  near my house. It is purely a geography thing.  Worse - Parking is a nightmare. They share this extremely small parking lot with a very popular tavern. Parking is across the street at Safeway if it is crowded.

If you use a debit card for your payment they run a hard credit check. That includes points on your credit report as an inquiry. Bring a credit card and you won't have this problem.  There is no possible way I can recommend this place. They are really terrible.

I will go here to get pierced by Jeremiah because I think he is one of the very best piercers in Arizona.  The piercing prices really aren't any higher than most places, nor are the prices for standard jewelry. It's when people get fancier stuff that they see the price difference. They do not use ANY Korean or Chinese sweat-shop jewelry. Most, if not all, of their steel is American made, internally threaded, implant grade, and well finished (the finish is what protects the wearer against the metals that would cause a reaction). You can get a tongue piercing from Jeremiah for $53, or you can go somewhere else and get it for $50 with crappy sweat-shop, externally threaded jewelry of unknown material.  However as I am extremely picky about who is sticking a needle in me, I will go to Halo for my favorite piercer.

I use Yelp to not only vent about bad places but also find new places to experience. After living down the street (northern/19th ave) from this place for 2 years I thought Ill give it a shot..like so many other Yelpers on here..it seems this is the kind of place that sorta gets lost..until you pass it enough times to notice it and then you just want to try it.  I went in and it's literally your neighborhood bar with food. That's not always a bad thing because some bars have awesome if slightly unhealthy food. 3 TV's all doing football, many many beers on tap and overall a nice ambiance feel. DEFINITELY a neighborhood sports bar.  I waited about 5 minutes for the only waitress to give me a menu and when I explained it was my first time she grunted and walked off. So I went to the bar and just ordered. Do you know when you go to someplace the first time and you think you want to eat there but that vibe just says "go home and eat it"..well that's what I got..It wasnt a bad place and I already ordered the food..but it wasn't friendly either. I am sure the regulars have a grand old time but I just wanted all that impressed with the service or hospitality. Maybe Ill go back for karaoke if the food is good.  My major major pet peeve: .50 for take out on the bill. I know they want me to consume as much beer as possible..they already charged me $2 for a pepsi. But a take out fee...on a sunday afternoon...with the bar empty after the football game is over...ridiculous. I skimped on the tip because of it and she let me know how unwelcome I really was at that point.  gonna go eat the food now..had to write this first.  2/3lb cheesburger, 1 mozz beer sticks, 1 pepsi plus $1 tip, $.50 takeout was 18 bucks.  AFTER EATING: I had the cheese sticks and they were really really good..I think they are called beer cheese pints..Excellent 100%  The burger was a good burger..it wasnt the best ever, it wasnt the worst ever..It was good. It was totally greasy as you would expect but it did stay on the bun the whole time. The cheese was interesting..it didnt feel like fake cheese but tasted kinda like it..so I dont know.  I might go back but overall first impressions were just 2 stars, I say this. if you want a neighborhood bar with solid good and excellent beers this is your place. If you want a family outing stick to McDonalds

The good, the bad and the ugly from a guy that goes to this location every night for a year.  The good: They are always stocked and I mean stocked to the rafters. Every time I go in their one of the floor managers is always putting something new in or someone is putting new stuff in. This place never ever runs out of goods, food or liquor. It is one of the best places for alcohol in the area with an extensive selection including some unique beers. Their pharmacy is 100% the very best I have ever been to. I went in post-root canal and the pharmacist who only knew me by sight saw I was in pain and excused previous customers to get me the prescription. I felt he went above and beyond at that point.  Most of the checkout people are really helpful..Luis, Phillip, Terra, Matt are always there with a smile. These are nice friendly people that want you to find what you are looking for.  The bad: Their bakery section is extremely bad..a very limited selection of bread, cakes and other baked items one would expect to find. Perhaps this is not their forte` for the area as several bakeries are located within a short drive and there is a very large Fry's about a mile away too. But it is a little disappointing. They also removed all the self-checkout machines which can cause the lines to get a wee long. Granted they work pretty hard to get the lines moving but I preferred the easy use self checkout for simple purchases. One small thing..this place looks like it was built and stayed in the 70's..a makeover would do this place wonders.  The ugly: do not under any circumstances be lured in by 8 pieces fried chicken for $4.99. They advertise it for Fridays, it is appealing, the smell is right on but do yourself a favor and go up the road to KFC, spend the extra $2-3 and save yourself the return trip for pepto..This is my most profound advise on this place.  Additionally their policy on returns is: No receipt than you get a little Albertsons gift card to make new purchases. It is not a bad policy and I am sure helps most people get their return and purchase new things right away.

With mobile groomers being in such high demand I didnt know how long I would have to wait. I called on Friday and got an appt for the following Wed. Compared to some other smaller groomer companies that was not terrible considering they are closed Sunday/Monday. There are 3 huge +'s for this company  1. They are located in North Central Phoenix 2. They have more than 1 van to roam and groom 3. Their first appt is at 7am  They were very prompt. I have a large cat (27lb) and I was quoted $50-60 depending on hair length not size of cat. The bill was $67 which seemed like an odd amount but I still have a $8 to round it out. I figured it was the size and time which was approx 45 min. I am sure a smaller cat would be less expensive.   They do ask that you have a way to plug in their 100ft extension cord to get power to their truck. If you live in an apt this service may not work for you unless there is a garage or something.  My cat looks good and I didnt have to take him down to petco and risk him pooping the carry case on the way there. So is $75 worth the non poop..yes it is..yes it is....

Perhaps because this is close to ASU they think no one will notice the quality of sushi. Because students run in and out or do take out perhaps no one bothers to say anything. But the reality is for people that enjoy good fish, soft rice and dont mind spending the extra few $$ for quality this is not the place for you. I always think of this place as "fast food sushi"..It comes out fast but I ALWAYS feel something is either missing or wrong. If I am in the area and with friends and they want a low cost sushi experience I will go but then I do simple rolls that are harder to screw up. Not the worst, not the best..but maybe just right for the students that visit the most.  ps. I dont live close so I dont go for happy hour. This review is based on non happy hour service. From reviews it is clear they put a lot of effort into alcohol and happy hour. Perhaps after 2-3 drinks the fish tastes better or the price makes it worth while to come back.

I am completely puzzled by the 4-5 star experiences at this place. The staff is super friendly but somewhat oblivious to their competition of other hookah bars in Tempe or perhaps they simply dont care. My experience left a bitter metallic taste and it was not just from the quick starter coals they use.   Unlike other hookah bars in/around Tempe, Red Sea charges a cover for anyone entering the lounge. It is $3 for anyone to sit even if they purchase a hookah, so this is an added fee much like a bar. I had a meeting of 10 people and we took the back corner. As people trickled in they were asked to show ID and pay $3. The reason is that "if it gets too busy we need to charge people to sit" which would have done well on a Friday/Saturday but this was a Tuesday and the place had 4 other patrons. Be prepared to pay a cover whether you are sitting or smoking.  We did have 2 hookahs with 2 hoses ($28) plus the covers ($30)..It was a very greedy experience.  Red Sea does have an open area with couches, lounges and pillows to sit on. Unfortunately their ventilation is absolutely abhorrent which means I get to smell what the other guys are smoking in the other sections. It was mildly humorous when Purple Haze started playing and there really was one inside.   They charge per hose so a 1 hose is $12, 2 hose is $14, 3 for $16 and 4 for $18...plus the cover..BUT they do not increase the size of their bowls NOR do they give you extra bowls. So, as most hookah smokers know, the more people that smoke the faster the bowl goes. If they offered a deeper bowl for the 3/4 hoses that would make sense.  I can get over the cover, the high cost for hookah and the crappy ventilation. What I cannot abide by is the quick starter coals. Seriously get a hot plate, get some coals, make people wait a few minutes, do it properly! The stuff tastes metallic and it is just gross. Anyone that uses coconut coals will detest this taste as the entire hookah loses that sweet taste just a few minutes in.   What does this place have that no other hookah bars have..LOCATION. It is within walking distance from most ASU campus housing units and fraternities. Therefore they can offer the crappy stuff and know they will still make money from it.   I am not being an ass, just dont go here if you are a hookah aficionado.

Pros: They make everything super fresh They are attentive and super nice Everything was fresh and tasty The menus are cute with info from different times they have been open on the back  Cons I signed up for the email newsletter and did not get my promised bear claw. boo  As we are visitors to Las Vegas it was a nice diner type experience. Not too expensive and very filling. Why not 5 stars? I really wanted that bear claw. Waitress said next time. Not cool.

FEZ is a chic` restaurant where all the cool kids go. Whether you are there for lunch, dinner or drinks it has an easy atmosphere with mid range pricing. I consider this to be a very eclectic menu so if you are sick of the same-old food, try out FEZ

Classic Irish Pub with particularly classic Irish pub food. Some of their menu is also inaccurate so ask before ordering.   Pros: Good service (Bridget was very attentive), nice beer selection as one would expect from a pub like this, music was not too loud, food was filling  Cons: The food may be filling but it was also bland  There is nothing particularly bad or good about this place. I am sure if I was a heavy drinker this would be a great place to have a pint. I went there for dinner and it was mediocre. $27 for 2 people including a Strongbow Cider so not terrible price either.  It's the place you pass on Camelback Ave all the time wondering if you should go in there and have a drink, but you never do and keep driving.

Tuesday Night. Walked in at 830pm, left 945pm. From order to being served 15 min.  This place is NOT a chain. Support your local Phoenix BBQ restaurants.  One of the few places in Arizona that serves Beef Ribs. Cannot over-emphasize this point..better than Claim Jumper..not even close. Beef ribs have twice as much meat as pork ribs but are much harder to find in restaurants.   They smoke all their meat on site and everything is super fresh. Melissa & Sawyer were fabulous and I really appreciated the 10% off for using YELP.   The only downside is that because we sat close to the chicken rack in the back near the kitchen we wound up smelling like a campfire. However we didnt really notice this until after we left and went back to the outside.   The cornbread starter and donut pastry ender was absolutely unexpected and refreshing.   Beef Ribs = $22.00 12. Oz Sirloin = $12.00 2 Non Alcoholic Drinks Total was $45.00 with 10% off..Extremely reasonable, high quality, totally full.

Only because zero is not available. Worst hospital in Phoenix!  In most hospitals people go to the ER because it is a genuine emergency. Because this is a teaching hospital many go to the ER for primary care. My wife went in at 830am Thursday complaining of kidney/back issues. We waited about 45 min as others came and went through triage before us even though they came in after us.  After asking the triage nurse what is going on they tell me that anyone that comes in complaining of chest issues automatically goes to the front of the triage line. Now it is fairly obvious that some of these chest issue patients are not having a heart attack. They are laughing and smiling and otherwise having a regular morning reading the paper. My wife is now in tears but we cannot get bumped to the front because it is kidney not chest.  We left and went to John C Lincoln on 2nd St & Dunlap. They saw her, got her into the ER in 35 min and it was quick.  If you value your life do not go to Phoenix Baptist. You might die waiting.

I am a huge fan. I get my hair cut here every 3-4 weeks. I get the full shave treatment plus a haircut. It is nice, clean, TV's are always on stations I like, not alot of kids go in there to socialize and in general a really nice barbershop. I love getting the actual straight razor treatment. Not expensive at all and the longest I have ever waited was 15 minutes. They guys are friendly to chat with and no pressure. This is the only barber I go to and I live about 5 miles away. It is worth the drive to stay at the place I enjoy.

How many 5 star ratings do I have...this is absolutely one and no I dont work there.  Ta's is a locally owned, operated auto repair shop that really puts the time, effort and information into fixing your car. We have been going their for years and I am shocked no one wrote a review yet. I could detail many auto nightmare's but I will be simply in this review.   1. Ta's does not f*ck you..you know what I mean when auto repair places f*ck you..you walk away going..."man I feel f*cked!" because it should not cost $xxx to fix a muffler or a air conditioner etc. Ta's does not do that to you..$20 oil change is about as good a price as you will find. He fixed my air conditioner console for $50...it is now perfect. This is a great place  2. Ta's is a small 2-3 person auto repair shop with 2-3 bays. So yes you may need to wait a day and if you can't than this may not be for you. But if you want the repair to be done well than go out and rent a car for a day and give him time to fix it. I would rather go to a place that will fix it the first time than a huge auto shop that has idiots that barely know how to use a wrench. (not making generalizations but this seems to be a common element)  3. If you are a regular he will interrupt current work to fit you in. I ran over a pot hole and my inner right wheel well slipped out. I ran over to Ta's and explained that I was going to work and this happened and I was screwed. He lowered an engine rebuild for me to fix a wheel well..show me another place that does that. It was a miracle and I am grateful. He said it would cost $20, I gave him $30 and he actually gave me $10 back...he is very honest (I still gave him the tip)  This is a real guy that makes real connections. He remembers your name and your car and knows what he did last time so not to "review and decide". I go for my scheduled once a year maintenance on time, usually on a Saturday, and he is extremely professional and direct. Ta's is the very best auto repair shop in Phoenix ...

I am a huge fan of Cafe Istanbul and I will say it immediately so you know this may be a bias account. I buy all of my coals, shisha and most of my hookahs from here. Their extremely wide selection of Shisha brands - Starbuzz, Havana, Al Fakir, Layalina and more is the widest selection in Phoenix.  No I dont work for them. I just like this place alot.  Pros: Upstairs isolated comfy air-conditioned with couches Hookah smoking area..you can take the food from downstairs and bring it upstairs and smoke and eat. Totally legal and legit.   The amazing selection of shisha, hookahs and hookah products is one thing BUT the menu is really special. I absolutely adore shwarma (lamb) and it is really hard to find it skewered right off with pickles, tomatoes..its all kinds of yummy goodness.  The lamb is great..they also have a lunch and dinner selection..so like lamb in pita for lunch but a lamb plate with rice and extras for dinner. same lamb just more of it.   So food is awesome, hookah is awesome..so why only 4 stars when Im a groupie?  Con: Sometimes due to ASU student changes their service can be a bit temperamental. new staff dont know how to do things and in the winter or summer it can be annoying especially being a regular. When my favorite waiter leaves to go home to Indiana and the new person takes over...well I dont feel all that special right then.  But thankfully the more I go then they know me and its all good.  Also even though the menu is really fantabulous..it is not the best pita place in the entire world..it has other focuses besides pita..hence pita jungle across the street is probably better at pita's but they dont have hookahs..this place mixes original food with a fun hookah experience.

Wednesday, 730 pm, no reservation, seating took 5 minutes. I highly recommend a reservation for Fri/Sat as I could see how this place gets packed fast. I was told reservations are simple and held if there are delays so why not do it anyway.  An extremely pleasant birthday evening at a new place we had never tried. Aiello's is a side facing Italian restaurant on Central just north of Camelback..Easy to pass since the parking lot is in the back.   Do not go in the back as that is for pick up pizza's only which they run out of quickly. The Owner told us you can reserve a pizza early and then call to have it made for pick up at any time but they only make so many dough balls an evening so if you wait they may run out. So reserve your pizza as it is worth it. They do not serve pizza in the dining room.  Upon entrance you will find a very cozy warm environment with a full bar and about 15-20 tables. The 4 of us happen to be seated almost dead center which was slightly loud but not too bad. The wine list is extensive though surprisingly they did not have a Riesling by the glass..not huge a negative. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the wine list which you would tend to find at that size of Italian restaurant.  We ordered Calamari & a Caesar Salad for appetizers which came out within 10 minutes. Fresh bread was quickly served as was the Pinot Grigio my friend had. Service was quality at that point.   For some reason the waitress delayed taking our main course until we were nearly done with the appetizer. I rarely second guess the wait staff as I do not know how many are serving tables etc but this delay made my gf remark to me and it was something we did discuss on the ride home. When it becomes a point of reference I usually mark it in a review.  Main course was served promptly and I must say the food was heaven. My Veal Parmigiana was exquisite and certainly much better than Carabbas or a similar place. My guests loved the Tortilini which had a wonderful buttery/smooth velvet taste. Combined with the bread it was a succulent experience. Definitely something to look forward to again or maybe try something slightly different. The pomadoro  sauce was also outstanding on my side spaghetti which I wound up taking home.  I really appreciate the Owner/Chef checking on us 3 different times..asking how the food was and if we needed anything else. A superior host is always the sign of an attentive local unique eatery. As a fellow New Yorker I loved that he came from Brooklyn which just made the experience that much more authentic. As the guests wore down the sound expectantly dissipated which made for easy dessert conversation. I was rewarded with a Tirimisu cake for my birthday. While I usually do not like coffee based cake this was very delicious and splitting it with my table was a nice touch.  So 4 stars for the first time out..would have been 5 but for these small but salvageable itelms  1. Service could have been a little better but still 4 people 1.5 hours was not bad at all 2. The Calamari was mostly the extra fried part..I would say maybe 60% we ate, the rest went back on the plate. 3. A nice wine list is great; I consider a Riesling to be a staple of many menu's and it would have been nice to have a glass with dinner.   Call me picky but that is why I write these kind of reviews. When I go back if this changes I will be sure to edit it appropriately as I do for all my reviews.

I live about 30 minutes away without traffic and I love going to this place even though other places are closer. Im just going to bullet point it out  1. $20, all you can eat, good solid sushi and fish, comes with miso, edema-me, sashimi appetizer included and choice of ice cream desert  EDIT: Just found out if you go in solo you do not get the sashimi appetizer. It is only for 2 or more all you can eat guests  2. weekday half price menu from 10am-10pm..comes with miso and edema-me ..example: philly roll which they make with carrots is $3.50 for this time  3. excellent spacious room with sushi bar  4. not just fish..a nice range of non fish products  5. hot towels thrown at you from behind sushi bar  6. 2 people, weekday night, 8 veggie and fish rolls, $30!  In short this is NOT Zen32..it is not Moto, it isnt even SushiQ..BUT it is a very good place with an excellent menu and a fabulous staff. So if you want to try something new and dont have a lot to spend, this is the place.

Monday night 8pm, the place is semi dead. I presume this is a real hit during the daytime with the close proximity to Luke AirForce Base. I do give good sushi reviews for other places and the one saving grace of this place is the nice decor. It also has a Teppan section though I did not see any chef's at the time.   The sushi was average but extremely over priced. Salmon Roll $6 Rainbow Roll $11 California Roll $5.50 1 Salmon Nigiri $8  The portions are not bigger or smaller than any other sushi restaurant, it is just over priced due to the location in the "rich" part of Avondale. So if you want mediocre sushi that is overpriced this is the place for you.  Darnell was our waiter and he was very good.

A good diner atmosphere with large portions and a friendly staff will always get at least 4 stars. There was nothing particular about this place that made it stand out supremely to give it 5. A solid place I would go back to with a wide selection.

Epic fail  Came over to evaluate fixing my swing which he indicated would be an easy fix but he couldn't do it that day (Saturday). He asked if he could come over on Monday which I agreed. He asked if I could leave the back gate to the yard open even though I would be at work which I agreed to. When I came home from work Monday the swing was not fixed, I did not receive any phone call and when I texted/called I got no response despite several voice mails.   Therefore I do not recommend.

Upon first glance this is appears to be a very usual strip mall type bar but behind the black glass lies a more unusual bar and grill.  We went on a Sunday for the Jets-Ravens game and it was a fun time.. This is one of those places you likely have passed a hundred times on the way to work or going to Scottsdale using Indian School Rd. It is set back into the strip mall so you would not see it from the street. Why Teakwoods is special comes from its extremely quality food which you would not expect from a place that lets you throw peanut shells on the floor. Like most bars it has a bevy of TV's and a rowdy but pleasant crowd.   The food was really good though I would never call this "fine dining". An extremely great place to go when you want to be stuffed with semi-greasy food..I had their famous wings and I can honestly say they were outrageous. I especially liked the cheese balls which are hard to find as WineBurger stopped carrying them.  No particular reason this place wasn't 5 stars..it just didnt have that 5 star feel..maybe in the future when I go back.

I went out to see my favorite performer Alice who I love because she has lots of tattoos and piercings and not many strip clubs allow girls like that. I think it's super sexy but some guys prefer different things..giant boobs, firm ass, small rack..whatever..we each have our unique interests.  I went on a Friday night so this review is limited to 930pm to midnight.  Pros: Extremely clean, excellent sound (could still have a conversation but not screaming), 3:1 girl/guy ratio, solid drinks, all focus on 1 stage with 2 very high poles, $5 cover so not bad at all.  Cons: The DJ would not shut up. Every 5-10 seconds it was something he wanted to say. I go there to get a dance, look at hot women, drink a few and in general have a good time. The guy's voice got old fast. Nothing wrong with some encouragement or announcement between sets or songs but interrupting the girl's pole trick to get the drink special out isnt what Im there for.  So-So: Drinks were typically over priced but that's what you get for going to a really really new club. It isn't on the "path"..2 miles WEST of the Hockey/Football stadium on Glendale..so not just next door. But the location is quite good..parking was ample.   Bouncers were not douchebags and I like that too. Overall a very fun night and didnt cost me more than $45 for 4 drinks, cover and 1 dance.

I went here the day it opened and thought it might be just another Italian place..and now every time I go I check in on FourSquare! It's totally addictive..the restaurant...I love their inexpensive Monday-Tuesday Spaghetti & Meatballs. Their onion bread with basil is really great..they even have a little bar. I go here once a week; the staff is super nice. Say hi to Tim the Manager cause He is always a charmer!

I will preface this review to say it was Christmas day and Carl's Jr was the only thing open. I had no other options and I had never been to this particular fast food chain.  The location is quite clean. That is why it got 2 stars.  The food is atrocious; the people are ambivalent and the fries are greasy. I will save you all from my usual banter and witty remarks.   Dont go here unless you invest in pepto bismal!

I have hired Scandalesque at every major event I have ever produced and they are absolutely the very best burlesque in Phoenix. It's not just what they do but the professionalism in which they do it. I have attended their open houses and from amateur to advanced they teach, train and treat every person as a star. Whether you want to learn how to be a fabulous full time burlesque dancer or as a hobby Scandalesque brings huge experience. My crowds always love watching Scandalesque and I always get requests to book them for bigger shows. They are as good as it gets.

Highly convenient if you are in the Portales Business Center in Scottsdale. FREE delivery to any office for any amount of food in the 2 building complex rain or shine, early or late. I ordered a cheese danish for $1.50 and got it delivered. That kind of service is rare and worth this review.  The food menu is very reasonable. My lunch with combo is never over $10/day. I cannot speak for the coffee side since I dont drink coffee. But the overall atmosphere, the quickness of the ordering and giving and the general inexpensive without eating crap is really great.   If you are coming through Scottsdale during the day and looking for a gem with good food and solid prices this is a nice change.

Deal is exclusively for shower or bathroom sink. $140 for kitchen sink. Nice hook with the $59 graphic but at least he is honest when I called. Pleasant guy to speak with. Disclaimer or not, the graphic is the hook..  Despite not using his service, he wrote a very nice personal message through the Yelp business section. I give him 4 stars for his personal attention to detail. his prices were a little bit more than I can handle at the moment but my earlier bad review was price only.

Bootlegger (Turkey/Roast Beef, extra beef plus bacon). I had never had this particular sandwich place before. They may be huge in the midwest but there are only  a few of them in Phoenix.   Much better than Subway or Quizno's. The bread is fabulous and the price is very similar. It was excellent and I will drive the 5-6miles to go get it. Nothing negative about the food. Hope they put one in mid-west phoenix :)

It is simply the best pizza you will find in Las Vegas and perhaps west of the Mississippi. If you come from the tri-state area , and I'm not talking about Arizona Utah Mexico, you must stop off at this amazing home away from home pizza place. NO RANCH!

I rented this venue for an upcoming event and really love the renovation. It has a huge inside and fantastic lighting. There is added VIP seating on each side of the venue which lets you get a high vantage view of the entire dance floor and stage. Their special VIP back area is swank. The venue has embraced our rental and event so from a management/promoter perspective they are great! it really is a super great venue. everyone should check it out.

6 people seated at 515pm on Monday. Fantastic service and even as it became packed by 7pm our server was on point. Steak, pesto pasta, pizza and salads super fresh and tasty. The open kitchen was warm and inviting with people scurrying around but not loud or annoying. Worth the experience.

When you're on a larger contract and unavailable to do the jobs that your Yelp profile is for, make some kind of profile notation so people know not to waste their time calling you. you might be an extremely amazing plumber but I will never find out.

My first and great experience to this unique sushi restaurant. Mixing Hispanic / Latino culture with sushi is definitely different. They offer a wide variety of traditional Hispanic dishes and secondary sushi rolls. On the back of their very colorful menu they blend sushi and Hispanic food into Latino rolls. If you are looking to try something different and don't want the same Hispanic or sushi restaurant this would be a good place for you. It was a clean comfortable setting and easy to find with good parking.  The rainbow roll I had was large, filling and fresh. $12.00 worth it

I'm going to preface this entire review by saying it was Mother's Day and we were a large party.   Especially because it was Mother's Day, and there were reservations, the restaurant was extremely poorly staffed. They even admitted they were understaffed which makes absolutely no sense because if you have the reservations you know how many waiters & serviced staff you need.   But even if we had good service the food is mediocre. The bacon is OK, the eggs are eggs, the chicken parm was rubber chicken with the red sauce and cheese. There was nothing overly special about this food. It was not home cooked or had a flair of special ingredients or really any passion at all. Again it was very busy and I understand that the kitchen was probably overwhelmed not just by us but by the entire day. So maybe some food got heat lamps for a while and they want to bring out the entire table at once. But when you have 16 people at the table bringing all the food out at once doesn't work. And when some of that is just cold and gross and we have to send food back anyway then bringing it out all at once is moot.  It is entirely possible that you might go to this neighborhood Italian restaurant and enjoy yourself. If you have medium standards for what Italian food should be , then you probably will like the food. They have breakfast lunch and dinner, and it resembles more of an Italian 'Diner',  pulling that term from the East Coast. Most serious Italian restaurants do not offer french toast for breakfast on their menu. So you might see this as a one-stop-shop for many different varieties of food during the day. But the reality is it is not a coveted Italian restaurant.

Monday 12:30 Noon Lunch Easy seating Friendly Hostess & Waitress Lovely inside Casual, sunny day, sat inside.   A well stocked menu showing East/West coast and Gulf seafood treats. The food selection was not the problem. I could have ordered numerous items as they all looked good. Ordered Buffalo Popcorn Shrimp appetizer & standard 'Fish & Chips' + Iced Tea  Buffalo Popcorn Shrimp smelled spicy, tasted spicy but was otherwise very bland. As if I had already eaten a few already and now my taste buds just acknowledged that one typical wing taste. I didnt taste the shrimp at all, it was just chewy.  'Fish & Chips' - Greasy, bland & boring. I've been called a 'plain eater' before because I like simply food. This was on the other side of me simple because it lacked any real taste effort at all. Cod that was battered and fried and then placed on my plate greasy is not enticing.   Total price with tip $35. Not worth it.  Though this place may get an edited review in the future I am disinterested in going back at this moment.
