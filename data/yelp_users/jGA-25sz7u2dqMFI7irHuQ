We went to this restaurant last night and noticed that the prices have gone way up, so I had settled for expensive plate of simple chicken when my husband and I noticed that a small roach-like bug was crawling up the wall behind us. We were seated just on the other side of the kitchen, right below the window to look inside of it. We told our server who got the manager. He said "oh it's just a stink bug" and grabbed it with a tissue and threw it away. We asked for a new table and he went to find a new one. While he was gone (about 3 minutes) another critter started crawling up the wall and went right under the wood by the window into the kitchen area. At that point we just left. It was really disgusting. We have always loved their food, but I think it's going to be a very long time before we can go back there and we will not recommend this place to anybody again.

Beware of any company that requires you to mail in a letter to cancel your services. We all know that means they will just keep drafting your bank account to their desire. Just like LA Fitness did. So I now have to prepare to contact the bank and have them refuse payment to Monitronics to stop this nonsense

Their food is okay, but they continuously change their menu and business name. It's very very irritating and confusing. I am done ordering from this place.

The queso dip is good. Our service wasn't good, the peel and eat shrimp tasted old and spoiled. Salad never came. Fajitas were drowning in grease.

We have used this company twice now and their work is great!  We had an $8k quote from one company to fix our ac, and this company fixed the problem for less than 2k and not a problem since!  Yesterday we called for a family in need of help and they came within hours and fixed the problem for a reasonable price. I definitely recommend this company

We needed a new tree line installed in our back yard. After figuring out the complicated mess the previous homeowners left us, Tom arranged to have a new tree line installed. It works great, and he worked out payments with us. I will recommend this company any time
