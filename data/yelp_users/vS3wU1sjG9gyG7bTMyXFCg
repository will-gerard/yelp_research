I give them two stars because they did clean the inside okay-ish. But the outside had tons of water spots and wasn't done very well. They were super busy so I suppose the water dried before they had a chance to dry it, but I was surprised at how bad my car looked. Won't be going back here!

Love this place. Great pizza, good wings, good service....a great spot for NY Pizza. Also they have a great selection of slices at lunch time. I recommend this spot for sure!

They do it right here. I never order what is on the menu, because I am somewhat picky and like my own thing. Every time I come here, I order what I want and they nail it. Last time I ordered a Caesar salad with salmon on top and a side of steamed broccoli. The salmon was some of the best I've ever had! Another favorite of mine here are the mashed potatoes (pomme pur√©e) as they call it. The staff is superb, they go above and beyond for you and make your experience a pleasurable one. It's not a cheap meal but a good meal for sure.

First time here was today. I typically get protein smoothies from Whole Foods, but didn't feel like driving the extra few miles, so I figured I'd give this place a shot.  All I can say is yuck! The smoothie tasted horrible - a very distinctive chemical taste and watery. I won't be back.

I am giving them 4 stars for one reason - the french fries.  We go here about 1-2 times per week and each time we get the same thing.  I get the french dip sandwich, my friend gets the burger and my other friend gets the rotisserie chicken.  All of the entrees are delicious and well done.  The only issue I have is that the French fries are always luke warm when you get them.  We have been seated by the kitchen before and you can see that they make a bunch of fries and then put them under heat lamps to try to keep them warm - and each time we send the fries back for fresh hot ones.  Everything else about this place is fantastic - the food, the service, ambiance.  I like it and will keep coming back...and re-ordering fries until they come out hot!

I came tonight as I do often, there was 5 of us. We got here at 5:30 (eating with the old folks crowd) and the hostess said it would be a 30 minute wait. We waited until 6:10 and asked about our table....she now says 25minutes. When I asked why it would be another 25, she rudely told us that she quoted 45 mins at first. Liar! I like this place but with bad staff from the get-go I don't know if I'll come back. Here I come White Chocolate Grill - food is as good or better and the staff is great!

These people are crooks.  They promise you the world - deliver nothing.  Their price was cheap, but the hidden fees and the lack of follow through is unbelievable.  Steer clear of these folks!  (I initially posted this review under their Oregon location inadvertantly.)  I have only dealt with the Phoenix location.

Yuck!  I came here with a friend who had heard that it was a good spot for fish and chips.  I can tell you that my experience here was less than savory.  The decor of the restaurant is run down and the staff is substandard.  The menu is filled with lots of different items, all of which are very inexpensive.  I ordered the fish and chips and the fish lacked flavor except for the horrible taste of old fryer oil that really was in need of a change.  Even the soda didn't taste right.  The hot sauce bottles on the table looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in years and were disgusting.  Lastly, they have signs posted that the restrooms are out of order, but they really aren't. The lady behind the counter told me that they posted that to keep the homeless people out.  I won't be back to this place - it is amazing to me that they are still in business. Yuck!

Dining at this restaurant was quite an experience!  Being my first visit to a Dim Sum restaurant, I was a little bit confused about how it worked...and I still am!  The place was very busy and I was seated promptly.  I was given a menu to look at and then these carts started coming around with different types of dishes on them.  Many of the staff manning the carts didn't speak great English, so I wasn't sure what some of the items were.  I tried several different dishes, each had good flavor and I enjoyed them.  Overall this was a good experience, but certainly not the usual Chinese food dining atmosphere.  One thing to note is that the sweet rolls are out of this world.

This is a Mom n Pop restaurant in Phoenix that has fresh food, good service and a "home" kind of feel.  It is owned by a Greek husband and wife that has been there every time I've been in.  They have gyro specials that include fries and a drink.  I prefer the chicken gyro, they do it very well.  Prices are great for the meal that you get.  The homemade hummus is really great!  We come here often because the food is good, price is right, owners are very nice and I like to support local businesses.  My only complaints are that sometimes they run out of hummus and the baklava isn't the best.  Other than that, a really great spot. Highly recommend.

Elements is hard to beat.  The views of Camelback Mountain are fantastic.  This place is perfect for a romantic dinner at sunset.  I've had several meals here from breakfast to dinner and everything that I have tasted here has been done right.  The bacon wrapped filet is perfect.  The mashed potatoes are out of this world.  The Elemental breakfast is a lot of food but all of it is done so well.  The bakery basket is also very good, but varies from day to day.  The service is exceptional here - they really go out of their way to make sure your dining experience is top notch.  It is a bit pricey, but well worth it.  This is my go to for date night.

This place is a total hipster joint.  Mismatched furniture, trendy people, a very "artsy" crowd.  It makes for an interesting place to enjoy a good cup of coffee and there is always good people watching.  I have eaten here many times, typically go for coffee and breakfast.  The music is a bit loud - but not too bad.  Things you must try for breakfast are the breakfast sandwich and THE BACON is TO DIE FOR!!!  This place is for sure in the running for the best bacon in Phoenix!  The lunch menu changes everyday, I have never been for dinner. I definitely recommend this place if you are looking for something trendy and different than your usual coffee shop.

The food is great, totally different than anything you'll get anywhere else. They also will let you taste things when you order if it is your first time. The cookies on the weekend are the best!

Was in the area visiting a friend and came across this little diner (that I guess was featured in a show before my time).  The selection of food is just what you expect from a diner, quality is good and everything I had was done well.  The waitress was friendly and they move pretty quickly. I'll be back if in the area

This Starbucks staff is awful. They are poor with customer service, they are sloppy and hand me dripping drinks every single day in the drive thru. They get my drink wrong often. They aren't very nice except for a few of them. I wouldn't stop here ever if there was another Starbucks on my way to work

Love this spot for the solid breakfast fare, good coffee, perfect atmosphere for a business meeting or a place to stop at after the gym.  They have a bunch of stuff to buy, novelty items and such.  I'm glad this place is around.

We ordered takeout from here for our office today.  When I walked in, the ambiance was good, staff was nice, had the food ready when they said so I didn't have to wait long.  The pizza was excellent - the crust is really good as well as the sauce, cheese, toppings.  Good quality food except the chocolate cake dessert lacked taste.  Seemed like it came out of a box.  Aside from the cake, everything else was great...I recommend this place and will definitely be back to eat there!

We have been here about 5 times and it is a good spot if you want fried chicken and waffles. I ordered the chicken sandwich once - wasn't the best.  The Kool-aid is really good, but it should be served with an insulin pump because it is super sweet! Overall, a great place but the wait is sometimes long on Friday nights especially.

Since Tipton group took over, I highly recommend NOT MOVING HERE!  I continue to live here currently only because I am in a lease.  The fact is, the staff is substandard, they do not maintain the property well, and I get the sense that they do not care.    It's a shame because when Mark Taylor managed this property, the staff was decent and they did keep things clean and maintained.  If you are looking for a place to live, go elsewhere!

This Zipps is horrible. I went here tonight because I was in the area and thought Zipps was a good go to. Boy, was I wrong! The food took forever. They brought out two dishes and then waited another 20 mins to bring the next one. Abigail was our server and she was nice when she came by the table. Aside from that she did next to nothing. Didn't bring enough silverware, she brought enough napkins to kill a small forest. My salad was wilted with a huge core from the head of lettuce in it. The focaccia was cold.  All in all, I won't be back.

Stumbled upon this place on Thanksgiving while trying to find a coffee shop that was open. They're open 24/7 - 365 which is awesome if you ask me! The staff was great and the Americano was well done, the atmosphere is sorta hipster coffee shop but nice and comfortable. They have outdoor seating which is always a plus too. Overall, a great experience and definitely a go to for those late night coffee needs!

This is an awesome little coffee shop right in downtown Phoenix.  Good coffee, comfortable seating, good ambiance and music, service is fine.  All of the things that you look for in a good coffee shop.  I will definitely be back and next time I will be trying the baked goods that looked really good!

What a great neighborhood spot!  Checked this place out for the first time tonight after hearing about it from a friend.  It is a small place with a Mom n Pop feel.  We tried the Bacon Paradise Burger - delicious, fresh, and very reasonably priced.  The jalapeno ranch was tasty.  We also tried the Brulee burger which had a fried egg and burnt sugar on it - was alright, not my favorite.  The french fries are seasoned and done well.  Overall, a great experience and a refreshing type of place for this area.  I'll be back for sure.

This used to be my go to spot for late night eats. That is until the other night when I went in there with a friend and we sat a table. A man came over and told us that we could sit at the bar or we couldn't get service. I told him we didn't want to sit at the bar (I don't drink) and would prefer to eat at a table. He said no way and was rather rude. So we left and went to Zipp's right down the road. It's too bad that the help they have is rather rude and not accommodating...I really like the food, but with bad service, I'll pass.

Good lunch salad for cheap.  I like the place, it is close to my office.  The food is good and the price is reasonable.  Ordering was easy and the take out service was quick.  I'll be back.

I stumbled upon this place in September '14, it was a Monday and I was past due for a haircut.  My former barbershop was closed (like most on Mondays), so I thought I would give this place a shot...I never looked back!    Jacob cut my hair and did the hot towel shave the first time and has done so every week since, I highly recommend this place and especially Jacob - he is skilled and gets the job done well, every time!  The shop is clean and has a good vibe...relaxing music playing, TVs near each station, competitively priced, it's a great spot.  My only complaint is that if you get a shampoo you have to move to a different chair when there is a sink at every station.

I give it two stars because the front desk staff is horrendous and depending on the room you're in, there's a lot of noise from the wine painting place next door. The massage therapists are decent and the prices aren't too bad.  I would go back if it wasn't for the front desk staff...they're the worst!

This is a great burger spot. Cheap, quality, tasty, quick, has a drive through, the stand sauce is out of this world. I give it four stars because the French fries are mediocre. It can get busy and take some time and the staff is young and sometimes not the most efficient. But, the food is great. The short rib tacos are fantastic and they have a drink called horchata that is superb.  It's very casual, borderline fast food--but really yummy. I recommend it for sure.

Under new ownership. It just isn't the same. The new woman at the front counter could use a smile.  Looking for decent Pho in the area?  This place has it.  The Beef Pho is my favorite, it is consistent and has good flavor and fresh ingredients.  The restaurant itself is a bit rundown and old, not much for ambiance.  The price reflects this, but the food is very good.  The waitress (who may also be an owner) is very nice but her English isn't the greatest.  I wouldn't say this is the best Pho I've had, but it is certainly the best in the area.  The fried rice is also very good.

Hats off to the folks at Snooze!  The food, service and atmosphere are spot on.  My favorite dish here is the Caprese Eggs Benedict.  I get that almost everytime I am here.  The orange juice is fresh squeezed and very good.  I am not a huge fan of the coffee here, but that is the only thing.  Our server sent over a Pineapple Cream pancake which sounded gross, but was ABSOLUTELY DELICOUS! The food is consistent and great, the service is very good all the time.  Be careful if you come on a weekend morning, try to get there right when they open or be prepared to wait an hour or more!

The staff at the Asian food bar is outrageous. They could really use a good lesson in customer service. Perhaps the young gentleman who assisted me was new, inexperienced, but he was most certainly rude!  I come here daily for lunch as I work close by, I'll have to consider whether I'll return after today's experience.  Come on Whole Foods, get your hiring practices together and get some good staff!

Checked this place out for the first time a couple weeks ago. The coffee is good, but where they really shine is the breakfast burrito!  It's full of fluffy eggs, bacon, potatoes, and melted cheese wrapped in a tortilla, and then put in the panini press. Bam! It's delicious! The salsa that's served with it is just okay, but the whole thing is awesome! Service is as to be expected, but I'll be coming back often for that addicting breakfast burrito!

The Henry does it right!  I have been several times and I have always had a great experience!  The staff is on top of their game and has provided me with top notch service every time I have been here.  The food is excellent - the pork chop is probably one of the best that I have had.  Prices are reasonable for the quality of food that you're served.  The ambiance in the restaurant is nice.  I highly recommend this spot!

I've been here twice now. I'm giving them two stars for one reason: they lied! The desserts in their glass case are allegedly "home made" but coincidentally, Costco has the exact same desserts that Cherry Tree allegedly "makes from scratch."   The BBQ is pretty good, the Mac and cheese is good and the creamed corn was fantastic. I would give them 4 stars except I am now left to wonder if they make anything in house or if it all comes from Costco....all in all, I won't be back...because they're bogus.  Too bad, because it's a pretty cool place.

Work nearby and thought we would give this place a shot. Kinda sorry we did. We ordered the crab cheese wonton sushi, it had a decent flavor while eating it, but the after taste was horrible like old fish. Also ordered the classic ramen bowl, the star of that was the hard boiled egg. The chicken was rubbery, the noodles pasty and lacked flavor. I usually find at least something I like and here is no different - the iced tea was fantastic! All in all, I don't recommend this place. The staff is nice but the food is substandard at best!

Giving this spot two stars because of one thing: the service.  Came to eat for the first time since it transitioned into the Camby from the Ritz Carlton. The ambiance was nice and the food was good, on par with what I expected of a place like this. Our server on the other hand was horrible! There were 3 tables in the whole restaurant and it took us 40 minutes to get him to take our order. Then we got our food and he hadn't even brought water.  I may come back and give it another try, but for a place that's trying to establish its spot on map, they should step it up.
