If I I could I would not give it any stars. Please pick another gym! I have yet to be satisfied in anyway with this gym! At the end of the day it's about how much they can make off of you! One class for beginners  was never thought some of the basic thing which made me feel like I was always doing something wrong. If I needed anything to make my workout better of course it came with a price. At the end of the day my account was overdrawn each month I was there which they stated would go toward my next month payment. At some it was over a$100 and the manager could not figure out why yet to help with the refund. Many other gyms to pick from please pick another that has a bit better standards regarding there accounts!!
