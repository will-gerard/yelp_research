I loved the beef bone soup I got to go from here and I found the crankiness of the owner to be charming. This is a low key campus joint so what do you expect?? Actually, the owner was fairly nice to me and smiled, probably because he figured I wasn't a student. It looked like most of the foreign students in there were also ordering soups (could have been because it was really chilly).  The soup came with a large portion of rice and only 3 kimchees (not really banchan). Oddly enough, there were somen noodles in mine but the soup was deeply flavored and I was more than satisfied it. I can't wait to come back to IL to get another bowl of this soup, its my comfort food when I am on the road for recruiting.

This is my parents' favorite place to eat when they come to Phoenix so we dropped by twice on our family vacation. The owner/proprietress convinced my mom (in mandarin) to let her pick the dishes for our first dinner so we didn't even know what would be coming. The cold smoked duck was sooo delish as was the special mountain leafy green with bean curd shreds (all minced fine and not on the regular menu). There was also a shredded pork dish with bamboo (excellent) and a pickled vegetable with fish soup. The soup wasn't really my thing because it was heavily seasoned with white pepper which I hate but the rest of my family said it was exceptional.  Our second visit was for lunch before heading off to the airport for the return trip. I could have eaten the entire scallion pancake myself as well as the cold spicy pork belly dish. Luckily, we ordered two orders of fried potstickers because those were delicious as well. We also had some tasty steamed pork buns but I was stuffed at that point.  If you really want to experience authentic shanghai food, let the staff order for you, you won't regret it.

I was disappointed in the quality of the pastries at this place. We stopped in for a late afternoon sweet snack and were delighted at the selection of cakes in the case. I chose a raspberry mouse and chocolate which was dry perhaps it was old? My mom had a hazelnut and chocolate mousse cake on praline crust which was also dry although the crust was good. My sister's strawberry shortcake was the only seemingly fresh pastry we ordered that day.  The prices here are on the high side and they won't even serve you tap water in a glass if you request. You must purchase the bottled water so don't expect to save a few $$ on your drink.  Maybe I came on an off day because it looks like several other reviewers didn't have the freshness problem I did.

This is a beautiful nursery with a broad selection of plants. I came in mid-January and was surprised at how big the selection of plants was so early in the season. You'd think such a well stocked and esthetically pleasing nursery would be very pricey but I found them to be reasonable. Actually, I found them to be more reasonable than Baker.  I am not a rose growing expert but Berridge has the largest selection I have ever seen. Many are the tall potted variety but they also have some growing in trenches that they dig up when you pick yours out.  They do not have a huge selection of organic fertilizers or seeds here, which is the only reason why I am giving them less than 5 stars. Unfortunately, I do not live in AZ otherwise I would love to come back and check out the veggies in the spring.

We traveled to Phoenix from Albuquerque looking for something different than your ordinary Japanese restaurant. This little gem exceeded our expectations! The low key, casual post-donut shop vibe was just what we wanted for our Monday lunch. Yes, a Japanese restaurant open on a Monday at lunch!! The owners were really cute and nice and the chef (wife) peeked her head out of the kitchen and asked how our meal was.   My mom and I had the minced tuna with green onion donburis which came with soup, salad, a skewer of chicken, and gyoza. This was a BIG meal and very authentic all for about $12. My sister had the salmon and ikura donburi which was also excellent as well and ikura donburis are hard to find nowadays...My dad had their special ramen bowl, whose name escapes me and was very tasty.  Overall, I am a huge fan of this place and was surprised at the authenticity and home style cooking. Don't expect anything fancy, just good honest home style Japanese food with no frills. This is definitely a local's joint and a great value.

You would only go to this place for the food, as the ambience and decor is non existent. But the food is worth checking out if you are looking for something different. We were in town for a house hunting trip and I found this place on Yelp. We visited on a Saturday night fairly early around 6pm.  When I went to Hawaii many, many years ago, I fell in love with Lau Lau which is a chunk of pork steamed with spinach in a banana leaf. Aloha Kitchen had these as part of a special that night which also came with kalua pork, saimen noodles, rice, and lomi salmon (salmon sashimi salad with tomatoes). This was a huge dish and could have fed both my husband and I. All of that food was only like $10! I am not an expert on Hawaiian food but it was very tasty. My husband had the other special which was teriyaki chicken and coconut shrimp. He was very happy with his dish as well.   This place is a great bargain. We were on a per diem and for under $25 we were both WELL FED as the portions are very generous here. All of the food is served on/with disposable plates and utensils. But don't let that turn you off, the food is worth trying out.

This place far exceeded my expectations and is far better than staying at a Hilton Garden Inn or Hampton Inn. This place is QUIET, CLEAN and for the money, you can't beat this place. It includes a HOT breakfast each day which means real eggs and hash browns served to you at a sit down cafe. This alone saves about $10 per person per day while traveling!  This place has THREE pools (nice if you don't want to hang out near the bar), basketball court, laundry facilities, restaurant, plenty of parking, free wi-fi, full kitchen, great housekeeping service (they cleaned our dirty dishes!), and a very courteous front desk staff.  The only downsides were the dim lighting and not enough wastebaskets or tissue boxes. But for the peace and quiet, I'll take that trade-off anyday!!   This place would be excellent for hosting reunions because of the pools, basketball courts and several sets of bbq's on central courtyards.  If you are looking for a fancy place, this isn't it. But it is an incredible bargain, comfortable, and very quiet.

Came here straight from the airport in need of some strong coffee and a sandwich to kick off our house hunting trip. I have been wanting to visit a Lee's for a long time but could never seem to get there until now. It was worth the wait and now that I am moving to Chandler, I can go whenever I want!!  I am a huge fan of banh mi and my husband likes them too but is new to the concept. So I ordered him the grilled pork vietnamese sandwich and ordered myself a pork and pate one. The combo sandwich I wanted was not available but this did not dampen my experience. The bread the sandwiches are served on is special. Its creamy, flavorful, soft on the inside, slightly crisp on the outside. The meats inside are very good but they take second stage to the bread in my opinion. My mom complains that they skimp on the fillings but I didn't find that to be the case for me. A sandwich with bread that good would be overwhelmed by too much meat. For me, I felt the sandwich was balanced perfectly with the right amount of meat, pickled veggies, cilantro, and jalapeno.  Of course, we ordered the iced coffees which hit the spot and got us energized for our long afternoon. Next time I would order a large one because they really pack the cup full of crushed ice (this makes it nice and cold) so you don't get as much coffee.

This is a pretty small place but very fresh and delicious. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because the portions were small but it was also cheaper than your average Korean restaurant.  We opted for bbq ordering the kalbi, shrimp, and beef brisket. The brisket was soooo amazing, sliced ultra thin and super marbled with fat. It just about melts in your mouth and I wished the portion was about 4 times as big as it was. The kalbi was standard but the shrimp was disappointingly tiny. There were only 6 smallish shrimps in our order.  The side dishes were tasty but only about 6 were served. We weren't served any soup either! Overall, the food was really good but I wished the portions were bigger!!

I come to Phoenix a couple of times a year and made it a point to drive all the way up to Glendale to eat at CJB. I was a huge fan of the food and I really did love the huge wooden tables they used to have. I am grateful the place didn't totally disappear, but I did prefer the old restaurant to this new one. Thankfully, the quality of the food doesn't seem to have been affected.  The new location has much smaller tables which makes grilling harder. Also, the grill isn't gas anymore, it seems to be infrared or something that takes a long time to heat up.  My favorite dish on the menu is the melt-in-your mouth beef brisket. Paper thin slices of this meat are served partially frozen for you to grill table top. Be sure to grill this right away because when it thaws, it is hard to unroll to grill flat. We also had pork bellies, kal bi, and chicken. The chicken was the surprise of the night! It was so flavorful, I will have to order that again next time I come. We also had a combination soon tofu soup to share. This was really flavorful and I recommend it along with all of the food mentioned above.

I ended up here unplanned as we were driving around the neighborhood with 30 minutes to spare before attending an open house event. Not many places are open at 11:30am on a sunday morning that you can get a quick bite but luckily for us, Picazzo's came to our rescue.  This restaurant wasn't at all what I expected. It turned out the Picazzo's is a super healthy Italian place with lots of salads and an extensive juice bar. I recently got onto the juicing kick and opted for the Green Machine juice. It could have used more apple to sweeten it but it was fresh and delicious.  As I said, we only had 30 minutes so the waitress recommended salads for us. I chose the kale salad and immediately I knew it was going to be a good one. The kale was the darkest kale I have ever seen and super frilly (maybe this is a special type of kale that isn't available at Whole Foods?). The greens were dressed with a lemony dressing and sprinkled with almonds. It was delicious and super good for you. My husband had a cranberry salad which he also enjoyed. You can get kale substituted in any salad free of charge as an investment in your health.  I loved the super healthy selection of food, not that I don't like my greasy deep fried food either. But if you need to get your vegetables in and are craving some extra fiber in your diet, please go to Picazzos.

I wish I lived in AZ so I could do all my meat shopping at Von Hanson's. This review is mainly for the excellent beef jerky.  A friend in MN bought me some of their peppered beef jerky which spoiled me for all beef jerky. I knew I could never eat the crap you buy in the grocery store EVER AGAIN after eating Von Hanson's homemade variety. So when I knew I was going to be in the Phoenix area, I knew I had to stock up.  Their beef jerky actually tastes like real beef and has the chewy texture you would expect real dried meat to have. It does not have anything in common with the softer artificially flavored varieties you find at your grocery store and is actually more affordable! A tiny pack of crappy stuff costs $8 whereas you can get a full 1 lb. for $18 at Von Hanson's.   Since I was traveling I had to limit myself to non perishable items or items that could make it without a refrigerator for a few hours. I bought the peppered jerky and passed on the Cajun flavored one. They have a large selection of sausage sticks too. I purchased the smoked beef and hot jalapeno sticks which are delicious! They are smooth on the inside and don't ooze orange fat as you are eating them.

My family and I had a terrible dim sum experience at China Chan on a Thursday afternoon. They were out of practically everything we ordered and what we did end up with was sub-par at best. The service was terrible and to tell you the truth, for what we got this place is overpriced.  Here is a list of what we managed to sample: steamed shrimp & beef rice rolls, shrimp dumplings, bean curd rolls, chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, sweet white sponge cake, egg tarts, cocktail buns, and fried sesame balls. All of these items ranged from barely edible to barely acceptable.  Perhaps China Chan does better on the weekends when there is more dim sum traffic and the food is fresher, but I wouldn't choose to come back here. Out of the 3 dim sum restaurants I have tried in PHX, this one ranks dead last for every reason.

We just bought a house in Chandler and were looking for a local vietnamese restaurant. What do my fellow Yelpers say? Try out Pho Chandler!  I generally stick to the pho combinations with brisket, tendons and tripe. The service was super quick and within 5 minutes I had my steaming bowl of goodness which was a solid 4 stars (I have had better pho a couple of times). The beef brisket was tender and plentiful. The tripe was a little chewy but had plenty of flavor left in it. One of the pet peeves I have with some pho places is the quality of the bean sprouts. But at Pho Chandler, there was no problem. The sprouts were fresh and trimmed. My husband had the veggie pho which I didn't even know existed.  We are pleased we can get our pho fix so close to our new home. It is a clean restaurant and the service is good. The prices are on par with other pho restaurants.

Stayed in Tempe for several nights on a house hunting trip. One of the nights happened to be NFL conference finals night so I wanted to get take out and watch the games instead of going out. I sent my husband out for the pasties and chicken wings.  He is a pretty conservative eater so he opted for the Oggie (traditional pasty) while I went for the Pilgrim (Thanksgiving style). The pasties were huge and still steaming hot when they arrived at the hotel room. The Pilgrim was served with the red wine gravy (delicious) and cranberry sauce. I thought the crust was as perfect as pasty crust could possibly be. Not too thick and braided along the edge. The filling was so moist and well composed. The meat wasn't dried out and the sweet potatoes really added flavor. My husband said he preferred my pastie to his.   I was not enamored with the tandoori chicken wings. They were caked in tandoori paste and soggy. I would not recommend these. They were also super spicy.  Since we are moving to the area, we will be coming back to try out the many varieties as well as the pasty dessert!

The Magic Noodle was our first stop after getting off the plane for our AZ weekend and we were pleasantly surprised at how good the noodles were. In particular the "seafood with cream sauce" dish which sounds totally disgusting (and not much better looking) but was the best dish of the day. Of course, be sure to order all of your noodle dishes with the hand pulled noodle option.  Back to the seafood with cream sauce dish: I am not a fan of cream sauces. I hate alfredo, bechamel, etc. but this cream sauce was the BEST medium to bring out the natural sweetness and full bodied flavor of the hand pulled noodles. This cream sauce did not have any cheese in it and the seafood wasn't the highest quality either (just ignore the seafood). Our young waiter recommended this dish as the best of the house and my mom decided to give it a shot. No one touched the dish until we ate all the other food and were forced to acknowledge its presence.  Overwhelmingly, this dish became our favorite. Luckily it was generously sized so everyone got enough.  The hand pulled noodles were thinner than I expected, about ramen width sized and I enjoyed watching the noodle man smack and twist them into my order.  Something I could never do and the packaged stuff just doesn't compare. If you really want to appreciate the flavor and texture of these noodles, I highly recommend trying out the seafood cream dish.   Overall, this place is a bargain. Besides the above referenced dish, we had the oxtail noodle soup (not a lot of meat in it although the broth was delicious), stir fried noodles with XO sauce and a fried fish special. All were very good!  I always rate small hole-in-the-wall places solely by the food because service is usually dismal and this place was no different.

Having done some research on Yelp before traveling to Phoenix for a long weekend, we were looking for a good Chinese restaurant near the airport. I was lured to this place by Mark D.'s review because he said it was in a Fry's marketplace and I was thinking he meant the electronics store (there aren't any Fry's grocery stores in NM)!! Despite the letdown of not being able to shop for electronics right after lunch, I am still a fan of this place.   We got there at the odd hour of 2:30pm but still got served with good food. I had requested crispy (both sides fried) noodles with chicken and vegetables (only the vegetarian version is listed on the menu) which was delicious. The chicken with salted fish fried rice and beef, onion and pepper rice noodles with black bean sauce was also very good. The only dish that I would not recommend is the sauteed choy sum which was par-boiled too long and a bit too soft for my liking.

This place is a little gem of a neighborhood spot. This place was a nice way to end our house hunting trip. The staff is super nice and they gave us samples of their treats as we were waiting for our food. They have free WiFi and are fine with you hanging out for a couple of hours as we did.  I was looking for something light as I had too much ice cream the night before and was feeling sorta quesy. I opted for the vegetable curry crepe which turned out to be a tasty crepe full of beets and parsnips with a slight hint of curry. The vegetables were tender but not overcooked. The crepe came with a garnish of some turnip pickle (absolutely fantastic) and a parmesan cheese crisp. The portion size of the crepe was perfect for lunch and my stomach felt miles better after lunch. My husband had the chicken pesto crepe which he enjoyed.  For dessert we had the popular vanilla custard crepe with strawberries. The star of this dish was the crepe itself whose flavor and texture really came through. Many crepes are all about the filling, and this one had a delicious vanilla custard but it wasn't overly sweet. It was almost like a whipped cream.  While we were waiting for our savory crepes, the kitchen sent out a sample of their sage teacake with a fruit compote. The flavor of the sage really came through and was scrumptious. While waiting for dessert, the kitchen sent out samples of their homemade snickerdoodles with little milk tins.  Overall, this place is warm and inviting, The staff makes you feel at home and like you are a welcomed customer. This is rare these days. The only drawback to this restaurant is the bathroom is in the kitchen area so you have to be escorted there.
