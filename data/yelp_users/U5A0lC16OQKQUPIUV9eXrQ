Stayed at a hotel across the street so of course had to try this place. Did a pickup order. Unfortunately, I forgot to post all of the pictures I had. But I can't recall anything really good or really bad about the food. So that's usually good sign on my end. The to-go presentation was definitely lacking but tasted good. Understandable because most people would dine in. Price was what is expected of fine Italian.   Location, as others have pointed out is tucked into the base of the Hearst. Easy enough to access.

Huge portions. A little out of control to be honest. If you're staying in downtown Phoenix, then I suggest you do the 30 minute one way walk.   Grits were exactly how they listed them- plain. With a slab of margarine. I prefer butter. And they really were gritty no smoothness. Eggs were fried in margarine as well. So I'd stay away from it next time.   A lot of carbs: waffles were soggy. They need to stand up to the chicken but didn't. Brother ordered the biscuits and they were giant fist sized and smothered in gravy.   Chicken with their hot sauce was the best thing there. Definitely would advise to stick with just the chicken unless you're a fan of margarine and/or massive amounts of carbs. I love the concept of chicken and waffles (live in LA with the famous Roscoe's, which I don't recommend either) but the waffles always seems to disappoint. It's chicken and waffles. Not chicken with pancakes.   Parking is plentiful. Also have a bike station around the corner if biking is more your thing than the walk/drive.   Remember: food adventures are out there. So eat 'em up and report back to me! :)

Stayed here just for the comp'd nights. The rooms remind me of something you'd find at a motel. Check-in was really slow. Seems pretty quiet on the hotel floors, which is the best thing I can say about this place. I guess they're fine for being on the strip and one of the least expensive casinos to stay at. But if you're able to pay a little extra, then I recommend that you do so.

Pet friendly with no extra charge/fees. Most higher starred hotels charge a fee. So I'm surprised when I asked the hotel staff that they don't and all that you have to do is sign a waiver stating that you won't leave the dog unattended in the room.   Hotel has multiple board meeting rooms. During the duration of my stay, MRS, an international company was in town for their large convention.  Olympic length pool with gym overlooking. Jacuzzi off to the side before you hit their outdoor bar and grill area that has an intermeshed herb garden for their restaurant downstairs.   Rooms are decent sized. Protection is based on needing a room key to access guest floors. Parking is $19 for self-parking and a few dollars more for valet. Some rates have parking included.  Large lobby with a business center to use computers, print out boarding passes, get a coffee, hang out, drink infused waters, or grab a beer.   Overall, great experience during MLB Spring Training. Only an average of 20 minute drive away from Camelback Ranch.  #gododgers

Met a group of coworkers here for dinner. Multiple dinner parties being held. So it's a large enough restaurant.   Only had a light dinner salad because I had a large lunch. But very flavorful. Unfortunately they didn't have ingredients for the drink I ordered. So ended up just having water. But the rest of my party enjoyed their dishes and drinks.   Gets a little loud. Also has another level for a bar. Heard it's another large area for larger gatherings to mingle.  Tip: Make sure you carefully review your check though. They originally charged me for the drink that was not served. Understandable though because she most likely put the order in, then found out that they had none, and simply forgot to remove it.   Remember: food adventures are out there. So eat 'em up!

Fish isn't as fresh as the high rating would suggest. Uni looks like it was the last scrapes. I think people drink more than eat here. Sat at the bar to watch the sushi be made. Not as open as most sushi bars. Couldn't really see much. Like they're hiding something. Came over because it was in walking distance to my hotel and open late. Two entrances/exits.  To be honest, I had to go to another sushi spot the following day to make up for what was lacking at this place. Maybe it's average for Charlotte. But subpar from Cali. #truth  Remember: food adventures are out there. If at first you don't succeed, then try another place. Ha!

Love how their menu basically blasts TexMex as giving Mexican food a bad representation. Now this is authentic Mexican food. Not some heavy just because we're Americans portion.   Ordered a lonches. Because they wanted to be different from a torta. But even in the mindset of what a standard torta is, these lonches are WAY BETTER. Bread sustains itself to the fillings (instead of falling apart or soaking up stuff like a torta bread does. Ordered shark. So that was different. There was a freshness to it due to a cucumber to give it a nice crispness to each bite. Brother ordered the al pastor lonche and he thoroughly enjoyed it as well. Girlfriend ordered the mole quesadilla. And yes yes yes! Delivered on the multiple layers of spices within the mole. Man, have I always only had flat moles (such a sad fact). Now, I can imagine not being able to order mole from anywhere else ever again! Eeeek! But do give it a try. Oh, and this quesadilla looked more like a dessert. But nope. A nice balance between the spices of the mole, meat (chicken), and cotija cheese that's sprinkled over it.   Also tried their horchata. Once again, flavors up the Ying-yang! Theirs nuts, melons, freshly mashed strawberries. So definitely not your typical Americanized Mexican restaurant.   Tip: don't park in the front. It's extremely difficult to back out into the busy traffic street. Especially if you're alone. Somewhat more doable if you have someone standing outside the car giving your a thumbs up.  Remember: food adventures are out there. So eat 'em up!

Convenient for a quick lunch. Tastes fresh. Like any other chain location though. Very much like food court style dining. Seating for about 12-20 depending on each "party." To be honest, felt a little bit like eating at an airport vendor but better? If that makes sense. Because of the size, convenience, prices, etc. Very much like all surrounding vendors though (strip of just food options).  Remember: food adventures are out there. So eat 'em up!

Best part is that it's connected to Cartel. So you get the best of both worlds for the pickiest of couples. Coffee and/smoothie.   But let's move on to this spot only. It was morning when we arrived after a quick workout at the hotel and my group wanted coffee. I'm not a huge fan of coffee to be honest. I love the smell but dislike the taste and end up masking it with creamer and raw sugar. Luckily my girlfriend found this place, as a bonus because they were more concerned with finding Cartel instead. Was a little hungry so ordered something "light." Their acai bowl. Very fresh with minimal sugars added. Sugars were most likely already in the acai mix that they use, can't do much about that. Shaved coconut on top for a nice tropical taste. Girlfriend had the breakfast burrito which was vegetarian. Looked filling. Didn't try it because the acai bowl was bigger than I thought it would be (slightly larger than normal). Inside decor is cute. Lots of seating and possibly wifi. Saw a couple people working on their laptops.   Walked here so not sure if there's parking. But who needs parking if you're visiting the downtown area? Just walk everywhere. Should be able to walk anywhere in the vicinity within 30 minutes tops.   Remember: food adventures are out there. So eat 'em up!
