Was in the office a couple of days ago and a group of us went to this restaurant especially for their pastrami sandwich. For $10, I order the pastrami on marbled rye, no cheese, fries and a pickle wedge. My buddy ordered the Skyscraper, which is a stack of corn beef and pastrami. YUMMY! The pastrami is cut thinly and is pretty tasty. The whole sandwich is so fresh that when you bite down, it just melts in your mouth.  This is definitely one of my favorite lunch time restaurants.

I used to go there for lunch before I retired. I brought my wife there a couple of times, and she loves it, but it's such a long way from our home.  This restaurant is always clean. There was an employee mopping the floor after the lunch crowd.    My favorite is the Arroz A La Valenciana. All the vegetables are fresh and the pupusas are excellent.

If you want to look for Paradise Bakery, they moved to a smaller location in Concourse C. The good thing is that they have three registers to try and move customers in and out quickly.  I just got coffee, water and a zucchini nut muffin.  Not as good as going to their restaurants, but their food is still on the mark.

I had several restaurants on my mind: Flo's, Elephant Bar and at the last minute decided to go to Macaroni Grill at around 6 PM. The parking lot was full, all the tables on the patio were occupied so I dropped my wife off to put our name in.  After parking, I walked into the restaurant and she wasn't there, they had all ready seated her. We sat in a couples booth and could watch the cooks and waiters picking up their orders.  We ordered the stuff mushrooms, but after a long wait our waitress came by and told us they had to start a new batch. She asked if we still wanted them, of course not. I'm glad she asked, 'cause we all ready had our fill of their delicious bread.  My wife ordered the house wine, 1/2 insalata , Margherita pizza and I had the Shrimp Portofino which looked small but very filling. Our waitress, Jess, was a little slow in bringing us a take home box and the check, but was friendly.

We haven't been to the EB for some time. Found out that they NOW take reservations. The place was hopping and we noticed that there were a lot of senior diners. I'm not knocking them...'cause I have my "senior discount card".  Both of the women in my life ordered the wedge salad. It looked like half of the head of lettuce. I ate my wife's half and it was crisp and cold with ranch dressing and a sprinkle of bacon bits....I forgot to finish this and can't remember what I had...so much for us seniors.

We love the food here 'cause it tasty and affordable. The place was packed and we had to wait about 30 minutes even though they told us 15-20 minutes.  We started off with wedge salad which was okay. My daughter, had the Classic French dip and substituted the french fries for the 'wedge salad'. My wife had the Wok-Fired Mongolian Beef with fried rice. She ate half and brought the rest home of dinner the next night. I had the Shrimp Scampi in lobster sauce which came with linguini style pasta. There was plenty of shrimp and for me, too much sauce. I couldn't taste any lobster in the sauce.   The service was good especially on a Saturday night.

It was my turn to pick a restaurant, so based on the reviews from YELP, I choose this one. We ordered the Mu Shu Pork, crispy duck and Peking Pan Fried noodles.  The service was wonderful and courteous. Now, when they bring out the hot tea without asking and its complimentary, that is old school and what I am used to. The crispy wonton skins was an added plus.  The waitress made up the mu shu pork with the pan cakes. They used a lot of bean sprouts which took away some of the flavor but it still was good. As for the Peking Pan Fried noodles, I guess I like the Hong Kong style of noodles better which is more crisp. It looked like they added the Chow King noodles from the can and had the sauce soften them. Again, there were a lot of bean sprouts in the dish. The crispy duck was good, but my wife thought it was a little dry. I loved it. Told her she should have ordered the Roast Duck instead.  To top it off, we were given a fortune cookie and a wonton puff  with honey inside and powdered sugar on top. Nice way to end the meal. BTW, I had enough left over to enjoy lunch the next day.

We celebrated our 33rd wedding anniversary one evening and the experience was unforgettable.  My wife enjoys a good steak and so, I thought of Fleming s. I've been to Ruth Chris', but heard so much about Fleming s that I decided to give them a try.  From the moment we walked in, we were treated like regulars. We sat at a booth which was nice and comfy. Our server was Nick who was very friendly, pleasant and  was very knowledgeable, but he cleared more utensils that he needed to and forgot to bring the two knives that were removed.  We weren't rushed and had enough time to decide on our meal. My wife started with a glass of Pinot Noir and since I'm allergic to alcohol, I had water.  The appetizer, Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes was not jumbo, but the crab and sauce flavors were. The salad, Lettuce Wedge, you were given a slice of bacon and blue cheese which you had to crumble yourself and my wife's Modern Caesar Salad was excellent. Main course, Newport Filet and Main Filet with a side of sauteed mushrooms were cooked to perfection and the button mushrooms are the ones I like instead of the sliced ones.  We followed the evening meal with the Turtle Pie and coffee which capped off a wonderful anniversary dinner. By the time we finished our first cup, Nick was right there filling our coffee cups again.  The manager came to our table several times to check on us, was friendly and gave us an incentive to come back which we will definitely use. We only saw our server once during our meal. The bus boy was terrific, he brought our missing pair of knives and kept our water glasses filled and cleared our table for us. Everyone there was so friendly and was not your typical stuffy high-end restaurant atmosphere.

Can't beat the value of this combination of golf and steak dinner.  We started at 3:44 and was able to get in 16 holes. As for the steak, I asked for medium rare and it came out raw-rare.

We decided to have early dinner and since we were around Kierland Commons we decided to eat here. I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta which was crispy to begin with. The sauce soften the crispy chicken, but the flavor was wonderful. I think the plate contained three chicken breasts beaten til they were flat. The mashed potatos was a bit thick and the asparagus was cooked to perfection. I saved half of my dinner for the next day. My daughter had the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Sandwich and switched from the french fries to the Sweet Potato Fries. She, too, brought half of her entree home. My wife enjoyed the  Chicken Enchilada and substituted the rice for black beans. All our food was yummy. Alana, our server, was great. She kept our lemonade glasses filled and was very knowledgeable. For dessert, I took home the Resses Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake 'cause it had all the ingredients that I love. It took me two days to finish it off. YUMMY!!!

We decided to have an early dinner (5:00 PM) and since we haven't been to this place for some time...here we are. Found parking in front of the restaurant and we ate out side 'cause there was hardly any wind and there were lots of places to sit . I had the Cuban Sandwich with Caesar Salad and my wife had the SkinnyLicious Chicken salad. I had my first  Cuban Sandwich at the Miami Int'l Airport and it doesn't compare to the one I had here; maybe because it was at an airport. This one had lots of pork and ham and was darn good too.  I didn't think I could finish it, but I dug down deep and it was gone. We ended up taking a home a slice of Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple cheesecake to split between us.  All their food is great. Service was exceptional. We'll be back.

Always a good place yo eat. Had their Seared Ahi tataki salad which was just the right amount. Only issue, they tossed the salad with way too much dressing. So if you order it, get the dressing on the side. Service and servers are always accommodating.

We ventured out to Flo's for dinner tonight. Met my daughter and her girlfriend Kylie. My wife ordered won ton soup and chicken pot stickers; Janine ordered the Chile Orange Chicken; Kylie, the Pad Thai with Shrimp and I chose the Basil and Black Bean Beef.  When they came out with our food, they hadn't cleared the table of soup bowls and used plates and the server was standing there waiting for the table to be cleared. We ended up gathering them all up and handing them to the server. What's with that, it's NOT our job.  As for the food, the soup was tasty with enough won tons. It looks like they used pork fat, to give the soup flavor. I think the Vietnamese do the same thing in their cooking. Both the orange chicken and beef was excellent except, there wasn't enough beef for second helpings.   The Pad Thai wasn't prepared that well, the chicken on the skewer had too much peanut sauce which made it taste mushy. The noodles were over cooked and I couldn't tell if it was noodles or tofu but there was a good portion of shrimp.  I've had better meals and service there...but, I still am a fan of Flo's and I'll be back to try it again. If you get there between 3 and 7 PM the appetizers and drinks are half-off. Can't beat that with a chopstick.

My daughter and I stopped in for lunch. For me, it was my first time for lunch. Have been there many times for dinner.  The server was polite but the lunch was fantastic. We were brought wonton chips and a salad. I had the Shrimp pan fried noodles which is the BEST in the valley and my daughter had the Szechwan Orange Chicken with white rice. Our meal came out  really fast. My daughter has only an hour for lunch and the service was amazing.  The portions were not as large as dinner, but we could have made a dinner meal from the amount of food that was brought out. Everything was tasty and filling. My daughter brought half her meal home.  By far, this is one of our favorite Asian restaurants.

Brought my sister from California and she loved the flavors of the different dishes. We started off with Lettuce Wraps, potstickers and Kirin Light, 'cause it was happy hour and you can't beat the prices.  The restaurant has been nicely remodeled. We loved the concrete floors, but now they are covered with laminated flooring which looks like real wood.  The place was crowded for a Thursday night and they seemed to be short on staff. Our order consisted of Basil and Black Bean Beef, Cashew Chicken, Twice cooked Pork and Pan Fried noodles with Shrimp. Every dish had great flavors, but I was disappointed with the Pan Fried Noodles. They must have a new chef because the Pan Fried Noodles wasn't spread around the plate, it was in a block covered with all the sauces, vegetables and shrimp. I know it really picky of me, but the way it used to be presented was beautiful, where you can see the crispy pan fried noodles. Our server Katie was attentive and the other staff keep the water flowing in our glasses. We always come back, even though it's a 15 mile journey one way.

Decided to try this venue rather than driving down to their other restaurant on Camelback. We figured we'd have a better chance of being seated here because the other venue is quite small. There is also ample parking. At around 7PM the place started filling up. We were pleasantly surprised at the amount of space this restaurant had. It was decorated as if we were in Cuba. The server was polite but hardly made conversation, just asked us how the food was and was there anything that she could get us. We started with Sangria and the Testones, which is grounded green plantains which I thought was a bit dry even with the garlic sauce. We didn't know that it could either be served with a Black Bean dip. As for the Sangria, for me it was potent. Just remember that instead of it mixed with red and white wine you can substitute the white wine with champagne. We weren't even told about those options. I tried the Sailor's Paella and it had all sorts of seafood: crab, mussels, clams, fish, calamari, scallops, white asparagus and rice. It was served in the pot that it was cooked in, so be careful 'cause you can't dig into until the temperature lowers. The meal wasn't overly salty and was very tasty. If you order this item, don't eat lunch before you come. My wife ordered the Chicken Chicarrones which was good but a little dry. She took half of them home and had them for lunch. To top off the meal, I ordered the Flan which was excellent except for the cinnamon cookie on top of the flan. It was different and I left the restaurant satisfied.

Second time I played the south course in a week. Course is in great shape and the staff is helpful and friendly. The second time I played here, the putting holes were plugged, maybe for the anticipation of rain?? Just remember the greens are not like the practice putting surface.

It was my birthday and I wanted to have sushi for dinner. So my daughter picked this restaurant via Yelp and it was an AWESOME time at this restaurant. We were seated and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Great attitude and personality. I ordered my favorite, Chirashi. The slices of fish were generous but there was too much sushi rice, but over all it was outstanding. We ordered an tempura appetizer and seaweed salad. The seaweed was chopped up and hard to get with chop sticks. The sushi was that my wife and daughter ordered was great. To top it off, at the end of the dinner, the lights were turned off and they brought me their orange cut in cute shapes with a candle in the middle. What a nice touch for someone that tried this restaurant for the first time. I was impressed with the dinner, atmosphere and delicious sushi!! Nice job! You have earned some new customers.

Tonight my wife and I came for dinner. I tried the Seafood Linguini which was new on the menu. It had scallops, shrimp and clams and was very flavorful. My wife had the Scallop Salad which was also excellent. Always enjoy our dining experience there. They also have the best Chianti...$30 for a bottle which I'll get for her birthday.

Stopped by a couple of nights ago at 6:30 PM and had to wait 50 minutes.They just don't have enough seats for us waiting patrons . So, we stood for about 30 minutes before we found seats in the waiting area. While waiting, they brought out complimentary pieces of cheese pizza. I've never had that happen before. When we finally got seated, it was difficult trying to read the menu that had red lettering. Good thing our friend had a flashlight. We had the thin crust pIzza and Caesar salad. With all the good food they serve, waiting in line for 50 minutes was nothing We've tried all the different locations and have never been disappointed.

I stopped in for lunch in early July and had their Sushi  lunch special. I wish I could remember what was in it. I know there were some nigiri and sashimi which came with soup and salad. For the price, I was totally satisfied. Will definitely be back.   We used a Groupon coupon back in June which was for $30 instead of $60. I'm waiting to see if that deal comes up again.

We decided to eat here because we had to stop off at Home Depot. Started off with the Edamame; ordering for our main course, Sashimi and Tempura, Dragon roll and Tempura Roll. Had hot tea and my wife had Kirin light.  The server was polite and attentive.  The food was awesome. Sashimi was fresh, Tempura was cooked to perfection and sushi rolls were amazing.   Our only issue was when we got the bill, they had overcharged us. They had me down for two dinners. And when using my coupon from Restaurant.com, they automatically added the 18% gratuity. I caught it after they had charged my credit card, but they politely made everything right.  Love their food and we'll be back.

The night before we were to leave on vacation, we decided not to cook dinner. So, we thought of Chipotle on Shea. I used the Chipotle app on my iPhone to order two burritos.   Drove over and picked up our dinner and headed home. When my wife cut into her burrito, it wasn't what she ordered. I wasn't going to drive 13 miles to have it changed. She couldn't eat the rice and sour cream. She scraped all of that stuff off.  I called Chipotle and talked to the manager he was gracious enough to make up for the mistake the next time I showed up. I just want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else.  I love their food and the only reason why I'm giving them two stars is because 'I've experienced better' from them.  The next time I go there, I'll watch them make my meals.Forget about ordering on the phone.

We love the fresh food here or at any Chipotle restaurant.   Had my usual, Carnitas Burrito and my wife had the burrito bowl. This time we selected our condiments and especially added the guacamole which made my burrito cold. Wish there was a microwave to heat the burro. But, all in all, the meal was filling and good.   This place reminds me of El Faro in San Francisco where I experienced a gastronomical burrito delight. This place is almost on par with them.  Maybe, Chipotle should look around for larger tortillas, so you can fit all the "goodies" without them bulging at the seams.

Last weekend, we visited this restaurant for dinner. I had finished golfing and ate a late lunch, 2:30 PM. We arrived at the restaurant at 6:30PM and it wasn't too crowded. We ordered their spinach salad, the European thin pizza and Deluxe combo mini-pizza for myself. They make awesome salads, fresh spinach topped with real bacon, hard boiled eggs, scallions, radishes, mushrooms, tomatoes and side of garlic bread. Had better garlic bread elsewhere. After the salad, I was getting pretty stuffed, but managed to finish the Deluxe Combo pizza which comes with pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers, onions, black olives & mushrooms. All in all, a great meal.

We couldn't believe this place was packed. Only one side of the restaurant was open so we had a 15 minute wait at 6 PM on a Thursday night. Just wondering if this was a run off of people leaving the Barrett Jackson event. Our server came to our table about 5 minutes after we sat down. We ordered the Skillet Queso, Southwestern Egg Rolls and Fish Tacos. Loved the idea of the warm chips and dip. My wife was scraping the skillet. The Egg Rolls were a hit with my wife and I loved my Fish Tacos which were in a soft flour tortilla. And the rice had just the right amount of citrus-chili. The beans didn't look like black beans, but they were luke warm and tasty. Our server was doing the best she could under the circumstances. Not enough servers for the amount of customers.  We'll be back.

Stopped off for a late dinner. Not very many patrons eating dinner, but more folks at the bar watching the football playoffs.  I ordered lemonade and my wife had the Dream Catcher light lager whcih she thought was heavy on the 'hops'. For dinner she ordered the Laredo and I had the 12 oz New York Strip.  Our server was knowledgeable and attentive. Our food came in a timely manner and was very good. I, especially, enjoyed my steak which was cooked medium rare, perfect. The vegetables sliced and cooked just right and the white cheddar mash potatoes was great. My wife's meal was also tasty. All in all, it was a very satisfying meal. We'll be back.

We played at 8:10 AM on the Saguaro course because the Chollo course is closed for the summer. At the turn around we got some awesome kosher hot dogs with house chips.   We started off on hole 10 while some groups started on hole 1. Sand traps were still wet from the morning watering which made it difficult to get out at times.

If you ever visit Fountain Hills, you must stop off for breakfast or lunch at this remarkable Bagel shop. My wife and I had lunch there. I ordered a peppered turkey with salami and pepper jack cheese on an everything bagel. The bagel was toasted just right...not burnt. They aren't stingy on the meats either. When you get your sandwich, you wonder how in the heck are you going to take a bite out of it, cause it's huge!! For the sides, instead of ordering chips, you can have potato, pasta or cucumber salad. My all time favorite is the cucumber salad which has cucumbers, scallions and celery. It is a refreshing salad.   This place is a whole lot better than going to Chompie's.

It was one of those lazy nights and we wanted something quick to eat. The place was surprisingly  busy. It's off of Shea Blvd. I don't order their noodles because the last time I had them, they were over cooked. The food came out HOT and we shared our plates. I ended up taking the leftovers home and had another meal the following day.

We decided to have Mexican food at Que Bueno's before the "trick or treat" kids came to the house.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food. The server was friendly and really paid close attention to us, filling our drink and water glasses without having to ask. I had the Sanchez Special which was two enchiladas, one with chicken and the other with shredded beef covered with a cream of mushroom sauce. The enchildadas were packed full of meat and flavor. My wife had the taco and enchilada which were just as good. Not a bad place for good food, friendly and fast service.

We've eaten here several times. My grand kids came to visit us for Christmas. They love pizza, so what better place to bring them to..Streets of NY. There were seven of us and our server was very patient and took care of the kids first with color crayons. We order the large chopped antipasto salad which I could eat as a meal but we split it four ways and was wonderful.  Our server was knowledgeable and accommodating. She really added he personality to the dining experience.  We ordered the extra large, 18" on a thin crust, but was told only 16" and below can be made with a thin crust.  All in all, it was a great place for the kids and adults to have dinner.

We have eaten breakfast here awhile back and it was pretty good. Reason for the 2 stars.  I happened to get a craving for apple pie. I stopped off, around midnight, and the place was busy enough to slow my order down. I ordered coffee and apple pie ala mode. MISTAKE!! The apple pie was really doughy and the coffee tasted like they created a new pot with OLD grounds. EGADS!! The best part was eating the ice cream.  I probably should have stopped off at Mickey Dees across the street, from what I hear their coffee has a lot more flavor than here.

After spending some time at the Book Fair, I wanted to stop off at this ice cream shoppe. All I knew, it was on 7th avenue.  We stopped in and the place was busy. Ordered a Root Beer float and my wife ordered a sundae. The server was very friendly and polite; checking on us to see if we needed more water or something else. The ice cream was really fresh and the root beer was fizzing to the last slurp. My wife had the sundae and the peanuts they used really added that extra touch.

We tried a BAG in Mesa and the food was so-so. My wife loves Mexican food and we usually try different restaurants around the valley. When she mentioned this one in Scottsdale, I was kinda hesitant.  But to my surprise, this restaurant rocks. The server was friendly and the manager came around to ask if we enjoyed our meal.  BEsides all that, the food was amazing. We will definitely be back

One of our favorite Mexican restaurants. My wife had a craving for Mexican food, so we stopped off here for dinner. We've know about this place prior to moving to AZ in 1998. The food is delicious. I keep forgetting to write a review and I started this one in November, 2011. I must have the comings of Alzheimer.  Anyway, this place used to be packed before Rancho De Tia Rosa opened. Now the customers are starting to frequent this place more because the last time we were there, both dining areas where 85% occupied.

I keep forgetting about this restaurant because it is so far south of us. We arrived at the restaurant around 6PM and we were the only customers and the staff was outside getting fresh air.  The decor is still the same, not much has been done. The sign outside is a bit faded. Our server was so-so, all business.  I had the two enchilada combo, One pork and chicken and I substituted the refried beans with black beans with red sauce. It was pretty tasty. Plenty of chicken and pork with each bite. There were more black beans on my plate with a couple of spoon fulls of Spanish rice. The little bit of diced lettuce, tomato and onions was refreshing.  My wife had a different combo, forgot what she ordered which came with the refried beans. Ask her why she didn't get the black beans and her answer was that sometimes the beans aren't thoroughly cooked, Mine were perfect.  This is the place to go if you just want good Mexican food.

What's happening to this place?? It looks as though they are going out of business.  I got a 'Living Social' coupon for my wife. Last Saturday, we went there to redeem it for 1 gal plants. There was zilch. The only plants they had were the lantana so we got four of them. This morning, my wife was going to plant them. I looked at them and they were D-E-A-D, DEAD. We are going to return them either today or tomorrow.  09/29/2011: Brought the lantanas back without any questions. One of the workers took us all the way in back of the nursery where they have hundreds. He explained that the worker who sold us the lantanas should have mentioned that they have more to choose from at the back and that the reason there were only a few in front is because they didn't want the excessive temperatures to kill them all. So now I am changing my rating to 4 stars from 2.

Had lunch with one of my colleagues on a Wednesday afternoon. Not crowded at 11:30, but after 12 Noon there were more patrons coming in.  I could not believe the size of the sandwiches. My friend ordered the Meatball Sandwich and a side of red potatoes. I had the Italian Combo with fruit. WOW, they both were huge and I finished mine and my friend took half the sandwich home.  The bread was super fresh. Service was okay.

Had to pickup glasses at Lenscrafters and since we were there, we decided to have dinner and take in a movie. We arrived about 5:30 and the place was almost empty. There happened to be only five tables occupied. My wife ordered the Lobster & Ahi Flatbread which had avacado, shaved red onion and the citrus aioli was wonderful. I had the Basil Pesto Linguine which was flavorful with the chicken and andouille sasauge. The noodles stuck together, maybe because of the grated cheese and cream sauce on top. I had to lift the noodles in the air to separate them. Loved the cream brule.

Our night out, last December, 2015, we decided to eat at Kona Grill. The service was a bit slow. We had ordered sushi and they brought it out at the same time as our entree. My wife loves the Maui Tacos and I had the Cubano sandwich. Overall, it was okay, but I would still patronize this restaurant.

We had a group of 3 couples. Two of us had the Deal Chicken coupon, $49 for $117.00. Our coupon gave us the tortilla chips with the salsa and fundido and two margaritas for each person. I thought for sure that after drinking the margaritas I would turn red from drinking all that alcohol. That's because I'm allergic to something in the alcohol whether it be beer, wine or the hard stuff. NOT!! These drinks were watered down. Average price for their margaritas came to $11.20. Maybe if we paid full price for our meals, it would have been much better.  My wife had the Pollo Margarita, stuffed chicken breast . which was a lot of food for her. She brought half of it home. I ordered the Grilled Salmon which was so GOOD that I cleaned the plate.   The next order was for dessert which I had the Flan and my wife had the Tuxedo cheesecake.  The service was excellent. maybe because the table we were at was reserved for 8:00. Our server. Samantha, was very knowledgeable and personable. She was on top of everything; water glasses were constantly filled and she would make sure all the finished plates were removed.

Since I was given a gift card, I decided to try Red Lobster...it's been over 10 years since I've eaten at this restaurant chain. All I can remember is the breaded shrimp, deep fried foods and the cheesy biscuit.  Well, now I know why it's been so long. It's either the chefs or the food.  Jen was our waitress who was very polite and professional. She took very good care of us. My wife had a Fat Tire draft which was pretty pricey at $5 a glass and their lemonade was $2.79 which was mostly all ice.  My wife and I ordered Caesar salad. the romaine lettuce was cold and crunchy with several croûtons. Should have had the dressing on the side. I had the Garlic Crab-and-Shrimp Pasta and my wife had the crab stuffed mushrooms.   My dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic crab. The shrimp was unshelled and plentiful, but the Parmesan cheese cream sauce overwhelmed the crab and shrimp and was probably the source of the saltiness. The linguine was cooked okay.  Would I go back...eh...most likely not.

Was on my way home and decided to stop off at a Starbucks. I've to this one once before. It's convenient and the gal at the drive-thru window was friendly. Glad to know they appreciate your patronage.a

My wife and I celebrated our 28th anniversary. Started of the Charles Krug sparkling champagne. My wife ordered the Lamb Shank, which I had the last time we came. (GO GET EM' BABE) and I had the sugar cure Smoked Duck breast which was sliced and surrounded the center of green vegetables. Our sides included the "Green Chile Mac & Cheese" which is the best and grilled asparagus. MMMM....YUMMY. And for dessert the Mexican vanilla bean Brulee. After that sumptuous meal we had to push ourselves away from the table. The service was excellent and always checking to see if we needed anything. Our water glasses were always kept full. If it wasn't for the champagne, our meal would have been under $65.

Celebrated my daughter's birthday. Had reservations at 6:30 and when we walked in, we were seated immediately. Our seats were opposite the bar and we were seating near a group of 6. The area is small, so all the conversations were bouncing off the walls and we had to lean in to talk to each other.   Our drinks consisted of Hot Tea $2, Petite Sirah $10 and a large bottle of Sapporo $8. Our waitress was very helpful and knowledgeable. When my tea got cold, she brought me a fresh pot of hot tea.    We started off with the Coconut Shrimp (6) and you can taste the freshness of the coconut and the mango-pineapple dipping sauce, and a sweet pickled jalapeño sauce were amazing.   Our entrees were the Spicy Cashew Beef, Pad Thai and Crispy Basil Chicken. The Spicy Beef was very flavorful and the sauce was excellent; Pad Thai was loaded with chicken and shrimp, the sweet paprika vinaigrette was a bit tart. I tasted all the dishes and I can see why the Crispy Chicken is a BIG hit.  Our dessert was Brulee and Pumpkin Custard. I've had larger portions of Brulee for $6. This one was in a ramekin. My Pumpkin Custard was really different which was served in a pumpkin that was 1/4 of the pumpkin. You ate everything down to the skin.  One thing to remember, they have a His/Her bathroom. Yes, singular, ONE bathroom which is in the bar area in the back right. Also, watch out for those aggressive bus boys. They are constantly clearing the plates from the table.

Our daughter gave us a gift card for Houston's, but found out we could use it at Bandera's. We made reservations for 5:30.  Don't even mess around to find parking. I guess I don't have the 'parking karma' yet. Tried looking for a space for 10 minutes and found valet parking kitty korner to the restaurant. When we got there, the hostess was pleasant and we were immediately seated. Our  server was polite and knowledgeable.  We started off with the Mac & Cheese. WOW, love the larger pasta and with the walnut cornbread crumbles it was delicious. I ordered the Snake River Farms American Style Kobe Tri Tip and Ceasar Salad. I forgot to tell the server that I wanted it medium rare. When I got it, it was not over cooked and the flavors just exploded. The Caesar salad had too much dressing for me. I should have had it on the side. The croutons were made from the cornbread, different, but it worked. My wife had the Kobe-style Steak and Enchilada Platter with Escabeche. She was blown away by the sauce on the enchilada and the flavors of the Escabeche. She ordered a side of Escabeche to go, that's how good it was. By the way, we had an intruder flying around our booth for the first 10 minutes. I hoping it died and didn't pester anyone else. We finished off our meal with Banana Cream Pie with Caramel and Crushed Chocolate. I didn't really need to order it, but I hadn't had one for some time. It was excellent . Now this is a place to bring your friends from out of town that you want to impress.

My wife and I stopped by for dinner and I knew she was curious about this place since we always wonder what the food was like.  The server was okay.  We started off with the crab cake appetizer which was okay. The crab cake was not as firm as I would have liked, but it was good enough to enjoy. It was placed on top of a garden green salad.  My wife ordered the medium rare Filet Mignon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fCJrZIzz85_8Uhf072QVnA?select=R1hK7SL71GbWVDCju15H2A and I had the medium rare prime rib. We both had the wedge salad which was the perfect size, not to large.     Asked her how she liked it, said it was burnt on the outside and a tad bit over cooked. As you can see, my was cooked perfectly.  We topped the meal off with a Banana Crepes. It was more like ice cream crepes because the two crepes were wrapped around vanilla ice cream. The bananas were on the bottom split in half and made into a tic tac toe design, topped with the ice cream crepes then a scope of vanilla ice cream was place on top. It was drizzled with caramel and chocolate sauces. I should have taken a picture of it, but I was so amazed at the dessert that I grabbed my spoon and started digging in.  The place was a bit loud and the table and booth arrangment reminded us of Houston's Restaurant.

Coming from the Aloha Fest, we didn't want to stand in line for food so we walked down Mill and chose this restaurant.  We ate outside, our server was here and there. My better half had the Lobster Shrimp Tacos and I had the Fish and Chips. My  wife loved her three tacos. Has to be one of the best seafood tacos that she has ordered. My fish and chips were cooked perfectly, with a light batter with some crunch to it and the cole slaw was okay. Unfortunately, we didn't have any of their brews, but maybe the next time we come back.

Before heading to ASU Gammage Theatre, we stopped in for dinner at 5:30 pm. Indoors was fully occupied and there were lots of empty tables on the patio. Sa I don't it was a we minute wait for indoor seating, so we come to see in the patio area. But when our hostess came back with to seat us, she told us there were seats with the high chairs/tables. Whew!!! It would have been a scorcher sitting in the sun. The umbrellas were of no use with the sun setting 'cause the umbrella stand doesn't bend. We had the 18" Clark Meat Pizza on a thin crust and a big Julius salad which is served nice and cold along with cold plates. The salad was fresh and crisp;  the pizza with just the right amount of meat came out hot and full of flavor. Matt was our server who doubled as a bartender and was helpful and personable along with the other staff. In the future.we wouldn't mind coming later for dinner, but I don't know if I could wait an hour to be seated. There was ample parking on the side and back of the building as hen we left at 6:30 PM.

Enjoyed a round of golf with good friends. The course was in great shape but after, we stopped in the Trophy Room for lunch. They have the best burgers in town.  I had the American Angus Burger with applewood smoked bacon. YUMMY!! All my other friends had the Albacore Tuna Salad, Southwest Burger and BBQ Beef.  All agreed it was a great lunch. No disappointments here.  Waitress was awesome, friendly and knowledgeable. Kept our water glasses full.  Place was busy because of people registering for their tournament and the lunch crowd.  We'll be back again soon.

We stayed at the Aria and tried to find breakfast there after 11 AM...we couldn't find one. Since my wife wanted to play roulette at New York, New York, we looked around at the Monte Carlo and found The Cafe where they have some items for Breakfast All Day. My wife had the BLT and I had Waffles and Fried Chicken. This was the first time I tried it and was disappointed at the fried chicken because I was expecting to have the bone in. It was chicken nuggets in the shape of  wings. Other than that, the Belgian waffle was crisp and I still was able to enjoy the meal. Now I have a standard to compare other Fried Chicken and waffles.

My daughter recommended this restaurant so we decided to give it a try. We met some friends for our annual New Year's dinner at 7:30 PM. We had to wait about 20 minutes for our table and the maitre d' comp us with chips and dip.  Three of is ordered the Chilled Shrimp Ceviche which was out of this world. I was expecting raw fish, but it had lots of shrimp with avocado, jicama and tomatoes. My wife had the TUNA TARTARE & GUACAMOLE made with fresh tuna, radish, soy-lemon vinaigrette and another person had the LGO CAESAR salad with whole leaf romaine, reggiano parmesan. The gals ordered a bottle of Pino Noir and two of us had lemonade which was a bit tart, but better than sweeten with sugar. For our entree, I had Chelsea's short ribs which I thought I was going to fight getting the meat off the bone. Surprise, surprise...this was the best tender short rib that I had in my LIFE. It was amazing and tasty. The prime rib and 'filet on the bone' looked "OH SO GOOD". There were no complaints whatsoever. The wives had two orders of the roasted chicken and lobster taco. One of the ladies found uncooked chicken towards the bone. She just told the Christina, our waitress and a few minutes later the maitre d' came by and gave her a $20 gift card. We ordered the apple tart and red velvet cake and coffee. The coffee was freshly made at our table with a 'coffee press'.   I was very impressed with the service and the food. We will definitely be back.

Wife took me to breakfast this morning. My daughter told us to try this place. So here we are at around 8:30 AM and the place is busy. Had to wait about 10 minutes for a table...beats waiting an hour on the weekends. If your a twosome, you have a faster chance of getting a table. I had their Salami Scramble with hash browns and sour dough. My wife had the Hog & Chick with home fries and sour dough.  The last time I had soppresata salami was when I was a kid. The dish was great as long as you're a salami lover. It just brought back great memories as a teenager in North Beach in San Francisco eating a salami sandwich on a hard roll for lunch.  The hash browns were a little over cooked, but hey, they were hash browns. One other thing, the sour dough was actually sliced from a loaf of sour dough bread which came with homemade jam. We will return.

Worked at the office today and for lunch I originally wanted to go to China Inn but it was closed. It was either the Hard Rock or Stoudemire's. Guess you know where I ate.  I ordered yellow squash soup and half a grilled chicken club sandwich for $9 and my coworker order the beer battered fish and chips for $11.  I think they were trolling for the fish and chasing the chicken 'cause almost 25 minutes had gone by before our order was brought to us. The fish looked like chicken drumettes because there was a lot of batter on it; served with waffle fries and a tablespoon of cole slaw. My soup was okay, not hot, good texture but a little bland. My sandwich was okay. The only thing I did not like was the top slice of bread was crisp and the bottom WET!!! .UGH!!! I HATE damp bread!!! Our waitress must have forgotten our order and it must have sat on the counter for who knows how long. It will be sometime before I patronize this restaurant again.

This is a first time to this venue. I've been to the one in Tempe and Chandler.   The interior was nicely decorated which made it look somewhat upscale. We were surprised that when we sat down, the gal asked if we wanted chopsticks and had a nice wooden box containing chopstcks which we chose from.  The server came by and before taking our order wanted to know how we liked our sauce spicy or mild. My wife said spicy and the server mixed it right in front of us. We didn't use the sauce at all.  My wife ordered the Dragon Eye Oolong tea and although she liked it, I didn't. I'm not a fan of flavored HOT tea.  We started with the Ahi Tartare which was like POKE on a chip. It was definitely different and tasted pretty good.  My wife ordered the Kung Po Chicken and I had the LoMein combo. Her chicken dish was loaded with chicken, but were was the vegetables?? I had a pretty good portion of noodles and meat, but where was the vegetables?? The only veggies we saw was sprouts, thinly sliced celery & carrot and scallions.  The portions were good and the flavors were there. Unfortunately, I had to ask for water even though I place my empty glass at the edge of the table. Maybe, they were short of staff that night.

Driving around today we got the munchies. Was looking for Jacquelines Market place, but didn't realize that it was renamed to Cafe Carumba about 5 years ago. I fought with the idea of having breakfast, but since I all ready ate breakfast, I settled on the appetizers.There were four of us so we all ordered appetizers: Tres Hummus Plate, Nachos in a bowl with tri-color chips, chicken quesadilla and chipotle southwest eggroll.  That hit the spot. The Nachos in a Bowl and Southwest Egg rolls were a hit and the quesdilla and hummus plate were okay. The server was slow coming to our patio table, maybe it was because he or someone dropped a tray load of water glasses by the entrance to the patio...JOB OPENING. But, after that, he was very attentive.

When I think of gelato, I automatically think of the Gelato Spot. First spotted them years back on Camelback and I've been a fan ever since. My favorite is the Stracciatella and all others fall into place.  Their free Wi-Fi is always on and is an added touch. Let's you just sit and relax and not head for the door. Keep up the good work.

Before volunteering at St Mary's Food Bank, I used Yelp to find a fast food place and came across Carl's Jr. Read the one review and I was sold.  The worker's there have an infectious, enthusiastic attitude, friendly and want to make your dining experience enjoyable.  I had the Western Bacon Burger which was well worth the $8 for the combo. It included the $6 burger. When is the last time you had the burger bulging out of the bun? The only negative was the shape of the french fries. I like them a lot thinner. If they had shoe string fries, it would be a killer combination. The burger came wrapped like In & Out Burger, not in a cardboard box. The seating area was clean and modem with two color TV's set on the ESPN stations. At one end of the seating area, there was one worker mopping the floor. I've never seen such pride in what they do to keep the place in tip top condition.

I've seen and pass this place a number of times and finally decided to give it a try. When we got there, a Saturday morning,  people waiting inside the restaurant and outside. We were told the wait would be 10-15 minutes.(Really?? Thought it would be longer.)  I believe it may have been 12 minutes. There is a lot of staff cleaning, clearing tables, serving and seating customers. Our server was polite and took our order right away. We started off with orange juice, freshly squeezed, no pulp or seeds but awfully fresh. Their coffee wasn't bad either. The staff kept coming around checking on us, more water? more coffee? How's the food? Anything we can get you? The server wasn't the only person making sure you had and enjoyable meal. It wasn't to long before they brought out our meals. Create your own Omelet: Mushroom, Jack Cheese and bacon. It was the best omelet that I could remember, light, fluffy and generous portions of bacon, mushrooms. The has browns were different, it wasn't shredded, but thinly sliced. My wife had the Swedish pancakes with Lingonberry sauce which is what they serve at Ikea, but this one was 100% better. My wife thoroughly enjoyed her pancakes and told me that this restaurant is a KEEPER.

What a breakfast!! Chorizo and eggs with side of pancakes instead of toast; corned beef hash skillet with sourdough bread. The portions are slightly large which questions your ability to clean your plate. Great value for the price and everything taste so good.   The servers are all attentive and knowledgeable.  The restaurant is going through a make-over in their decor and so far it looks awesome. Do you think that would hamper their service and food quality? NO!  Now that's how to run a successful business.

This Sunday was only a 20 minute wait. As we sat down, one of the staff asked if we wanted coffee...YEAH! It was in the high forties this morning and glad that we didn't have to wait to ask for coffee.  The server was pleasant and asks the right questions. Especially when I asked about the Corn Beef Hash. This time instead of the skillet, I got it on a plate with hash browns, which look like scallop potatoes but was thin and crispy around the edges. My wife enjoys their Swedish Pancakes and my daughter had the Country Benedict. Unfortunately, the egg was over cooked. Other than that, we had a great breakfast and will definitely be back.

It was a cold night and since it was my choice of dining out, I selected this restaurant 'cause we both love Vietnamese food. We started with the spring rolls with shrimp and pork. It took them a while to bring it out. Don't know if they had just made them or what. It hit the spot.  We followed that with Pho...wife  had P2 - Pho Tai, lean sirloing and I had P8 Pho Hai San, seafood which had couple of shrimp, mussels, calamari and scallops. The PHO hit the spot and wife took home the rest of her PHO for her lunch the next day. If this restaurant wasn't so far away, I would frequent it more often.

My wife and I had a craving for Middle Eastern food. I checked on Yelp and found this place where our friends could meet us halfway. They bailed, but we went ahead and enjoyed a delicious meal.  It was a bit strange to be eating in an old 5 and Diner restaurant. None of the ambiance was changed except for the addition of the TV and water pipes lining the wall. We were there for the food. We started off with the Baba Ghannoughe. The pit bread was okay and the Baba Ghannoughe was oily but edible.  My wife ordered a cup of Lintel soup with her Chicken Sharawma sandwich. The soup was excellent and she ordered a bowl to go which looked like a cup instead of a bowl.  Her sandwich was okay...we got spoiled at Sabuddy when it was in Tempe and and then in Scottsdale, their sandwich was in the pocket of the pita bread and not wrapped like a burrito. I ordered the Shish Kafta which was 3 pieces of ground beef and lamb char-broiled with a side of onions & tomato and white rice topped with currant raisins. The meat was cooked just right...firm & flavorful and the rice was okay. It's a good thing I didn't eat lunch 'cause there were good portions on my plate. We topped it off with Baklava...mmmm...so good.

I was in the area on Sunday and was thinking about lunch. When I saw the sign, I decided that this is where I'll have lunch. After stopping off at the Karsten Golf Club,I drove to the take out window. The line was long and it was 1:00 PM. They had a guy outside taking our orders before we go to the window, before you knew it, you were paying, getting your order and driving off. I love their french fries and the hamburgers are always hot off the grill.

After driving around with our Realtor all morning, it was lunch time and she had never been to Sauce. Since we were by there, we stopped in for lunch and split a Cesear salad, my wife, daughter and realtor ordered Pepperoni and Crimini Mushroom pizza and I had the Salami, Turkey, Prosciutto & Mozzarella Panini sandwich. It was excellent, just the right amount of food for lunch.

Was going to another restaurant in Tempe, but because of the UA vs ASU game we changed restaurants.  We've eaten here before, but haven't rated it since I joined YELP.  Katie was our waitress and she must have come from the South because when she checked on my wife,  she always ended her sentence with "Darlin'". Katie mentioned her name twice, had good command of the menu and was very attentive. My wife ordered the White Clam Chowder and crab cakes. The clam chowder could have been hotter; the crab cakes where light and cooked nicely.   I had the Wild Hawaiian Ono which was grilled with sides of baked potato and Roasted Ratatouille which I thought was better than the Garden Vegetables. It had squash, zuchini, tomatos and onions. The fish was okay and a little dry. The baked potato only came with sour cream and chives.

Wife and I stopped off at this restaurant for our date night.  The Last time we were there, I asked Michelle, the general manager, when they would have dungeness crab. She said to drop her an email and she would let us know. In mid April I received an email describing the two crab dishes.  Tonight we both both ordered the steam dungeness crab which comes with 2 sides. Started off by splitting a Cesar Salad. The romaine lettuce was cold and crisp with some type of anchovie  dressing. Yummy, that started off our fabulous meal. The crab comes with crab butter which is very flavorful. You have to crack the legs and separate the meat from the body, but HEY, that's what eating dungeness crab is all about. I would get as much meat in the crab butter before tasting it. Working too slow causes the sides and crab to cool down. My side of asparagus was cooked on the grill and was OK, thought it was slughtly overcooked and the baked potato was the way I liked it.  The meal was very filling, so come with an appetite. Restaurant is always clean and our server was knowledgeable  and attentive. Michelle also advised us that they we be serving Soft Shell crab by the end of the month. We'll be back.

It was my wife's turn to choose a restaurant and since we haven't been here in a while, here we are. We made reservations for 6 PM and when we go there, the place was crowded, but still enough room to hold more customers.  Our server, Charles, was very attentive insuring that my coffee cup was full and everything tasted good. Started our meal with Fried Pickles but I had one pickle slide out of the batter, but all in all it was good. My entree was the Sicilian Pasta and my wife had a chicken dish which I can't remember. My pasta and the french bread was very filling. It was the right size for me and all the ingredients made my dish very tasty. My wife brought the last 1/3 of her chicken home. We ordered 2 cheesecakes to take home, White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut and Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake, but when we ate the cheesecake the next day, my Caramel Macadamia Nut  was substituted with something else. The next time we order to go, we'll make sure we get what we ordered.  We had a wonderful dining experience and will return.

Met our daughter to celebrate my wife's birthday. Coming from FH was about an hour and the traffic was congested but we made it on time, 6 PM on a Friday. As we walked to our table, I noticed that this place was packed.  Our server, Audrey, was right on top of things. She greeted us, asked if this was our first time and told us about the specials. She made us feel like we were invited to her house.  We started off with a small order of alligator which my wife and daughter have never tried. I told them it was like a very tender chicken nugget. They loved it., especially the bed of fried potatoe shavings. I loved the lettuce wedge and it's just as large as the one at Cheesecake Factory. My daughter ordered the Crispy Fried Shrimp. My wife had the Live Maine Lobster and I ordered the Cedar Plank Alaskan Salmon. The shrimp dish had butterflied shrimp with french fries and the main lobster was enjoyed, but I think I would have preferred the Caribbean lobster because the meat would be much firmer. My salmon was cooked just right, it only came with the asparagus which was nice and plump. I brought half of my dinner home. We finished off the dinner with a Key Lime pie which was delicious.  Our server had a keen eye. She automatically assumed that it was a birthday dinner, because she saw my wife reading a birthday card and opening her present from my daughter, and comp'd the desert. Audrey made our evening enjoyable and when we go back, we'll ask for her.

Met some friends for dinner. The employees showed us their southern hospitality, all smiles on their faces with a hearty  "Welcome to Lucille's". Our server April was always checking on us maybe because the place wasn't that busy compared to when it opened. My friends ordered the Lousiana Pasta and full rack of baby back. I ordered the BBQ Two Meat Combo Platter and my wife had the Jambalaya "Me-Oh-My-A".  Either the portions were huge or we weren't hungry....I think it was the later. My friends loved the pasta 'cause he finished it while his wife ate half of her tasty ribs. My wife enjoyed the flavorful Jambalaya and brought half of it home; while I ate half of my 'two meat platter' made of rib tips and baby back ribs. I wish they would have had a 'Rib Tip' dinner 'cause I love chewing on the white buds of cartilage.  Everyone enjoyed their meal and the service was fantastic. As KFC says, "it's finger lickin' good". We'll be back.

It seems every time I head west for either golf or coming back from LA, I like to stop off and grab a number 1. The burger always has fresh produce and the fries are one of the best.

I forgot to finish this...and it's been awhile  My wife tried this place first and didn't care for it, but that was a year or two ago. I've gone by this place so often that I thought I'd give it a try.  The server was polite and knowledgeable. She made sure our drinks were topped off. We started with the Shrimp & Avocado Tempura Roll, Firecracker Chicken with Broccoli, Beijing Duck Noodles and Banana Caramel Spring Roll.   I remember my noodles were a little wet so make sure when you eat them that the juice stays on the noodles and not your shirt.  The dessert was really good.

We meet our friends at this restaurant whose son works as a sous chef. The reservation was under a different name so that we would not get comp for our food. My wife had the huge scallops, four of them cooked to perfection; I had, "what's in this steak!" which came wrapped in mashed potatos and rolled in cheese. Darn IT, they wouldn't reveal how they cooked the steak in the ball of mashed potatoes!! Our friends also ordered scallops and the salmon which was also a big hit!

My wife and I, along with a friend, decided to try this restaurant for our New Year's Eve dinner at 7:00. When we arrived at the hotel, we noticed that this is where Stanford U. was holding their pep rally. Place was buzzing with Red and White and shirts with large printed letter 'S'  or 'STANFORD' . Walking down to the restaurant we were greeted and told it would be a minute. The staff and waiters were very cordial. The place was packed full of people and the noise level was tolerable. We started off with the Waldorf Salad which was AMAZING. The dressing was just the right amount.The acidity in the dressing was just enough to wake up those little taste buds.  After about 20 minutes, the waiter apologized about the service being slow and would comp my wife's wine. We hadn't realize that the time was flying by, 40 minutes had passed and the waiter came over with the dessert menu and said that our whole meal was being comp because they hadn't gotten our main course out to us. He said to go ahead and order dessert and coffee.  When our entrees appeared, my wife had the Roasted Half Chicken which was cooked just right and I had the Herb-Marinated Pork Chop which was cooked medium well. The Apple-Thyme Chutney was sparsely place under the chop, Wishing there was more. The Sweet Potato Mash was wonderful. Our friend had the Filet Mignon which was cooked medium well. He had no problems polishing his plate off. We finished our meals with our Starbucks coffee and apple cobbler which was huge. Even though our meal was comp'd, the food was excellent and we will come back to try it for breakfast or lunch. I just found out by reading another review that if you want bread, you have to ask for it.

We haven't eaten in downtown Mesa in several years.  Forgot to finish this...and it's been some time since we've been. What I had was the filet mignon 'cause I love mushrooms. The filet was cooked the way I like it, medium rare and the demi sauce was excellent.   I will definitely return for another meal.

My wife and I visited this place to grab sandwiches. We were thinking of Quizno's, but saw this place and decided to give it a try.  After I ordered my food; Chicken Gyro, Chicken Kabob and Baba Ghanouj to go, my mind drifted off to "Kitchen Nightmares". I don't know why, but that's what I was thinking. Once our order was ready, we got it and drove home.  The Chicken Gyro had large slices of chicken not bad, but it should have been thinner. Since our "to go" order was in pita bread, it was half soaked with the juices from the tomato and onions. My  kabob was a disappointment, it was also strips of thick dry chicken. I thought it was the GYRO and expected chunks of chicken. It was difficult to eat, so I ended up eating just the chicken.  Now, the Baba Ghanouj was disgusting. The mixture was "slop" immersed in olive oil. One bite was all  we could stand. The best I ever had was at "Sabuddy" Israeli restaurant which closed because the owner returned to New York.  As for the sandwiches,  the pita bread was excellent and the next time I will have it there and NOT "To Go".

This restaurant had the same concept as "DISH" at the same location. We decided to patronize this restaurant. Was seated and waited and waited to be acknowledged by the waiter. They were all huddled at the end of the bar chit chatting. After 10 minutes I gave up and walked out because there were couples that came in after us that were approached by a waiter. Told the manager what had happened and his only reply..."I'm sorry but try us again." Would I try this restaurant again? Not in the near future.

We tried this restaurant, again, this past Sunday and the service was much better than the last, but there were only a family of four, a couple and an individual diner. My wife and daughter had the 2 for $20; salad, pizza and wine. I tried the Salmon and Scallop Osso Buco. All our entries were brought out at the same time. The osso buco was wonderful, scallops cooked just perfectly and with the right amount of sauce. With the specials going on this summer, it's not a bad place to drop a few dollars.

This restaurant used to be called La Piazza. It now serves mostly appetizers and pizza, but also has pasta specials. Be sure to ask your server. Even tho' the service was less than desirable. Our server was knowledgeable, but had to work on getting information out of her. She was slow in getting us water and refills. BTW, I was charged for my soda refill and we had to ask the bus boy for the water. We started off with the Caprese salad which was large enough to split. My wife had the Margherita pizza, but the server forgot to bring the extra plates and red peppers. My order was, clams with linguine ... it seems our server forgot my order, which finally came 10-15 minutes after the pizza. It was well worth the wait, it was just the right portion, hot and lots of clams. I'll go back to this remarkable restaurant, But the next time I will find another server.

Before heading off to the iPIC theater, we decided to have dinner there because it was 6 PM on a Saturday and it was busy, but we were able to get a table for 4.  The place reminds you have Cheesecake Factory or Cafe Lux, but the prices are a tad bit higher. From the time we sat down to the time we left, it was a great dining experience. The waiter made us feel at home. he made sure our water glasses were full.  As for the food, my wife had the crab and shrimp cakes and said it was the BEST she has EVER had.  I had the Grilled Shrimp with Orzo which was excellent. Presentation was beautiful and the dish had lots of flavor with the right amount of heat. Our friends shared the Grilled Salmon dish which was wonderful.  The manager stopped by to see how everything was and chatted with us for a few minutes. When we departed at 7:15 PM, there was a crowd at the door waiting for tables. I definitely will be back.

We actually wanted to eat at Martinelli's but is was like a haunted house. No lights on...so we chose Thai Cuisine instead.  When we go there around 6 PM on a Wednesday, theater night, "Cirque Illuminations" and was asked if we had reservations. We told them no and she said it would be awhile...had to ask what 'awhile' was and she replied 30-45 minutes. The place was packed and since there weren't that many restaurants around this location, we decided to wait. There are only two servers for 40+ patrons.  We were seated at 6:40 PM...and we all ready decided on the dishes:  Pork Spicy Basil (Pad Gra-Prow) and Shrimp Pad See-Ew.   We started with a house salad which was okay with a dressing that was very tasty. The service was very slow and when we received our food, it was 7:00 PM.  Twenty minutes to eat, pay the bill and get a to go box.   My wifes dish,  Pork Spicy Basil, was very flavorful and both of us enjoyed that more than my  Shrimp Pad See-Ew. The menu for this item stated Chinese broccoli...of which I saw about 1%, the rest being American broccoli.  I brought my noodles home to eat the next day...it was yummy. I will be visiting this place again, but this time, I'll call ahead to make a reservation.

My wife loves this place as well as myself. Tonight, before heading to the MAC, we made early reservations because this place is quite busy and the service is slow.  We got there at 5:45 and the place was 1/3 full.   We sat down and my wife ordered the Spicy Basil with Beef and I ordered the Crab Fried Rice...then I decided to order the deep fried Chicken Wings.   I couldn't believe how fast the food flew out of the kitchen. Maybe it's because the restaurant wasn't that busy. Our waitress had a thick accent or it could be that I'm losing my hearing, but she was difficult to understand and she didn't know the menu. Had to tell her the number on the item.  Our favorite was the Spicy Basil which was full of flavor. The chicken wing was supposed to be dipped in spicy sweet sauce, but it was drenched in the sauce which was okay for us. The fried rice was uneventful. The crab was shredded in the rice and you could hardly taste it. I thought it would be chunks of crab. For $13, I'd try something else.  All in all...food is awesome and we will definitely return to try something different.

We planned ahead to have dinner here and made reservations the for 6:15 PM before going to the 7:30 PM showing of Dreamgirls at the MAC.  Arrived around 6:20 and was seated immediately. The place was crowded and the service seemed to be a bit slow. We all ready knew what we wanted so we ordered our meal at 6:30 PM.   My wife and I sat and conversed over hot Jasmine tea. Some time had past and the server came to our table and told us that it would be another 10 minutes before our order would be ready and do we want to wait. I looked at the time and it was 7:10. I told him 'NO, void our ticket. So, we got up and left for the theatre.   If they were on Top Chef, I would have told them to 'pack your knives and LEAVE'. The food is excellent there, but if you can't produce in a timely manner, then WHY even open.  I think their problem is that they possible have one chef and when the restaurant is crowded, there is NO WAY they can keep the patrons HAPPY. There was a another table with two ladies and they were able to eat just the appetizer.  I hope the owners of the restaurant are reading these comments from YELP because they have to open their eyes to see they are above the heads and NEED to hire another CHEF in the kitchen.  If there was an option of ZERO stars, that's what I would have rated them.

We went there two weeks ago with another couple.  My wife ordered the sliced brisket;  I had the tri tip and sausage; Gordon ordered the stuff potato and his wife had a combo  plate  and we all had sides of cole slaw and sweet potato fries.  All the meat that we ordered was not hot off the grill. It was dry and came with the sauce which was also cold. The cole slaw was the way I like it, but the sweet potato fries were limp which to me indicated that it was cooked ahead of all the other foods.  The waitress was friendly and attentive. We finished off our meal by sharing an apple cobbler. To our surprise, our friends paid for our dinners. "WHEW".

Did our Christmas Angel that day and stopped off to grab some quick food.   I like In-N-Out no matter where it's located. My only issue with this one is with the french fries. They must have been sitting in the tray waiting to be matched up with a burger order because  ours were limp.  Maybe I should order their twice cooked fries.

The place was packed and the only available spot was at the counter.  My wife and I had the Famous Soulfood platter which comes with cornbread. My two sides was the Mac & Cheese and waffle; my wife on the otherhand had Mac & Cheese with Collard greens.  The employees were all very helpful and attentive even though the place crowded. The lemonade was served in quart size Mason jars and was really sweet. Maybe they forgot to stir the sugar when it was added. Just have to wait for the ice to melt.  When we got our order the Mac & Cheese was overcooked and the waffle was okay 'cause I like mind crispy. A couple of minutes more would have been perfect. My wife loved the Collard greens and the Southern Fried Chicken was out of this world. The breast I had was huge. I managed to eat most of the Mac and Cheese, waffle and cornbread. It was a LOT of food.  I'm going to try this place again during the week when the place is much calmer, if it ever is.

We've eaten here a long time ago and forgot how good the food was. We decided to eat outside since it was a beautiful afternoon and the sun was just coming down. All of the seats that were situated in the shade were taken but loving the sun we sat at a table near some palm trees. The trunk provided some relief, but lets get back to the food. We started off with a large half regular & Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus. The pita bread was much larger than I have seen and was enough to finish scraping the plate. My wife ordered the Roasted Garlic and Portabello pizza and I had the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (shawarma). The pizza was thin and crispy which was really something delicious along with the roasted garlic and mushrooms on top.  My Shawarma was a handful. You needed both hands to hold this as you deiivered this wonderful morsel to your bite down on. I didn't think I could finish it.  Our server was wonderful and kept on checking on us and filling our water glasses. The outdoor area was clean and inviting. We were able to find parking in the 1 hour slots around 5:30 PM.  We'll definitely return.

What a great place for Asian food. My wife and I like this place because it much closer than other Asian supermarkets. I mainly go there to buy ingredients to make my lunch at home. Dried noodles, sliced beef and pork, mustard greens, gai lan, baby bok choy and anything else that catches my eye. Much cheaper and way more variety than Safeway, our last resort. This past weekend, parking was horrific. There was an amusement park set up in half of the parking spaces. The was live Asian entertainment with rides for the children.  We didn't stay long 'cause of Superbowl Sunday.

We had some friends stop by and we decided to try this place since the middle eastern restaurant I wanted to try became Italian.  We ordered the Spring Rolls, Char-broiled Chicken, Spicy Beef Basil and Chicken Chow Mein. All of it was very tasty, but  the mild sauce was a little weak. Next time we'll try medium.  We only had water to drink and for 4 hungry people, with the tip, the cost was a little over $40. Such a deal for really flavorful meals.  We've been to several Thai Places in the valley and this one is on top of our list for several reasons. It's affordable, delicious and within driving distance.

My wife just loves this place for breakfast. We decided to try it out for dinner. The roasted duck was a bit on the dry side. Had the sauce on the side which wasn't enough to finish my meal and the vegetables was cooked perfectly. My wife's crab cakes were okay and the sweet potato fries were waffle cut and excellent .  Our waitress was extremely friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. Even the owner stopped by and chatted with us. All in all we thought the meal was a bit pricey, but would definitely be back for breakfast.

Believe it or not, I'm not crazy about Mexican food. I think it started 30 years ago on my trip to Puerto Vallarta...ended my week there having Montezuma's revenge. I know it's not the food, but it didn't help.  Celebrated my daughter's birthday there and she ordered the Chicken Fundido, my wife had the Mexicano and I had the tequila lime shrimp. The food was piping hot...I mean, when you took a bite, you had to swirl it in your mouth to cool it. The food was excellent. If you plan on dining there, call a couple of days in advance to make a reservation. Even though it's been open several months, on a week day, there are still patrons waiting 40-45 minutes for a table.

The venue had outdoor seating, but it was CHILLY that evening and we had a table by the fire place, but I still felt a draft from the front door. Our server was knowledgeable and polite. We started off with the EMPANADAS de CHORIZO con PAPA which was fresh and tasty. I thought about taking pictures of the food, but thought otherwise. My wife had the Prickly Pear  Margarita which looked really refreshing. I'm a 'wuss' when it comes to alcoholic drinks, turning all different shades of red especially my eyes. We split the CHIPOTLE BBQ  ENSALADA which was a little heavy on the dressing, but was still delicious.  Our main course consisted of ENCHILADAS de MARISCOS and CAMARONES al TEQUILA. The Enchilada has good serving of shrimp and crab and the Camarones were cooked perfectly. Good thing I didn't have lunch.  We ended the meal with coffee and Cinnamon Churros. It was a great dining experience and will return to try more of their menu items.

I love Carls Jr, but the hamburger was put together sloppy. When did they start using square buns?? And to top it off it was stale. Brought it back and got a round  bun, but that didn't help the experience. Just couldn't eat any more and dumped my meal in the trash.  The soda fountain was running out of several sodas. They looked like were short handed, but there was an elderly employee taking her break in the eating area.  This place was much better than before, but it has gone the tubes. Scratch this location off my list. Adios!!

Happened to be in the neighborhood and since we had a coupon for a free appetizer we decided to stop and have an early dinner. There was plenty of parking We got there early, 5 PM, was seated in the back, only a couple of tables from the server's station.. The food was good and hot which is pretty consistent with all the other Chili Restaurants. Server was attentive. My wife had the Southwestern Eggrolls for her dinner and I had the classic Bacon Burger.  Everything was good as usual. When we left, the place was filling up for a Thursday.

We stopped off for lunch and had the California Burger and my wife had the build your own burger. The waitress came over to our table and didn't introduce herself, just asked us what we wanted to drink. That out of the way, I noticed that all their hamburgers are 1/2 lb. Pretty good size. When we got our order, it was served on an oval plate with lots of sweet potato fries....YUM!! The bun was fresh and the hamburger cooked just right. My wife could only finish half and when I was done, I was stuffed. I probably could have gone without dinner that night. For two burgers and two lemonades, our bill came to $29.16. Not  a place you drop by that often...but when you do, it's well worth it.

Best buffet in the Valley!! They give you the right portion so you don't have any leftovers in your plate. Were else can you find a buffet that serves, Kobe Beef and Lamb Chops, which are freshly cooked. They were excellent. Even the Gelato was delicious, but I wish they had more flavors.  Downside was the oysters which were dry from sitting too long and the macaroons were burnt.  We ate dinner there several times and enjoyed the atmosphere and service. We will be back to try their breakfast and lunch.

Who would have thought Cajun food in a Casino. I thought Baby Kay's was great, but hands down this is by far my favorite place. The place was crowded with convention and spring training visitors. We had to wait about 30 minutes which is well worth the wait.  The way the food is cooked, using steam, keeps your entree hot till the very end. The flavors are very consistent and the amount of seafood used is generous. Our friends had the Oysters on the half shell and is the best I've had in a long time. I had the Pan Roast with crab meat and dirty rice. My wife had the Crawfish Etouffee combo with Dirty rice. On a scale of 1 - 10 for hotness we had a 6 which turned out to be a little too hot for us. Our entrees were great. Kudos to the Asian lady chef who prepared our meals. Great job!!

We love this restaurant/bar. If we lived closer we would patronize it more often. This time we had the Pan Roast Combo and Pan Roast Crab. My heat index was 2 which wasn't bad at all. They were pretty generous with all the different types of seafood. My wife loved the Pan Roast Crab. She really enjoyed the flavors. We topped off our meal with Blood Orange Gelato. Well, it's not quite the creamy version of gelato, more like shaved ice. But, it was refreshing. The cook gave my wife a Christmas ornament made from used menus, what a great gift.

Since we were down in Chandler, we decided to try to find a sushi restaurant. Looked at YELP and found this restaurant which was a couple of miles away and located on the way home. When we first walked in, there was this musty odor that slowed my pace into the restaurant. My wife said it's coming from the carpet. When we sat down, the server came over and took our order. I told him I wanted Chirashi and he gave me a quizzical look. So, I had to point to the item in the menu. My wife  ordered a couple of sushi rolls. He brought us two bowls of miso soup which was okay. It took a while for the entrées to come out 'cause there is only one sushi chef. When the food came out, I noticed that the raw fish was not cut in the traditional way. It was like strips of French fries, but the fish was fresh and the Chirashi was pleasantly different with a wide variety of ingredients. The one thing I didn't like was the fact that they didn't pickup the soup bowls and we had to ask for plates to put our sushi on. However, for a Japanese restaurant, the price is very reasonable.  They also offered sliced oranges at the end of the meal.

You have to order their fried pickles for an appetizer. They came out piping HOT and really good. I had the lettuce wedge appetizer which was just the item to start my dinner. I ordered the mushroom burger, my wife had the knife and fork burger and my daughter had the BLT burger. I thought for sure my bun was soaked in the juices from the burger, but behold, it was dry and light. The tater tots was awesome, haven't had them since my kids were little. To finish the meal off, we ordered the S'MORES. What an eye catching sight when they brought out hot charcoal in a square ceramic style pot, flame dancing on the charcoal, marshmallows, graham crackers and Hershey chocolate. We were acting like kids in a candy store making our S'MORES.

Since I retired and most of my colleagues work from home, we try and meet once a month at different restaurants. This month we decided to try this restaurant 'cause it central to the valley. I had their Chicken Souvlaki which was delicious. The chicken was cut in large cubes and oh so tender. I've eaten there before when I worked downtown and haven't been disappointed.

This restaurant gives you a lot of food for the price. We ordered the mushi pork, pan fried noodles and mixed vegetables with black mushrooms. The mushi pork was great  but the pan fried noodles were overwhelmed with the sauce. The mixed vegetables was okay I should have ordered my favorite, Chinese broccoli. We brought half of the food home except for the mushi pork that we devoured. One thing I really disliked was the plastic chopsticks. It was a test to see how much food you could get to your mouth before the food would slide off the chopstick.

My daughter ordered our sandwiches ahead of time. The place was packed around 12:30 PM. So difficult to get to the soda machine which is located where you pick up your sandwiches. Other than that, I loved the french bread and everything in it was fresh. I ordered the Vito sandwich which had Genoa salami, provolone, capicola, onion, lettuce and tomato topped with an Italian vinaigrette which I barely tasted. There own chips are like the Maui chips thick and crunchy. I'll be back to try something different.

The sangria is the best. If you're looking for TAPAS, you've come to the right place. The food is unique and wonderful. Tried their Shrimp Taco, YUMMY. The brushetta, 4 for $12, was delicious and filling. Also the Tomales were great. Seems that all the vegetables they use are fresh. I tried their salad which came in a small bowl which looked like it wasn't enough until you start digging down and eating.  Service was excellent and polite. Which I had enough room for the coconut flan. I'll order it the next time.

We went there for dinner because our daughter told us about it. It is a long walk from the tram to the restaurant on the 2nd floor. I headed down to get sushi and fried shrimp with it's head, legs and tail still attached...it was YUMMY. As for the sushi, it was okay, but where are the chopsticks???  My next helping was crab which had thin legs but was all ready sliced. It was tender and moist. I thought for sure it was going to be dry. Tried the watermelon gazpacho which was really good and the general chow's chicken was excellent. I really didn't like the corn succotash...not the flavor I like. If you're looking for desserts. don't get the ones that are under the lights 'cause it will definitely be dry...cookies and cake. The coffee was bold and full of flavor. There was a sign at the entrance that said $35 Sunday through Thursday. So, I asked what the prices for dinner on Friday and Saturday and it was the same price.

We stopped off for dinner to find the restaurant busy. There were at least  4 groups totaling 12 people and 1 waitress and 1 sushi chef.   It seems each time we go there, there is a different server. She just didn't know the menu or how to check on her customers. Several times, the chef had to come over and wait on his patrons. He actually took our order.  We were served green salad with too much dressing for the amount of salad we had. The soup was luke warm. Our sever disappeared for a while. Good thing the Olympics was on to help pass the time.  My wife ordered the Tempura dinner and a dragon roll and I had the Chirashi with Seaweed salad. The Tempura was quite good but the problem was that it was brought out first and by the time I received my food, she had finished hers.  Some of my fish in my Chirashi was butchered and sushi rice was not soft and fluffy. The Dragon roll was good, but could have been much larger. Most sushi houses give you a nice FAT roll.

Hold onto your ear muffs...this place was rockin'. Could hardly hear yourself think. Since we came late, we sat at the tall tables near the bar. Colin our waiter was friendly and made you feel at home. With five flat screen TV's spread along the bar, we watched the Cowboys sink the Bucs.  We could hear the people in the other dining area. Seems everyone was having a great time there. I didn't see a dance floor 'cause I was expecting to see couples 'two stepping' or line dancing.  I ordered a full rack of ribs and my wife had the broaster chicken. The meat from the ribs fell right off the bone. My two sides were mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables which were pretty good. The broaster chicken was tasty and juicy. I couldn't believe I ate the whole rack of  ribs along with a piece of chicken.   One thing that was disturbing was that the owner DID NOT stop by our table to say Hello, but he did stop by the tables on our right and left. I guess if your not a regular there, you don't deserve a greeting and you are ignored. Shame on him. But this restaurant still deserves 4 stars.  Even though its loud there, I'll be back to this place for some of their tasty grub. BTW, just a note, my ATT phone only had 1 bar and I couldn't check in at Yelp.

My wife enjoyed her meal, but I'm pretty picky when I experience the same style of food that I've had before, YC's in particular. After being seated, we grabbed our bowls and headed towards the food line. There were three rows of food and condiments. The third row was a little difficult to get to. None of the employees were paying attention to the food. You could see where people had gotten something and it spilled onto the edge of another container of food. The setup was totally inefficient. The selections were so-so. I was surprised that we could only order our noodles or rice at the end. For noodles, they used soba noodles which are a lot thicker than YC's and THEY control the portion. WHERE's THE NOODLES!! And that is one reason out of several, why I won't be back.

We enjoyed this same restaurant in Mesa and just noticed that they had opened one in Scottsdale.   The place was packed and arriving at 6:00 PM we were able to be seated immediately. Ten or fifteen minutes later, we would have been waiting. Our waitress was friendly. You could see the manager walking around seeing that everything was going okay, but I don't think she ever visited a table to see how her patrons were doing.  My wife had the Margherita Pizza and a salad and I had the Linguini Pescatore.   The pizza was good along with her garden salad. My linguini was fabulous. The mussels were like muscles. I had a choice of Red or White sauce, so I chose Red. When I was finished, I used the bread to wipe my bowl clean. It was so good.

I wish I had more of an appetite. We ordered the Applelicious Pancakes, Eggs Jared and Lemon ricotta pancakes. They were all delicious. The pancakes were huge and almost overflowing the plate. My daughter loved her Eggs Jared and we enjoyed our pancakes.  On a Saturday morning around 9:30, the place wasn't packed, but by the time we left, there was a large crowd forming.One coupe had brought their dog and sat on the patio.  The restaurant was clean and decorated nicely. Our server was helpful. We'll be back to enjoy some of the other interesting concoctions.

This was our first and last time. Why is there an entry charge of $12/person??? We got our tickets on Groupon for $6/person. And why would we pay $2 for an ExtraHand cardboard box. You can't even SAMPLE other food trucks, it's just too darn expensive. We picked two FoodTrucks, cost $30. Add that to the entry fee and you can go to a sit down restaurant with no waiting line and clean bathrooms.

This place was packed on Sunday @ 10:00 am. By 11:00 there was ample seating. Had their omelet with ham and added mushrooms.  Once it arrived, my omelet had lots of ham and mushrooms along with my favorite, hash browns. My wife had their single short stack which the single pancake covered the whole plate with a side of bacon.  The staff was friendly but the order took some time to get to our table.

I switched with them thinking I could save some money by bundling my package and get the same type of service I had before. NOT!! The internet service is a joke. Maybe its because I live in Fountain Hills. They shouldn't even offer the service here.

We didn't have time to make breakfast this morning and since Paradise Bakery was gone from the concourse, we decided we'd get our breakfast burrito to go. We began eating our burritos in the waiting area. My wife started eating hers and after 10 minutes, I started on mine.  First. My burrito started falling apart before I could get a bite out of it. Ended up eating it with a fork, secondly, the other half started falling apart when I tried to pick it up. When I lifted the burrito, the underside of the burrito was soggy and dripping wet from the salsa. My wife's wasn't like that and for that reason, this place deserves just a half of one star.  4/17/2014 I changed this from 1 star to 2 stars because I was a bit harsh. It was just a poor execution that drove me crazy. The flavors were there which was hidden by the way the burrito was wrapped.

It's always between Habit or Smashburger. Took my wife and daughter who both ordered the Avocado Burger and I ordered the Truffle mushroom burger.  You can't order three burgers, two sweet potato fries, one French fries and three Fountain drinks. You have to order one at a time, burger, Fries and drInk. My French fries were cooked just right, not limp, they weren't cooked ahead of time. The bottom of my bun was DRY, instead of soggy even though my burger was juicy. But, where was the mushrooms. Take a look at my picture. One think though, I had to notify an employee to check the Men's restroom. I'll leave it at that. Will I be back, definitely. .

Hear about a new chinese restaurant in town. There is ample parking and the employees are friendly which was 'way' different from some of the Chinese restaurants that I have visited.  We ordered Won ton Soup, Pan Fried noodles with chicken and Szechwan Pork.  The soup is actually for 1 individual, but we shared it and it was just the perfect amount to get those gastronomical juices flowing. The Won Ton in the soup had that unique flavor that you find in original won tons. All the ingredients were FRESH! In the Szechwan Pork dish, I thought they had too much bell peppers. We usually order our dishes without the bell pepper but forgot this time. We will definitely be back for either the take-out or dine-in menu.

I love noodles and to my dismay, the lo mein was like one reviewer stated, 'spaghetti disguised as lo-mein' tasting pretty bland. The Orange Chicken was over done and the Broccoli Chicken must have been sitting in the hot lights for a couple of days.   Sorry, I won't be back.

Another hamburger place has opened where Baja Fresh used to be.  For a Thursday night, there were a few patrons. The prices are OK and you can custom make your own char burger. But if you look at the burger, it's only about a 1/4 inch thick. My wife was smarter and ordered the double char burger which she custom built. I ordered the Bacon Char burger. We ordered both the regular and sweet potato fries which where a bit salty. We both enjoyed our burgers.  This place reminded me of Quizno which had the three different peppers that you could add to your meal at the condiment station. The staff was friendly and of course the place was clean.

The staff is very friendly and insuring that you have a great experience. My wife ordered the Santa Barbara and I had the Mushroom Char. Both orders with small drink and FF, under $20. The hamburgers were not greasy and the bun wasn't soaked in the juices. Everything was fresh and FF were piping hot.  The staff is always cleaning the dining area and asking if there is anything else we wanted.

My daughter told us about this coffee shop. So we stopped off to see what it's all about. You can only order your coffee when you get to the window. (subtract 1 star). The car in front of us had several gals in the car and the cashier, a guy, was chatting away for at least ten minutes and a few minutes after giving them their coffee. (Minus 1 star).  We gave our order and I told him this was the first time we have tried their coffee, so he gave me a card with 9 stamps on it.   I tried their Annihilator and at first it tasted good, then it was watered down. My wife's coffee was so-so. (Minus another star). I think we are going to stick with Starbucks for their flavored coffee. The next time I visit Dutch Bros it'll be to try their regular coffee.

We've been here several times after my last comment.  I tried the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap which was surprisingly fried. But I have to admit that is was very delicious which came with a salad. Ate half and had the other half the following day. My wife had the Chipotle Chicken Pizza which was huge. She was only able to eat half.  Our server was polite and kept an eye on our table.

Saw this restaurant on Channel 8, 'Check, Please'. We both love dungeness crab, so here we are. We selected a 2+ pounds if crab at $18/pound, with the mild cajun boil. I also ordered corn, save your money, not worth it. Ordered the cole slaw which was pretty decent.  Make sure if you're eating from a boil bag to ask for plastic gloves which fit us loosely. Bring your own gloves for a better fit. Once you have your gloves on, open the boil bag and start tearing the bag open and you better know who to crack a whole crab because it's up to you.  The crab tasted great and had delicious flavors. The only problem was the crab didn't fill us up. We ordered the Soft Shell Crab Sandwich. Everything tasted great except the bun. It was just a piece of dry bread with no dressing or condiments.  We'll be back to try something different like the Shrimp Boil. .

Now I know why this place is packed and even on a Wednesday. This place is huge. The server was very pleasant and attentive. I had the Bison Burger with a fried egg and my wife had the Walleye fish and chips.  The fish and chips was amazing. I've heard a lot about this fish and it works just as good as the Cod. The fish was huge, take a look at my picture of it. My hamburger came on a beautiful bun.  When I picked it up to take a bite, the egg exploded and the bun kept sliding off the meat. It was a bit messy. The French fries were cooked perfectly, nice crunch and not limp like other restaurants.  We also had the Wide Mouth Blonde Alert which was very good. Don't forget happy hour from 3-7, Mon-Fri. A good time to try their own Beef Jerky which is a little spicy. We will definitely return.

No, this is not near Wild Horse Pass, this restaurant is located at the Talking Stick Golf course in Scottsdale. Happy Hour is from 11- 2 or 3 PM.  After a round of golf, our group decided to have lunch and to our surprise, the servings were a plate full. I had the Club, my friends had the Sliders, Chicken Wrap and last, a burger. The server made sure we had enough water and beer. All the entrees come with one side and I opted for the Home Chips and the others, french fries. For the value, the Chicken Wrap during happy hour was $5 which large enough for me to enjoy compared to my Club.  Everyone was happy and we left stuffed.

Great place for breakfast. Had to wait 30 minutes on a Sunday morning. Ordered the Corned Beef Hash. Thought it would be separated, but it was mixed together. Still tasted good.
