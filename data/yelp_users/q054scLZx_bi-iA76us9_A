Simply asked to revise my order of fries and both manager and cashier in the drive thru both glared at me as if I was twisting their arm and ruining their day.  Which in turn caused me pull away, leaving the gift card I was going to pay with because I will not be returning this McDonald's.

No offense to the taste of my delicious sandwich but the man that took my order that went by the name of "George" really needs to work on his attitude while taking over the phone orders. If he is the only person qualified to take orders, this location is lacking in proper personnel and needs to take corrective action immediately if they desire to keep me as a customer.

I come here every Tuesday and it never fails to please me. All I can suggest is that they rearrange the patio so the smokers have more room, further away from the non smokers so everyone can enjoy their dining to the full extent!

Best wings on mill. 100x better than hooters in my opinion and the atmosphere during any sporting even is unmatched. Great grill, even better bar.
