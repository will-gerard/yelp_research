Really can't go wrong at just about any Cheesecake Factory but this one is exceptionally reliable. We frequent this location once or twice a month and almost always have perfect service and great food.

If I could offer this place negative 10 stars, I would. My partner and I made the unfortunate mistake, more than once, of staying and NY NY. The first time was with my parents. They had our reservation completely wrong! They checked us into 2 smoking rooms with no strip view. Both my mother and I have health problems when it comes to smoke but that is not even the point! We booked 2 special packages, offered directly on NY NY's official website, that included strip view rooms that were NON smoking. I verified this with the clerk at check in and he rudely told us they were indeed nonsmoking. NY NY did move us to 2 rooms that were nonsmoking but they were on separate floors. That is not what we arranged when we booked our reservations. I completed an online survey about our stay later on and they actually offered us 2 nights free if we came back. My partner and I returned alone a couple of months later and it was an "OK" stay. During our second "free" stay we experienced HORRIBLE service at more than on of NY NY's food establishments. Many reviewers point out that NY NY's food options are not great.  We chose to return a 3rd time because of NY NY's location and price several months later. This 3rd trip was THE WORST of all 4 stays. While we were there one of there house keeping staff walked into our room WITHOUT knocking. He was clearly in a hurry and and ran in to drop off pillows. We were not even up on a our feet before he was standing in the middle of our room. We jumped the moment we hear him coming in but he was going way too fast. When I reported this the manager on duty was completely rude. He actually tried to blame the situation on us! I later reported his conduct and was assured his manager would be contacting me. I waited one week to hear from them and then emailed them myself and competed their email survey, very honestly. Still nothing! POOR follow up! After I emailed the original contact from our first issue moths earlier, they offered us another 2 night stay and my partner and I sad "this is THE last shot." The general manager assured me that he would be at the front desk to greet us when we arrived and that our stay would be flawless. When we arrived, our reservations was completely wrong! After paying for flights and taking time off from work we arrive to find out that we would have a view of the parking garage and that our free stay was NOT free! They told us we would have to pay a resort fee! Unbelievable!!! After quite a long period of time at the front desk and meeting with yet another manager, the general manager emerged from some special place in their back office. He actually argued with me about the fee! Finally it was waived when I caused quite the scene in front of other customers. I will not stay at NY NY again and highly recommend you stay elsewhere if you wish to have privacy. Some will say we should have locked our door but we just stopped back into our room for 5-10 minutes to use the bathroom and then hit the strip again.   If you value your hard earned money and wish to have a fun relaxing vacation where staff members are well mannered and trained to provide you quality service, DO NOT STAY AT NY NY. Try another hotel down the strip.   Note: All of our troubles occurred between 9/09 and 5/10

My partner and I went to Rum Jungle on last weekend while we were in Vegas and it was amazing!  This was his first time he had been and it was my 4th visit.  I have been 3 times now with friends/family and I planned a company dinner their last June.  The service is always above and beyond, and the food is like no other.  Their servers always have answers to your questions about the food and their recommendation for drinks are right on.  The music at night, when it changes to bar/club, is also great!  I honestly do not have a bad thing to say about Rum Jungle and will certainly return when I am in town.

I eat at Delux at least once a month.  Most of the time we order to go but the atmosphere is great and the burgers are unique and very satisfying.  They have a secret sauce that is good on just about anything!  If you go make sure you get some of their sweet potato fries and I suggest the Delux Burger.  They do not have a huge amount of seating and it does get busy so try to get there earlier before 7:00-7:30.

I recently moved away from Phoenix and can easily say Delux is 1 of the top 5 things I miss about that city. We ordered from Delux 2 go at least 3 or 4 times a month. The service was always consistent and we rarely ran into issues with our order. You can get just about anything off of the regular Delux menu to go. I do agree with others that the sweet potato fries can be soggy. We usually avoided soggy fries by telling our order taker that we had issues with soggy fries in the past and wanted to prevent that from happening again. The Delux burger is THE best twist on the conventional burger I have ever experienced and is best when prepared medium rare.   The sweet potato fries are a must with any meal and you always have to ask for extra secret Delux sauce. That stuff is good on ANYTHING!

Flawless service!  I drive past 3 or 4 other dry cleaners to go here.  I have never had a problem and their prices are reasonable.

I can always rely on this Chipotle location for consistent service.  Friendly staff and the long line moves fast.
