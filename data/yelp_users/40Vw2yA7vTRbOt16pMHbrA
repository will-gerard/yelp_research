Horrible not because of the food but because of the lack of integrity in the employees and not taking ownership for a system that advertised 20% by ordering online but then did not honor the discount.   Neither of the employees could explain how to get the 20% of off either. I then showed him on the Web where I ordered it from my phone and there was no coupon button as he suggested.  Very disappointed as I really wanted to like this place but I will take integrity over quality anytime.

Took family there for a late Mothers Day Dinner for mom and Aunt as well as a Birthday the Uncle... Everyone loved their meals, the place was not busy at all for a Friday night but we did not get there until 8PM so the service was really amazing.  The lobster was very tender and tasty which is what mom and I had.  As other reviewers mentioned, the veggies were a little watery, but not overcooked and certainly still enjoyable.  A better veggie choice or just crisper freshly made veggies and I would have given it 5 stars for a Seafood restaurant in the desert.  I also hate chains so this was a good find for us.
