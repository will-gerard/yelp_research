We ate here this Saturday night, August 31 using a DealChicken voucher that we had purchased for $99.  The voucher was for a 4-course menu of endless fondue, including a cheese fondue to start, 4 sales, an endless fondue entree, chocolate fondue for dessert, plus a bottle of wine. This was supposedly a $200 retail value. In addition, a 20% gratuity, placed on the full value of the meal, before tax, was to be added.  While the service was fine, and I really don't have too many complaints regarding the food, this was the first time I've ever been mislead by a restaurant when purchasing a voucher. The actual retail value, according to their menu, was $168.80, not $200. This included 4 endless fondue entrees at $36.95 each, plus a $21 bottle of wine.  While I understand that restaurants take a fraction of their regular margins when accepting a voucher from DealChicken, Groupon, Living Social, etc., it's a marketing decision they have decided to make to hopefully attract new customers. I was very disappointed to find out that this Melton Pot location had inflated their base prices before selling the voucher, and included a mandatory gratuity based on that same inflated value.  While I have no issue tipping 20% for great service, I prefer to tip on the actual value of the meal... not an overstated number.  While the food was okay, I can't in good heart return to a restaurant that nickels and dimes its customers. This was very disappointing and I expected better from a national chain.

A great favorite of ours. Service is constantly friendly. Food is of excellent quality and portions are huge. They also accept Restaurant.com gift certificates. I highly recommend Golden Gate Chinese Restaurant. After moving from NYC two years ago, this has become our favorite Chinese restaurant in the Phoenix market!

Very rarely will I write a review, but tonight's experience at Zipp's leaves me no choice.  Our waitress, Lacey P, had an attitude from the moment we arrived. I'm not sure what was bugging her, but it was certainly nothing that our party of three did.  Midway through our meal, as she was clearing plates off the table, she accidentally dropped a carrot slice from somebody's salad into my beer. That's no big deal. Staff has accidents all the time. The issue just begins here though. Lacey P didn't apologize or acknowledge me. She simply took my half finished beer, and after five minutes, returned with a new beer in a smaller cup. She explained that I received the smaller cup because the beer she had ruined was not a full beer.  I'm not going to fight with a waitress, however if you make a mistake, you need to correct it properly. A simple apology would have been fine and no new beer would have been necessary.  The night was fine again until it was time for Lacey P to remove the rest of our plates. At which time, she flung a knife across the table, assuming it would land in our wing basket. However, said knife did not land in said wing basket. It landed about 4 inches from my leg.  I find this behavior dangerous above all. I can't, in good conscience return to Zipp's ever again. I can get over poor service, but I absolutely can't get over such blatant disregard for safety.  Lacey P, if you're having a bad day, don't come into work. It's that simple. No need to endanger Zipp's customers.  What a terrible, terrible experience.

As a new Arizona transplant from Manhattan, my wife and I have only been in this area for 8 weeks, I think I know a thing or two about pizza.  While not quite Manhattan quality, Gus's is certainly close.  We placed our order online and it was delivered within minutes of when it said it would be.  While the pizza was a tad on the cool side, the pie had the look and feel of real NYC pizza.  If I have one complaint it's that the crust was a bit bland. For $8.99 for a large, with 4 toppings, you can't ask for much more though.  Gus's may be a different story at 3:00am on a Saturday when 10,000 ASU kids are ordering pizza, but I highly recommend it for a quick and easy weeknight dinner!

I'll preface this by saying that I'm a big Caffe Boa fan. I've hosted parties there in the past and very much enjoy their food. Their service, unfortunately, leaves much to be desired.  Last night, with a reservation, we arrived for our 8:15 table. The hostess outside asked, "Would you like to sit inside or outside this evening?" Since it was so beautiful out, we answered "Outside." His response? "Unfortunately, we don't have anything available." Why would you even ask the question if you had already known that no outdoor seating was available?  We were seated indoors in a restaurant where literally only a single table, a couple on a date, was seated. Where were we seated? At the table immediately next to them. Seriously? When I asked to be moved, so our group wasn't talking in the couple's ears and vice versa, I was met with an upset attitude.  The food is fantastic, I'll give them that, but it's not enough to keep me (and apparently others since they were completely empty) coming back.

I can't say the food is terrible. Chelsea's Kitchen uses fresh ingredients and, for the most part, delivers a decent meal on its overpriced menu.  What disappointed me most about this restaurant was the service. All evening long we felt like our snooty waitress was not listening to us when we spoke. This was evident when the wrong appetizer was served to us and had to be sent back to the kitchen. Our water glasses remained empty all evening long, ketchup that was requested two times didn't arrive until after I was done eating, our plates, with food still on them, were cleared without our waitress asking if we were done with them, and our final bill was brought out to us without ever asking if we wanted dessert or an after dinner drink.  Service was so quick I felt like I was eating at an Applebee's.  Considering the number of similar restaurants in the area, I won't be back. While it has almost nothing to do with the food, It's a shame because service is something that can certainly be corrected if its important to management.

The gym is fine. It's your average, neighborhood gym. Even though the open hours have recently changed, the gym is no longer open 24/7, it's reasonably clean and the equipment seems to be in decent enough shape.  The issue I had is in regards to their customer service and the way I was treated when, in an emergency, I had to cancel my gym membership.  I went to the gym to cancel my membership on September 29, the day I found out I would no longer be able to be a member of the facility. I was told that I would still need to pay my $30 annual fee on October 1 because that's what I had agreed to three years ago, through the Planet Fitness website, prior to Fit Zone taking ownership. I asked to have their manager give me a call to discus this.  Jaime, apparently one of the owners, contacted me on September 30 and let me know that there would be absolutely no refund issued, and that I was out of luck. While I could have dealt with the disappointment, there was no need for her to chide me and have an attitude. I can only assume that a business that's chasing $30 from a former customer must be in dire straights. Best of luck to Jaime and the rest of her team at Fit Zone. I know that, in my industry, if I spoke to a customer, current or former, the way she spoke to me, I'd lose my job. I'm not certain what allows her to treat people this way. I guess if you own the gym, it's your prerogative. It's still not good business. It would have been easy, and totally reasonable for her to issue a refund. I was made aware that if I had stopped in to the gym prior to September 25, I wouldn't be required to pay the annual fee.  I have a hard time understanding why I'm required to pay an annual fee when there will be no use of the gym, or an annual membership. I'm going to dispute this charge through my credit card company and let them handle it from here. Bad, bad business.

Just to let you all know, since 17 of you found this 'Useful', Visa ruled in our favor and waived all charges associated with Fit Zone who would not return a phone call to contest the charges.

Had to eat here with coworkers for lunch today and was incredibly disappointed. My $8 caesar salad was probably the tiniest I've ever had. Service was slow, the entire table was nearly finished before mine arrived, and staff was unapologetic. I've had side salads larger than the full salad they served me for lunch. Overall a miserable experience and I won't be back.

Bryan came to help my wife and I fix an outlet that had broken. Originally he gave me detailed instructions over the phone but when I couldn't handle the work a few days later, he came over.  His service was amazing! He's a guy who understands customer service and the value of it. He was pick, prompt and courteous. Quite honestly, this was one of THE BEST customer service experiences I've ever had... in ANY industry.  I highly recommend Bryan and certainly won't hesitate to use him again.  Thank you!

So sad to hear that this place is closing. We've been in for Sunday brunch a few times and both the service and food are always fantastic. What a deal at $35/person, with unlimited champagne and mimosas, too. Yesterday's lobster poutine, seared wild salmon and chocolate profiteroles were all perfect. Definitely a sad, sad loss for the Scottsdale food community!

It really pains me to write this review because the service at FnB is always top notch. The friendly crew is on top of everything without being overly intrusive, they're kind and they have plenty of knowledge regarding their menu and wine list. They go above and beyond to create a great atmosphere.  My problem last night was the food. Holy cow was it bad! Each vegetable dish came out swimming in piles of oil. At one point I looked to my wife and said something to the effect of, "Wow... there's so much oil on this plate, my fork is literally sliding out of my hand." We shared six vegetarian dishes, each more oily than the dish prior. The meal got progressively worse. Sunchokes drowned in oil, leaks drowned in oil, you get the picture.  We've been to FnB before and usually enjoy the food. This trip was a disaster though and I don't think we'll be heading back. In the words of Tom Colicchio on Top Chef, "Did you even try the food before sending it out of the kitchen?" would be my question to the chef. Overall, great service, and that's the only reason for the second star, a very poor dining experience this time around.

This was quite possibly my worst dining experience since moving to Phoenix about six months ago.  My wife and I eat out quite frequently and had heard decent reviews about Spasso. We decided to visit the restaurant last night with another couple.  The food was overpriced and only average. We ordered their mozzarella plate that was served with soggy vegetables and 3 tiny pieces of cheese. For almost $15 I would have expected more. While the mozzarella was the highlight of our meal, imagine sharing 3 pieces of cheese amongst 4 people. This was the BIGGEST mozzarella plate that was offered on the menu.  Our calamari appetizer was chewy and lukewarm at best. The pizzas were alright, nothing spectacular. Very much your run of the mill pizzeria.  Service is where this restaurant falls flat on its face. Their website, along with our waitress, speaks that the restaurant closes at 10pm.  At 9:15 we tried to order a bottle of wine and were told that we couldn't have the bottle because they were closing. The "manager" turned the lights off in the bar and brought us our check.  For a restaurant as empty as this place was, I couldn't believe they would have turned down the chance to make an additional $40. Their manager knows his business way more than I do and maybe he's doing so well he simply didn't need our $40.  That being said, I've never been denied service in a restaurant and I've never been told so blatantly and rudely to leave.  We won't be back and I suggest you take your money elsewhere.

I called Plumbing Experts strictly based on the reviews I saw here on Yelp.  The 5 star reviews couldn't have been more true. Aaron showed up on time, was very professional and had my faucet working in no time.  He saved me over $300 and his repairs only took a few minutes.  I can't thank him and his company enough for its fantastic work. Without a doubt I recommend Plumbing Experts for your needs!  5 star guys!

We used to love Beckett's Table. The ambiance inside the restaurant is great and the service matches. Everybody is friendly and attentive. That being said, my wife and I ate here on Friday, June 10 and, while it's sad to report, the food left much to be desired. Our appetizers, the Deviled Egg of the Day and the Mac 'n Cheese were each completely devoid of any flavor. The same can be said for the Scottish Salmon and the grits. We found ourselves filling each of our dishes with salt just to bring some additional flavor to our plates. My wife's shrimp, from her shrimp and grits, were appropriately seasoned and enjoyable.  My fingers are crossed that Chef Beckett can figure out his food and take this restaurant back to what it was just a few months ago. We'll continue to dine and support local establishments and, once they've fixed their food, hopefully Beckett's table works its way back into our local rotation.

I could easily eat 50 of these fish tacos... they're that good, and that affordable.  My wife and I both agreed that these fish tacos were as good as anything we've had in Baja California.  We ordered two fish tacos, one shrimp taco, a carne asada taco, a bean and cheese burrito, and also had a Diet Coke. The grand total for all of this deliciousness? $12. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.  Service was quick, the gentleman at the counter was unbelievably friendly and you can't beat the food.  Easy five stars for Tacos Atoyac. We've kept this restaurant on our list of places to try for the last two years. We finally went this past weekend and, without a doubt, we'll be back next weekend. As close to perfect a dining experience you will ever find!

My wife and I had been looking forward to a meal at Distrito for some time. When we arrived at 8pm on a Thursday night, we were the ONLY people in the restaurant. That should have been a telling sign that possibly it was time to look elsewhere for dinner.  Before our appetizers arrived, we enjoyed the cornbread with chipotle honey and citrus butter. This was tremendous, and we had hoped a prelude of the meal to come.  We started with the fish tacos and octopus appetizers. We're fairly educated foodies from NYC, with a great appreciation for an amazing Phoenix food culture after living here for nearly three years, and have eaten in some of the nicest restaurants in the world. We both agreed the Rubios fish taco is better than that served at Distrito. The fish was alright, but the tortilla was stale and overall, it was dry at best. The octopus was fine, nothing to write home about.  We shared the Skuna Bay Salmon and the Garlic Prawn entrees. I kid you not that we couldn't finish our salmon entree because it was so sweet. In a pasilla pepper broth, I would have expected some heat... not a piece of candied salmon with raisins. This was very disappointing. The shrimp entree wasn't bad, but we both agreed it tasted no different from the tequila citrus shrimp that we, not formally trained chefs, make at home.  The entire meal lasted less than an hour. The service reminded me of what you might receive at an Applebee's. We never had even five minutes to enjoy alone before we either brought our next course or approached. I stood up to use the restroom in the middle of the meal and noticed that much of the staff was sitting at the restaurant's bar. Regardless of how empty a restaurant is, and this one was completely empty, I would never allow my staff to sit at the bar. It just looks bad.  Average food at best + poor service + high prices = most likely not going to return.  What a disappointing experience for a meal we were quite looking forward to.

Very, very much a fan. Had a nice dinner outside at Bink's Scottsdale last night. Our waiter, Chad was menu-knowledgeable and we enjoyed the food very much. Having been to Bink's Midtown a few months back, and not loving our meals, we were hesitant to try Bink's Scottsdale, but I'm happy to report that we very much enjoyed the experience. The three of us shared the kale and quinoa salad, fries, sweet potatoes, smashed potatoes, cauliflower, bolognese, rainbow trout, mussels, chocolate puddin' cake and frozen orange soup. I wouldn't order the smashed potatoes or the frozen orange soup again, but everything else was excellent.  Very affordable meal for that area of town as well. Highly recommended!
