10 out of 5 stars for the Grilled beef!!! You will not be disappointed! Also love their Lobster dynamite roll. Everything else are good as well.   As for sushi, this place is ranked  #1 on my list of best sushi in town.  The place is small, so make reservation before you go.

Just my favorite place for getting meat! Prime ribs, lamb chops are the best around the area!

Just found out that the Joe's Crab in the southern location and this one have different ingredients. Not sure about other flavors, but definitely the spicy boil is much better in this location. 5 stars for anything in spicy boil, but other flavors are a 4 star for me.

The worst hotel experience ever! I booked two king rooms.First it was fine.They upgraded me to a suite of two bedrooms. After I got in the room and find out there's only one king bed, I called the front desk and ask if I can change to king bed rooms, although I don't have to change. They said that was a down grade from what I have, I said ok, the queen beds are too small for us. They said ok, you just need to come down to the lobby. I packed my luggage and go back to the front desk, and then they told me there's no king beds! NON! Why don't you tell me when I called??They said they can only put me in two rooms with two queens. I was going to keep the suite and not making the change, then they told me the room is gone!  Before I said anything, they cancelled my suite, and give it to somebody else! WTF! This is not it. I found the manager and told him the story and guess what he said?! "Did you know the king size is not guaranteed? Did you get what you have booked for??" I said," yes! I'm talking about your service not weather I get what I paid for!" Then he goes," Ok, I get it. I will make a note to the system that you had issues"  THAT IS IT! Not even a "Sorry"! What a great manager!!-----The hotel itself was also disgusting! Someone's vomit was on the hallway outside the elevator for the whole night. The casino was raining inside because of the flood outside. If you can afford $20 more per day, get another hotel, PLEASE! Do not put your vacation in risk!

We went there several times in the past including lunch and dinner. The sandwich for lunch is great, but the pizza and desserts for dinner is my favorite!! Romantic atmosphere, great for couple and family. Definitely the best pizza I ever had in Phoenix!

First of all, the food there is definitely a FIVE star!  I will rate my first visit a 5 star: the food is just over the top, and chef is super cool and friendly, great atmosphere. Everything we experienced on the first visit is just unforgettable!   So, we decided to go again. One time we have an important guest coming to Phoenix, and I was highly recommended this place. I want to call ahead of time and make sure that we will have a table when we get there. Although the phone went to voice mail every time for two days. Then we finally decided to just drive by without making reservation. We ended up with no table available, and we have to find another place to eat. A little disappointed, but we thought that might be just coincidence. So we went there the third time. Again the same thing happened, not able to make reservation( this time we got hold of the chef, but he told us no reservations for lunch), and the place was full with a big party when we got there. Both times were in the weekend.  OK, the place is only open from Thu.-Sun., which we really feel like impossible for us to eat there again.   This is the #1 place I recommended to everybody come visit Phoenix, but every time we have guests coming, we just can't account for its availability, so sometimes we'll have to leave it out of the plan.   But anyway, we will still keep trying. Hopefully we will be luckier when the fourth visit.

I never expected the owner to reply my review, but Chris did. No business is perfect just like all of us. The most important thing is that the business is trying to solve the problems. For a business owner who cares about every customer's opinion, there's no batter business man he can be!

Their Raman is not professional, and not even near professional. The tastes are all different every time I came for the same item. Too salty this time...I mean really salty! Disappointed...

My official favorite fastfood place! They had your name and what you wear wrote done on the order. So you can just sit down and relax, the food will come to you. The servers ware sooo nice and professional! The chicken was very crispy and tender!

After leaving the last review, the owner contacted me apologized and invited us to visit again. We have not go yet, but I will give a 5 start for their positive attitude  :-P I respect business owners that take their customer seriously.

we had the buffalo chk, vannilla bean and built it with veg egg and buckwheat. The buffalo is a little salty for me, and they are so kind to change it to breakfast burrito for me. Love the vanilla bean! Just love it! Although the breakfast burrito is still too salty for me, but the sweet ones are so good!

They are the best Chinese food in town! The chief had a restaurant at Chandler back on 2009, and we were regular customers even we were to drive 40 mins every time from home. Now they finally opened one near ASU, and man, I was soooooo happy! Eat there whenever I can. Just my favorite place!

I always go there for food, and never tried their drinks. The food was a little slow, but they are good! Worth the wait.

Cindy cut my hair in a very professional way, and I'm always happy when I leave. I had some special request on how to cut my hair, and she did the job perfectly. People were asking where did I get my hair done,  and all my friends love it.  She also did my makeup before. She is a very nice and patient, I would recommend her to my friends for hair cut and makeups. I heard she is also doing facials. I will definitely go back and try it sometimes.

Been here for few times since they open, and love the food and people! Recommend for everybody. They are doing delivery now, which is a plus for students in ASU.  Love their sticky rice roll, pork steak with rice, kong pao chk and much more~~Since it is so close to my work and home, I'm eating there almost everyday now, and haven't get tired of it yet. You can also request dishes that's not on the menu! Love it!

Love this place. I almost go there every other day. Unlike Bao said, I love their #1 Banh Mi. Maybe because I only have Lee's sandwich to compare with, which I think this place is waaay better then Lee's. I always order #1 and no bake (the bread is softer). Tried some other ones, still like #1 the best.  I have bought these sandwiches to my friends and let them try it. They all got addicted to it like I do. Lol. The only thing I wish they can change: they close at 7pm and 6pm on Mondays~Which means I can't have my #1 Banh Mi for dinner most of the time... sad...

If you are looking for authentic Chinese food, this is the place to go. The owner had two restaurants in the valley before this. I was always a big fans for his place no matter how far he opened the restaurant at. Me and my husband now go there almost every day because this one is close to my house, how lucky! Love it as always!

I ordered a small Japanese pan Noodle.. and the portion is very small! I mean very, maybe just 2 or 3 bite size. And the taste is just ...terrible. I ordered the Japanese Noodle part is because they said it's a little spicy. It is not spicy at all. There's no taste except a little bitter. The only thing that has a little flavor is the mushroom.. Plus for the price, I don't think I will ever come back again. Sorry.
