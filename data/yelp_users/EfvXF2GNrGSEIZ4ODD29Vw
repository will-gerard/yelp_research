Come to this place really hungry! Because my eyes were like bigger than my stomach! I wanted to order everything on the menu! This place has biscuits and gravy, grits anything southern....you name it!  The manger was super nice and tried to accommodate my daughter who has severe allergies to dairy. He tried his best, but this place is certainly not for VEGANS!

Good quality food & nice staff, our server SAM, rocks! She was attentive, kind, and full of knowledge about the food and refreshments.  Try the Oktoberfest beer! Then make sure to have dessert--they can make the desserts in a smaller portion size. Mall parking, nice location and comfy and cozy atmosphere.

This place has the worst atmosphere on the planet, it is neither romantic nor relaxed. The could use music, better lighting, and better service. All together I give this place a 2 because the only thing that made the experience somewhat worthwhile was the fact that so many people were there and so it made it easy to start a conversation. My server and food came cold and the drinks although cheap took forever to get.

Really Great food! Really nice staff and very clean environment. I felt that the location was perfect for people who are not interested in large crowds and want fast efficient service.

This place was not worth it to me. Food was adequate and the only thing it had going for it was the atmosphere. The architecture of the place was nice but, the service was lacking. I waited 10 minutes for water and well, lemon... we didn't get that until the end of the meal.  The price was reasonable so I guess bad service could be expected.

This store is run just like the company. Not organized, bad service, trouble getting answers and not to mention overpriced, I found all the same items online for a lot less. I will be cancelling my Sally beauty club card and getting on without this terribly run store and this company altogether. They will/ should be out of business soon with this kind of service.  Btw, I was told I couldn't return an online purchase in store even though I had the box it came in, receipt in hand and my cc I used to purchase the item.

I LOVE the food here! Good Portions, with enough to take some home. Wish they wouldn't be so stingy on the wine though; if paying for a glass of wine I certainly don't want a 1/3 of a glass.  Otherwise, very clean, quaint and inviting atmosphere. And fellas the waitress' here wear very tight clothing so...if your like into that!  I dig the fact that they have two bars, and one is outside! YAY! Take your friends and have a nice dinner here.

I wouldn't give any stars if possible! Went in and waited 1hr for the guy to start my relaxer, then he resumed asking questions to a manager that was too busy to pay attention. Fast forward 4 hrs hrs later and I have burn marks all over my scalp that has me in so much pain that I consult with the floor manager and she gives me a facial moisture lotion that is supposed to help. Well it helps for about ten minutes and then with chemicals in my hair and a very inexperienced stylist ( if he could even be called that) he is now blow drying  the chemicals he failed to wash out of my hair deeper into my skin. After having one side of my hair dried and feeling sick to my stomach, like i wanted to vomit, I decided to leave and tell them I don't wish to continue with this experience. Asking for my money, I politely refuse showing the manager what my hair looked and felt like and instead she offers me to come back two weeks later for more trauma. Also, refusing to accept the fact that I shouldn't have to pay she then reduces the cost to a 50% off discount!  Needless to say I will never be returning. And you should STAY AWAY!

This place is alright. Nice Chiro very gentle so if your like me and like to hear the cracking of your back then don't expect it. It's $19 for first visit and $29 thereafter. I would suggest getting one of their packages because it would remain $19 that way.  It's very convenient though. Just walk in scan your card and get adjusted which takes less than 5 minutes.  The guy before me spent 3 minutes! Geez! For $19 they should have a few of those massage chairs in the waiting area so you can loosen up before your adjustment.

This place is fast but give you little food! I ordered a pho soup with chicken and extra shrimp and got 2oz of chicken and 2 shrimp. I will not be going back. They also don't understand English at all! So it was very difficult to communicate with them.

Worst customer service ever and a smartness employee named Ricardo. Who thinks he's a know it all! I asked questions and he would only find smart ass answers to put me down. He doesn't realize that I could afford any of those phones and only needed answers that were helpful. Not ridiculous insinuations about the iphonec " the c" doesn't stand for cheap! Will never go back to this location. Not to mention they don't even acknowledge you when you walk in even though their door makes a chime noise.

These people who believe this place is reasonable in price is nuts. You get salty chicken and greasy fat for $20 definitely not worth a trip back?   I remember El Pollo loco being tasty and healthy with lots of wonderful fresh salsa to choose from. Now the salsa is watered down and the guacamole taste like crsp. Hope they lower the price and stop ripping people off.

The food here is fantastic! I have no complaints. Good service, good food. I was told that management changed in last 6 months but, I ate here 18 moths ago and then again very recently and I can't see any difference with regards to the food. So far so good. Will keep coming here. Oh, if you need more sauce just ask! They are very willing to give you more if that's what you like.

This place is terrible. Overpriced, & rushed. It took then 4 minutes to do a pedicure and 5 to do a manicure.
