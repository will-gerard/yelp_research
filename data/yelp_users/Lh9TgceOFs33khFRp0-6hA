We went here after lots if people raved about the pretzels and pizza. We got the pretzels an they were below average. The atmosphere was terrible (ugly decor) and our service was some of the worst I've ever had...all around a terrible pick. Will never go back and would never recommend it..

Loved the strawberry preserve on sourdough toast. The potatoes were a little under cooked though. Cool atmosphere and good service.
