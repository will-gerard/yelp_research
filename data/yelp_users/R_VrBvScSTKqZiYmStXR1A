I got the Apollo. The bread was good but they forgot the cheese and they only put one slice of meat on it. I was pretty much just eating bread, lettuce, tomato, guacamole and BBQ sauce (which is an odd combo). Will be my first and last time eating there unfortunately.

Based on some of the reviews, I was excited to go try a new place on Mill. I had the Steak Cobb salad and I was very disappointed. The steak was tough and very cold, like they just pulled it the fridge. The ranch was very runny and watery. Ncounter is across the sidewalk and they have a similar salad, at a cheaper price, and much better taste. The people I was with both got the Tri-Tip Steak Sandwich. Both said the meat was tough and it was not heated up enough. The BBQ sauce isn't anything impressive. Based on the lack of people in the restaurant, I don't imagine this staying open for longer than a year. Hopefully they lower their prices, include sides in the price, up their quality of food, and create good lunch specials for the people who work on Mill. A BBQ place has good potential on Mill, but since there is such high competition in the area, they are really going to have to do something to make themselves stand out. The best thing about this place was the service, everyone was really nice and attentive to the few customers in there.
