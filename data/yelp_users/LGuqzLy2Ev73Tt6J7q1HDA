Not only is this place dirty, they are ALWAYS out of everything. You want Italian herbs and cheese bread? Too bad. Did you want avocado on your sandwich? Not here.   Oh, but what they do have is tons of bad attitude from the red head cashier.

Worst restaurant experience I have ever had. The waitress was absolutely terrible. After not being able to answer any of the questions about her menu, I got tired of waiting for a refill, so I walked to the server station, and asked another server to get more water. Then wanting to pay for my bland shrimp order and leave this dump took absolutely forever. Definitely go somewhere else to waste money on crappy service and food.

Terrible. Longest wait in a drive thru ever. Just to find out they forgot to put things in the bag. The only thing I can count on from this TB is bad service. Always messing up the order.

Super fun, pool tables, darts, and Golden Tee on a gorgeous TV.  Draft beer tastes terrible. Multiple tries, might be bad lines.

Fun. Two Golden Tee machines, pool tables, darts. Plain dive bar, with some decent food.

I would love to review this place just by it's food, but I cannot. I wasn't able to have a raspberry filled donut, because they were out. Nor could I try the cinnamon roll donut because, (although it's on the menu) they don't make it yet.  The whole reason I decided to write this Yelp! review is because of the service I received. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE AND UNACCEPTABLE.  I'm not going to go on about how I'm a manager in the hospitality business (even though I am) and that the was I was treated was down right disrespectful. The man in the drive-thru window was just absolutely rude and abrasive, and if we was my employee, I would have terminated him immediately.   I will never go to Bosa Donuts, and I will also tell all my friends and family not to go to this place. I hope management reads this and makes an adjustment.

I might be biased, but Ryan the bartender is a great asset to this bar. Great service.

Terrible. Debit card machine on pump never works. And seriously, it's 2013, quit charging for debit card use, you stupid dinosaurs.

It's rare I give 5 stars, but the tacos here are great. Good service, better music.   Unfortunately, I'm going to go with a 4 star review because the Moscow Mule drink that I received was flat. But I'm willing to give it another shot due to good service.

I had high expectations for this bar. The bar is extremely bland, and the staff just doesn't care. Came in after opening just to be ignored by the bartender on a slow night. Put some stuff on the walls, and hire a staff that actually cares.

Absolutely terrible. If my nightclub looked like garbage I would have tons of smoke machines too. A drink got spilled ON ME (within 3 minutes if being there) and they dragged me out by my neck. Security manager didn't care either about how much force they used, I hope these hot head bouncers get sued.
