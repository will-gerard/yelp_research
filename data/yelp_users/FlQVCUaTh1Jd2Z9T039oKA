I love this place. I haven't experienced the server issues that some other people have been posting about - maybe I'm just lucky?  If you're a microbrew fan, always check the chalkboard where they post their seasonals. You can't go wrong w/ the Light Rail Cream Ale, the Hef, or the Vanilla Porter. I absolutely loved their Pilsner when they had that on tap.   Their food is pretty good, but I wouldn't really classify this as a dining destination - this place is about the beer. I was disappointed in the Kobe burger, and I wouldn't order it again. The brat was just OK. Onion rings were so good but I wouldn't get them again because I'm pretty sure they are 1 million calories EACH and they gave me like 6 huge ones! The mac & cheese is so good. Salads are nice & fresh, the baja shrimp tacos really kick butt.   I also like the ambiance of the place. Cool setup in the brewers' den and the funky patio in between the brewers den and the main bar area. For giggles don't forget to check out the murals on the patio wall and also on the back wall of the parking area.

Great place for a very leisurely dinner. Seriously, it's gonna take 3 hours so I hope you like who you're with!!   NOT GOOD FOR FIRST DATES.   When I'm there I usually get the dinner for 2 with whoever i'm with - cheese fondue, salad & meat courses. Then we're STUFFED with no room for dessert. Here are a few alternatives I've found:  1. Go in and order individual dinners, not the dinner for 2 thing. This way you each get a meat course (I think it comes w/ salad too)  and then you will have room for dessert.   2. Go in JUST for dessert. (This is my favorite thing to do with my sister - it's great girl time!) Have a very light dinner at home or wherever and then you can sit and eat chocolate fondue yumminess and drink good coffee. (They have great coffee). I also highly recommend the espresso martini.

I hit this place for lunch, a LOT. I can't keep my boy co-workers away from it. They're lured in by the greasy double cheeseburgers with mesquite bbq sauce and bacon and blue cheese, and captivated by the onion rings and french fries. I am too... I should probably save some calories and JUST order french fries and onion rings when I go.   Good greasy food and - my co-workers couldn't help but notice - waitresses are very easy on the eyes :)

The food is good. Some major deals to be had during happy hour. Here's a tip... they happy hour on weekends too, and it's much less crowded than it is the rest of the week.   The patio is in a very undesirable location. View of the parking lot, exhaust fumes, etc, yes - it sucks. But this should demonstrate to you that the happy hour deals are just that good :-)   And the last time i was there they mixed up a the best mojito i've had.

I almost hate to review this bar because I love it and I'm not sure I want it to get crowded :-) It's great that it's hidden away and hard to find, you don't even know it's there until you're right in front of it.   If I'm in old town on a weekend night and I want a QUIET place to go and have a few drinks with someone, this is where I go. J. Chew's is JUST a tavern. No food, no DJ's, no dancing, no pool or darts. However it has a fantastic ambiance. A huge 2-story fireplace outside. A 2nd story patio that overlooks the park & old town. This is a FANTASTIC place to take a date for a drink, by the way!  It can be very romantic!   The inside is very small, literally there is room only for the bar. But they have a large outdoor seating area that opens onto the Scottsdale Civic center plaza mall/park, and they have an upstairs section with a big fireplace that is really cozy on a chilly night.   They play good music, but you never know what it'll be. It's the bartender's choice and sometimes they let the patrons call out a suggestion.  Drinks are pricy here even by Scottsdale standards. But it works. Between the prices & the laid back quiet atmosphere, this is a bar for grown-ups, not kids. And the bartenders know how to mix a drink.

What a great little shop. You can spend half the day just browsing through this little store. The housewares section has some really cool stuff if you're into asian decor. The sake selection is huge. Check it out if you're in the neighborhood.

Fun bar. Gets PACKED during happy hour, and on weekends after 9pm. Sometimes the music is a little too loud to hold a dinner conversation. But hey maybe I'm just getting old.  The sushi is CONSISTENTLY good, above average good. Yes, as other reviewers noted, you can find better. But no other sushi place I've been to in Arizona can consistently serve up good fish every time I come in.

The Italian Grotto isn't exactly for the faint of heart. The waitstaff is mostly a bunch of older guys from new york and they are a little gruff and direct. Personally, I like it. They once chastisted my sister for moving her bread plate :) The guy said "Your bread plate goes to the LEFT of your dinner plate!" and we didn't really know what to say to that, LOL! I am sure that a lot of people are offended by this, but what can I say? I like smartasses!  I've been here twice now. Giving this place 4 stars might be a touch of a stretch because I absolutely noticed some problems. Here we go:  Appetizers: I've had the fried zucchini and the fried calamari. Both obviously homemade and fantastic. Calamari was very tender and not at all chewy. Zucchini needed a little salt, but after that it was perfect.   Salad: I love a salad that doesn't look like it came out of a bag. I've had the blue cheese twice now and I doubt I'll try anything else soon because I like those big ol chunks of blue cheese in there!  Entrees: On my first trip, I tried the Chilean sea bass pomodoro on top of ravioli. The sea bass was great, and the pomodoro sauce was just incredible, but the ravioli tasted gummy and bland, and I actually feared it might have been frozen... God, I hope not. Incidentally, I wanted to ask the server if it was the endangered chilean sea bass or if it was farmed... since it's being overfished and all... but I was genuinely afraid to ask my server about this since I was pretty sure he would call me a name that ends with "ussy" and starts with a P, and roll his eyes at my yuppie self. On this same visit, a friend of mine had a chicken dish which was SADLY overcooked and dry was could be, and another friend had the fruits del mer (?), a fettucine alfredo with calamari, salmon, shrimp, scallops and mussels, and it was great, all the fish was cooked to perfection. My next trip I had the sea bass florentine (I KNOW, I should have tried something else, but I just love me some sea bass) and it was incredibly good, seabass topped with spinach and ricotta. However, they forgot to season either the fish or the spinach, but after I salted the dish I thought it was fantastic. My friend had the ravioli pomodoro and she thought it was great, so maybe she didn't think they were gummy, maybe I just caught the raviolis on a bad night!  My recurring issue is that I don't think the chef(s) are properly seasoning the food, if they WERE, I would probably give them 5 stars right now.  However, given that MINOR issue, there is so little good old-fashioned Italian food in this town that the Italian Grotto still has almost no competition, and they WERE mostly fantastic! So, I will be back, no doubt at all. I'll just remember to leave my bread plate on the left and not ask any wussy questions about sustainable fish :)

I love the Papago Peak brewery. What the other reviewers put about their stock of tap & bottled beer is true. And the food is great too.  Papago generally attracts an older (25-40) crowd, which is nice.   My only complaint about Papago is that it has bare floor & walls and it tends to get very LOUD in there. Not a place to go for intimate conversation, you kinda have to shout to be heard. But it's all worth it!!

I've been a member here for 2 years now. I have to say I'm pretty stuck on the place, I even quit & re-joined.   I have pretty simply gym needs. All I want is a good elliptical and some weights. and I don't want to have to wait, at all. I always go towards the end of peak times (6-7pm) and I have never had to wait for an elliptical, ever. They keep them well maintained, too. They have so many weights that even if someone is on the weight machine I need, I just use another till they're off of it, and I never feel like I'm right on top of my neighbor there either - usually I have my pick of the machines.   It is very annoying when their pushy sales people or vendor partners try to talk to you at the door. I've gotten to the point where I just pretend I'm talking on my cell phone as I walk by if I see them. They want the names and numbers of your friends... no thanks, dude, they wouldn't be my friends long if I gave 'em out to you, now would they?   The parties they throw are also annoying. A DJ? Balloons? It's a gym... not a party.   The personal trainers are OK, I fell for their little deal when I first started. They do an OK job training you, I just resented the high-pressure sales tactics in retrospect. A tip if you join - if you want to avoid the personal trainer sell, just don't make an appointment for your free "personal trainer consultation". Or if they make you do it, call & cancel and keep putting it off. That's the sales pitch. It's NOT really a personal training session, that's B.S.   But the place is always clean, staff is always helpful and smiling (if they aren't selling you something) and machines are kept in great condition and available. The only way I could see this getting better is if someone else could do the workout for me :)

This is my favorite little mexican taqueria in the neighborhood.   It's GREASY as can be. However the food is really tasty if you can handle the grease. Sometimes that's what you want!

This place is pretty much packed all the time. I have tried going on tuesday nights, wednesday nights - you can get a table, usually, but it's still really busy. I avoid it completely on friday & saturday nights now. People spend 2 hours at the bar waiting for their table and by the time dinner comes they're loaded. It's something you only want to deal with if you're drunk yourself.   The sushi is incredibly hit and miss here. I've been there and had tuna sashimi that was just perfect, and the next time I go back it's so awful I can't eat it. So I don't go here for sushi anymore.   I like the teppanyaki tables where they cook in front of you. I'm a huge fan of the sea bass. The kobe beef is also fantastic... when I can afford it! lol  I think the teppanyaki food is very well done and that's what I get when I come here.  Other great dishes are the kobe burger, and the wasabi shrimp cocktail.

Los Sombreros is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. The food is always just perfect. The prices are extremely reasonable. I modeled my own guacamole recipe after theirs, it's that good. Try the specials of the day, they're always great.   The service has been a little hit & miss for me. Most of the time they're fine. There's this one woman who is extremely unfriendly. I think she just doesn't like me :-) But ya know, with food & ambiance like this, it doesn't bother me if I occasionally end up with a cranky server!

The sushi was not good enough, to me, to make up for the table next to me. There was a large table of about 10 people, probably in their early to mid 20s, and they had been enjoying quite a few alcoholic beverages. Now I'll NEVER hate on anyone for that, but they were being stupid and annoying. One guy at the table threw his water glass into the aisle - twice. Broke two glasses. I kept waiting for the staff to kick him out. They cleaned up the glass and didn't say a word to this a$$. I was in shock that they didn't even speak to him about his behavior. Acting like a destructive child.   Ya know, I realize they're running a business, and they had a large table, but it's offensive to me that they didn't speak to him to protect their OTHER PAYING PATRONS. And this is why I'm not going back to stingray.  Plus - they have fishies in the floor. I'm concerned for the fishies' welfare. Remember when you a kid and your mom told you not to tap on the fish aquarium because the fish don't like it? I wonder how they like the tap dance that the foyer floor gets nightly :-(

I've been to the Bada Boom Pasta Room a few times. I had low expectations given the location and the kitschy name. But to my surprise the food was really pretty good.  The asparagus appetizer is not to be missed. Neither is their tiramisu. They serve up a great cup of coffee as well.   The previous reviewer is right - the service is so-so. They didn't foul up anything big but neither were they impressive.

I just went to Red Robin a few months ago. When I walked in I realized WHY I had never been there. It's a family friendly joint - so you never know when little junior will start screaming or running through the aisles. Thankfully, that only happens about 20% of the time I'm there, probably because I'm there on weekdays for lunch.  I have to admit though, they have consistently good food. Not creative, just basic stuff, but tasty. The salads in particular are really great (and I'm picky about lettuce and salad dressings). Plus they'll bring you fries for free - all ya have to do is ask :-)   My co-workers won't let me stop going, but then again I don't fight them too hard.

I feel the need to explain my 2-star rating, because I come here with regularity. Every so often I just jones for an emerald chicken quesadilla, smothered in their salsa.   The service is hit & miss. There is one particular employee who is awful, the rest are okay - very friendly. But communication is not their strong suit. For example, one day I tried to order a rice bowl WITH a quesadilla. They did not tell me that I can't have a quesadilla with a rice bowl, so I ended up with emerald chicken over rice - no quesadilla. No warning, or I'd have changed my order. They also refused to fix my existing order, they told me I'd have to put in a new order for a quesadilla - no refund on the rice bowl I didn't want. Just today, I put in a to-go order and came home to find they put something... not emerald chicken, I don't know WHAT it is - in my quesadilla. In their defense, they were busy, and I'm sure it's hard to tell what's in a quesadilla. Just disappointing when literally, that is the only reason I go there.  Many people seem to love their fried rice - I don't think it's anything special. Likewise with the beans - they are good, not spectacular. I love the jade red chicken and the diablo chicken. The pork tends to be too fatty for my tastes. The cookies are okay. The SALSA is something special (don't miss it - they put it in a big container by the fountain drink dispenser), I love it and if they sold it in jars I'd probably buy it.   The good news is that I did find the emerald chicken recipe online http://www.foodieslikeusblog.com/recipes/guy-fieri-dishes-on-tattoos-foodies-and-changing-lives/ (allll the way at the bottom) and I've made it - it really does replicate it well! The bad news is that 80% of the time I'm too lazy to make it myself... so back to Chino Bandido I go.  PS - Every so often... they run OUT of chicken. Really, it's the weirdest thing to me. How does a restaurant run out of chicken? But it's happened 3 times to me here. Since I go there for the chicken dishes, I just leave when that happens.   PPS - I really hope the Chino staff doesn't see my review and muck with my food next time I go... I need a Yelp alias.

I finally checked out this store after months of meaning to go in there, and I'm so glad I did. I love their stuff. This beats the heck out of the supermarket spices. And they are reasonably priced too - about the same as what you'd pay at the grocery store.  If you are dieting or trying to eat less salt, you need to RUN, not walk , to Penzey's. Their spices add so much flavor to food. The Chicago Steak Seasoning is fantastic, adds a nice smoky flavor to everything. They bill it as a seasoning for any grilled item, but I put it on a meatless pasta the other day and it was fantastic.   I also bought smoked spanish paprika. I am pretty sure that is my new favorite spice.   The danger is this store is that it's gonna make you go out and learn to cook new things just so you can use the spices you bought :-)  UPDATE:  Years and many trips to Penzey's later, my current favorite spice blend of theirs is Sunny Paris. It's so good on veggies, but I've even been known to toss it into ramen :O The staff is super helpful. I was looking for grains of paradise which Penzey's does not stock, and the ladies gave me two places to go which did stock grains of paradise. Thanks Ladies! I'm upping them to 5 stars :)

Ouch. This particular location of the Islands chain of restaurants just opened in north Scottsdale a month or two ago. The food is good - hence the 2 stars. The service is a complete mess.   Everything started off fine with our table of seven. The waiter brought us our drink orders and took our food orders. Then we waited and waited. We wanted drink refills but no waiter to be found.   Finally one of the runners (hope that's the right term - the people who deliver the food when your waiter doesn't bring out the food) came and attempted to start passing out the dishes. But it wasn't our order. The server insisted that it was for our table and passed out as many orders as she could, if they remotely matched our order. She took the rest back to the kitchen.  Two minutes later a manager type came to our table and took back the food, saying that it had been misdelivered and it was meant for another table. We took this opportunity to hit him up for drink refills and he said he'd send someone out...  A minute or two after that... out comes the same runner, and delivers all the same dishes to the table NEXT TO OURS! By this time, we're cracking up at MY table because the table next to us had to have heard the whole incident with us insisting this isn't our order, and now the kitchen is very obviously serving up the exact same plates of food to the table next to us. To complete the irony, the table next to us happened to be people who work for the same company we do and we know them all :-)   Our waiter returned with drink refills and our food came out a few minutes later. Everyone agreed, the food was good. My salad (and  those of you who have read my other reviews know I'm REALLY picky on salad) was great. The guys' burgers were great. The fries were quite yummy. Only one error - one guy ordered nachos without sour cream, and got them with sour cream. Not bad for a table of 7, those errors happen all the time in my experience.   The manager type ended up coming back to our table and comping us the order of fries for our troubles with the order and the long delay on getting a refill.   The kitchen is doing a good job, but the wait staff is obviously brand new and doesn't have their act together at all. In a few months they'll likely have all those problems sorted out - in which case i'll return to Islands and see if I can re-rate their star level!

I'd probably give this place 5 stars, except that no place deserves 5 stars until I've had at least three stellar experiences there. Give me a few weeks, I bet I can make that happen.  I stopped in here on Sunday for lunch about 1pm. We walked in to this small, narrow... PACKED bar. Misconception #1, it never occurred to me that we might not be able to get a table!! There was one very large rectangular table near the back, and thankfully the trio seated on just one side of the huge table, graciously allowed my party of two to take the other side. Whew.  I ordered a beer (The waitress even recommended one that wasn't on the menu yet, nice touch) and my sister, who is much better behaved than I am, ordered a water. I ordered the chicken tikka masala pasty (I'm sure it's not really traditional but I have a thing for indian food at the moment) and my  sister got the Chicken Greek.   And we waited... and waited. OK, Misconception #2  :) I mistakenly thought this would be sort of a fast-food place.  It wasn't! It was about a 40 minute wait for the food. And I am NOT complaining... I'm just saying... I had a misconception! It was SO GOOD I'd have waited double the time (although I'd be drunk by that time, considering what a good beer selection they  have, no good would come from that!). Incidentally, the service was quite good and responsive, especially considering how busy they were.   My chicken tikka masala was very flavorful, but only slightly spicy (The waitress told me they make their curry in-house, I assume they make it only mildly spicy to accommodate all diners), I was impressed. My only complaint is that the potatoes inside my tikka masala pasty were still quite firm... but that's probably a matter of personal preference. I like potatoes well done, not still firm. My sister was very happy with her Chicken Greek and she's such a picky eater (I love you Julie!) that it's a damn miracle she liked it that much.   Oh, and our bill was like $22.00. Awesome, I can afford to come here all the time!! We will certainly be back, I look forward to being able to upgrade this place to 5 stars.

This is the mother of all spas.  OK, maybe I'm exaggerating. But it's by far the nicest spa I've been to. This was actually my FIRST spa experience and going home to Scottsdale Arizona (which isn't exactly a slouch in the spa department) I haven't found a spa yet that can measure up to Spa Mandalay.  The spa is very large, with a reception room with refreshments, magazines and flat screens, a quiet room, a sauna, eucalyptus scented steam room (I think this was my favorite part), and the piece de resistance, their cold plunge/warm pool/hot tub room. It's women only (at least, on MY side! I assume they have the same for men) and literally there is everything you could want. Cold sliced cucumbers for your eyes and icy cold washcloths? Check (and perfect for a hangover, incidentally). Showers and a sink area filled with literally everything you need to primp, from perfume to hair dryers? Check. A locker room so huge that there isn't anyone changing around you? Check!   My massage was great too! But what truly knocked me out was the spa facility. I swear, I'm going to go here EVERY time I go to vegas, even if I just get a day pass and just veg out in the spa for few hours :)

I've been getting a basket from BB every few weeks for the past few months. Disclaimer: I always get the regular basket, I've never tried the organic one.   WHAT IS BOUNTIFUL BASKETS? They are a buying cooperative who uses the power of bulk purchasing to buy produce cheaply and distribute it out. You go on their website on Tuesday or Wednesday and make your purchase. Then you show up at a predetermined site (you choose from a list of sites & pickup times) on saturday morning and pickup your produce. Bring a lot of bags, or a laundry basket, to cart your stuff home in. And um, make sure you have room in the fridge for it all, and some plastic bags at home to store the stuff in.   Pros: 1. A TON - literally, a TON of fruits & veggies for $16.50. You cannot beat the price. 2. I go into IRON CHEF mode when I get home and figure out how to prepare my bounty of stuff!! Sorted by level of ripeness I will plan out meals. I've never received anything overripe, but some stuff needs to be used up within a day or two, and other things are far from being ripe yet. For example, this week I got about 10 completely green bananas. But I also got a swiss chard and bok choy that looked like they had to be cooked within about 2 days, so I found recipes using them and now I have lunch for all week. I still have a head of napa cabbage in the fridge, I have a yummy salad planned for that baby...  3. I love finding new stuff in my basket. This week I got pickling cucumbers. Who what whoa?! I went and bought mason jars... I guess i'm gonna learn how to make me some pickles :) Refrigerator dills only, of course!   (Disclaimer, I am a total foodie who loves to cook. I'm sure not everyone wants to go all Iron Chef in their kitchen every saturday morning. I'm just weird like that.) There are always one or two things in the basket that are completely new to me and sometimes unidentifiable... I love that!  4. BUY THE INGREDIENT PACKS when they are offered. Plan on cooking a meal or two off of what they offer you. The monetary value is always VERY good on the ingredient packs. I think since they're more unique ingredients they're more expensive... no way you could buy them at the store for what you are paying BB. In the mexican ingredient pack, the tomatillos alone almost cover your ingredient pack cost.    Cons: 1. Have to plan in advance and purchase your basket online 4 days before, have to make a special trip - and super early unless you are lazy like me and go to Kodiak produce at 11am on a saturday - and go to a spot at a prearranged time, and wait in a line, and pick up your stuff. It's not convenient, in fact it's a bit of a pain. But it's CHEAP and that's why it's setup that way. (I am sooo lazy though! I should work on that)  2. I sometimes end up with a lot of something that I do not like or cannot use in time. I'm single, so the basket is way more than a single person needs, unless they are a vegetarian! Thankfully my sister lives nearby so I'll end up giving her about 1/3 of my basket when I get one. She got the mushrooms this week (eww, fungi) 3. Sometimes the produce isn't what I'd buy for myself. They give out apples EVERY week... and this past week they were Fuji apples. Which are okay. But if I were buying them, i'd get honeycrisp or pink ladies. (God, I'm a snob. I should work on that.)  4. Remember, this isn't a CSA. It's not organic, and it's not coming from a local farm. BB is a buying cooperative, it's like our own little Produce CostCo. So it's the exact same stuff you will find at Safeway, Fry's, Albertsons, Bashas. If what you are looking to do is support a local grower... you do not want Bountiful Baskets. 5. Their website is horrible. "1996 called, they want their website back". I'm not web savvy enough, but man if I could, I would design them a new site. The one they have is extremely user un-friendly. At least it's not slow, and your purchases ARE encrypted.   I volunteered last week at the Kodiak location. They are always looking for volunteers to pack the baskets beforehand. It's dirty work, you're in a warehouse unpacking cases of fruits and veggies that are on ice and leaking. Yes, as one reviewer mentioned, the veggies are dirty. This isn't a supermarket and there is no one getting paid to make it pretty.  Overall - I love Bountiful Baskets but I still recognize its weaknesses. I do spot a business opportunity though. Pay an extra $5 for someone to go pick up my basket for me and deliver it to my house... it'd be worth it... (See, lazy!)

After a year of basketing, I have  to downgrade Bountiful Baskets. The quality was never exceptional, but nonetheless I'm seeing the quality continue to decline. Too much produce that is spoiled within a day or two. I'm really getting tired of certain staples they throw in EVERY week (lousy apples, romaine lettuce). I bought a case of honeycrisp apples when they were in on special - extremely disappointing. They were tiny and started to spoil after just a few days. (That may have been my fault for not taking them out of the case immediately and checking for "bad" apples.)   Bountiful Baskets is more concerned with quantity over quality, which is fine because that's their whole M.O. I'm just tired of it and will have to look into a CSA.

I'm a big fan of this place. Sadly, I haven't tried that many dishes because every time I go in, I HAVE to get the gyro and the greek salad. I hope one day to be able to broaden my palate and report on their other dishes.   The gyro is good - YES as another reviewer stated, it's greasy. That's why it's yummy. Skip the fries, they are nothing special compared to the other two sides available. The white rice with tomato sauce is awfully tasty but the greek salad is my favorite and it's what I get every time now. Nice fresh lettuce and a variety of veggies! I'm so picky about that.  Disappointment: One day while the cook rang me up for my gyro plate (Feeds 2 for under $10, you can't beat it) he was telling me how great his baklava is. So when I went to a dinner party the next week I stopped in and bought some to bring for dessert. Sadly, the baklava was not to my personal liking. It was chock-full of nuts as he described but there was not enough phyllo dough or especially HONEY for my tastes. Rather dry and nutty, not sweet enough for me. Oh well!

At 8pm on a Friday night, Moira was shockingly quiet, only 4-5 tables filled in the restaurant. it suited us perfectly though. We sat at the sushi bar and were immediately attended to by a waiter and one of the chefs. Definite props on the service, they were attentive and helpful.   I was pretty excited to hear they had kona kampachi, so we started with two pieces of the kona, tuna sashimi and a shrimp tempura roll. The roll was fine, the tuna looked great, but it had that slightly chewy fat line in it (I really hate that... so disappointing) but the kona kampachi nigiri was so good we immediately ordered a sashimi plate of it. Really outstanding and generously sized pieces of it too. We followed that up with unagi nigiri which was fantastic.  Overall, I thought the sushi was very good - other than the tuna everything was spot-on how it's supposed to be.  I really didn't think the prices were unreasonable (you want some sushi that isn't worth the prices, go to Pure in old town... oy vey), and the portions looked perfect to me. I really really hope that the tuna is better next time I go, though :(   Since a few people mentioned the chairs, I'll give you my opinion on them...  Since we were at the sushi bar, we were on barstools. Once I was up on the chair I was very comfortable... it was just the getting up onto it, and off of it, IN A SKIRT, after a sake bomber, that was difficult :) You'll see what I mean if you go!  Note: I was disappointed that my usual Kirin was not available, but just had an Asahi instead... they had many asian beers I wasn't familiar with, maybe next time I'll be adventurous and try one of them....

I FINALLY talked a friend into going to Petite Maison for brunch on saturday! He is low-carbing, but he said, "surprise him" as long as the place had meat or salad entrees.. mwahaha!   My friend got the Salade à la Niçoise with Salmon. I didn't taste it, but he said it was great. It LOOKED great.  Considering he is a graduate of a le cordon bleu cooking school, I believe him when he says something is good. I'm just a hopeless amateur :)   I ordered the Oeufs Maison. OMG. I have always had a thing for poached eggs with hollandaise (what? it's not like it's hard to love) and this was perfect. A perfectly crisped buttered piece of toast (brioche) topped with 3 perfectly al dente asparagus spears, topped with 2 pieces of an interesting spicy cajun sausage called boudin blanc, then 2 perfectly poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. Actually, my date reminded me about halfway through that my hollandaise was not really hollandaise according to the menu... it was sauce maltaise which from what I understand is similar to a hollandaise but contains citrus (juice or zest?) It DID have a slightly orange citrusy flavor. All I cared about is that it was good.  I hope to return soon... I have PLANS for that foie gras, salade maison, and cheese plate!

Now that I've dined here twice... I'm gonna hold Petite Maison at 4 stars.   Monday night, 7:30 - my reservation got my party of 2 the last table in the place. (Whew. it's so small in there.) The service was fantastic, although it's so odd to go to a full restaurant and be given so much time to have a leisurely meal... especially when they're full. For example, after the hostess sat us and gave us our menus, about 2 minutes later the waiter came by and after doing his introductory speech, said he would give us a few more minutes to become familiar with the menu... lol... I was ready to give my drink order, but okay! We also had to request the bill. I am pretty sure they would have let us linger with our coffee for a full hour if we'd wanted to :O   Really weird not to be rushed out!   Oh, onto the food! The most important part!  My friend ordered the escargot, which, since i'm very "meh" on escargot, I can't tell you if they were good or not even though I had two of them at my friend's prompting. She also had the trout almondine  - omg fantastic, I'd order it next time. Whatever dressing they had the salad greens and green beans in, was incredible, and I don't even care for green beans, but YUM... I ordered the house salad and the foie gras. The foie gras was very good, certainly the rarest I've ever had it served. I'm not sure how I feel about the accoutrements - the vinegary accent sauce, the pickled grapes, the roasted apples, on top of a (I felt, a little burned) piece of brioche. I've had better combinations with foie gras, to be honest. But it was still good enough that I ate the whole thing. The salad was also good, I really enjoyed the roasted shallot vineagrette, but to be honest it felt like the salad was missing something... not perfectly seasoned, to my tastes, I think it needed a little salt. :(   The chocolate creme brulee was also my friend's choice (I'd have tried the souffle if it had been up to me!). The creme brulee was good - even great - but I'm a traditionalist, and while delicious, I prefer non-chocolated-up brulees :) PS - Do not attempt to eat the candied orange garnish on top of the creme brulee. LOL   All in all, despite a few very minor concerns about my meal, I'll be back. The bottom line is, the price is right (It's amazing how cheap we got outta there, really), the service is fantastic, the atmosphere is cute and cozy, and the food is pretty great. Solid 4 stars. Next time, I'm thinking that flat iron steak.

Warning: the previous reviews were when Lara was running Petit Fromage. I'm sad to say that I stopped in there today and found that apparently now Delicious Dishes is running Petit Fromage and Lara is no longer involved? What a disappointment! The lady who showed us the cheeses was more than happy to help us, but the cheese selection was not the same. Nothing super unique, it's more like the cheese case at Safeway now. No meats in the case, either. I enjoyed having someone knowledgeable to explain the unique cheeses so it's a shame that this place has changed.

The Pink Pony is a scottsdale institution, I think. So I finally made it into here for dinner one Friday night. It's very dim with dark furniture & paneling - think supper club.   It wasn't the best steak I've ever had but it was good and certainly very reasonably priced! I was sitting in a booth near the bar & the stage. I thoroughly enjoyed the lounge singer! He was cheesy & funny and he appears to have quite a following. While we were sitting there eating, the bar was filling up & up & up with folks in their 40s-70s, dressed to the NINES. (I want to be like that when I'm old!) They were singing & dancing and generally having a fantastic time.   When my parents visit I want to take them here. I think they will think it's a "hoot".
