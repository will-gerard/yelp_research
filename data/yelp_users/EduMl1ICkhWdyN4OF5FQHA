If you like coconut, then you have to try the new coconut frappacino's. They taste like a Samoa girl scout cookie blended in a cup. I'm usually an iced coffee kind-of-girl but when I sampled this wonder drink, I changed my order and enjoyed a little sip of paradise instead.

This is the perfect spot if you're looking an intimate date or a Girls Night Out or a celebration dinner or a family gathering. Basically any time. Try the veggie burger -- it's my favorite burger in the entire valley. Oh and the Greyhound! I could wax poetic about this drink, but won't. Instead, I'll just tell you that ordering just one guarantees a happy ending to any night. And yes, feel free to interpret that any way you want.

I loved Postino's. Loved, as in past tense. Living in the area for the last several years, Postino's was my go-to place for everything from Saturday night celebrations to making a Monday just a little special. The wine is great, the menu is perfect, the ambiance is downright delightful. It's the staff that makes me cringe. On a recent visit, the snobby hostess told us the wait was 2 hours... But no one was there ... And there were empty tables ... Something did not seem right and when I asked her about it again, she rudely just stared at me. 2 hours later, we got seated and ignored. It took another hour (!) for our bruschetta to arrive to our table. We left feeling hungry  and  neglected. The worst part is that I started to ask around and I have three (3) other friends with almost the exact same experience. After so many happy years at Postino's, I won't go back to the Arcadia location. On the bright side, the Central location boasts the same menu minus the horrid staff.

Skip the downtown wait: head to the new location at 22nd Street and Camelback. Same famous pies minus the infamous lines.

Delux is amazing! The turkey burger is one of my favorites. Ask for Phillip -- he's the best server. Oh and if you have a sweet tooth or are celebrating ANYTHING, get the milkshake. Thank me later. :)

If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then consider Wildflower's Chopped Salad an edible tribute to The Original, Chopped Salad that is. Taking a leaf (ha!) out of Cowboy Ciao's playbook, Wildflower created a sumptuous version that mirrors, not copies, the salad so famous it has it's own Facebook page. Seriously. https://www.facebook.com/TheOriginalChoppedSalad    I've had the original and agree it's divine, but in the showdown of similarly named salads, my pick is the Chopped Salad from Wildflower and here's why:   1. Price. At under $8, I can (and do!) eat this salad weekly without worrying about my wallet. The Original Chopped Salad is a whopping $12.   2. Convenience: With multiple Wildflower locations, I can cave into my craving for this salad for lunch or dinner while in Phoenix or Gilbert or Scottsdale or wherever.   3. Size: In this case, size does matter and the Chopped Salad from Wildflower seems almost twice the size of the Original Chopped Salad.   In the battle of chopped salads, I declare Wildflower the winner!

Service with a smile plus honesty -- hard to find in the car care industry. I'd like to give a shout-out to Jesse, who hooked me up with lots of free services. I will be a client for life.

This review ends with me driving away in a sleek, white MINI, with a huge smile on my face!  The entire process, from test driving to signing papers, was enjoyable, pleasant even! I worked with "Smitty" who treated me like a father would treat his very spoiled daughter! He literally held my hand from the first test drive to financing to showing me how to use my new MINI. Best car buying experience of my life. Not to mention a hot little car. 5+ stars for MINI of Tempe!

Chestnut just doesn't care. Being the new kid on the block and set in a gorgeous location, Chestnut doesn't have to work hard. And it shows.  My friend and I were excited to go to the hot new spot and left super disappointed.
