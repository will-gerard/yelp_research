Anyone who's been reading the reviews I have posted since we moved to the Phoenix area knows I have been in search of good chile rellenos.  It's been frustrating.  How hard is it to take a poblano, roast and peel it, stuff it with cheese, batter it, fry it, arrange it on a plate and dribble sauce on it?  (Well, obviously not SO easy or I'd make the damn things at home!)    So DH and DD (Dear Dog) and I took a road trip to Tucson to check out Mt. Lemmon.  (It rained---what was that all about?)  and we come cruising back into the Phoenix area about 8.30 pm Saturday night and DH is asking what we are having for dinner.  "Whatever we stop and pick up", says me!  I am thinking Mexican in my head, but unlike back in the old 'Hood, there ain't a Mexican joint on every corner.  I guess we like Mexican food a lot more in the Midwest, or maybe it's because most Arizonians know how to make it at home and Ohioians don't or something.  So we are driving past Indian Bend exit off 101 and I remember I saw this fast food Mexican restaurant there when we went to LampsPlus.  So I tell DH and he recognizes the name Filiberto's.  Apparently, this was the after-hours food of choice when his brother and his friends had the munchies after a night of bar-hopping.  They said it was really good, DH says, but I don't know how toasted they were when they ate it.  But we figure---what the heck....  Well, first of all, the shopping center parking lot is like a carnival.  Full of cars and people.  Apparently, they are having the world's biggest cruise-in!  But the line is short at the Filiberto's drive-thru so we pull up.  OH.  MY.  GOSH.  Number 17.  Two chile rellenos.  Okay, calm down.  This is a fast food joint.  I have been let down at some fine restaurants when it comes to rellenos.  So I order the #17, hold the rice, extra refried beans.  In the meantime, a car with a Big Muffler and a Big Stereo pulls up behind us going bruuuuum...bruuuuum.....!  Now DH doesn't eat a lot of Mexican (he's all about Italian) and he hates loud noises and we are kind of tired and nervy after a lot of hiking and driving and basically starving to death so he gets stressed and orders the #7, then as we sit, starts b*****ing because he got shredded beef and he hates shredded beef because it's always garbage.  Which I don't get, because you really don't know what's in hamburger, but that's just a spousal conflict.  (I do have reason for mentioning this---read on)    One thing we notice is that looking through the drive-thru window, the food prep area was SPOTLESS!  As DH said, you could have eaten off the floor.  Big Points!  Window girl asks if we want red or green chile sauce.  We order both and she brings us three little cups of each.  I will mention that when we tried it, we found it bland and unexciting, but I told DH that a lot of times, servers will err on the cautious side because a lot of people don't like spicy the way we do.  All the way back to Cave Creek, delicious aromas are eddying up from the bag.  SERIOUSLY delicious.  We almost fall over each other getting into the house.  Okay---cut to the chase.  I think I have found my relleno nirvana.  Oh, wow, they were good.  And so were the beans.  Right on par with Sammy's Burritos and Burgers!  And I was eating them lukewarm because I didn't want to heat up the guac, pico, sour cream and lettuce that was in the carry-out box and we were too lazy and hungry to empty things out onto plates.  Oh, the deep fried, cheesy, peppery goodness...  I can't explain how happy that makes me!  Now, remember I mentioned DH and the shredded beef?  He could not say enough good things about the taste and high quality of the beef in the taco.  He thought the whole meal was fresh and of excellent quality and not at all "fast-foody".  In fact, he immediately texted his brother (who now lives in Cleveland) to say: wow.  I couldn't eat my whole meal, so I had about half for the next day.  I could hardly wait for lunch---surely the goodness of that relleno was the result of starvation.  Nope---and this time I took the time to separate cold from hot and warm up the beans and relleno.  It was as good as a leftover for Sunday lunch as it was dinner on Saturday.  Yummo!  So, I am going to have Filiberto's again very soon to see if this was an anomaly or these chile rellenos are this good all the time.  My only caveat is the closest Filiberto's is SIXTEEN MILES from my house.  What---are they prejudiced against Northern Phoenix?  What's this all about?  Why do they only have Filiberto's at Bell Road and further south.  Don't folks north of Bell deserve the good stuff?  I mean--Taco Bell?  Huh.  But I am very excited.  Yay!  Thank you, Filibertos---you have made me so happy!

Love Filiberto's---love Filiberto's---love Filiberto's!  Everytime is as good as the first!  (But also, the red and green sauce has remained the same---fortunately, we have a goodly supply of Arizona Gunslinger Green Sauce at home!)  Please, Filiberto's, we need a location closer to Cave Creek and Carefree!  I promise I'll come order a #17 at least twice a week!

I expected more.  Got less.  Service was lackluster, from the manager who delivered a breadbasket that was empty but for crumbs and herb butter that was acrid with powdered garlic.  We did get some bread eventually...once our server deigned to drop by the table.  His lack of engagement has been forewarned in repeated Yelps, but we were willing to overlook it for good Italian...however...  We started with Roma Garden house salad with the house dressing.  Crisp lettuce, a few crescents of red onion, two wedges of decent tomato and a sprinkling of canned, sliced black olives, all coated with a disgustingly sweet homemade dressing.  I only ate a little of my 6.95 salad...DH,  however, liked the dressing, comparing it to poppy seed without the poppy seeds.  For dinner DH ordered chicken parmesan and I ordered the veal piedmontese.  Both were advertised as served with pasta.  DH'S oval platter had a glob of rigatoni to one side, a pile of sloppy foodservice frozen veggies to the other, and in the middle, a bounty of tomato sauce concealing a chicken cutlet.  DH said the quality of the chicken was good, but the breading was slimy and sauce acidic and unbalanced.  He thought his entree had been microwaved, the heat was so intense.  He was not pleased.  My veal came with a white wine-lemon-butter sauce with canned mushrooms and artichokes which was quite good, and the veal was tender, but flaccid and unseasoned.  It also came with the unappealing rigatoni and frozen veggies.  How much preferable to have some plain pasta, like angel hair or linguini to sop up unexpectedly tasty sauce.    DH ate about three bites of his chicken parm.  I finished the veal and what sauce I could scoop up.  It's a very pretty restaurant with cloth tablecloths and napkins and sparkling glassware.  But mediocre food and service takes it off our list for a return visit.  Too bad.

Shopping at Desert Ridge and it was past lunchtime.   Despite there being only two or three tables occupied and several hours past standard lunch hours, it was a bit untidy.  A few littered tables, some bits on the floor, the salsa bar needed straightened. (Minus a point)  I was waited on at the counter by the manager, who greeted me with a big smile and was very pleasant and patient as I studied the menu.  As it was my first time, I decided to go for the Famous Fish Tacos plate.  They gave me my number, my pop cup, and I mosied over to the salsa bar and filled up some cups with different salsas to try before settling at a high-top by the window.  It wasn't long before another smiling counter-person brought out my order and checked to make sure I had everything I neeed.  Very nice level of service.  Then things started going downhill.  The fish tacos---they  tasted very, very, VERY fishy.  In fact, I started to worry that maybe the fish had gone bad.  (Of course, I didn't think of that until I was halfway thru my second taco!  Eeeek!)  (Minus another point) Now the beans were very good---super tasty!---in fact, I should have gone with just a big plate of them!  But the killing blow---and so many eating establishments, both fast, casual and fine do this and I don't know why!!!!???---was as I started my meal, the manager started sweeping up around my table with a broom and dustpan as I ate.  As I said, the dining room was basically empty, she could have started anywhere else.  Better yet, she could have done something less dust-raising, like clean off the table tops or tidy the salsa bar or clean a bathroom or iron money or SOMETHING!  Do these people not realize what an absolute turn-off it is to be trying to eat and imagining dust from countless other diners wafting around your food?  Yuck!  So, MAJOR point reduction.  Would I eat here again---maybe, maybe not.  There's quite a few quick eat places at Desert Ridge to try out and even though I didn't get sick, there was something not right about those fish tacos.  Or maybe that's just how they taste at Rubios---but I have had fish tacos before that have been delightful.  These were not.    And, like I said, it just irks me to be swept around when I am eating.  So, like I said, maybe...maybe not.

I feel bad that a Baby Cow died in vain. TG we had a Localdines certificate because if we had paid full price, I would be totally peed off.  Attended the Scottsdale Philharmonic concert Sunday afternoon  just down the street, & as La Torretta was conveniently located & as DH had been longing to try it for over a year & as we had certificate...    Arrived a little early for our reservation (Open Table) but they seated us immediately, at 6 pm, as only about 3 tables were occupied. First impression: dated. Cheesy 80's goomba, which can be kind of cool. Ceiling has this "broken" area so it's supposed to look like an old ruin & you are looking up out an ancient building to the sky. There is a mural on the wall of a naked woman (Venus?) with ornery little cherubs buzzing around her. It was done by an extraordinarily talented artist---the skin tones glow, but still she is in All Her Glory, so I'd feel funny with a younger child in tow. Mostly, I was unimpressed by the cleanliness.  Too much Restaurant Impossible? The carpet was really grimy & I could see thick layers of dust of the back edges of the chairs & supports, & also on the top of the velvet drapes. Told DH NOT to go near the drapes during dinner as I didn't want that crap sifting down on my food!  Ordered wine---very happy with our selections & the prices per glass were reasonable. The wine was little slow to come out, but glassware sparkling clean. Our server recited the specials & my eyes lit up when she mentioned Osso Buco. I LOVE Osso Buco. Fortunately, as I contemplated that, another young man came with basket of bread & oil. One bite of dry, tasteless roll & equally tasteless oil & I became hesitant to spend $43 on the veal shanks. Oil served in a gravy boat with large spoon---very odd. If you poured oil from boat, you got none of the herbs and whatever in it---but the spoon was so large that to take it out of the gravy boat you had to tilt it and lose half the contents. It didn't matter---it had no flavor at all, despite lots of bits & pieces floating in it. I decided to go with the Gorgonzola salad with strawberry vinaigrette & Cannelloni Fiorentino & Gnocchi. Kind of a weird, carb-heavy combo, but description of the cannelloni sounded delicious. DH also got the salad & Pollo Farcito Formaggio Quattro.    Well, our salads finally arrived about 6.37.  (Yes, by this time I am checking my watch.)  Admittedly, dining room starting to fill up &  appeared our server was only one working, but really? I almost gagged on first bite---so incredibly sweet. But as I started to get the tart, pungent gorgonzola along with the sweet vinaigrette, it was delicious. Also included blackberries & raspberries & candied pecans & greens VERY fresh, so ended up being very good. Took our time, but how long can you linger over a salad?  Probably finished about 6.50. Server did stop in for a moment & we ordered another round of wine. Thank goodness, because our entrees finally appeared---I kid you not---at 7.17 pm. So the runner pops them down before us & I am looking at my plate & not feeling good about this. Looked like two cannelloni just visible under a layer of something---it looked like TVP (texturized vegetable protein). Tasted like it too---tasted like nothing.  There was no seasoning, no depth of flavor--nada. The chicken filling inside was the consistency of baby food and again, no seasoning. I won't say it was disgusting---it was just flavorless. It WAS hot, I can say that! The gnocchi---and I find it hard to believe they were house-made, were actually cooked well, but again, no flavor, despite large pieces of mushrooms tossed in the bland cream sauce.  The veggies were cooked tender-crisp, but again---no seasoning. DH said his chicken was well cooked (I had a taste and I thought it was a little overcooked) but only a whisper of the sweet, rich flavor of marsala. Even rosemary potatoes that accompanied---this is kind of gross, but DH got a couple of hard needles of rosemary caught between his teeth & when he wiggled them out & then chewed them, said it was like eating straw. Obviously, not using fresh herbs in the kitchen & considering even the dried had no flavor, assume it was old, bulk stuff. Potatoes though, were hot & steamy & cooked very nicely.  Server stopped by, looked at my plate & said "No parmesan?"  I told her I had not been offered any.  So she whisked away & came back & generously sprinkled shredded parmesan on my dish. Some flavor now? No.  Was that dryish, plastic parm they sell in giant bags from food services. Ugh.  Disheartened, we gave up and had the busboy box remainders, hoping I could "flavor up" at home. Waited 18 minutes for server to notice we were ready for our bill. Another 9 minutes to get the credit receipt.  Really?  I feel bad because DH was really looking forward to this restaurant.  What a let-down. Really surprised at all the positive reviews, but then I see Yelp filtered all the 1 & 2 star.  Hmmm.   Cannot recommend.

We have been clients of Crystal Falls Pool Services since Jan, 2013.  And, woo-hoo!  They are as good as it gets.  The tech never fails to show up as scheduled---we could set a clock by his timely arrival.  Always neatly dressed, courteous---super-nice---and we have had three different guys thru the months.  They take excellent care of our pool---it never smells like chlorine, the water sparkles, it looks great.  Our pool and equipment were almost 19 years old---the tile had been neglected and was all calcified from well water and the equipment was at last gasp.  We had cause to call Crystal Falls a couple of times for repairs and they showed up quickly, understood we were trying to "baby" the system along for a little longer, and always managed to get it back up and performing as well as could be expected for a minimal cost.  When we finally decided to bite the bullet and get the tile re-done and a new salt water system and heater put in, we got three estimates.  Crystal Falls came in with the best price.  When we wanted to add some expensive bells and whistles, they explained to us what would and could work, what would be the most cost-effective----one contractor quoted to completely tear out our pebble-tec coating!  When it came time for the work to be done, as usual, they showed up when they said they would, Edgar rocked out the new tile, they gently sand-blasted our stained pebble-tec so it almost looks new, Jordan did a great job at installing the new equipment, and Mike, the owner, came out and personally worked on hooking up the Aqualink remote stuff.  And when there was a problem because our wireless router wasn't compatible and we couldn't get the iPad linked in, he had an IT guy out here the next day.  It's all good now.  We are so happy with our "new" pool---the new tile looks great, the pebble-tec looks good, the new two-phase equipment is going to save us money, and we can actually heat the spa or pool if we want.  Oh, and the LED lighting---it is so cool.  We love to sit on patio at night and sip wine and play with the light combos!  We can't say enough good things about Crystal Falls or the guys!  Thank you!  We are very happy with your service!

I love The Good Egg.  Of course, I am a breakfast person---breakfast, lunch and dinner!  What could be better than something created from the incredible, edible egg?  This is the only Good Egg I have eaten at.  Everyone who works here is super nice and knows their job.  The hostess is VERY nice.    Normally I get the always delicious and incredibly filling Huevos Ranchero's, but the other day I opted for the Florentine Benedict with fruit on the side.  I asked our server what kind of fruit and he said a variety of melons and grapes...  I HATE melon!  Why does everybody fill their fruit cups with melons?  So I asked him if I could mostly have grapes in my fruit cup and he hesitated, and then said sure.  So my Florentine Benedict arrived.  Omg, it was so good!  Perfectly poached eggs, grilled mushroom, onions, tomato and spinach, with little chunks of bacon and a nice Hollandaise, all piled on a nicely toasted English muffin.  And I got a side bowl of nuthin' but grapes!  Perfecto!  We ate on the patio, it was really nice, except for this stupid fly that took a liking to me and my meal.  There were some big birds watching us avidly, but the staff is pretty much on top of it, clearing dishes asap, so those winged rats are out of luck.  I liked that they brought me my iced tea in a plastic take-away cup.  I had drink to...take away!  I think I'll ask for a take-away cup always, in the future.  (Unless I get coffee.)    I have filled up my Good Egg card and earned a free entree, and have started a new card.  Life is good.  Ahhh...life in Cave Creek-Carefree....it's EGG-zactly how life should be!

We went out with the Central AZ Jeepers the other night to do a night run of the Maggie Mine Trail.  The plan was to start up at Bumble Bee, come south to Black Canyon City, then finish at Rock Springs Cafe for dinner and pie.  First I have to mention we had a party of over 20 Jeeps and the trail is mostly visible from 17---we must have looked so cool, snaking along the mountain, our chair of headlights glowing in the night.  So if anyone took video...  So I was looking forward to Rock Springs Cafe.  We have driven past it a million times, but for one reason or another, never got the chance to stop in.  Finally!  Our organizer, Cheri, had fixed it up with the Cafe that they were going to get invaded by 30-some Jeepers, so there was seating when we got there.  Parking, not so much.  They were having some sort of party at an outdoor venue down below---it looked fun.  Good music!  We were with DS and DSGF and they decided they were just going to hang out in the parking lot and listen to the music, because sometimes teenagers are weird.  But that put the kibbosh on a relaxing meal followed with pie, so I can't comment on the food.  But I insisted DH and I go in for some of that famous pie and coffee.  It took a bit to get some service, but we had walked in with thirty-odd people, so no dings for that.  The coffee was good!  Hot and fresh!  I ordered the coconut meringue pie and DH ordered the JD pecan pie.  My pie was a mile high, had a good coconut flavor but was a tad sweet for my taste.  But I don't like super-sweet stuff.  I tend to cut back on the required sugar when I make desserts.  But it was very good.  Someone commented in another review they thought the crust was store-bought.  Maybe.  DH liked his bite of my pie.  I liked DH's pecan pie.  DH liked it, but he said mine is better.  (I make mine with chocolate chips and kahlua---go big or go home!)    It took about 10 minutes to get our server's attention to get our check, which came to about $12 for two slices of pie and a cup of coffee.  She muttered something at us when she gave us the ticket---I didn't quite catch it.  So after about five minutes of sitting at the table waiting for her to come back, we took the ticket and cc and went to the gift shop to pay.  We stood there for several minutes waiting for someone and then a girl showed up and said: oh, no, you don't pay here, you have to pay your server.  (Oh, that must have been what the server was telling us!)  So we went back in to the counter and found our server.  She took our ticket and the cc, and then started messing around on the POS and I swear we stood there for ANOTHER seven or eight minutes while she entered some orders and helped another server with a question.  Then she took our money.  So, basically, we spent more time trying to pay our bill than eating our pie!  LOL!  So, it was an okay experience.  I'd probably go back if there was a group vote to do so, but I don't think DH and I would stop on our own volition.  I liked DH's pie better than mine and he liked mine better than his, but we both agreed that the cup of coffee we shared was very good.  Definitely, management could do a better job on customer service.  But you see a lot of this: management thinks they are "saving money" by not having enough staff to take care of customers graciously and with efficiency, and then people stop coming because of the inadequate service.  Such is the way of the world!

BROW SERVICES  WERE FIVE STAR!!!!!! Nail service 1 star or less!!!!!!!    I bought a Groupon for three gel manis and pedis.  The Brow Lady is next to one of our favorite wine bars, so I thought that would work out great---park DH at Evo's, go get girly, then get treated to a nice dinner.  I made the appointment for the mani/pedi, then looking at my unruly brows, added on a brow shaping/wax.  I arrived at the The Brow Lady---receptionist was a nice young girl, and within moments I was greeted by Brandi, the Brow Artist.  I was with her for about 30 minutes.  She was wonderful.  Really warm, personable, professional.  She did a super job on my brows---gave a little more up-to-date shape, cleaned up all those "downies" (as she called them).  I was loving her.  She mentioned she does reflexology---so now I am really excited.  I am envisioning making monthly appointments, getting my brows tidied, my nails done, my feet rubbed.  Followed by a nice dinner and a glass of wine.  Does it get any better?  I work hard and a lot of hours, I cherish the rare hours I get to pamper myself.  For the service, Brandi had to remove the color I had penciled in on my brows, and after, she offered to fill it back in because who wants to go to dinner with pale brows?  I really liked the color pencil she used and how nicely it blended, so I ended up buying one.  In fact, I was eyeing their whole make-up bar wondering if it wasn't time I did a cosmetic update....  I know---I am a product slut.  Suffice to say, I was TOTALLY HAPPY with Brandi and her skill and customer service and I could easily have made her my "go-to" for brow care.  But...  I do want to mention this----I am a really good tipper.  And I ALWAYS tip full price on a Groupon, because I don't think the service person should have to suffer because I have a coupon.  And I was very happy with Brandi, so I tipped her 25%.  Then she passed me on to the nail tech...who did not speak to me, did not make eye contact, carried on slightly inappropriate conversation with the other nail techs and ignored me and obviously was not listening when I told her how I liked my nails shaped, overwhelmed me first with music from a laptop and then her cell phone (I like Alicia Keyes and Beyonce, but not full blast 18 inches from my ears!), made me writhe into awkward positions to get my fingertips under the uv light rather than arrange the work service so I could do it easily, got defensive and a little rude when she clipped my nails too short to shape them the way I like (I TOLD you before you started!), had bright red polish all over the skin at the sides of my nails and the finish of the nail was not smooth and mirror-like, but had ripples and divots.  I was so upset that when she made a shooing motion toward the pedi-chair and said: Go sit there, I told her no, I am skipping the pedi.  I wasn't going to let her do a thing further to me.  I already had a half-assed gel manicure that will cost me $10-$20 to get stripped.  Then when I went to check out---pay for the brow wax and pencil---receptionist asked if I wanted to leave a gratuity for Brandi and Ashley (that's when I found out nail tech's name).  TG I had already given Brandi her tip.  And for the first time ever---DH couldn't believe it when I told him-- I didn't leave even a single cent of tip for that  unprofessional, inept girl---that's how upset I was.  My few hours of pampering ended very badly.  And I will never set foot in the place again, so I have lost the money I spent on the Groupon.  You may wonder why I won't go there if I liked Brandi so much.  How do I know her and that nasty girl aren't BFF's?  Would you put your precious brows in the hands of someone who might have a vendetta against you for dissing her friend?  Plus, now I just have a bad taste in my mouth for the whole establishment.  But in my opinion, Brandi should be working at one of the high-end spas----she has the personality and skill and customer service.  It's a shame she is wasted on a poorly managed place like The Brow Lady---and I say poorly managed, because I certainly would not stand for an employee providing the kind of service that Ashley did, and I wasn't impressed by the behavior of any of the techs.  So I was really torn on how to rate my experience---I tried to cut it down the middle, but as they say---treat a customer right, they'll tell two people---treat a customer wrong, and they'll tell a hundred.

Almost a year to the first time we visited Razz's, we went back in company with another couple.  Stellar meal.  DH and I shared an appy of squash blossom stuffed with cheese, lobster and crab.  Absolutely delish and it was brought to our table already on separate plates, so DH and I did not have to pass the small appetizer plate back and forth for bites. Very thoughtful.  Our DC's got a spicy Indonesian noodle bowl called something like Bai Mai Goreng or something---who cares?  Our friend was kind enough to share a bite and it was outstanding.  Could easily have eaten a bowl of it as an entree.  And speaking of entrees,  And speaking of entrees---we two ladies got the duck breast  with lingonberry sauce and a  house blend farro.  Duck was cooked perfectly, just a hint of pinkness and not a bit dry an the fat beautifully rendered.  I didn't love the farro---a bit crunch for me---but my fellow duck-eater loved her's!  The gentlemen, respectively, got the chicken scalloppini and the steak special, and there were a lot of groans of delight emitting from that end of the table.  The art on the walls is remains kind of weird, but still a lovely, intimate ambiance and our service was quite good,  Razz's definitely will remain on our "re-visit" list!

DH just reminded me to write a review for Wilhelm.  Nicest, most honest group of guys ever.  They are so cool you just want to hang around the desk with them!  Every bit of work they have done for us has been prompt, done correctly the first time, and reasonably priced.  Once they missed something after diagnosing our vehicle, but when we brought the vehicle in for the actual work, they took care of that gratis because, as Ernie said: "We should have caught it during the diagnosis."  You got to appreciate the kind of ethic and integrity.  If you live anywhere near, they are the go-to repair guys!  Oh, heck, even if you don't live near, they are worth the drive!

DH suggested NYE dinner here.  I agreed excitedly.  I mean, c'mon, it's *Tonto*!  Plus I have eaten here once before.  It was lunch with some friends on the very pleasant patio with exceptional food and service.  Evidently, I missed Yelping it.  That happens.  Sorry!  Not so this time.  We arrived for our 8.45 reservation and were at our table within fifteen minutes.  Got seated by a large party who had already been imbibing and one of the guys had the most infectious laugh---DH and I found ourselves helplessly laughing along, even though we didn't know the joke!  That was kind of fun.  Dining room was full and everyone was buzzy with excitement and happiness.  We were excited!  Our server was a bit of a dud---he was exuding "I don't want to be here", but he showed up and took our wine orders.  Then he reappeared 10 minutes later and took our food orders.  (Runners were handling delivery of food and drinks)  I mean, we weren't there to be BFFs, right?  He did his job, albeit sans any pleasure, faux or real.  We were given the standard menu and the NYE menu.  The desert on the special menu looked to die for, so DH and I decided to split the special salad, which was greens with lobster and sear grapefruit vinagrette so we'd have room for the hazelnut torte.  Yum!  Well...at least we enjoyed that.  The salad.  We didn't get to the torte.  For entree, I order off the NYE menu---divers scallops on truffled pureed potatoes and brussel sprout leaves.  DH went for the 8 oz filet on the standard menu, ordered medium rare.  Our entrees arrived pretty quickly.  Mine was gorgeous, even though the four---FOUR---brussel sprout leaves made me laugh.  For $36 dollars, I couldn't have had five?  DH's was very pretty too, his potatoes came in an adorable mini iron skillet.  Problem: DH cut his steak open and it was literally raw inside.  Blue! I took a bite of my scallops and got a mouthful of sand. Nasty! So we wait for our server to check in and he never did, so finally, we flagged down a passing server, explained the problem.  She carried DH's steak off as well as my scallops.  I re-ordered the NY strip from the standard menu, cooked rare.  You see, I also ordered diver scallops at Cartwrights, Tonto's sister establishment, (see that Yelp) and got the same gritty issue.  Obviously, these kitchens don't know or don't care how to properly prepare scallops.  So they returned with our steaks.  DH's was HARDLY cooked any more than before, and he was totally disgusted.  Mine was in the same raw state, but I actually like my meat to moo (though not quite that much), so I managed to eat about a third, before we both decided we would take our food home and cook the meat properly.  Obviously, the buzz of the evening was killed and we couldn't wait to over-pay for our dismal meals.  As DH said, at least at Cartwrights, he had one of the best filets he's ever had.  There was little to recommend Tonto...    Well, I hear the weekend brunches are great and I really did have a wonderful lunch, so I might try brunch/lunch at Tonto again, but...  The whole dirty scallop thing kind of pees me off.  That's just pure laziness and poor training.  But I certainly wouldn't recommend them at either Tonto or Cartwrights 'til they get their act together.  And then bringing my husband a SECOND incorrectly prepared piece of steak....  I just don't expect that when paying almost forty bucks a plate.  I think I am paying for quality ingredients and knowledgable and caring preparation.  This was not a super way to bid farewell to 2014....  I don't know, we'll see.....

We had an excellent experience at Dynamite Creek.  Called to make an appt and they got us in that afternoon.  Alvin, the vet tech at the desk, greeted our pups by name when we walked in the door, even though he had never met them.  Chris, the other vet tech, immediately came out to meet the girls and say hello.  The facility is very clean and organized.  Dr. Tom entered the examining room within minutes of our appt time---he was very nice and thorough, asked a lot of questions.  But we liked that he was able to accept our most recent lab reports and exams, instead of insisting he had to run them again himself---unlike our previous vet.  He was very low maintenance and straight forward. We didn't feel like he was going to baffle us with a lot of medical terms and rambling scenarios, but shoot-from-the hip.  Or call us at 8 pm on a Saturday night after we waited a week for test results.  He gave our little girl all her shots and a check-up, and even though our older girl was up-to-date on her vaccines, he gave her a going over and said she looked good.  (And when we checked out, we saw he hadn't charged for that!)  But most importantly, our older girl really gets nervous at the vet---she shakes like a leaf and paces and pants.  I don't know what was going on at Dynamite Creek, but it must have good vibes.  She didn't shake at all and actually laid down and relaxed!!!!  We couldn't believe it.  And then, Dr. Tom and Alvin said we were good for everything, and unless we had a problem, they would see us next year!  So unlike a previous experience, where they wanted to do $250 tests every other month, but explaining why with so much medical jargon, we weren't sure what was going on!  We were so impressed and are very happy!

A very disappointing experience.  I am sure FAR does very good work and thank God we have people who care about lost, unloved pets, but people skills are as important as animal!  We stopped at the Pima Road facility as we were on our way down to a pet adoption event taking place down at one of the pets stores.  It was hard to find the adoption office and when we found it, there was no one there.  We waited about 7 or eight minutes, then thought maybe we were in the wrong place, so we went back out.  There was a fenced in area with someone obviously involved with FAR and two potential pet parents" and the adoptee.  Politely, we stood about 10 feet away from the enclosure so as not to impose or distract the dog while his future people got to know him.  After a few minutes, the FAR lady looked up and virtually growled at us (too much time with the pups?) "Is something wrong?"  Her tone and demeanor was very aggressive and unfriendly.  My husband told her there was nothing wrong, that we were hoping to adopt a young dog and had stopped in to see their rescues.  The FAR woman said, "If you want a puppy, we don't have any", and then turned back to the other people.  Ummm---we said "young" dog, not puppy, but frankly, we want our pet adoption to be fun and with people who share our excitement in adding a new member of the family.  This woman was not that person.  We certainly don't complain about an interviewing process that matches the right pet to the right family or fees that help support the shelter, but I draw the line at outright rudeness.  I expect better manners from my dog!  She could have at least smiled or---if she was feeling overworked, had just said someone will be with you in a moment.    Our search for "The Queen" continues, but it won't be at FAR.

The best thing I can say about Brisam's is that it is air-conditioned.  No, that was rude.  Actually, the service was pretty good.  It's pretty beat-up inside and we were seated at a table that had been wiped down but still had crumbs on the table-top and seat.  The tables are VERY close together.  It was about 5 pm and Happy Hour was in full-swing.  Almost every table was seated and the acoustics not so great, so even though DH and I sat catty-corner to one another, it was hard to hear each other.  It didn't help that a person of the female persuasion in the bar area was very happy, and for our entire meal made conversation or whinnied laughter at ear-splitting noise level.    The good thing, is that the average age of the clientele in the dining room made DH and I feel young and frisky!  I ordered the fish tacos with a dinner salad.  DH ordered the honey chicken sandwich.  DH got a glass of wine, I got ice tea.  My ice tea tasted like a hint of old pipes, but it was cold and came with a big ol' lemon wedge, and was okay once you got used to the weird flavor.  It would have been nice if server had refilled my glass once, because odd flavor or not, it was really hot and the afternoon sun beats on the front plate glass windows, making it a bit warm in the restaurant, even with the ac at top speed.  DH was happy with his wine---served at proper temp, the glass was clean, price acceptable.  Our salads were not very interesting and they were a weird combo of old and icky and new and crisp.  Half my salad was that big, yucky bitter yellow heart that should be tossed.  The other half was fresh green leaves and then those slimy dark green bits that come from a salad left in a bag or bin too long.  DH's was the same, excepting he didn't have as much lettuce heart in his.  Our salad dressings were good and the amount provided generous.  My fish tacos arrived accompanied by a bowl of black beans and "mexican" rice.  I could tell the black beans would have been really tasty if they hadn't been so over-salted I choked on my one and only bite.  DH tried a bite (he loves black beans) and his comment was; "J***s!" The rice was not memorable.  The fish tacos were so overcooked---there was nothing succulent or delicious about them, except the blackening seasoning was quite good.  DH said his sandwich was very tasty as far as seasoning and sauces go, but the chicken was overcooked, and this is a man who likes his meat cooked to the point of shoe leather.  He said the bun was very good.  DH's comment as we left was: "Hey, the food arrived hot".  And that is a positive point.    It was not an expensive meal.  I think if we want a quick, casual meal and we are in the area, why wouldn't we just drive the extra five minutes and go to Heart & Soul?  But if I was really, really hungry and for some reason not willing to drive up Cave Creek Road a piece, I'd try Brisam's again, because if you aren't concerned about noise-level or flavor, it does provide a goodly amount of food and acceptable pricing with decent service.

Since moving to Cave Creek, Carefree Station has become our "Go-To" place (we miss you, Red Onion and Hawthorn Grill, back in Ohio!).  Food is always fantabulous, service friendly and efficient without being unctuous, great ambiance whether you dine in, on the roof patio, or in the garden.  We did have issue with a steak one time---very gristle-y---within moments, the server and manager teamed up to take care of the problem with charm and grace.  The mushroom soup is to die for---keep your fingers crossed it's on offer when you dine there,  Thursday night, we had the sushi nachos---I had to fight DH (who SWEARS he hates sushi) for my fair share.  After our Asian moment, we decide to go Mexican that night---DH got the chicken carnitas.  Server recommended the masa taco shell.  Masa---isn't that the soft corn stuff they wrap around tamales?  Somehow CS makes it works, deep frying it to this incredible crunchy, moist container for delicious roasted meats and veggies.  My veggie chile relleno...well...  We have lived in AZ for almost 5 months now and I have only found one great relleno (a little taco shop off I-17 in Camp Verde called Gabriellas).  I admit I was torn between the duck tacos with mango-habanero sauce and the chile relleno, but oh, how I wanted one (miss you Sammy's El Pueblo!) and I mean, we are talking about Carefree Station...how could it go wrong?  It did.  Talk about a chef going one step too far.  I can't argue about the stuffing---cheesy, corny, beany----yum!---but the pepper was---yuck!  It tasted like it was pickled.  I offered DH a bite without commenting---his first words after the taste was: "tastes like Peter Piper's Pickled Peppers---what the h***?"  And then instead of the usual beans and rice accompaniments---whole wheat spaghetti?  (And no, the menu was NOT clear about what to expect!)  After the many fab meals we have had at CS and the to-die-for sushi nachos---what a let down.  Sometimes, chefs need to say no, I will not screw with a classic.  On the other hand, if this is the only time Carefree Station done me wrong, I got no complaints and---as ever---we'll be back.  Keep those sushi nachos cold for me!

Went down to CS for dinner tonight (Sat 9/28) and it was dark and locked up.  No signs noting they are on holiday and when called, got a vm saying mailbox is full!  Google no help.  Anyone know what's going on????

Local rumor is that landlord vs tenant dispute is what caused Carefree Station to close.  However, owners of CS had recently signed a lease on another venue down in Scottsdale (they would have been opening their 3rd establishment, Scottsdale Station), and those plans are still on.  So I guess we'll just have to wait for them to open the new place (hurry!) or head on over to Prescott Station.

We'd always heard Giordano's was expensive, but when we checked it out online, looked reasonable to us and we were craving Ital on a Saturday night.  Got there about 6 pm and just a few tables occupied.  Were seated promptly.  Kind of a traditional, Italian restaurant ambiance---nice art from local artists on walls---noted everything was VERY CLEAN!  We took our time looking over the menu and our server, Adele, was accomodating to our leisurely pace.  I ended up going with the night's special, a broiled pork chop with a slice of eggplant, prosciutto, and lots of cheese over spaghetti with a side of zucchini.  DH, of course, got the chicken parm. House salads.  Nice selection of wine by the glass, reasonably priced.  Were brought a basket of bread and a bowl of herbed butter.  Butter delicious, bread sucked.  So I just slathered it with the butter.  Salads arrived---very fresh and crisp with tasty Italian dressing, accompanied by a bruschetta topped piece of toast.  We took one bite of the bruschetta and OMG!!!!  Seriously BEST BITE EVER!  Even though we had started our meal, we immediately beckoned Adele over and ordered a plate of bruschetta---we wanted MORE!  We devoured the salads and the bruschetta just in time as our meals arrived.  DH grew up in Cleveland and lived in NY/NJ, so he is (he says) the Italian Expert.  I like Italian okay.  But let me tell you, this was some of the best Italian food I ever had and definitely the best in AZ.  And I am a skeptic about Italian food.  As DH said, it was like we were in a restaurant in Little Italy!  He was so happy!   Every bite was fab.  And mine was cooked exactly as I requested: "Please, PLEASE don't overcook the pork chop and please, PLEASE overcook the pasta!"  (I don't like al dente.)  It was perfect.  Melt in your mouth tender in every way and a party of flavors.  My bite of DH's was very good, although one bite was all he would share.  When Adele came to check on us, we told her how wonderful everything was and she beamed: turns out she is also the owner!  From New York City!  But of course!  We didn't want the meal to end, it was so good, so we did the rare thing and ordered a dessert to share.  Cannoli.  Wonderful.  It tasted like we had stopped into a bakery on Mulberry Street. When we left about 8.30, I was not surprised that the restaurant was almost full of happy diners---I am surprised folks are not standing outside the door to get in.  If you like Italian, do yourself a favor and try this place.  Pleasant ambiance, excellent service, delicious food of high quality and large quantity.  My only caveat---don't go for the bread. Only disappointment in the meal and I don't get that.  And if you are sensitive to salt, ask the kitchen to lighten up.  Everything was just on the edge of too salty for DH and me---didn't fall over the precipice, though we could see it, but the flavors and the experience was so good, for certain we'll be back, and as we are sure everything is made to order, I don't think asking them to back-off on the salt will be a big deal.  However---it might be perfect for 90% of people---DH and I are just funny about salt.  Anyhow, it was great and we recommend and are looking forward to returning.

The first time DH and I crossed the threshold of The Capital Grille, it was the hottest day of the summer and we had been hitting the shops at the Promenade and we were very casually dressed and hot and sweaty---ick!  The pretty blonde hostess at the door didn't turn a hair but greeted us as warmly as if we had entered wearing furs and diamonds (not in this weather!)  But after we checked out the lush, dignified atmosphere and sumptuous menu, DH and I decided this wasn't someplace to grab a quick bite (our plan) so we decided to return when we were comfortable in our skins and clothes and had time to linger.  So last Saturday we returned, at the suggestion of one of our Meet-up group members, to try the Generous Pour.  It was a month-long event being put on by the Grille where for $25 you got to sample 7 wines, whites and reds.  It was so late by the time we arrived, we decided not to go for a heavy meal and stick to appys.  Great decision.    I can't say enough good things about TCG.  Greeted again by that nice young hostess, sat in a lightly populated bar and had the very best time!  Our bartender, Matt, was wonderful----very attentive. very knowledgeable about the wines and willing to share all that he knew, and when we stumped him with a question, he brought over Jamie.  I never caught what's Jamie's role is (sommelier?), but again, very wine-telligent and personable and charming.  The staff at TCG just made it a wonderful experience.  We liked some of the wines, didn't like some, but in every case, Matt and/or Jamie were able to tell us so much about the grapes and the winemaking process and the wineries.    Our apps were good too!  We ordered the pan-fried calamari with cherry peppers and the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella---they came out quickly, hot and delicious.    It was just a super experience, we had such a good time (almost 3 hours!) and we can't wait to to go back---not only to finally try the dinner menu (I salivate looking at it, but steak after 8 pm is not conducive to a good night's sleep)---but Matt gave us a tiny sip from this large glass decanter on the barback.  Apparently, they fill it with slices of  pineapple and then add Stoli and let it all marinate and the beverage that comes out of that spout is very cold, slightly sweet and slightly acidic and I MUST have an entire frosty glass (or two) of it while the weather is hot, because I know that will be nirvana.  Plus there are so many items on the menu I want to try---starters like the Waygu carpaccio and the lobster and crab cakes, then entrees like the Kona crusted sirloin, the Chilean sea bass, the porcini rubbed Delmonico, the seared tuna, the filet mignon, the...the...the whole menu!  Oh my gosh, it's seven in the morning and I am craving steak!  We can't wait to return!

We love taking out-of-town guests to El Encanto for the "experience".  Charming, funky Mexican patio feel (complete with a pond filled with duck, geese and turtles), in general the staff is great (we have had one or two surly servers in the past, but we never see them again, so evidently management takes care of this) a mariachi band or guitarist strolling amongst the tables (my only issue with that is what's the etiquette?  Should we stop eating and look attentive when they stand at our tableside and play?  Do we tip?)  And the food is GOOD!  I love the three sauces that they bring to the table with chips---just pour those into a soup bowl and give me a spoon.  Chips are typical Mex restaurant fare---a little greasy and tasteless---probably out of a box from Chicago.  We haven't had a unenjoyable meal there yet, although I wish they served a vegetarian version of a chile relleno---why do people insist on ruining cheesy goodness with meat?  But maybe I just need to ask.  DH loves the Pollo Fundido and the Carne Asada.  I am also a fan of the Enchilada de Pollo con Mole.  It's fun casual, and come hungry!

Not a pizza person.  NOT-A-PIZZA-PERSON.  But our dining couple friends had heard good things about LGO and wanted to try it and I figured, okay, there will be something other than pizza...  Well, there really wasn't anything else that tickled my fancy, so I ended up ordering a pie.  All I can say is: wow!  Well, actually, first of all, we started off with salads.  One couple split a Caesar and the other a Caprese.  Fresh, delicious, yum!  THEN came the pies.  One set of us ordered a Margherita, the other a Margherita and a Gladiator, and the third couple a Gladiator and a Mother Earth.  Can I just say all pies were devoured?    I got the Mother Earth, which was loaded with green & black olives, artichokes, roasted peppers, broccolini, mushrooms, tomatoes, fennel, and onion.  The crust was very crispy and very thin---practically non-existent, just as I requested. Uctuous cheese was high quality.  Veggies just right.  But seriously, I traded off a slice for one of the Margherita, and that's what I would order next time.  Just cheese, tomatoes and fresh basil.  Pure, simple goodness.  I had a bite of DH's Gladiator---it was okay---I think I am maybe not a meat-lover-pizza person.  I was DD, so I had ice tea.  It wa a bit odd tasting.  On reflection, maybe it has a hint of orange-y flavor (La Grande ORANGE, after all)?  It was okay after I got used to the taste.  But I would like to have been warned.  First taste, I was like: Eeeew...Phoenix city water flavor?  Then I realized it was kind of a fruit-taste.  Except for never offering me a re-fill on my ice tea, our server, Madison was very good---attentive, personable, informative, and she's the one who made sure I got my practically crustless pizza!  Cute hair-cut too!  All our food came out fast and hot, except for the salads, which were cold and crisp!  Anyhow, I can see why LGO has 4.5 stars.  Very good.  If I were to trek south for pizza again---and I think that may happen, because everyone was so happy with their meals---I would probably do it for LGO.

I'm grateful we were given a $50 gift card for Maggiano's.  Because I'm still kind of  ticked off that even with that, we ended up paying an additional $80+ for a meal that was lacking by most standards in quality and service.  First, when walking from the parking lot to the front door, we were assailed by a horrendous sewage smell.  Lovely on a hot Phoenix night.  I assume not the restaurant's fault, but it set the tone.  It went from s**t to s**ttier.  Entered the restaurant and were dead-eyed by two hostesses.  Or Zombies.  I'm not sure.  After a few moments of staring each other down, one asked us if she could help us.  (No, we just dropped in to say hi.)  So we ask for a table and she says it will be about 10 minutes.  Really?  With the dining room half empty?  Should have turned and left then, but that gift card was burning a hole in DH's pocket.  So in less than 10 minutes (about seven), her partner-in-rigor leads us to a table, pushes some menus at us, and vanishes.  Thank goodness.  (Zombies are carnivores, right?)  Our server appeared pretty quickly.  We'd already looked at the menu and wine list and we ordered a plate of Bruschetta  to share and a couple of glasses of wine.   He returns in a decent amount of time with the wine, but manages to slop about a third of  DH's glass on the table.  He apologized mightily and swabbed the tabletop with DH's napkin, which he snatched up.  Still, at $11 a glass, it would have been nice if he'd offered to top off the glass.  It seemed like a long time, but about ten minutes later, the Bruschetta arrived.  What can I say---it was okay.  It was boring.  Nothing memorable about it, except it was pretty juicy. The toast got soggy fast.  I make this point because about mid-way, DH said plaintively, "I wish I had a napkin."  Our waiter had never replaced the one used to mop up the wine.  However, I am a good wife and I let him use a corner of mine to tidy up with.  At the time of the appy delivery, we had ordered our meals.  DH and I each ordered a chopped salad and DS and DSGF ordered a caesar's salad.  Then DH ordered as his entree the Rigatoni "D" and I ordered the Lobster Carbonera and the kids each got a chicken Marsala.    So we eat our salads, which were...mediocre.   The greens weren't particularly fresh, the olives, red onions and pepperoncini barely made a cameo, the dressing was thin and tasteless and was served on the salad when we had specified on the side.    So our server came back and collected the plates---the kids had eaten up, DH did about 75% and I ate about half, because why waste room with a tired salad when I had Lobster Carbonera---oh what images that brought to mind!---coming for dinner!  Now each setting is set with two forks, and DH had used one for the bruschetta and one for his salad, so our server carried both away (but still no napkin, although he was like, "oh, yeah!" when we reminded him.)  Then we sat...and sat...and sat...and sat...and FINALLY our entrees came out.  (Yay!)  But no additonal fork or a napkin for DH.  We didn't think to tell the food runner so we were sitting there while the food cooled waiting for our server to check back in.  Which he did...eventually.  And was very apologetic.  And whisked off.  And finally...FINALLY...my husband has all the necessary dining equipment again.  My Lobster Carbonera was a huge let-down.  What kind of images pop into your mind at this description:  spaghetti, lobster, smoked bacon, snap peas and garlic cream sauce?  How could you screw that up?  And yet...  Don't get me wrong, the amount of lobster was generous, the color of the snap peas was bright---so how did they manage to wring every bit of flavor out of it so it was one forkful after another of...nothing?  DH said said his Rigatoni was "okay", then wouldn't say much more.  I think because he was disappointed.  He had been so looking forward to a good Italian meal.  The kids gobbled up their chicken Marsala, but they are 18 and college students and would  eat shoe leather if it were free.    I felt like this was basically a one star meal when our server drifted back to say howdy, collect plates, and suggested dessert.  And I was hungry and annoyed and I looked at the dessert menu and thought what the heck. So I ordered the poundcake with the vanilla ice cream and puddle of hot fudge sauce and caramelized bananas.  And that's why this review is two stars instead of one.  Because that was delicious.  I mean, I'll never set foot in Maggiano's again, but I will always remember that dessert fondly and when I get the time, I am going to make it myself, and then I can have all the caramelized bananas I want to slosh around in decadent hot fudge sauce.  So, just to finish the night off, DH stood up and there, on the back of his light khaki shorts, was a huge tomato stain.  Evidently there had been something on the seat.  So I've washed the shorts twice and it's fading---I am staying optimistic....  Something to remember Maggiano's by...

This was our second visit to Deseo.  Our first was on Valentine's Day, where a fixed price dinner meant we could not use our Localdines coupon, but we didn't care.  It was an incredible meal with outstanding service and we couldn't wait to go back.  The meal we enjoyed Saturday night was not quite as exceptional, but it was very, very good nonetheless.  The service was still excellent and the Rainbow ceviche is to die for  (And DH HATES fish, so to see him devour ceviche is like this amazing moment!)----we only wish it came with a spoon, so we could have scooped up more of the delicious citrus-y juice that accompanied the ceviche. Instead, we sopped it up as best we could with the delicious yucca flour rolls.  That was the only "low-point" in the service---we asked for extra rolls and the server was disgruntled and almost tossed the rolls on our plates.  And those yucca flour rolls are so exceptionally, incredibly good.  If I knew where to get yucca flour, I swear I would try to make them at home, if I was any sort of baker.  Just beyond delicious!  So don't be stingy!   We started with the Rainbow Ceviche, which I think has Ahi and Calamari and Salmon with a touch of jalapeno and a sprinkle of black and white sesame seeds, so it is as beautiful as it tastes.  DH ordered the Kobe Vaca Encebollada, which was a grilled skirt steak and I ordered the Yuca-Wrapped Dorado al Ajillo.  The plates that arrived swiftly to our table were beautifully presented----I really do believe you eat with your eyes as much as your mouth.  They totally had eye-appeal.    DH said the flavor of his meal was wonderful, but he hated the quality of the steak---he discarded quite a lot it as too chewy and fatty.  He said the flavors were so wonderful though, and he thought it was just the nature of the cut of meat, and that next time if he ordered beef he would go with the tenderloin or else try the pork or chicken. The potatoes were so delicious, he wished for a larger portion.  My fish dish was incredibly tasty, beautifully browned to a crisp finish, albeit the tiniest bit overcooked.  And I have had gloriously browned fish that was perfectly moist and tender, so I just think it was a tiny misstep by the kitchen. The amaranth that came with it was so unusual and delicious---I can't even describe it except---yum!  I wanted more than the soup spoon (it literally came on a soup spoon!) quantity they gave you.  There were tiny flaws in execution, but overall flavor and presentation was wonderful, so I have to give it four stars because we are totally fans and totally going to be back.  We didn't order desert but the after-dinner coffee rocked though---wow!  I was bright and bushy-tailed after one cup despite a big meal and several glasses of wine!  We don't care for the South American wines too much, but it is a South American-themed restaurant, so it is what it is, and after a couple of glasses, who cares?  Our server Jason was very good---attentive without stalking. The service at Deseo is top-notch.  If it hadn't been for the bread guy being kind of surly when we asked for a bit more bread---oh, and then when we were trying to get every bit of the delicious ceviche juice (is that what it is called?) he kept trying to take the dish from us, even while we were dunking our bread bits into the sauce!  Go away!  (Actually, it's a good thing he did eventually carry the dish off, or we may ended up just drinking the juice from the plate---yes---that good!)  All in all, another very lovely experience and we will totally return every month or so, just for the ceviche!  Actually, DH---the man who HATES fish---said he wouldn't mind just coming in for a dinner of ceviche and yucca rolls!  (Who are you and what have you done with my real husband?)  I felt the prices very reasonable---actually, less than an Italian restaurant (disappointing!) we went to last night and a million times better in all aspects---taste, service, and ambiance.  And the Kierland Westin is a gorgeous resort---take time to stroll through and admire some fabulous art!

Attended my first Sushi-licious Meet-up group gathering here---so glad to be introduced to a nice Sushi place close to home.  I had the Spicy Tuna Roll and the Sunset Roll.  Very attractive, refined presentation and fish was fresh.  There were about twelve people in our group and I didn't hear a single person saying anything even a little negative about their meals, and with twelve sushi-aficianadoes, if it wasn't right, you would have heard.  One of the diners in our group ordered the Flaming Dragon---what a hoot!  A flaming plate of sushi---you had to be there!  Service was very good by the two servers assigned our group, who deftly dealt with a lot of comments and questions and separate checks.  One of our diners requested a special order of deep fried salmon skin, and they made it happen for her and she was happy!  They also sent us over a complimentary dish to share by the group and the owner came over to personally make sure we were happy with our meals and to thank us for coming.   It was a very nice experience.  I am happy to recommend and I will happily return.

I'm not a pizza person.  DH is, however, and since we just moved to the area and DH lost his "pizza buddies", I've been elected.  But as you can imagine, I approach a pizza parlor with a lack of enthusiasm.  In fact, I worked a deal with DH: for every pizza meal I have with him, he has to go for sushi or Mexican with me!  So we've tried several pizza joints around the Northern Scottsdale area with varying levels of success.  DH---grew up in Cleveland and spent over a decade in NJ---considers himself a pizza connoisseur.  I just want something I like.  (There was one place back in Ohio that made a Bruschetta pizza that left me speechless with delight, but that was another life...)  Anyhow, we read the reviews of #1 Brother's Pizza and decided to check it out late one Sunday night.  There were a handful of folks in the brightly lit, VERY CLEAN restaurant when we arrived.  As I said, it was later.  The young lady who waited on us was just Nice with a capital "N".  Big plus!  (DH stopped in at one Carefree pizza place on Super Bowl night for a carry-out and the guy wouldn't make him a pizza because he was watching the game---really!)  After some discussion, we decide to order one of the large house salads and a vegetarian pizza.  One of my dislikes of pizza is I don't love tomato sauce, so we asked if they could manage to do regular sauce on half the pizza and light on the other half, and the young lady said it would happen.    We sat down and within minutes, our salad arrived.  Nothing imaginative, but all the veggies were incredibly fresh and crisp and cool without being cold.  DH had ordered blue cheese dressing to make me happy (my fave), but the server brought us also a bottle of their housemade Italian to try.  So glad she did.  It was very good---a bit sweet for me, but DH loved it.  The salad even had pepperoncini in it---that perk of acid and bite is always nice.  Our pizza showed up shortly, and frankly, I liked it.  First of all, the Nice Girl placed it carefully before us and pointed out which side was light and which was regular sauce (plus!).  The veggies were all nice and fresh, cooked but still with some "tooth" to them.  The mozzarella cheese was obviously whole milk and all hot, oozzey, chewy goodness.  To me, the crust is just a way to get the toppings to my mouth, but I liked that it was thin and crispy but not like a cracker.  DH, in between inhaling bites, declared: I feel like I am in Times Square.  (That's good.)  Oh---and there were condiments on the table----garlic and Italian seasoning and garlic powder---another big plus!  (I guess they do that in NJ too.)  So, the pizza gets gobbled, we are very pleased, and then to make our experience even nicer, this older gentleman with a European accent (Italian, Greek?) comes out and sincerely inquires if we are happy with our pizza, did he get the sauce ratio right, and if no, he'll do better next time---this guy CARED!  In fact, that was the overall impression we got---Nice Girl also kept checking in with us,---it mattered to her that we were enjoying our meal.  When we got in the car, DH wanted to know when our next pizza night was and you know what?  I told him if was #1 Brother's Pizza, I'd come back as soon as a week.  And from a pizza non-lover, that's the biggest compliment I can offer.  Another successful pizza experience, and Brother's may end up converting me!  DH thanks you!

Re-visited Brother's Pizza Sunday night.  Got there very near closing.  They were as warm and friendly as before.  DH got a pepperoni pizza and I tried the Eggplant dinner.  Same fresh, crisp, unimaginative salad with house Italian dressing.  Eggplant was good----generous slices of eggplat properly fried, but a bit soggy after having been baked in sauce.  If I knew them better, I would tell them that they should reheat eggplant and sauce separately---eggplant on grill or salamander---then put together for serving.  That's how you keep the crispy fried goodness.  Maybe I can tell them in a year or so, lol!  The mozarella they use is soooo good!  But all in all, it was another really tasty meal---I actually ate a slice of DH's pizza!    And bless their hearts---I bet we walked in just as they were closing, because the minute we walked out, the lights went off----they didn't even clear our table!  Yet they never once made us feel like an inconvenience.  Sorry guys!  We'll try to come earlier next time!  :)

I called Suzanne Lasky at S Interior Design because although I felt like I had a good foundation going, I just couldn't get my Great Room and Dining Room finished off.  Suzanne definitely brought the frosting to the cake.  Before she came, she had me complete a questionnaire and send her a link to my Houzz album so she already had a sense of my style and where I was going, so our first meeting was not spent on a lot of preliminary "getting to know you"---we got right down to it!  First of all, she is a lovely, down-to-earth person---a pleasure to work with.  Secondly, she GOT what I was wanting for our home and really ran with it, offering ideas and refining my plans so things started falling into a cohesive whole.  She was so enthusiastic and filled with creative thoughts she totally re-energized me!  And she understood that I am all about unexpected bargain finds (I don't want the commitment of expensive furniture and accessories---what if I want to go in a totally different direction in a year?) and she was NOT snooty or condescending that some of my favorite finds are from Ikea.  In fact, she made suggestions of other great "bargain-hunting" spots for art and rugs.  This is not to say she doesn't do high-end---you should see the portfolio of homes she has worked with and she had a great article in Phoenix magazine (how I found her).   But she's flexible and all about what the client wants.  I loved how she played and elaborated with my needs and ideas, so I feel like that even with her assistance, it's still all my house and the design is me.  And finally, she is totally pet-friendly, so not only did provide a lot of helpful critiques and ideas on design, she also gave me some great tips on training our new puppy---who danced around her feet nearly the whole visit.  I can't wait to have Suzanne back out to see what I have accomplished based on her advice and keep moving forward.  After two years, this project is going to get done!

Made reservation for a Friday at 5.45.  Arrived on time and our table was ready.  Good thing we had res---place was PACKED with Happy Hour people!!!!  Waitress dropped by table to say she would be "right with us" about four times, but we did not give our drink and appy orders until about 6.10.  Happily, waitress said she'd make sure we got the HH pricing.  It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks, another 15 for food.  We almost got irritated enough to bail, but then were convinced to stay---thank goodness we did.  As HH crowd cleared, service improved IMMENSELY. And food---quality and quantities rocked!  DS and I each started with avocado and ahi poke ($7).  HUGE portions.  Six poke laden chips on a narrow 12 inch platter...we could easily have shared, but son and I each managed to dispose of our share.  DH got the tempura fried shrimp ($4).  Five 4-5 inch shrimp perfectly encrusted in a light, crisp tempura with a yummy dipping sauce.  The four of us all had the miso soup, which was okay, but I like Yume's better.  Personal taste.  For entree, DH got the chicken teriyaki, which he said was "f'ing-tastic".  (Language!)  DS got the creamy baked lobster roll, spicy tuna roll, and fire dragon roll.  DSG got two vegetable rolls.  I got the sashimi platter with 5 different fish.  Huge quantities, everything so fresh and delicious and beautifully presented.  As I said, our service was much improved once HH crowd dispersed.  Ambiance was hipster and VERY loud.  Wish we had dined on the patio, which seemed quieter.  DH and I can't return.  I want to try the citrus-basil martini with the ahi poke while sitting on the patio on a quiet Sunday afternoon.  I just know that would be great!

We had an exceptionally nice visit to the ruins at Casa Grande National Monument.  Great weather, mellow crowd (but not too crowded) and a fascinating site!  You can see the ruins as you approach on 87---you are cruising along on this flat desert landscape ringed with far off mountains when you see what almost looks like a pagoda like roof---and there, sheltered beneath, are the ruins.  It's very surreal, "Star War-ish", if you know what I mean.  We were able to use our National Park Pass for entry to the Visitor's Center/Museum and it's dog-friendly.  BIG PLUS!  Well, some dog friendly---they ask that you carry your dogs on the carpeted portions of the museum, but fortunately, our girls are portable, so we just tucked them under our arms.  The exhibits themselves are very well laid out and explained.  I was especially impressed by two LARGE Hohokam ollas that were excavated intact.  How could they stay unbroken for a thousand years before coming to light again?  Amazing!  I also enjoyed a sign that explained the Hohokam's timeline in comparison to other civilizations---the Americas and Rome.  They had a really nice children's area where kids could touch and see items safely.  There is also a brief film and an hourly guided tour, but because we had our fur-babies, we didn't think it was fair to the other visitors to bring in that distraction, so we did not partake.  Once you exit the museum, you head out to the ruins.  It was quite a huge compound, with the four story building rising majestically from the desert.  There are wonderful interpretive signs placed all around that tell you about the construction of the compound, the lifestyle of it's occupants, their agriculture, artisans...  Very interesting.  And they just disappear about 1450 AD.  Signs putting forward some theories on that as well.  We were there about 2 hours, and will be returning sans pups so we can enjoy the movie and guided tour.  We ended our visit with a picnic under some pleasant shelters across the parking lot.  The monument is VERY well maintained and clean!  (Including the bathrooms!)    Note: As we left the museum to tour the ruins, the guided tour was gathering.  A park ranger---I didn't get his name but he had thick silvery hair and beard--led a little girl before the assembled visitors and proceeded to swear her in as a junior ranger.  He was so patient and warm and sweet about it and she was cute and shy and Mom and Dad were so proud and clicking away with the camera and everyone gave a round of applause when Sr Ranger and Jr Ranger posed at the end with a handshake and her certificate.  It was a nice moment to witness!

Our meal here was one of those times when we wished we could have eaten ten times the amount of food.  Our dishes---DH got the Enchantment platter and I got the Spooning Rellenos---were---to be extravagant---sublime!  But let's start with the chips and bowl of salsa that were immediately brought to our table when we were seated.  Is it salsa?  I don't think by the definition---to my thinking, it was more like a puree of delicious, fire-roasted Hatch chilies!  Oh, yum!  The chips were nothing special, but who cared with that tasty green goodness!  We each ordered a glass of wine---reasonably priced.  Then came our entrees, which---as I said earlier---were delicious!  My spooning rellenos were breaded and fried peppers filled with juicy, tender beef, chorizo, and jack and cheddar cheese.  Oh, my!  Accompanied by some delicious pinto beans---not heavily seasoned, but their simpleness were the perfect foil to all the flavors on my plate.  There was also seasoned rice, which I did not eat.  Not a fan of rice---should have traded for extra beans!  DH's platter had  a beautiful and delicious filet---quite large for the well-priced plate---and perfectly cooked to his requested medium rare.  The accompanying shrimp were tasty and again, grilled to perfection.  The chicken enchilada was delicious and the chile potato---oh, wow!  It was half a chile with the innards cleaned out, then potatoes pureed with chiles and carefully piped back into the "shell".  Pretty to look at, tasty to the mouth.  Of course, we had no room for dessert.  In fact, we had enough to bring home, which was great, because all in all, Blue Adobe Grill is almost an hour from our house, so sadly, this is going to be a "special" restaurant.  But we will be back.  Not only did so many dishes sound delicious on the menu, but when carried out to our fellow diners, we were annoying rubberneckers as they went by!    I surely hope we find another reason to be down Mesa way!  My edit---I forgot to mention the chile-corn chowder.  TO. DIE. FOR.  I would like to have carried home containers of both the "salsa" and chowder home.  I have since learned Blue Adobe has second location closer to us, in Scottsdale.  Can't wait to try---hope it will live up to the original!

Ambiance very pleasant for dining on a beautiful patio on the first pleasant evening of the fall.  There was a little noise by happy tourists from the nearby pool which did not disturb us.  Our food very good---I had the Restaurant Week menu and DH ordered off the standard menu.  I started with a salad of heirloom tomatoes with burrata and preserved lemon that was the best caprese salad ever---and I absolutely loved my monkfish saltimboca and herbed polenta.  The almond cake with chocolate mousse was very tasty, but not extraordinary, although the coffee knocked my socks off!  DH had the chicken saltimbocca, risotto, and warm tomato salad.   DH's risotto was absolutely perfect and the tomato salad was an interesting side dish, the little roasted tomatoes miniature flavor bombs, but DH thought his chicken saltimbocca was a little dry.  Our server overheard and offered to bring him something else, but DH said no and ate 75% of his entree.  And yet they still took it off our bill.  We hadn't asked for this, he ate the dish after-all, but we were told if he wasn't absolutely satisfied with his meal, then they wanted to comp it.  We were impressed by this commitment to customer service!  This is what a multi-star resort is all about.   And actually, what made our experience outstanding and Alto a "return restaurant" was the exceptional service we received from Jay.  He was warm, professional, attentive---it felt like we were valued guests in his home.  Dining establishments should never underestimate the affect the level of service has on the overall experience.  Jay left us with satisfied smiles.  And I need to mention Jenna, who assisted Jay and was a lovely young woman, and even the manager who stopped by our table to say hello was a very polished and courteous gentleman.  Oh---one more person---the young man bartending at the SWB who served us wine while we waited for Alto to open (early reservation)---another excellent representative of the Hyatt Corporation.    I happily recommend Alto to residents and travelers alike.  I do not think you will be dissatisfied.

DH was getting pizza at #1 Brothers---I didn't feel like Italian, but sushi.  Since Electric Eel is in the same plaza, I thought it would be just easier to order take-out from them.  Friday night I called three times, and the last two times let the phone ring at least 10 times.  No answer.  Out of business?  Ended up ordering from dear old fave down the road.  But when DH went to pick up his pizza, he said Electric Eel was open.  So I don't know what food is like, but as far as customer service goes: FAIL.  I won't bother trying again when I can drive another 1/2 mile south and feel appreciated and get good sushi.

So we've become pretty much frequent flyers at Heart & Soul, but it had been a little while and then I realized I had a Groupon that was expiring 2/16, so we stopped in for dinner on Tuesday night.  Greeted and seated by a super nice guy who ended up being our server---I never caught his name---but he was A+!  Personable, professional, well-informed on the food...  Started (as always) with the Fried Green Tomato appetizers.  They rock my world, they are so good.  Super hot and fried perfectly---crisp and never greasy---with the green tomato adding a bright note.  Generous serving.  No frou-frou portions at H&S!  Comes with a side of Chipotle-mayo that adds the perfect amount of heat.  I was tempted by the Lemon Tilapia---I could hear a lady a few tables over exclaiming how good her's was----but then I fell in with DH and ordered the Blue Cheese sirloin.  I got mine with the housemade mashed taters and DH got the baked.  Sirloin can be iffy---this was not.  Cooked perfectly to order, trimmed so just the tastiest bit of fat remained, tender but with some chew and full of flavor...  Dressed with just the right amount of blue cheese sauce.  I had remarked in a previous review that the mashed potatoes are good but a bit dry---these were beautiful in texture and served with two generous pats of butter spilling lovely, butter-y goodness over the snowy folds of potato perfection.  DH's baked potato was a baked potato, except someone with flair had cut it with a cool little zig-zag rather than a straight slit---we admired that artistic touch!  Oh, and to accompany---grilled yellow squash and zucchini.  DH is a pro at grilling these two veggies---our faves!---and these were very well done---hot and crisp-tender and well-seasoned.  Maybe we would have liked just a touch of char, but we are used to them being done on a grill.  Our server said it was Romero in the kitchen---thank you, Romero.  Great job!  We were STUFFED at the end, but our very good server convinced us to take home some peach cobbler for afters.  This is where there was a slight falter.  Both DH and I have southern roots (WV and NC) and we know our cobbler.  This was a little too cakey---a cobbler should raise up and embrace the fruit.  But the peaches were very good, with a nice bite and not too sweet.  Yummy ice cream, too!  Cakey or not, we ate it!  Okay, H&S doesn't have the ambiance of Cafe Bink or maybe the self-conscious "foodie" attitude, but comparing them on service and quality of execution----and reasonable menu prices----I don't understand why Heart and Soul doesn't have the SRO crowd every night  that Binks gets.  It looks like a diner, but it's comfort food at a higher level.

Another fabulous breakfast.  Too fabulous.  We were going to go hiking at Spur Cross and we ended up auto-hiking thru Tonto.  We were too fat and lazy to walk after inhaling massive, delicious portions of food.

I only have three words to say: to-die-for.  Wednesday nights: all you can eat Buttermilk Fried Chicken, homemade gravy and mashed taters and sauteed veggies.  Would have loved to finish up with the Peach Cobbler but one plate of delectable chicken and we could hardly walk.  Never have had a bad service there.  The decor is still kind of weird.  Cowboys and red convertibles.  Guess there's a country song in there somewhere!

What's going on with H&S?  Last two visits just not up to par!  Service great---as usual, but food--meh!  Saturday night DH and I took 5 out-of-town guests for dinner there, promising them a great meal.  Not so much.  Of course, the fried green tomatoes, (which they have or don't, depending on tomato availability) were sublime as usual.  We gobbled up two servings!  Salads were fresh and crisp and delicious---but the entrees were such a disappointment!  My lemon tilapia was very fishy tasting, unseasoned, with a hardly any detectable sauce to moisten it.  DH said his burger okay, but not memorable,  One of our party ordered the prime rib special and proclaimed it outstanding.  (I love prime rib and would have normally ordered it, but the one time I ordered it at H&S, the rub was so salty we had to return our meals and I didn't want to chance it)  Two of our party ordered the sirloin with gorgonzola sauce....one proclaimed their's was excellent---the other was served a sauce drizzled piece of gristle that had to be returned----and as accomodating as our server was, it took forever to get the replacement meal and the rest of us had finished our meals before it arrived.  He ended up carrying it off as take-away.  The fifth member of our group ordered the mahi-mahi and he said it was dry and tasteless and the small amount of pineapple salsa wasn't enough to off-set that.  He detected no BBQ seasoning.  The seventh diner ordered the Pasta ala Chicken and he loved it---and when we all tasted it, we all agreed it was very good.   But that's a less than 50% satisfaction rate---and embarrassing when we had boasted how excellent H&S is!  However, again---service was very good, especially a young man in a Cave Creek t-shirt who was assisting our server---he was attentive and charming and ever-so personable and a real keeper for Heart and Soul.  Guys---get it together in the kitchen!  You are breaking our hearts!

I am very happy with the service from Priceless Plumbing.  We have had two different techs come out and both have been very thoughtful---thoughtful not only in manner, but in thinking out the issue and trying to come up with solutions.  I appreciate these guys are not knee-jerk repairmen!  I don't remember the name of the first guy, but the last two times it was Israel.  Can't say enough good things about him.  Again, very thoughtful, pro-active, polite, and kind enough to explain everything he was doing in simplistic terms a layman can understand.  Also, the PP guys are always on time and always wear shoe protectors.  They clean up after themselves---you can't even tell they were at your house!  The girls in the office, Heather and Cara, are always very nice and a pleasure to speak with.

We had attended a Meet-Up winelovers  tasting event here a few weeks ago, but I am reviewing based on our first one-on-one experience, which is when we realized the Groupon that we had purchased 6 months ago was expiring that very day!!!  So we hustled over to Cellar 13, arriving about 6.30 pm.  The basement lounge, where our Meet-up Group hung out the first visit, was evidently full up, so we ended up sitting at the bar.  We were served by this really nice young woman---blonde, English accent, a great combo of friendliness and professionalism.  Very knowledgeable about what she was serving.  AND she was hustling her butt off!  She was behind the bar then out on the patio, then down the stairs, then here...there there...I got exhausted just watching her and had to drink an extra glass of wine!  They were offering a special of a chicken cordon bleu sandwich.  DH ordered that, and it turns out he got the last one!  I guess they had had two other specials and they were already gone---that's how good the food is!  I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with the sundried tomatoes and arugula---as opposed to the grilled cheese sandwich with four kinds of cheese.  It was a tough decision!  It was delicious---the bread was amazing, the cheese gooey and full-bodied...  Anyhow, we can't wait to go back.  Great ambiance, great food, great service, and every wine we sampled was...great!

It was a little cool Wednesday night, but we had the pup so needed a pet-friendly venue and that was Earl's!  As usual, the girls at the counter were super nice as they took our order, reminding us there were pans outside for our little Pupperoni to eat and drink from. For some reason, "Big Kahuna" anything sounded good, so DH got the Big Kahuna Chicken sandwich and I got the Big Kahuna Burger.  So basically, same thing---different meats.  A generous portion of protein, with grilled pineapple, onions and lettuce (not grilled!) and this delicious teriyaki mayo.  No cheese, I don't think, but it was so good, you didn't notice.  We shared and both agreed we liked the burger the best---it's supposed to be the best Angus beef.  And we got fries, and they were excellent!  Hot and crispy!  I had iced tea and DH got this adorable little mini-bottle of wine.  Have never had, but I have friends who SWEAR the "adult milkshakes" are a must-try.  And the playlist was super---we meant to ask if it was their own mix or Pandora.  It ain't fancy but's it's hipster-kitschy and it's a great people-watching point, particularly during the day or during one of Cave Creek's town parties, like Wicked or Wild West Days or Fiesta Days.  And yes, the "dining room" is tiny---but except for the most inclement days, why would you want to eat inside anyways?  All in all, was a pleasant almost-hour, idling on the patio with a tasty casual dinner, listening to some tunes and hanging out with my two honeys.

DH has been wanting to eat at Uncle Louie's for ages and we finally got there.  We may always be there!  Hands down, we think this was probably the best Italian food either of us have had since we were in Priaiano on the Amalfi Coast and we became addicted to a family-owned restaurant called La Strada.  It's not a big place, but the booths and tables are set comfortably spaced and the ambiance is warm and cozy.  DH and I had to wait about 20 minutes for a table at 7 pm on Saturday night----the dining room and bar were full of happy eaters!  The smells were out of this world and we just got hungrier!  We got seated and within moments, Uncle Louie himself came to take our drinks order since the servers were super busy.  I chose an Angeline Pinot Noir and DH took the Leese-Fitch Adobe Merlot.  I am a fan of Angeline and there's always a few bottles in the rack at home, so it was what I expected, but DH said his merlot was very good.  Again, only a couple of minutes passed before we had our healthy pours and we took a look at the menu.  A lot of lovely offerings without being overwhelming.  I decided to start with the Lobster Bisque (not the most Eye-talian choice, but it was cold and a hearty bisque sounded good) and DH selected the Uncle Louie's house salad.  Italian or not, the Lobster Bisque, as our server said when I ordered it, was off the grid delicious.  Creamy and rich with a hint of sherry and FULL of chunks of succulent lobster.  I could hardly eat it fast enough!  My only caveat was that it could have been hotter.  It wasn't cold or even cool, but how incredible it would have been warmed a few more degrees.  DH said his salad tasted "just picked" and the light balsamic vinaigrette was delicious.  For my entree, I had the veal picatta and DH went for the chicken saltimbocca.  We had the choice of pasta or a medley of fresh sauteed veggies---we both had the pasta.  Well, there is a reason the veal picatta is the house specialty.  It left me speechless---probably because I was stuffing my mouth!  The quantity of perfectly cooked veal scallops was generous---I really shouldn't have been able to eat it all along with the mound of pasta, all deliciously soaking up this lemon and caper and wine sauce---oh, my!  Yet, I did.  And DH had absolutely no problem scraping his plate clean of his chicken saltimbocca, he said it was perfectly executed, without the over-reaching saltiness you often get with the prosciutto-wrapped chicken, and the chicken itself was so tender and moist.  Oh---I can't forget---my veal picatta was accompanied by two crusty wedges of buttery toasted bread and the most wonderful bruschetta...  It was juicy and garlic-y and all the things you want from a bruschetta.  Our server suggested the tiramisu to finish, but really---we couldn't.  We were ROTUND, at this point.  Which was sad, because everything was so good, we just wanted to eat more!  As I said, ambiance was comfortable, Uncle Louie and Marie and our server made us feel welcome and cared for.  We can't wait to go back.  The only reason I didn't give five stars is: 1) I SELDOM give five stars---I mean, that's the ultimate, right?; and 2) the lobster bisque and our entrees themselves could all have been a little hotter.  I know it was pretty cold for an Arizona night, but even so.  A pity they don't have the facilities to warm their plates, that might have helped.  But really---I have often mentioned that Italian food is not my very favorite cuisine, but I tell you---Uncle Louie's could change my mind.  Can't wait to return!

Heart and Soul is our go-to, but it was closed last night for a private party.  We had been to Gallagher's one time before, it was okay, so we crossed the parking lot for a second visit.  It will be our last.  I thought the Yelps I had read from previous diners were a bit harsh, but last night we got the full "Gallagher's experience".  Sign at the reception desk said: seat yourself.  We did, after searching thru a mostly empty dining room for a clean table.  We sat there maybe 5-6 miutes without a sign of a single staff.  I looked at my watch about then---7.45.  That's why I know it was twelve minutes later that the server finally showed up, sans menus.  She asked for our drink orders and then said, "Oh, I guess you guys want menus?"  (Um.,..yeah.)  About 5 minutes later, a Hispanic guy shows up with menus and asks if we'd been taken care of.  We said yes and he starts to walk away and we are like: wait---leave the menus.  He gives us this frantic look, like we are mugging him for the squares of laminated paper, but then he reluctantly hands them over.  (Score one for our team!)  A few minutes later, our server shows up with our drinks and some menus and she frowns at the menus we had scooped from the guy, puts our drinks on the table and starts to walk away, and DH says: no, wait, we are ready to order.  (We did't want to take the chance of losing her!)  I got the fish and chips, DH got the Cobb wrap with onion strings.  It arrived fast and ice-cold.  My chips (fries) were limp and greasy, fish was crispy looking and golden brown, but interior was dry and stringy---can we say over-cooked?  DH said his wrap was bland and dry---the tortilla was so bereft of moisture it was sucking the saliva out of his mouth.  His onion strings would have been delicious hot---they were surprising good even cold and congealed.  He did ask for some mayo to try to lube up the wrap, and seriously---she brought him about a teaspoon in a small black cup. (Gotta watch those food costs!)  The manager did do a drive-by a few minutes after we got our drinks but before our food arrived---how can I answer "how's everything guys?" when "everything" is iced tea and water with lemon?  (BTW, the iced tea was very good!)  He never came by to check in again. Neither did the server, although she did drop off the check about three minutes after the food---that's when DH was able to ask for the mayo.    Like another Yelper, we paid cash so we didn't have to endlessly wait for change and then got the heck out of there.  And no, we didn't leave a tip.  If our server didn't care about our dining experience, why should I care about her working experience?  Frankly, horrible service and horrible food.  You know, we desperately need another reasonably-priced "family" restaurant here in Cave Creek/Carefree---but Gallagher's isn't it.  So if you ever wonder why an attractive place with a decently varied menu is always mostly empty---read and believe the Yelps--I think they are only still open because they have like a bazillion tvs and (no pun attended) they are like the only game in town for that level of restaurant.

I decided to make my next trim and highlight appointment at Sonoran Beauty Salon because of it's proximity at home and it's great Yelps.  I walked in and was greeted by a nice, smiling receptionist.  I had to wait for about 2 minutes for my stylist to come get me,  giving me time to scope out the place.  Very, very clean and organized.  Everyone---stylists and clients---were smiling and there was lots of soft-voiced chatter.  It was a great vibe.  I liked that the walls are light and the decor minimal.  (Why do some salons bury themselves in dark colors that reflect on your face and hair and make you look BAD?)    My stylist came to get me.  Gabby.  What a sweetie.  She spent a good ten minutes messing with my hair and determining how she was going to recreate/blend the new color.  She even consulted with another stylist.  I like that.  Take your time, talk with your co-workers.  Don't mess up my hair.    During the color and trim, Gabby was a pleasant conversationalist---not too chatty, light-hearted.  When I had to take a business phone call, she didn't get huffy.  She gave me a great scalp massage when she rinsed my hair.  Ahhhhh!  She did a great job trimming my hair---I wanted a trim, not a cut or style.  Perfect.  I LOVE my color.  She actually brought in some bolder ribbons of light blonde.  I love that look.  I am not ready for the all-over matron-beige quite yet.  So, I seldom award more than 3 stars.  Three stars=A-Okay.  4 stars is "Yay, I'm a fan."  Who the heck do you give five stars---"Woo-hooo---as good as it gets"?  But I thought about it:  Very clean-check.  Nice vibe?  Check.  Nice, talented  stylist?  Check?  Happy with color and trim?  Check.  I can't really find a reason not to give 5 stars---plus why mess up the roll they're on, y'know?  Plus, I will return because I really, really like my hair color.  So.....5 Stars!

DH was getting pizza at #1 Brothers so I originally tried to order from the Japanese restaurant in the same plaza, but they failed to answer the phone after we called FOUR times!  Thank goodness.  Went to Ari and got the usual excellent service and good sushi.  What made me feel good---I was explaining to the girl who answered the phone that I had ordered the spicy tuna handroll before and had been disappointed in its consistency and our server had suggested a order it more coarsely chopped.  The young lady on the phone said: "Oh, yes, that was me---I was your server and I remember.  I know exactly what you want!"  And she did.  My spicy tuna handroll was exactly what I wanted and I felt good that she had remembered such a trivial incident when she deals with hundreds of customers.  Also, when I explained to her what my favorite specialty roll had been back at my old sushi joint, she was able to suggest a roll that very nearly the same and very good.  Actually, wait.  This was a Four star rather than a three star experience---let me go change my rating.  I feel like I have found my forever sushi place!  Thank you, Ari, for making me feel like a valued customer and not a faceless diner.

I love Good Egg.  That's all there is to say.  It's always great service and great food.  At this particular Good Egg, I liked the special blend iced tea so much our server arranged for me to buy a small amount!  The only con is you can't go to Good Egg on Sunday mornings---those church people will take you out!

Very disappointing and unhappy.  First appt was in June.  Told receptionist I wanted a "skin check" and also to have a tiny bump on my cheek checked.  I had had it for a couple of years---didn't cause any problems, but it annoyed me just being there.  An esthetician thought it was a clogged seborrheic gland  and suggested I have a dermatologist look at.  Nice office, nice staff at Phoenix Skin.  Shown to examining room and after a few minutes, PA comes in.  Quick and efficient.  Did my skin check in about 90 seconds, said all was good, whisked out.  I blinked, looked at nurse, and said, "What about...?"  She checked chart, said there was no notation, but she could see if he could come back.  Well, that sounded like it would be inconvenient for him, he seemed really busy, and maybe I wasn't clear about it to the receptionist, so I just shrugged and went home.  So the bump---not painful and---as DH said, not noticeable to anyone but me!---kept annoying me, so I made another appt.  October 1st.  This time I am seen by an older doctor.  He looks, ruminates that it probably is a clogged gland or pore, but to be on the safe side, should do a biopsy.  This alarmed me, and I asked him: "You are going to cut my face?"  He assured me that it would be very tiny, look like "you scratched your face hiking", but it was better to be on the safe side. Okay, he's a doctor, and there is a lot of skin cancer in AZ.  So there's this tiny sting, he pats me on the shoulder and leaves.  The nurse applies a band-aid to my cheek and gives me care instructions.  I look in the mirror---I do not like the band-aid look, but whatcha gonna do?  So I get home and later that day remove band-aid and almost pass out.  This is not a scratch---it's a HOLE!  I kind of freak.  DH tries to soothe, says probably looks bad cause it's first day, give it time.  I don't think I will live long enough for there to be enough time for it to look "normal".  Well, it's been two months and two weeks and I still have a freakin' divot in my face.  I have gone to plastic surgeon, who said he can't second guess another physician, but he probably would have taken a stitch when excising that amount.  His solution for this would be to actually cut out around the divot and then stitch.  Oh, yeah, like anyone is getting near my face with any kind of sharp instrument.  Apparently, I am always going to have this scar on my face now.  I have friends who have had multiple skin cancers removed from their faces and don't have this kind of mark.  I look in the mirror and feel a surge of anger and frustration.  Phoenix Skin had such excellent Yelp reviews, I felt really comfortable going to them, but I feel like I need to post this review, so people aren't too trusting and ask questions.  Oh---and it took two weeks to call me back with the biopsy results.  They called on October 15th.  Of course, it was fine.

Quick update-lunch with some friends.  I had the fish and chips.  Light, lovely batter and loved the mix of sweet potato and russet chips.  Housemade tartar sauce was very tasty.., almost as good as Frisch's tartar sauce!  Really liked the fruity ice tea and our server kept my glass topped.  She was a very good server.  A good experience yet again!

Disappointing.  Did windows, left streaks, promised to come back, did not return calls.  Understand undergoing ownership change?  Anyhow, will probably stick to our former company in the future.

Some notes: restaurant is located in the Esplandade with the AMC cinema and to the east of the Ritz Carleton.  Best bet is to park in the parking garage and then go to the walking mall.  Even so, it's tough to find.  Don't give up.  Also, it is no longer Fuego Tacos, but now Fuego del Mar, with a seafood-centric menu.    That being said.  I was pretty edgy by the time we arrived.  We're from Cave Creek and had been out shopping and then had a heck of a time finding the place, so we arrived about 8.15---pretty close to closing.  And I had a Groupon---and there are Yelp reviews that said the staff DOESN'T like Groupon-ers.  Greeted by guy that I assume is the gent someone described as "XL".  He's just a little round.  And was a warm, welcoming fella.  He beamed a smile at us, waved at dining room and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  We chose a cozy booth in the corner.  Our server was there in moments with menus and take our drink orders.  I wish I remembered her name---dark hair in a pony-tail, glasses, and really personable and nice despite it being the end of the night and we were late-comers.    Nice ambiance---exposed brick walls, soft light, great music---DH would have liked their playlist!  TROUBLE: she hands us the menu.  Except for one dish, everything is seafood.  Fuego Tacos is now Fuego del Mar.  DH doesn't like fish and is semi-allergic to shellfish.  I asked if he wanted to leave, and he said no, we had gone thru too much to find the place---he would just order the one non-seafood dish.  At least he didn't have to make a lot of choices!  So DH ordered the Pernil Asada, which was described as slow-cooked pork topped with mango-chile salsa.  His sides were the Green Chile-Bacon Hushpuppies and the Latin Succotash.  I ordered their signature dish of Seafood Chile Rellenos---a poblano pepper stuffed with shrimp, crab and tilapia in a lobster-tomato sauce with hush puppies and Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw.  For drinks, DH got the house red and I got a Pomegranate Adult Lemonade.  Drinks arrived in less than 5 minutes.  DH very happy with something he thought would be bottom row plonk.  My Adult Lemonade was SO delicious---I had to be careful!  I could have drank several of them.  It tasted like lemonade with a hint of fruit---but it definitely had alcohol in it!  Entrees arrived within 15 minutes of the drinks.  DH's was all on one plate.  Three hush puppies, Latin Succotash---which looked delish---and a mound of pork with the salsa.  Not super pretty.  My presentation was much more beautiful---a mammoth poblano pepper in a puddle of light red sauce.  Slaw and hush puppies on the side.  Lovely presentation.  My only comment is that serving something in a bowl (albeit large) that needs to be cut is problematic.  I'd like to say how wonderful DH's meal was, but basically I got one bite of his pork---that's all he would share---before he devoured it.  He said it was one of the best pork dishes he had ever enjoyed.  He felt like he was in the Caribbean!  I got no bites of the Succotash, darn him---looked so good!  He scarfed it all!   His hush puppies went that fast too!  Was my seafood Chile Relleno the best thing EVER?  No, but it was VERY, VERY GOOD!  Beautifully cooked, not greasy,  seafood not overcooked at all, the lobster-tomato sauce was delicious.  Again, only quibble I have is serving it in a bowl.  It was a very deep bowl too---a smaller girl might have had trouble reaching in there, but I am fairly tall and long-armed.  The hush puppies---shut my mouth, darlin', but they were dang good!  Lots of lovely, bacon-y flavor, a hint of heat, and a touch sweet.  What is it with those Yankees not adding a bit of sweet to their cornbread?  Whoever made these knew what they were doing.  The Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw was in a citrus-y, non-creamy dressing and the crispness, the fruitiness and the heat was a perfect counterpoint to the richness of the Relleno.  Huge portion---I ended up bringing home half the Relleno, Slaw and two hush puppies---LUNCH!  YUM!  DH swined his plate so it's deli turkey for him, hahaha!  Bonus---ended up talking to the gentleman in the booth next to us---so interesting.  He is a musician who's lived all over the US and the world---Europe and the Middle East.  Really neat guy.  I wouldn't live in the City, but I love visiting the City 'cause you meet the most interesting people!  So at the end, I pulled out my Groupon and gave it to our server, apologizing that I had "hid" it until the end, but that Yelp reviews had indicated Groupon-ers got short shift as far as service went.  She took it graciously with a smile and said one of the issues was when they were Fuego Tacos, people ordered $9 plates than proferred a $10 Groupon.  Not nice.  (BTW, Fuego del Mar entrees from $20-$25) For sure, we will be back.  It's a field trip for us, but worth it.  Just an all-around good experience.

Since my original November review, we have been to Yume at least half a dozen times.  I have to upgrade my rating to 4 stars.  We love this place.  Food is always fresh and good.  The lady who always waits on us (she must work 24/7!) is one of the sweetest people I have met in AZ---she is just so nice and always seems happy and always so anxious to make sure we feel like valued guests.  And we do---and now we have been in often enough that we are totally treated like regulars.  The sushi and sashimi are to die for---always fresh and beautifully prepared and DH and DSGF  ordered the bento box meals and just rave.  I am probably being a brat for not giving them 5 stars---it's because I have to drive 30 minutes to eat at Yume.  If they'd move closer to Cave Creek, I'd rate them a SIX star!  Yume-yume-yume in my tummy!

At a totally different nail place, I had a really pathetic manicure last time, so I approached Perfect Ten warily.  Yeah, they have great Yelp reviews, but maybe I am a lightening rod for evil nail techs.  It was definitely a Perfect Ten!  Both Lin and Vivienne serviced me, both were very nice, professional, and when I told them this was my first set of gel nails being removed---and that my experience in getting the gel manicure had been way sub-par---they both took the time to explain to me the process and what they were doing, so  that was very cool.  I like to understand the process!  I also noted that all the techs at Perfect Ten made an effort to greet newcomers and say good-bye as clients departed.  It's a very busy shop, but they had a smile and a wave for everyone.  All over the store, they have their customer service manifesto posted and they obviously live by it!  The place is pretty clean, but more importantly, I saw that they vigorously clean up after every client---tools and pedi-tubs, etc.  We have all heard nightmare stories of people getting infections when techs use unsterilized tools on them.    I ended up getting Mood-changing gel polish.  What a hoot!  Not the most crazy kind, just changes from a really dark Vampire-red to to a sparkly-red gold, but it makes me grin.  Vivienne chatted with me thru the service and she is so nice.  From start-to-finish, I had my old gel manicure removed and new one applied (and it was perfect and Vivienne shaped my nails beautifully!) and was out of there in an hour-and-ten for a very reasonable price.    I will definitely return to Perfect Ten for my next nail service.  Thank you, ladies!

I am posting this review at the dictation of DH, as I am the Yelper in the family.  We attended Taste of Cave Creek and DH tried the Brugos pizza from their stand.  Even though it had been baked at the restaurant and brought to Stagecoach Village site and warmed up, Mr. Pizza Connoisseur thought it was so good he got two more slices.  So a few days later he was up by El Pedregal about lunch-time (careful planning?) so he stopped into Brugos for lunch.  He said the dining room was very urban-cool with great views and he bet it would be very romantic at night.    He ordered a "Monty" sandwich.  It was a grilled chicken sandwich with pesto, provolone, tomatoes, onions and lettuce.  DH, who is as picky about bread as his pizza, said the bread was great.  In fact, the sandwich was great.  For about $10, it came with a side salad as well.  Such hefty portions, DH ended asking them to wrap up half the sandwich to bring home.  Therein lies his only disappointment---since it was a "working lunch", DH was trying to juggle his iPad and his briefcase and other business accoutrements when he departed and he inadvertently  left his sandwich behind on the table.  He was sorry about that.  (So am I---if he'd brought it home I could have sampled!)  He thought surroundings, food quality and value were all very good!  Also, his server turned out to be the owner of the restaurant, along with his wife, and DH said he was a really nice guy, and as small, family-owned business people, we appreciate other family businesses.  Why support some faceless corporate entity when you can go somewhere where they are literally putting their heart and name on the plates?  So DH wants to go back and try dinner.  Since he's always a bit of a skeptic when it comes to Italian, I know it must have been really good.  I am very curious to try it myself!  Plus who can resist a romantic dinner with views with your honey!

After DH's rave review of Brugo's lunch, I really wanted to like this place.    We had people in for the holidays and the two sets of adults decided to go to dinner and wanting something close to home, DH suggested Brugo's on the basis of the delicious lunch he had there a month ago.  The whole experience was odd.  First of all, the decor.  I guess in an earlier inception it was supposed to project a hip, urban look.  The current owners wanted to give it more of a "cheese-y Eye-talian" theme.  So they stuck red and green lightbulbs behind long, elegant dupioni silk wall sconces and laid the tables with red and white checked tablecloths.  DH liked it.  I thought it was kind of a bizarre mix.  What I didn't like: they do have this cool hanging mobile of glass bubbles (you can see it on their website) and as we walked by it, I could see a thick layer of dust on the bubbles.  I was really glad I wasn't the couple dining under it with all that crap sifting down on my food.  Ick.  The minutes you walk in the front door, you are greeted by blaring flatscreens above the bar.  It's a large restaurant, but only about three tables were seated, and it was the height of the dinner hour.  We got a nice booth by the window, but it was a dark and moonless night, so sadly none of the gorgeous view I knew was out there was visible.    Our server (the only one) was slightly frentic but attentive.  Our Dining Companions ordered a beer and a margarita and DH and I ordered wine.  I got the Hahn Pinot and he got the Raymond Cab.  These red wines were served chilled.  VERY chilled.  My wine was actually quite good, and I can only muse if it had been served at the appropriate 50-55 F and the flavor been allowed to bloom.  DH questioned questioned the server about the iciness of the wine and received a frown and a  "That's the way we serve it" tossed over his shoulder, although said server did return a few minutes later and offer to open a new bottle that apparently had not been refrigerated.  DH declined.  I am not a pizza eater and DH wanted to try an entree, but our DCs ordered the medium Big Combo pizza.  I had studied the menu online but looking at the specials, I saw that on (I think) Saturdays they had a sausage and pepper special, which sounded perfect on a chill night so I asked if it was possible to order that.  The server vanished and came back and said no, they had no sausages.  Fair enough.  The Thursday night special was Chicken Parmesan and also Eggplant, according to the website, so I ordered the eggplant.  The server said eggplant was not a special.  I said it said so on the website.  He said let me go check.  He came back a few minutes later and said they had no eggplant.  Okay.  So I ordered the Spaghetti and Pesto (I need to point out that the online menu is NOT up-to-date) and specified that I wanted the pasta slightly overcooked.  I do NOT like al dente pasta.  (Why do I want pasta sticking to my teeth?)  DH ordered the Chicken Parm.  Our meals arrived with 15-20 minutes.  DC's pizza was a smallish medium but it just had a "rid-hard" look.  It just looked sort of "dry-ish" and the crust looked very, very brown.  I asked DC's how it was, and they said: "okay."  (For $22.50 for a 12 inch pizza, I would have liked our out-of-town guests to be more enthusiastic!)  My spaghetti and pesto was cooked perfectly---just past al dente to a nice softness, but otherwise was bland and tasteless.  Thank goodness for the salt and pepper shakers or I wouldn't have known I was putting food in my mouth.  The accompanying slice of bread was toasted hard, cold, and unappetizing. DH was sad about his Chicken Parm.  He said it tasted (and it looked) as if it had plated earlier and then spent some time under the heat lamps.   He said the tomato gravy supposedly from an old family recipe tasted canned and the chicken was not moist or seasoned.    None of us finished our meals, although we packed up the leftovers because we had five teenagers waiting at home and they'll eat anything.  Overall, a disappointing experience.  DH said the memory of his lunch was such that he will try it again at noon and urges me to come with and see if I like their sandwich offerings better, but for sure we will probably not be back for dinner.  For the quality of the food and the bizarre ambiance, it was a very expensive and lackluster meal.    In defense, El Pedregal is a sad little plaza now that The Heard Museum has moved.  Most of the shops are empty and your footsteps echo weirdly in the silence.  The new owners of the center have made no effort to attract new tenants and I hear they really want to tear it down and build more condos for The Boulders.  Probably with the lack of traffic, Brugo's has to keep their food costs down by really tightly controlling their inventory, and I imagine the rent is pretty high, hence the high menu prices, but that's no excuse for bland, dried-up food.  I don't know if I would ever try again.

I enjoyed a pretty good lunch at Cibo e Vino a couple of weeks ago, so when friends called and wanted to go out for dinner Friday night and were open to suggestions, this is where I suggested.  Oh, dear.  We arrived at 5.45 to take advantage of HH prices and were told there was no dining seating available on the patio, we would have to eat inside.  Bummer, 'cause it was a gorgeous evening, but it WAS Bike Week.  So we sat at the bar to have cocktails---we were told we'd be seated in about 10 minutes.  Good, we're hungry.  At 6.30, one of our DC's (DC=Dining Companion) went and lassoed the young hostess, who said "five minutes more".  Ten minutes later, DC went back in AGAIN and she must have been firm, because the hostess came out to collect us, only to pause and then say: "Oh, wait, there's another table I need to seat first."  DC nailed her with a steely glare and the child gulped and led us into the dining room, where only half the tables were occupied.  (WTH?)  We should have stayed out at the bar and just drank.  Walking into that dining room was like walking into a wall of heat.  And there was a chemically smell---the other of our DC;s, a former builder, guessed it was whatever finishing product they used on the (very attractive) back wall of reclaimed wood.  I mean the restaurant looks very nice.  You can tell they did it on a budget, but I actually like that better than an over-the-top place (plus there are ideas I can steal, heeheehee)  Our waitress came.  We commented on the heat and she agreed: "It's hotter in the dining room than the kitchen!"  But I have to tell you, this young woman provided stellar and personable service throughout the night---she was a bright light in an otherwise dim evening.    The bread that was brought to our table was good---nothing special.  Everyone was starving at this point, so we skipped the appetizers and went straight for meals.  DC #1 ordered the chicken parm and a dinner salad, DC #2 ordered The Bartlett Pizza and dinner salad, DH ordered a pepperoni and onion pizza and dinner salad and I ordered the Tuscan Risotto and Caesar salad.  Salads came out pretty promptly, were fresh, but again, nothing special.  Just nicely dressed salads, fresh, with decent dressing.  Entrees arrived in a timely manner as we finished our salads---nice pacing.  Unfortunately...  DC #2's pizza was dead cold.  On the other hand, DH's pie was bubbling hot and he said it was pretty darn good.  (Is their new pizza oven too small to bake two pizzas at once?)  So The Bartlett was sent back to the kitchen for a reheat and DC #2 urged us to go ahead and eat so our food didn't get cold.    Like I said, DH liked his pizza.  He said he would put it on the positive side of a 1-10 scale---maybe a 6.5-7?  DC #1's chicken parm---well, the chicken was well cooked, but the tomato sauce ladled over it was very acidic---not well balanced at all, and DC #1 did not like it.  Oddly enough, the spaghetti that was the side was tossed with an entirely different sauce that was actually pretty good!  (I tasted both sauces and there was a very noticeable difference!) As for my Tuscan Risotto.  I really should have sent it back, it was so disgusting.  Look, if someone back in the kitchen had a lick of sense, it could have been a delicious dish---sausage, green and red peppers, onions, and, of course, arborio rice.  The rice was really well cooked.  Tender but with some bite.  But there was so much cheese mixed into the risotto it was a nasty, greasy mess (see photo---that yellow blob about six o'clock on my plate is a puddle of grease), and once my meal started to cool, all that cheese started globulifying and it was just...gross.  I think I ended up eating scarcely 1/5 of a $22 dinner, once I had removed enough and all that yellow-y grease started oozing.  Like I said, I should have returned it. Instead, I actually allowed Nice Server to box it!  (What was I thinking?) As for DC #2, when his re-heated pizza was brought out to him, it was now hot, but dried out.  He ate one piece and then had it boxed---he probably did what I did, which is just dropped the carry-out container into the garage garbage can when I got home.    I am not sure why I am giving this place 2 stars, except DH liked his pizza and our server was such a sweetie.  But I probably won't go back---at least not to eat.

Dinner Tuesday, 5/14/13.  Service efficient, but not warm and friendly.  Maybe because we walked in at 8.30 pm?  The chips and salsa: chips tasted stale and store bought.  Salsa was okay, but seemed to get its heat from a generous helping of hot sauce rather than integration of chile peppers.  DH ordered chicken carnitas and was very happy with his meal.  I ordered Burrito Loco with carne asada.  90% rice with 8% beans and a small amount of tough, unseasoned strips of beef.  I didn't care for the tortilla it was rolled in----tasted flour-y and raw.  Green chile sauce undetectable.  Guacamole was good.  Ice tea was good and served with a generous wedge of lemon----waited refilled several times.  All in all, I found my meal pretty bland bordering on tasteless.  But it was filling and fast and as I said, DH was happy with his.  I probably won't insist on going back, though.  I know there is better Mexican out there.

I rarely give a 5 star Yelp.  Never to a restaurant.  Never say never.  When we came out of Soul Cafe, DH turned to me and said: "You need to Yelp the hell out of this place."  He meant that in a good way.  I know this, because during his meal, he also used words like: "exceptional", "awesome", "5 star", and "when do you want to come back?"  I wasn't able to answer, because I was in the middle of a foodgasm.  Decor: Urban, elegant, warm.  Scottsdale-y, as to be expected.  Love the artwork on the walls.  Music was excellent selection, not so loud we could not easily converse.  Service: Excellent.  From the smiling and immediate greeting at the door to our server, Dereck.  Dereck was warm, professional and well-informed on wine and menu.  The only worble---ONLY---in the meal was that our appetizer and salads came out at the same time.  We did not like this.  Might have brought rating down a star if there had been further issues collectively, but there weren't, and happily, the pretzel nubs were a perfect accompaniment to the fresh fruitiness of the salad.  Food: DH and I started with glasses of wine.  I got the La Merika Pinot (yum!) and DH was thrilled to see on the list one of his favorites, a Crusher Merlot.  They also offer a comprehensive selection of specialty cocktails, but we were drinking wine before we arrived and chose not to venture from that.  We ordered the pretzel nubs appetizer with a jalapeno cream sauce and a spicy mustard.  When Dereck came to tell us the nubs would be up in a moment is when we gave him the rest of our dinner order: a shared black kale, orange & avocado salad with orange vinaigrette and DH ordered the Roast Pork Loin with Jalapeno-Bacon Risotto and I ordered the Pork Belly with Chipotle Grits.  Despite the staggered order times, the appetizer and salad came out together.  Dereck apologized and offered to take the salads back to the chiller.  We said never mind, but DH asked to please be sure our entrees were not served until we were done with our salads.  Pretzel nubs were super hot, dough-y, salty, browned bits of goodness with yummy sauces to dip in.  I really loved the salad---which, btw, they divided before bringing to the table.  DH wasn't sure he liked the black kale, but he loved the rest, in particular the dressing.  And it just so turned out the the hot salty yeastiness of the nubs was a lovely counterpoint to the crisp, fruity coolness of the salad.  But even so...  Our demolished plates of pretzel nubs and salads were carried away and with about a minute breather, our entrees arrived.  DH was ecstatic over his.  He said it was the possibly the best restaurant meal he has had in Arizona.  The pork was soft and silky and perfectly cooked with this lovely herb-y crust, the slices resting on a precisely executed risotto that was sparky with touches of heat and bacon-y bliss.  My pork belly and grits---well, what's not fabulous about slabs of beautifully roasted bacon prettily arranged on a bed of golden grits?  The meat melted in my mouth.  If I want to nit-pick, I could say that while the grits had a lovely chipotle flavor throughout, I might have enjoyed more overall heat, but I know that's a preference and a chef can't alienate a restaurant of diners by making the food too spicy for the general tastebud.  But what I did like was there were little flashes of heat, so I'd be nibbling along and all the sudden---ZIP!    Mine was a "smaller plate" and DH's a regular sized entree, we had enough portion of each left to bring home.  Though we were too full for dessert, Dereck was kind enough to describe them to us so we could drool vicariously.  And, as DH said, "Maybe next time I'll have the Soul Cookie Sundae as my first course."  We have been looking for our dedicated "go-to" restaurant and Soul Cafe may be it.  We'll see how our next visit goes---if we get the same fabulous food and service, they better mark a table with our name on it!  According to Dereck, Chef changes the menu every few days according to what is fresh and available, so we'll never get bored.  It's close to our house.  Oh, I hope this works out.  And, I understand it's related to Heart and Soul Cafe on Carefree Highway, which offers elevated diner food---comforting, but one step beyond.  Therefore, the creativity and excellent execution of the Soul Cafe menu is no surprise.    So this is my first 5 star restaurant review.  Thank you for a lovely evening, Soul Cafe.

I don't like going to favorite restaurants because it seems like you get short-changed at Restaurant Week. Not so at Soul Cafe. Thank goodness we could not resist the proffered menu. Our meal was off the charts. I started off with the Fried Green Tomato Caprese , DH got the Scallop Rockefeller---both AMAZING! Followed up with 2nd course: DH got a Gazpacho that he said was the best part of his entire meal---he wanted to bathe in it!----and I got the Brussels sprout salad, which I did not love. Too much texture for me, but the dressing was delicious. For our 3rd course, DH had the filet mignon over a blue cheese risotto and port wine reduction and I had the seafood paella. Butter my butt and call me a biscuit! UNBELIEVABLE! We wanted to finish with one of the half-baked cookies for dessert, but there was no room. Our service was excellent--as usual--and the band was great! Chef Sheila rocks our world---as always. And somehow, in all the craziness, she had time to come out and visit tables and be her usual sweet, personable self. Soul Cafe---A+++++!!!

Sitting on the patio on a Sunday afternoon watching the Ladies of Maricopa County in their impossibly high heels and very short skirts (how do they stride along like that????) stroll by was fun.  As for the rest---after wanting so badly to try the Barrio Queen and being thwarted countless times, all I can say is: what a disappointment,  Of the four of us, not a single diner at our table could find anything really positive to say. The Mexican food at Filiberto's is better and so is the service.  All I hear about is all the accolades the chef/owner has received----she must be juicing the judges up on margaritas.  Won't be back.

In previous Yelps, I have mourned that the closest Filiberto's for my chile relleno fix is a goodly 30-40 minute drive from Cave Creek.   I mourn no more.  We discovered Armando's when it was featured in Carefree-Cave Creek Chamber of Commerce newsletter---DH found it and asked if I knew there was a little Mexican place along Carefree Highway?  And, you know, it kind of sounded "Filiberto-ish"? Nope, did not.  So we had driven up to Cottonwood on an errand and it just so happened we hit 7th and CH right at dinner time and we just wanted some take-home so we could go home and put up our feet and eat and drink wine.    We went inside.  Brightly lit---typical "---berto's" decor (you know, Filiberto's, Roberto's, Edberto's, Sueberto's...) with about a half dozen people at the tables.  And, just like every "Berto's" I have been in---spotlessly clean!  I LOVE that!!!!  Just about the same menu too!  So, what do you think I ordered?  Yeppers---#11...chile rellenos-no-rice-extra beans-green chile sauce.  (Sometimes I am sooo boring!)  DH got the carne asada burrito-no rice-extra beans-red sauce.  We took them home, and because it's SO CLOSE to our house, our meals were still really warm when we sat down.  What can I say---delish.  Freshly prepared, nicely fried (no old grease flavor!), filled with gooey cheese and a generous portion.  I was in heaven.  The green chile sauce really had flavor---it was actually not on par with Filiberto's---it was better!  DH really liked his carne asada burrito---he said it was great flavor, tasted very fresh.  The beans were good.  So, this is now our go-to Mexican carry-out---I'll probably be in there at least once a week.  If DH and I have any caveats, it was that we wish we could get different beans.  It would be nice if they offered Borracho beans (I'll give them my recipe!) or black or pinto beans----refried beans are just kind of---refried beans.  But very tasty, nonetheless---have you ever had the ones that have that weird lardy-taste?  These do not!  And the lady who waited on us---Latina, forty-ish, dark hair pulled back in a knot---is very nice.  And someone complained about a wait---I didn't time it, but I can pretty much guarantee we did not wait over 7 minutes for our meals, which I think is acceptable for something that is made-to-order.  You want Mexican in three minutes, go to Taco Hell,  where everything is pre-prepared  and has been sitting on the steam table for six hours.  Philistines!  So I am a happy camper.  And I can quit sending Filiberto's headquarters emails asking for a store up further north!

DH and I had never heard of Market Street Kitchen until we bid on and won a gift certificate at a benefit for the Cave Creek Museum, but decided to try it out  for our anniversary dinner rather than go to one our usual haunts.  Brilliant decision!  The restaurant itself is beautiful, with a lovely outdoor dining area and inside it's an attractive rustic-industrial chic.  Our server was note-perfect---personable, informative and on-the-ball without being over-attentive.  We started off with a shared smoked salmon ceviche that was generous in portion and hit all the right notes---the fish had the tang of salt, the vinaigrette had a acid bite, the arugula provided a lovely green taste.  DH had the Friday night prime rib special.  The blue-cheese mashers were so good and the slab of prime rib was cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned.  I had the scallops with dirty risotto and wow!  The scallops were properly cleaned and had a gorgeous sear, and that rice....! A bit of a spice and lots of bacon with a little sweet corn mixed in---oh, my!  So, not only do they give back to the community (by donating a gift certificate to the Cave Creek Museum), but then they give you a wonderful dining experience.  Can't wait to go back---our lovely server promised us that the brussels sprouts with bacon are off the charts and I really want to try their fish and chips---one of those deceptively simple dishes that can make or break a restaurant, imho!

I just realized I have never written a review for Hacienda's.  In five months, we have been there four times, so that should say something, when you have a plethora of restaurants to choose from in Northern Phoenix.  Ambiance---very nice.  Think up-scale casual with a hint of Mexico in the artwork.  Not cheesy Mexican---very tasteful.  Service---our first time server was a very nice lady.  Subsequent times we always make sure we sit in an area serviced by this great guy whose name---I think---is Joe or Jose.  He always tell us to call him the "Mean Mexican".  He's not mean at all.  He's a charmer and makes us laugh thru the whole meal.  His personality and great service is one of the reasons we always return.  Food: We love their salsa and chips.  The chips are housemade---amongst them these spinach ones that have this fabulous, puffy texture---I could eat them by the boat-load!  If we have the "kids" with us---two 19 year olds---they always order the chicken quesadillas because they love them.  The last three visits, DH has gotten the chicken flautas or the chicken chimichangas.  He can't decide which he likes best.  Probably in a perfect world, he could get both on the same plate.  I am more adventurous.  My first visit, I got the Conchinita Pibil, which is described a traditional Mayan dish of marinated, slow-cooked pork.  I didn't care for it much.  No quality issue here---I am evidently just not a traditional Mayan eater.  Second visit--chile relleno: pretty dang good---and if you have read previous reviews by me, you'll know I am VERY picky about my chile rellenos.  Third visit: carnitas burrito.  Very tasty.  Fourth visit: Pollo con Mole: a bit intense for my tastebuds, but was quite good leavened with the accompanying white rice mixed with carrots and peas.  For my next visit, I am targeting the Green Chile Enchiladas.  Food is always very good, high quality, and the service is great.  We love Mexican food and have been so surprised to find how hard it is to find really good Mexican in our area.  Hacienda Grill has become our go-to place when we need that flavor and we need it now in a fun, relaxed atmosphere.  And it's like 5 minutes from our house.  Perfect!

Authentic Mexican, always delicious and hot and quickly served, truly the nicest staff in the Valley with a handsome, relaxing ambiance...what's not to like?  Except I always fill up on the delicious house-made chips and the salsa they make with roasted tomatoes followed by a delicious entree...a different dish every visit...can't decide on a fave....never have room for dessert!

DH and I have been looking for some great Asian food close to home and Z's is literally four minutes from our house----lucky us!    Very simple, but relaxing ambiance.  We were warmly greeted and seated immediately.  We started off with two glasses of wine---DH got a merlot and I ordered a pinot, which they were out of but the gentleman who was our server suggested another pinot that had an unusual smokiness that I enjoyed---wish I could remember its name!  Econte?  We started off with the tempura vegetables.  Oh, wow, were they good.  Broccoli, and sweet potatoes and zucchini, carrots and green beans---nice sized wedges with a perfect layer of light, crispy, ungreasy batter.  Our only caveat---the serving was WAY too much for two people!  We were only able to manage half the plate and leave room for our entrees.  I think maybe next time we'll see if they can do a half-size!  Because you definitely don't want to miss the entrees!  It's been a long time since we had good Thai, so that where DH and I went.  I was really tempted by the crab-fried rice, that was complimented by several Yelpers, but I decided to go with the red curry and I said to "surprise me" with the protein, which ended up being some lovely, tender, tasty chunks of pork swimming in a delicious, spicy, coconut-y broth.  Oh, mouth-bliss.  Just spicy enough to make my tastebuds sing, but not so much I got what I call "hot-cupps" (hiccups created by really spicy food!).  DH got the Panang Curry with Chicken and again, great quality chicken with a wonderful sauce and plentiful veggies.  We ate and ate and ate it was so good, but it's like our plates were bottomless!  We actually ended up having plenty to take home as leftovers, along with that tempura (which was still pretty good the next day, though sadly tempura really isn't great leftovers).  So a very reasonably priced meal was made even more so because we ate off it for two days!    I liked it, but DH thought the fish sauce was a bit heavy, but since it's obvious everything is made from scratch, I am sure we can easily ask they lighten that up a bit.  Alas, I was way too chubbed out to try either of the desserts I was eyeing---the Fried Banana or the Lychee vs Black Sweet Sticky Rice----I was very intrigued by the latter---but I'll figure that out for the next visit.  And next visit there will be!  DH wants to try the Teriyaki and I want to try the crab-fried rice...but the Black Pepper Sauce sounds good too...and then there are all the specials...oh, dear....too much good food, too little time!

Quick every other year update: still love the tempura vegetables and ANY of the curries, adore the Tom Kha soup, think the crab rice sucks, and just tried Black Pepper Pork with Tofu and it was most excellent.  Definitely Cave Creek/Carefree's BEST Asian restaurant---forget the other two joints located within the town boundaries, trust me!  THIS is the place to indulge yourself in Asian food!  :)

Was at Target and then had an appointment, so with time to kill, thought I'd treat myself to lunch.  Nice place.  Bright, clean, well-decorated.  Service through-out was very good, if not warm and fuzzy.  Although I seated myself, I had a menu within moments, ice tea came promptly and was kept filled.  Server checked in twice to see if there was anything else I needed.  If there was a service problem before, it's been rectified.  Food: I ordered a chicken gyro and upped to onion rings for 99 cents.  Maybe a bad choice---I can't help but compare what I had at the Summit with the gyros from Greek Pita at Happy Valley.  All I could think was GFS (that's Gordon Food Service)  The chicken was plentiful on the nicely grilled pita, but there was nothing Greek about it.  It tasted like an anonymous herbed chicken breast that comes in a 10 lb bag.  It was okay.  It's probably the same anonymous chicken breast they use for a couple of dishes.  About a tablespoon of small dice tomatoes and two (I counted) slivers of red onion.  The tzatziki came in one of those little lidded plastic cups and if it had any flavor, I could not discern it.  The onion rings were definitely out of a GFS or Costco freezer.  But they were crisply fried and not greasy.  But for flavor and satisfaction, I'd give it a two.  Quantity of food: a 5.  If the level of food had matched the service and cute decor, this place would have been a winner and on my list.  But as it is...  Waaay over priced at $9.99 for the gyro and then the upcharge for the onion rings.  (Lunch for one person was fifteen bucks and some change)  But for that kind of lunch money, I want food that's been prepared for me, not defrosted.  Like I said, I am a fan of Greek Pita and you can't compare what you get from GP for 5.95 to the Summit gyro.  However, maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  Maybe ordering Greek at a Scottsdale "diner" is akin to ordering Italian at Applebees.  You deserve what you get.    I might try it again, if its the right time and place---maybe another menu item would be better.  I'll let you all know....

So we picked up the girls after six days at Pet Paradise.  We caslled several times during our trip and got detailed reports on how the girls were doing.  We were told how they were eating and sleeping, how they got along in play group, a couple of funny stories...  It was like our Cali and Tuzi were the only pups spending the week at Pet Paradise!  We didn't think we would land in time to pick them up Tuesday night so we had arranged for Wednesday morning, but then we found out we might just make it by 5.30-6.00, so we called and asked if we could get the girls Tuesday night.  (We missed them!)  Then our flight landed 45 minutes early!  So we called to see if there was any way they could get their go-home baths and be ready earlier.  Pet Paradise didn't blink an eye---when we walked in the door at 5.00, the girls were washed and brushed and sweet-smelling.  I won't say our pups didn't want to leave, but you could tell they had had a good time.  It was more about being happy to see Mom and Dad then a "oh, gosh, get me out of this gulag" kind of thing.  They looked great, acted happy, and everyone at Pet Paradise milling around the reception area had a warm word and pet of farewell for the girls.    I still hate this corporate reservation thing, but now that I know how to get around it it, that quibble is over.  I feel very comfortable and believe that our girls are in very good hands at Pet Paradise!

DH and I stayed at Carefree Resort and Conference multiple times during our house-hunting expeditions, but think we ate at The Lariat only once, early on, before we discovered Carefree Station and it became our "go-to" restaurant.  Well, with CS a sad memory, we are conducting try-outs for another local place---somewhere we can get a delicious meal in nice surroundings at reasonable prices minutes from our home.    Arrived about 7 pm Saturday night and the large dining room was bustling, but a pleasant  hostess seated us within minutes at  by the french doors.  We were immediately supplied with a wine list and menus, but the hostess asked if we knew about the Saturday night prime rib special.  Prime rib---yum!  For $16.95, we got a 6 oz piece of meat, our choice of baked or mashed potatoes, and a veggie choice---asparagus, broccolini, or seasonal veggies.    Checking out the menu, funnily enough with it's cowboy name and western ambiance---The Lariat menu is heavy on fish!  Most of the appetizers and a large number of entrees features our finned friends.  Our server, when he promptly arrived, told us that they have a seafood buffet the first Friday of every month that is huge and fabulous!  I wish I could tell you all the dishes on the menu, but I didn't think to grab a photo and the menus on any website are way out of date and no page on the Carefree Resort site.  But they looked delish.  I was torn between the flounder or the halibut and DH was really thinking about a pasta dish that made him salivate.  In the end, we chose to go with the prime rib special.  Started with a field greens salad---not included in the special---choosing to share.  Happily, it arrived on separate plates---very generous and served with a white balsamic vinaigrette that was WAY too tangy for me, though DH loved it.  I requested something more mellow and our server brought me some ranch.  Obviously, all the dressings are house-made---the ranch also had more tang than say---Hidden Valley and was thinner, but it was very tasty and more appealing to me.  Greens and veggies were all very fresh.  We received a basket of bread---seeded rolls and wheat rolls.  DH liked the seeded rolls so much he requested another and they gladly brought a basketful.  I thought the bread was good but a tad chewy---I suspect maybe it got a zap in a microwave to warm it up.  DH ordered a glass of Millbrandt cab and I had a glass of Coppola Pinot Noir---we enjoyed both.   Our meals arrived.  DH had went medium rare with seasonal veggies and a loaded baked potato and I went rare and mashed with broccolini.  Both pieces of meat were served perfectly to our request.  Veggie servings were generous---we aren't talking about six daintily arranged pieces---we are talking about a mound, sauteed perfectly so they were tender and crisp and still green color.  DH's seasonal veggies was a half-bushel of zucchini and yellow squash chunks, again sauteed to the point of tender-crisp. Mashed potatoes good but ordinary.  DH's potato was piled with cheese and bacon and green onions and butter and sour cream and he was happy, but I thought it could have been warmer.  He was happy though.  Of course, we got little cups of au jus, which was tasty, but not over-salty, as it can be. I requested and was immediately brought a portion of creamy horseradish sauce.  Yum!  Well, the meat was excellent.  A touch of fat for flavor, seasoned with a lovely salty-peppery rub, cooked to order, as I mentioned earlier, and DH, who is more filet mignon than prime rib, commented it didn't have the "game-y" taste he often associates with prime rib.  (I refrained from telling him that's called "flavor", unlike those over-priced blobs of tasteless meat he usually orders!)  DH cleaned his plate---except for a couple of morsels he put aside for the four-legged Queen.  I just could not eat it all despite my best efforts. I ended up bringing a whole 'nother meal home with me.  Disappointing---not having another delicious lunch planned for Sunday---but because I would like to have tried their desserts, which I understand are very good.  Instead, I settled for a cup of coffee to finish my meal.  And I have to say---whoo-doggie!  I don't know if they have a proprietary blend or what, but that was some cup of coffee.  I definitely had to cream it up.  DH said it reminded him of the coffee in Italy.  It was really good!  If they sold it in the resort lobby, I'd buy some!  Ambiance was very nice---casually elegant.  You can tell restaurant was constructed in the 60's---it has that sense---but nicely updated.  Service was excellent.  Thank you, Sean!  We'll absolutely be back to try the seafood buffet and the rest of the menu.  The Lariat is definitely a contender to be our Cave Creek-Carefree "go-to".

Okay, so last Friday we decided to try out the Famous Seafood Buffet the Lariat Grill at Carefree Resort and Conference Center puts on the first Friday of every month.  Well.  Stick with the Saturday night prime rib special.  Seriously, what a disappointment.  First off, cold.  The dining room was cold, the food was cold, and the food that was supposed to be cold, like the peeled shrimp and crab legs were literally icy.  It was cute how they had the soups sitting on these little stacks of brick with a burner hidden inside, but the heat wasn't getting to the soup.    The Caprese salad was good.  DH doesn't do seafood, so he ordered a filet mignon, medium rare.  It arrived so well done the meat was a dark taupe.  And it and the baked potato were...cold.  Yeah, he sent it back but in the meantime, I am dutifully eating (but not enjoying) the seafood buffet because that cost $33.  DH's filet was $36.  The server did say DH could go hit the buffet for anything he wanted while they re-fired the filet, but the reason he didn't order the buffet in the first place was because he doesn't like seafood!    It took (I timed it) almost 17 minutes to get the re-fired filet back out.  By that time, I had moved on to the desserts.  They were okay, tasted better then the fish, but they were all commercially prepared.  And all heavy, dense chocolate.  I would say the little mousse cakes (sort of like those Philly cheesecake/Nilla wafer things) were the best.  A lighter dessert option would have been nice.  We would never, ever go back for the seafood buffet.  And frankly, was this our first experience with The Lariat, probably never go back at all!  But that prime rib we had a couple of Saturday nights ago was really good.  So we'll try the Saturday night special again and see if the quality is maintained.  Was it's goodness that night an anomaly---or was the horridness of our experience this past Friday?  Enquiring minds want to know....

Since moving to the area, this is my second salon visit.  The first was to a well-reviewed place down Scottsdale Road, but though I was not unhappy with my hair, I felt like the stylist was just writing it in---when someone is working on something as intimate and important as your hair, you want to think they CARE!  This girl was young and silent and brooding and showed very little interest in making sure I was happy with my cut, style and color.  So my next appointment, I made with Salon Mila at Stagecoach Village.  They told me my stylist would be Stella.  Stella is super!  Wonderful!  Caring!  Talented!  She is also a recent transplant from the East, so it was fun to compare experiences---she actually chatted lightly as she worked.    The salon itself is a bit consciously trendy, but it had a cute little boutique and comfy chairs.  After she introduced herself and got me seated at her station, Stella spent time learning about what I like and don't like about my hair texture, it's style (or lack of!), and the color.  As she spoke to me, she also touched my hair, assessing it's condition.  Then we discussed what I was hoping for and what she could do.  When I voiced some trepidation, she assured me: "Don't worry, you are in good hands!"  And when I sniffled at having to lose several inches of hair because of it's dry, ratty, frizzy condition, she told me: "You'll be glad and it will grow back much better."  (I am glad---the ends look super now!  And I assume it will also grow back just like Stella promised!)  While she had the color on my hair, Stella also ended up giving me a manicure.  (She's well-rounded!)  She did a super job and I felt all girl-y and pretty---it had been *forever* since I'd had a manicure---why?  My nails look fab!  Long story short---and long hair slightly shorter----love my hair!  Stella put in some long layers so I have some bounce and body and the length isn't pulling my face down, and as I said earlier, though I was sad to lose a couple of inches, it looks so much more healthy now.  The color is perfect, the rich caramel blonde I wanted.  I am from a small (about the size of Cave Creek) town in the Midwest, but close to two large cities and the conveniences available there, and I thought Salon Mila's prices were totally acceptable---about what I paid at home for that kind of quality cut and color with the deliciously scented Aveda products. I liked that Stella really seemed to pay attention to the condition of my hair and what would flatter my face shape and age and lifestyle and do what was best for me without going out of my comfort zone (no pixie cuts!!!).  She was very confident and competent without being arrogant.  She chatted, but not excessively and when we were silent, it was a comfortable quiet.  I miss my stylist from back East, but I think I have found my new stylist in the Southwest.  I'll definitely be rescheduling with Stella.

Visited EVO last night in company with our Meet-Up group, Educating Wine Lovers in Arizona.  Nick, EVO's owner, and his crew of servers couldn't have been more lovely and welcoming to the group.  We were set up by our group's leader for a wine tasting of EVO's wine on tap plus appetizers.  We learned a lot about wine on tap thanks to Nick---it's really *better* in a lot of ways than bottled!  And although I am a red wine drinker, I had a lovely little Coppola Pinot Grigio that I think might become my "before sundown" beverage of choice!  We also had some wonderful appys---two different bruchettas---a tasty tomato-basil and then this to-die-for one with rare slices of beef tenderloin and slices of asparagus---so good!  The bruchettas were followed by pizzas---Funghi and a Gorgonzola "white" pizza.  The mushrooms on the Funghi were roasted and the flavors just burst in your mouth.  The chef had added a touch of honey to the Gorgonzola pizza, that really took it to another level.  Now, I don't really like pizza---it's the crust and red sauce, mostly, so I tend to fork off the toppings to enjoy.  But DH, he is formerly from NJ and is the self-proclaimed pizza expert, said the hearth baked pizza crusts were light and crispy and perfect.  The expert speaks!  And the ambiance of the whole place was so nice and relaxing and fun and the staff was so great---we can't wait to go back.  DH wants to try some of their other pizzas or the Bistecca, while I am torn by the Scallop dish or I so love a well-done risotto as well...  Well, that's obviously at least two more visits!  It's probably just as well EVO is almost 30 minutes from our house or we'd probably park ourselves on their doorstep several nights a week!  Thanks, everyone at EVO, for a great evening!

I kind of went back and forth on how many stars to give Teatro, but here's the deal: DH's lasagna arrived cold and though he did not complain about the sauce, when I got a taste, I thought the Bolognese had a weird consistency---way too fine, like they had run the meat thru a food processor.  It was also a little flat---kind of one note.    The male half of the couple we were dining with had the Tagliatelle and he seemed disappointed with the Bolognese sauce as well.  Now, the female half of the couple and I both ordered the gnocchi in a gorgonzola sauce with arugula and prosciutto.  Oh my gosh---that sauce was DELICIOUS!!!!  Unctuous to the tongue and full of flavor and you had the herbaceousness of the arugula and the salty-crispy-savoriness of the ham----sadly, the gnocchi were waaaay overcooked----I can't even describe how soft they were.  And I am a girl who does NOT like al dente.  But there was no tooth at all.  Jet-puff marshmallows have more density.  Well, maybe not if you cooked them in sauce...but do you get what I am saying?  They bring a carafe of water to your table, but it totally had the chlorinated flavor of city tap water.  Can we say "Brita"?  Those little things matter!  Anyhow, on the GOOD side: the house-made focaccia was very good, the salads very crisp and fresh, if not memorable, and I thought we received excellent service.  (And yes, the waiter asked if we were happy with the meals and so did the manager/owner, but I didn't want to come off foodie/bitch with some folks we are just getting to know.)  DH and I shared a Central Coast Pinot Noir that was on a Wednesday night special (all bottles half off) and it was pretty good.    All our dinnerware, cutlery, and glassware was clean.  My menu did have sort of an icky stain on it.  And the big wire thingie in the center of the table for folks who were going to order pizza took up an inordinate amount of room on a smallish four-top.  The place itself is painted in warm colors, but they need to bring something in that will absorb some sound.  As the place filled up---and it did fill up!---it became very hard to hear the conversations at our table, and I would say none of the four of us are mumblers.  And I think there is a real missed opportunity behind the bar.  There's a place to set up a beautiful and lighted barback that would be a feature in the restaurant.  Instead they have some weird newspaper-y wallpaper and a Kmart RTA bookshelf with 6 packs of beer displayed on it.    So, I thought and thought...did the pretty good salads and a killer gorgonzola cream sauce and good service outweigh cold food, weird Bolognese sauce, and chlorinated water?  Ummm...no, but you know, with a couple of tweaks, this place could rock.  And I think the owner/manager cares, because why else would he have stopped at every table to check in.  And it was not a fly-by---he actually paused and smiled and made eye contact.  Like I said, I didn't want to be a PITA...  I will definitely try again, because you can't judge on just one experience unless you find something disgusting, and everyone has an off night.  But we still had a great time, so it's all good!

I am so impressed with Dr. Lam and her staff, Kaylie and Chris.  The facilities themselves are so attractive and clean and offer a really nice selection of eyeglasses.  Chris and Kaylie provide wonderful guidance in selecting the right specs to make you feel stylish.  Dr Lam is just lovely---so personable and professional.  She explained everything to me thoroughly, answered all my questions, and really listened to everything I said to make sure that my eyeglasses and contacts fit my needs. I really felt like I was in good hands.  I am so happy that I happened on to Eye Care North and Dr. Lam.  (It's also wonderful to have such a great eye care provider up here near Cave Creek proper!)

We have been clients of Crystal Falls Pool Services since Jan, 2013.  And, woo-hoo!  They are as good as it gets.  The tech never fails to show up as scheduled---we could set a clock by his timely arrival.  Always neatly dressed, courteous---super-nice---and we have had three different guys thru the months.  They take excellent care of our pool---it never smells like chlorine, the water sparkles, it looks great.  Our pool and equipment were almost 19 years old---the tile had been neglected and was all calcified from well water and the equipment was at last gasp.  We had cause to call Crystal Falls a couple of times for repairs and they showed up quickly, understood we were trying to "baby" the system along for a little longer, and always managed to get it back up and performing as well as could be expected for a minimal cost.  When we finally decided to bite the bullet and get the tile re-done and a new salt water system and heater put in, we got three estimates.  Crystal Falls came in with the best price.  When we wanted to add some expensive bells and whistles, they explained to us what would and could work, what would be the most cost-effective----one contractor quoted to completely tear out our pebble-tec coating!  When it came time for the work to be done, as usual, they showed up when they said they would, Edgar rocked out the new tile, they gently sand-blasted our stained pebble-tec so it almost looks new, Jordan did a great job at installing the new equipment, and Mike, the owner, came out and personally worked on hooking up the Aqualink remote stuff.  And when there was a problem because our wireless router wasn't compatible and we couldn't get the iPad linked in, he had an IT guy out here the next day.  It's all good now.  We are so happy with our "new" pool---the new tile looks great, the pebble-tec looks good, the new two-phase equipment is going to save us money, and we can actually heat the spa or pool if we want.  Oh, and the LED lighting---it is so cool.  We love to sit on patio at night and sip wine and play with the light combos!  We can't say enough good things about Crystal Falls or the guys!  Thank you!  We are very happy with your service!

We were regular denizens of Carefree Station and were unhappy when it closed up at Spanish Village.  We watched carefully when Scottsdale Station opened  T-giving weekend and figured we'd give it some time to "find it's legs".  It's not fair to judge a restaurant when it's just opened and working out the kinks.  I figured six weeks is enough.  Experience: well, you remember how you finally get a date with your biggest crush of all times and then it falls flat because he eats like a pig and talked non-stop about himself and his Mom?  Yeah.  Ambiance:  Hasn't the charm and coziness and quirkiness of Carefree Station, but it's a beautiful place.  It's just very Scottsdale---kind of urban and elegant and poised.  Although I do wonder how they are going to keep those neat little chain-draped chandeliers from collecting copious amounts of dust as time goes by.  At least they aren't really over any tables.  Speaking of which, the tables are nicely arranged so that you do enjoy some privacy and you can talk to your dining companions.  Menu: My heart thrilled!  It was--as best I recall---the old CS menu!  All my faves were on it!    Service: we'll discuss that later.  So DH and I order glasses of wine and immediately requested our beloved sushi nachos at the same time.  We LOVE the sushi nachos!    We ordered the roasted beet salad and the spinach salad (btw---Pt Reyes blue cheese is exceptional!) and then DH and I decided to try items we had never had before----usually he gets the Steak Diablo and I love the Shrimp Habanero---so he ordered the Pollo Fundido and I ordered the Korean Shortribs.  First of all---the Quality of Food was Excellent as ever.  DH's Pollo Fundido was fabuloso!  OMG, if I were ever to return, I would consider ordering that dish for sure!  Tender chicken, incredible pastry, delicious sauce.  Wow!  DH would only share one bite!  My Korean Shortribs.  Hmmm.  Well, what came out was on a bed of something tasty and pureed---it was not the miso-mashed potato eggroll the menu promised and there was the merest WHISPER of Asian flavor.  The Asian veggie mix was good.  But it wasn't what I expected---which was a rich mahogany glaze with a bit of sweet and a touch of spice---not necessarily heat.  And you would have to invite me into the kitchen and let me observe the dish being made, because I do NOT believe those were shortribs---at least nothing like any I had.  Basically, it tasted and looked like Yankee pot roast.  A really GOOD pot roast, but pot roast.  I know, because I make pot roast maybe once a month.  This was a hunk of chuck, imho, not shortribs.  But it was good!  But not what I expected or wanted.  Should have stuck with the Shrimp or the Whole Enchilada or the Steak Tampaquena.  I took a couple of bites and then we flagged down our server (Tammy) and I asked her if this was the right dish and she said it was.  She said they were out of the miso-mashed potato eggroll because they make them fresh every morning and they had run out so they subbed..  Ummm....we sat down to dinner at 6 pm when the restaurant was half full----sounds unlikely to me.  Plus, shouldn't you tell the diner when making a substitution?  We never got our sushi nachos.  We realized it wasn't happening when our salads came out.  No nachos.  Then the entrees.  But they were on the bill.  So we told her and she said almost accusingly: well, why didn't you say so?  1) It's not our job to manage the tables; 2) pet peeve: the serving of food out of order and not properly paced.  Also, Tammy, you never came back to the table unless DH waved you down, like when we asked about my dish or he wanted a 2nd glass of wine.  When she brought our bill, she blamed the kitchen and the runners.  Actually, everything that went wrong with the service was someone else's fault, never her's.   I can overlook having too many tables to properly serve, or incompetence, but I have an issue with not being accountable.  Anyhow, I think DH was aggravated enough with her performance he didn't leave her a tip or a very small one---I didn't ask.  He doesn't verbalize like I do---he notes his unhappiness financially.  We got out to the car and we were laughing: OMg---what just happened?    Maybe they are still working things out---I don't know.  I saw Robert and Linda working their tails off, as usual---but sadly, it comes down to it's only good as the people they have working for them.  And there are a lot of restaurants in Scottsdale...  I keep saying I am looking for a place we could love like Carefree Station---I don't think Scottsdale Station is it!  Not a great experience.

Memorial Day weekend, DH located a luxury SUV online that he was interested in.  Despite it being a Sunday, he called and left a vm, figuring he'd get a call back on Tuesday.  Josh called him back with 15 minutes.  Polite, informative---we made arrangements to visit JBA to view and test drive the vehicle.  Arrived JBA with a number in our head.  As advertised, the vehicle was "cherry".  Met with salesperson Jeff, who gladly answered all our questions then sent us off for the test drive on our own, which allowed us to enjoy the vehicle without a hovering salesperson.   Arrived back to start the dickering, DH's favorite part.  He threw a figure out.  Jeff countered with a number within our range. Oh.  Ninety minutes after our arrival at JBA, we are owners of a new SUV.   It had one small issue (we did take over to a dealer to have it checked out, per Judge Judy!) and Jeff wrote the repair into the contract.  When the part came in a couple of days later, I took the vehicle down for the repair.  JBA was sure how long the repair would take, so they sent me home in a loaner.  A few hours later, they had their assistant deliver our repaired and freshly detailed (again!) to Cave Creek so I didn't have to drive back down to Mesa.   Great buying experience, great customer service---we have every intention of making JBA our first stop the next time we are call shopping!

Had dinner at CB last night after a debacle at an establishment across the street.  Such a great experience wanted to update my review and realized I never have reviewed.  Yikes!  Remedying that now.  We have been to Carefree Bistro about five times since it opened and have never had a bad meal.  Always delicious, service great, super energy---probably the reason we don't go more often is we find the dining room quite loud---it's happy chatter, but it's loud.  Now that the patio is open, it's quieter and that will make a difference in our visits, I think.  But last night the patio was full, as was the dining room, but a lovely young woman found us a two-top in the corner.  We were so hungry!  We told our server we had just waited an hour and a half at a nearby restaurant and never got our meals, so please feed us fast!  I love CB's risotto and order it at every opportunity---last night was no exception.  DH ordered the Chicken & Prawns.    Bless his heart---moments after we ordered, our server, Benjamin, brought two bowls of the most delectable cream of broccoli soup to hold us over---complimentary because we were so hungry and weren't having a great experience so far this night.  It was really, really very good.  I can't explain except it just seemed to embody broccoli flavor.  I don't know how the chef made it so intense.  But I have to point out that that gesture did not nothing but make us feel more positive about CB and it's staff than we already were.  I don't know what those soups cost, but emotionally, it made us feel someone cared what kind of evening we were having.  Priceless!  Our entrees were out in about 10 minutes.  I had a three mushroom risotto that was incredible and perfectly cooked---I didn't even allow the server to add parmesan because the seasoning was so perfectly balanced, I didn't want to adjust it with the saltiness of the cheese.  DH said his Chicken & Prawns was very good.  He gave me one of his prawns and it was delicious, hot and succulent and buttery.  Yum!  One of these days if I can pass up the risotto, I am going to try that dish myself.  Oh, and though we did not have an appetizer at CB last night, the tuna tartare and the calamari has been wonderful in the past!  The pizza looks great too---DH always says he is going to try their pizza, then he gets seduced by a entree.  Maybe we will have to go up to lunch one day...I have heard their portobello mushroom sandwich is really good!  Anyhow, as good as the food is, the attention to detail and the incredible hum of energy is probably why Carefree Bistro is always packed.  You just feel cosseted and like you are at a big ol' party all at one time!  Very nice.

We have eaten at the Shea location and it was pretty good, so when returning from a day trip to the south, it seemed like a good idea to exit the 101 and cruise up Pima and pick up Chinese for dinner at the new Pinnacle Peak restaurant.  Not so much.  If it wasn't for some decent hot and sour soup, this would be a 0-1 star rating.  First of all, outrageously priced.  We got one serving of the aforementioned hot and sour soup, a pork lo-mein, and a chicken kung pao.  It was $36.00.  Which we would have bravely swallowed, if the food had been decent.  First---as I said, the hot and sour soup was okay.  Not as good as Dao's, which has set the bar on hot and sour soup in my opinion.  But it was okay.    Pork Lo-Mein.  Omg...really?  The noodles were undercooked, the sauce was tasteless, and it had---I counted, four strips of pork.  I even checked the receipt to see if I had received vegetarian by accident and those pork bits were incidental, but no---it said pork lo-mein.  And it couldn't be vegetarian anyways because there were literally six long green strands of green onions tops and that was it.  Then the tasteless sauce and the chewy-nearly-crunchy-noodles.  DH laughs because I will eat about anything, even while I am complaining, but I just ended up shoving 90% of this into the garbage in disgust.  DH ordered the Kung Pao chicken and asked for it to be spicy.  A slight modification but it seemed to baffle the young lady who took the phone order.  (But I have noticed these kids are not really adaptable these days!)  It took her a minute to get it entered.  So anyhow, DH was no more happy with his meal than I with mine.  One---just one---of those skinny red peppers had been tossed in for the spice, and as DH said, TG for that, because otherwise the whole entree would have been deadly bland.  He just nibbled on the pepper for a couple of bites.  Only a couple of bites, because the two pieces of chicken that were the protein part of the meal were---in his words---"slimy, leftover chicken you forget at the back of the fridge" and so gristle-y that he actually spit back out on the edge of his plate most of what he ate.  (Eww.  That was pleasant to witness.)  What it had in plenty was sliced water chestnuts.  It looked like they had poured the entire can in.  We ended up tossing his entree too and made chocolate chip cookies.  So much for a nutritious dinner---but they were tasty!  Maybe we just hit them on a bad night, but it was nearly $40 of bad, so we won't be running back down there anytime soon.

Drove in with a radar detector tucked in the door pocket.  Was not there after employees finished vacuuming and windows.  Manager belligerant and unhelpful.  Phoenix police wouldn't even take report because we "couldn't prove anything".  This is NOT Happy Harrys.  We'll stick to Quick-n-Clean in Cave Creek, where the vehicle is never out of our sight.  (And yes, it was stupid to leave the detector in the car.  Never again.)

Haven't made it here for any of the live music in the evenings, but have had breakfast and lunch quite a few times and never been less than very happy!  Not to mention countless gallons of coffee, all topped with pretty designs by the baristas.    I am going to say off the bat I have never tried their baked goods.  The scones and muffins and a plate of chocolate chip cookies are all sitting on the counter with customers and counter help breathing and sifting dust and stuff all over them and I think that is ick.  Too bad, because when the place was C4, I loved snagging a scone (from a case!) and a coffee to start my day.  I love a good scone.  But that is the only negative thing I can say.  I debated if I should drop a star because of that, but I don't know if I should visit my germ obsession on such nice people, so I didn't.  (Okay, I am being lenient because I really like this place.)  Otherwise, everyone who works here, including Jonny and Lauren, the owners, are just the nicest, most care-about-your-experience people.  Love their crazy breakfasts---read what the Savory Oatmeal or Power Bowl breakfast is and you are like wha...?  Then you have them and you are like, "Wow".  My only problem is either of those are so filling that I am done eating for the day!  They stoke you up!  Love their lunches.  Have been working my way thru the menu and have not yet had a salad or sandwich that isn't delicious and fresh and usually has a bit of a twist that makes you go: Oh?  and then OH!  But I am already learning what my favorites are, lol!  Never tried their burgers, but I don't eat burgers out.  Unless it's In-and-Out but that's a special case.  Even if most of the tables aren't occupied, there is a constant stream of locals going in and out with to-go coffees and breakfasts and lunches.  It's a busy place, but you always feel like a individual and they are happy you are there.  They welcome you, give you smiles, check in with you and ask sincerely if you are enjoying your food.    The other day at lunch some Moms came in with three or four kindergarten age kids and there was some discussion if there was anything suitable for little kids to eat.  The server heard and came over and I don't know what happened, but she arranged to accommodate little kid tastebuds because when I finished my sandwich and left, moms and kids were chowing down.  I thought that was nice.    Wish them all success, though I don't think they need my good wishes---they are doing great all on their own.  Hope they keep it up!

This dining (not) experience occurred August 22nd.    DH and I went out for dinner. Because it's the Slow Season in Cave Creek, we try to support local restaurants. We were seated in a dining room that was 2/3's empty but had what looked to be about a dozen servers on board. We got water immediately, then sat ignored for 20 minutes. However, we got to watch one server standing at the bar drinking wine, and two servers and a hostess (who later claimed to be the manager) leaning against the wall in the service area chatting. Another handful was standing around the kitchen hanging out, and two very busy servers were racing around tending to their tables. After almost twenty minutes of being ignored, DH and I decided to leave---there ARE other restaurants in Cave Creek-Carefree who would appreciate our patronage.  However, I did stop at the hostess station where two young girls were chatting to ask politely for the manager.  One young girl says: "That's me!"  (I have to admit---I was a bit taken aback---she seemed very young to be in charge of what is obviously a very expensive build-out and her demeanor was more cheerleader than leader, as evinced by the lack of staff supervision and her own gossip-fest back in the service area.)  Nonetheless, I explained to her we had sat at our table apparently in a cloak of invisibility for nearly 20 minutes.  At which she looked at me blankly for about 10 seconds, then said: "Oh.  Sorry about that."  Then she gave me another vacuous smile.  Ooooo-kay.  So DH and I left.  Now, the chef and general manager (so who was the young girl?) did send me an email the next day apologizing for the incident and offering DH and me a gift certificate to try a return visit.  I deleted the email.  This is why: we had parked in the side parking lot between the restaurant and Cave Creek Road.  We had made our reservations through Opentable.com, which is an app that makes your reservations and awards you points when you check-in for your table.  It took us maybe 2 minutes (probably less) to walk out to our vehicle and get in.  As DH backed out of the spot, my phone dinged and I looked at the newest email I had just received.  It was from Opentable.com, saying our reservations at Indigo Crow had been cancelled.  And that's when I got really aggravated.  We couldn't order a libation or get a menu in 20 minutes, but within 3 minutes the little manager-girl made sure the 50 points we got for checking in was taken away.  That was a bit much.  Yes, fine, we didn't eat there so did not earn the points, but she could have at least waited for as many minutes as we waited for service in a mostly empty and well-staffed restaurant.  Since then, I of course talked about my experience and found that a lot of locals have not been happy with the service and sometimes the food, though mostly the service.  So I guess they are planning to survive on tourist and Scottsdale trade. And Happy Hour.  A few people said they do a nice Happy Hour, but they don't *dine* there. It's a real shame; beautiful restaurant and according to Yelps, the food can be quite good.  But there's too many restaurants of this caliber in the area----for $70+ a person, I want a guarantee of service and good food and not aggravation.  I'd be a lot more likely to give them a second chance if they were one of the rare moderately priced establishments.

We had high hopes.  A restaurant just down the road that serves both Italian (DH's fave) and Mexican (mine) and is in the cool, funky space that used to be occupied by Carefree Station? Very cool.  Just to set the stage, DH and I were starving after a busy day and we decided to eat early (for us).  We got to Guido Garcia's just before seven.  We were seated in the outdoor patio area---as cute and comfy as when it was CS.  DH was facing toward the kitchen/bar, I was facing out at the patio and the other tables---four of which were occupied, so we made five.  Interestingly, there was a problem at a table near us---one of the customers was complaining.  Her voice was low and I couldn't hear the exact nature of the complaint, but the server's voice was higher pitch and she was apologizing up and down for something.  Anyhow...  We only got one dish---the bruschetta.  It was great.  A little under-seasoned, but I actually prefer to salt my food to taste, because some chefs go waaay over board.  Baguette it was served on had a great flavor.  I would totally order it again.  Probably our first mistake was not ordering appetizer and entree at once, but DH can't stand when our meal shows up before we finished our entree.  We ordered the bruschetta as our starter.  It took about twenty minutes to arrive...we were enjoying our wine and the beautiful evening, but we were pretty hungry and we were just starting to get impatient when the runner brought it out.  Like I said, it was really good, but basically, bruschetta is a pre-prepared tomato topping on toasted bread.  Nearly twenty minutes?  So we wanted to order our meals right away, but we had to wait for our server to come back.  DH said it looked like he was serving drinks behind the bar.  Anyhow, we were done with our appy and our wine when he reappeared to take our order.  I ordered the pork belly tacos and DH ordered the prime rib tacos---I was kind of surprised he didn't go for the Italian, but DH said they sounded good.  And the menu descriptions did make them sound great.  And yes, I am looking at my watch now!  It was about 8 pm.  But we didn't get to try them because after thirty-five minutes of waiting for our meals, we paid our bill and walked out.  This was when the server came out and told us it was going to be a longer, the kitchen was really backed up.  Seriously?  Facing the kitchen/bar, DH had already commented it just looked like a bunch of servers milling around or feeding drinks to three people at the bar and that a guy we assume is an owner or manager was emptying the dishwasher of glasses.  He didn't see any food coming out of the kitchen.  I looked past him at the patio and said that explained why no one had food on their tables.  So when our server said it was going to be longer---well.  DH suggested we just go over to DQ and grab a chicken sandwich---I mean, at this point, despite the tasty bruschetta, we were ready to chew on the palm tree next to our table.  (Actually, we ended up going across the street to another dining establishment).  So here's my thoughts.  Guido Garcia's front and back of house management really needs to pick it up.  The owner/manager should have been out in the dining area smiling and apologizing and just "hosting" instead of hiding in the bar area with a rack of glasses.  That would have gone a long way if somebody with a smile had come out and said, "Folks, I am sorry things are a bit slow, we are still getting it together and we appreciate your patience."  Instead, I felt like a rack of clean glasses was more important than we were.  And someone needs to get the kitchen organized.  Nothing that DH and I ordered was not mostly of components that were not already chopped or prepped.  Who's leading the kitchen?  Look at the place across the street from GG's---Carefree-Cave Creek is ready to embrace new restaurants, but you got to meet our expectations.  Good food served hot and within a reasonable amount of time.  This hopefully is just growing pains and they will get it together, and we'll probably try GG's in a few months.  If service hasn't improved, then I don't know if they are going to make it, and that would be sad, because you can see the potential.

Okay, GG's has done a complete 180 from our original experience a few weeks ago.    A damp and chilly night, we eschewed the patio for a table inside. Definitely a rustic cantina/cucina  thing going on---very simple decor, but either lights or walls gave it a nice golden, cozy glow that was pleasant on an icky night.  But given the right weather, choose the charming patio on which to dine.  A very nice young man appeared the moment we stepped across the threshold; not only was he the host, but also our server.  I believe his name is Chance.  We sat, perused the wine list, and DH ordered a cab and I went with a Coppola Syrah as they didn't have my beloved Pinot Noir by the glass----it was very good!    After the timing issues our first visit, I had my eyes on my watch. We had our glasses of wine before us within 6 minutes of ordering.  When our server dropped off our libations, we ordered our appy---the Caprese-in-a-Jar.  That showed up in eight minutes, and that's when we gave our entree orders, after expressing to Chance concern that our meals would arrive while we were still enjoying the first course---he guaranteed us this would not happen.  This is true.  Just as we were finishing off the appetizer, he arrived with our entrees, hot and fresh.  I don't know how long that took from ordering, but it doesn't matter because the meals arrived at exactly the right time.  Okay---enough about time---suffice to say service was well within acceptable limits.  Now about the food.  Appetizer: Caprese-in-a-Jar.  Cute presentation----little glass pitcher layered with  bocconcini and tomatoes.  Slices of good crusty bread toasted, then scattered with shredded parm, laid out on a big wooden platter.  DH and I weren't sure what to do---we'd never had "caprese-in-a-jar".  Tried forking the mixture out of the jar, but the neck was a bit narrow---finally DH dumped the whole thing onto the bread platter and then we scooped.  It was very good, the tomatoes had a nice, fresh flavor and perfect texture and the mix of herbs and oil was spot on---nice bite of garlic.  We did have to salt and pepper. Maybe a pinch of crushed red pepper and just a smidge more salt?  But otherwise very tasty.  I still am not sure if pouring the mixture out on the platter was gauche---maybe if that's what is intended, the server could say so.  If not, then a wider mouth jar would be better.  DH's Entree: Chrissy's Red Enchilada.  DH took  first bite---then another---then looked at me and said: "Fan-Tas-Tic!"  So I sent my fork flying his way.  And it was super good.  I am not a ground beef girl, but I would order this.  Delicious!  REALLY delicious.  My entree: Amazing Pork Belly Tacos.  Menu calls them amazing---and I agree.  Pork belly was succulent,  accouterments crisp and fresh---loved the bite of goat cheese.  Actually, I really loved it because that meant DH, who doesn't like goat cheese, wouldn't try my tacos so I didn't have to share.  Hah!  But three was A LOT!  I brought one home!  (Yay!)  Hmm----I just looked at the online menu and it said it was cojita---but I swear was goat cheese.  Anyhow, it was EXCELLENT!  I was sad when I could not finished that third taco, Though it meant I had today's breakfast or lunch.  It was so good I wanted to really go for the glutton thing, but my tummy let me down.  Sides: Black beans were perfect---they had the look and texture of from scratch beans---and were tender, meaning the chef did NOT salt until they had cooked, which is a good thing because not only does that not inhibit that nice bean-y creaminess, but it reduces the bean-y side effects.  Lightly seasoned and very simple---making a tasty counterpoint to the bright and complex flavors of our entrees.  The Mexican Rice, however---that was a fail. Okay, I don't like Mexican Rice. But besides being what I call "Rice-A-Roni" Mexican Rice (this is not to imply GG's did not make their rice from scratch, just what that kind of style of rice reminds me of), it was also mushy.  Not good.  Our lovely server agreed there are some rice issues.  Since I'm not a rice person anyway, in the future, I would probably nix the rice and ask for doubles of those wonderful beans.  And our server was GREAT.  He was enthusiastic and knowledgeable and he seemed to really care that we enjoyed our meal.  It appears that the "dishwasher guy" and our previous server have moved on, to the benefit of GG's.  So, having made our second visit with some misgivings but believing everyone gets a second chance, we found that Guido Garcia's really knocked it out of the park with food and service.  DH actually said this morning he can't wait to go back to try the Italian menu.  Fingers crossed that last night is their standard and not an anomaly, and we will so become regulars.  But right now, we are fans!

Another excellent meal at GG's!  It's like one of Carefree's best kept secrets, tucked back in Spanish Village.  The signage isn't great, but it's worth looking for.  There's two ways in----a small arched doorway by Desert Treasures Gift Shop and a larger arched gateway that says "Spanish Village" above it.  The patio was perfect last night. Fairy lights were twinkling, soft warm breeze----sadly, DH wanted to eat inside!  (He'd been outside all day at Horseshoe Lake and I think he wanted some wall time)  Anyhow, I have to admit we were so happy with our meals last time we stayed on that same path and had the pork belly tacos and Chrissy's red enchilada again!  Just as good last time---and so much food!  I definitely have lunch for today and probably tomorrow!  (After all his activity at the lake, DH had no prob snarfing the whole enchilada!)  We did try the Buttermilk Salad--we split between us and the greens were fresh and the dressing EXCELLENT!  (I'd like to have the recipe!)  We had a different server than last time--this time was Scott.  He was great.  Prompt, personable.  Our food came out hot (or cool re the salad!) and in a timely manenr.  He kept my iced tea topped off as well as DH's wine.  I swear, we eventually are going to try the Italian menu---I just can't get past the tacos!  And someone told me they have a super Happy Hour from 3-6 pm.  I could hang on the patio for a few hours, no problem!

I don't like to layer review on review for a single establishment (I seem like a plant!) and I don't like handing out 5-stars either.  Nonetheless, I'm countering a recent review of GG's that said "worst Mexican ever",  I think that was a bit over-kill.  But I recognize everyone has different tastes---some people think Taco Bell is "best Mexican ever".    So Tuesday night, we took friends from out of town to Guido's.  I had my pork belly tacos, DH had the red enchiladas, one friend had the creamy white enchiladas and the fourth had the red & green lasagna.  It was all so good!  (The black beans---omgosh!  Delish!)  Our friends, who are from Tampa and don't cook so they eat out all the time, raved.  We were waited on by Scott and he was great.  The storms of the morning had blown out, so it was just a lovely night and a good time was had by all.  Fast forward to Saturday night.  Hiked Spur Cross, explored Cave Creek and Carefree, went out to Bartlett Lake for the sunset.  Coming home, we gave our guests a choice of restaurants---there's a lot of good restaurants in Carefree and Cave Creek.  They wanted to return to GG's.  Really?  We just ate there.  Wouldn't you like to try *** or ***?  Nope, Guido's, please.  So we returned.    Sat on the patio, was waited on by the owner, Chris, who managed to be warm and friendy and serve us and the other upper patio tables promptly and professionally.  This time, the table ordered the guac and salsa and chip, which was enjoyed by the guys---although I had a house salad with some of that wonderful buttermilk ranch dressing---followed by: red & green lasagna, GG's lasagna, and another round of creamy white enchilada for the other two.  Excellent!  My GG's lasagna was quite good, although I regretted I didn't order my favorite pork belly tacos and black beans---just that I LOVE them.  DH said he thought his Italian was as good as the red enchiladas he usually orders and our friends chowed their Mexican.  I was the only who had leftovers!  (Ahouldn't have had the salad, but that b-milk dressing is so good!)  The at Crhis's urging, we shared among us a bowl of spumoni to finish  That won't happen again.  Next time, everyone gets their own bowl.  It was really good ice cream.  A great cap to a delicious meal.  So, we think GG's is really good for food, service and ambiance and recommend!

Fried Chicken Skin Po Boys.  Pork Belly.  Fried Cauliflower.  Wow.  I hate cauliflower.  I wouldn't have eaten every bit they put in front of me.  Incredibly good!  Unique menu, delicious food, charming guys....what a great place for lunch!  Wish it was handier to Cave Creek...but maybe for the best.  I would be a permanent fixture!

Ambiance: yuck.  Food: yuck.  Only gave Two stars because there was some effort at customer service.
