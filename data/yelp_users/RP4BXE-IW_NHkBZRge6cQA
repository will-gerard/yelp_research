If Kurt Cobain had been here in the summer time, he would have sang "Smells Like Athlete's Foot." Thank goodness, he lived in the Northwest.  This 24-Hour Fitness, especially the men's locker room, is disgusting. I took a shower once after a good workout and I had to count the years from my last tetanus shot. Filthy, shaky, rusty partitions in the shower.   The rest of the gym has an "I love the 80's" vibe. It's one pastel short of a Richard Simmons' color scheme. There were gym rats who perspire so much at stationary bikes that sweat drips from the machine and forms a pool on the floor. If you have an over-active sweat glands, please have the courtesy to wipe.   Worst of all, on my fourth (and last) visit, a petty thief broke my locker and stole all my cash. I reported the incident, filled up a form, and got valuable advice: "Don't use combination lock, it's easy to break."   Ummm...really? When some gym members have bolt cutters instead of fitness gloves, it's time to move on to a different gym.

There's no better way to have your first Bosnian cuisine than having a true-blooded Bosnian for company. He speaks the language, ordered for us, and knows if the food is authentic and not watered-down for the American palette.   WHY GO THERE?  My Bosnian friend gave this restaurant the thumbs-up seal of approval. The food is  good, he had a box to go for the next day.  WHATCHAGOT?  For starters, we ditched the hearty soup and went for bread. We had all three pitas: meat, cheese and spinach. While each was delicious and warmed up, it would have been better to have them early in the day when they're made fresh. Traditionally, you grab the end by hand and uncoil the bread, as you work your way to the center. Best shared.   The cevapi is filling. I find the large too much, I could have settled for a medium or small. I asked about the raw onions. My friend said it is a cure for everything. Have an ailment, eat the raw onion! I guess it's apples for Americans, onions for Bosnians!  We wrapped dinner with an addictively sweet and delicious tulumbe. Better than baklava!  YOU GOT SERVED. Service is quick and friendly, but in a take-your-time-when-you're-ready-to-order kind of way. I like it better than the methodical service of chain restaurants. Overall, the Turkish and Greek influences are very much present in Bosnian cuisine. If you like Turkish, you'd like Bosnian food. Geez, that sounds like the perfume ad of the 80's.

This place was highly recommended by a Seattle friend who had lived in Phoenix for years. I was desperately looking for a weekend breakfast place after a month living in the valley.   WHY GO THERE? My friend's exact words were: "I'm about to change your life. Tomorrow go to Dick's Hideaway on 16th and Bethany Home. And it doesn't stand for what you think it does. There's no sign so look up the address. Be prepared to wait or eat at the bar. No bullshit the best breakfast place if not restaurant in the world."  He wasn't  kidding when he said no business sign out the building. We almost missed the place, but it's worth the second drive around the block.  WHATCHAGOT? I got the Tenderloin Benedict, which is not cheap for a breakfast entree, but all worth it. My companion had the Huevos Rancheros. I love protein in my breakfast. Remember when they say breakfast is the most important meal of the day? At Dick's Hideaway, it's the truth!  YOU GOT SERVED. Service is quick and friendly. Water is brought out as soon as you're seated. The food is hot, and so is the metal plate it's on.   I'm glad to find this hidden gem. Dick, whoever you are, you can come out of hiding.

Of all the 24 Hour Fitness I've been to in Phoenix (this, Camelback and Bell Rd), this gym is the cleanest and with better equipment.  Camelback location is a rat hole. It's  dirty, stinky, and frequented by sweaty meatheads who doesn't rerack weights and plates. Worst of all, my locker was broken into and money stolen.  The Bell Rd location is better than Camelback, however not as clean as the Metro Parkway location.

I've been checking out gyms after my 24 Hour Fitness membership expired. I was reluctant to renew it.  With my three-day trial pass on hand, I went to  LA Fitness. It is in a convenient area, smack in Camelback, with a very promising space.   Convenient is centrally located with ample parking, however, that's not what makes a good gym. Promising is when, at first glance, the workout space extends all the way back like a long bowling alley with lots of machines. Upon closer look, some machines were dirty, others vandalized, most had seen better days.  After a warm up on an elliptical which handle bars were stickier than honey dried in an afternoon sun, I went for chest machines. I did three sets of seated fly only to notice that per visual diagram I did  "_ _ ATE_  FLY". I felt compelled to wash my hands.   Promising is a locker room, clean and bright, where you can wash off the built up of sweat and grime on your hand. Reality is a wash room that is more like a petri dish for new drug resistant strain of flesh-eating bacteria just waiting to make the giant leap from dirty floor to human skin.   If you're a bacteria, this gym is convenient and promising. Three-day trial pass not required. If you're human, get a pass before joining. Maybe I was there on a bad day.  As for the lady working at the front desk? She was staring blankly outside waiting for redemption when her shift is over. I didn't bother to discuss membership options.

Halfway through my meal, I wondered if the Arrogant Butcher is authentic and real as the Grouchy Chef of Mukilteo or the Soupman (Soup Nazi) of Hell's Kitchen.  There's something about bad behavior accepted widely in restaurants. Disappointingly, an arrogant butcher is a concept, not a reality.  WHY GO THERE? Good selection of comfort food in a hip industrial space. On a nice day, outside seating means people watching.  WHATCHAGOT? I enjoyed the Turkey Pastrami served in a pretzel bun. It's a marriage made in split-personality heaven: turkey meets pastrami, pretzel meets bun.  Crispy rock shrimp is great tasting appetizer. On Mondays, I like the special meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Good selection of cocktails.  YOU GOT SERVED. Water doesn't go dry.  Service is attentive. There's nothing arrogant about this place.
