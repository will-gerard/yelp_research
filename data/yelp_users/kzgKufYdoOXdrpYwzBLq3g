I have used this shop for a few years, but I have to admit I am not happy with their service right now, I had a Hayward vacuum that they fixed twice under warranty, and the same thing broke again - instead of perhaps considering I just got a bad vacuum I was told I had excessive use???? Really - how exactly does one use a pool vacuum too much?  I don't run it 24/7, its a small play pool and the vacuum is less than 2 years old.  Now they want me to pay over $200 and to be honest they weren't very nice about it either.  I don't think I will go back here.

I wanted to follow up - I figured I would give these guys another try so I called the Pool shop again, to find out about getting the sand in our filter re-done & the owner said "you wrote a bad review about us on yelp so we won't work with you".  I was actually surprised - rather than take the opportunity to  earn my trust back they chose to lose out on potential business.  My husband actually figured out how to change the sand himself - saving us a bunch of money.

I was a little apprehensive at first, the soup and salad weren't great, but it was such a fun place and the food for the main course was excellent. I had shrimp that was so tender and flavorful and my husband loved his steak.  Our chef  Brandon was amazing, it was a blast to watch him flip food and the cooking utensils. I will definitely come here again.

LOVE LOVE LOVE my amazing backyard thanks to legacy.  Friendly and professional they did a beautiful job and the turf is holding up really well, even with 3 big dogs.  The turf does get hot in the summer, but hey this is AZ so everything gets hot, and a quick spray with the hose cools it off just fine.  I spend so much more time in my yard now.  These guys were honest and very quick.

If you need to go to an Emergency room DON'T GO HERE!  It was awful, my daughter was hit by some roof tiles during the storm, although we got in to see a doctor pretty quickly, he spent less than 2 minutes with us and ordered and xray and CT.  They called my daughter for an xray about 30 minutes later, then we sat for over 3 hours while no one checked on us at all.  The room was filthy.  When we finally asked - they admitted it would be another 4-5 hours before we could get a CT, and no one had even read the xrays yet.  They told us the doctor might see us again in 2 or 3 hours.  No one had any answers.  At that point is we had been there 4 and a half hours, it was after 1:00 in the morning so we decided to just leave.  It was crowded and awful, I would avoid going here ever again.

I needed flowers for my brother & sister in law, but had no idea what I wanted and Flowers By Renee delivered a beautiful arrangement.  Staff was friendly and helpful, the flowers were gorgeous.  I would recommend these guys to anyone.

Wow - the food was fantastic - my daughter was so excited that the veggie burger was Vegan, and it was incredible.  The atmosphere was wonderful - lots of comfortable outside eating areas.  The only downside was a long line, but it was worth the wait.

Great place to come and watch the games on Sunday - my bf is a huge packer fan and there are lots of fellow packers in their green & gold.  Food is good, really nice servers and a fun atmosphere - most of all the price is good too.

Had sushi with my daughter and it was a fun experience, not too expenisve and the sushi was pretty good.  The conveyor belt makes it fun - just grab what you want.  The price is very reasonable, one downside is the tendancy to want to make your stack of plates as high as possible, leading to some over eating, but all in all a great place to visit.

I needed a key for my house, called Gabriel and he made plans to come over and give me an estimate as soon as he finished with his current client.  He was friendly & professional and did a great job.  He worked so quickly and in no time I was all set.  I would recommend Gabriel to anyone who needs a lock or key.

Wow - what incredible food.  My husband surprised me with concert tickets and we came here for a pre-concert dinner before heading over to Comerica theatre. We started with the highly recommended pretzel fondue and it was fabulous.  My husband had steak and scallops and he raved about his meal, especially the horseradish sauce.  I had a filet and crab and it was incredible, so tender and perfectly cooked.  It came with the most amazing creamed spinach.  We finished our meal with the salted carmel pudding and I can honestly say that I have never had better pudding - it was simply delicious.  They do have a nice outside patio area but in August it was still too hot to enjoy the outside seating.  I will definitely come back, the Arrogant Butcher was fantastic.

Really nice place to spend an evening with good friends, the bruschetta was wonderful, the service friendly and courteous and the atmosphere was really nice, with live music that was not too loud and quite lovely.  They have a really nice wine list with a variety of reds and whites at various price points from moderate to pricey.  I will definitely come here again.

Before you book with that LOW price let me warn you that you get what you pay for.....PLEASE avoid flying on Allegiant airlines, there is an extra charge for literally everything, and then our flight home was cancelled and after waiting on the phone for over 40 minutes they offered no help at all and we were told there are no flights today :( Yeah so....lesson learned #NeverFlyAllegiant

I can't share enough about how great these guys are, my car seized up and I was sure it had some pretty major damage, at first they found a cracked radiator and water in the engine, it looked like a cracked head gasket and we thought it was going to be $3500 in repair, but they called and said it was only a broken water pump, costing us thousands less.  We wouldn't have known the difference but they were so honest and looking out for our best interest.  We have used this shop for a few years and I am so glad we used them this time.  They are always friendly, always honest and willing to help, This shop is the best.

although it was a little pricey, this was the best meal I have had in a long time.  I got a simple shepherd's pie and it was perfect, my fianc√© got the steak and I kept teasing him about having a foodgasm.  They had an amazing variety of beer & wine and the staff was friendly, really loved it and would totally go there again.

Wow, our cake was beautiful and our guests just loved the mini cakes.  We got pineapple and strawberry to go with our tropical beach theme and they were delicious.  Chelsea was so sweet and came up with such a fantastic and creative design, it was stunning.  I highly recommend Iced for Life to anyone who needs a cake

We stopped for a quick bite and the food was amazing, much better than we expected.  My husband ordered the scallop risotto and he was thrilled, said it was the best risotto he has ever had.  Happy hours prices were good and service was great.  I hope this place stays around a long time.

Marc did a great job, he repaired a couple tiles that had come loose and cleaned all the tiles so they look like new.
