Can't say enough good about this place.  Boyfriend introduced the Pork Shop to me about a year ago when he prepared their stuffed pork loin for dinner. I was blown away and have been hooked ever since.  From the moment you exit your car in the parking lot, the delicious aroma of their smoked meats and fresh pulled pork barbecue starts the mouth watering.  Especially good are their freshly-made brats in a variety of flavors such as Green chile, cheese, jalapeno and Fat-tire beer brats.  Try the bacon...leanest I've ever prepared and their butcher-case selection of fresh pork cannot be beat!  We are so fortunate to have this little gem right here in San Tan Valley!!

The Landmark used to be such a great place for a special dinner out...what happened!!  Visited here on 01\12\13 with boyfriend and his father from out of town and have to say I was embarrassed at the decline in the quality of the food and ambiance at this restaurant.  Even though this restaurant is located in a cool historic building, I would have call the decor "early nursing home".  From the faded, torn and worn carpeting; to the cheesy Muzak playing over the sound system, even the smell reminded me of visiting Grandma. Some updating is definitely in order.  The prime rib I ordered was done well, but came out cold and the quality of the cut was sub par for the price being charged.  Boyfriend's stuffed meatloaf was also a disappointment, and the obviously instant mashed potatoes on his plate were the stuff of only the finest school cafeteria fare.  The Salad Room is probably the safest bet with a large selection of items to choose from including soups and desserts.  One saving grace was the service.  Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant and right there when needed.  The Landmark is clearly relying on the name it made for itself in past years to draw people in.  If you go stick to the Salad Room.

Been here many times, and consider it one of the best local places for an authentic Philly cheesesteak.  The Original is always a good bet with delicious combination of melt in your mouth meat, grilled onion and white american cheese, not to mention the bread with just the right amount of chewiness and softness to soak up the juices and not fall apart.    Will keep going back, again and again.  Good job guys!!

Yay Philly cheesesteaks!  Been craving it all day!  Go to place locally for an authentic Philly cheese steak or hoagie.  02/01/13.  Back for the second weekend in a row.  Wish I was on this side of town more often.  Tried the Italian Cheesesteak this time and was not disappointed.  Made-to-order piping hot, quality steak with grilled onions and provolone cheese .  No surprise that this place is always busy.  If you haven't been yet, you've gotta try it if you're in the area.

Little hole in the wall place in San Tan Valley that serves up great food.    I am especially a fan of their awesome gyros!!  Stuffed full of meat, onions, tomatoes and covered in tzaziki sauce...yummy!!  The Greek Fries with feta cheese and greek dressing are very good as well.  You won't leave hungry.

Always a fan of Walt's Favorite Fried Shrimp and the cheddar biscuits!  Will say that this particular location was cleaner than most of the Red Lobster's I have been to.  The food came out quickly and was piping hot and our server, Rico was attentive and friendly.  No complaints here.

I will admit that I am fairly new to sushi so my frame of reference for "good sushi" is somewhat limited; however, I do understand freshness and quality and Sushi Creek nails it, consistently.  My absolute favorite is the tuna nigiri. Melt-in-your-mouth tender and delicious, a must-try with the snapper a close second.  If your a fan of rolls then the Spicy Scallop Roll is a good one to try here.  There are plenty of choices for those who don't eat sushi too.  Decent burgers, flavorful teriyaki as well as a selection from the daily specials board.  Service on weekend days can be a tad slow at times, but the atmosphere is casual and comfortable and you never feel rushed.

Great sushi, but get here early on Friday if you want to take advantage of happy hour pricing.  Here on 02/08/13 with BF and his sister. Along with our perennial favorites, tuna nigiri and the jalapeno tempura roll, we ordered the The Nutty Professor roll with spicy tuna, avocado, cucumber topped with macadamia nuts.  Very fresh and flavorful and the nuts added a nice crunch to the texture of the roll.  Also tried a sampler platter of sashimi which included octopus, salmon, eel, yellow-tail, red snapper, crab and shrimp.  As usual, all very fresh and good. Keep up the good work Sushi Creek!

Lazy Sunday evening of T.V. and we decided try this place for a little takeout.  Typical order at the counter, no frills Chinese take-out joint, with a few small tables in the lobby.  I ordered the rice noodles with Chicken.  Food was hot and fresh but really nothing special, actually could have used more chicken and more vegetables would be a big improvement.  BF had the Orange Chicken and the Hot and Sour soup.  Both of these items are indicated as spicy on menu but were not even close, even bordering on bland.  Perhaps they are catering to their customer base, although this has not been my experience with other Chinese restaurants in the area.    Service was quick, food was hot, price was reasonable, but on the whole, just ho-hum.  Plenty of other Chinese places to choose from, so probably would not go back.

Went for dinner on 2/1/13.  Not many new restaurants open here in Queen Creek so we looked forward to something different.  We were greatly disappointed.  We were greeted by a friendly young man who took our order at the counter, which we had to repeat a couple of times because he was apparently distracted. After he had totaled our bill, I asked about the availability of greens.  He said they did in fact have them available and then proceeded to close our tab, not even bothering to ask if I wanted to add them, same response to BF's inquiry about mac n cheese.  We both ordered fried catfish dinners which came with "critters", Hanzy's version of jazzed up hushpuppies and choice of 2 sides.  Between us we chose fries, potato salad and coleslaw.  My BF placed an order for 6 of their spicy wings.  As instructed, we proceeded to a table to await our food.  And wait we did. It took a good half hour before our orders arrived. Considering we were one of only 3 tables of customers when we arrived, this was an excessive amount of time. Fries were cold, "critters" were cold, chicken wings were missing and when they did arrive, were not spicy.  The catfish was hot and fresh, however, the three small pieces were mostly cornmeal breading (see pic), certainly not worth the $40  price charged.  We ended up leaving most of our meal on the plate.  If things don't drastically change, I don't see this restaurant being around in another couple of months.  I would not recommend this business.

08/29/13  Had the Avocado Smashburger. No complaints here. Burger came out hot and juicy with lots of fresh avocado and flavorful bacon. Fries were thin and crispy and the order was generous. I thought prices were reasonable. This is a welcome and much needed addition to the choices available in the Queen Creek/San Tan Valley area. Friendly and attentive service too. I will definitely come back.
