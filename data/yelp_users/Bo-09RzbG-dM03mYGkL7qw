I rarely ever make a review. But this last visit to this place was so horrible, It made me want to post this. Walked in and ordered a 'fried chicken sandwich'. It's basically two fried chicken patties and some sauce as well as some pickles. Sounds delicious right? Sounds so hard to screw up right?   Well it was disgusting. The bread was soaked in some sauce that was so diluted it made my sandwich look like it was dipped in water.  The pickles? The pickles were disgusting. They were sweet pickles. Worst combination for a chicken sandwich.   The chicken? The breeding was so thick, it would be been better to wrap the chicken in tortilla bread next time   The 'sauce'? So watered down you wouldn't need s water with your food.

Definitely the best coffee I have ever had. They also have amazing smoothies, frosts, and energy drinks. The best coffee drink definitely has to be the caramelizer. If you don't want coffee, try the strawberry white chocolate frost
