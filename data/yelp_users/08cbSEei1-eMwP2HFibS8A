This is a popular western themed restaurant serving mounds of fried food, pineapples filled with coleslaw, fries older than time, decibel blowout,  too loud for conversation, but beautiful views....the platter meal is 21.95 per person and we decided to pass on it as it was dark fried food....My $14.95 burger consisted of salad, drenched in dressing and croutons, fries were so wrinkled and cold, they were inedible.  The waiter will charge you if you want a substitute food!!!   The burger meat was dry and underwhelming for that price!   Others at the table ordered fried chicken, white meat, for $16.95.  The chicken breast was massive,  dry and rubbery.  Included were mushy vegetables, that were unrecognizable.   The place seems worn out and dirty.  A western band took up the rest of the sound in an already chaotic place.  The restrooms were small for such a gigantic place, two seats and the air was hot for some reason...parking down a hill, not OK!  Please don't waste your money as it was extremely disappointing.

Jim was incredible and he had my Honda Odyssey, looking like new , and it was done in a day,  by the nicest, friendliest guy ever!  The price was right and I had fun talking about junkyards, pick a part places, which still exist!!!  The final result was a work of art!

I ate at On The Border which is NOT my favorite Mexican Restaurant by any means. I ordered the Carne Asada which was underwhelming accompanied by a 1/2 cup of veggies and rice and we waited jtoo long for the salad as I had to remind them about it! , what saved this restaurant experiencecwas our sweet, wonderful, polite, delightful waiter NOAH!  What a peach of a guy, who let's the ladies order first and should be grabbed by a PR firm  because this guy has IT!...We had a few other kinks in our food order and timing.  Then the manager came out, whose name I missed, and brought us whatever we wanted and gave us 2 desserts and really cared about us....never was treated so right!  So Cheryl, Vanessa, Dan, Mike, Jason and Hayley send our thanks and we will come back just to see you 2 guys!!  Noah should be the CEO of On The Border!

The service was outstanding BUT The menu is new, prices are high, for a mediocre, turkey lunchmeat sandwich with a salad and a green chili burger with a green salad.  We added sweet potato fries and ice teas, almost $40 bucks.... It's a frigging sandwich shop.  What gives here?  For quite sometime, I have not been willing to go through the obstacle course of "cones" on Gilbert Rd.  But I braved it tonight because I missed "Spinach Wheel Got To Go Round" salad!!!  The salad has been changed and it was missing the spicy chili pecans and the hot bacon dressing, SO a half salad and half sandwich is $12.50, are you serious???  I will not be returning.  it's just not special anymore, baguettes are blah, the salad missing ingredients, lunchmeat and a tiny burger?  The fries were good but extra.     An exorbitant bill...and extreme disappointment!  You lost a faithful customer

I ordered a light Schnitzel dish covered with onions, a potato dumpling and Sauerkraut.  There were no salads or vegetables available, which limits the presentation and color of the meal.    However, it is authentic German Food probably from the day when there was no refrigeration.  Or everything was pickled, made from basic supplies like flour, salt, bread etc.      Food that the Germans ate "pre refrigeration" era.  I really missed vegetables and salad.  They serve beer and wine but can't comment on it as I didn't order any.  My date ordered a pork special for $8.00 with the same side choices:  sauerkraut/red cabbage and five different potato or schpatzel choices.    My schnitzel was very bland, other than a light crust, it was not seasoned.  I tasted the pork dish, that was cooked like a pot roast, but without the vegetables. It tasted good but had gravy all over it.  There were many older customers who seemed to reminisce about Germany.  The service was slow for a Monday night!

I  walked around yesterday at AT and was extremely disappointed.  It again looks trashy, junky and no better than a bad thrift store!  I started shopping there at least 10 years ago but my visits have become farther and farther apart as the years have gone by!  Gone are the wheelers and dealers that made their junk at least presentable and reasonable...but left long ago!  Who wants to see the same crap 6 months later??? Come on, people):  Most booths have no theme, no presentation and management needs to help with merchandising and fair pricing!  I am bypassing this junk hole and heading to 7th Ave and Cave Creek Rd for attractive displays, reasonable prices and fun decor!  Take it from me , Antique Trove, you need a management and dealer overhaul!!! I can't believe you tolerate this after opening your Roseville, CA location that is 10x better!

0 Stars...stayed here long ago and nothing has changed, except the hotel is now filthy, with visible dust on the floors, blood splatter on the nightstand and lamp, spots on the carpet and chairs, a view of AC units out the window, dust and rust on the ac unit...(Legionaires disease, anyone??)  Bill,the desk guy, changes our room to more of the same disgusting mess...and he also tells me there is a high turnover...oops!!! The operations lady yells at me for sanitizing the surfaces and not leaving the blood for her to see....Bill tells me no one complains.  Oh really, Bill?  People have mentioned, bed bugs on Yelp!!  Fiesta is a pet friendly hotel but I'm paying an extra $50 for a filthy, substandard pet room.  I wouldn't leave my dog at a filthy pet hotel...why should any human be treated like that??   I am appalled .  Patrick, the manager, is a robotic,automitom...with no emotion or a  resolution!!!  He said " I'm sorry" 10x  like he was bored...R2D2 has more personality. ..It was so late I couldn't change rooms again and I writhe in dread of catching a disease in this dump...cutting my 4 days here short and going elsewhere, such a frigging hassle too...STAY FAR AWAY...

Tonight I spent $60 on an absolutely underwhelming meal.  It started with blase egg drop soup, greasy spring rolls, just average chicken dishes with dry rice! And the food was lukewarm.  This the second time, a PF Chang, has served us a mediocre quality of food..I can go to the neighborhood Chinese Buffet and have a much better meal for half the price.   Since we were in Las Vegas, visiting, and there are thousands of restaurants, I was surprised at how robotic the waiter was and how below average, greasy and tasteless the food was.  I wish I had my $60 back!!  Advice:  Save your money, or go to your neighborhood Chinese joint!  There is no justification for charging those prices and delivering a crappy experience....Very upset and disappointed.

Home Depot doesnt care about the "little guy"anymore who stayed faithful throughout the recession.  Now they are too busy, as Queen Creek is adding thousands of homes.   I just dropped my $4500 counter project, too many extras, they charge you if you sneeze. But the part that made me really drop the project was when I had to schedule the backsplash work seperately, which was fine.    UNTIL  The rudest, "B" of a woman, who claimed to be some manager, in essence told me, something totally opposite of what other workers had said and it made me feel like an insignificant  speck.   "My business was unimportant and they will get out when they are ready to measure the backsplash and forget about it being done by Thanksgiving." So the countertop would be in but the walls torn up until they can get to it, even though I am planning way ahead.  I was absolutely floored by that attitude,  so I cancelled the project and closed my credit card account, which they had originally solicited me for.  Like any corporation,  One customer loss, no big deal but if millions walk away, the little guy can regain some power over these jerks!!

Countertop Horror, part II, so last night the countertop company calls about my countertop being ready to install.  Seems that the douche bags at Home Depot, Queen Creek, dont care about their vendors, either.  After I cancelled, the order after being treated like crap, they further bungled the job not letting them know about the cancellation and manufactured my countertop anyway.  The company told me Home Depot was going to "eat. it"  It would have been so much easier if they had made things right, smiled, been polite and just helped me, but all management are as stupid and degrading as their spawn employees! And their lies caught up with them!

I always liked Ruby Tuesday, in Gilbert, AZ because you can always get in , when every other restaurant around them is busy.  I like the salad bar.  But RT is not good at a signature  dish or meal and seem to change their menu, waaay too much!  RT needs to decide what their food identity is and make that food extra good and reasonable.  FILTH ALERT!!!!  The other night we were seated by the wood blinds that surround the outer tables by the windows, they were covered with DIRT as far as the eye could see!!!  I used my napkin to wipe the dirt and show tbe manager....HE SAID, "THEY HAVE NO ONE TO CLEAN THE RESTAURANT, EXCEPT THE EMPLOYEES AND THEY  WON'T CLEAN THE BLINDS ."   Are you kidding me????   No janitor, no cleaning crew, no budget to clean, only employees????  Well, "ha ha" Mr. Manager, (who was laughing at me , while he shares, " it won't be happening")...DIRT AND GRIME ARE not funny and that is nauseating, DISGUSTING and disturbing!!!! ( especially, your nonchalant attitude!!!!)  A chain restaurant that does not have a cleaning crew in place, could put the public health at risk!  Are the employees cleaning the toilet and then serving the customers????  I  don't eat with dirty ANYTHING in my own house, let alone PAY BIG BUCKS to SIT IN YOUR FILTHY RESTAURANT, surrounded by grime!!!!  Appalling!!!  CLOSE THE DAMN RESTAURANT AND CLEAN THE RUGS, BLINDS, KITCHEN AND BATHROOMS FROM TOP TO BOTTOM...budget the cleaning and make your menu smaller...  Otherwise in the words of Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones:   "GOODBYE, RUBY TUESDAY, WHO COULD HANG A NAME ON YOU?  WHEN YOU CHANGE WITH EVERY NEW DAY, STILL I'M GONNA MISS YOU!"  Let me know when that dump is cleaned!!! Otherwise, goodbye!

Queen Creek has very few restaurants and people are desperate , and probably eat "whatever" and say it's good!  I wanted to like this place but it is inconsistent in quality and service. I detest their sweet pork, and would enjoy a carnita pork, with spice, instead of sauce, My friend had a chile verde and did not like everything in a tinfoil container, running into a green mucous mess. Who wants to eat predigested food???  I stood in line while my chicken mango salad sat there through the 4 people paying ahead of me   By the time I sat down my tortilla was cold and lettuce wilted under the heat of the chicken.  As a former Calif.  who has eaten exceptional Mexican food this place is just ok!

I am negatively reviewing this gym due to their affiliation to T Fitness and other concerns.  I was never taken aside and offered any sessions on how to use the equipment....ever!  I had never been in a gym up until I signed up with a friend, December, 2011, when I joined.  Lauren was pleasant but that was it!  No help what so ever from then to now.  there is no newsletter, tips or free classes offered for this membership only APPS on my phone that I have found.  The Anytime Fitness App does not work right on my smartphone.  There are flat screen TVs everywhere.  why can't routines be accessed on those to help the workout?  Like running routines on the treadmill, elliptical and stair climber, instead of silent TV that I can watch at home!  there should be a way to put AF Apps on TV and maximize gym time   I also signed up with my friend thinking I was getting UBF Training, 45 min per session 3 days a month.  I got T Fitness, horrible training,terrible management (I am being generous) the gym is so small, with no extra rooms... When im training on my dime some dude muscles in, drinks water and drips it on me while I do a floor exercise.  The trainers suck, already asked to be refunded my money!  Lawrence Thomas has never talked to me or addressed my concerns, and the environment there is aggravating!  The gym is too small to train, unless on a machine.  They also push Avocare, $1000 later... Do a Paleo diet instead!  Also I got screwed on training time, I got less than 30 min, not knowing that TFitness took over and Indidnt get 45 min.  Also, no suggestions what to work on the other 6 days!I I am paying $105 a month for less than 90 min a month....I wish I had a job that paid me that much an hour for nothing!  I want my money back!  I heard that The trainer I had got fired and I have not been called regarding a replacement!  I am currently out $3000 and the results are underwhelming!  It is because of my Workout Trainer Free Phone App and my Paleo Diet thatnI am seeing any change.  TFitness needs to refund my money!B I am very unhappy with your underwhelming help!  Anytime Fitness needs to provide space for training and be more helpful to their members.  And stop pushing Advocare!  Instead of spending an hour explaining the program to some customer on company time, help the members!  Stay Away from here!

Used this cleaning service for years in AZ and CA, the good thing was consistent days; but didnot listen to me, was not listening to the time we wanted or cleaning properly...  the cleaning was not up to my standards, and I had to complain often!   Items were broken, one in particular, which was a special antique I had for decades.  How do you replace the irreplaceable?? It got worse when they changed owners, and became patronizing boobs!  We would leave a tip and get a half assed, crappy, cleaning...gave them a ton of chances...use another company, plenty of others who want to please the customer.

A local place, that used to be reasonable, I was swatting a fly last visit....the food is blah, a flour tortilla with egg and meat , absolutely no taste, garnish or imagination went into the presentation.  Cut and dry.  Nothing outstanding...you feel ripped off.  When I go out, I want the food to be better than I cook...very disappointing...

I enjoyed the choices on the menu, pickled veggies and got the large brat for $12, my date had the pork schnitzel with fingerling potatoes for $14. His was generous and filling but here's the deal...a little imagination goes a long way and garnish, veggies or side salad included along with the one side would be more appealing.  My brat in a bun with chutney as a side and the plate showed a lot of porcelain, and I dont eat bread...

A $12 Brat with chutney should have a salad and fries included ...for that price. I even ordered without the bun.  We spent a $40 spot and that didnot include beer, I was hungry when I left.   We were under the impression it was a German restaurant...NOT!   Does urban mean vibe mean: " little portions for big bucks" ?   I can BUY a package of brats at the store for a couple bucks, and lettuce and potatoes cost pennies...  Unless restaurants give me my $ worth, I will never return.

Warning, Do Not Buy Groupon...Spent $25.00 for six "elite" car washes at Full Circle Car Wash.  The first one,  the car was cleaned inside and out.  But wash 2-6, was exterior water only,  no wiping.  I can go down the street and run my car through a wash and get wet and wiped down for less...A giant rip off!!!  I have gone "full circle", alright!!!  Never again will I go to that misleading, ELITE car wash or use Groupon...(Hey Groupon check the quality of what you sell...)

I am a tutor to a student, who attends this so-called , high school, for autistic students. Since I am an elementary teacher, tutor and advocate for this individual, I was appalled at their treatment of parents/students last year, at the Back To School Night!  We had to stand in 100 degree heat, no a/c, chairs, no microphone,  no water or refreshments ,no accommodations whatsoever....   We struggled to follow an hour long presentation, of which we heard nothing!! Autistic kids were bored out of their skulls...wandering around.  They opened a "storefront" on Warner/ 87 and called it an autism school.  Tuition is in the $25k range.  In addition, it was furnished with leftover, thrift store, furniture and was not state of the art by any means...We were shocked!!!You had to pay extra for transportation and food...When I emailed them, with concerns, the husband, of the owner ,who not only is not educated to answer questions, he gave a nasty, snippy response, ANYWAY, with NO solution to the family concerns.  This year, 2014-15,they relocated the high school campus to Higley and Ray, which is located in Gilbert.  The pick up is awkward,my client's mother has had little to no communication,  the teen seems to have regressed and all he says is, " I'm autistic !"  Originally, in 9th grade, he had tried online HS, algebra and geometry,  he has been reduced to fractions...again.  He never gets homework, his mother has had no communication or explanation as to what is going on, an inappropriate,  inadequate, IEP, no lifeplan , no mention of job training and all he mutters when he doesn't want to try is using his condition as a crutch...this is hardly empowering a high functioning, autistic student.  He is more than capable and able to work toward a future, why aren't there strategies, accountability,  partnership with EVIT for life/job training??? Not okay, stay away.

Went later on Sunday and waited for 45 min for two people, very irritating...when we eventually were served the food was just..OK. I've eaten at many similar type restaurants in So. Cal, like Good Stuff, Scottys, Joe's etc. and Matts food doesn't even come close to quantity, quality or imagination to qualify the more pricey menu for such food...I saw burned hashbrowns and bacon pass me by on its way to being served...Was extremely disappointed and drove 50 miles to try....however, people are lined out the door...just not that imaginative! Come on Arizona!

Trendy can always cloud our senses.  A cute place, WAY too loud music!! I want to eat NOT dance!!! (At the moment). We were celebrating a birthday and we were seated by the front door so the ambiance was looking at Gilbert Rd.  The menu was simple and the food overpriced and underwhelming for tacos...I had a burrito which came out burned....it was extremely tiny for $8.  It was black, plunked on a plate, with no other friends, embellishments or garnish,  except an itty-bitty cup for a tablespoon of sauce.  Honestly how much does a thimble of beans, rice or salad cost!???   I sent it back and they graciously and profusely apoligized,the manager even came by and apoligized and brought me an unburned version of the same, tiny, burrito.   My friends had three tacos that looked ok.  Since I'm from California,  the Mexican, or trendy Mexican food in Arizona , is substandard to say the least and not even close to what I'm used to.  Mexican food is not expensive...  The manager took the burrito off the bill but with tacos, burrito and non-alcoholic drinks $48 with tip.  Plus, no  treat for the birthday girl and the desserts did not sound appetizing..  I will never return,  It didn't WOW me...there are bigger and better out there , without the hype, the trend, the crowded location and full parking lots on a Wednedsay night !  It's no big deal!  I realize this is a bar atmosphere but I'm beginning to be extra picky about a little bit food for high prices....and the quality better rock, to justify those prices...

This area has limited options...you can't depend on something being good twice.   A salad, tiny soup, piece of bread and drink over $12.  A Citrus Salad with two tiny pieces of orange on it????  Oranges are currently $1.99 for a BAG of them in a supermarket!    Desserts are ok but I don't want to eat desserts for dinner...  Went with a group of friends and we collectively spent $80 and the "collection" of food was pitiful...better off buying something at the grocrery store.  I never thought I would see a fast food place charge so much for a salad meal.    Unimpressed, sad and bummed that another dud of a restaurant has arrived in QC.  Remember, this is Arizona and not even close to being Beverly Hills...

Queen Creek is in dire need of good restaurants and I was so excited to visit the former site of Barro's in Queen Creek...magically transformed...to Babbo...  Upon entering the premises it had indoor/ outdoor dining, stylishly decorated, crystal chandeliers,  urban chic, very lovely decor.  The menu seemed eclectic with Italian pasta dishes and a Chalkboard Menu which was an alternative to pasta...  $13 later, 4oz of chicken, a pile of carrots, burned broccolli, undercooked asparagus, and a salad with 4 oz of the kitchen sink...I was extremely disappointed.  The rest of my party also ordered similar and the pile of carrots in the middle of the table looked like a rabbit trap.  The overly cheerful waiter asked if we wanted more broccolli, (sure if it has tiramisu on it).  The bread was the best part...with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. ..  The pasta dish was pasta martini and it was an underwhelming mix of mush....we wanted to love it but will based on that performance, we will never return.  Hey Babbo, 3 people returned their vegetables and piled them in the center of the table, how about a complimentary dessert because the food sucked...  More broccoli,  I can't stop laughing....($65 for that slop):the jokes on me.

I am going to upgrade my rating because Babbo had the balls (meatballs) to step up to the plate, (sorry)! And comp me for my disaster of a meal.  They were apologetic, humble and genuinely cared about my experience being positive and delicious!  Well, I now love their salads, delicious bread , served with balsamic and olive oil.  Their pizza is cheesy, with generous meatballs and basil garnish, couldn't eat it all!  I have gone back 10 more times and will absolutely recommend it because of the friendly, caring, staff, great drinks and good service!!! This restaurant has character, owned their mistakes and didn't shirk from making it right!!!!  Thank you and I appreciate that!

A little history....this location, which is an old house, is below street level and in the backyard of many new housing communities located on the corner of Sossman and Queen Creek Rds.  PRIOR renters, and there have be at least 6 other businesses, have come and gone in 5 years... For some reason, this business owner, overhauled the property....lit it up more., added a volleyball court and lots of outdoor space...which is larger than the indoor space....when 117 degree weather hits that might be a terrible decision.  The menu is limited, tacos, with store bought tortillas.  I HAD the steak bowl which was so tough, I could hardly chew it....my friend could not chew his tacos at all.  They comped his meal.  The waitress was very nice, the manager, a sweetheart and he wanted to make it right...but based on our food I would never come back. (you earned 2 stars because of nice attitudes).  Costa Vida, Chipolte , Cafe Rio, charge 6.00-8.50 for a superior product....  Then menu is very limited and you better like tacos.  Our complementary, spiced, chips, were tiny and broken.    My advice, expand your menu and look and see what others are doing at their Mexican restaurants and make it better to justify 10.99, for a bowl of slop.
