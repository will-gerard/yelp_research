First off, love Wild Thaiger, food is excellent, service is by in large prompt, courteous, and a relaxed atmosphere.   However, I had a bad experience, where I witnessed a cockroach walking across the bar in front of me. I voiced my concern to Ola, she couldn't find it. But apologized. I was dissatisfied with this response and wrote her an email expressing my concerns. This is her appropriate, professional abbreviated response.  "As a regular you know we have an "A" rating because we don't have a pest problem.  I will be glad to share the pest inspection reports and monthly service schedule for the last eight years which we have been in business.  It would be a perfect world if I could afford to have enough staff to open all of our boxes in the parking lot and stock all of our products individually to ensure that unwanted pests do not enter our doors. Of course we have discontinued purchasing product from the supplier and they are aware of the problem."  She refunded my money, and we're satisfied, moved on.   I show up today with my party---and she pulls me out of the restaurant, tells me that "i'm not supporting her business" and that a few days after my email she gets an inspection from the Maricopa County Health Department, and they gave her a "B" rating. She proceeds to accuse me of calling them, and blaming me for her low grade. I inform her that I dealt with her straight, communicated directly with her, and I considered it resolved. At this point she tells me she won't serve me anymore after being a customer for about seven years.  Having never dealt with the Maricopa Environmental Services, I'm not really aware with how they schedule their inspections but clearly it was a coincidence that it occurred 6 days later. I guess Ola never thought perhaps it was a different customer, or in fact that maybe it was scheduled every 3 months?  At any rate her reaction to customer feedback is not only unprofessional but just makes bad business sense.   Poor decision Ola, I'm really surprised your sanitation problem, and failing an inspection is blamed on your customers.

I've been using Simon and Sons for years, have had excellent results and always feel like i'm treated fairly and honestly. When the owner is the one who greets you and works on your car, you get a better feeling than someone who's paid on commission and has a quota to fill.

The Good--Dr Day is well educated, very capable, and instills confidence that in his patients that your procedure will be completed successfully.  Also they can get you in quickly for your initial visit and follow-up visits.   The Bad--he took out all four of my wisdom teeth, and I had to make two more visits for him to finish the job and get the remaining shards out.  The Ugly-- He's very arrogant, his professionalism is subpar, and he's insulting to his patients at time.   When I came in the last time for him to remove the last part of the tooth he missed the previous two visits, he rubbed some ointment on the area to numb it. So as he comes towards my mouth with what looked like pliers to "snip" the tooth off, I asked if there was going to be any local anesthesia, his reply was the ointment was good enough and to "stop being a wimp". I was kind of shocked but knowing he's got these pliers in my mouth, I figured I'd laugh it off. Well then when he poked the side of my cheek with the pliers trying to get to the tooth, I kind of flinched. Woops, my mistake! He slings the pliers and mirror onto the tray, tells the assistant to get a local, and storms off.   I had read reviews on another website of Dr. Day and they pretty much said the same thing. But I figured, i'd give him a shot anyway as my situation is a little more complicated that impacted, adult wisdom teeth. I don't regret going to him, but I can't recommend him.

Food was good,  service decent. Nice patio. Just drove by now looks awfully dark. Number is disconnected. Looks like the end. Sorry to see them close.

Thai Lahna, some of the best flavors around. From the Tom Kai Gai, to their Prad Prik Khing rice, its just a food orgasm in your mouth.   Like many, i'm always dissapointed in the service. They're shorthanded and they have their wait staff help with kitchen duties like cutting vegetables, etc   I recommend either A. ordering take out or B. Order your food when you get there, to minimize the wait.

Very blah. No flavors stood out at all. Actually if you ask me the biggest flavor was salt. I kept asking for more refills of water to wash my salt down. They would fill the water up with 90 percent ice, refill again please. The kid serving me, I doubt he could even spell Chinese or for that matter find China on a map.   Poor food, poor service. Its almost like they copied Pei Wei and did an extremely poor job of copying a mediocre restaurant.  Look for this one to close down in 12 months.

Wow. I'm still stunned at my experience from this hotel. Normally I stay at the TI, or Venetian, Mirage, but since I waited until the last second, and it was four days before New Years, I went against my better judgement and booked at the Las Vegas Hilton (aka Las Vegas Hotel). Well the room was more of a 2 star room, adequate, functional, with a bathroom that resembled a motel 6 bathroom. They basically added a 400 dollar flat screen which qualifies as a remodel nowadays at these hotels. But why do I give it  a one star rating? Well we wake up New Years morning and my fiance tells me she has a bug bite on her hand. Which I  kind of assumed maybe it was from a mosquito, except there was two bites right in a row?? Well at that point guessed who came crawling up the comforter? I was the actual resident of the room! Yes, you guessed it. We were not alone in that bed, it was indeed a disgusting BED BUG  in search of dessert. When the Las Vegas Hilton says free meals, they should qualify that! I had never seen a bed bug to that point so I trapped the little guy in a glass and googled him. It was a bed bug for sure, flat, looks like a tick, a little bigger than I imagined. So I took him down to the front desk and asked the manager (Melissa) what she thought it was. Surprisingly enough she had a look of  bewilderment. "I don't know...." was her response. I educated her and told her its a bed bug, apparently she's never seen a bed bug before???? So then the hotel went into response mode, and told me security would meet me in the room. I went up to the room to meet security. 30 minutes later no security. I called back down the front desk, and RC  told me security had some emergencies to deal with and to call back in an hour. He graciously offered me a free buffet while we waited. So, not being one to give up a free meal--I took him up on his offer. It was interesting that on the reason slip for the buffet, he didn't note "bed bug infestation" it was noted "leaky tub"--Denial?  Well, buffet---below average--sounds good in theory---but it reminded me of airline food back when they served it "free". So I returned to the room, and waited for security. As we waited for security two more bed bugs beat them to the room. (Apparently the good word is out about the complimentary blood buffet in room 457). I called again downstairs to RC and he says Lee from security on the way to investigate. Lee shows up shortly there after looks at the one we captured and the other ones crawling around (who knows how more there are that we can't see, as they blend in well on the brown floor and furniture) and calls down to presumably RC to tell him yes, there's a bed bug problem.  So let me cut to the chase, here's their solution. Since I'm leaving the next day is to move me to an "upgraded" room, which is basically the  same room, plus a sofa and a bathroom that looks more in like it had been remolded in the past ten years. Noticing that it seemed that this remedy was all that would  be offered, I went to the front desk to request a refund. I believed this to be a simple and easy request. Alas they did not agree. I was told to take it up with "risk management". Who is risk management? Dissatisfied I then left a message for the hotel general manager Joanne Murphy to call me. Two days later, no call, apparently this is how they take care of their guests.     In speaking with RC, and JR, of their management (yes apparently the ones that talk to you only give their initials??) They stated that bed bugs are in all hotels, the Wynn, Venetian, etc). My response, was--maybe. But what's different about those hotels is that they seek remedies to satisfy their guests, not try to sweep it under the rug or believe a fair remedy is to feed their guests disgusting buffet food.  I have to go now, I have to dry clean these clothes to make sure there's no eggs in them or otherwise I'd have my own infestation!,   Thanks Las Vegas Hilton, and Joanne Murphy!

I have been a patient of Dr Steen and his staff for going on 4 years. Dr Steen's expertise, and care is unsurpassed. His staff is cheerful, professional and accommodating. i'd drive 30 miles to get this type of service any day.

Disappointing. I picked Tom after glowing reviews in Facebook. We mutually agreed on a time, and of course he cancelled at the last second. No big deal, he came out another day, gave me a good quote and what I needed to provide. It took a couple of months for me to get the sink, as its an unusual set up I guess. When I called him out the second time, he didn't remember me for whatever reason. I called him on Tuesday, he said he couldn't be there until Friday. No big deal, took the afternoon off work on Friday to be there. He calls 15 minutes before the appointment, can't make it. His last job has taken more time than he expected. Ok, i said how about tomorrow. He said call me at 9am. If I don't have to work this job I'll work yours. I found it odd how I was going out of my way, but tried to be understanding. Called him at 9. Couldn't do it.  When I asked him when he could he said Wednesday, which I wouldn't be available for. So I called him out, asking him why it seemed he had no sense of urgency after causing the original inconvenience, to which his response is, "I think you should find another plumber" Which lead me to reaching out to Freddy Rooter (see review) dude came out same day, got it done. Thanks Freddy!  Sounds like others have had the same problem with Tom??? Not sure.

Being so close to Rosati's I've always wanted to try their food. The reviews have kept me away, but when GroupOn offered a deal, I figured this would reduce my risk.   As a fan of thick crust, I ordered the "Double Crust" Deluxe Pizza and a Meatball Sandwich. I will say the pizza toppings were quality, the amount of cheese and flavor respectable. However, what makes a pizza is the crust, and I'll say I've had better crust on frozen pizza. The actual crust was more of a cracker like consistency, and was barely higher than the toppings. And the clincher was, I couldn't even pick up the pizza without the toppings and cheese falling off. Pizza isn't hard to make and they failed.  The Meatball Sub was a little better, again the ingredients were tasty, but the bread--soggy, wouldn't stay together. Eat it with a fork. Oregano's Meatball sub is far far better for the same price.   Sorry Rosati's I wanted to like you, but there's too many better choices--even if I have to drive further.

Service : Mozell's been cutting my mop for years and putting up with my bad jokes for aslong. She gets 5 stars just for that alone. But seriously, I can't be happier with the professional service she delivers every time. As a guy, most stylists see me as an opportunity to catch up on their schedule, or more bluntly give me a 10-15 minute haircut, make it look pretty to my lyin' eyes and send me on my way. Its usually the next day when people start confusing me with Lloyd Christmas from Dumb and Dumber that I realize I've been had. Mozell's different, she takes her time, has style, and makes me look good. People notice when I get my haircut, and actually compliment me.  Location: Usually when I go to Old Town Scottsdale, I expect to pay a premium for any service I receive.  However with Mozell, the prices is very reasonable. Even for  the prices for hair products are competitive. Parking is easy as on one side you've got the Arizona School of Real Estate, and the other Buca Di Beppo.    Scheduling:  I usually make appointments, but she has squeezed me in in a pinch in short notice--thanks Mozell.  Bottom Line; If you have easy hair (like mine) or difficult hair (as it seems most of her clients I see her working with have), give her a call. Your hair will thank you, and your friends will compliment you.  One recommendation to Mozell:  Add a Flat Screen above work station so I can watch the Sun Devils!

The good: hysterical comedians, including Howard. There was only one of the four that I wouldn't pay to hear again--or wish to hear at all. The headliner Lachlan was hilarious, he sure knows how to "party". It was a  fair price, I didn't use the Yelp discount but it was worth the 15 dollars, plus the two drink minimum.   Room for improvement? Well I asked for a glass of water in the bar, and also in the club to compliment the alcohol. I was told twice they don't serve free water. First time in 15 years in AZ i was told that. that's unfortunate as its a reasonable request that's never been refused anywhere.

I'll admit--I tried this place solely because the reviews were overall very good, and the fact they were closing added a sense of urgency.   Its a quaint little place, has a style of its own, and it certainly original if anything. But that's where the good pretty much comes and goes. First, price for a hot dog, tater tots and shaved ice is like 11 dollars. Seemed a bit steep but I don't mind paying for good food.  The person working the front counter was 40ish, with blonde hair, and well lets just say she's been under the knife, a good many times.  And well you guessed it, didn't seem to have a clue what was going on, so it was chaos.   So I ordered a Shaggy Dog which includes chili, slaw and onions. I ordered is sans the slaw. What I got was a blackened beef hot dog, a tasty bun, and something akin to hormel chili. The tots were good if not small a small serving, and the shaved ice was, well shaved ice. I think the problem is their cook was not working that day, so the owner John had to cook instead of work the customers which  led to the problems. My friend ordered a turkey burger it arrived with crumbled all over, (menu didn't indicate it had bacon) so I politely just asked them to take it off. he took about half of it off.  At that point we asked just for a refund on the burger (uneaten), so  he slams the plate and burger in the trash can and mumbles 6.65 to the cashier?? She didn't hear him so she asked him what he said, and he yelled give them 6.65!!  From the back kitchen. It was uncomfortable to say the least.

I had a bad experience with a different plumber so I reached out to Freddy. Not only did he come out the same day to bid on the job, he was on time, communicated well and did solid work for a fair price. I would recommend Freddy for any plumbing work! He made what I struggled with for days look easy. Clearly, i'm not professional plumber material but Freddy is!

Pleasantly surprised. Delicious food, excellent service. Dug the free ice cream and pickles.  The employees seemed to care, be excited to be there, and want you to enjoy the experience. Funny thing, they didn't work on tips--and i'm not even sure I saw the pre-requiste tip jar either.   We'll be back for the fall off the bone pork ribs, and spicy bbq sauce!

Groupon trap---Saw the groupon, saw the glowing reviews, didn't read there was only 4 at the time. Showed up on slow night, 7pm with 4 tables. Not usually a good sign, but gave it a go. The quality of food was average, the sushi was fresh, teppanyaki was average. However, the server had no business working there. She didn't know the menu very well, an misquoted what came with what, and never told you what you were getting. I asked what fish came with the Shashimi platter, she said "chef's choice" ok. I figured when she brought it out, she'd tell me what the choice today was, but no. There's no presentation, no professionalism. The glowing, scrolling, LED name tags reminded me of a cocktail waitress from The Highlighter (not that I've been, but a friend told me!) Had to ask for refills over and over, just really poor experience. When I told the manager??? on the way out, I don't think he understood. Expensive lesson for me.

First we're Persian food fans, with a couple of people in my party being native Persians, so tough crowd to please. I, like many, bought the Groupon which I'll admit sometimes leads to lower expectations. We were pleasantly surprised. The service was good, they're a little young and green so be prepared but they do have the desire to please which is refreshing. We ordered the three beef and three chicken dishes. Overall the chicken dish which came with three different chicken selections, two huge plates of rice and roasted veggies was our favorite. The beef was average but well portioned. We were also delighted with the "cute" belly dancer. She had energy, got our daughters into the mix and made it more than a dinner but an experience. We'll be back!
