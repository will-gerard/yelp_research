Stopped in on a whim.  Looks can be deceiving as this place was great.   Service was excellent.  Ordered the orange chicken and hot tea.  Meal came with a fried spring roll and a couple other fried app and soup.  Everything was hot, and delicious.  Chicken wasn't the usual weird ball shape meat but actual cuts off a breast.   I would t drive all the way out to Peoria to eat here but if I was in the area and hungry I'd stop.

What a great surprise.  Ordered the carne asada quesadilla and a taco.   Both were perfect. No cilantro at all (cilantro is the devil).  Both came dressed with cabbage and some onion.    Normally I'm not sure about a places salsa.  I tried both and both were fantastic with a perfect spice.

Very slow, yet over staffed.  No defined manager keeping the place in order.  Has that club vibe with the house/bass pumping music playing.   Is it breakfast or a night club?  Tried the Korean chicken & (bacon) waffle.  (They sprinkle cilantro on the chicken for any haters).  Wasn't bad but at $16 a plate no thanks. I'll go to Lolo's.  Might stop back for a drink but I'll skip breakfast in the future.
