This is a great place to grab some food before a ball game. Just minutes from the stadiums in downtown. The old purple artistic wall that could be seen from the freeway as you passed by is gone now but he great food is still inside.   Unlike many of the horrible Mexican places in south Phoenix this one is by far one of the best. There is a reason why they have a huge parking lot, great food brings a lot of people. For all of you who are afraid to venture into this part of town, have no fear there is security in the parking lot.   Check this places out! The horchata is made fresh and is delish!

I found this place back when I was working in the downtown area. Always in a rush for lunch and the traffic from everyone getting lunch in the area this place was perfect.   I always love Japanese comfort food. Katsu chicken is always a favorite especially with a little miso soup. I love the great staff there, always friendly and helpful. The older staff is always up beat and friendly and give me a sense of security as it reminds me of my grandma.   I definitely recommend this place to everyone, way better than any of those "blah blah bowl" chains.

For what the valley has to offer and for the little community the Japanese has this is by far a hidden gem. The cravings for Japanese comfort food is often hard to satisfy here in the desert. Often trips to LA will have to be the one to kill such cravings.   This place is mom and pop and very comforting to me. Many with closed minds will not give this place a shot after walking in but with one taste of the food they will know that the appearances of the surroundings is nothing compared to the food they serve.   For what you pay the portions are generous and the dinner is very complete with the miso soup, salad, yakitori skewer and gyoza that you also get.   I love to support the local businesses and especially family run establishments where the owner is the one you talk to.

When comparing this place to the previous Hodori of days past it has gone down hill considerably. I have seen it's ups and downs but with changing of hands as if it were currency this place has been through a lot. The current owner who ever it maybe is doing it a little better than the others but that's not a far reach from them.   This like a few other Korean places in town specializes in Tofu stew. The stew here when it first opened many many years ago was very good. This restaurant if you think about it changed the way many Korean restaurants are done here now. The way the food is, the look and I have to say the onset of the tofu epidemic to AZ.   The stews are good right now with lots of flavor and and great portions of meat in them if you get the pork or beef. The stir fry pork bellys with spicy kimchee is my favorite and the spicy octopus stir fry is good as well.  There aren't a lot of Korean restaurants here in the valley but I have to say when Hodori is on point they are good. As far as service goes, it is a hit or miss. But what place isn't like that. I have had days where at Denny's I have spectacular service but poor service here. I just don't expect anything more from Arizona Korean restaurants since it's not like LA.

Being a huge fan of Vietnamese food and how healthy it is I tried this place with a friends recommendation. He had pointed this place out since it had the very same menu as my favorite place Da Vang. Knowing this I thought this place was maybe a family relative or something and might have a very similar food, which should be very good.   Boy was I wrong! So wrong that I would almost have thought that my friend was playing a horrible joke on me. Had he not been sitting next to me I would have thought that he was not serious about this place. Almost so bad to the point that I had to question our friendship for a brief short period we were sitting there.   To start, the spring roll. One of the most popular Vietnamese creations that everyone knows. When done right it can cause overloading emotions of happiness and satisfaction. We all know that a good spring roll is a sign of a good beginning to a meal, almost like that first real good kiss you get.  Well this one is not it, small, skinny and filled with nothing but lost hope and broken dream. Small portions of shrimp and meat, if there was any meat in it at all. Most of all the they even cheaped out on the vermicelli noodles, lettuce and mint. More like the worst kiss you ever got , bad enough to break up over.   Then the pho, the staple of Vietnamese cuisine, the first thing that anyone thinks about when they hear Vietnamese food. Well upon ordering the food I expected a delicious and heart warming soup. Well the broth was flavorless, I could have made a better one with water and  a bouillon cube. The dish was beautiful though. So simple, and the onions and jalapeno cut thin as they can get it and the cilantro chopped roughly. The taste was just not there.   The service like any Vietnamese place was lacking. This place was the worst of them all. The server, a kid who spoke no English paying no attention to anyone and not caring at all.  He must have gotten suckered into free labor by his father or someone who equally didn't care about their patrons.  All in all the visual appeal of the pho was amazing in that the small details of the ingredients were executed nicely. The  spring roll was done poorly and you can get a better one from Trader Joe's. The flavors of the food lacking in all aspects, please someone give them some salt and pepper to cook with. Pho in it's greatness can be enjoyed with out all the sriracha or hoison we all love to ruin the natural flavor of the broth with, but this place it is needed to bring the brown water of a broth to life.

The younger Hispanic cashier who also works mens department was the most courteous and helpful out of all the off 5th stores. He was more than willing to help me and answer all my questions with out having to go ask anyone. This location lacks a lot of the selection compared to the new store in chandler but makes up for it inservice.

I love this place. This was the first place I ever had Pho, back in 1998. This place is always busy now. The prices are so cheap that It always keeps me coming back. The food is great and I always get their spring rolls.   I eat here about 2 times a week. The service here is not that great but the food makes up for it. I do have to say that since I come here so much the staff that is always there seems to know me and our order now. Service gets better when your a regular I guess.  Voted best spring rolls in Phoenix Magazine.

I been to this place a few times over the past couple years. As a chef I go through cravings for some traditional Korean comfort food especially since I get sick of eating at my work and I cook all day for others I want someone to do the cooking for me. This place is usually open late so when i'm off work later it seems to be the only option. I always liked some of their dishes here before it changed.  When they changed owners the food was good for a little bit then as expected changed and was horrible now. Some of the dishes were over powered in onions or some other ingredient. The cook in the back should taste the sauce before sending it out.   I would go here again but i'm not in rush out the door for this place.

After hearing that Sea Saw was closing I was in a panic. Although I have never eaten here and I always was planing on it, I was devastated. So the first thing I had to do was call my buddy Clifford who I know enjoys good food as much as I do to pay our respects.   We arrived thinking that it was going to be a mad house of people. Especially with the special price of 35 per person and a banquet style feast. I have to say it was as good and anyone would say it is. Some of the dishes were not as great as I would have assumed but that could just be from my sushi experiences.   The dishes made by Nobu were above and beyond expectations. The steamed pork bun is that of something to be found in a upscale place in New York, or the roasted peppers amazing.   The flavors are wonderful and the signature dishes like the crab sandwich are unforgettable. I do have to agree that this place is not for everyone. A experience that one has to take in with an open mind and willingness to eat with thier taste buds first and not their opinions or mind.   Hopefully Nobu's next restaurant opens very soon as I am already craving the pork buns.

I always heard of the great food here and I had a chance finally to try it out. I'm a huge fan of large portions and my dish was gigantic. I ordered a braised pork with a creamy sauce and fingerling potatoes. It was just as I would have expected from a place like this.   They are very busy and I can see why. The decor, and ambiance is very inviting for a couple to larger groups. I love the drinks and the wine list is a bit over whelming for a amateur wine drinker like me.   I saw so many things on the menu I wanted to try but I did not want to look like a fatty in front of my date. I might have to sneak back over there on my next day off.   I recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good food and doesn't have any hang ups of trying new things. Next is FnB!!

I have been here a couple times. The first time I went it was still under the Shanghai Palace name. I heard that Shanghai Palace was the only place in town that had soup dumplings. When I went I turned out the place changed hands to Tottie. Well I had already made my trip there from the air port. My friend who was with me who is also a chef decided to try out some of their dim sum and some apps. The dim sum items were over steamed and were dried out on top. Even the eggrolls were horrible. We noticed the sushi bar and the millions of items on the menu. I would never order something that not the specialty for the restaurant. I mean yeah asian fusion is good when done right but this place is far from that. It is just a bunch of different types of Asian food and non of it is fusion just traditional done wrong!  The second time I went I decided to give them a shot. I heard their Pho was good. Although I think Tottie is a Thai specialty. Well I have to say that not only was the service mediocre and we had to keep asking for water, I found a long, I mean real long, knotted hair in my pho. Of course I find it at the end of my meal and I nearly threw up on the table when I pulled out the hair from my mouth.   Not only is the food horrible, it's dirty and service sucks. I can handle bad food if the place was clean and they had good service. I don't think I ever saw any of the staff wash their hands after touching their hair, face or what not before serving food. Gross. You will never see me back here again. This might be a harsh review but I gave them 2 chances.

Every time I come here I always expect the best. Just as the previous times I have been here. I always am surprised by this place every time. The food is great and always consistent.  The service is great and consistent as well, something that is a hard find these days. The food is served in generous portions that makes the price seem too good to be true. When you get your bill and see the total for the amount of food you received you feel as if your waitress forgot to ring in your whole order or gave you someone else bill. You just say nothing pay the bill and leave so you don't get caught, but wait, it's true it was yours so no sneaking out.

With the little amounts of Japanese people in Arizona I am surprised there is a bakery. I am glad there is. I have seen this bakery for year as I frequent the neighboring businesses. On one such occasion I decided to give them a shot and ordered a sandwich and some pastries.   I have to say, as good as it gets here in Arizona. From what I can tell they are very consistent and the staff have been here for a very long time so you know they know what they are doing.   A hidden gem in the valley!

For being a smaller store they have real good prices. Unlike some of the smaller asian stores here in town where they charge a lot. Fujiya is always stocked up with great items and is always clean and doesn't smell like some other stores. The staff is friendly and always helpful. The cashier girl is cute too!  They have the cheapest price for my favorite Japanese candy, only 0.69 for hi-chews!!!

By far one of the best places for breakfast in Vegas. If the locas love it it has to be good. Not crowded with tourists, so crazy kids or weird people here. The food is served it very generous portions and I love the olmelt skillets with gravy. The last time I was there they started doing fresh corned beef hash, wow!  By far the best hidden gem close to the strip.

The first time I went to Coppers was for a 50cent beer night. It was mayhem! So crowded that It was impossible to get a drink. I never gave a thought to this place.   Then again I tried this place to get wings. I was told by someone who came into my work that Coppers has the best wings. Being a wing freak I had to go. My boss who is also a wing guy went with me. We are very critical with out food, being chef's and all we are super picky I guess.   The wings were crispy, tangy and delicious! If I were to picture perfect wings this would be it! As we tried other items nothing come out as good as the wings.   I can truly say this place lives up to the Best Wings in the North Valley!!!!  Everytime we went we never had any problems finding a seat or a crazy crowd, seems as if things died down a bit but the Karaoke nights gets annoying so watch out.

When I was a drinker I would have given this place 5 stars but now that i'm not all I can give for now is 4. Which is still good, especially for a corporate chain restaurant.  I have to say on every occasion I have been here I have always had a good experience. The food was always good and service consistent. When I accompany my beer drinking friends to the bar the bartender is always helpful and friendly.   My favorite items are the turkey pot pie and chop salad. I wish I could order both in one sitting but the gigantic portions keep me from over indulging in the goodness.

This place is my all time favorite for Gelato and Coffee. When I used work in old town I would make my trek down Scottsdale road on foot even on those hot summer days when cars pass you by just to bring excruciating gusts of hot desert air upon your back it was well worth it for their  iced lattes.   Now I have discovered Affagoto, a large scoop of your choice gelato and fresh brewed espresso poured on top to create a delicious heart pounding  rush of caffeine and sugar. It feels like how one would feel when they fall in love for the first time, but this comes at only a $5 price and you can feel it all over again.   The staff is great, courteous and very informative in making suggestions.   Gelato Spot Thank you!

Being that there are a limited amount of Korean restaurants in the valley it's hard to try to compare them. It's either good or bad. Although some of these places go through many changes in owners and the quality and service fluctuates.  Nothing can compare to Southern Cali Korean food but this place has been a favorite for the family. There are other places but this is the closest and never had anything bad. I love the table top grill and can never say I no to this place.   I don't know about the sushi here since I always known it for just the Korean food so I will just stick to that. Anyone wanting to try Korean food do it right and go all out here!!!  Another cool thing about this place is, during spring training there are a lot of Korean Baseball players in the majors, when they are in town they are known to frequent this place more than once a week, who knows they might even bring their teammates.

I never really liked the pizza here but I can't say it is not good. I'm just a deep dish pizza guy, so i'm super biased about thier non deep dish pizzas. The pasta dishes here are amazing and super even. The most greatest of great, the best of the best here is.... their chicken wings!  Yes, my friends Boston's chicken wings are very good! If you are on a non fried food diet then their non breaded wings are oven baked. The best one is the cajun flavor. Just thinking about it makes me wanna drive all the way to Tempe to get some (roughly 1hour round trip.)   From my most recent experience there I had gotten togo and the hostess who had taken my order was very accommodating and nice considering there were countless  computer problems and disturbances. It sure didn't hurt that she was possibly the hottest hostess I have ever seen there. but every other time I was there as well I have never gotten bad service.  So, to recap. Good food, good service, great chicken wings and hot hostess!

I heard of this place from a few of my friends and I know a couple girls who work here so I had to check it out.   After learning that they have fresh squeezed ruby red grapefruit juice I knew I was going to be a fan. Not only the juice, the latte was good and the protein pancakes were amazing as well.   The food was fresh, good and service was very good. There was an army of staff working hard to keep everyone happy. I have many people come by my table for refills on water, with food and to ask how everything was.   Will have to make this one of my spots for breakfast when in the area for sure!!!

Oh after so many years and so many times I have wandered in, to walk off my meals from the neighboring establishments and ended up buying stuff I didn't need, today was the last time.  Being followed and asked if we needed anything in  a manner like we were some criminals like out of a bad movie stereotype. Wait... I'm Korean though and my friends are Asian too. Regardless, it pains me to see the dreaded Korean store stereotype  come to life but also for it to happen to me.  Asiana market, yes you are small and have a lot of Korean items I can't find at other places, your prices are higher but it was the convenience I paid for. Not anymore, as of today I will no longer step in your direction, nor look through your windows. Neither this location or the other. I am sad to say you have lost a loyal customer who had always tried to support my local business and community.   The owner if he were to ever read this or not, sir I am not sorry for this harsh review but today, your actions drove out 3 customers who ended up buying nothing and will never return again.   Will the loss of 3 men hurt your business? Probably not, but all the other Asian grocery stores just gained 3 customers. I will drive farther and longer just for that great service with out the harassment.

I have been here when it was still a buffet when they first opened. I wasn't too thrilled as it was like any other buffet. The only cool thing I thought was the ice cream selection.   Well that was then this is now...  On a very hungry late evening a fellow yelper Clifford and I were gonna meet up for some Chinese food. We were headed to our favorite spot on the east side. When I got there it was 5 min from closing and Clifford was still 15 min away. After discussing some options I made it down to Dobson and Warner to find Phoenix Palace open till 10. After giving Clifford a ring we met up there and gave it a shot.   Upon entering I noticed that the place was empty, but not common on a monday night and with all the other places in the area closing early the complex is usually dead by 9. The place no longer having any buffet tables and many of the awful decor gone it could be promising.   Seeing that their menu had some of my favorite dishes I thought I give it a shot. So some Spicy Salt and Pepper Pork Chop, Salted Fish Fried Rice and Beef Stew Hotpot.   Wow! Were we surprised with the food, especially this late at night. The pork chops were well seasoned to how they should be and very crispy on outside and juicy on the inside. The beef stew was wonderful, the meat was well cooked and the large pieces of the green onion was a great touch of flavor. The salted fish fried rice was not so great, it was very under seasoned and the portions for the fish and chicken were not a large as some places are with this dish.   On my second visit I tried a different fried rice dish and same thing very under seasoned. It seems like that the chef has very strong dishes and some other dishes are not so strong. I have yet to try the dim sum but i'm sure this is going to be very good as well.

I love this place. There are only a few places in town that have salt & pepper pork. This is one of the best places for it. I love the fried rice with the fish. As far as Chinese food goes this place ranks up there in my top places to eat.   This is a great relief to the closing of the silver dragon. I know this place has changed hands a couple time but this one is the best of yet and I hope that they stay forever. I always like family run businesses. I like the non corporate attitude of the food and the taste of the food is perfect for my palate.   The fresh fish in the tanks and live lobster look too good and I hope to be able to sit down and order one but for now since I dine alone I will just stick to my favorites.

This is the location I frequent the most often. It is conveniently located on the way to the 24 hour fitness and also on my way back home too! The staff there is very friendly and they have had some great sales recently.   The store is always clean and there is no intimidation factor that of other health supplement stores that try to pressure you into buying stuff you don't need so they can get their commission.   Their store brand products come in a wide variety of items and I always like to save on that! Great customer service here all the time. The parking gets tricky when you try to get in there around lunch time since there are some restaurants that get heavy traffic but there is 15 min. parking right up front of the store, good thinking!

I like that they have a huge variety of drinks. So many that I never can decide and end up in a panic and ordering the same thing every time. The red bean slush is so good and they put a scoop of the red bean on top. I don't get the boba in it since it is a slush and it makes the boba hard if you dont drink it fast.   This is my favorite spot to go to when on this side of town. I'll even skip the boba at Lee's when im getting my sandwich for this place.

I wrote a review about the other store location but this is the one I frequent the most. I love it and with the amount of labor that goes into this i'm glad that the prices are what they are. The long hours in a cleaners with all the steam is not fun, I know this since my family owned a cleaners as I was growing up.   Never a bad experience and always fast service!!!

This place has been open fro awhile now and I finally got to try it out. I was in the area with a friend of mine who constantly talked about how breat this places side dishes were.   When we pulled up I was surprised to see the exterior of the building. Not so appealing from the outside, neither was the area it is in. The inside was much better but nothing like some of the places in LA this restaurant is based off of.   The waitress that day seemed a gloomy and unwelcoming with her blank expressions and straight to the point service. I would have enjoyed the service a bit more if she was a bit more  enthusiastic. It wasn't till the end of our meal when we engaged conversation with her that she cracked a smile.   We ordered the tofu stew, since this is their specialty. I got the kimchee beef and my friend got the mushroom and beef. I like that they have the stone pots for the rice since no one else here in AZ does it. The rice came out a bit on the wet side but I was so hungry at this point it didn't matter. The sides that were presented to us was not very exciting. I don't know what all the hype was about the sides, it was just like any other place but a lot less. We only got 4 sides and one of them being roasted seaweed. Come on now, anyone can cut that up and serve it, I want something that I can't do at home. The stew was ok at best and did have a good amount of meat which is good.   All in all the service was ok, could have been better if my water was ever refilled. The food was ok nothing too exciting. A good place to go if you live in the area but like most of us who do not, not worth the drive. Possibly a harsh review since there are only a few Korean places in town but wouldn't you think since there are only a handful here and for some reason they all do tofu stew and a specialty that one would get it right. or at least enough for AZ but not this one to say the least.

Now I know a one star rating is harsh, and I'm sure this place has seen its good days and I am sure that I will offend and anger many people with my review but hey this is Yelp!   OK I'm sure this place in it's glory days was a great buffet, especially for the area that it is in and the old run down building it stands in. Those days my friends are far gone, or from at least what I saw and tasted today.   The place was not busy at all and there should not have been any reason for it to have been this messy. There were tables that were dirty and uncleaned for the majority of the time I was there. There was no place settings or silverware on any tables nor were there any at the buffet. I felt as if I were Indian Jones searching out my fork to eat. I had to fight my way through an army of random chairs that have lost their way from their tables and jump over the food that was dropped on the floor.   As I explored the buffet, I saw numerous empty dishes, a invisible buffet or a special one for those of us who are watching our weight. The sea of low quality seafood smothered in batter and fried or swimming in butter and drying out in the lamps. It was with this a great reminder of how horrible buffets can be. Even when the empty dishes were filled and another go around was done still nothing great to report back to the mother ship.   The hype from all the people who talk about this place makes it so much more worst since we are expecting so much more. A huge let down and sad ending to what was once a great buffet or from what I been told. Think this ship has sailed and there is no need to look back.

Where else can you get jalapeno brauts made in town this good. A perfect stop to stock up on meats for any BBQ. Their seasoned pretzels are amazing and almost drug like in manner since they are so addicting.   A little out of the way for me but well worth the drive. Sausages for all!!!

All I have to say is Pork Adobo Fried Rice!  Just this alone makes me want to drive 5 hours from Phoenix, to eat this and this alone.   I love Hawaiian food for its perfect fusion of Asian cuisines but this has to be the best fusion of all in the history of fusions.   Good thing they have 3 locations in Vegas so I can hit one on my way in and while by the strip and on my way home.

I decided to try this place out after reading some of the reviews on here. I love dim sum but I don't like waiting for the carts to come around. This was perfect. you order and they bring it to you. The menu is limited but It has everything I like.   The lady who works there was especially nice to me and with the combination of the food and service I will be back. The cherry on top was my bill today. 15 for a lunch combo and 4 dim sum items with a drink, can't beat that!

I like their deep dish pizzas a lot! The freshly chopped cilantro on top of the bbq chicken pizza is amazing. I love cilantro on anything! The best part is on happy hour the mini pizzas are half off.  Also for a place that does pizza mostly their chicken wings are darn good as well.   If you like deep dish pizzas this is one good place to get one. They are on the pricey side of pizzas so don't expect pizza hut 5 dolla specials here. Again the best time is to get one on happy hour!

This is the location I signed up at and although it is not the closest to my house it is the cleanest and newest location. The place is fairly large and offers more machines that the one closet to me.   At times yes it does get busy at peak hours but it tends to not be too bad and dies out quickly . I never have to wait for a machine and there isn't too many roid junkies screaming and scaring people. The staff is nice and always helpful. It is clean and seems very new still, I always see a cleaning person there cleaning in the evenings.   This is my gym of choice and go out of my way for this location everyday. Some other locations close at night on the weekends but this one is open 24/7 365.

Ever since I was introduced to this small and hidden place I was seriously impressed. As a Design student at ASU and a lover of coffee this place is perfect. I love the settings and the coffee. The awkward warehouse disorganization might turn some people off to this place but I hope that the coffee can speak for it. The Espresso Excelente is especially the best! Who would have thought to take a staple drink of the southwest and combine it with shot of espresso and create something so good!!!! I'm used to the Vente size and the crack head size large from Mcdonalds I wish they had this in a larger that life size to help me get my fix. ha.  The best of the best and the people there are way too cool. Never had anyone explain everything in such detail before. I'm hooked and this is my Tempe spot!

This location at Tempe Marketplace has to be the best one yet. For starters the large amounts of parking available. The convenience of the mixture of the eye candy at midweek lunch time (ASU hot girls and business suited short skirted hot heeled women!) Oh yeah and the food!  I thought to myself what am I going to eat on my high protein diet? Mexican? Nope mexican't too much carbs, but wait my carb watching protein eating calorie counting friends. The Chipotle salad is our salvation of eating with out looking like boring dieter.   The chicken salad bowl with no rice, beans, pico and salsa is perfect! Top it off with a little bit of lemon juice and you got a great healthy lunch and with a water you got it all for under $7. Yes my friends we can eat, healthy, cheap and good.   For a "fast food" like place they have a nice open kitchen that you can see, I like that they don't hide it from you and you can see how clean it is.

By far some of the best flavors. Some of the flavor combos are a little wild but they work. I love this place, I just wish I lived closer to it.

I come from a family  where we owned and operated a few dry cleaners in the Valley. Not only that we used to service equipment and sell them to other cleaners. I know the work that goes into the operations and cost of a cleaners. There are high labor costs. We all take our clothes there to do what we are too lazy to do, so why not pay that extra amount to get it done nicely. Also if we are to be so "Green" why not stop buying dry clean only goods as consumers? Our superficial society loves the good things but with out the costs.   I say as the laws change and processes change and become more cost effective the organic cleaning process will change as well. This place is going to be the most green dry cleaners you can get right now. There are so many strict guidelines that have to be followed by such a business to keep these chemicals out of the environment I am glad to pay the extra amount to help that they do it right and not cut corners to save costs like some of the low cost mom and pop shops in town.   My family now owns a Organic type cleaners in California where it is mandatory for all cleaners to operate with organic machines. If California see's that it's enough to make it a law for now I say let's stop bashing on the guys who are the only organic or cleaner dry cleaners in town and try to convert the others who aren't.  I take my cleaning here and have had no problems, I have been greeted by friendly faces and even though I haven't been going there long they always seems to remember my name. Not sure if this Thomas location in Phoenix is the same owner as the one up by Desert Ridge but they are both great!

Wow what a disaster this place was for my first time and last time.   I should have known better to have ordered sushi from a place that can't decide weather or not they want to be a sushi place, a Chinese place or pan Asian fusion.   The service was great, they were very attentive about the problem and did what ever they could to try to convince me to come back. But it was a little over board at times and made something small into a huge incident.   I ordered sushi, big mistake! I should have stuck with my ice tea. I asked if they had toro and they said they did. I like to try toro from different places since it is a great judge of character for the rest of the sushi, also based on the spicy tuna. I also ordered salmon since it is something hard to mess up.   Let's being, first I received my plate and there were my three orders. I looked at it close and was very confused. The waitress noticed this as well, she asked me why I was looking at it like I never seen sushi before. Well to start, the toro was not toro, it wasn't even a fatty grade big eye or even blue fin which sometimes can be very fatty and passed as toro by some places. This my friends was normal tuna, red in color and not the best cut either. There was a huge tendon going through the two pieces of nigiri I ordered. The salmon had black speckles of something on it, looks to be pepper or something, which tells me the chefs hands might not have been clean. I didn't even want to look at the roll at this point.   I sent it back saying I don't want the tuna since it was obviously not toro. The waiter took it back and the chef threw a fit saying it was toro. Obviously not a very experienced chef, he must have thought since it was a belly cut (judging from the tendon) from a yellowfin or big eye tuna it must be toro right?   Oh and the staff for not knowing their own product, how can a chef, manager and wait staff not even know the sushi they sell? Its something that is supposed to bring in the most profit for them and yet they are uneducated in it.   All in all, my experience there was something that was very offending. The chef assuming that because he says it is what he says it is it must be, not everyone is a beginner sushi eater and looks like they take advantage of the locals in the area of their inexperience and have done this before.You never know who could be your next customer, a critic, a yelper, a sushi connoisseur or even a fellow chef looking for a quick bite to eat while helping a friend move.   Hopefully they will have learned from this and change things up but I won't be back to find out.

I love this place. When they first opened I went here almost everyday. Well at the least 3-4 days a week. I love how there is a more Korean influence since a good and cheap Korean restaurant in hard to find.   I like the fish jun it is my absolute favorite. It brings back memories of when I was younger when my mom used to make them. I love how you get a number of sides and there are many healthy options to choose from. I have tried a number of the items on their menu and I have no complaints so far.   This is a Family run business and always better than any corporate places. The BBQ chicken and fish jun are the best, large Hawaii style portions so come hungry folks!  Perfect for Game days since they are close to the stadium and they have a few beers on tap.

I tried this place after having some serious pinkberry cravings. I didn't think any places here in town could come close but this place sure does get close.   The original tart and blueberry tart are perfect. So much that just thinking about it is making me want to go get some right now. The strawberries are always sliced into nice sizes and are sweet and not sour. They have mochi balls which are my absolute favorite and the self serve is awesome.   I'll pick this place over any other place here in AZ any day.

Ok, here it is my updated review of this Pita Jungle. I love this place. Other than their rocky start they have done a great job. The food here is great, service is great and I never have to wait too long for my order.   I have been to this location so many times I think they are getting sick of me. Ha, I love this place, the spicy chicken wrap, the Philly chicken pita are awesome and addicting.   I love that they take the time to learn my name since they see me so often and make conversation and make sure I always am taken care of. Great service and food!

Oh my oh my!  Ok after my first experience with Korean style FroYo was with the original PinkBerry in LA. It was great, it lived up to the hype and more. But it changed my life. I wanted to have it here in AZ.   It's been years since PinkBerry opened and yet still no sign of them here in the Valley. I have been searching and trying all that come here and I have found the one!  This place is just as or better than PinkBerry. I love the price, the toppings and flavors. In fact writing this is making me want to get some. The mochi toppings, chocolate chips and strawberries with original flavor is absolute perfection.   I recommend this to any person old or new. By far the best and they have multiple locations.

It is just as one would think of when you would want some good food made from scratch daily with some of that quintessential homemade flavor and love.  When there are local food that defines the heart and culture of a city Lolo's would be a big part of it. Being that many of the high end and designer restaurants and their posh play on food and trends attracts all the attention and tries to monopolize the old town and south Scottsdale area. LoLo's brings you back to the good old basics and it's family base gives you that warm feeling that makes you feel good about eating there.   The fried chicken is great, fried like no other and not like any fast food place. The portions are pretty generous so I hope to taste everything one plate at a time.   The honey hot wings with fries!!! Yes please, thank you and I wish my basket was never ending.

I kept hearing about this place from my friend Henry. But as many of time that i have driven by it I never tried it till just recently. We went there with a craving for a good burger. To say the least the craving was fulfilled and more.   The burgers are made with fresh meat that is cooked crispy which is awesome for a fast food place. The Frozen custard is amazing and the featured flavor is amazing.   I will have to go back many times as thier menu is huge and I want to try everything there.

After reading about this place online and seeing the menu I had to give this place a try. Perfect for the after work spot since it is walking distance.  The decor is nice and the leather seating in the booths are comforting and the fresh smell of leather is inviting to relax and enjoy the experience. The staff is nice and attentive.   I ordered the Turkey pastrami sandwich which delivered a great mix of savory flavors that welcomed me with each bite. The fresh cut fries were crispy and soft which complimented the sandwich as if they were married in heaven.   Everyone else at my table seemed to enjoy their food as much as I did. Some of the menu Items are priced reasonably but there are some that tip the charts.   All in all the experience and food was very good and this is a place that I might frequent after work.

This is one of the nicest and clean carnicerias I have been to. Closest to my area so I'm happy.   The prepared and cooked Carne Asada is  very flavorful and tender. The carnitas are very flavorful but on the dry side so It would be best some salsa. The prices are very reasonable for what you get sold by the pound.   They also have fresh made salsas, guacamole, and pico de gallo if you're too lazy to make your own.   The store also has a variety of  baked goods. There are some very tasty Mexican donuts and breads.   The cashiers and butchers are all very nice and helpful.

I loved Mickey's Hangover and I really like the new Firehouse. Stopped by on my day off for some bloody marys and were very good. Saw some of the food and looked pretty good. Will have to return and try the food.   All in all a great place to go for a bloody mary and chill time durring the day.

The staff is friendly but they are not that helpful. Wanted 2 for 5 deal they had on the window. Couldn't order what I wanted because the cashier couldn't find it. Was told by the cashier it's not available as the deal even though there are pictures of it on the window.    What!! No napkins in my bag!!!

This is my favorite place to go eat at when by ASU. Always good, consistent  and there is always good friendly service.   My favorites are the Breakfast Buzz, California club and the Man Salad.

Breakfast the most important meal of the day...but also your start of the day. With all that is hectic in life with work and everything going on in this town one would want a good breakfast experience.   Upon arrival for a late breakfast I walked in just before 2 groups who were being sat by the hostess. The hostess being busy did not greet me and the mod came and greeted me and got me sat. I chose to sit at the breakfast bar which had to be cleaned. The manager told me someone would be with me soon... nearly 15 minutes later a server finally came over to take my drink order. By then I already knew what i wanted to eat and drink. I ordered both at the same time since who knows how long it would be if I order the two separate. At this time if the waitress had not come by I was mere seconds from walking out. Being that I also work in the same type of industry I understand and would wait but this was pretty long wait.   After ordering, a few minutes later the server arrived with my coffee and water. I had ordered the breakfast pot pie with scrambled eggs. This is the same thing I order every time I come to Snooze, here and in San Diego. I waited close to 30 min for my order... during this time no visit from the server or anyone to say anything about the order taking so long. Again mere seconds from walking and some guy brings my order. At this point my short quick breakfast was nearing 45 minutes and I was survived by the sugar and caffeine from my coffee. I was so hungry that as I dove face first violently into the hash brown hockey puck I noticed that my egg was not scrambled but was over medium. Not just that it was a mistake over medium but a perfectly cooked to order over medium egg, now that is great if you like it that way but I'm very particular to how I like my eggs and I like them scrambled. Had we been at the point where I didn't wait forever for my food that I would have asked for them made over, but I have the rest of my day to get started. In a hungry starvation induced fit of rage I finished most of the hash brown to notice that there was a great portion of it being al dente. Which would have been great if it was pasta but potatoes...   Life was great, I met some awesome people this year and made some great memories... then I walked into snooze. I know we all have that one bad day, the day where everything goes wrong. This was that day for snooze, we crashed today... and you almost took me down with you. Well let's just say that I will be giving this location a break for a long time. I recommended so many people to this place and now I'm regretting it as I hope that they didn't get the same experience as I have. Well next time I go for breakfast maybe i'll go to Denny's instead.

Went back to check on my order from my last visit. The Asian lady helped me and she is very nice and still a bit in a rush but I was ok with it. She was super helpful. I got the information I needed and I was on to other stores.   I came back later on and ended up finding a few things, I used a living social deal and there was an issue with the transaction. The male associate was very kind and helpful, he called the manager over to fix the issue. It was the Asian lady and she even remembered my name from earlier. Got a fix for me right away and I was on my way. Thank you fashionable in a hurry cute Asian lady!!
