If you could give no stars I would...reheated cheese pizza which came out burnt greasy and flat...served on two paper plates hello what a waste and way to fill our land fills... Styrofoam cups for eating in yuck.. Coke drinker not a Pepsi supporter... Reuses seasoning jars for parmigiano cheese... Personal talk between employees could be heard not work related topics... All about personal lives on what you should do and not do...

One of my all time places... this has been a spot of mine since I was 11 years old.. I'm 40 now you do the math... Came her after my AGS games either celebrating in victory or licking wounds from a loss in my favorite Chocolate Strawberry milk shake chilli cheese fries  cheese burger lettuce pickles ketchup mayo... it hasn't changed, owners have but the food has stayed the same. ..  This place is a must eat at...

This is by far my favorite place... this bakery has been around for 18yrs... A lot has changed with this bakery... I miss their doughnuts and warm bread and lunch time boarshead lunch meat sandwhiches... Buttt the cakes, cookies, eclaires, dream cakes, macaroons, black and white cookies, the slices of cake the mini carrot cakes and brownies... yummmm. My favorite are the thumb prints and the cannoli are amazing... Go in check this place out I will forever love The Wee Bakery...

Had no idea they were closing in 30 mins until as we were leaving we were their last costumers.. They were absolutely wonderful to us .. I got chicken and steak rice salad with a warm pita... amazing. . He split my meat meat portions so I could have both..  I got a small hummus yummm with two extra posts.Very good. the combo plate was really good salad is a nice portion with feta olives and jalapeno, plenty of rice and warm pita, beef gyro chicken.. all very juicey. Not dry... Would recommend this restaurant.  The price was right for my pockets without leaving a bad taste in my mouth.

If I could give no stars I would... Waiter was rude..He needs manners. Was a little pricey for atmosphere.  Breakfast for two was 26.08$ not even name brand jelly (WHAT!! no Smucker's for these prices) on table for toast. My Spinach omelette was greesey, hash browns under cooked... Cornbread hash was dry hash browns under cooked as well biscuits were tall cake like biscuits with not enough gravy to handle the biscuits. . (Feel better served if cut in half gravy on top) When our food was given to use so was our check.. The place wasn't busy and I was going to order a breakfadt to go for my daughter.. we must of hit the sweet spot for time 9am-930 soo I feel placing what I owe with the food I purchase puts a BAD TASTE in my mouth. Will not eat here again ... This was their second chance with my hard earned money that I want to spend it elsewhere but here.

If you are representing yourself  the law library is good for copies at .20 cents a page and IF you need a pen it's .10cents.. the man that sits at the back desk in corner gave me wrong information thus causing my divorce to take longer than need be and having to do redo another step.My suggestion is READ the packets and that information... THAT'S THE RIGHT INFORMATION... not from duder pushing pencils and bothering people sitting at the tables doing their own thing.. He came to me not I went to him...THANK YOU FOR PROLONGING MY DIVORCE.....GRRRRR
