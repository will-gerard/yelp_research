Ate here again for my birthday last week.   Just can't get away from the food.   The fish is very fresh, and cooked just right.   If available, find one of the 4 tables downstairs in the small bar.  There is no doubt this is the place to wind down from a busy week.

This place makes me happy.  I love the purity of it.  Its a super small place, nestled in a retail center next to a water and ice store.  The same staff is always there, including the owner. Service is typically straight forward and gets the job done.  To me, its all about the fresh pasta. I can't seem to steer away from the Bolognese ragu. Its actually pretty light with long pasta and ground meats (7 different kinds?)   My wife usually goes with the gnocchi, which she raves about as well. We tried the bruschetta, definitely go for the fig, goat and prosciutto.  The wine list is very fair. Most bottles are 90+ and around $30-$40.  2 critical thoughts: Remove the "As seen on Dives, Diners and Drive-ins" on the front sign, let the food stand it for itself. Add fresh grated parmesan instead of the store bought pizza shakers.    Overall, a big fan of this place. Not going to impress a hot date with the ambiance, and can get loud due to small size, but its simply all about the food.

Personally, when it comes to sushi, it doesn't get any better than Sakana.  Service is amazing.  Ray brings life to the the small restaurant.   The food is simply, yet varied.  We keep returning for the different special rolls each week.  Price is very reasonable, especially compared to other sushi bars.  Make sure to sit at the bar, the chefs have great personalities, AND DON'T FORGET the real wasabi!

Certainly one of my favorite places to dine in Scottsdale.  It's such a cozy location, and seems missed by the typical Snottsdale persona. It's not about the flashy, just the food.  Happy hour has amazing prices, with drinks around $5 and near full meal sized appetizers around $10.  Outside of happy hour, the duck is my fav with out a doubt.  Cooked to perfection, it's juicy and sweet.  Don't forget the green chile Mac and cheese as a side dish!   Wine selection is strong, but not huge.  My only wish is they had more craft beers available.  If you're going to go, make a reservation, they use Open Table.

If you go into Magnums expecting what it actually is, it can't be beat.  First off, it's a cigar bar.  Expect to smell of smoke.  However, I actually go there for the drinks.  They have a vast selection of beer and wine, that they will open and serve.  The wall of beers is my favorite, just take a walk and they will chill it in about 7 minutes.  I don't think it's as expensive as other reviewers have said.  Although you can get super-high-end drinks here, most of the beers, mixed drinks or martinis are around $10.  Service has always been good for me, staff is extremely knowledgeable.  Just ask for recommendation!

I love this place!  There is no better atmosphere in the valley to compliment the food.  The New Mexican cuisine is fantastic.  It can be a bit spicy at times, so watch out.   One of the only places I know in town to serve Chimay Beer on tap!

This place is simply amazing.  Went here for our 1st wedding anniversary and couldn't have had a better time.  Reservations are a must, as seating is limited.  Since we were very excited to taste as much as we could, we splurged for the 6 course tasting with wine pairing.  In hindsight, it's a little much though.  It was certainly a culinary experience, but would have been just as nice with 4 or 5 course tasting.  My wife ended being pretty full after the. 4th course, so struggled a bit, but didn't want to miss anything! All of the little "amuse bouche" kept us entertained between courses. Overall, we had great service, amazing food and a good time.  Certainly don't go here with any budget considerations though...

Best pastrami sandwich. Enough said.  I keep coming back wanting to try something else, but always end up getting the pastrami. Sandwich comes on grain bread, steaming hot pastrami, with house made sauerkraut. Sauerkraut is fantastic, just sweet enough.  Only reason for 1 star off is for the service. Service can be somewhat hit or miss, but always acceptable.   Most of the time lunch is busy, so staff is rushed.  Not much of a complaint, but slow down a bit and would really take this place over the top. (then again it is a deli, so straight forward service should be expected).  Overall, a true gem tucked away in the least likely place!

A little curious as to why this place has the positive reviews that it does. Tried it when it first opened, but thought it was just opening jitters. Been open for a while now, and it didn't get any better.  Our waiter had zero personality, seemed completely unhappy to be there.   Glass of wine took 10 min to get to the table, and they weren't that busy.  Food was average, had the spicy sausage.  Sausage was good, but sauce and pasta was bland at best.  Pricing was fair, but seems a bit high for essentially fast food served in a nice bowl.

Decided to give this place a try since I found a gift certificate on Restaurant.com.   Had the ribs, pulled pork and chicken.  Rest of the party had about the same.   Ribs were really dry and didn't pull off the bone, but just flaked off instead.   Chicken was tender, but flavorless.  Pulled pork, well, they served us brisket.   Service was good, but luckily we were one of 3 tables on a Friday night so she didn't have much to worry about it.  Not really for sure how they think they can stay in business with zero repeat customers, at least thats what it looks like from the Yelp reviews.   Probably would have thought otherwise if I would have read reviews prior.

I've been here 4 times now, twice for lunch and twice for dinner.   I've had the pulled pork with beans and Mac and cheese each time for lunch. Pork is incredibly tender and juicy. It doesn't come with sauce, but there's a handful of different choices to add to the sandwich. Beans are excellent.  First time we came for dinner, they were out of chicken. My wife not being a BBQ person wasn't feeling trying something, so unfortunately we left. The 2nd time for dinner she ordered the chicken sandwich and I went for the ribs. As my ribs were ready, they leaned over the counted and told us they were out of chicken!  We've already paid at this point, so no where to go.  They offered to make her a cold chicken salad, which she said was good. My ribs were good, great flavor but didn't pull away from the bone like in would have expected. I'll probably go back to the pulled pork and try the beef next time though.   As we left, no offer to comp the salad or any effort to make up for her not getting what she ordered.  Great food, disappointing in the service and fulfillment side though.

This place is a 4.5 stars for me, but I'll error on the positive side.  Went in on a Friday night, and service was excellent.  We were greeted upon entry, and guy working the counter had a good attitude and walked us thru the menu.  We got the "loosen the belt" platter that had chicken, ribs, pork and brisket (split between 3 people). I go straight for the pork, but it was the chicken that peaked my interest, which I almost never get at BBQ.  Had a nice sweet flavor, with a bit of spice.  Pork and brisket were both very good, as well as baked beans and potato salad.  Also had a good selection of craft beers.  My own comment would be I thought the dry rub on the ribs was too strong on the paprika.  This is probably personal preference though.  Overall, food/sauce/beer and service was very good. I'll be back.  FYI, it's a small shot, check the hours before you go, closed on Mondays and close at 8:30 most days I think.

Luxury theater pretty much says it all.   It's expensive, but comfortable.  Check out Salt bar for a drink before or after the show. Although tough to have a couple drinks and then watch a movie without falling asleep, but at least you can take the drinks into the theater.  Assigned seats is nice, but you have to buy tickets early to get good seats which takes some planning.  We sat in the 2nd row, which was way too close for comfort.   Not an everyday type of theater, but worth a visit for the novelty alone.

I seriously can't imagine a worse place.  On the positive side, they have a good beer selection, mostly focused on local beer.  Negatives: (sorry there's a lot...) There was a 45 min wait when we got there, but fortunately found a table in the bar. We didn't get acknowledged for a solid 20 min, but weren't in any hurry (and always have a bit of patience for a new place anyway). We ordered beers and the waitress didn't ask what size.  When the come out, they are all the large 24oz glasses. Not what I was looking for since I wanted to try a couple different brews, however didn't say anything as I didn't want to wait.  Ordered food, waited 40 min and finally came out.  I ordered a simple chicken sandwich with grilled pineapple and teriyaki sauce. What came out was a chicken sandwich with grilled onions.  Ok, sucks, but it happens.  Politely told the waitress about the error and she promised to fix it.  5 min later it came back... Uh oh... There were still bits of onion on the chicken, meaning they didn't fully scrape them off.  The pineapple was cocktail pineapples and cold, and the cheese was still cold.  Eww.    Told the waitress about it, in which she wanted to help out.  Wasn't about to wait another 40 min for a  entree at this point, and who knows what they would do at this point... Manager came over, had little knowledge of what happened, which I explained. She rushed into the kitchen and came out a few min later.  At this point, we're ready to go.  Rest of my party had already finished, so there was nothing she could do.  She offered to remove my beer and our appetizer. (thanks for saving the 8 bucks..) so I simply told her I would grab something on the way home, she stormed off with no response like a pouting 3 year old.  As we were leaving, we walked by and she could only give US the dirty look.    In summary, slow service, bad food (so I hear), piss-poor kitchen, attitude of a 3 year old from management.    Feel like this place is going to have the same result as the previous places at this location... Maybe only serve beer and they'll have a chance...

Nice location, would really like to see more places like this downtown.  We liked this place overall. We went on a Saturday night, and it was busy but we didn't have to wait for a patio table. Service was good, always nearby when we needed something. Had the wings to start, but were a bit dry and over cooked. Comes with 3 different sauces, but small bowls and can't dip.  I'd skip them... Had the Chet for dinner, lots of ingredients, focused on beans and chorizo.  Wasn't a huge fan, it was spicy and no contrast, beans and French fries.   The beer is where its at though. They have about 30 taps, all craft brew many of which rare to see. They had "Enjoy By" - Stone Brewery, handful of Dogfish, Firestone etc...  Easy to pick your flight, just write the numbers on the sheet.  Overall enjoyed this new place, just going to try some different food options.
