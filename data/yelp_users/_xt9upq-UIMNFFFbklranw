The sticky bun is where its at!  Delicious coffee drinks. The  sandwiches are good too. Pressed of course. Staff is always very nice. Lines can get very long during lunch and on weekends but usually move fast. Great place!

One our favorite local places to go. Mainly for the Pumpkin Porter. ( sure wish it wasn't seasonal) Also $3 you-call-its after 10pm . Good patio for a daytime drink. All of the food I have tried is pretty delicious, especially the spinach dip. Yum!  Locals represent!

This place is so great. What a hidden gem.  Super cheap produce with a huge selection. What would have cost you $40 at a normal grocery store will cost you $15-$20 here. . You have to be picky and choosey as to what you get because everything is always very ripe. They also have delicious local breads and candies. Staff is always super helpful and nice as well.

What a fantastic dive. Great corned beef hash and delicious pancakes.  Interior is not updated but the good food, hot coffee, and friendly waitstaff make up for it. Food came out really quick. Going to try the apple pancakes next time because they looked awesome!   Cash only and yes they have an ATM.. no cell phones which was kinda nice

Love this place! I have been going here for years. I have perfected the "smash".  They have lots of new options. Everything is always fresh and tastey.  The lines go very quickly and the management and staff are always so pleasant.

Pretty much as good as it gets as far as BBQ is concerned. Ribs, coleslaw, cornbread,  peach tea..all awesome! Also the smokehouse burger is one of the best I've had.They also  bring these little doughnuts ( free) at the end that just melt in your mouth.. so delicious.  Service was great. Sit in Sawyers section. I hear Friday nights in the bar are a good time as well.

Super busy on the weekends.  The wait moves very quick though. Kinda loud but not that bad. Great fresh squeezed OJ. Lots of menu choices. Everything looked good, I couldn't decide. Awesome bacon..and they always get the eggs just right. Service was pretty good. Id go back for sure

This place is bumpin on the weekends. Great  place to shop for groceries or have lunch. They grill outside, have all kinds of hot entrees inside and a delectable array of pastries. Not to mention the hot-off-the-press corn tortillas.  Know your Spanish when you go, not very many of the staff speak English.

We went here on a Tuesday around 11am. It didn't even look like the place had been cleaned from the night before. The line moved VERY slow and the people behind the counter seemed very unorganized. One of them didn't even know the menu items. They  just throw it on the grill or flat top to reheat it. Although.. the tortillas are delicious! The rest of the food was average at best. We tried 4 menu items. When you go to sit down there are big trash cans right next to the tables. Not what I want to eat by. Definitely not what I expected from a place named "Costa Vida" Kind of a dirty, dingy thrown together fresh-mex joint. Giving it two stars instead of one because the tortillas are outstanding and the place has potential.

Golden wings and the Monaco..need I say more!!! Good place for day or night drinking.. Get there early on game days if you want to get a seat. Great specials everyday. The zipparitas aren't to shabby either. Great local sports bar.

Ya..this place is nothing to write home about. Very small place. No music, strangely quiet. The guacamole,chips and salsa were  amazing but the rest of the food was rather bad. I had the Shrimp Enchiladas and they came out with some kind of sauce not resembling enchilada sauce at all. The shrimp was fishy and the rice and beans were bland. Maybe I should give it a second chance before I write it off all together.

Fancy Mexican.This place is nice..food was good with a friendly staff.  Although we did feel rushed by the waiter a bit.  I had the shrimp enchiladas.  Very tastey. Good chips, salsa and they do table-side guacamole.

I love this place!!! OK. where do I start.. Great place to stop in for a quick lunch. AMAZING outside grill, everything is good. Best cheeseburger I've ever had. I don't even like Salmon and theirs is good. Good salad bar and salads ( pasta, tuna etc..) The pizza and sushi.. again amazing!! And........ they have about 10 different iced teas to choose from. Also, they have a great breakfast. Omelet station and all. I suggest the chorizo and egg burritos. GREAT outside patio

Eh..nothing to write home about at this place.  Everything seemed to take a long time. Not sure if it was the servers fault or the kitchen. The servers were very friendly and chatty about the food. The food was mediocre at best.   Coffee was barely warm. Don't know if I'd come back.

I can't believe im writing a review of Dairy Queen but this is by far the nicest one I have ever been to. You give them your order and they bring the ice cream out to you. They also do this fun flippy thing with the blizzards at the table.

This place is super tasty. A good find. Their spicy level is a little hotter than I am used to. I went with a 4 and almost burned my lips off. Super delicious pad thai with shrimp and the green curry is awesome. I would definitely go back

eh... the 1st time we went there the lights never went off in the theater. We had to get up and go ask them to turn them off. Also the sound went off before the movie was over. We brought it to their attention and they were very nice, apologized, and gave us a few free passes. They are new and have to work out the kinks I guess.

Best gelato I've ever had! There isn't a flavor  that I  didn't love and what a selection. The staff and owners are very friendly and always introducing you to new flavors. The espresso and milk shakes are yummy,too.

Meh..very small place. There were crumbs all over the place, the tables were not bussed and there were no napkins. The girls who were working there were more concerned about what they were wearing than knowing anything about the menu. The food wasn't terrible but definitely it wasn't great. Don't think I'll be going back

This place is a good little find. The Honey habanero wings are awesome and the honey biscuts are a must have. The wings are big and crisp on the outside. Sauces are not very hot but have good flavor.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.

This place is good.  The meat is a little too smokey for my liking, still delicious though. The regular sauce is pretty spicy. I had to go with the wussy sauce. (which you put your own on at the table) Moist brisket is the way to go. The ribs are good too. Cream corn and the peach cobbler aren't too shabby either.  Very authentic.
