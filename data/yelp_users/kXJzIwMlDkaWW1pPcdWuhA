I had a regular autobody shop I've gone to for years, however, I switched insurance companies and it was just easier to go through their recommended place then deal with selecting my own.  Turns out, Gerber is better than the place I went to before!  They really went above and beyond.  I got a text msg confirming they were on schedule.  The rental car was waiting for me when I did the drop-off.  Just really great all around.

A few issues.  First, the controls for selecting music are not really in English, so it's VERY hard to figure them out.  Second, many of the songs aren't the American versions.  So, you put in "Tiny Dancer" by Elton John, and you get live footage of some random Japanese guy singing "Tiny Dancer" at a concert.  Third, and this is the important one, check your bill and hold onto it.  I've been twice, and both times the amount on the bill was not the amount that I was later billed.  Visa was great, the refunded the "error" but when it happens 2/2 times, I question if it was actually an error, or simply a policy.

Be careful,  this place is shady.   They tax at the incorrect rate and the price for a special isn't what they charge you if you aren't paying attention.   Won't go back after several similar experiences.

Great setting.  Not the usual "penny pitcher" Mill Avenue crowd.  This is where I take people when they are visiting from out of town.

Signed up via the Tempe Bulk Yard Service program.   Sign up was smooth and price was the fixed Tempe rate.   So far,  so good!
