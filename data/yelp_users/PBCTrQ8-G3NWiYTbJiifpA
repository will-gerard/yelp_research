Ok so my neighbor had a little fire and well the smoke came into my place and I had smoke damage. I was living out of hotels and my mom's house for 4 months trying to get someone to clean up the soot. I had initially called Top Hatter when this started but for some reason I passed them over. 4 months later I called again and scheduled something with Steve. I was very impressed because I let Steve know my situation and he got me the best deal on everything I needed done. These guys did an amazing job and we're just so professional. They cleaned up before they left and even impressed my parents who both now want services done. You should absolutely call these guys if you need your ducts cleaned. Please tell them I sent you.

I recently had a first father daughter lunch date with my dad and really enjoyed the food here. I loved the half and half teryaki bowl the lady suggested and omg the shrimp ebi was so yummy. I can't stop craving this place now and can't wait to try more of the menu items. I will absolutely be eating here as much as I can.

I love love love this place! My favorite thing there is the hummus and the chicken kebab dinner with a side salad  (which comes with lettus tomatoe cucumber & onions) with italian dreassing.The owners are wonderful people and the place is so calm and a good place to take a date without braking the bank. I could eat this everyday but unfourtunately I can't afford to :(    So if you ever go check this place out tell them shortie sent you :)

I really like this place a lot for so many reasons. One it is right outside my complex and two the food is yummy but best of all the portions are very good. I love the pork fried rice with shrimp chop suey and the fried shrimp is very delish too. The staff is always so friendly and helpful plus they deliver for those days I can't even move because of pain :)

I am beyond disgusted with this location. One of the managers (Neftaly) should not be in a manager position. He is rude, crude and the way he speaks to his female employee while customers are around is horrible. I realize maybe this employee likes to be spoken to like that but they should do it on their own time. I am even more disgusted with the way their "customer support" person handled things. I was told by Elizabeth the day manager to call the the number at the bottom of the receipt so I did. I haven't heard one thing about my complaint but they were sure to call Elizabeth to ask her about my complaint. I don't know who does the hiring for these positions but their customer service skills are horrible. It's been a few weeks now of me waiting to hear back from someone and nothing. If Burger King does business like this I want nothing to do with their company. I may be just one person but keep up the horrible job and you will lose more. Neftaly can't even get a simple order right to save his life and I know this because he has failed on my orders at least 3 different occasions. I hope this location closes so another restaurant can take its place. That would be amazing. The one star is only because I am force to give it by the way. Steer clear of this location if you want your correct order.

I have been meaning to write this but better late than never. My Korky will be celebrating his first birthday along with his sister Sheeba in part because of The Stock Shop. At just a few weeks old both puppies contracted parvo. We were just so sad and couldn't afford the expensive vet prices to help them. I ended up researching home remedies and came across parvaid. The Stock Shop was the only place to carry it and well it was our only option. It was what saved their lives. Also taking turns every hour to give them fluids and force feed them. We did this for four months and both of them made it. We barely survived but we love our fur babies and would do it all again. The people here are helpful and knowledgeable with great personality.

I really like this place for the shrimp ebi I usually get 5 orders and a green tea. I love the people that work there because today i was in too much pain to get down and she brought it out to my car which was really sweet. I recommend this place for the yummy sushi and good service.

Today was my first time in Trader Joe's and I was very impressed. The staff was absolutely amazing. Melissa was such a sweetheart and made my first time experience very pleasant. I had only stopped in for some chia seeds and ended up leaving with a small collection of goodies. The store was busy but even the shoppers were polite. I will definitely be back. I really appreciated the friendly atmosphere and wonderful customer care. Thank you Melissa

Oh Dear Lord I know gluttony is a sin but this food was the bomb diggity. Mrs. White did a awesome job teaching her son to cook soul food. Everything was just like I remember when eating at Mrs. White's and I was not disappointed.  The kool-aid drinks were delicious and refreshing. Steven our server was amazing, kind and energetic.  I know I will be back to try other things off the menu and I can't wait.

Dr. Cleary is a wonderful doctor who listens and understands. I can't always make it to my appointments because of my medical condition so I cancel at a moments notice. I had my case manager ask how they would handle this since I was dropped by another doctor who didn't care why I was missing appointments. I have had no problems when this happens so I am very thankful to everyone who works here. The girls are friendly and seem to always be working and not talking like at other places. I recommend this place.

I am so thankful to RJ. He made it possible for me to buy the bike I have been wanting for so long (3yrs to be exact).  I am so happy with my new trike. Dealing with balance issues this was really my only option if I wanted a bike but I couldn't afford it. Thank you so much guys for everything. It was a pleasure doing business with you.

I ordered the lunch beef and broccoli and it was very tasty. It came with rice, crab puff and an egg roll. I also ordered an order of crab puffs which were really good and they gave me a good amount. They delivered my food fast and hot. The portions were more than enough and the price wasn't too bad at all either. All in all I have to say I will be ordering from this place again. My first experience with them was pleasant and very satisfactory so I suggest this place if you want quick Chinese take out.

I really enjoyed my rib's, side salad and baked potato with the works. The service was better a couple of weeks ago when we went but whatever. I love the sauce on the ribs and my brother loved his big ravioli  and my dad enjoyed his chicken sandwich. This place hasn't been around for as long as it has for nothing the food is good!

Frank and the boys are some of the most trust worthy people I know and hard workers too. These guys have been fixing mine and my family members cars for years now and we are a family with very difficult vehicles. He is a busy man because of his reputation but he always makes time for his customers. He has a big heart and he comes highly recommended in our family so check him out for all your car fixing needs.

Ok normally this place is on point for me. It's usually one of my favorite locations for the best Peter Piper Pizza but I was disappointed this time. I went in and had dinner with the bestie and decided I wanted to take a personal size pizza home with me for the next day. What can I say I am a Peter Piper Pizza addict :). Well I took my pizza out the next day to eat it and I was beyond irritated. The jerk who cooked my pizza burned it and didn't bother to tell me. It was so bitter and nasty. I seriously hope someone gets some new training on the oven.

I am absolutely disgusted in the manager Erica at this location. I took my mom to go get her senior coffee that she likes to order. When we placed her order I was going to get my usual iced mocha coffee but then Erica started interrogating us about who was with me and she asked if I had two seniors with me. She then asked me if I had ID. Seriously lady you are carding me for freaking 69 cent coffee??? I will not be returning to McDonalds after this. ( THIS IS AN OLD POST BUT FOR SOME REASON IT WAS NEVER POSTED)

This is my favorite place for Chinese food and they are really fast. The place is always clean and the staff is so friendly. I love all of the ladies there like family because they just treat us so good when we go. My favorite thing to get is the shrimp chop suey with brown sauce, pork fried rice and the dinner fried shrimp because the batter is so good. I don't think I have ever had a bad experience here and I like that. The food is awe some and the prices are great too. If I remember I will take some photos next time I go in.

I will be making this short and not so sweet. The food was good until I found hair in it. It was more disturbing when the manager expected me to continue eating off of that plate and expected me to pay for it after only 4 bites. I will not be back to eat here.

Wow where do I start? First we placed our order a day in advance and when we arrived 20 minutes before our scheduled pick up we still had to wait. I was also not the only one waiting on a preplaced order either. As if that wasn't bad enough, when we did get our order it looked NOTHING like the catalog order we placed. I have to hand it to this shop because they made money off of their trash today. I was absolutely disgusted when I saw the corsage with some micro mini "rose buds" as she called them. I have a gut feeling they were scraps from another order with an ugly Christmas ribbon. Hell the ribbon was the only thing you could see, the three flowers were so small. Needless to say while we were waiting she threw this piece crap together and passed it off as a corsage. We will all be calling the Better Business Bureau to report the poor service. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS PLACE!!! I would have included a picture but the flowers were too freaking micro mini for that.

These guys have been in business for years and there is a reason! The food is great, affordable and they have outstanding customer service. My family and I have been eating here since I was young and they still serve up some of the best pizza in town. They offer great deals and lunch specials whether your dining alone or with your friends and family. They have other locations depending where you are in the valley and all of them are good. I highly recommend you try this place if you're in the mood for some good grub straight out of New York. I hear it is a good place to watch sports events too but I'm not into sports so much so haven't been in on event days. All I can say is check it out for yourself I don't think you will be sorry.

I absolutely love eating at this place. The employees are just some of the best people in arizona. I can't say enough about how great the customer service is or just what wonderful hearts they all have. I now know why the food is so great and it is because these people have a blessing over them. Tonight the place was pretty full but again the service was outstanding as usual. I forgot to take pictures because I was a piggy and ate my food before I remembered lol. If you haven't tried this place you really should because it is the best.

My family and I dined at El Encanto on Sat. May 12th and had the most horrendous, humiliating and embarrassing experience. This place is labeled as wheelchair accessible but it is clearly not an establishment for anyone who is disabled. I was using my scooter due to pain issues and the greeter who seated us was very nice to take my scooter away so that it was not in the way but after needing to use the facilities a bus boy helped me by taking the scooter away and I appreciated both of their assistance. After returning to the table and getting the scooter situated my family and I were talking and enjoying the view of the water, I was reminiscing on childhood trips to dine at the restaurant when out of nowhere Robin the manager comes yelling at me shaking her finger at me and screaming about how my scooter isn't a toy and that I had no business letting her employees ride my scooter. She also said other things I did not catch because she was just yelling like a crazy woman. All of the other customers were whispering and looking at us so I was embarrassed. As if that wasn't bad enough she continued to yell and make a scene as she walked from one end of the restaurant to the to the other. Then she started to yell at the young man who had helped me in front of everybody. I had just come from a place where I felt so empowered and not so different and in one minute she ruined my mood and my view of the place. Right before she came to our table yelling I was telling my family how much I loved the place and how many fond memories I had and how good I felt after the event we attended. Robin was unprofessional, inconsiderate, racist and a Bitch. I would love to speak to the owners because if she is representing this establishment then they are in big trouble. I felt that I was targeted because of my being disabled and because my family and I were the only Hispanic people there at the time. While Robin was so busy yelling at me there were about ten small children jumping and climbing the rocks near the water with the parents too busy drinking and laughing to pay attention. I believe she should have focused on that issue instead of who was riding my scooter. She wanted me to leave my scooter behind the desk in front but how the hell was I suppose to get to the table without my scooter that is why the two employees helped me by taking it for me. That woman needs a lesson on what it is to be disabled and also a class in how to be professional. She could have come to our table and introduced herself and stated her purpose for even being at our table instead of yelling like a maniac. There was another manager there a guy but he just came to our table like a dog with his tail between his legs not really doing anything to help the situation or to even try to make it better. My mom had to tell him that she didn't think it was right to have to pay for a meal that we couldn't even enjoy but even then he had a hard time saying he would comp it. I was so disgusted I just paid for our stuff so we could get the hell out of there. I hope that Robin is punished for her behavior and I hope the wheelchair accessible label is removed from this establishment because it is far from accepting the disabled as long as Robin is there. If I could give a no star rating I would because it deserves no stars after the way we were treated so I do not recommend this place at all if you are disabled or Hispanic.

Wowzers this place is amazing! For months now I have been craving something different. My family and I were driving around friday night in search of food and talking about how bored we were with our usual food choices. We have also stopped going to some places because they just aren't what they used to be. So as we drove off from another establishment that wasn't what we were in the mood for we ended up finding a place called Little Saigon. Can I just say OMG, the staff was very friendly ( Hi John) :) and the place was clean and packed. I have to say I really enjoyed this place and the food was soooo good as well as the green tea that we had. I recommend this place 100% and the price we paid for all the food we got made me do my happy dance. You HAVE to go to Little Saigon I promise you will NOT be disappointed! Lets just put it this way I don't think I will be getting my LapBand surgery so I can continue eating there :D it's that good. Tell them Shortie sent ya.

Well ended up at Little Saigon on Sat. night too and again great service and wonderful food. I am always affraid to try new things but I have trusted John's (the server) suggestions and loved them. I noticed going to this place it almost feels like going to visit with family the staff is so nice and even the people that go in there have been really nice. It was packed saturday when we went and there were so many different types of people and I still felt that warm welcoming feeling. I really like this place a lot and so does my family. I wanted to go agin tonight but I didn't want them to think I was stalking the place lol. So if you are ever in the area check this place out it is the bomb!

Ok I am going to try and get through this fast because I am heading into a food coma and quick. So my friend and I had dinner tonight and we were seated by the lovely manager Rennie who was just so delightfully cheerful. Then we got the best server in the place Jack. I decided to change it up and get something other than the ribs so I chose the two meat combo. OMG the  pork and brisket was to die for and I was not disappointed at all. My food was full of flavor and the meat was tender and juicy you could cut it with a fork. I had chose this plate because my friend ordered the same and she made it sound so good and I was not sorry for not ordering the ribs which are oh so delicious as well. Jack was quick and on top of keeping our drinks filled and making sure we were taken care of so if you decide to dine here ask for him. When we had finished our meal we were pretty full and had opted not to have dessert but Jack was such a sweetie and came out with this heavenly chocolate ice cream cake. I was so full but this cake was just so darn good. I am home now happy and full with my puppy who is licking my bbq scented face lol. I had an extraordinary dining experience and will undoubtedly be back very soon. Sorry no pics were taken because the food was too good I forgot :) next time though.

Well I decided to give this place another chance since I really do like the food. I ended up taking a friend thinking it would be a better experience but I was sooooo wrong. I don't know what is with the women that work there but they suck at customer service. I ended up having to ask the young man that works there to take our order after three other tables that had arrived way after we arrived had recieved their food before our order was even taken. He was great as usual but it still didn't  make up for the poor service we recieved that night. I will not be returning to that place ever again and I plan to speak to the owner if I can. So if you like bitchy women who neglect you and leave you starving & watching others eat then this is your place.

We would like to personally thank Rebecca the manager for the wonderful service she provided to my brother and his friends for prom. I was given bad information for my brother and his friends for prom night but Rebecca worked everything out and was so wonderful to have a table waiting and ready when they arrived. Thank you, thank you, thank you that was so awesome that you were able to do that.

This is my favorite place to eat pizza! I can eat here everyday it is so good lol. The staff is very friendly and they have even donated meals to a few causes my family and I worked on so we really appreciate the staff here. Toniann and I believe her name is Kristen are the best managers there and always so helpful. If you have never eaten here you have no idea what your missing and now I am craving some pizza so I think I will be heading over there tonight so tootles for now.

Ok so I haven't used this service but I witnessed them working and I looked up pricing and I am so impressed. I am glad I found this place being disabled and knowing others who are disabled who may need these services is so great. This company is affordable and the men I witnessed working today really treated the persons items with care. I like the flexibility and the rates so much I just felt compelled to pimp this company out because I think it's great what they are doing. So if you are in the market for an affordable mover check this place out.

I tried this place for the first time the other day even though I have lived by it for a long time. It wasn't until a friend suggested it that I had the guts to just go for it and see if I liked it and I did. I chose the # 62 which was pretty good and I even tried a boba drink which was also very good. I love Little Saigon but Pho Avin will be my new back up place if I don't feel like driving. I really recommend both places for good inexpensive food with enough to fill you up.

Walking in the place looks cute, clean and not busy. However being ignored so you can finish wrapping silverware before seating us was not cute. My brother had to cough for you to buy a clue we wanted service. After we did get seated and decided what we wanted we were told the shrimp we wanted was not available. Then after picking something else and ordering a salad, it came dry with only a slight drizzle of dressing. At this point a couple walks in and they too have to whistle to get service, totally unacceptable when you only have 4 customers. I ordered the rigatoni which tasted like the pasta had been left out and dried on the edges. My mom ordered the pesto fettuccine which wasn't bad but wasn't good either. My brother ordered the ravioli and said it was good. As we were eating there was some chatter from the kitchen and the language was foul and inappropriate. We over heard the cooks laughing at us because apparently they had saved the last of the shrimp for themselves and decided to cook it while we were there so we could smell it. My mom got up to let them know they had horrible mouths but they never apologized. I was greatly disappointed after all the hype this place received and I can safely say we will not be back. I will say Michelle our server was wonderful and hard working. She did not stop the whole time we were there. I was also very disappointed to see the male employee who was wrapping silverware couldn't even be a gentleman and bring the chairs in from outside before he left. I'm not saying Michelle needed help but it would have been the nice thing to do. Like I said Michelle was awesome and she is the only reason I didn't make a stink about paying for the meal I didn't finish eating.

The other day my family and I dropped into Ah So and were treated poorly so we decided to eat at Yen's. The server Yuri and other staff were so friendly and welcoming. The food was amazing as usual and the atmosphere quiet and lovely even with a large group. The lunch special bento boxes were reasonably priced and the servings were filling. I highly recommend this place for lunch and happy hour, I don't think you will be sorry. Ask for Yuri she is just so sweet and helpful.

I would like to thank the GM April. She was absolutely amazing. She eased my stress and made my dining experience at BJ's embarrassment free. Dealing with a mobility scooter can be difficult especially when areas are packed with people who don't see you. The food was perfect and flavorful. The restaurant was clean and staff busy but cheerful. Tony our server was very sweet and attentive as much as possible with as busy as it was. I was very impressed with how everything turned out for our Father's Day dinner. I will most definitely be returning. I highly recommend this place.

I have been needing to write this for a while but been in the hospital and sick so this is a month late. So back in October I decided I needed a little bit of a change from the usual pizza joints my family and I go to. I had seen this place on TV (Check Please) and it looked pretty good. Oh my Hannah Montana this place is banging like a biscuit. I have pictures which I will add later but I do recommend this place for a date and for a chill night out. This place is cozy, quaint and very delish so come hungry and you will leave happy.

I really enjoy ordering in from this place the people are always friendly. I am in and out of the hospital a lot and everytime I order from these people they always ask how I am doing. They remember if I was sick the last time they saw me and they just seem to care. They even know me & my mom and always ask about her health as well. Not only is the service wonderful the food is really good too and made to order just how I like it minus or plus things I do and do not like. They are always adding those little extra touches I ask for that most places charge you extra for. I really recommend this place.

I am so upset with myself for forgetting about this place for so long. Tonight I rediscoved the wonderful flavors of great delivery food. The staff is always friendly and accomodating to my picky needs without compliant or frustration and I appreciate that. My mouth watered from the flavorful chowmain and the crispy fried shrimp I ordered tonight. I was very happy with the food and service as always. I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.

To all my friends and family or whoever may go to Pei Wei on 1619 North Dysart Rd. Please reconsider! My family and I were dining at this Pei Wei yesterday and observed the General Manager working the food line. For 30 minutes this man picked a pimple on the back of his ear and poked at his nose then touched food. We were grossed out to say the least and got a refund. He came to our table to let us know he wasn't bleeding so we shouldn't be worried. Really dude? How about the puss or gunk you squeezed out of that pimple and the sweat and mucus you touched picking your nose. He never got why we were so disgusted because he just kept assuring us his pimple wasn't bleeding. I think he even sniffed his fingers to see if the back of his ear stunk. We ended up at Takamatsu by Luke Air force Base and had better food and a better experience. I just wanted to share this so you can decide if you want to dine at this location but I don't recommend it. *barf*

(DISABLED? PLEASE READ) I am writing this review after a very long cool down period and after several obstacles life decided to throw our way. I also didn't want to share personal medical issues on here but this story needs to be told. These last 10 months have been hell and the management and staff at the Staybridge Suits did not make things any better. In August I was forced out of my home due to smoke and soot damage. I had heard from one of the employees aka an acquaintance of mine that this was a great place to stay. This person had given me a voucher to stay at the hotel so I thought this was a perfect time to use that voucher. When I arrived at the hotel I was disappointed to find out this acquaintance had already been dismissed from her duties at the hotel (ALSO MEDICALLY SHAMED). I was a little surprised because this person is one of the most delightful people and her customer service skills from her previous job were the reason we became acquainted. Despite my disappointment and  being told I couldn't use my voucher I decided to give them my business. Before checking into the hotel I asked about a handicap accessible room and if my medical condition was an issue. I was enthusiastically assured that it was not an issue and that house keeping was available if I needed any help (not true ). The room was a regular room but because it had the amenities I needed and was close to home if I needed I decided to check in. I should have ran at the first sign of trouble but you live and learn. So I get the keys and I walk into a room that was so sad looking. The curtains were falling off of the rod, the carpet was torn up so bad I almost killed myself walking into the bedroom and the couch had a slit in it the stuffing was coming out. We were so tired we decided not to deal with it and got settled in. The first thing I did was take a bath while my mom and brother got started on dinner but they quickly found out that only one of the burners on the stove was working. No biggie right? We can use the grill to cook the meat since the grill was right outside our room. NOPE! The grill was broken too. My mom ended up having to walk to the hotel next door to use their grill so our fish wouldn't go to waste or go bad. I was pretty upset by this point because as I was taking a bath I noticed feces splattered under the toilet. I was the first one in there so it was already there when we arrived. I called the front desk and finally complained. Yes I was a bit peeved so I probably was not the nicest person but the attitude that came with Joe from Maitnance was really unprofessional. The next day the long list of repairs that were needed were done while we were out and I thanked them as they were done well and I was happy. However I was not happy about the snide remarks I received from Joe in passing each other in the hall. I'll make this short because a lot happened. However I had no idea how mean and cruel the staff would end up being after my complaints were brought to light. After reporting the hotel to customer service and requesting my sheets to be changed due to medical stuff, my family and I were kicked out of the hotel and lies about my medical condition were told so that could be done. I was told I was a liability and due to the fact that I had started my period and stained a sheet. Then I was told I couldn't stay there. Julie and a person from my management company placed the call to let me know and when they thought I had hung up they continued to talk about me. I recorded this conversation of Julie bashing me and telling lies. The next day as I prepared to check out I over heard someone call and request a handicap room. Julie told her staff member to tell the person they didn't have an accessible room available because she wasn't going to deal with "ANOTHER ONE" like that. I could go on about this horrible place but bottom line is they missed the mark in customer service. In my opinion stay far away from this place if you are handicap. Oh and they also allow non handicap people to park in a handicap spaces even if it inconveniences the disabled guest. I have pictures of this I'll add later. I still haven't recovered from this situation emotionally or mentally it was just so horrific.

My family and I ate here on 9/11/2014 for the first time. I will cut to the chase and just say this place is delicious. I ordered the kebabs and my brother got the Gyro Plate with an appetizer hummus/pita. The flavors are wonderful and the salad dressing is oh so tasty. The owners were nice and lets just say we will be back to eat here again. I will be bringing my own container to buy that wonderful dressing for home :)

I will make this short and sweet. ASK FOR JOHN! He is the best and just so wonderful to chat with. He is a perfectionist too so you end up with beautiful nails.

My mother and I walked in and the place looked nice and quaint, unfourtunately the experience was not. We were sat by the kitchen which was fine if the cook hadn't been a creeper standing there listening to our conversation and starring. Needless to say it was hard to enjoy the food not that there was much to enjoy about it. The food was ok if you are in a hurry and don't care much if you taste it. I give this place 2 stars for the effort though.

I placed an ordered here about a month ago and just forgot to do this review so here it is. I had the chicken wing and pizza deal the wings were soggy but flavorful and the pizza was cold and bland. I literally ate one slice and threw the rest of the pizza away a few days later. I did warm up the wings and eat those but this is a place I will not be ordering from again.

This place is really good and the price is great too. I am really picky when it comes to eating Chinese food. I know most places hate me because I take out stuff and add stuff and get a lil extra this or that. By the end of ordering I am sure the person on the other end has already spit in my food for being so difficult lol. This place though the people are soooo nice and they always get my order right no matter how difficult i make it I love it. The delivery people are very nice too and the amount of food you get for the price is awesome.  I really like that I can get it delivered since I am sick a lot and can't get out so this place is my go to place for delivery. My favorite dish I have had is the Schezwan beef and the fried shrimp. If you are looking for a good delivery place in Glendale I recommend this place.

I don't even know where to start with this review but I will say the one star is too high of a rating considering my experience. My mom and I met up for a late lunch arriving at 3:30ish and were seated next to the busy chaotic kitchen. I had a bad feeling about sitting in this area but went with the flow as not to be a Debbie downer. 3 months ago my mom had left her glasses behind so she asked the woman who sat us if she knew if anybody had ever turned them in by any chance. The woman was very rude with her response and I tried to brush it off. Then our waitress came by and took our drink order and promptly brought us our water. As she was about to take our order another waitress walks up to her and tells her very rudely I'm here to take over your shift....and something else I can't remember now. So the new waitress takes our order without introducing herself and with the shittiest whatever attitude and just walks away while I was still talking to her. At this point I am ready to walk out but my mom is talking to the manager and trying to find out what the hell is wrong with the wait staff. The manager assures my mom he will have a chat with the girls with the bad attitude so we decide to stay. We are both trying to be positive and let things go but then my mom caught about 6 of the waitresses talking about us on her way back to our table from a ladies room break. They never even noticed she passed right by them and they continued on making faces and staring at us from the middle of the restaurant. I am now full on uncomfortable, irritated and losing my appetite and I don't lose it very easily let me tell you. So now my back is tensing up and hurting and I am having a lot of anxiety and another waitress walks up and ask me if I am ok. I tell her no and let her know about the ghetto gossiping bitches and she tries to tell me they weren't talking about us. My mom then tells her that she knows how to read lips having had two deaf extended family members and her response was oops oh. I guess she went and told a different manager something because then he came out to talk to us and he too agrees to chat with the wait staff.  Now you probably think it couldn't get any worse IT DOES! We had finally received our food and I was just about to take my first bite of food and one of the gossiping girls passed by with a big tray of dirty dishes and dishing out some dirty looks at us as well. Well needless to say the dummy dropped all the dishes. I had little shards of glass on the front of my shirt and I am sure some went in our food. One very nice waitress came and apologized and told us she was going to make all of our food fresh because glass had gone everywhere but that was the last straw. We got up and walked out and went to the Olive Garden at Metro (my review for them will be on their page). I can not believe through all of that the managers did not try to even make the situation better they just let us leave upset. I will be calling corporate on Monday because something needs to be done about the ghetto girls they have working there. My suggestion is steer clear of this Olive Garden if you are looking to have a nice experience.

The food was good the service needed a little bit of help but it was late so maybe thats why it wasn't up to par. I liked the karaoke host and the owner was very nice too. This is a fun place to dine on Fridays for karaoke lovers. I will be back and if you go tell them Shortie sent ya!

This place was really really good and Hidie our server was so sweet ( ask for her) and helpful. This place has the best pizza and wings in arizona! I do wish they had a pizza and wings special instead of it all being separate but like I said the food was great so it's worth the money. The only complaint I have is that the hallway to the ladies room was blocked by highchairs so I couldn't get my scooter in there but the ladies there all helped me get around and in and out of doors so it wasn't too bad. My family and I have found a new pizza place and I highly recommend this place. Thank you Hidie and Allie the service was great!

Ok round two for this place and of course they did not disappoint. The food was just as good and the service was awesome. Hidie and the staff were all amazing and so sweet sending us over a cookie and ice cream treat "yum" and thank you. The place was pretty full and we still got great service I still highly recommend this place (ask for Hidie) because the pizza and wings are the bomb. With that said breakfast pizza and wings are waiting for me so tootles :)

So my dad and I stopped in here about a week ago to kill some time. Hanging out with dad is a rare thing so I was having a good day but that was quickly ruined. We walked in and I was really excited to ask about paint night but I needed the ladies room first. I asked a gentleman who I now know is the owner Dave where it was and he directed me making a gesture to follow him. When we got to a certain point he stopped me and said I wasn't allowed in that section which was fine but then he looked at me and my cane and began blubbering. He said that he was recently sued and that this man took him for X amount of dollars and he wasn't even allowed to be where he was at that it is clearly marked. I left him talking to my dad but he made it sound like I was out for a meal ticket and that really disturbed me. I found him to be very rude in telling me to follow him and then insinuating that I was going to sue him like the other guy if I was to fall in that section. We did eat and the food was decent so that's why I gave them 2 stars but I will never be back to this place. I actually had to wait to write this review to calm myself down. I also found it very unprofessional that when I told the very nice waitress that I would be writing this review she begged me not to but like I said this has nothing to do with her or her performance she was great.

I was at a store near by and decided to look around this cute little shop. I was pretty excited considering my brother's birthday is days away and it looks like a really fun shop. I am in a scooter so it took me a bit to get into the store but that was ok, I don't mind doing things myself but upon entering I was never greeted. I brushed this off because she was helping someone else. I waited ten minutes and the woman working the counter never acknowledged I was even there. I felt she could have said welcome feel free to look around and I will be with you in a moment. Maybe it was just me but I felt she was very rude and I will never be returning to this establishment. I may be disabled but I am not stupid! I know how customer service works and when you suck at it it is not worth my time to return to your place of business. I am very disappointed that such a cute shop has such a crappy person working there.

I decided to give this place another chance after my experience with less than acceptable customer service. Donna took care of me and was very helpful. Thank you for the treats and for the great customer service. I appreciate you rectifying the situation. I will be returning.

(This is a follow up to a review on the 75th Ave Bell location.) After a horrible ordeal at the other restaurant we arrived at this location. We were happily greeted upon entering the door by several staff members making us feel so welcomed. The restaurant felt so warm and inviting a complete change from where we had come from. The place was packed but was not chaotic and uninviting like the other location. The staff here were busy minding their stations and greeting the guest as they walked by not standing in groups gossiping like the other place. We were promptly seated and briefly mentioned our experience and it is now pushing 5 o'clock. Taylor our waitress was so nice and went and got her manager and asked if I could get my soup at the lunch price because of what happen. Lynne came over to talk to us and after explaining what happen she graciously offered to buy us our dinner to make up for the whole thing. Now this is what I call being a stellar manager. Even though it was not her mistake to correct she went above and beyond restoring her company's reputation with us. As we sat and ate and laughed and had a good time we couldn't help but notice how the staff worked together to make sure all tables were taken care of and that the guest had what they needed. There were no employees hanging about or looking like they were miserable being at work. All of the staff members looked like they took pride in themselves before showing up to work unlike the disheveled mess we saw at the Bell location. Even the atmosphere was happier and the patrons all seemed to be enjoying themselves. All I can say is there was a huge difference in the way this restaurant operated and it showed. Taylor our waitress was outstanding and on point with her service and even went out of her way to write us a little thank you note at the end of our meal. I can not explain in words what an amazing experience we had coming from where we came from and for that I thank Lynn, Taylor and all the staff at this location . I will no longer be going back to the Bell location and will be making this location my new home for Olive Garden. I highly recommend eating at this location if you want great service.

Just got home from eating and I have to say it was yummy! The place was clean and very comfortable and of course the fry bread was to die for. I wanted to get a picture of my food but I was done eating by the time I remembered. I did buy some frozen to bring home so I will be enjoying those sometime this week. If you haven't been to this Glendale location I really suggest making a pit stop for some great delicious fry bread.

I recently went to trade in some clothes at Twice As Nice. Yes I had to wait 3 hours but I sat and talked to Maggie the manager. She was very bubbly and sweet. The store was clean and the staff all were very pleasant. The cashier who's name I can't remember at the moment (J name) was very nice as well. Over all my experience here was very good and I will be back.

I really love the thin crust pizza they offer. I loved it so much I ordered it again the next night. The wings are also pretty good. The delivery time was average but the drivers were both very nice. If haven't tried this place you really should. I have my favorite place for pizza but this one is next in line. :)

I ordered from this place for the second time. I ordered two chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals ( one spicy). It was so delicious and the portions were more than enough. We both ended up having left overs. If you like Olive Garden you will enjoy this meal. The sauce is very similar and just as tasty. The delivery guy was very nice and prompt. I have also had the pizza from here which was good as well. I will definitely be ordering from this place again. My brother and I really enjoyed our lunch .

Let me start off with the positive things about this place. The place is clean, it's close to home and staff is decent. The sandwich I had was very flavorful.   Now the not so great things about this place. Holy crap the price for a tiny ass sandwich is outrageous! Then they have the nerve to ask if you want to round up to the nearest dollar for a donation. I'm all for supporting the cause but dang how about taking it out of that huge chunk of change you are charging me for JUST a sandwich. For the same price as I'd pay here for a combo I could go eat at Olive Garden or even make a meal at home. Seriously this place is highway robbery. Like I said the sandwiches are good but not at that price. I'm so sad I probably won't be eating here very often due to price.
