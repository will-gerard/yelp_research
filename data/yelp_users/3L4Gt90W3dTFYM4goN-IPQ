You can always tell how good the food is going to be when you walk in the door by the kind of people that are eating their... Must say the people are great and the FOOD is even better, thanks for the great dinner!!!

This NY style pizza is about as authentic as going to North Dakota for Mexican Food. All it does is leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. For those of you who like it.... Sorry you need to get out more! (Maybe North Dakota for Mexican) Anyway I'm not going to say this place or that place is better, just not my taste... By the way location is great and staff is nice, and that is always half the battle!

Great Pizza, Very Nice Staff, All Around A Very Good Exp.. If I did have to say something bad it would've been about the amount of toppings (A little sparse). Also the balsamic dressing for the salad, BEST ever. I'll be a long time supporter of this place!!

Nice building, nice staff... But a little over priced, I took my two girls, they are younger 18mths and 3 years. The movie in the start was a bit much for the little ones, great if your older and can fully understand. The atrium is not to large but full of beautiful butterfly's. Kids loved them! But what they found most fun was the aquatic section. Over all OK... I most likely will NOT be back... However Not due to poor quality but mainly due to cost and feel of value are a little out...
