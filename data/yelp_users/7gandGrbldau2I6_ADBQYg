Went in for my birthday. It was my first time dining here and what a great experience it was. We sat out on their cute little patio. Fireplace in the corner and a natural ambiance. :) The server began explaining the special for the evening which happened to be an appetizer. As soon as he mentioned it being a tuna tartare i knew i wanted it. My friend and i devoured it! We then ordered the salmon entree and the pork oso bucco. Followed it up with their deconstructed bacon smores (AMAZING btw). Cant wait for my next visit.

Went in for late night grub and drinks. Enjoyed the Hummus and deviled egg appetizers. Also enjoyed their Oatmeal Stout. Realized they had one of my favorite vodka brands Deep Eddy. Shared the 2 burgers on the late night menu with my friend. The BBQ one was awesome! Left full and satisfied. Bartender was attentive and i will definitely be going back soon.

Went in for lunch and the place was quiet. Ordered two of their specialty margaritas. 1 was great and the other was not for me. Thought for $10 a drink they'd be a little more impressive in size and flavor. Server was friendly and spent the right amount of time with my friend and I. Ordered a light lunch and opted for the bowl of the Posole. Mmm! Lightly spiced but full of smoked chicken and hominy. Chips and salsa were tasty as well.

Went in the other night for the first time with some friends. We did everything family style and shared. Perfect way to try several things. The grits were AWESOME! Asked for them to throw a couple shrimps on top which made it even better. Tried the gumbo, fried green tomatoes (first time) and the dirty rice crockets. All were superb. Opted for the ribs (just ok), pork chop (highlight of the meal) and the catfish (tasty and light). All the sides were tasty and full of flavor. Tried collard greens for the first time, cooked to perfection. Wine list was extensive and offered many local AZ selections which is great. Neat rustic atmosphere with a elegant twist. Would be an awesome date spot. :)
