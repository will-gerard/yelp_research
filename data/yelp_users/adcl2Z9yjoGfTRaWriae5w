This is my weekly go to for Sushi, Ramone always takes excellent care of me an my girlfriend. They generally buy whole fish, so we all benefit. i.e. higher quality fish for a lower price and my personal favorite Salmon ribs. It's not on the menu but they generally have them. They also offer gluten free options for the unfortunate ones.  I cannot say enough good things about this place after searching nearly 5 years to find a good sushi spot in the Valley that doesn't break the bank.

I would normally give 1 star in this situation but I have had some really good experiences with ski pro in the past. Although last Tuesday 3/3 I picked up my board from a complete tune and a small amount of base work. Went up to ride on an primo flagstaff day (few and very faaaaar in-between). Board looked great, they did a knockout job fixing my mangled edges. Come 10:20 am wednesday, I could have easily broken a leg or torn an ACL. Not one but BOTH of my bindings came loose to the point where I might have been 4-5 turns from coming detached completely. I have tuned and repaired equipment for almost 20 years and have never run into this sort of situation. Yes, my board is complicated to setup (Risers, wide board, strange stance) but please for the love of god, train your staff to admit to the customer they had not properly setup someone's board.   Honestly most people would not have noticed until it was too late. Good customer service, good execution, but damn loose bindings is the equivalent of half ass attaching wheels to a car.

I have now been to los picos 4 times, always in the afternoon and never have I been disappointed with the food or service. Yes the food can take awhile but this is not Chipotle, the food is made just for you and the cocktails are fantastic, especially the house sangria.   Obviously because it is west mesa its not the greatest of locations but good authentic mexican food is not easily obtained in the Phoenix area. Ironic, I know.  I highly recommend the mole chicken and the carne asada dinner.

Me and my Girlfriend have been going to Udupi for the past 5 years with little or no complaints. The food is always high quality and the price is lower than most other sit down Indian restaurants on the Tempe/Scottsdale area.  Now that found out I am gluten intolerant the Gobi Manchurian is out (which is my favorite dish). The menu is very easy to navigate if you require Gluten Free options, the waiters are also very nice and will help accommodate almost any dietary concern. I also recommend the spinach dosai, extrra hot if you can handle it.

Great place for Crispy Duck, one of my all time favorite dishes. Any of the panang curries are excellent as well. I recommend coming in before 630 as the dinner rush can be quite intense.

We pay $280 per month for 25mb down/ 10mb up with Cox Business. They forced us into paying for the optical internet package after we had already signed a contract for cable service. The original cable service was going to be $135 per month but apparently the have a "glitch" abd we needed to use optical for twice the price and half the speed.   Our internet now is a joke after 3pm everyday, multiple technicians have come out and accomplished NOTHING! They are now blaming our network, a Apple Airport extreme router. See the picture, absolute joke

As far as hobby stores go..... Hobby Lobby is just another major chain offering nearly no assistance on ANYTHING in the store. They have a decent selection, especially in the fabric section but come on ,it shouldn't take 40 min to get an answer to a simple question.

After frequenting the original Tempe location, I had taken a break from Beavers but one day I decided to check out the new location and couldn't be happier. They now also accommodate Gluten Allergies which is a pleasant surprise. I am a big fan of the Howard Special. Which I believe has been switched to Schnitzel cordon blue in the new Menu.   The food is always top notch, yes it does take some time to get your order but everything is cooked to order. I highly recommend the Schnitzel, cole slaw, any of the potato dishes and the Swedish meatballs.

I was so excited when I found out Ike's has an Arizona location and it's only a few miles down the street from my house. I am Gluten Intolerant and this is the best sandwich shop hands down in the valley.... that I can eat at. They even ask what your gluten sensitivity level is and make adjustments in the kitchen specifically for you.   Bomb sandwiches, get one.

I sent a bouquet to my lovely girlfriend, the flowers looked fabulous and is an amazing and inexpensive way to score brownie points with your loved one. I highly recommend My Little Posy for your next flower order.  A+
