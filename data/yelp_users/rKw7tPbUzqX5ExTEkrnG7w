Worst worst customer service experience ... If you have kids I highly recommend not to visit this place. Me and my husband had visited his place with our son twice and liked the food we even recommended this place to our friends .. After a day at the park we took went to eat there with our friends and their two little girls .. The kids where joyfully laughing and talking and the lady from behind the counter SCREAMED OUT LOUD ... NO SCREAMING!!!#  as to make things anymore awkward when the one year old started blabbing out loud she said CANT THEY JUST BE QUITE!!!  We quickly got up and started leaving their place. I approached lady to let her know there was better ways to approach the situation than screaming across the restaurant and she said I won't allow people to bring their kids and scream at my restaurant so I'm guessing it was her restaurant. Makes sense why they don't have high chairs. Last time we will ever visit this place. Not to mention we where the only ones at the restaurant and a couple who was sitting outside. By the time we were out an older couple showed up but no one else was there so the one with the problem with the kids was apparently the owner . If her way to deal with loud baby's is by being an a rude adult who screams across her restaurant than I guess that's her way of doing business. They should consider where their business is located as 80% OF THEIR SURROUNDING IS NEIGHBOORHOODS WITH FAMILY'S WITH YOUNG KIDS ...

Best Mexican food in queen creek. Their location is not beautiful or fancy, it's a little old looking spot. But it has the best Mexican food ever!!!! This place reminds me of the food I ate in Mexico and the food my mom makes.
