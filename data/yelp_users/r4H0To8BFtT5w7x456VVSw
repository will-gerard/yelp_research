One of my favorite coffee pit stops on the way to work. Coffee is always good, sometimes the baked good disappoint. Still, a must stop for the coffee! My fave: cafe au lait with a shot of espresso, nonfat with 2 Splenda. Yum!

I love this spot. The exterior is a bit misleading but the family friendly atmosphere inside and the authentic and delicious food inside make up for that. I brought my very Italian in-laws to dinner here and everyone had amazing things to say about the food. The oysters Rockefeller were a hit, and I think we ended up trying 8 or 9 different entrees and were thrilled with them all. Save room for the cannoli!!!

This park offers everything for any age / kid to adult. From live music, to train rides, carousel rides, icecream, family picnics and much more. We love every visit here and the kids never want to leave!

My mom and I visited the spa recently and overall had a great experience. The facilities are nice but some areas seem a little outdated. The treatments (we both had massages) were excellent! After our treatments we hit the pool and it was perfect...plenty of chairs, not too crowded and attentive service. We will definitely be back!

This place is excellent! They always get our dogs right in, even last minute. Our boxer recently had major issues where she woke up one more totally blind. They got her right in, were sensitive to out concerns, and were all around amazing. It's hard to find a good vet, and I'm glad I found them!

So disappointed and disgusted with this place. The instructors are nice but are all college or high school kids, and the owner way oversteps her boundaries and has no idea what is really going on with her students. She is extremely rude and I actually pulled my daughter out after 3 months, choosing to lose the full month I paid for in advance because it was that bad. Take your kid elsewhere if you want more focus, attention and people who care.

Despite the bar being nearly wall-to-wall packed when we walked in for pre-dinner drinks because of a wedding, our drinks were made perfectly. Our group had fresh skinny margaritas, Moscow Mules, Old Fashioned Whiskey Cocktail, Shiso Sexy and The Cantaloupe. We were finally able to score a patio table at Jade Bar after a half hour and the server was friendly, and the views were perfect.

A close neighborhood spot for us, with really basic but yummy food. We always bring our 2 year old and she loves the food, too. I go for a basic grassy fed burger usually and my husband and daughter love the bison burger. Definitely get the Parmesan fries, the regular ones are kind of boring.

We have gone here a few times and have always had less than thrilling experiences, but the last time (last week) was really bad. We went for a friends birthday and had two lanes reserved. We were all ordering drinks it it took the waitress forever to get to us - despite the place not being THAT busy. Our first round of drinks came back all wrong and many were absolutely disgusting. Multiple drinks were sent back time and time again as they tasted as if they were being made by someone totally inexperienced. The manger came over and was still extremely unhelpful. I would skip this place if you are looking for good service and decent drinks.

Yumm! I'm so excited that they serve breakfast all day!! The coffee is delish (and only one large size!) and the food that I've tried so far (fresh fruit bowl and eggs) were perfect. Great vibe and everyone is super nice.

I am beyond impressed with our carpets. Steve came out on Friday and I got nervous at first because he looked so professional and dressed up that I thought he would only give me a quote and then clean a different day.   I was wrong! He was honest about what he thought was the best option, even when he could have made more $ telling us otherwise. He worked fast and cleaned our 850 SQ ft of carpeted space within 2.5 hours. The carpets look so much better than I thought they could. His prices are totally fair and he gives you options and doesn't push for upsells.  I would definitely recommend Steve!

I wanted to like this place because it's so close to my house, but the food was so disappointing. I ordered breakfast - the eggs we're dry, the bacon was fatty and undercooked (I asked for crispy). My husbands meal wasn't anything special either... Too bad.

This place is a savior!! I have been addicted since the first opened in the Valley and I come typically once a week. I use the app to book my early AM appointments day of most of the time. I am always thrilled with the quality and consistency of the stylists.

This is one of my favorite OTF locations! The staff is super friendly (although they could spend a little more time with 1st timers before class), but they pretty much always know your name. The trainers will push you individually to do better every single time. The gym is always clean and there is plenty of space to change before/after class.

Obsessed! I am so happy we discovered this gem at the Italian Festival in Old Town a few months ago. After enjoying the pizza there, we recently visited the Scottsdale location with a large group and had a wonderful experience. The large outdoor patio is the perfect place to sit if the weather is nice, and the pizza is absolutely to die for. We tried 7 different pizzas and each one was amazing. Great service made the experience even better. Can't wait to go back!

Awesome experience every single time!! Most recently, I brought a group of friends in for Mother's Day. Our group of 7 got manis and pedis and they let us bring our own mimosas and treats. Our services were perfect, the 20 Lounge team was super friendly and accommodating even with our last minute requests and changes. Thank you for a special Mother's Day!

I've been obsessed with drop saddle spin for the past 6 years and tried RPM because it's so much closer to my house than the other options in the Valley. The classes are a blast, the workout is killer, the music is perfect... needless to say I'm loving it here! Thank you RPM for finally opening a stellar spin studio in North Scottsdale!!!

I am so thankful for JR!! I stumbled upon his shop since it's near my new office, as I was desperate to find someone to fix my fave pair of nude summer wedges. JR was extremely friendly, he reassured me that he could make my favorite shoes 100% better and it would only cost me $45! Well worth the cost to get another season or two of wear.  I dropped the shoes off on Thursday and he promised them by Saturday at noon. They were done in time and perfect.

I've been here twice so far and both times have been awesome! Just yesterday, I treated my almost 3 year old daughter and my mom to manis & pedis. The service was amazing and they catered so well to my daughter (it was her first time!). The owner offered my daughter chocolate milk and candy - so along with getting her nails done, she was in heaven! My mom enjoyed a mimosa with her pedicure and I had a great gel mani. We will definitely be back very soon!

Really enjoyed the juice - that was the best part for me. My salad was pretty good but it seemed like the delivery of our food took pretty long. This is one of those "order at the counter" places and then you sit down and they deliver to you. I will most definitely be stopping in to pick up cold pressed juice again - it was delish!
