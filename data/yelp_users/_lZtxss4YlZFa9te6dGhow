This is by far my favorite date place, What's more fun then getting to compete against your date, build memories and try something new. With the high octane speeds and adrenaline pumping through your body your date with thank you. This place is also great for corporate events or family fun. I highly recommend this place to anyone!!!

These people are Horrible to get ahold of, I had an issue with a firewall they sold me, which I had right during audit time and they took forever to get back to me. They sent a technician out he worked on it said he had it running but then it wasn't working the next day. Do not do business with these people!

I've been here several times, and most likely will continue to come here. The food is amazing!!! If you don't mind waiting and by waiting I mean waiting to get your order taken, food to arrive, and waiting for your check. Average sit down time would be about an hour. I would also recommend not getting seated next to the plants outside (trust me). If you go here definitely get dessert!!!

My car was over heating badly so I took my car in to get it looked at, Joel the owner was able to diagnose the issue fairly quick and get me a reasonable quote to get it fixed. I didn't have the money at the time, so he put some coolant in the car to get me by but recommended I get it fixed ASAP. The coolant was enough to get me by and helped me out a lot. When I was able to afford to get it fixed first place I went was right back to him. The service was amazing and the staff friendly. they come highly recommended from me!

One of the most well put together haunted houses around which explains why this is one of the top 13 in the country! It's popularity is growing in such demand that you will often see lines that span an hour to 2 hours long. They have a solution to this problem by offering fast passes to those who want to get in sooner. One you are in you are in for a treat with amazing special effects and setups. Fun for the whole family or even date night but be sure to watch out for that snake he'll get you!!!!! For those zombie fanatics be sure to check out the 2nd haunted house in 13th floor "Zombie land" you may even see a chainsaw or 2!

I've only been here once but I had a great time, I was a little skeptical at first because I didn't hear much about it. This place has a lot to offer though, with food, games, DJ's, bars, etc. I spent a good amount of my time trying to catch a lobster upstairs in the lobster game, and my gf was lucky enough to win a gift card on the giant wheel.

The view is always best from the top!! I love the view from up top on the 3rd floor looking down on Mill Ave. I usually end my night at Rooftop with the best DJ's on Mill Ave, casual atmosphere and best drink specials. The owner is a great guy and always a pleasure to see!

This place is amazing for sports, with wall to wall 60 inch tv's and a big screen for those special games. Also the food is amazing a much higher class gourmet bar food. Great place for friends and get togethers!

Had a blast here would highly recommend this to everyone!!! From the minute we walked in the door til the moment we left we had a great experience. Although we were seconds away from beating the room the clues and challenges were both fun and challenging. I highly recommend this place
