Came here for a drink with a friend and a group dinner.  So many drink options at the bar and my favorite cider was on hand.  =)  There is an outdoor patio in the back that we had reserved all to ourselves.  There is a bar out here as well so you won't be empty handed for long.  Since it was highly recommended on Yelp and by our server, I ordered the shepard's pie.  I kept thinking of the Friends episode when Rachel tried to make a trifle and made a trifle/shepards pie.  This was nothing like that and was very yummy.  Brussel sprouts were served on the side which I could have lived without.  We also ordered potato skins which went very well with my drink.  Great spot.  Great service.  I definitely come back again.

I'm not from the area, so it totally baffles me that AZ has so many great restaurants in strip malls.  Tapino is one of them.  I didn't sit in the main dining room but at the bar and was very well taken care of by our bartender.  We started off with the $5 happy hour menu and then began ordering off the regular menu.  Lobster Corn Dogs - nice sweet crispy crust and sweet lobster mixed with the sweet chili sauce made this taste like dessert.  They also came with two other dipping sauces but I was pleased with the first one I tried.  Beef Carpaccio - I'm not a big fan of beef but this was a great dish.  The fried capers on top added a nice salty crunchy bite.  Halibut - I love fish and this was a tasty tasty dish.  Grilled Flat Iron Steak w/ Chimmichurri Sauce - Like I said, I'm not a big red meat eater but this one hit the spot as well.  The sauce was great.  The outside of the meat was salty crisp while the inside was still juicy and tender.  Hummus - I wasn't a huge fan of the hummus.  Instead of it being nice and creamy it was quite lumpy and felt a bit like wallpaper paste.    Our bartender kept our wine glasses full and even gave us a free sampling to compare to the wine we were currently drinking.  His generosity and knowledge of wines was very appreciated.  When I'm back in the AZ area, I'd definitely come back to try out the rest of the menu.

Came here for a bachelorette party dinner so we had a pre fixe menu.  It was halloween night so the staff was in good spirits and dressed for the occassion.  As soon as we placed our orders, champagne and appetizers quickly appeared at our table.  We had the hot rocks appetizer, spicy tuna appetizer, miso cod lettuce cups, and pigs in a blanket.  The hot rocks appetizer was fun since it was interactive.  All of them were very tasty.  Just as quickly as our appetizer plates were cleared our dinner entrees arrived.  I had the pasta which was creamy, truffley and indulgent.  There was so much food I barely got through half of it.  My firends ordered the filet and they all were very happy with their order.  Sides of garlic spinach, mashed potatoes, and french fries were also brought to our table family style.  I snuck a few more veggies into my pasta dish by throwing in extra spinach.  By now, our appetites had slowed down and so had our service.  For dessert, we had a mini desserts of pumpkin cheesecake, key lime tarts and raspberry filled doughnut holes.  The faves at the table were the cheesecake and especially the doughnut holes.    All at the table were impressed and pleasantly surprised with the food and service.  I wish I remember our servers name because he did a great job chatting us up and keeping the flow of dinner going smoothly.  Definitely a great place for a larger group for dinner.

I had high hopes for this place.  Since the restaurant is located on busy Mill Avenue at a corner spot I assumed it had to be fantastic.  When you walk in the decor is of course asian themed and contemporary.  This joint tries to make Vietnamese food edible to novice palates.  Unfortunately, they fall short.  This is unfortunately as good as it gets.  My fiance and I took a seat on the outdoor patio to enjoy the great weather.  There were so many items on the menu and their website that looked and sounded appealing I didn't know what to try first.  This is what we had:  Salt and Pepper Calamari - the breading was nice and light.  However the calamari was so so chewy.  It was seriously like chewing on an erasar.  I really didn't pick up any salt or pepper flavor either.  The dipping sauce was tasty tho.  Dragonfly Signature Spring Bowl with Charbroiled Chicken - My dish arrived with noodles, crispy egg roll and chicken.  It looked nothing like the pictures I saw.  Then a few minutes later our server came with the rest of the greens and vinaigrette.  After dressing up my dish, I expected to taste that authentic "fish" sauce.  Dragonfly however, waters down their vinaigrette so the fish sauce is barely noticeable.  It's the tang and sourness of the sauce that brings tons of flavor to the dish and this dish was seriously lacking it.  I tasted the egg roll by itself and it tasted like it was old.  Blah!  It wasn't even wrapped nice and tight but instead was fried with one edge falling off.  I dunked it in the calamari sauce to hide the taste.  During my dining experience on the patio, I had to swat off several bugs that were attacking my food.  A few I killed on my empty plates which was rather disgusting.  My bad for choosing to eat outdoors.  I think Dragonfly has a lot of potential to be a great place.  They have a great location and decor.  Just need to work on taste and seasoning and I'm sure they'd be a hit.
