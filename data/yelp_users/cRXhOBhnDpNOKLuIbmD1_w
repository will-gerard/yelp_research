Definitely worth it! The service tech Danny did a great job! My dog chewed up the edge of my carpet and I was worried that I might need to replace the whole thing, but Danny was able to fix it and make it look like new!

I highly recommend Empire Tax and Accounting! Very knowledgeable and they offer great service. I had my taxes done and received a good return because they are very thorough in helping to benefit their clients. They care about their clients and are very customer friendly. I will definitely be returning!

My friends and I go here pretty much every week. The customer service and food is great! I highly recommend PT noodle!

Decent food, TERRIBLE SERVICE! I sat in my car waiting on drive thru for 30 min and never received my food. I was second in line and so myself and the 6 other cars behind me all left. Also, be aware of possibly getting the stomach flu or food poisoning...it happened to myself and a buddy of mine. Not sure if it was an ingredient in the food or improperly cooked. Who knows? Eat at your own risk. But will I come back? Ehh Maybe.
