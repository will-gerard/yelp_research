After reading a ton of poor reviews online , I figured I'd write one on yelp to get the ball rolling & the truth out there... This place is actually a wonderful place to live.  The units are beautiful, the grounds themselves are always well kept and the property management company is beyond helpful.  I've had a couple service orders and they've had the maintenance men at my door within the same day.  They repaired & replaced things with no questions asked. The rent is super cheap too considering the location .  . The complex is just a few miles up the street from Mill ave & just a few miles down the street from Oldtown. If you pay your rent on time, then there shouldn't be any issues with this apartment complex and the great property management company that's running it. ... Just a tip though . Try to not get a unit that faces the east or west. ... Oh and I forgot to mention the extra large gym they have. It's honestly the best gym I've ever seen at an apartment complex.  . I even cancelled my gym membership at Gold's and still able to get in every single exercise that I was doing there. Absolutely no complaints here! Best bang for your buck! :)

Being originally from Buffalo area, I'd have to say that I'm extremely happy to have found this bar.  The wings here bring me back to the delicious wings that I'm used to! They deep fry em, sauce em, grill em & then sauce em again (2nd saucing upon request) ... I highly recommend trying out "the works" .. They mix all of the sauces together (except for the really spicy ones) - Just DeLiSh!!!   Service is always on point and extremely friendly. The only negative to this place is that it took me over 3 years to find it!! My TOP recommendation for tasty wings in the valley.

This is definitely my go to for when I'm in need of some color.  Whether it be a base tan needed before a vaca, maintaining that glow throughout winter... or even during the hot summer months when I just don't have time to lay out for hours.  Most salons down here require a monthly membership. Not Camelback Tanning! The packages are all so flexible.. & inexpensive! I personally buy the individual 7 tans.. They never expire and can be used for either a bed or a stand up.. My personal preference is the stand up.  Let's not get me started on the tanning lotion.  Same exact lotion I paid 90 bucks for in NY is sold here for 23 bucks !! What a deal!  .. Actually feel a little silly now looking back and paying so much for it.  The staff here is amazing and so is the ownership.  . You can truly tell they care about their customers... I've been coming here for years and I've never had a bulb out.   I personally drive to Arcadia area just to go tanning here.. I live in south Scottsdale.  Worth the drive for me? - heck ya! .. I'll sacrifice time for quality any day of the week.  If you're new to the area or just looking for a place where you can save some $ ... Camelback tanning is my TOP recommendation.

I have finally found my groomer!! This place is absolutely amazing. The service here is TOP quality.. Absolutely no complaints.  I always schedule my appointments with Addie. With her work, you can definitely see how much she cares. My Yorkie, Preston, was given the best hair cut he has even seen. My Yorkie-Poo's hair cut was spot on. She cut his hair right on the very first time... It literally took my last groomer 3 attempts before she finally gave me what I wanted.   If you're in the market for a new groomer, for whatever reason, I highly recommend you trying this place out. I can call in the morning and they can get me in the same day. If I need a quick nail trimming, all I do is stop in and they will take a quick break to trim the nails. Support this locally owned and operated salon - you'll be so happy that you did :)

One of my favorite restaurants in Arizona! The atmosphere, food and service are always on point. I've been to this restaurant plenty of times & have never had a disappointing experience.   I recommend making a reservation. This trendy delicious restaurant stays pretty busy.

Best Pizza in Tempe!  This trendy restaurant is located right on Mill ave.  When I think of Mill ave, I think college kids and businesses that suit that clientele. This restaurant is fairly upscale & is designed to attract older sophisticated customers. It was a surprising find considering it's surrounded by restaurants targeting college aged kids.  Great wine selection, awesome bruschetta, delicious pizza and great service.  Those are constants you can expect when dining at LaBocca. I always recommend this place to everyone I know!

Started with the fried calamari, asked for the spicy marinara on the side. The sauce was absolutely delicious!! One of the best sauces out there, even better than the Italian restaurants in NYC.  Ended up ordering the Pescatore Pasta made Fra Diavlo style per my request. This dish was to die for. Sauce was spot on, seafood was perfectly cooked. Mussels, clams and shrimp. Yum! My only suggestion would be to remove the tail on the shrimp. I really dislike seeing the tail left on when it's in a pasta dish and everything is all mixed together.   Ended our meal with their cheesecake and cannoli.. Both were also amazing. Our server was on point. A little slow at greeting us but definitely redeemed himself with his top notch service.  I highly recommend this restaurant. If you are looking for delicious, authentic Italian cuisine - then this place is for you!

Love this place! If you are a carnivore, then this place is for you. Julio was the best meat carver! He was extremely attentive, super friendly and goes above and beyond. . The server himself, the one serving the drinks, not so much. Our server was never around, always had to ask a meat carver to send him out. We went 10+ minutes a couple of times without a drink in front of us.  I would give this restaurant 5 stars if the server was better with checking in on us.  Oh and the cocktail prices are comparable to drinking in Manhattan.. Good drinks but be prepared for high prices.

Yet another pleasant experience with Tori ! ... She truly is an eyebrow artist. She takes her time & really puts a lot of thought into what shape works best for you . I highly recommend seeing her & saying goodbye to waxing !!

This place MUST have paid for their reviews. . I'm sure I'll eventually see this review being removed.  Service here is beyond horrible. It took a table next to us 10 minutes before being greeted. Keep in mind, there's only about 10 tables in the whole place.. All in one small room.  The food here is bland. Gross. The steak taco and burro we ordered were both full of gristle. Also got a specialty burro with shrimp. Blah. All bland with no flavor. For having menu prices on the higher end of the spectrum, you would expect a better location. Scary!!!   The only deserving star for this place is their salsa's. They do a good job with the salsa, I must admit.  But I don't see myself going somewhere JuSt for the complimentary salsa.  Do yourself a favor and go a couple blocks over to EL Nopalito's

I've been going to Le Bella for a couple years now.  I have absolutely no complaints when it comes to this salon. I always see Corissa & she always takes very good care of me.  I now have her cutting my boyfriends hair as well as our 3 kids. She does an amazing job on everyone's hair!  She is the total package when it comes to beauticians. I'm so grateful that I have found such a reliable, consistent, trusting, talented & BeAuTiFuL beautician. If you're in the market for a new beautician, do yourself a favor & schedule an appointment with Corissa today. I promise, you won't be disappointed.

If I could give zero stars, I would.  This business is a complete scam! The reviews below are all on point. DO NOT use this company .. Stay far far away.    The thing I find the most comical out of it all is that they literally asked me at least 12 times to tip them. Who the hell asks to be tipped!? I'm big on tipping and big on service ... If they were to provide good service as us paying customers expect, they wouldn't need to shake us down for a tip.  I can literally go on and on about how they scammed me & how shady they are... But it'd be beating a dead horse.  Someone really needs to shut this business down.  Class action suit anyone?

Went here tonight... First time in years going to a haunted house that wasn't in an amusement park.  Must say that I get a lot  more scared from the cart riding haunted houses found in amusement parks.  It just wasn't at all scary. I didn't even find a moment when I was scared or even caught off guard.  . & I did have an open mind and was pretty excited about it.  Only reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars is because they actually did a great job with their artistry.  It was more of an art/movie scene museum. A place where you can come and get an up close look at movie stages and the magnificent make-up.   So save your money if you are looking to get scared. Come to this place if you want a look at movie make-up and technology.  Oh and make sure you pay the extra 11 or so bucks for VIP 1 over general admission. It's well worth not waiting in an obnoxiously long G.A. line. NO ONE was in VIP 2, that's just a waste of money. I would've been REaLLY upset if I had waited in the G.A. Line only to be so disappointed by the weak haunted house.  Bottom line - save ur $$$
