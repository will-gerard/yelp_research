Best Pho in town! Hands down! I'm not a big Pho fan and I've tried several restaurants. But I must say, I greatly enjoy their Beef Pho. This is our go to place for lunch.

WORST Eyebrow wax EVER!!!!! The famous "Tina" everyone else raved about messed up one of my eyebrows and didnt do such a clean job on my lip wax. Not impressed at all. 5 thumbs down.

My husband and I went here for a date night. The place is very nice! Our server was very attentive and even complimented us on our attire. We were immediately seated and started looking at the menu. We had to go with the classic steak. We ordered medium rare and I must say it was delish! The steak literally melted in your mouth. I wasn't too impressed with their baked potato but overall it was a great experience! Plus it's inside the casino so we got to gamble for a little right after dinner.
