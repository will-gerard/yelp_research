Judging by some of these reviews, I believe that anything four or five stars was done by someone who went from domino's to this.  I've been to this place several times... it's family owned, it's clean, but pizza heaven it is not.  Their pizza is good and nothing more.  I liked it, but it wasn't out of this world, I had the Pizza Bianca and it does not deserve 5 stars. It's OK. that's it.  I really don't understand how places like this on yelp get such high reviews, but I have a theory:  People who do not venture out beyond their safe zone develop a relative reality.  Let's just say this about Pizza Heaven: There wasn't anything bad about the place.  They have music sometimes, but it's a duo fronted by the owner's son.  They're so-so, just like the pizza, no wrong notes, but I won't be buying their album soon.  I wouldn't come here unless I was invited by someone, in which I would still come, but I can think of 20 pizza places that are better than this and many of those 20 are cheaper.

I used to crush this place when I was veg. It's run by a cult, but if you can get past that it's in the house.  The lemon grass chicken almost had me convinced they were lying about it being vegetarian.  Service is relaxed not slow to clarify on other reviews.  It is especially good to hit up during lunch... really cheap then.  They also sell a lot of their faux meat products if you want to do some home cooking.  Rock the lemon grass chicken and the house chicken they are spot on and safe for non adventurous eaters.  PSA- they're closed from 2:30-5pm between lunch and dinner.

Rock the Rivas!  It's _bertos clone type shop.  Everything is good and fresh...   It's cheap and quick.  Their Carne Asada is better than amado's and filli b's.  Hit it up after you're nice and drunk from rocking out at the Yucca Tap Room!

Just don't go here... This was the worst Carne Asada burrito I've had ever!!!  The place is a shite hole, their rolled tacos are over priced and not so good... They even messed up a veggie burrito.  Also, their guac was all dark like it was left out.  I spent 15 bucks here and me and my gal ended up making mac and chac at home.  I really can't explain how much of a fail this place is.   How can you be levels worse the Filli B's?    Not to mention it's like $0.50-$1.00 more expensive than any other Taco shack in Tempe.    I could see that it's family owned by a couple, and I feel sorry for raining on them, but how do you mess up Carne Asada????!!  Do yourself a favor if you're on Southern and have a burrito hankering.  Go to Rivas.

Word to the V jobs.  5.75 for a drink and 2 slices or a slice salad and drink...  I must hit this joint up 3 times a week.  it's so affordable and the pizza is legit.  Slices are large and they remodeled it, so it's comfy.  The slices are large and in charge.  May I suggest trying one with green chile and with Feta.  They hook up the tables with Garlic, Oregano, Parmesan and Peppers for you delight.    Go here now!

This is the most real review on GC here, so read on:  Guitar Center is a festering disease that needs to be stamped out.  It's the wallmart of music stores.  It is employed by world class douche nuggets that think, just cause they work at guitar center, that they have some type of credentials in regards to gear purchasing.  Being a professional musician myself, I try to stay away from GC at all times in order to maintain sanity.    Reason 1 As a professional musician, I find that GC doesn't carry anything I would purchase other than drum sticks, gig bags, and miscellaneous items.  Never will I buy a drum set, for they do not carry sizes outside of the butt-rock/heavy metal spectrum.   Never will I buy a cymbal from there, for they have none that sound good, and if there is the chance that they may have an ok K zildj, it's monstrously overpriced.  They don't even carry the drum heads I use.  Reason 2 The douchebags.  The last thing I need when I'm coming in to pick up some sticks, or a hardware accessory, is dude telling me what he thinks I should buy.  Usually I try to be nice, but once in a while I have to go off.  Like: "You should check out the Dennis Chambers Stick", says Guitar Center Douche. "No thanks, I like those peter erskine ride sticks quite fine", me. "I'm telling you, if you're doing Jazz, those Dennis Chambers sticks are the way to go.  I always use them when I play Jazz." Guitar Center Douche. "Oh really, when's that, at your house at night, cause I've never seen you out at any of the clubs playing." Me. "yeah, well I mostly play metal." Guitar Center Douche. "Yeah, will I mostly play jazz, as my job, so don't try to upsell me on sticks." Me.  This reasons is echoed throughout every musician I hang with.  The most recent horror story was about my friend try to buy a PRS guitar from them that they accidentally sold while it was on hold for him.  The floor clerk had this to say: "Sorry about that dude, how about I go grab a strat of the wall for you."  If you play guitar, then you know someone shopping for a PRS probably doesn't need another strat, and you'd think a professional guitar salesman would know too.   Reason 3 They treat their product like shit.  I don't know how many times I've heard of people getting drum sets, and the dude wheeling out a damaged box, saying the drums are fine, only to find the shells being damaged when they got them home.  Also, I've seen one of my buddies go through 4 different premier kits, because the shells were out of round.  The GC dude says it must be the boat ride, we called Premier, and they said they ship all their kits via airplane.  If you buy a guitar there, take it into a luthier immediately, because GC doesn't tech any of their gear, they just put strings on and hang it on the wall.  Reason 4 Guitar wanking in the store...  There's nothing that makes me want to beat my head into a wall more than 3 to 6 dudes demoing guitars playing Metallica licks really badly.  This also goes for really loud crappy drum solo guy and couldn't play a melody on keyboard piano dude.  Reason 5 Their Pro Audio section is the least pro I've seen.  It's like mid grade.  Poor mic selection too.  Reason 6 Their online service has much better selection, way better prices, and a better atmosphere.  I understand that all the good ratings are coming from people that don't have such a critical sense of musical gear, but this is understandable for weekend warriors and hobbyists.  As a professional musician, I stand behind local shops like Milanos, where one can get some personal service from a dude that really knows his shit about drums, and pay into the community rather than this megalithic Douche Center.

I used to rock this joint on lunch at Moon Valley High School across the street.  This is the best -bertos type place in the area, not fili b's, not Ramiro's, not Rolando's.  Humberto's.  Best Carne Asada in the area.

Nothing to see here really.  Not much on tap beyond the white trash specialties.  The menu is huge, so much so that it's convoluted.  They're just trying to do too much.  The service usually blows, cause it's staffed by burned out looking skanks, and I'm being nice here.  On the weekend it packs full of douchebags who are engaged in mortal douchebaggery.  it's the kind of place you could get into a fight in when you're not looking for trouble.  Everyone seems to be posturing around here.  I remember when this place first opened up before it expanded 3 times.  It started as an old dudes sports joint now it's a drink special douche attractant.    I wouldn't go here unless forced to.  Ohe yeah the drinks aren't cheap here either, unless there's a special.

If ye on thee west side, ye must indulge thine's hunger with Pizza by Napoli.  This is your basic pizza joint.  Nothing special, just damn good NY style pizza.  They have cheap lunch slice specials.  Anytime I'm over in this area I'll hit up a couple of slices here... they still remember me from when I lived in the area and it's been like 3 years.  Ironically, the family that owns it looks mobster like, but they're from Albania, not Sicily.

Go here to buy musical stuff, whether it be for orchestral, rock and roll, Jazz, or Latin.  They have a great, diversified selection of stuff.  The drum department is great, they even get Constantinoples, and other high end cymbals in there.  They have a massive drum head selection, and decent amount of good drum kits in varying sizes.    The place will factory order things that you need if they don't have them in stock and they will price lower than competitors.  All of this with a friendly educated staff, not clueless douche rockers like Guitar Center.   It's a family business and has been in the valley for years... I remember my first music folder in band in 3rd grade being a Milano's music folder.    I go here to rubberneck, cause Guitar Center is too softcore.  Go buy some shits here and jam out with your clam out.

One word here - Burgers  The open faced green chile burger is supernaturally good.  I think I'm possessed by a green chile demon from eating it.    The Patty Melt is uberbomb too.    I haven't ventured far from the burgers, but I know the Chile Rellenos are solid as is the Blue Corn Enchiladas.

I am a die-hard Grimaldi's fan.  This Scottsdale location is the best one hands down.  It's Neapolitan style pizza, cooked in a coal fired oven, with fresh mozzarella sliced on it.  I've always been satisfied when I've went here.  The toppings are fresh, a bit pricey, but the pizza here isn't supposed to be loaded by design.    I always suggest getting extra cheese, because I'm a sucker for bomb fresh mozz.  The sauce is perfect as well.

Four Peaks baby.  This spot is awesome.  Great place to meet up with a crowd, grub, and pound some craft brew.  The food is great: dope appetizers , rockin' burgers, decent pizza, and daily specials.  The beer is fantastic, hop knot being my fave.  They have happy hour everday from 3-7 and 10-close with dollar off beers, a light night menu, TV's, and a pool table.  I've gotten mashed here more than a few times.  Sunday brunch is killer, and may I suggest you try the Stout milkshake, a little known secret, but good for the sweet toof.  Don't miss out on the Peaks.

I don't know why people hype this place so much.  The bread is usually stale.   Just because they blantently propagandize herb doesn't make it good.  Subway is just as legit.   Plus it's a bit dirty.  What do you expect from an entirely baked work force.  If you find yourself in the vicinity of cheba hut, go to the Pasty.

This place is good to go to if you're hungry and stumbling drunk at 2 am...  At that time your taste buds aren't quite on their game, so you won't detect your money being wasted.  Also, your massive hangover will mask the gastrointestinal impact of Texano's dodgy mexican food.  Really, I know this is a _bertos type of place, but I have been to better and not many worse.  It stinks like a rotten corpse outside of the place, and last time I was there they didn't accept cards.  i don't know if this has changed, nor will I, because I don't plan on returning.    Also, I have noticed the ill effects of eating at this joint the day after and so have some of my comrades.  If you're near here and want a burrito do yourself a favor... go to Rivas.

This is the breakfast spot in Tempe!  Bomb Huevos Rancheros, killin' biscuits and gravy, fatty omelets, what more do you need?  A no frills old school breakfast stop.    Did I mention that the place is staffed by some very attractive women, cause that's a plus in my book.  This is the Sunday morning hangover stop.

I'm an avid listener of Jazz and a musician and I'm not too into KJZZ.  Yes they play a lot of the Jazz classics and even some new stuff, but it seems that it's all in the vein of straight ahead or vocal jazz.  I rarely hear anything experimental.    The station's understanding of New Jazz is far off.  I rarely hear any Mehldau, don't think I've heard a Redman or Rosenwinkel track, and bet your ass they won't drop some Kneebody or Wayne Krantz.  I can understand why they program in this manner, because they're probably not trying to alienate their base of listeners in sun city.    Anyways, I'd rather listen to NPR then Blaze spinning kind of blue for 12 hours straight.

Can anyone say thin crust pizza...    Everything on the menu is great, but I'm addicted to the thin crust pizza.  Tap Beer is around 4 bucks a pint, so getting your drink on isn't to expensive either.  My only gripe, which illustrates how good this place is, is that it is packed every time I go there.    Word to the pizza cookie too... If you have the room, this will ensure a heart attack by mid evening.

This is a world class comedy club.  Every time I go here I end up smashed and laughing my ass off.  2 drink minimum of course, but that is expected.  They bring in the creme de la creme of comedy in here.  I saw Joe Rogan and was rolling on the floor almost.    The food is pretty deez, but this is a comedy club and anyone with half a brain would hook up dinner before the show.  Drinks aren't too pricey, and actually cheap in respects to being sold in a venue.    Check out their website and roll in one night when a performer you dig is there, you won't be disappointed.

Best Irish Pub in Tempe.  Usually has Live entertainment on the busy nights.  It is super pricey, so I would suggest pregamming it at the house or a dive before you make a night out of this place.  Happy hour is a smokin deal for food, which is excellent by the way.  Hit up the fish and chips or any of your Irish faves...

This is the joint to hit if you're veggy or vegan.  The Faux meat is good, and they have a wide selection of faux dishes.  Oh did I mention the vegan crab puffs... they are amazing.  It's worth stopping in for an order of these alone.

The Haj is a dope spot.  You can shop here and eat.  It's very very affordable.  I like to hit it up for lunch when I'm short on ends.  They use the bomb feta, which you can buy in a tin.   It's Veg friendly, and their Gyros are good.  Thumbs up!

They should rename this place to Lame Tuesday or Douche Tuesday.  They serve foo foo slushy drinks that are mediocre at best. The place blasts the most annoying music so loud, that the coffee plantation shakes at night.  I usually get "want to fight eyes" from the steroid club that's hanging out on the patio every time I walk by.  I want to reopen this place as "The Home Depot", cause it has the most tools you have seen under one roof.  To add insult to injury they charge a cover on  weekends, like paying 8 bucks for a 24 ounce cup of ice and shit isn't bad enough.    The only redeeming deal they have is $1 for a shot of 151 rum in your cup... of course it isn't Bacardi 151, but some grain alcohol off brand.    If you are here spend like $10 on those extra shots, because it will help keep you from slashing your wrists in the bathroom.  Another upside to this place is that after a night here, if you vomit on a a really big piece of a paper and leave it out all night, you might be able to slang it at an art gallery as modern art.  "This place is good... for me to poop on."

What can I say... Tops has the location and the selection.  Whether you want to drink cheap on naty ice light and boone's farm, or get all snooty with some Belgium beers, fine wine, or high end spirits, Tops has got your back.  The dudes that work there are cool and now their stuff.  They know the stock, where it's at, and can give a good suggestion to an overwhelmed prospective buyer... the amount of booze in this place pretty much stops everyone in their tracks the first time they roll in.  Top's pricing competes with circle K's and supermarkets as well.

It seems like the reviews on here about House of Tricks bounce between meh and mind blowing.   This place is a solid 4 stars.  You're not going to find anything in Tempe that really competes on this level, as even the nicest places in Tempe are corporate balloon knots and do not offer a true fine dining experience like Trick's.  I went here with my lovely lady on a Friday night and posted up at the bar.  The bar is tits and it's outside with trees growing out of it.  It has this Swiss Family Robinson type of vibe that's really cool. The entire property is a couple of buildings and the patio/bar, and it's a cool setup.  The food selection is legit, with a hefty portion devoted to seafood.  We dove into the seafood and got an order of the scallops and an order of the mussels. The scallops were legit.  Cooked perfectly, presented beautifully and garnished thoughtfully.  The Mussels dish was also a winner: Mussels were fresh and cooked well, and the sauce was just awesome with the sausage in it.  I devoured it.  Overall, I couldn't see why anyone would give this place any less than 4 stars.  Go now and eat some scallops.

Great dinner destination for a date.  They usually have live music, which can be really good, especially if my group is playing, lol.  They always have a dope wine selection, and their specials are usually top notch.  The vegetarian lasagna is killing and the Pola Pola with the sauces mixed is to die for.  Parking is a complete pain on the weekends.

I cannot get enough of this place.  Especially when I was hipped to the Thai hot secret.  It's very inexpensive, and they have the best Thai Iced Tea, which I could drink 3 glasses of if I didn't know any better.  I can't stop rocking the red curry.

This bar is the coolest hang bar in valley.  I liked it so much I moved across the street from it.  The patio is huge and usually always buzzing with drunks and attractive women or the ever coveted hybrid of those two groups.  They have a decent tap, and the place is relatively well priced.  It seems to be the central nodal point of the Tempe hipster scene.  I met a lot of people through there.  A good place to go if you're single or as a couple.  If you're a guy, you even get to piss in their "blarney stone".   The bartenders are super cool, and make seriously stiff cocktails.  Go there, tonight.

Being a native Phoenician, I have a junkie like addiction to mexican food.  I find Someburros to be quite satisfying.  It is not a _bertos clone, so don't go expecting carne asada like you're used to.  It has a more authentic menu, that isn't all that authentic, but more so than _bertos.  The Pollo Fundido is indeed delectable and decadent.  The three way burro is scrumptious and may I suggest a cheese crisp with green chiles, which is my personal fav.    It's a bit more pricey than _bertos, but well worth it.  Call in your order and they have a pick up window.  You can't beat convenience.

I believe this place lives up to all the hype it has received.  It's a well know fact that it's beyond busy, so whining about it isn't permissible.  You can chill in the little house next to it or in the front and booze it up a bit before you dine.    The place is the real deal though.  It's all done by Bianco, the ingredients are fresh and some local.  The attention to detail and quality is superb.  The flave, well it is monumental.  All the listed pizzas are legit Italian style or artfully put together.    I wasn't surprised one bit that it was the Bomby McBomb.

This place is very good.  I've been here many many times and can attest to it being consistent too.  There's a variety of Italian dishes, salads, appetizers, and personal size pizzas.  It whoops up on anything in a 5 mile radius for Italian.    I'm a personal fan of their rigatoni smoked chicken entree. Other contenders are the Tortellini Principesa, the gnocchi with blush sauce, and the 4 cheese pizza.  They often offer a fresh seafood entree special, which will always be fantastic.    The owner Vince is ultra nice and is usually chef'n it up in the back, so quality control is top notch.  They also have Bira Morreti on tap.

Ugggghh, what can I say about Chino Bandido...  It's a shit hole on 19th and greenway in a dumpy shopping center.  The food isn't really that good, and the place is not clean. My friend raved about this place, so I went with him... I even ordered his suggestion, some chicken bowl thing.  The chicken was grizzly and the serving wasn't even that big for what I dropped.    I think the idea of the place is cute, but the execution isn't there.  I mean, a filiberto's or a cheap chinese joint destroy this place, and you could buy a burrito and a chinese combo at both together for only a few dollars more than a combo at Chino Bandito.  I just do not understand why people like this place.

I've been trying to perfect the neapolitan pizza on my own time, so when I first went here, I of course went for the Margherita... Of course I have since tried many of their pies, but I want to focus on the most pristine of their pies, as if you don't have that nailed, you have nothing.  Component wise this pizza was top notch.  The crust was leopard spotted, perfect hydration for their oven, salted cornichone... Just perfect.  The sauce was excellent.  Not sweet, fresh, tangy, bomb.  Their mozzarella is milky goodness, and they throw the fresh bail on last after it's cooked. Magnifico!  People go around talking about their favorite pizza spots and it always boils down to some certain pizza configuration; however, a true pizza person must see through this fluff in order to see the true greatness.  Cibo has the right oven, the right temperature, the right wood, the right bakers ratios in use on their dough, fresh ingredients, and elegant flavors.  Don't get fooled into this pie or that.  Get into perfection.  Get into Cibo.

I have a huge throbbing wood for this place...  I love their pizza and this location is on the up and up. Always order extra cheese because you cannot get enough of their fresh mozzarella... May I suggest basil and sausage too.  You really can't go wrong with this place.  I would give them 5 stars if they inserted an awesome tap into their mix.  That's about all I have to say about that.

I played here on New Year's Eve and never knew the place existed before.  They have live music on Fridays, salsa in variety.    I was eating off the New years menu and ordered the Duck.  In short it was gangster.  Cooked to perfection, just under medium, masterfully seasoned, artfully presented.  All the other things I saw were inline with my entree.    After the New Year's festivities, the owner whooped up a smorgasbord of items for the band, Djs and employees to reconstitute themselves on.  Being New Years, and having stopped playing by 10, my memory of the specifics of the smorgasbord items is vague at best, but my memory of my tongue's and tummy's delight isn't fractured.    I truly believe this place to be a nugget.  It's owned and operated by really cool people, the food is crazy good, it's cozy, great bands... what more do you want.  Oh and for those who worry about the parking, I have been informed that they own the lot diagonally across from their establishment.

This theater is the nugget.  It has all the movies you want to see here... that is if you're cool, cause they don't show B.S. flicks here.    I saw Requiem of a Dream and Apocalypse Now Redux here, just to give you a snippet of the tasty morsels they show here.

"I give it four thumbs down."  This place is an enigma to me.  For some reason, people rave about this joint.  I've been here twice and felt like I was being shafted when I ended up paying money for the garbage they served me.  At first glance the place looks promising, sporting your basic mexican menu with all the classic combinations.  However, upon ordering an enchilada, flauta, or taco, this joint nose dives.  Bland is the best way to describe this place.  The salsa is laughable, and the "hot" salsa isn't even one alarm.  They don't offer a real bar or much beer, so try their "margarita" thing for a huge disappointment.    I can't understand why this place hasn't gone belly up, but I guess that's why I can't understand folks promoting the joint either.    Fili B's is better than this, no lies!  Anyone giving this place 5 stars should be grounded from yelp for a month because there is no way that this place deserves it.

This is the ASU music school break spot.  The coffee is decent, and service is usually good.  They offer all kinds of veg fare and hitting up an egg sandwich in the morn is usually more than satisfying.  Go here instead of Starbucks you corporate junkies.

Can you say schnitzel?  I love the Haus Murphy's.  Their newer location is bigger, so dinning with a group is a breeze now.  The food is awesome.  The sausage is top notch, the sausage  platter is obtuse.  I'm a schnitzel addict, so I always entertain one when I visit.  The Bread Pudding is fantastic, but as is all the dessertery.  It's a German place and the one pasta dish they have there is even killing.  It's a bit expensive, but worth it in every way.    For the drinkers, it's a little bit of heaven.  They always have about 5 German beers on tap usually Franziskaner WeissBier, Warsteiner Dunkel, Spaten Optimator, A Weistephaner, and a Pilsner of German origin.  I used to hit up the happy hour here on a reg and deplete them on mustard and pretzels.  They also serve beers in the huge mugs if you're a drunk or just like big things.

Hail the Pasty.  This place rocks so much I can't even put it into words.  It is definitely one of the places in the entire valley that I recommend to travelers.  Everything is made right there, in front of you almost.  Their selection is vast and pretty much everything is awesome... I suggest the Reuben.  Desserts are good, check out the banofee pie.  Hoegaarden on tap plus others, and the kicker $3 car bombs all day everyday.   We have a winner.  This spot is legit!

What can I say, I'm light rail hard.  I'm a public transportation junkie.    It has kind of replaced the red line if one is on a venture to the depths of the west side.  It is much quicker than taking a bus.  It goes from Tempe to Downtown Phoenix, which is the ride I'm abusing right now.  It runs smooth, and I only saw it be incredibly packed on the first days of it's opening, when everyone had "light rail fever".  The fare for it is cheap and the all day works on the buses too.  There's really nothing I can say bad about it other than that I want more.  More distance, more directions, more light rails.  Don't let the petro-chemical anti-environment puppet masters control you and take the light rail.

I have a long history with this place, which is where I worked my first job at 16.    It's run by two Sicilian immigrants and there 2 sons.  Originally the owners had a joint in NY, but moved to the valley and opened this place.  They run a military style kitchen where cleanliness is enforced to a maximum.  Almost everything is personally overseen by one of the two owners.  They offer a regular Italian menu...  the regular pasta choices, nothing too fancy and no Alfredo entree. They have some meat entrees with veal and chicken.  The pizza is NY style and really good and rich. They offer a Garlic and Olive Oil pizza that is so good.  I get it with pepperonchinis on it.    The crust on the Sicilian pizza is the best I've had.   Sometimes I just crave a small cheese pizza from this joint.  The Eggplant Parmesan is in the house here, but everything holds it's own.  It's priced ridiculously well, so much so, that the senior citizens roll out from Sun City all the time.  They have a few beers on tap, all domestic, and some decent wine, but nothing fancy at all.  The bottom line is that the food is good and cheap and the place is real.

I'm a fan of Yucca.  Clown Shoes is always fun to come sit in on.  The music can be come and go, but at least there is plentiful amounts of it.  It's usually pretty dark and there's always a crowd smoking outside.  Nice and divey.    Cash only, $2 PBR's in a can.

In-N-Out represents the burger.  Fresh cut fries, oh yeah.  Dropkicks any fast food burger chain.  Most likely to be crowded because of this.  The drive through takes a minute too, but the real deal with In-N-Out is the secret menu.    Watching a friend eat a 4x4 animal style is impressive, so be hip to the secret menu and rock yourself a flying dutchman.

I'll give it to Sacks.  I think their sandwiches are great.  I love the Van Gogh and the impressionist.  They make 'em thick too.  They also give you a cookie that's quite bombtatsic with every "sack".  My only gripe is their hours, cause I've wanted a wich a few times after 3 and they're closed.

Bomb burritos, clean, good chile relleno, open late night.  What more do you want?  Much better and easier on the digestive tract than Fili B's

Best coffee in Tempe hands down.  Cool little place too.  I used to work at a roaster and this place knows what's up.  Owner is a drummer too, so I like the place even better.

Cork is an enigma.  What makes it enigmatic is how damn good it is... Too good for Chandler and maybe too good for the valley.  The portions are just right, and anybody that tells you otherwise is a fat ass or a glutton (I'm 6'3, 200lbs. and I was satisfied).  If you want large portions though, go to their lunch/brunches.  I've been there twice and had The Lamb Chop, which was amazing on all levels, and I've had some serious lamb in rural Bosnia, which has been labeled the best in their country... sure enough cork's stood up blow for blow.  The other entrée I experienced was the buttermilk fried chicken.  I was so amazed by the lamb the first time, that I had to try something more "simple" in order to qualify their food in regards to regular places.  Let's just say the chicken was not regular, it was outstanding.  The appetizers are crazy good... can anyone say king crab legs?  The wine selection is top notch.  the booze selection is killin, and they even make this amazing Italian lemon stuff that's like 90% alcohol.  make sure you have a designated driver, because this place will inspire winos and boozers to indulge to their fullest.  Go to Cork, because it's that damn good!

The Parlor is a hip spot.  The beer selection is legit, the place is clean and furnished nicely, and the staff are great.  Since this place is a pizza spot and has some clout to it's name, I had to check it out.  Pizza is type of food that requires absolute attention to detail in it's execution to cross the line from good to excellent. It doesn't matter how many awesome topping combinations you can come up with, it must come down to the core of the pizza itself, as you could just throw those toppings on a sandwich with the same results if the fundamentals of the pizza aren't nailed.  This is where the parlor falls short.  When I roll into a pizza spot like the parlor, I always go for the Margherita.  It's super simple, so unless it's prepared by a deft hand, it will be average; however, if it is prepared by someone with some skills, it will blow your mind how incredible such a simple pizza can be.  ...So, I went for the Margherita and I was not impressed at all.  The crust is unexceptional.  The overall flavor of it was reminiscent a place like Barro's, under salted, a little sweet from something like sugar or honey added in, and maybe even some oil.  True masters can take Flour, Water, Yeast, and Salt and put together a crust that will peal your lid off.  Also, the hydration was pretty low, I'd say 50-55%, which means they have their ovens at lower temps.  My crust was just barely cooked though, with no real color or any char on the cornicione.  It was just spongy and bland, which is not the launch pad for amazing pizza.  The toppings, the toppings... I think of Marlon Brando's character from Apocalypse Now saying this.  This Margherita is a disgrace.  They just put sliced heirloom tomatoes on this thing.  I love heirloom tomatoes, but this just irks me on three levels:  1. Sliced tomatoes on pizza that aren't par roasted just piss water all over the pizza.  2. For it to be a Margherita they're traditionally supposed to be blanched then hand crushed. I'm not some type of stickler for rules, but if you're going to go rogue, you gotta make it amazing. Adhereing to the crushing of the tomatoes, with the insane high heat of the oven (which this place doesn't have), will create these cheese/tomato chimera areas of wonder.  These of course did not exist in regards to the Parlor's Margherita.  3. Without the crushing of the tomatoes, there was no sauce like vehicle to separate the crust and cheese, and I didn't really detect any Olive Oil in there like a white pizza has.  Beyond tomato-gate, the house Mozzarella is uneventful at best, and sprinkling Mozzarella on top of the tomatoes as well is just a waste. It falls right off due to the inherit moisture in the tomatoes and reminds me of something a slice shop would do when they reheat a slice in the oven.  This Margherita gave me some insight into the Parlor.  They are either, unwilling or totally oblivious to the fact that at the core, their pizza is rubbish and they're just throwing high grade toppings on it to cover that up.  One 700 ft drive up the street to Bianco in Town and Country would give them some serious education in how to kill a Margherita on every level.  I see it like this, either they're negligent or incompetent in regards to pizza.  I don't care if this place's "{Inset Name Here}" pizza is really good, because they're just shrouding amateurish pizza with clever toppings.  There are many other places around the city that have put some real time in to getting everything right with their pizza besides what they put on it.  If you're thinking about going here, do yourself a favor and move along down Camelback to 20th and hit up Bianco at Town and Country.

What can I say, I love music, I love beer and I love food.  This place has all of those things and more.  Music: They have an awesome sound system (I know cause I've played through it several times).  They have great bands come through, like What Laura Says, The Latest, The Sugar Thieves, Chuck Hall Band and Many more.  Beer: They stock a very decent tap.  Highlights would be Moose Drool, Pilsner Urquell  and Racer 5 IPA for me, but they have some good reggies like Blue Moon, Fat Tire, etc.  Food: The food is a quasi american/ mexican/ hipster thing.  I've had the Blue Burger which was tasty and the Green Chili and Cheese tamales, which I devoured in seconds flat.  I've seen some other seriously good looking stuff grace other peoples' lips as well.  Bottom Line: I like this place a lot.  It has a great feel to it, it's spacious, they have great bands, booze and food.  The only problem I can see with it is it's location... Mayo and Scottsdale?  I wish it were more centrally located.

I was snooping around NorSco looking for some sweet delectables with my girl friend when we stumbled upon this place off of Thompson Peak and Hayden. Apparently we were there on this location's first week anniversary.  The place had a moderate amount of heads in it and when I saw the tap, I was ready to go.  They have a pretty decent tap.  Some goodness from Avery, Breckenridge Brewery, Oberon, Ska Brewey, and many others.  The Double IPA I rocked was quite fantastic and they had some Belgium delights too.  After a talk with one of the employees, I came under the impression that they are looking to beef up there beer selection, and the dude was actually taking notes on some of my suggestions... I'm a sucker for a righteous tap and massive bottle selection of eclectic brews.  Enough about the beer onto the burgers... They have 5 burgers that they have ready crafted on their menu, some sammies and salads, but their wheel house is the build your own burger.    They offer American Kobe, Bison, AAA Angus, Salmon, Turkey Veggie and a sliders option.  You then add your cheese of choice, I went for Gorgonzola.  Next is the veggies, followed by specialty items... god I love green chile, then some sauces and finally your choice of bun.  The buns are made there and are very good. Did I mention it comes with fries, sweet potato fries or a salad?  I macked my burger with the quicks and then devoured my fries.  I was very satisfied with the food and the potent hoppy beer sealed the deal.  I stumbled out a happy customer.  This place might actually put the spank on Deluxe.  It has so many more options, Kobe and Bison being the sockdolinger.  Also, it's nice not having to get a shopping cart of fries for 6 bucks.  Bottom line: This place is great to gorge out on a high quality burger, then get mashed up on dank beer afterwords.  Me likey.

One word: Crab Cake.  I know this is a corporate type cookie cutter restaurant, but it is hard to deny the pimp that is Eddie V's.  First of all, they have live music and hire good musicians. I know, cause I've played here. A particularly great night to come is Sunday, as "The New Wrecking Crew" throws down some out jazzy noises, but everyone playing there is legit.  Second, everything I've eaten there is top notch.  Maine Lobster Tacos... oh yeah. Truffle mac and chac is banging. Steak carpaccio is killing it. I haven't even touched on an entree' yet.  They have a sushi bar too.  The one thing that pushed this joint over the edge for me is the crab cake. This is the most glorious crab cake you will get in AZ.  Crabby as hell with just enough other stuff to hold it together.  The crab is fresh and high grade.  Man it tastes so good, I'm about ready to go get one now.  Did I mention they have Duvel?  That's right if you're going to have a limited selection of beer, go for the gusto.  The service here is great and the management is incredibly nice... I don't think I've worked as a musician at a restaurant that has nicer management.  This place is expensive, but it's definitely well worth it.

When I noticed this place open up, I was quite curious; however, I never made it out to here until last night.    They were very polite and quick, but the cheesesteak was average at best.  Of course, on my first time there I went for the sandwich with the wiz on it, as to measure it up to others in the cheesesteakosphere.  It was the kind of experience that started out decent, but by the time I was about 5 bites in, the lower quality ingredients began to speak.  By the end I was over it and, the last bite tasted exactly like a McDonalds cheeseburger.  The bread was run of the mill and too soft, but didn't get totally soggy.  Honestly the fixings on the sandwich were the only thing speaking to me.  The meat wasn't like thin sliced steak, it was more like some chimera of steak and ground beef.    They have an OK tap there.  I see it as a reasonable option for late night/boozy acquisitions, but don't plan a meal on it.

This place is in line with all the other Bianco joints: legit.  Besides having arguably the best pizza in a 600 mile radius, the best fresh mozzarella in the valley, ultra fresh ingredients, and hop knot on tap, you can essentially walk into this place and get seated immediately any night.  I have never waited.  The service is always good at this location in my experience.  One thing about the pizza here.  It's an exercise in control and attention to detail.  The crust is always prefect, with some nice blistering and char. The mozzarella is lush and fresh.  The tomato sauce is simple and perfect.  By dialing in all the finest details, this place pumps out world class pies... I literally feeling like hugging the dude running oven duty every time I take my first bite.  This is my go to Bianco location.

I find this establishment's lack of quality disturbing.  I work down the street from this place and had been eyeing it for a while; however, a place in the same vicinity, Tacos Sahuaro, is so good, that I kept putting it off...  I wish that I had continued that behavior.  Looking at the pics and reviews, I expected this place to be moderately good.  I understand there is some margin on reviews depending on other's determination of what is quality and not; however, this goes beyond margin into Styrofoam tongues.  When I went here, I was a little dismayed by their choice of protein for their tacos.  Steak(carne asada) and chicken only.  This threw up (that is a pun in relation to what eating here might make you do) a red flag that I should've heeded.  Where's the carnitas, cabeza, lengua, al pastor, and other items you see at most taco shops... this is total gringo fodder.  The guy working the drive through window's customer service was not very pleasant... I almost felt like I was bothering him. The interior looked a little dirty from what I could see, but it's a taco shop so I overlooked it.  I ignored all these instincts  and ordered 2 tacos of each and a carne asada quesadilla.  I took them home and dived into the chicken taco first. It was ok... Kind of sesame oil/soy heavy, which made it taste more like an asian chicken salad than a taco.   I moved onto the carne asada and, the horror, the horror.  I took a few bites and was not impressed by the taste at all, so I looked down and I saw several under-cooked pieces.  Besides the improper food temp, the flavor was not desirable.   Not enough marinade or time, so all that came through was how low grade the beef was, which is what the marination and nice sear is supposed to combat.  The Quesadilla was a complete failure.  Same temperature issue with the carne asada, and the poor flavor mixing with the cheddar-jack sysco cheese forced out a childhood memory of eating a grade school cafeteria cheeseburger... Every bite brought me back to 3rd grade and the worst cheeseburger I have on memory.  I ended up throwing everything away as, if the carne asada was under-cooked, I was not going to test my luck even further on the chicken.  My two cents: If you are going to do 2 proteins only, nail them. Do not, under-cook them, under-season them, over-season them, or fail to make them shine in any other way, as there is no incentive to patronize the establishment.  I have a feeling most of these reviews were done the waking side of a near blackout/2am taco binge as this place is not worthy of 3 stars let alone 4.  You can literally get better carne asada or chicken at a *bertos place.
