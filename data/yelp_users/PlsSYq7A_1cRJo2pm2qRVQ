The Short: A downtown Chinese restaurant still holding onto archetypes linked to 'the good old days.'   The Pros: - Friendly and personable staff. - Food comes out fresh and hot. - Vintage decor.  The Cons: - One refill maximum on soda. - Staff members barely speak English. - A singular ingredient often overpowers flavor of food.  - Restaurant policies are designed for you to eat menu items the way they see fit or spend tons of $$$. ***EX: All items come only with white rice. You have to spend $1.50 for a small cup of friend rice. No substitutions.***  ______________________________________________________  The Story:  I haphazardly found China Village on my way to a concert at the Rhythm Room. I wanted something in my stomach before starting my night of music and debauchery. Before even checking my trusty Yelp app, the restaurant caught my attention with its folksy outside décor. Its exterior resemblance to Chicago's China district convinced me that it would, at the very least, have the basics of (American style) Chinese cuisine mastered. So, ignoring the old idiom, 'never judge a book by its cover,' I parked my car and walked into what ended up being an antiquated social environment.   First, I'd like detail the food. The menu is laid out in a similar manner to any local Chinese restaurant across America. I always wondered why these are so similar. Is there a database they buy them from? Does the Chinese government teach its citizens how to sell to Americans prior to getting their passports approved? Is it a subliminal demonstration of the Red Dragon's united might? More than likely, the answer is I just eat too much Chinese food.   China Village lost some points with me from the very start with their policies. First, sodas, which run $2 for a comically small cup, are limited to a single refill. This is often the highest profit item for restaurants and the owners plan to keep it that way with their authoritarian statute. Second, all items come with white rice. No substitutions. You can purchase a small cup of fried rice for $1.50, but you are still getting a large serving dish of white rice. God help you if you don't eat it all! The judgmental looks I got put me back in the mindset of a preschooler getting lectured about starving Ethiopians for not finishing dinner.   The dishes are presented in an alluring manner but lack any true substance. I ordered the house chicken, which on the menu boasted a plethora of ingredients. Expecting an orgasm, insert childish laughter here, of subtle and complex flavors; I was surprised when all I could taste was garlic. That's it. It didn't have a hint of poultry, nor a snifter of spice, or even a splash of citrus. Just garlic. On the bright side, I no longer stay awake at night in fear that the kid from Twilight will break through my bedroom window. Not because he played a vampire in a movie, but because all actors are soulless creatures that live off the blood of others and are repelled by garlic. It's just a scientific fact.   Lastly, I'd like to detail the atmosphere. The entire décor of the restaurant has been well taken care of but appears as if it hasn't been updated since the '80s. The staff, while genuinely courteous, followed too many stereotypes to not be deliberate. Every decision I made was met with a compliment pertaining to my ability or intelligence. No one spoke more than a few words of broken English and all the servers were women.   I'm just an old chunk of coal. I don't know how to tell authentic Chinese cuisine from that being altered for American tastes. I'm not privy of the social markers indicative to Chinese hospitality.   I do know when front is being put up. I'm understand that just because someone talks or acts a certain way doesn't mean they are creating traditional delicacy.   The reason for this front became alarmingly apparent while watching fellow patrons of China Village. The less English a hostess spoke the more they were tipped and the happier the customer appeared. It was an experience for them; especially those over 60.   The workers and owners of this establishment are merely responding to an economic incentive. People are awarding them for acting a certain way. Maybe this reminds them of 'the good old days' when an Asian American was only from China or Japan. There's a chance customers don't realize they are sending hegemonic messages. Overall, I don't think this is done with some malicious intent in mind, but it's not something I want to support.   The food here isn't really that tasty, and because I'm not into the pageantry being displayed, there is very little reason for me to come back.

Sorry to forgo my usual review style, but I wanted to give a warning for this location and Best Buy in general.   Consumer Warning:  Best Buy does not follow their own website's stated price matching policies. This location in particular is bad. Avoid them unless you simply enjoy the sheer thrill of paying more for something than your friends.

The Short: The best tasting wings in the PHX area hurt by erratic service and lack of culinary diversity.   Pros: - Wings, wings, and wings. - Lots of tasty sauce options. - Fries that 'bite back' (thanks Dayum). - Serves beer! - Open late. - Amazing boneless wings.  Cons: - Food quality and choices falls flat after wings and fries.  - Orders can take fooooooooreeeeevvvvveeeeerrrrrrr! - Dining area not always clean.  - For whatever reason, some of the workers hate you. Not me, you. Yes, you in the back.   Best Item(s): - Wings (any type) - Fries (even if you find them in the trashcan or on the floor)  Interesting Fact: The food here tastes just as good sober or drunk. I prefer drunk to help me deal with some of their workers.

The Short: Pizza so good that it graces God with its existence. I think they sell other stuff but I'm to busy worshipping the slice from my last visit to find out.   The Pro: - Everything. Just ... EVERYTHING (almost).  - You could tell me their food is made out of people. I'd still eat it.  The Con: - Some of their younger employees have bad attitudes and an allergic reaction to work.

The Short: A restaurant that boasts having 'The Valley's best BBQ' but only serves up an uninspired, 'meh.'  The Pros: - It tastes ...... alright. - The back room dining area is clean, comfy, and features three large-screen TVs.  - Orders are brought out pretty fast.  The Cons: - Brisket is as dry as the Phoenix desert.  - No real smoke flavor or spices. - Customer service is often dismal. - Sides don't complement main dishes.  - Majority of meats have a bland mass-produced flavor.   The Best Item(s):  - Coca-cola  - Interesting Fact: BBQs used to be the politician's venue of choice to speak with their constituents. Back in the day, talking with your senator was always accompanied with free food! (Source: BBQ: The History of an American Institution, Robert F. Moss)  _____________________________________________________________  The Story:  I consider myself a BBQ aficionado. I've feasted at several of America's most cherished BBQ Pits from coast to coast and roast to roast. Congress has passed legislation that requires BBQ festival patrons to address me as 'your majesty.' Cows and pigs are afraid to make eye contact with me!  So believe me when I tell you, I know the difference between a good and bad brisket.   Because of such, I take it serious when a restaurant claims to have the best BBQ of a particular locale. Unfortunately, more times than not, these claims are a mix of bravado and marketing. Pork on a Fork happens to be an quintessential example of this phenomenon.   I've been to this outer-beltway Deer Valley location twice and both times ultimately led to me feeling like Mick Jagger (cause I can't get not satisfaction).   The customer service was not just disengaged with the task at hand, but seemed to have no interest in the customer being there at all. I have tried their pork, brisket, and ribs. All three had the same mass-produced bland flavor that was more reminiscent of fast food than it was masterful BBQ. The brisket was the worst offender, possiblely due to the entire top fat cut off before smoking. The end result, regardless of the reason, was a BBQ sandwich that had the same succulence as a bucket of sand. There are bags of charcoal scattered throughout the restaurant, and I'm sure they're actually used, but a disconnect exists somewhere because it's almost impossible to make anything with such promising beginnings this insipid.  Pork on a Fork has great reviews overall. I find this mind boggling based on my experience but sometimes that's just how it goes. There's always the possibility they were having a bad day during my visits. Cooking is more of an art than a science.  If you're looking for some quick and easy BBQ, stop by. Otherwise it's probably best to go somewhere else.

The Short: Demeter has ascended from Mount Olympus and blessed Arizona with the ambrosia that is served at George's Famous Gyros and Pasta.   The Pros: - Quality ingredients that can be tasted in the end product. - Amazing bang for the buck. - Distinctive yet consistent menu that keeps overall theme in mind. - Friendly service surrounded in a family orientated atmosphere.  - Great specials. - Clean dining area.   The Cons: - Dining area extremely basic and dated (if that bothers you). - Delivery price restrictions.  - Closed on Sunday (if that bothers you as well). - Distant location for a majority of Phoenix.   Best Item(s): - Gyro platter or combo. - Spaghetti and meat sauce. - Any variety of salad.  _________________________________________________  The Story:   There are some restaurants that are an absolute pleasure to be a patron of. They act as the cornerstone that all others within their field are compared to. They are the master of their domain and the archetype for what a successful establishment should resemble. That can vary from the the atmosphere they provide to category of food they make. With that in mind, enter George's Famous Gyros and Pasta (George's).   I discovered George's immediately after graduating from college and moving to Phoenix to work and live. They were the last stop in my journey to find the best American-Greek restaurant near my neighborhood in northern Phoenix. I feel comfortable saying that, lucky for me, I found the best one in all of Arizona.  George's isn't worried to much about frills. Their food, while presented in an alluring manner, is served on your basic Styrofoam (another one of those surprisingly trademarked words) plate. The unassuming menu looks like it was designed and printed at the Kinko's located next-door. Heck, even their dining room looks like it belongs in a low budget '70s film.  This is easily overlooked and forgotten after the first bite. Everything at George's has been artfully constructed by someone who loves what they do. There is a difference between simply being talented at something and enjoying it as well. I never thought you could taste the difference until I ate at George's.   To avoid boring you, I will focus largely the restaurant's specialties, gyros and pasta.   The perfectly seasoned gyro meat is thinly cut from its rotisserie and always served fresh. I can't stress the importance of this. Several Greek restaurants in Phoenix subscribe to the belief that thickly cut Gyro meat provides the best flavor possible. I'm telling you folks, this isn't true! The thinner cuts come out crisper and allow the spices to take center stage on your tastebuds. This is essential to making a quality gyro. The subtle-sweet pita bread acts as the ideal delivery vehicle for the meat and veggies. It not only literally wraps it all together, but does so flavor wise as well. Fabulous.   George's serves the basic styles of spaghetti and a few unique ones. While I did enjoy their take on 'Greek pasta,' I am going to focus on the standard spaghetti and meat sauce. Right know, I know you're thinking, "how do you mess up something as simple as spaghetti?" I agree, it's a pretty easy dish to make, but it becomes much more complicated when you include meat sauce into the equation. Here, George's has decided to make it as thick and meaty as possible. I agree with this approach. The finely ground hamburger is almost impossible to siphon from the sauce's already hearty consistency. If you prefer your meat sauce to be more of a 'hamburger soup,' then this isn't for you, but I still recommend you give it a try.  Lastly, George's customer service is superb. This isn't to suggest the staff is perfect in this area, but they succeed at creating a humble and warm atmosphere that is usually only found in small towns. You feel like your are at a friend's house after a month of dining there once a week or so.   Ultimately, George's has mastered the essence of what American-Greek food should taste like at a local eatery. There are aspects of it that could improve. This place likely isn't for you if a restaurant's decor has a large affect on your experience. Pass it over and spend your hard earned dollar somewhere that will make you happy! If not, this is a stop you can't miss. Don't forget to call out my name! I'll likely be there myself.

The Short: Southern fried spicy chicken finds a home in the desert.   The Pros: - Quality ingredients. - Just the right level of spice. - Great variety of sides.  - Waffles! - You can't have waffles without warm syrup!   The Cons: - Lack of bargain meal deals. - Service appears disengaged at times.  Spice Level: The chicken's breading contains a subtlety warm paprika based flavor that hits its fiery peak during the aftertaste. Suitable for almost all spice affinities.   ____________________________________________  The Story:  I must admit, I have a soft spot for fried chicken. In a bucket resting on top my stomach (badum tish).   All joking aside, I have been a fan of Louisiana Fried Chicken (LFC) since discovering its now closed location in southern Phoenix years ago. So, like the buffalo herd moving onto greener pastures, the other LFC junkies and I must now venture to the Thomas Road location.   There are some advantages to this. While the new locale can be a bit of a drive for those scattered throughout the Phoenix area, it's an overall nicer venue. That being said, the interior doesn't standout that much from your average fast-food dining room. It's clean but uncomfortable seating is enough to get the job done. Much more than its now deceased Thomas Road brother.   What makes LFC stand out is the food. Everything is expertly crafted in unison. The sweetness of the waffles and syrup complement the spice of the fired chicken and the salty-sweet fries accent the simple flavors of the green beans. Wash it all down with a soda pop and your addicted.   The chicken's breading contains a subtlety warm paprika based flavor that hits its fiery peak during the aftertaste. Suitable for almost all spice affinities. In many ways, this is my favorite aspect of LFC. I often find myself at odds with friends over where to eat due to my love of spicy food. The smoothness of the ingredients in LFC's culinary ventures make this less of an issue.  This isn't a restaurant dedicated to forging an image that matches the connotations associated with the food it serves. It doesn't try to pander to any particular crowd. It's a simple restaurant with a simple goal and because of such can be off-putting to some.   My largest complaint is placed largely with the customer service staff. While adequate a majority of time, they rarely aim to surpass expectations. This continued annoyance is what led to the 4-star rating as apposed to a five.  Overall, it's a quality friend chicken shack in a town that has a tendency to lack this loved American pastime.   Check it out, write a review, and friend me on Yelp!!!
