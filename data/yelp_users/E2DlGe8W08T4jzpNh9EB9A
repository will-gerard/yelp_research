I use this Enterprise because it's really convenient to where I live.  Always fast, friendly service;  I've never had a issue with the staff or any of the vehicles I've rented.  Enterprise has a good loyalty program and being a Discover card member, you can sometimes get addt'l discounts and upgrades, which sweetens the deal even more.  Since I live close, I've hitched a ride home from the rental office on multiple occasions and as I stated before, the staff has been nothing but professional and pleasant to deal with.

I went to Moore to get my back bumper replaced and was very pleased with the service.  The initial quotes were explained to me and the pricing was fair.  The staff was friendly and courteous and the work was done as promised.  I went to Moore out of convenience and was apprehensive after reading the other reviews posted here but didn't experience any of the problems the other reviewers did.  This was not an insurance claim/repair, if that matters.  My car looks great and they cleaned and vacuumed the interior before pick up.  Based on this experience I would highly recommend them!

This is the closest bowling alley for me, but if you like to BOWL - unless you play with a league that bowls here, there are far better options elsewhere.  Their basic rate is $5+ per game per person;  they no longer do an hourly rate (they are 'Bowlmor' not AMF).  So, if you like to BOWL, unless you go on Sunday (after 6pm, $3 games) or Monday ($13+ for unlimited bowling after 8pm) the $5 per person per game will leave your wallet pretty thin for minimal lane action.  Luckily, I have my own shoes otherwise I hear they have $5 shoe rental as well.       I had visited this location back when it was truly an AMF and had a standard look to the lanes and seating area.  It's now been revamped to have lounge type booth seating and lots of screens for videos and such.  I get the feeling they're trying hard to compete with Lucky Strike as far as pricing (crazy expensive) and their lounge style aesthetic.  Which is fine for the Scottsdale crowd that wants to do novelty bowling, but again, if you want to BOWL, there are better options out there.  That being said, the staff is incredibly nice and that's what keeps me coming back.  I feel bad for the ladies working the counter now that it's Christmas, though.  Management is REQUIRING the ladies working the front counter and serving to wear these slutty Santa outfits;  fit for working at Fascinations maybe, but the bowling alley?  A red crushed velvet skin tight dress, cut low in front and short all around with white fuzzy trim.  Watching these poor girls try to be modest and clear tables while wearing these ridiculous outfits bothers me.  The male staff, on the other hand, has to wear Santa hats.  Um, hello, how is that fair?  The rest of the year they all wear t-shirts, polos or button up shirts and slacks.  I can understand encouraging your staff to be festive for the holidays, but don't require them to wear something that prevents them from doing their job comfortably, especially when as a patron, I find it inappropriate for the venue.

This post office is terrible.  Once your mail arrives at this station, who knows wtf happens to it?  THEY certainly don't.  I have emailed, and called repeatedly to no avail.  The line is continuously busy, all times of the day - ALL DAY, EVERYDAY.    My package arrived at the station on 4/15 and disappeared.  No one seems to care or have any customer service skills capable of calling or emailing me back.  I was able to get Henry Almanza (602-957-2693) on the phone ONCE (I didn't know at the time it was a freakin miracle, as I have never been able to get through to ANYONE since then).  He refreshed me on the tracking info "Well, it shows it arrived here on 4/15."  Yep.  I'm well aware of that part, hence the call...  He said he would call me back after he talked to the fellow that did my route.  He DID call me back to say he wasn't able to get a hold of him while he was on his route but he would keep me posted.  I never heard from him again.  I was given a case ID# and some other number that I have referenced with all my correspondence (4 addt'l emails), and the original tracking number.  I submitted another claim to the 'main' post office customer care email over a week ago, and have yet to receive a response from them either.    This isn't the first time I've had issues with this station.  I order regularly from online vendors and quite often the tracking info never gets updated once it reaches the Arcadia station.  I don't know how that's possible, but I've seen it happen multiple times.  It arrives there, then miraculously gets delivered without ever being scanned to show it's 'out for delivery' OR shows it's out for delivery and then still doesn't arrive at my home for another 1-2 days (if at all).    I probably wouldn't even have written a review, had they just given me the courtesy of keeping me informed, as Henry had promised.  Even if, ultimately, the package was lost for good, at least I would know, and could consider the issue resolved;  not to my liking, but over with.  At this point, I have chosen to reorder my "lost" items out of pure frustration and lack of any other recourse.  I don't understand how there can be no accountability for this station or my lost mail!!

I have been on a Greek salad kick lately and decided to not eat at Smashburger and give Pita Kitchen a whirl.  I was a little apprehensive spending $9 (8.69) on a Greek salad with chicken but told myself it would be huge and I would have to eat it over 2 sittings.  I was NOT disappointed.  There is a huge heap of chicken in this salad and it's not just a grilled chicken breast chopped over a Greek salad;  it's chicken SHAWARMA - beautifully seasoned, tender and moist.  There were chunks of feta as opposed to just tiny crumbles and their dressing was amazing!  My brother and I butt heads over Greek salad dressing;  he prefers to have it with vinegar strong enough to clean your pipes, and his go to is George's Gyros.  I prefer a more mellow dressing that allows me to keep my eyes open whilst eating and have come to frequent Z's Greek, down the road from my house.  This dressing was by far the BEST I've had.  I will definitely be back!
