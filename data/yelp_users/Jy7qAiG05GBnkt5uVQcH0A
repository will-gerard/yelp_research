We had attended the Fish Market last night, as a party of 10. The atmosphere is like any other seafood restaurant with a mixed crowd. We had planned on going for the Sushi happy hour, since it was the only restaurant that would hold a reservation for a large group. We were informed at the end of the visit that sushi happy hour is only in the bar, even though we had clearly stated we were there for it and ended up paying full price for sushi. That was the least of our problems.  We arrive for our reservation on time, and were seating promptly. Our waiter was kind and personable.   Service was horrendous and completely changed my attitude about the experience. We didn't receive much attention, drinks were left empty and we were left waiting for long periods of time, with no communication with the server. We didn't get our food ordered until an hour after being seated.   A few people at the table had ordered from the regular menu, while the rest of us ordered sushi. The regular food came out to the table and it was luke warm, bland, and nothing we had expected. The presentation was poor, and looked very unappetizing. The chicken was overcooked, served with bland rice and potatoes.   The normal food was delivered long before our sushi, which left half the party done while the rest of us were still waiting for our food. We waited a good hour to hour and a half for food. When the sushi arrived at the table it was warm, and not rolled very well.   We were misquoted on the price of drinks, which led to a discussion with management who were kind enough to adjust the bill.   After spending a total of 3 1/2 hours at the restaurant, we all concluded that we would never return. It wasn't worth the money, nor our time.

I work in the area and was looking for a new place to go for lunch. We found this restaurant and I was quite pleased! The sandwich was great! Very filling, and tasty! They play great music while in the restaurant and it is just a great atmosphere to be in!  Very friendly, layed back staff! I had the Chicken Salad sandwich and it was very yummy! Can't wait to go back and try something new off the menu (which I think is pretty extensive!)

This place is wonderful! I have gotten food for take out and it was always very good! We order it frequently as a group at the office where I work. They are always accommodating!   We went to the restaurant and had lunch and it was also very good! Service was great and quick. Would recommend this place to anyone!

The only reason this place got two stars was because I was able to swallow the food. Beyond that, don't get your hopes up!   There was a total of 5 of us in the party. The space is not very big, since we took up most of the seating available. I would recommend getting take out.   I ordered Sesame Chicken and my friend ordered Orange chicken. I think the only difference our food was that I had sesame seeds on top. The food was bland and not very flavorful. I also had egg drop soup, which was like drinking hot water. The pork fried rice was probably the best part of my meal.   The wait staff was friendly and kind. Quick on service. It was fair priced.
