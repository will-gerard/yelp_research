Like most places reviews on Yelp in Phoenix, this place is over rated. Okay, it's cheap. Which is great if you just want to eat, but it's nothing special. Found it pretty boring and plain. The interior resembled a jail cell and felt dirty. Won't be heading back anytime soon.

WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER. Absolutely disgusting to find half of my burrito was filled with balls of fat. You'd think they'd take that off the bill? Not a chance. Other than that, it wasn't even tasty. Server was nice.

No visit to the dentist is fun, but these guys were great. Very helpful, honest and down to earth. Didn't try to rip me off either. All in all it was a pleasant experience.

Bad haircut from the lady. First time i've ever had a haircut that is long but also short at the same time. I'm confused by my haircut.

Why are people lining up to get in here? It's really not all that. Seriously, just go to Denny's.

You've gotta be fucking kidding me?! Who's been reviewing this place? Weird, weird, weird. Our waitress (Gollum) who I found with her fingers in her mouth had less charisma than the dirty cutlery on our table. It's hard to enjoy food once you've seen that but the place was also completely empty, void of an atmosphere and the food which was served on some sort of jailhouse metal food tray was of a piss poor standard. I found a hair on my plate too which I can only assume came from Gollums beard.  If I could give this place no stars I would. The only redeeming feature was the parking space right in front of the exit which will help when you want to get the hell home to take a bath. Don't eat here unless you truly hate yourself.

I don't wanna play games when I'm drinkin' but if you're into that, you'll love this place. Decent beers, nice staff.

Where else can you eat great Thai food and listen to The Smiths & New Order? It's seriously good.
