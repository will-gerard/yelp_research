First time, and I was really looking forward eating here. We sat on the patio. Service was extremely slow, appetizers were not even warm. We waited over 30 min for our entrees, and they were not warm at all, but aour server, Adriana was never available to make it right. Will not go back!

This place is amazing!  The girls found that Wednesdays are just plain wonderful, with their food and wine deals... Delicious pizza and the half price bottles of wine can't be beat... Can't wait to go back.  The owners are friendly, welcoming and inviting.

Met my 2 girlfriends here for dinner last night. It was my first time there.. They frequent it often. They raved about the food. Service was fine. We had veggie egg rolls as an app. I ordered the coconut chicken hot pot soup. It was a good flavor. Friends both got the same thing. I think a # 25, which they get often.  Mid dinner I noticed something moving between us and it was a HUGE ROACH on the back of the booth. Scared the hell out of all of us. We all screamed and jumped out of the booth, making a scene. Everyone in the place was staring at us and the owner was sitting towards the back of the restaurant eating. She asked what was wrong and we said there was a huge Roach on our booth. She remained seated and said, oh that's because it's so hot outside. They like to come in! That was it! No apologies, nothing! She didn't even get up from the table and kept eating. Needless to say, we were done eating and just wanted to leave. They didn't offer to comp our meal/meals, give an apology or anything. They just plain didn't give a crap! I will never go back and will be calling the health department next! Don't go to this Roach infested place!
