First of all, their gluten free pasta is really good! It's yellow and made from corn. It's nearly unheard of to see an Italian restaurant (non-chain, chain, authentic or not) have a gluten free option. +1, seriously.  I've always liked the Spaghetti Factory. It's not the best but it is dirt cheap and they have so many cool decorations. I'm a sucker for old antique-y looking stuff.   The service can be slow and it's always busy, but hell...ALL Spaghetti Factories are this busy if not more. It's not an anomaly people. I'm just happy they have a call-ahead system so you don't have to wait for hours when you arrive.

Oh my gosh, heaven!!   Walking inside of the place I wasn't expecting to see such a monstrosity of a restaurant. It's just huge. There's a large panaderia right when you walk in where you can order tasty Mexican pastries. You walk down a little ways and order your meal at the counter. There's a salsa bar to the right with all sorts of great salsas from spicy to mild, to avocado, etc.   I ordered the Super Nachos and they were so good! I didn't want to stop eating them and literally gorged myself until I couldn't lift another chip into my mouth.

This place has a great little vibe and fantastic music. I have to admit, I'm not very hip when it comes to the Blues but I definitely enjoy listening to it when given the chance. It was a nice change to look into the crowd and see 21-year-old college students, to middle age moms, to retired couples all getting down and dancing. You rarely see such an eclectic mix of people, from every color of the rainbow, and all ages, just enjoying the music. The few times I've been there have been quite an experience, and I always leave very happy to have found a place like this in Phoenix.   The drinks are super cheap, the sound is good, and the music is wonderful!

Normally I would never pick to eat at the Cheesecake Factory, ever, but a co-worker picked it for a work function, so off we went.   There were about 10 of us in our group, and before we ordered we apologized to our waitress for needing separate checks. I think 7 checks in all. They seemed cool with it...at first.   I have to preface by saying, the worst service I've ever received has been at the Cheesecake Factory. Out of the four times I've been, every single time has been horrendous. The very first time I went (this was a different location)  one of my dining partners didn't get their meal for 20 minutes after ours. We were completely through with our meals but the server never offered to comp her meal. In fact, he was never seen after taking our order. We had to flag down a manager to take care of the issue.   The other few times I've had the slowest, rudest service of my life. This time was no different. The server acted thoroughly annoyed by our group, was short with us, refused to smile AT ALL, and generally was a complete wench. Splitting the tab was clearly WAY too much work for her, as it took 20 minutes for her to figure out who ordered what (even though we asked if it was ok to split tabs long before we ordered) but actually running the tabs? Wow, add on another 10 minutes! We apologized again for having to split tabs, hoping maybe that would make her less huffy, but she never acknowledged that we were trying to be nice, and instead just went around acting huffy and like we were thorns in her side.   Well, obviously she could be a total b*tch because gratuity was already included. 18% on the tab, which I understand with large groups. However, I felt she was acting as bitchy as she wanted to because in the end, she'd be getting a good tip regardless.   As for the food, it's a big whatever. Anything other than lunch is overpriced. In the end it's just overpriced ridiculously sized chain food . I don't understand why people love it so much. I hope for the rest of my life I never step foot in one again. I know I won't be missing much.

A little back story, I've been on the hunt for the perfect glasses for the past year. No joke. I was having the hardest time parting with my previous glasses, that I had nearly five years. Their bright blue color garnered me many compliments over the years, and I just couldn't fathom retiring them. I actually got those frames at a local chain, which came as a surprise since most of the national boring chains rarely carry anything funky.   I went back to said chain, to find more glasses, and found a suitable pair but realized soon after I purchased them, they weren't cute enough. So, given their 100% no questions asked return policy, I returned them. You would have thought I asked for a million bucks, because they were more than snobby and annoyed with my return. I vowed never to step foot in that place ever again.   I tried shopping other chains, basically going into every single place with no luck. I quickly realized my search was going nowhere and gave up. Then around Christmas I went to a Christmas party where I saw a girl in virtually the same blue frames as myself. I immediately asked her the brand name which was Etnia, and I felt like I won the lottery. She indicated they were Italian frames and purchased at a boutique shop in L.A. I immediately knew I'd find what I wanted with that info.   Googling "Etnia" in Phoenix gave me one result- Sassy Glasses. Off I went, immediately the same day, half way across the valley 35 miles to this little store. Right when I looked at their frame selection I was in heaven. It was like hitting a gold mine of glasses, I couldn't believe there could be so many stylish, colorful, unique glasses in one little store.   The owner immediately asked if I needed help, brought me over frames he thought would look good on my face (he was right on), informed me of their sale drawers of closeout frames, and was just generally extremely friendly and knowledgeable.   The frames are pricey. I found two frames I fell in love with. One was $390 and the other was $475. LOL! I always seem to pick the most expensive frames, so I continued looking. Sure enough, I lucked out and found a beautiful dark purple/blue frames for $200. Not only that, if I bought the lenses through them, they'd take off $100 from the frames making the frames only $100!   I told the owners that I was looking to get my lenses at Costco to save money. They were nice enough to call Costco for me and see what their prices were. It turned out they were only nominally cheaper given the great discount I got on the frames if I purchased the full set with Sassy Glasses. Plus, they informed me that while Costco is great, they don't use the newest technology for making lenses. Needless to say, I bought the whole pair through Sassy Glasses.   When it was all said and done, I paid $305 for both frames and lenses, which I may add was $50 cheaper than the chain store I went to the last time, and that was for practically no-name frames.   SO HAPPY I WENT HERE! Yelp is awesome!!!

This place had the most AMAZING meatloaf, fried chicken, and mac & cheese. I also ordered a side of greens which were good but a little too salty for me.   I don't order meatloaf at restaurants mainly because I know it'll probably be dry or have no flavor, but I had this feeling that Bobby C's would make it perfectly. I wasn't disappointed. It had this slight crunchiness on the outside that was like little heavenly crunchy bits.   The fried chicken beat the pants off of any other soul food restaurant I've been to. It was so juicy and to die for. The mac and cheese was another hit. Next time I'm going to order the mashed potatoes and gravy as well!   The staff was really friendly and the atmosphere was loungy with great old school tunes being played on their nice sound system.

When I was in college I took an internship with a prominent stained glass artist in L.A. For a semester I worked on my piece in tandem with him and was pretty thrilled with what I came up with. Shortly after finishing the piece I stored it in my dorm room, where I accidentally knocked it over and cracked it in three spots. I was devastated. The entire ten years it's been sitting in my storage room, broken, and unfixed.   I wasn't even aware that stained glass could easily be repaired, or that it would even be in my budget to fix it. Finally about a month ago I said "F* it! I'm getting this thing fixed!" I'm in the process of moving out of state and figured I didn't want to transport my broken piece one more time. It was depressing.  I googled around and found Tumbleweed Stained Glass in Mesa, very close to my house. I called and told them my situation, they said it was no problem and to take it in for a quote. Fred, the owner, is SUPER nice and told me it'd be no problem to fix my piece. He quoted me a very reasonable $120 to pull it out of the frame (which I only assume is a pain in the ass), replace the glass that was broken, put the frame back on and put screws on the frame so it can be easily hung. I thought that was a killer deal, as I was wiling to pay hundreds to repair it.  I'm very glad this place exists, and am even happier that I have this piece to hang again!

When I first moved back to the East Valley after a long stint in California the first thing I asked was, WHERE IS THE SUSHI? I needed a fix and fast. I figured my sushi eating days were over when I left the Golden State.   On a recommendation from a friend of a friend who's lived in the area for a long time, we ended up at Sekai Sushi. I had my doubts. I thought there was no way an excellent sushi bar could be in a strip mall in the heart of Mesa but I was seriously impressed from the minute I walked in. The chefs are always super nice, the servers are attentive, and the fish and rolls are fantastic. Everything is very fresh.

I started shopping exclusively at Trader Joe's years ago. Well, almost exclusively. If I didn't need a wider selection of produce I'd only shop there. I enjoy that their food has higher quality ingredients than the regular grocery store. I like looking at the back of a package and not seeing 35 ingredients with names I can't pronounce. I also dig the fact they don't use preservatives and that they have dried fruit without sulfites. Their food tastes better, there's not a whole lot of added crap, and everything is fresher.   Some food is seasonal, like those specialty shrimp they sell around summertime, which are fantastic! Everything about it makes me happy. I'm in and out in no time and the people working are always friendly and give me good advice on new food.

Hamburgers, sandwiches, breakfast food, pie, how could you go wrong? I admit their burgers aren't the best I've had but  they are good and I'd get them again. I do have to admit that I lived in southern California for a long time, where burger spots like this were ALL over the place, and many of them were very good so it's probably an unfair comparison.   What I especially love are their breakfasts. You can get breakfast for so cheap it's ridiculous, between $5-$9 to stuff yourself silly and everything tastes very good. The employees are so friendly. Service is quick, it's seat yourself and order at the counter. I'm really glad this place exists.

Organ Stop is like a trip down memory lane. Our family used to go a very looooong time ago, in the early 80's, when they were located in far West Mesa.   As a child I  can remember this giant organ bursting out of the ground like magic. As it towered over the audience, complete with lights and sounds I was mesmerized by its beauty. It's a childhood memory that is seared into my brain. I'm sure many of the children that go will find it truly magical.   The food is not what you go for, it is the entertainment and novelty of seeing this incredible organ being played, and the experience of enjoying something that you won't find many other places.   *****PLEASE NOTE****** They DO NOT accept credit cards!!! Cash or check only.  There is an ATM on site if you forget this.

This place is a standard salad bar, similar to Sweet Tomatoes if you can compare it to that. I ate here one evening because at the time there were no Sweet Tomatoes in Mesa or Gilbert and I was really needing my salad fix!  First thing I noticed was how filthy the salad bar was. It was seriously a mess...goopy salad dressing smeared all over, lettuce everywhere, vegetables that looked like they hadn't been wiped off the counter for hours. It was just gross to see that type of a mess in a buffet line.   The place was packed for a weeknight so I figured it was going to taste pretty good, or as good as salad buffet can be. The selection was mediocre at best, without too many options for salad toppings, and worst of all- the lettuce had seen its share of better days. It was wilted and browned. Plus if I remember correctly, there was an overabundance of iceberg lettuce and virtually no romaine and no spinach.   The soup was equally as disappointing. One of the soups was so salty it almost seemed like it was a mistake, like they accidentally doubled the sodium in the recipe. Ugh. I tried the other soups thinking they'd be better but all of them tasted like they came from a mix, or something out of a can. There was no distinct flavor to anything. I left thinking, is this it? Even so, I returned a second time to see if maybe it was just an off-day, plus I needed another salad fix. Well, same story, different day- dirty restaurant, and questionable food.

This place is truly a gem of the east valley. First of all, it's cheaper than cheap. Secondly, and most importantly, they have the most amazing selection of LOCALLY grown produce! Oh my god, it makes me so happy I'm probably going to cry.   I asked the owners how they keep their prices so reasonable and they said it's because they work with farmers that don't sell at the local farmer's markets, but want to sell their produce nonetheless. What they can't get locally (due to season or unavailability) they have from other states. They also carry home-made tortillas, kettle corn, honey, and salsas- all local!   I absolutely love this place. If you can't get to the Farmer's Markets or live too far (like me) you have to check this place out!

Over the summer months, this stand-alone farmer's market doesn't carry as much locally grown produce, especially at the end of the summer like July-Sept. Nearly everything they carry is from elsewhere due to the high heat of AZ I'm sure. That's fine with me but unfortunately that means veggies and fruit from other parts of the country that aren't as fresh.   I've gotten some bad produce but the good part is I can just take it back and get a refund. I do think though that next summer during this time I'll be going to one of the various weekly farmer's markets or just to Sprouts for produce. Every other time I'll still be here. :)

This place a little dive breakfast spot with a golf nick knack theme. There's golf stuff everywhere, golf clubs on the walls, golf clubs and tees as light fixtures, golf pictures. It's definitely a dive but they serve a pretty darn good breakfast.   Not to mention, it is SO CHEAP!  There's nothing over $6 on the menu. I got 4 slices of french toast, 2 eggs, hash browns, and sausage for $5.50. I mean, $5.50?!?!?!?! You can't even go to McDonalds and get some crappy breakfast for $5.50! Not to mention, the food is good.   There's usually a wait on the weekends, especially in the winter months because it's a winter-visitor haven. On any given weekend you generally can count about 30 smiley blue hairs.   It's tucked away behind an old-time Western strip mall and can be hard to find, as you can't see it from Apache Trail. But if you can find The Good Apple Natural food store, it's right next door. If you're ever out east during breakfast time, it's definitely worth checking out.

I've spent many days hiking the trails of this state park, all of them in fact, and have found wonder in amazement in all of them. There are amazing views on all of the trails and the hardest trail, Siphon Draw is not all that difficult if you can take a steady incline and climbing over a few boulders towards the end.   It's a great place to hike with pets, although I wish everyone would leash their dogs, mainly so other dogs (namely mine) don't start getting crazy excited when they see another dog running towards them.   It can get crowded during the cooler months, especially on weekends. I've found the best times to go are on weekdays, early to late morning, in the less hot times of year. There's very few people on the trails and if you take a less traveled trail, like one of the easier ones, you're very likely to not see another person on your hike. If you can find an early summer morning after a monsoon when the temperature is in the 70's, you'll find virtually no one on your hike as well. Plus it's a nice temporary escape from the heat.   The park is $5 per car or $2 if you walk or bike in. If you come often, you can buy a year-pass for about $65 (I think?). It's good for all the state parks, including Katchner Caverns and the Boyce Thompson Arboretum (The arboretum can get VERY pricey per person. One year we had 4 people go and we were all covered under the pass. It paid for itself just that one time!) I recommend the pass if you plan on going to any of the state parks at least a few times during the year. It'll pay for itself.

Oh so good, so so good. I've been looking for good Thai food ever since traveling through Thailand last year. This place really hit the mark.  The Laarb was fantastic and quite spicy, just the way it should be. It was presented really beautifully with cabbage leaves and sprigs of mint leaves. I ordered the Red Curry with mixed vegetables and shrimp. Yum. Shrimp were cooked perfectly and the curry was delicious.  Mangoes and sticky rice for dessert too. I can't wait to go back.

For all-you-can-eat sushi I'm not expecting the world. After all it is only $18.95 and that's a great deal. However there's only one thing I ask from any sushi establishment and that is for the fish to taste good. And I'm sorry but the fish was not great, or good, it was rather mediocre to sub par. I'm really surprised to see all 5 star reviews because it was not good. I love fish, I effing love it. If I could marry it I would. I'd make sweet love to it every night, seriously. ;-) This is not the best fish in the valley, not even close. I wouldn't even give it a second date.   The spicy tuna roll tasted off. The albacore tuna had a very weird consistency. There was a grittiness to the fish I've never experienced before. The sunset roll I thought was great though.   The service was good. Our waitress was very nice and prompt. However it took 20 minutes to get each order of fish. I don't totally blame them, it was busy with people watching baseball but still, there was only one chef for an entire restaurant on game night.   Overall, I don't even think it's worth the $18.95 for all-you-can-eat. I'd rather pay a little extra and get less at a great sushi restaurant.

This was definitely one of the better breakfast spots I've been to in Arizona. The decor was like country sheik and the wait staff was very friendly and attentive.  Both times I've ordered the veggie omelet and was happy to see they used fresh spinach and other fresh vegetables. It was very tasty. Most importantly (for me) nothing was super greasy.   The wait time to be seated can be a bit much if you're totally starving. I'd go back on a very early weekend morning or a weekday to avoid the masses.

REI has a fantastic selection of everything under the sun for you outdoor needs. Their prices are higher than big box chains but what I like about REI is the fact that their staff is extremely knowledgeable. I'm willing to pay a little extra to know I'm getting the right product and service to go along with it.  When I backpacked through Thailand last year, there was no other place I'd think of going besides REI for my backpack and gear. One of the staff members guided my fiancee and I through the process of choosing a backpack and fitting us. Had I chosen to go to another store, I know for a fact the staff wouldn't have a clue as to how to fit me properly or been able to teach me how to adjust the complex straps so it would sit properly on the body.   Their return policy is 100% no questions asked, at any time, and I enjoy their co-op program you can sign up for. Basically you pay a one-time nominal fee and each time you purchase items, a certain percentage comes back to you at the end of the year in the form of a dividends check. Sounds good to me!   Since you have to fill out personal information to join this program, I inquired if they sold my information to any 3rd parties and the insisted they do not. Well, this is the reason they don't get 5 stars. To be quite honest I was peeved because a month after signing up, I received the first of about 4 different outdoor catalogues all addressed to me. I had never purchased from any of these retailers so I was puzzled as to why I was receiving them.   After calling the various 800 numbers on the back of each catalog to get myself off their lists, I asked them how I got on their lists. Each company informed me they got my information from REI. BOOOO!  My fiancee called their corporate office to complain but they gave a basically B.S. response that tiptoed around the fact that they DO in fact sell your personal information to 3rd parties. Had I known that I would have given an incorrect mailing address.  I do still continue to shop here though and recommend it to anyone wanting great service.

I especially enjoy the dogs extra grilled so they're nice and blackened. Their french fries dipped in that cheese sauce are also a guilty pleasure. I love the place, although I haven't been in awhile I used to often. I've enjoyed the footlong and regular dogs, although the jumbo all-beef dogs are thicker and don't lend themselves to having the right consistency when charred. I'll take my non-all-beef hot dog complete with hooves and other weird animal parts, I'm sure, thanks. :)

It's nice to have a yoga studio in Gilbert, really nice. There seems to be an abundance of studios in Phoenix, Tempe, even Chandler but Gilbert definitely lacks in that department.   I started going to Gilbert Yoga after I took a job that no longer allowed me to go my regular studio in Tempe. I live in Gilbert so at first, Gilbert Yoga was more of a convenience than anything. Honestly, I've been thrilled with every teacher taken and specifically Ingrid and Robin. Now, it's not just convenience, I love everything about the studio.   I really enjoy taking yoga classes with a mix of people and it makes me happy to see a studio that caters to all levels, all ages, and doesn't turn anybody off. I've seen more 55+ yoga enthusiasts here than any other studio and it puts a huge smile on my face.   The studio has expanded. I took a class years ago and at that time the studio was only one room. They now have two rooms and a cute little entry way. It must mean they're doing something right! I love the studio, it's a breath of fresh air in an otherwise muted suburban landscape.

First, Lo-Lo's only gets 4 stars becuase L.A. is home to the famous Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, which is the BEST chicken and waffles. I ate like every week for a good 3 years. Oh and I met Jesse Jackson there lol.   Back to Lo-Lo's- the food was excellent. If you've never tried soul food, you're missing out, and should definitely treat yourself to the early heart attack because it's worth it. Just about nothing beats the juicy fried chicken breast smothered in gravy with a waffle on the side dripping in sweet syrup. Seriously, it's heaven for your mouth.   Highlights:  Sweet tea - Sweet as in it tastes like there's 5,000 packs of sugar in there and will send you into a diabetic coma. Hell yeah!  Greens- I love greens. These greens taste like they're made with bacon. Again, hell yeah!   Potatoes and gravy- The gravy could be a little thicker but I still love it.  The only thing I didn't like too much was the mac and cheese.   The service was fantastic, everyone was kind, prompt, and attentive. You can be waiting quite a while for a table, especially on Sunday mornings when people are coming back from church. Get there right when they open and don't worry about suffering from heat stroke in the summer. Or just wait in your car with the AC blasting until your name gets called.

Native New Yorker has never disappointed however the only thing I've ever eaten there are the wings, oh and the fries. I proceed to slather everything in ranch and enjoy the mess I've created. I think the hot wings are great, although the mild is pretty unappetizing and flavorless but who goes for hot wings and gets mild...well besides kids? :)  The mild wings are made with wheat flour, so anyone with gluten allergies beware. However, all the other wings- medium through death (or whatever fun name they give it) aren't. I like it, it's cheap, fast and yummy.

The food is pretty standard Americanized Italian fare but tasty nonetheless. They have very reasonable lunch specials during the week and kids eat free on Wednesday's!  I've been here many times, mainly with large groups of people and have never been disappointed. The service is excellent. They pay attention to the details of finer dining establishments and have service that's comparable.   The menu is on the heavy side and if I were basing it just on the menu I'd give it 3 stars. The only option for light fare are the salads. It's the only thing that won't make you feel like you just ate a half pound of butter and cheese.   The layout of the restaurant is very interesting as it used to be an old First Interstate Bank (remember those?!) The numerous winding hallways make it obvious that it wasn't designed as a restaurant. It definitely adds to the charm of the place, but you're for sure to get lost on the way to the bathroom the first time you're there.   They also have a large banquet room which used to be the Bank's safe. The very thick interior walls are exposed so as not to mask the fact that you're eating in the safe! That's very cool.

I absolutely love this place! The fact it's only a couple miles from my house is an added bonus.   It's authentic northeastern Thai food. It's very good. I've backpacked through the region and know the cuisine, obviously not as much as someone who's lived there for years as an ex-pat, or a resident, but I feel I got a grasp of the cuisine in the month I lived there.   This place is phenomenal. It's the best Thai food I've had in the valley. Obviously it's not your typical Thai food restaurant, due to it being NE Thai, but don't let that turn you away. Don't let any of the bad reviews turn you away, I've been blown away by the food.   Their salads are all phenomenal. There is one with lettuce, glass noodles, bean sprouts, pork, and shrimp (forgot the name!) and that's my favorite. If you're not into spicy, order at a 1 or 2 spicy and they'll bring out the chili spice for you to put on yourself. I've ordered it a 3 spicy and it's almost too much for me to handle, and I LOVE spicy food and especially Thai spicy. They serve a pitcher of water at every table. Their larb salad is also to-die-for.   They serve traditional Thai soups like shrimp and rice, chicken and rice..etc. They're so good and a meal in and of themselves.

This is a small family owned sub shop that's been in the same plaza in this older part of Mesa for over 30 years. This is the original but they've since expanded all over Mesa. You'll find them tucked next to the Dirty Drummer bar on the corner in the same plaza as Wendy's. It can be hard to spot if you're not looking for it.   They have brightly colored booth seating right when you enter. A few feet back is the counter to order. Depending on what time of day, you'll either see the owner working, his family, or your typical high school kids.  I've always enjoyed their subs, whether it was as a young child or on lunch break long ago in high school. What I enjoy most is their meat selection and the fact that they have a generous helping of not too tart italian dressing and mayo on their subs. The combination is hard to describe but when it's done right, it tastes unlike any other sub.Their bread is soft and fluffy and they leave out the million and a half vegetables you'll get at other places, making it a true sandwich- not just a bunch of vegetables on bread. You can get your sandwich hot or cold and they have reasonably priced lunch specials btwn. 10 AM - 2 PM where you can get an 8 or 12 inch sub, drink, chips or pickle for between $4.63 - $5.23  They also do catering.  Personally I think the Poorboy is one of the best with Salami, Spiced Ham, Bologna, & Provolone Cheese. I would never think of putting those meats together, let alone eat them by themselves, but for some reason they make it work. I love Krazy Sub :)

I think I've exhausted every possible thing you can do at Inside the Bungalow- drink coffee, do yoga, go on a retreat, & have a wedding! I guess I'm well versed in what they have to offer! ;)  A couple of years ago I was searching out for a place to have my wedding. I had gone to Inside the Bungalow to drink coffee and enjoy their fabulous outside seating but never knew they did weddings. One Saturday I stumbled in early in the morning and saw them setting up for a wedding in the back. I knew immediately that I was having my wedding here.   I can't say enough good things about the owners, Carrie and her mother. From the minute I expressed interest in having a wedding, they were nothing but generous, thoughtful, and helpful from start to finish. They were so accommodating and easy going, it felt like I was planning a wedding with a best friend instead of a business owner I hardly knew. It made the process seamless and pretty much stress-free from start to finish.   In terms of their coffee and yoga, fantastic! Since I moved to the downtown Mesa area it's become my regular place to stop in, have a drink, and take a yoga class.

El Charro has been in Mesa  f-o-r-e-v-e-r. The other reviewer was correct in that it used to be super smoky, but not anymore. Since the place is small, every table was a smoking table. My chain-smoking parents loved that back in the day...ha.   The food is wonderful. The inside is dark, old school, and it's like stepping back in time with the sticky vinyl booths and 70's table tops. They did paint it a dark green on the inside many years back, which was a nice change from the dark red it used to be. It used to be like stepping into a horror flick.   My parents have been going here since the 1970's. We practically ate there every week when I was a child. I missed it dearly when I moved out of state. Don't know if El Charro is necessarily authentic but that doesn't matter to me.   The soft tacos are my personal favorite. The chips are usually always hot. They have two salsas, a hotter one in a squeeze bottle and a milder one in a bowl, both very good. The prices are reasonable, the staff is nice, and your food comes out very quickly. :)

So what do I love about this bar? Oh let me count the ways...First, it's kind of seedy. And by kind of seedy, I mean seedy. Secondly, it's a mile from my house, and 3rd, it's excellent people watching. Oh, they also have very cheap drinks and if smoking is your thing, the entire place is still smoking because the place is screened in and technically "outside" even though it's not.   It's an interesting bar to say the least. It's in downtown Mesa. Ever been to downtown Mesa? This is a great place to get an understanding of the area.There are generally more bikes parked out front than cars. I like to refer to these cyclists as "10-speed-tweekers," but that is very ALLEGEDLY! :)  In any case, it's a great bar to have a drink for cheap, have a smoke, and people watch.

This restaurant came highly recommended so I was eager to check it out. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment.   First, the portion sizes are incredibly large, which you'd think would be great. However, they're SO large that it begs the question of how on earth they're able to afford to give out these portions for a relatively cheap price? We're talking fresh, raw fish, not American-style buffet. Bigger is not always better, especially when it comes to sushi.   The albacore was pretty tasty, I'll give it that. However, the rice was hot in the sushi and rolls!  Hot rice is disgusting!!!!!! So, so, SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO gross and a huge turn off!!! It warms the fish to the point of it not tasting right. Also if you don't eat the rolls immediately, the entire thing changes its consistency because the hot rice is melding with the cold fish and other vegetables. There is nothing more disappointing and disgusting than unknowingly biting into a warmed piece of sushi with hot rice.   They also only had 2 sushi chefs in the very packed restaurant. The rolls came out sloppier than I'd make at home. The rice to fish ratio was totally off. There was so much fish in the rolls and so little rice you couldn't even fit the whole thing in your mouth. The rolls were literally falling apart from the moment the chef cut into them, mainly from the lack of tightness when being rolled. It looked like a total mess.  Sushi is just as much about the beautiful presentation and the flavor of the rice, as it is about the taste of the fish. Unfortunately this place had mediocre fish and horrible presentation...and hot rice, which tells me they're not willing to take the time (or care about their customers enough) to present fish properly.

I was walking in Old Town, waiting for my hair appointment later in the afternoon. I was looking for the Mandala Tea Room but found the Picnic Company first. There were about 10 police motorcycles out front and I figured they knew what was up food wise in the area.   I felt rushed from the second I walked in the door. The employees looked like they were in a hurry and I felt pressured to order fast. I quickly glanced at the menu, not wanting to get a sandwich, I decided on the Sedona Salad for $6.50.   The salad was slapped down on the pick-up counter, and when I got up there, it was the most unappealing, thrown together mess I've ever seen at any establishment that calls itself a restaurant. First, it was extremely small. Second, the spinach, feta, nuts, and red onions were all just thrown on there as though it went through some fast food assembly line.The vinaigrette tasted bottled. I could have made a more presentable salad that tasted better with produce from Fry's, that cost me less than a dollar.   Who knows how their sandwiches are. I'm sure they're decent considering all the cops in there. I won't be back to find out.   I was so hungry after eating this sorry excuse for a salad, I walked over to the Mandala Tea Room and ate another meal. ugh.

This place has been recommended to me by family and friends so many times. As an Arizona native, I'm ashamed that I hadn't been here sooner. It took a friend coming into town to get me to go and I'm so glad I did.  The fact that they have Family Circus cartoons everywhere really made me smile. I wasn't aware that Bil Keane had so many cartoons centered around the Sugar Bowl. I absolutely love that old time pink and white decor too. It's as if time has stood still and with so much being renovated in the area, it's great to be reminded of a time in Arizona that's long gone.   I got a rootbear float which was fantastic. The ice cream was plenty and the way it melted in the float made it super thick and luscious. They have an old school ski-ball machine that's bright pink and reminicent of sometime between 1980-1989. :)  I found out their orange sherbet has dairy in it but the raspberry sorbet does not, just in case there's anyone out there with the sad misfortune of not being able to eat dairy at an ice cream parlor.

Vidal Sassoon has given me the best haircuts of my life!   I've tried to find comparable stylists and they just don't exist. Unless I can find someone trained from Vidal Sassoon working at a different salon, I'll always be disappointed.   I started getting my hair cut at the Vidal Sassoon Academy in Santa Monica, CA (where they teach stylists how to cut and color). That in and of itself made me a firm believer in the magic they can create. Every time I'd leave the salon I'd get numerous comments on how good my hair looked. I always felt like a million bucks.   When I moved to Arizona I tired a couple of well-known salons before settling back with Vidal Sassoon. No other salon compares. It's well worth the money for the cut, and trust me, forking over $80 just for a cut and tip doesn't come easily to me! It took a lot of disappointment with other stylists to come to the conclusion that they're worth the money.   After going to the Academy for years (and paying next to nothing) for cuts and colors, I listened to the instructors teach students how to cut. First, the actual way the hair is cut is different than other schools; this is the main reason why their cuts are FAR superior in my opinion. You can tell by the way your hair feels and moves when you leave the salon. This may sound silly but it feels like it's a part of your body and not just an extension of it. That's the best way I can describe it.   In fact, I've found their cuts look better the less styling you do to them.  Plus, they're long lasting, and don't require you to come back every 2 months. The stylists have said I could wait 3 months to get it re-cut, and possibly make it last 4. They weren't joking. That saves money and when you break it down, the price is comparable to most nicer salons.   I've found one of the truest tests of a good haircut is how well it grows out. Any cut can look good the first month (if styled properly and colored well) but only a FANTASTIC cut comes out looking good 2 months down the road without any styling or blow drying. If you can get it to look great 3 or 4 months down the road? Well that's beyond belief in my opinion.   I'm adventurous with my cuts, and they love that. They're not afraid to cut your hair in an extreme fashion if that's what you want. They're also very good about sticking to your original plan for your hair and not diverting you away from your idea (and thus having it come out being exactly the opposite of what you want). Even if you're not adventuresome, they are good at accommodating   The staff is excellent, very nice and helpful. I get my hair done by Mark, I highly recommend him!

Many of times I've overheard someone in passing talk about how "RA has the best sushi, ever!"  I've only eaten here once. It was one of the first places I ate after moving here from L.A. and man was I dissapointed. The first bite I took into the my tuna sashimi, I was greeted with a nice frozen center. Nothing like fresh...uhhhh....frozen sushi. I sent that back.   It's horribly overpriced too, not to mention douche/boob job central. I'd never pay that much for shitty sushi again.

I took my man here as a surprise for his 30th birthday. We got there pretty early and had a cocktail at the bar, and then another cocktail outside on their chick modern outdoor furniture. The bartender was one of the best we've had and recommended one of their speciality martinis. I tried a couple, and their citrus one was to die for. It was seriously the best drink I've had.   I made a reservation for sunset and scored one of the best views in the restaurant. Do yourself a favor and ask for a table right along the window so you have a great unobstructed view of the sunset. The views were the the most beautiful I've seen in the Valley. It was 180+ degrees of pure beauty.   I thought the dinner was fantastic, our service was good, and the ambiance made it worth the money. It's really pricey though, and while the food is great, it didn't blow me completely out of the water. It was by no means average, don't get me wrong, just not super-extremely-fantastic for how much it costs. I'd definitely go back for a special occasion!!

Everything was superb. It all blew me away. The wait staff was attentive to every need, the wine selection was very large, and most of all the food was to die for. There was nothing I had, from the appetizers, wine, main dish, and dessert that wasn't worthy of 5 stars. I do have to agree with others in saying that the price is better than other fine dining establishments that don't have as good of service, food, or presentation. .   I had the Cashew and Rosemary encrusted Salmon (see pictures). The fish was perfectly prepared and melted in the mouth. It had a mildly sweet but rich sauce that complimented the richness of the fish. My date asked the chef to surprise him. He made him roasted duck with vegetables and new potatoes. We also had french onion soup as an appetizer and another appetizer not on the menu...both were amazing.  The open kitchen made the experience unique, as you could see everything being prepared and plated. The owner was extremely gracious as he laughed and chatted it up with EVERY table in the restaurant. It was a very special experience. I can't wait to go back!

This place is like walking into a carbonated sugary wonderland! I love soda, LOVE LOVE LOVE it! I don't care that it's bad for me, makes me gain weight, and sends me into a super crazy sugar rush, I don't think I'll ever shake the taste I have for that super sweet treat.   Even though I stopped drinking it regularly years ago I still can't help myself when it comes to good quality soda (or even crap soda). I love it all. Most importantly, Pop the Soda Shop has an array of every flavor of micro brew soda you could imagine, as well as the major players. There's also quite a few selections made with cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup.  After asking staff what his recommendation was for great root beer, he helped us by explaining the difference in taste between brands. He knew  everything about their selection and directed us to the best root beer either of us had tasted.

Going on a tour here was seriously one of the coolest things I've done in Arizona. In fact it's one of the coolest things I've done...ever. I've traveled to different countries and been all through the United States, but something about the history of Frank Lloyd Wright, his personal life, and the amazing feats he undertook to build Taliesen West in the Scottsdale desert (before air conditioning, before the freeway system, before extensive road system) was amazing.   I've always loved Frank Lloyd Wright. Being an art nerd and a lover of architecture, I've been drawn to his work since childhood. I took friends from California here and although they're not as nerdy as I am about the stuff, they enjoyed themselves immensely. We did one of the extensive tours which took 2 or 3 hours, but  was worth every minute. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable on the intricacies of the structures, FLW's life, and random facts about the property and school.   I always recommend this place to people left and right...from people who have lived in Arizona their whole lives to those just visiting the Phoenix area. In my opinion, it's one of those "must sees" for everyone.

SWIHA is not only a school but a massage/bodywork clinic and yoga studio. You can take a class, get massaged, and drop into a yoga class all in the same day. Sounds like my type of school!!   They offer a variety of classes and programs like Massage Therapy, Holistic Nutrition, Yoga Teacher Training, Life Coaching, Hypnotherapy, Western Herbalism, Reflexology, Reiki, Polarity....the list goes on. You can get a comprehensive education and go for a degree in Holistic Health care or Mind-Body Transformational Psychology or you can just register for one class, whatever suits your needs.   It's an amazing place to learn about any alternative therapy. Right when you walk in the doors there's a very warm and welcoming atmosphere. After going through many of the various programs at the school, I highly recommend it for those looking to broaden their horizons in alternative therapies, or are themselves on the road to self-discovery and better health. They offer financial aid and are an award-winning private institution.   The yoga studio is fantastic and just so happens to be one of the cheapest studios in the valley. It's $10 for a drop-in class, but they offer monthly, 3 month, and 6 month passes which come out to way less than $10 a class. Also, all classes and passes are 10% off for students with ID and anyone over 50. The teachers are amazing. I highly recommend Cathie and Ann's classes on Tuesdays and Wednesdays!

I've been going to Pita Jungle since it opened, when you'd order at the counter (now the to-go counter) and there was no hipster staff. The place was the size of a shoe box and the food was always excellent. Something is to be said for the fact that I keep going back. Recently though, it seems like I've been chasing my own tail in that regard.   The vegetarian selection and portion sizes are superb. I'll give it that.   Unfortunately, the service is deplorable. I can get over the fact that they're slow...I mean, I can excuse it and not allow it to ruin my day. What's hard to get over is the fact that they rarely acknowledge it's taking forever, and/or always forget to refill drinks, and sometimes completely forget you exist when there's absolutely no one eating except you and another person at 3 PM on a Wednesday.  Also, the food is very hit and miss. The Tempe location seems to have a worse track record. Sometimes the tuna salad will have 3 lbs. of tuna, enough to gag you, but only 4 slivers of lettuce. Sometimes the rice is hot, sometimes it's cold. Sometimes the dressing tastes tangy, other times it's salty. The pita burrito either could have so many onions it makes you cry, other times it has virtually none. They frequently forget to put the cucumbers in the burrito as well. It's maddening!!!!!   It's as if their version of consistency is having a chef back there who's *juuuuuust* stoned enough to get the meals out in a little over an hour.   Also, their to-go orders are much smaller portion sizes than when you eat-in   I love the food, when it's a good day, and hence why I keep going back to achieve my fix. Every 5th time really impresses me. They have a wide vegetarian selection, pretty good hummus, and large enough portions to give you 2 meals. However the prices aren't that cheap. That coupled with inconsistent food and bad service tends to leave a bad taste in the mouth.  1 star on a bad day, 4 stars on a good day.

I know that the Coffee Plantation has been sold more times than a street walker's services. So, I'm sure that has something to do with the quality and atmosphere going through vicious cycles.  In the early  to late 90's you'd commonly have to hunt for a place to sit. They'd run happy hour deals during the week with the line of customers frequently reaching the door. There was live music and fun times to be had, people watching, and laughter everywhere. It was PACKED.  Everything about it has taken a nose dive... Multiple times. Gone are the days of the gigantic bean grinder and bean counter (more recently  the food counter). Gone are the days of good tasting coffee and awesome happy-hour-ness. Live music, great service, and fun people- no longer.  The last time I was there I was accosted by a surly customer saying I was infringing on his rights. I was at the long bar facing outward, with my camera pointed outside. He was on the bench outside on the phone doing god knows what, pacing back and forth like a drug addict. I didn't even notice him in my line of sight most of the time, as he was moving all over the place, but he marched right in and made it known I better not point that *damn* thing at him one more time, or else. Wow...talk about a crazy person! He implied I was doing illegal things by facing a camera at him. Wow. OK?!. He also looked to be on meth and was paranoid as  hell. Now I wouldn't dock the business just because of an unruly, crazy patron, but it left a sour taste in my mouth. When I informed the barista what happened, he seemed sincerely apologetic, but didn't do anything about it. He just stood there. I ended up having to pack up my stuff and leave for fear the guy was going to assault me. I also called the cops.   So, no more Coffee Plantation for me. The coffee really isn't worth it. The only thing they have going for them is their location.

I'm glad I read the not-so-great reviews before going here. I was expecting it to be a healthy vegan restaurant. It's definitely not that. The place is cool on the inside, trendy with some interesting decor. You order at the counter and they bring your food out to you. I do have to admit, for a restaurant that calls itself "Green" I was disappointed to only see styrofoam and plastic cups. Booo!  I got the samosas as a starter. They were a little spicy but waaaay too garlicky. I love garlic like no other but the amount they put in there made it taste like fried spicy garlic cloves. No thanks. The dipping sauce was too sweet too. For $4.50 it was a disappointment.  I also got the diablo red with mock chicken and brown rice. The rice was good but everything else was SOOOOOOOO SALTY, oh my god. Major turn-off #1. Hint- Just cuz it has Tamari as an ingredient doesn't mean you have to drown the "meat" and veggies in it. My friend had the sweet and sour mock chicken. She liked it but the noodles didn't look pan fried at all. That's just ghetto if you ask me. Maybe I was seeing things (and that's very possible, don't quote me on it) but they just looked like boiled rice noodles thrown on there.  Overall, I've made better vegan food at home. I may give it another try though, get something else and see if it's less salty/garlicky/sweet.

I've found Tempe Camera to be the most professional and courteous out of any I've been to, including all around Los Angeles.  The staff is very knowledgeable about their products and I've purchased many filters and cleaning equipment, on recommendation from their friendly staff. They've also done a great job cleaning my digital from time to time.   I accidentally smashed my brand new DSLR on the tile floor a couple mos. after I bought it, lens side down. The UV filter shattered glass everywhere and jammed itself into the lens. I figured I broke my very expensive camera and lens but thankfully I brought it to Tempe Camera, where they diagnosed it on the spot and said they would be able to get it working again. Three days later, they had it back to me. The lens didn't break, and they were able to pry off the filter without damaging any parts.  They also didn't charge me for it! Honestly, they're my heroes! I would have gladly paid. :)  The most valuable thing I've found is they don't have an attitude, and treat all their customers the same, whether they are professional photogs, students, or amateurs. I've had bad experiences elsewhere, especially when I was a Photo student, mainly because I had the label of student. I've always been appreciative that Tempe Camera takes the time to explain their products, and never gives you the sense that you are asking "dumb questions."

What I like about Casey Moore's (other than the obvious drunkenness) is that it's a converted house. I'm a sucker for anything that's not in a strip mall and the fact that it's in the historic Maple-Ash neighborhood in Tempe is a bonus. It's neat to sit and drink on the large patio and watch people walk to their homes or on their way to Mill Ave. I'm always jealous of those people. If I could afford one of those houses, I'd move there and frequent Casey Moore's every week. Being walking distance from such a cool bar? Score. It's a nice change to have brews on their large patio and enjoy the winter or spring weather.

This is another one of those restaurants I would have never known about if it wasn't for Yelp. San Diego Bay Restaurant is tucked away in the corner of a shopping center on the main drag in Guadalupe.  It's taken me a long time to review this place. The first time I went was over two years ago and I've been back a few times.  I have to admit, I've never had better Mexican seafood.   Unfortunately since it's been awhile, I've forgotten what I ordered. I can tell you this though, every dish has been superb. Each bite was like heaven. I left wanting to try everything on the menu.   The servers always steered me towards great dishes with their recommendations and I've taken many people here, much to their delight. They've all raved about it.

I frequently travel all the way from Gilbert just to eat here. 35 miles of driving which has always been well worth it. I've tried the one in Mesa but I don't find it to be as good as the original. They have amazing New Mexican style cuisine. I do love it spicy though, and they're the spiciest mexican food I've ever had. They do have a lot of non spicy stuff too. Out of town guests I've taken, who aren't into anything spicy, have found it to be very good. I think the milder part of the menu have been just as appetizing, sometimes moreso because you're not sweating bullets and downing 5 glasses of water just to make the burn go away.   You can wait a long time for a table, so be prepared to wait, but if you go during off times, like after the lunch crowd or right before the dinner crowd you shouldn't have a wait. The margaritas will kick your ass too. Get a pitcher and make it a day drinking, hotter than hell Mexican extravaganza.

I ate here on a Sunday evening, the place was relatively busy but not as packed as I've heard it gets on Friday and Saturday nights. We were seated right away on the cute little patio outside, facing the back of the restaurant I might add, so you get none of the noise from Scottsdale Rd. They've really made the outside look quaint and inviting, both in the front and the back.   I was a little surprised to see the high prices on the menu but I think that's just because I'm skeptical of any Mexican/Southwestern restaurant that's expensive. I've been disappointed in the past. I ordered the Carne en chile colorado (chunks of beef in a guajillo sauce, spinach and potatoes) and after a few bites I knew I ordered the right thing. Although I have a feeling ordering anything on the menu would have been "the right thing."   The party I was with all loved their entrees and we all enjoyed sipping our Patron Silver Margaritas. Usually I don't get too excited over Margaritas at a restaurant because they all taste the same to me but I especially liked that this one wasn't crazy-super sweet and that it was strong, of course. The sweetness can sometimes make me feel like I ate a bowl of candy but not these. I'm sure the Patron Silver had something to do with it too. ;-P  The service was a little spotty as our waitress didn't come around much and I asked for water I didn't receive. Although I  was already done with most of my meal before I remembered, and by that time it wasn't a concern. The  food was so good I didn't care.

This type of club usually isn't my scene. Gotta say that up front. A friend from out of town likes the place though and got a VIP balcony room with bottle service. Needless to say that's seriously the way to go. If you can get a bunch of friends together, there's no way you can't have fun up there. We had two private bartenders which were very cool and attentive, the bouncers upstairs were also nice. We got to the front of the line, had no cover. It was pretty pimp. The music was ok. Would I go here again and stand in that line and not be VIP? No, but then again it's not my scene to begin with.

Our group of 3 wound up at Carly's after an event at the Dodge Theater. We were starving and wanted a quick bite and a drink. We first went to the Roosevelt but they stopped serving food at 11 so we walked to Carly's instead.  About two years ago I stumbled into Carly's one afternoon on a whim, not knowing what it was or being terribly familiar with the area. I remember the service being somewhat slow. I was in there for about an hour but it was also a weekday and very busy.   Even so I wanted to try it again, mainly for their beer selection. I nearly had a heart attack as I was waiting for my sandwich because I saw they had Chimay on tap. I had to do a double take. I've found in general Arizona bars/pubs have an extremely poor selection of beers on tap. To find some good Belgian Ales is like finding a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. There's always the rare gem of a bar/pub here and there that serves some killer stuff and Carly's is one of those places.  Fast forward to recently...in my daze of hunger and my recent quest to find the best bloody mary in the Phx area, I totally forgot how excellent Carly's brew selection was. I ordered a bloody mary and Europa sandwich instead. Both were very good, in fact it was the best bloody mary I've ever had so I'm glad I forgot about the beer.   It was interesting that the beer was $8 (but being reverse happy hour it was only $7) and my bloody mary was $4.50. Usually it's the other way around but I guess I'm not surprised considering their good selection on tap.  It would have been nice to have a little more than a spoonful of pasta salad with the sandwich. Other than that, everything was fantastic!! I'll definitely be back to try the beer and eat.

This little spot can get really packed. The first time I was here there was a 20 minute wait. The 2nd time the restaurant was full, even though it was pretty late (about noon) on Sunday.   The coffee was excellent, strong and dark, and they set the pitcher on your table so you can get really caffeinated up. :)  The food and service was great. They've got some interesting breakfast selections on the menu. I'm not into sour cream, cream cheese, or feta on my eggs but for those a little more adventurous for breakfast, I'm sure would find those selections great.   I just ordered eggs mixed with vegetables, potatoes, and cheese in a skillet. Very tasty. I guess next time I'll take the advice of others here and order the french toast! Yum.

This place holds a special place in my heart. The Mesa Amphitheater is literally 1 mile from my childhood home. I'd ride my bike daily through the parking lot to get to the Mesa Library...ahhh memories!   I saw a few bands there as a teenager and more recently, Death Cab for Cutie this summer. It's somewhat of a hidden oasis because as we all know, that area of Mesa has seen its share of better days. Yet, the inside of the Amp. remains virtually the same and very well maintained.  You can purchase tickets at the box office, free from all Ticketmaster charges. If you live in the east part of the valley, it's much better to just drive over there and pick them up instead of paying the outrageous fees.   The entire venue is covered in lush tiered lawn, making it surprisingly cooler even in the summer months. Note, it's by no means *cool* temperature wise but it definitely drops a few degrees by being so grassy. I like outdoor venues. I'd take an outdoor venue any day over a  hellish sound reverberation indoor venue. You can see from anywhere in the place and the sound is good. Because of its bowl shape, it also provides plenty of shade in the late afternoon when you're waiting for the band to come on.   I enjoy the fact that you can easily park for cheap ($5) and get out relatively easily, or park in the neighborhood across Center St., get out even easier, and pay nothing.   The only problem I had was with the security being retarded about the camera I tried to bring in. Although it's a digital SLR and fairly large, the brawny nasty security lady snidely remarked "If the camera was as big as that bag, that there was NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WAAAAAAAAAAAY I'm letting that in!" A simple, "Sorry, there's no large cameras allowed" would have been appreciated.   Don't try to bring in blankets either, for some reason an outdoor venue with grass thinks blankets are a sin.

What's most notable about Changing Hands is all the well known authors they've had for speaking engagements/book signings. The list is quite impressive!   The frequent stamp cards are nice, as are the great selection of books, but I find myself drifting over to the gift section more often than not. I especially like their great selection of unique cards, hand painted wooden things, bookmarks, beautiful journals, and Solari bells. I think I've spent just as much on cute little things for myself as I have books!

This pub/restaurant is a nice addition to the area. It's located in the newer Dana Park outdoor mall which is kind of an upscale, trendy shopping area.   The bar itself was pretty nice and the bartenders were attentive. The food was surprisingly good considering it's a chain. It didn't look or feel like a chain which was a definite plus. I had a salad and nachos which I thought were both pretty tasty. The drink prices are a little high but they do have Guinness on draft. I suppose since it's in that nicer shopping area, you pay the "nicer" prices.   All in all, it's a good find for the area. Afterall, east Mesa is not the hippest of places so a good local pub is a nice find. I probably wouldn't travel from across the valley just for a nice cold Guiness here but I've had a few fun nights with friends. Also have met some pretty interesting folks sitting at the bar, to which we drank together and shared stories. That's usually a sign of a good night.

I've been here numerous times for their Sunday buffet. It is so tasty! Everything from pitas, rice, hummus, chicken, gyro meat, salad, lentil soup, tabouli, kalmata olives, and various other rotating dishes are all so good. The regular stuff on the menu seems a little pricey but the buffet is always priced right and very, very good!  The service is great. The cute woman working the weekends is talkative and funny. All of the staff make you feel right at home while you're eating. Their garlic sauce is crazy good, I highly recommend asking for that! They'll get you some from the back because they don't put it on the buffet line. That with the chicken?! Oh my gosh. Yum.

I went here this past weekend to see DJ Icey who spins breakbeats. First, I have to tell you I was really, really excited to see him as I've never gotten to see him live.   His set was amazing, but there were two main complaints. First, the sound system and secondly, the fact that you couldn't see anything he was doing behind the decks. I really wish Myst would PLEASE realize that those of us who come here to see the DJs don't want to see some tripped out screen saver playing a loop on the only TVs where you can see the DJ spin. This isn't a rave in the middle of the desert, although if it was, I guarantee you it would be a lot cooler. Since they elevated the DJ booth to the second floor (mistake #1) they've had to put screens up so you can see the DJ spin. The other times I've been, the screens have had a constant feed of the decks without stupid visuals playing, which has been great. This time though, I couldn't see shit, just screen savers. I don't like to get pissy about stuff like this, but really, I'm kind of annoyed. When you pay $10 or $15 bucks just to get in, and more on drinks, you really expect top quality production and most importantly, to see the DJ! wtf?! There's only two things I care about when I go out to see any DJ...First, that I can somehow see him/her spin,  that's f*in obvious, and secondly, that the sound is decent. For a venue like this, the sound should be banging.   Myst gets a big fat FAIL for both. The distortion was really obvious this weekend, and probably more noticeable because everything was so bass heavy. I'd think for a club that pulls such amazing talent, which probably rakes in a decent amount of  $dough$ each weekend, they'd spend a good chunk of their budget on getting the sound system up to snuff. Yet, it seems like they've invested thousands into the seizure-inducing lights but a LOT less in any type of sound upgrades. I mean, can we get mother f*in bass bins up in there? It's not a rock concert venue, we don't need more treble, trust me. In fact, the sound was so distorted, I had to cover my ears at one point because they literally felt like they were bleeding. This is a venue for bass-heavy electronic music, and it's a shame when you can't even hear the full range of the music on a gigantic system. It has such potential to be a great venue, minus the lame crowd, because the space is beautiful. I just don't get it. Really, I don't. Each time I go back I'm more and more disappointed.

After a trip on the light rail, I decided to check this place out since it was right by my stop.   I got the lunch special and ordered a veggie slice which came with a side salad and coke for $5.50. Thankfully I got there right before a bunch of people on their lunch break. Those poor people were waiting 10 minutes in line just to order. Perhaps it was because a woman in front of them just ordered 2 full pizzas, but it still seemed odd that it took so long just to get their orders taken. Two people obviously didn't want to wait because they got out of line and went somewhere else.   The sauce had no real flavor, the crust was doughy, and sadly the green peppers and red onions were very chewy and unedible. I had to pull all of them off. The pizza was falling apart, which I don't mind, as long as it tastes great.  The salad was just iceberg lettuce with two cubes of tomatoes and way too much ranch dressing. :( I wouldn't go back.

I've eaten here dozens of times, the pizza is sooooooo good!! Definitely the best I've had in the E. Valley. It's really cheap too, and every time you buy a pizza they give you a Las Vegas style chip. After your 10th chip, you get a free pizza. WooHoo!!  The owner is always working. He's very nice and always busting ass in the open-air kitchen putting pizzas in. The servers are all very, very friendly & make you feel at home. They expanded the restaurant and started serving beer about a year and a half ago, so there's more than the 6 or so tables they used to have.   The decor is funky and painted all sorts of crazy colors. One booth has a bunch of CD's under the glass. It's all very unique and funky. I just love it, am tickled by it, and take everyone I know here.

After the last time of going to Cosmo and having my dog attacked by a dog who's owners couldn't control it, I didn't think I'd be back to the park (even though I had been plenty of times without incident) but I did go back this evening.   I figured it had been about 6 months and I really do enjoy taking her. She loves it. I should have re-read my past review about telling myself I'd NEVER go back in the evenings. And here's why...  To be honest, I wasn't expecting anything bad to happen. My dog was having her usual fun time but within 5 minutes of entering, a small dog got attacked by a larger dog and all you could hear was crazy amounts of yelping and whining like the dog was being eaten. It was a horrible sound. The owner of the small dog started crying hysterically, running towards the dog, arms outstretched screaming like a banchee. Now, of course it's not her fault her dog is being attacked but she definitely was escalating the situation by acting this way. Don't any of these people watch The Dog Whisperer? Geez. :P Energy people. CALM, ASSERTIVE energy. Fuck, it's not hard.  So this fight between the two dogs is still going on. About 15 seconds into it, it turned into an all out brawl with 6 other dogs going ape-shit on this little dog and then each other. IAnd THEN, as if things couldn't get any worse...every dog in the park started running over to the scuffle. First thing I thought was, "It's time to get the FUCK OUTTA HERE!"   The group of dog owners converged in the entry way to the park, apparently to talk out the situation, while hysterical lady kept crying. Some words were exchanged between owners & I decided it was time to excuse myself. Mind you, I had my dog leashed at this point. She was healing & completely under my voice command. I made her sit and stay at the gate, in front of all these people and their dogs. I went first and she followed, all on my voice commands.   It made me feel like I accomplished something to have my dog under my control while there was complete chaos ensuing around me.   If you can't even get control over your 10 lb. dog in most circumstances, please for the love of god, DON'T TAKE THEM TO THE DOG PARK. And if you don't have control of your 70 lb. dog, DON'T TAKE THEM TO THE DOG PARK.

This place is just awesome. I keep going back because nothing beats it. The place is very unassuming, being sandwiched between a bank and a Checker Auto Parts. It's easy to pass it by but don't let the strip mall fool you, they have EXCELLENT fish and service. The interior is chic and modern. Sit at the large sushi bar and get the full experience.   The albacore tuna tataki melts in the mouth & has a delectable sauce on top. They also have a wide array of house specialty rolls.The ultimate spicy tuna roll is nothing short of amazing. It has spicy tuna on the inside with asparagus (which gives it a nice texture and light crunch) and tuna on the outside. I've taken so many out-of-town guests from California and they've all been just as pleased.  They have a nice assortment of awards on the walls, and it's no surprise why.

This place changed owners a couple of years ago. I went a couple of times after the owner change. The decor changed a little. Service was friendly but honestly everything was not nearly as good. I was pretty disappointed. Rice was too warm, rolls were falling apart & not the same, sashimi was not that good. I never came back. Oh well, it was great while it lasted.

I am really super picky when it comes to stylists. I feel like many places are expensive just to be expensive, most notably the extremely overpriced day spa/hair styling/massage/pedicure/manicure/jewelry line selling monstrosities around the valley.   After having a sub par experience at one of those places I decided to give Ulta a try. They were running their holiday deal. A cut and accent highlights for $50! Super cheap!  Lacey Jo did my cut and color, during the morning of Christmas Eve. I felt like she understood exactly what I wanted and didn't need too much guidance. I got a graduated bob that I wanted very short in the back. The last place I went to, the stylist pushed me against going super short in the back saying something about it not working well with my hair type. I found that to be odd considering I had it done before and it worked well.   Thankfully Lacey Jo didn't say any such garbage and cut it how I wanted, which was fabulous! She massaged my scalp for what seemed like 15 minutes when she washed it (heaven) and was very nice and personable throughout the experience.   The great thing is, it's only $40 for a cut and $50 for the accent highlights normally which is WAY cheaper than so many other places out there. I was so thrilled with my service here that I booked out my next appointment upon leaving, something I never do.

I really love Bookmans. Their huge selection of used books is the best in the valley. In many instances they have a much broader selection of harder-to-find books, in store, than all the retail chains, and I've found that even when the retail chains have what I'm looking for, they always have to order it because they don't have it stocked.   Specifically I bought a book recently on alternative healing from Amazon. I  paid $4 over the cover price (unknowingly) because I wanted it so badly and couldn't find it new in any store. I didn't even think to go to Bookmans, but when I was there this past weekend, I saw TWO copies of that book in very good condition for less than half the cover price. It shouldn't have surprised me but it did. The store always surprises me. They've got such a wide array of stuff, from electronics to used magazines to DVDs. It's a bargain shopper/reader/collector's paradise~!

Bookman's has been totally remodeled and looks great! All the aisles are more easily navigated and the store seems to flow much better. Before it Not that I thought it was bad before but you can tell they've put a lot of effort into making the book shopping experience easier for customers.   The multimedia section has expanded too and is no longer cramped into a small area.  They've also added a lot more seating! There's tons of comfy chairs and couches to lounge on while looking through their enormous selection of books. Yay!

In all of my shopping adventures at The Rack, I've found each day can be hit or miss. Some days they have very little selection of high quality clothing and other times I've seen $700 high-end designer dresses marked down to $30. They key, I've found, is to go on the days when their new merchandise arrives straight from Nordstrom.   I somehow got on the Nordstrom mailing list, which I don't mind because they send postcards with the dates of these fashion events when new shipments arrive. These are the dates when the best selection of designer clothing comes straight from Nordstrom. So, if you can make it a point to show up, you're bound to find what you're looking for at a bargain.

I have to admit, I normally don't like Chinese food. In fact, it's just about the only style of food I haven't fallen in love with at some point in my life. This is a real problem when you live with someone that would die for Chinese food at all hours of the day/night.   I figured out why I never liked Chinese food when I first ate at Asian Cafe Express. It's because everything I've had has been Americanized Chinese Food!!!  It was like an epiphany and seriously music to my tastebuds when I actually found Chinese food I not only liked, I LOVED! Having authentic Chinese food changed my opinion completely about this cuisine.  I have to agree with the others... save yourself the time and skip the first few pages. Go straight to the back of the menu to find authentic Hong Kong Style fare. Holy mother of god, everything I've tried has been outstanding and each time I leave saying it was the best meal I've tried thus far.   Everything is extremely cheap and the service is superb. The wait staff are always very helpful and knowledgeable about their food. They'll be quick to recommend something if you're having a hard time deciding. Just ask!

I've only been to Rolf's once. Never again.   I had my color done previously at Vidal Sassoon. Instead of going back and paying more, I decided to go to Rolf's. Afterall it was only a few miles from my house and about $30 cheaper. What a HUGE mistake.   My color still looked pretty good when I went in. It was red with blonde highlights. As people with dyed red hair know, it fades quickly. Even though my hair still looked "ok" it definitely was fading, especially the bottom half.   Here's the problem. My stylist only colored the top half of my hair and left the bottom completely untouched. I was totally confused. Was I paying for JUST a touch up? Should I ask her WHY she's doing this? Am I going to have to pay extra if I ask her to do the bottom half? Why didn't she do the bottom half? WTF is going on?   I went home and looked at it in the mirror and knew something was wrong. I had to leave town for the weekend and when I came back I called the salon. They weren't very helpful but said I could come in and she'd take a look at it. I never went back, I guess I should have because after a month it looked like total crap because it faded all weird.  I was just really annoyed with the whole process and didn't feel like dealing with it anymore. I found another stylist who informed me that Rolf's hires many of their stylists straight out of beauty school.  She's been in the business 20 years. I trust her knowledge.   I refuse to pay tons of money for inexperienced stylists under the guise of being a high end, shi shi, froufrou salon. No thanks!

After reading all the good reviews of the other Mesa Crackers and Co, I went to this one because it's closer to my house.   I don't know what all the hype is about. I found it to be just about the blandest, most boring, overpriced breakfast I've had in a long time. I got the Vatican which is a skillet with eggs cooked to order, hash browns, red and green bell pepper, onion, mushrooms, and bits of bacon along with sausage and cheese all mixed together. I got the cheese on the side and ended up not putting much on. It was about $8.50.  First, the sausage wasn't breakfast sausage, or perhaps it's like no breakfast sausage I've seen. It appeared to be Italian sausage or some rendition. The pieces were big and not my cup of tea at all. I'd have much rather had traditional breakfast sausage. It's clearly the standard, why mess with it? Maybe becuase it's called "The Vatican" but still, I wished it was marked on the menu that the sausage was different. I pulled all of them off my plate, I disliked them so much.   The skillet had no seasoning whatsoever. I'm not a big fan of salt but it tasted like they didn't put any salt on anything, or any seasoning for that matter. I had to salt my food which I never do. Usually I think things are too salty eating out.   The hashbrowns were pretty good but it's hard to mess that up. Nothing else was tasty. I ended up dumping Cholula over the whole thing which made it more edible. It was relatively greasy for how unflavorful it was. Even the english muffin that came on the side was flat and not very doughy. Most of the wait staff seemed pretty nice but our waitress wasn't all that great and only checked on us once even though she passed every 2 minutes to get to other tables.   I would not try this place again. Their desserts did look good if you're into that thing.

I really adore this place. They've got some of the best lentil soup around and all of their chicken dishes have been perfectly seasoned and very, very juicy. I recently got the kabob plate and it came out so tender and juicy it was falling apart on my fork. Their hummus and garlic sauce are both very good as well and the service is quick and friendly.   Last time I was in, I noticed they expanded their dining section so the place is a bit bigger now, probably to accommodate the increase in customers from the park-and-ride light rail station right in front of their restaurant.  Do yourself the favor. If you're heading on the light rail and feel hunger strike, stop off here and enjoy a nice meal. They have good lunch specials around $7.50 for a full plate with meat, hummus, garlic sauce, pita, and tabouli. Mmmm!

I've been out to Save Your Dairy a few times and have been very impressed.   The health benefits of raw milk are astronomical. During the industrial revolution people in this country were becoming sick from unpasteurized milk as all milk was raw. The milking process was extremely unhygienic so laws were passed to skirt the actual issue of cleaning up the dairies. Instead they pasteurized it to kill *most of the deadly organisms but at the same time killed all the health promoting benefits. PEOPLE were spreading diseases, the milk was just the carrier. In essence, while milk became "more hygienic" it killed the very essence that gave it its health promoting properties in the first place.   Making sure your raw milk comes from a clean and trusted source gives enthusiasts the piece of mind needed when consuming milk that's not pasteurized. If you're informed or care to inform yourself on the common misconceptions and downright lies of raw milk, please do so. Your eyes will be blown wide open.   Raw milk promotes extremely healthy teeth and bones. Many people raised on a more traditional diet (very health promoting, non western diet) have been seen to have radically different teeth structure. The case has been made that raw milk especially helps children in developing strong teeth. My fiance was raised on raw milk and he has absolutely no cavities and neither do his sisters.   It's also been said that some people who are allergic or intolerant to pasteurized dairy products may be able to drink/eat raw dairy products and not suffer the same reactions. Not everyone, but some.   When you drive in, the first thing you notice are the cows happily relaxing and grazing on the farm. The people have always been very helpful and knowledgeable. The actual storefront is pretty small, just a front room with a couple of see-through refrigerators with gallons of milk. They're $8 each and I'd recommend bringing some sort of cooler for the long drive home.   I've heard they Healthy Habit in Phoenix sells Save Your Dairy milk so if you're closer to Phoenix, I'd suggest picking it up from there (mind you it is more expensive). I can't rave about this place enough.

The bagels here are as good as they get! They make  bagels the real way, in-house everyday from scratch. The cream cheeses are all made in-house too and are delectable, they have about 10 different types. The lox and lox cream cheese are my personal favorites. The bagels are deliciously moist and chewy with just the right amount of toastiness. They have homemade muffins and cakes, as well as the standard espresso and coffee drinks.  They also offer half-price bagels to-go during the last hour they're open, between 1-2 PM. The inside is well decorated and the owners are super nice and accommodating. Definitely worth checking out!!

I've been here twice, both on Saturday nights. One time to see friends from L.A. spin extremely sick old school hip hop downstairs. The second to hear house music upstairs.   The layout of the place is cool. There's a lot of seating and room to dance downstairs. The upstairs has a nice sitting area with a couple of couches and two bars. What I really like about the place is it has a nice eclectic mix of people. That's very refreshing for Phoenix, seriously. It's also nice to have found good electronic music with a good crowd, that's there for the music and to dance.  The upstairs does get packed but there was a pretty big circle of dancers going all night, which made the cramped quarters not seem so bad, getting to watch them all get down. That's something I haven't seen since I left L.A. and it made my night. The sound system upstairs is music to the ears and the bartenders also were amazingly fast considering they were packed.   I really like this place. It makes me happy. I'll go back

I've been back a few times since the last review but the most notable was to see DJ Z-Trip. He was awesome, no complaints there.  Bar Smith though? They failed on so many levels.   I got there sometime between 10:30 and 11:00 and there was about a 20 minute wait out front. Not the end of the world or anything but after finally getting in, there was a sea of bodies and another very long wait. About 50 people were lined up by the stair case waiting to get upstairs. There was a bouncer not allowing anyone up there until people would slowly trickle out. Why they put Z-Trip on the patio, I don't know. It's the size of a shoe box and was clearly to capacity before 11 PM. FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL!!   I was in various lines roughly 50 minutes and still hadn't made it upstairs. Forget about stepping out of line to get a drink because you'd lose your place. The short of it is I paid for pre sale tickets, managed to get there at a decent time, and still had to wait close to an hour just to get in the same room as the guy. It was a total let down.   At that point I was so ready to just walk out and ask for my money back. They clearly oversold the event and didn't give much thought about their patrons who paid money to see this DJ. They were going to fit every last body into that place if it killed them...and everyone else in there.   After finally getting upstairs there were so many bodies, no one could move at all. It was a total clusterfuck. I finally made it to the back bar and stood in line for 10 minutes just to find out their card reader broke earlier in the night. Fantastic. No signs saying it was a cash bar, that would have been a nice gesture.   Also, the bathrooms were downstairs, so forget about having to pee AT ALL during the 2+ hours you're there. If you had to go, you better hold it, otherwise you'd be waiting in line for another 30 minutes just to get back up.   By the time Z-Trip came on, the sound was bass heavy and mildly distorted. I inched my way to various parts of the patio but the sound didn't get any better, so my partner and I said fuck it and went downstairs for the rest of the night. Thankfully they were playing his set downstairs and upstairs. At least people could move more easily downstairs. Plus the sound was better. And the bathrooms were actually accessible.   Even at the end of the night, there were people standing in line waiting to get upstairs. Bar Smith gets a huge "F" as far as I'm concerned. I won't be back to this place for any headlining DJ. They obviously don't know how to run an event.

They have GLUTEN FREE PITAS!!!!!!!!!!!! And they're fuggin cheap! Like $3.50 a package or something ridiculous like that. You can sub your pita with your meal for a GF pita at no cost.  I'm eating one as I type this, no joke. I'm now a starch addict again thanks to Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli. I don't know if that's a good thing or not ;)   Seriously, I can't say enough good things about this place. Their rice is to-die-for. The lamb and kafta kabobs are the best. I've found the chicken kabobs can be a little dry at times so I generally go for the darker meats. The salads are the best I've ever had, their dressing is amazing. Oh, and their lemonade is the best. It's made with rose water and honey, you HAVE to try it! I'm not a huge lemonade drinker so I usually get an Arnold Palmer to cut the sweetness, or as the owner likes to call it, an "Arnold Schwarzenegger." Seriously, get the lemonade or an Arnold Schwarzenegger, you won't be disappointed.   Every Friday I work in downtown Phoenix and come here to pick up a multiple packs of gluten-free pitas and get a fab lunch. I always think I'll try someplace else close to downtown but I just can't pass this place up.   The owner is super knowledgeable about his food and extremely sweet. Everyone that works there is very, very friendly and knowledgeable. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!

I'm surprised to see the low ratings for this place. I think it's fantastic!!  There's still not a whole lot going on in this area. It's still cow-town, farming central for Gilbert, although a lot has popped up recently. When this restaurant rolled into town, I was thrilled.   First, they try to get all their produce from their local farm 1st. If they can't supply everything for their restaurant from their farm, they buy from local farmers 2nd, and then (and only then) will they go out-of-state for their produce. Also, their meat is naturally raised from AZ. Local produce + local meat = are you kidding me?!?! They deserve 5 stars for that alone! They also have recycling bins for your cups and plates. If more restaurants would follow suit in these aspects, do you know how much waste can be saved, or how much this BOOSTS our local economy, or how much healthier we would be as a society? Supporting business that buy locally is not only FAR nutritionally superior because the transit time decreases, but people generally don't get a side of pesticides, herbicides, hormones, and antibiotics with their meal when you buy locally. So, A+++ for the fact that Joe's Farm Grill has gotten on board with this and really taken it above and beyond what most establishments in this price range are willing to do, or even want to do.   I didn't know they had naturally raised meat until I caught it on the Food Network, and that made me even happier. I've always been amazed at their charbroiled hamburgers- they've been some of the best I've had. The fries are groovy too. I've had a salad as well as the grilled cheese. The salad was large and delicious but there was something lurking in it that was making it taste "strange." I think it was just my own personal preference though. The grilled cheese had Fontina in it, and as I found out the hard way, Fontina is gross. I should have known...I don't like weird cheeses on traditional American white trash food. They taste like dirty socks in my mouth. If I knew what Fontina tasted like I wouldn't have gotten it, that's my bad.  It's more expensive than your average fancier burger joint, but nothing too outrageous.   It's fun to sit outside on a cool day under the gigantic trees, and look out to the farm and houses think to yourself that one day, not too long ago, all of it was farm land as far as the eye could see.

Simply put, it's the best independent coffee shop in the Valley. The atmosphere, especially on the outside patio is like stepping into another part of the country. They have flowers, upon flowers, upon flowers!  It's wonderful getting to sip coffee in what feels like your own private rose garden, while falling back into comfy patio furniture. All of this while looking out onto the organic farm in Agritopia. It definitely doesn't feel like Arizona.   I absolutely love how they've decorated the place. It's 50's retro mixed with modern design, all with a bit of country charm.  The espresso drinks are excellent and their baked goods are to die for! The staff is always friendly and helpful. One thing I really enjoy is the gigantic wooden table that seats 8. It's nice to sprawl out when studying, reading the paper, or just when you have a large group with you.

What I like most about this place is they're constantly rotating out their Gelato, make it themselves each week, and have really interesting flavors that you don't see most places.  There was some sort of gelato made with a type of wine or alcohol, gosh I sound silly because I don't remember which, but it was so interesting. That flavor wasn't my cup of tea but everything else I've tried has been fantastic!   Both the husband and wife owner have been there every time I've come in and are more than willing to let you know what ingredients they use, their processes, etc. Highly recommended!

Located in another unassuming strip mall in Mesa, there's Matta's. It's relatively easy to spot. When you walk in you order at the counter and you're then escorted by a hostess to a free table. You get your own drink and they bring you chips and salsa.   I ordered the special shredded beef taco plate (forgot the name) but the shell is deep fried and very good. It was near perfection, the beef was fantastic and moist and the rice and beans were great. The place was packed on a Friday night. Fifteen minutes after we arrived there was a line of 10 people waiting for tables. It appears to get busy but they bring the food out so fast, you more than likely don't have to wait very long for a seat. The salsa is also great and just the right amount of spicy which is so important.   My date got the ground beef tacos and while it was good it's no shredded beef. I wouldn't recommend it, that's something that can easily be made at home. Shredded beef is always where it's at.

I was in the area doing some shopping, and both my man and I decided it was time to eat. Unfortunately it was only 10:30 AM so we needed a place that was open early. Chompie's it was. I've had both their breakfast and sandwiches and I hate to rate it so low but honestly, I just don't get it. It's all Eh...alright. It's very standard deli food, definitely nothing mind blowing. I think the fact there's an actual deli in Tempe gets people excited more than anything, because there's not a whole hell of a lot of deli/restaurants around.   The menu IS huge so there's a lot to choose from. They have a wide array for breakfast and a lot of healthier options. Unfortunately I've always left feeling like it wasn't worth the money. I got one of their chicken sandwiches and the chicken was overcooked, dry, and the grilled vegetables on top were soggy. I've had the pastrami before, and while tasting okay, it wasn't super-juicy and melt in your mouth. I'm obviously spoiled.  I've been to some outstanding Jewish and Italian deli's in LA- namely Langer's and Philippe's in the heart of downtown. There's so many good delis in the huge metropolises, but not so much around Phoenix. Sorry Chompie's, you just don't do it for me. I like the bloody mary's and pickles though!

As much as I like Gameworks, you can't drink and drive at Gameworks! I like the fact you can drink, drink, drink to your hearts content and then play video games with other stupidly drunk adults at Dave and Buster's!  I've been to many D&B's in CA and they were all much larger, had a wider selection of games, and were decorated to a tee. This place doesn't quite live up, however there's always a place in my heart for Dave and Buster's, no matter how small and cheezy because I can drink ALCOHOL while slamming tokens into a game to win lots of tickets. Whee!   They've got a pretty decent happy hour too. The food is blech, wouldn't eat it again and it's expensive too. Everything else makes me happy. I was soooooooooo happy to see a Dave and Buster's finally make it to Arizona!

This has got to be the most awesome pet store ever. They deliver high end quality pet food all around the valley for free! However, if you pick it up in their store in west Mesa, they give you a 10% discount!  I've been getting their food delivered or picking it up for my dogs for 3 years now. They're wonderful.  They carry top of the line natural dog food (cat and other animals too) like Innova (EVO), California Natural, Canidae, etc. They also carry some brands you can purchase at your local pet food store.   There aren't many places around the Phoenix area that carry the highest end dog food or if they do, they don't deliver, or they're far from where I live. Goober's prices are right and the staff is always very courteous and friendly. You can also order online now, and even schedule delivery for the same time every month when you run out of food so you'll never accidentally forget to call.  The only thing I wished is that they would carry Orijen. I've wanted to see how my dogs do on the food but since they don't carry it and I'm too lazy to go to another place, it'll have to wait.

Sitting outside on the patio was the best decision we made. They have a nice modern fireplace and heat lamps when it gets cold. It's fully walled off and intimate. They had a great live band too. The decor of the place is great, I especially liked the bar with reddish glass all around. It's one of the first things you notice about the restaurant and I do have to say, they've done it right.   Our party shared the gigantic seafood tower with oysters, prawns, king crab legs, crab claws, and lobster as an appetizer. It was a 3-tiered UFO looking thing that landed on our table, complete with dry ice smoking at the top. I'm not the hugest fan of lobster or crab but my dining partners thought it was excellent. I enjoyed the prawns and oysters immensely.  The Swordfish I ordered left something to be desired (don't know what I was thinking ordering fish at a steakhouse) but I didn't like it very much, it was bland and a bit too firm for my liking. I also was disappointed to see farmed salmon on the menu, and it wasn't cheap either! I wouldn't expect farmed fish at any restaurant this expensive.  However the sides we got were TO DIE FOR! The lobster mashed potatoes and crab gnocchi made up for the fish. They were so decadent and insanely tasty, each bite was like a piece of heaven, and I don't even like crab or lobster by themselves so that's saying a lot!!   Our server recommended the butter cake with ice cream on top. It came with a vat of homemade whipped cream, larger than the size of the cake to dip it in. You could have given me a spoon and I would have just eaten the whipped cream alone! Also had the creme brule. I've had better but it was still good.    It was definitely spendy. Don't know if all the food is necesarally worth the price but I would go back just for the sides and also to do it proper and get a steak!

I was expecting much more from Fresh & Easy. With all the hype about how wonderfully fresh and quick it was, I was expecting more. I couldn't find one damn package of broccoli florets that didn't have yellowing around the ends. Whatever. I bought it anyway, hoping it wouldn't taste bitter. Surprise, surprise...I got it home and it was disgusting. I should have known.  I went to their section for pre packaged meals and was let down. For a store that's wanting to cater to the hip, environemental, organic, healthy crowd, almost everything they sold had Canola oil in it. Dude, vegetable oils are disgusting and highly processed. Like everything had canola oil in it and that shows me they are  c-h-e-a-p  asses in production.   Secondly out of about 60 prepackaged meals, only 2 were allergen free. Everything pre packaged had at least one of the top allergens as ingredients, but most of them had 2 or 3! WTF? Can't I get one thing without wheat, eggs, dairy, nuts, or soy? Let alone like have all of them in the meal? That rules out a lot of people to buy they're supposedly "fresh and easy" meals. That was a major let down. I bought some mexican chicken stuff which was pretty good, and cheap, so I'll give it that.  I didn't realize they were trying to be environmentally friendly although I did notice the lack of paper bags, and only saw plastic. Maybe I was missing the paper somewhere? It didn't live up to my expectations and it's no wonder it's not doing as well in the United States as Tesco Lotus had hoped.   Honestly, Trader Joes has WAY better pre packaged, fresher items, both produce wise and for heat-up meals on the go. I'd rather just go there to pick up a meal, and skip this whole charade.  I'll try it again because there's one right around the corner from me, and I'd like to see if any of their other stuff is worth buying.

Bland, bland, bland...  They used the same spices, or combination of spices, for nearly every dish that came out- salt, pepper, sesame seeds, lemon, soy sauce, garlic butter. Rinse, lather, repeat. I don't know if I could have tasted anything more boring. We got the chicken and shrimp dish for two, which was only about $32 which I'm thankful for now. If I spent any more, I would have been really sad.  My other friend ordered the fillet with teriyaki sauce instead of the garlic sauce, and while it was decent, it definitely wasn't worth the price tag.   While the show was nice and the service good, the food was obviously overpriced and not tasty. They have a program where you sign up on their email list and get sent a $30 gift certificate during your birthday month. It's kind of sad when you go to a place and think the food is so boring that you wouldn't even come back for a free meal on your birthday.

Their espresso is absolutely the best. Every single barista that's made my latte has foamed the soy perfectly. Small, thick, creamy bubbles. I used to slang coffee, and I know. Small, thick, creamy soy bubbles. Most places don't steam it correctly, but Cartel? They're consistent and quite friendly.   Usually they've got a pretty decent selection of tunes going, and I'm happy they're not afraid to play it loud.

I'm actually pretty impressed with Blue Adobe. I have to say, after eating there at least a dozen more times, I loved it more and more. It wasn't as loud, even though it was busy. I frequently got the blue seafood enchiladas and the ancho chile rubbed salmon, both are to die for.

It doesn't make any sense how good it is and how cheap it is either. The fish is SO good!   They tend to get very busy at lunch and dinner, every day of the week. It's best to call your order ahead of time otherwise you could be waiting 20-30 minutes depending on how many people are ahead of you.   That being said, the quality the fish for the price is excellent. I'm a fish snob, I admit it. I've encountered some disgusting fish in the Valley calling itself quality sushi. It doesn't matter if it's expensive or cheap, I've seen it all.   Chopstix definitely isn't one of those places. They have great rolls. Some of the mayo sauces are a bit thick for my liking so I just order everything without it. Their miso is pretty tasty and most importantly, their sushi is $1 a piece and the sushi rice is perfect. You can't beat it for the price.

Who would have known this place has happy hour sushi if it weren't for Yelp? I wouldn't have!  It wasn't quite half off, but a good selection of their rolls and nigiri pieces are $1 off at happy hour. I went on a Wednesday at 6 PM and business was doing well. All the tables were full and people around the bar. The prices are reasonable to begin with, most of the basic rolls are about $3.50-$4.50 so $1 off I think is a great deal. The nigiri is obviously cheaper.   Great quality too and extremely friendly service. Can't wait to go back.

I ordered the Jambalaya. Not good, nope, not good at all. It really did seem like it was thickened with corn starch because it had that slightly gummy look. While it could have been something else completely, it was nonetheless odd to see Jambalaya that had that consistency.   The taste was just not flavorful, especially for the price. When I went, it was lunch time on a weekday and there wasn't any patrons in the restaurant. Throughout the entire meal, only one other couple came to eat.   Many times while eating it I thought to myself that my Jambalaya recipe I've made at home was better. When I think to myself I can make something better at home, that's not a good sign, because I'm more of a recipe follower than fly-by-the-seat-of-you-pants cook.

Man, their Pho is really addicting. I eat here about once a week, that's how much I love it. I'm impressed every time. The decor is super modern and sweet, friendly and attentive staff, and most importantly the pho makes me want to cry (good tears of course) it's that good. Every time I leave I can't wait to come back.

Gluten Free Creations is amazing. It's a bakery that makes an enormous amount of gluten free pastries, breads, doughs, buns, etc. If you are allergic or intolerant to gluten, do yourself the favor and check them out.   The gluten free bread at Sprouts supermarkets in AZ is supplied by Gluten Free Creations, which is very good. Also, the gluten free pizza dough for Picazzo's restaurants comes from this bakery.   Most importantly, GF Creations sells gluten free breadcrumbs for turkey stuffing!!!!!! Make sure to get your order in early as I'm sure they're super busy around Thanksgiving and Christmas. Two years ago was my fiance's first Thanksgiving being gluten free and we figured he'd be royally screwed in the stuffing department. Lo and behold, Gluten Free Creations came to the rescue! They sell breadcrumbs just for the occasion! The stuffing came out so good that no one eating it (including wheat eaters) could tell it was gluten free!   It's tucked away and can be hard to find. The front makes it look like a small operation but it's anything but tiny. Unfortunately most of the pastries have eggs or dairy in them so if you have multiple allergies, make sure you look at all the ingredients.   Their hamburger buns aren't all that great, kind of like 2 lb. hockey pucks if ya know what I mean but I wouldn't hold that against them. Everything else has been amazing. The staff is very helpful and you just can't go wrong if you have a gluten allergy or intolerance.

Gluten Free Creations is amazing. They have literally saved my life numerous Thanksgivings in a row for their superb gluten free bread crumbs so I could make my husband gluten free stuffing! They have provided me countless cupcakes, desserts, and tastings. They really are great. The service is fantastic and most notably-  they offer MANY multiple allergen offerings.   Since moving to CA and frequenting a few bakeries both in SF and in so cal, I've been so impressed by other business, that I'm I'm docking them a star. But not because they're not fabulous for Arizona, only because I've had mind blowing, out of this world GF, DF, and EF (egg free) doughnuts, pastries, cupcakes, and  other baked goods in California and other parts of the country.   I'm sorry Gluten Free Creations...It's not you, it's me! Thank you for all the wonderful products and service you gave for so many years. You're fabulous, and I wish you all the very best!   One thing I do have to say is that even though I live in the land of gluten-free living (San Francisco) I have yet to find a GF bakery that competes with Gluten Free Creations for offering egg-free baked goods. It's easier to make a superb tasting GF bread with egg than without, trust. Gluten Free Creations has that down, for sure.

I remember when San Tan Village opened and made the news. Apparently the "family friendly" town of Gilbert was being destroyed by the large Victoria Secret ads displayed outside their store at San Tan Village. " OH MY GOSH, my eyes! Women in bikinis!" A dozen people complained to the town calling it "Pornography." What are we living in, 1950? I just roll my eyes and laugh.   I hadn't been to the shopping center since it opened even though I live really close. I took my first trip a few weeks ago and was relatively surprised. There isn't much outdoor shopping in this area, except for the usual sprawling mega strip malls complete with Super Target, Chipotle, PetsMart et al.   The layout is nice. You can park directly in front of stores and I've found parking to be fine, even on a Friday evening.   They have the usual selections from various malls as well as some  higher end stores, and a few I've never heard of. There's a small pet store on the north east end, off the main drag that has a really cute selection of animal collars for the same prices as PetsMart, but much more adorable.   There's a Sephora, Apple Store, and Lucy, which sells yoga and athletic wear. Their selection looked nice.   I really hate the mall, with a passion. I avoid it 365 days of the year, however I love any type of outdoor shopping that's done tastefully and has a good selection of apparel, even if I don't shop all that often. It's nice to just walk around and window shop.

If you're gluten-free, Sprouts is a miracle. They label all their gluten free products right on the shelf price tag in big huge letters: "GLUTEN FREE!" You can't miss it. No fumbling through huge product packets while trying to search out the products in the store. It makes shopping for wheat allergies a million times easier.   They carry many of the same products as Whole Foods but for MUCH cheaper.  Some notables: they have cheap bulk spices, a wide array of natural beauty products, a large selection of vitamins, organic beef, wheat-free bread and baked goods (from Gluten-Free Creations bakery in Phoenix), and hmmm...what else?   The organic produce isn't too great though. It's cheaper to go to one of the local farmer's markets instead, and better quality too. Their non-organic produce isn't all that fantastic either, although it's better than your average grocery chain. I'd just rather pick up produce from local vendors when possible, so I'm somewhat biased.

I've bought ground beef from this Sprouts 3 times that has spoiled before the sell-by date!!!!!!!!!! The first 3 times I figured were flukes. The 4th time I bought their organic ground beef instead thinking it was their regular ground beef that was bad and it STILL SPOILED 2 DAYS BEFORE THE SELL BY DATE! It turned brown and smelled sour!  They accommodated me by refunding my money the first 3 times but it always was with an air of suspicion as the manager inspected the meat and always checked the receipt. I couldn't get the fourth pack of meat back to the store by the sell by date and didn't want to go through another round of questioning. Instead I just decided I will NEVER buy beef from Sprouts again!  At Trader Joe's they don't care about refunds and they sure as hell don't care if you have your receipt. They'll always refund your money with no questions or suspicious looks. Needless to say, I won't be buying meat from Sprouts EVER AGAIN!  **The only reason they get 2 stars is because I have to shop here for gluten free products because there's no Whole Foods east of Tempe...grrr**

I stumbled into this place during First Friday's one evening. I thought the staff was friendly and helpful and I especially loved my mint chocolate chip gelato. That's what I get everywhere I go, it doesn't matter what else they have. To me, no other flavor compares to mint chocolate chip.   I thought it was fantastic, nice and rich and creamy, mmm! My friend got the lemon sorbet which I tried. It was so tart it made the inside of my mouth water, and my glands feel like they were seizing up, but in a good way. I think probably anything would have tasted tart compared to my really good mint-chip heaven.

Don Matesz and Barefoot Acupuncture has been an amazing blessing to my health. Over the course of a 12 month span I progressively started getting ncreased pain in my knees.   It became so painful that I no longer could practice yoga regularly, or even modify my practice to suit my knee pain. Even yoga postures that were meant to soothe the knees hurt like no other. My knee caps were inflamed to the point that just walking hurt.   Don worked with me over the course of a few months, every week, with acupuncture and Chinese topical ointments. His clinic works on a sliding-scale with no proof of income required so patients can receive multiple treatments without breaking the bank.   After a few months, the pain in my knees completely subsided. It was such a blessing. His caring and compassionate ways are truly astounding!

The really interesting thing about this preserve is that it's in the middle of Gilbert. You'd never expect to find a nature preserve tucked between the unassuming Gilbert Public Library and track-home neighborhoods. Yet, it's there, and it's quite a gem of the east valley.   They have multiple things going on all times of the year, from guided bird watching to night-time observatory star gazing. The preserve is a little sanctuary of nature and beauty within the confines of our sprawling metropolis and I absolutely love it.   What I especially enjoy is how the Gilbert Public Library looks out to the preserve with its giant floor-to-ceiling windows. So even when it's sweltering in the dead of summer, you can still go to the preserve and enjoy the beauty while reading a book in the library.

I decided to check out Wildflower Bread Co. while perusing Changing Hands next door. I tried one of their sandwiches a couple years back and wasn't all that impressed, so I hadn't been back.   This time I had the Chicken Continental which is a grilled chicken breast, swiss cheese, marinated mushrooms, caramelized onion, romaine, tomato and honey mustard on a Ciabatta Roll. I got the half sandwich, half fruit salad for about $7.50. I guess I didn't read the menu fully because the fruit salad came with yogurt and granola on top. It was actually very good and a nice surprise, not too much yogurt. Sometimes places like to drown the fruit in it. I appreciate that they use a variety of fruit (watermelon, canteloupe, grapes, pineapple, and melon). Most places like to skimp out and just give canteloupe and melon with a couple of grapes thrown in for color.   All of it was quite tasty and more filling than I expected. I thought the bread quality was quite good and the flavors of the sandwich worked together. I went back a second time within a week because I liked the sandwich so much. Next time I'll have to branch out and try something else.

The first mistake we made was going here TOTALLY starving on a First Friday's Art Walk. To no fault of the restaurant, we wound up waiting an hour for a seat. I immediately loved the decor of the place. You could tell they put a lot of effort into making it an urban restaurant space, much like trendier dining spots in larger cities.   The service was excellent. Honestly, it was the best service I've had at any establishment in a very long time. The owner came by regularly to check if we were enjoying every dish, as well as our server.   We ordered so many dishes I can't keep them straight. I enjoyed most of them while there was a couple that stood out as not being fantastic. Personally I wasn't a fan of the Quail but any small bird with a lot of bones probably wouldn't be my favorite.   The bill was astronomical, well over $100 for 3 people without any liquor, and leaving not feeling totally full. However I knew all along it was pricey and was fine with that. I left knowing it was a great experience and I'd try it again.

I'm not one to get my nails done, ever. It's a shame because I've always wanted to. With my wedding coming up, I figured I'd get some nice fake gels so my hands would look pretty for the special day.   I went to a completely different nail place with a friend of mine to get them done originally. Much to my horror, they made my nails WAY too long and didn't file the edges. My poor fingers looked like daggers. After two days of getting them caught on everything from my clothes to nearly ripping them off as I was sliding my back door open, I decided to head to Sun Valley to see if they could fix them.   I asked how much it would be to file them down & she said it was no problem, she'd fix them for no charge. It was REALLY nice of her not to charge me, I wasn't expecting that. Not only did she file them down but she thinned them out. She was really good. As we got to talking she said she'd been doing nails for 15 years and you could tell by how precise she was.   As we were getting done, she refused to take a tip and just said to come back to her when they need to be filled. My nails are absolutely beautiful, completely natural looking, and everything I expected them to be the first time around. I should have come here to begin with, now I know.

If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. Boca 7 is like a paradise of color walking through the doors. Rich reds, blacks, and golds. You can tell the decor was well thought out and executed. Walking through the doors to see this wasn't something I expected to see in Mesa or Arizona in general. The decor alone stood out as being on par with high end restaurants you see in larger cities.   I shared the 7 course beef meal for two. The 1st course was a beef salad with a sweet vinegar type sauce and rice type crackers. The tastes and textures alone stood out as something very unique and different. The second course came with rice paper, thinly sliced beef, and an array of vegetables and herbs to create your own spring rolls. They brought out a pot of boiling vinegar liquid (it's good!) to cook the beef in. The rest of the dishes were fabulous as well.   The wait staff was extremely attentive and very nice. VERY VERY nice! They went above and beyond any restaurant I've been to in a really long time. One of the waitresses showed us how to eat and prepare everything since we were new and didn't know much. The entire experience was personable and inviting.   I ordered a Vietnamese black coffee without sugar as well. It definitely tasted french pressed and was the best coffee I've had at a restaurant. I was in heaven.   The owner came over to us multiple times throughout the meal and asked how everything was. She was so nice & you could really tell they truly gave an immense amount of attention to excellent service, decor, and presentation.   I'd highly recommend this place to everyone!!

This was my 3rd time using a moving company and  was by far leaps and bounds above the rest.   We had a custom made hand made desk that came with the house we bought. It couldn't fit through the door to be moved and thinking we'd have to leave it with the house, we called Just-In-Time to see if they could move it.Justin came and assessed the situation and said they could disassemble it, no problem and get it out for us.   The movers were prompt, friendly, and helpful. The bill came to exactly  what we were quoted and we couldn't have been happier. They even reassembled the desk. The only thing they didn't provide was bubble wrap, which I needed for a glass case. I just needed to ask for that prior to the movers getting out there and they would have brought it.

It appears that they have closed their doors for good! Check their website for more details.   Over the winter and spring I found myself here quite a bit. My friend was the general manager up until fairly recently so I'd try to come frequently. The atmosphere, food and drinks were always enjoyable. The food was always fantastic, even if a bit overpriced. They had good happy-hour appetizers and always poured a stiff martini! It's a shame to see it has closed its doors, because like someone else stated, Chandler needs more independent businesses.  It was always packed, especially on weekends. At times you couldn't even find one seat open. The decor and live jazz made it feel like you were somewhere other than Chandler, Arizona and the staff was always extremely friendly.

I decided to meet a friend here on a whim for a relaxing Friday night dinner. I was looking for a place close to my house that specifically did a sushi happy hour. I figured this establishment was a good bet based on the reviews. Not so much. I then realized when it comes to sushi in Arizona, I've been steered wrong so many times, which makes me believe most people in Arizona haven't had excellent sushi, on a coast. When you've eaten a lot of sushi, you know quality vs. crap.   The good thing was this place wasn't the worst sushi I've had, but it definitely was down there on the list. The pieces of fish were huge and disproportionate to the rice, which should be the first red flag. Sushi is small & pricey for a reason.   The fish was cut haphazardly, the nigiri was three times the size as the rice beneath it. Oh, and the weirdest thing was this strange clear gooey sauce under all the rolls AND nigiri. At first I thought I was tasting something funny with the fish but after asking the waitress, we found they put ponzu sauce on EVERY single roll and under the rice with the nigiri. Now, don't get me wrong, I like ponzu sauce, but not on everything. When I'm ordering a yellowtail roll, I don't want a gooey sweet sauce masking the flavor of the fish and rice. Maybe they were trying to mask the flavor of the fish and rice? Hmmmmm.   I ordered one of the special rolls. It was nothing special. I specifically noticed the tuna on the outside to be too firm and chewy and the spicy tuna on the inside to be way too mushy. It was all a horrible consistency.  The bill was cheap, $67 for three people and that's with about twice as much fish as we could eat. Would I go back? No. Was it the worst? No, but I'm not a fan of taking risks with sushi.

Normally I don't even go to tanning salons. However I'm going on a vacation in a few weeks where I'll be camping in harsh desert conditions. I knew having a base tan would be a good idea, just in case I accidentally missed an application of sunblock and burned.  First and foremost, this salon uses biometric thumbprint scanning to check in each and every customer in instead of keying it in on the computer. Well, I didn't want my fingerprint scanned and politely declined my first time in. So did my friend. What amazes me more than this technology is out there is that we were THE FIRST people to ever refuse our thumbs to be scanned at this business.  Now, call me crazy, but I don't willingly give up my fingerprint  to just any old business for the hell of it. Just as I don't willingly give out my social security information.   This last time in I gave the woman my name to look me up in the computer. I'd never seen her there before but I had done this the few times before and figured it wouldn't be a problem. She gave me a puzzled look and pushed over the thumb scanner and asked me to scan it. I told her "No. I don't want to scan it." and she proceeded to say  "No" back to me in apparently the tone she heard me say it. It immediately made me think, "Did she REALLY just mock me right now?? Really?" Perhaps it was jokingly but even so, it was in extremely bad taste.   She then asked why I didn't want my thumb scanned and I told her that it was a security concern. Apparently to her, this was either shocking or something she's never heard before because instead of leaving it at that, she chose to get into a) why she believes it's not a security concern and how b) the United States is going that way anyway. Apparently this is great logic.  Also, she went into how she has no problem with it and why she gives her thumbprint to the hospital to check her in. Also, how the scan isn't even identifiable or even a real fingerprint. That's fine if a person wants to have one of the most identifiable features of their body scanned, for no other reason than to have it take 5 less seconds to check in....but I do not.  And I really don't appreciate a semi rude explanation of your beliefs when all I'm trying to do is tan!  I wanted to ask her if she also gives her social security number to anyone who asks because "businesses are asking for it all the time now." But I digress...  Not only was I made to feel like I had to defend myself for not wanting to give my fingerprint (which I didn't) after it was all said and done, she only gave me 3 minutes to undress...which was either a slap in the face, a total bitch move, an accident, or just the sign of a dumb manager that doesn't know how to hit a button to give me the proper time to undress.   When my friend asked if she could give them 9 minutes to undress, she said she'd give them 8. Apparently she didn't understand that when a customer asks for a specific time, it's not a suggestion.   My first week of tanning was free but this business has left such a bad taste in my mouth that I won't be finishing out my free week. I'd rather pay full price elsewhere.

So a few days ago I got a letter in the mail from this tanning salon. It was a personalized letter from the owner apologizing for the poor service I received. He thanked me for bringing the matter to their attention. I realized they had my address on file when I signed up and they obviously figured out who I was from my Yelp review.   He has instructed his staff to give everyone 5 minutes to undress. He also mentioned I wasn't the only one to decline the thumbprint scanner. I do know that my husband was the first, or so they said, but that's besides the point. He went into the reason they have the thumbprint scanner (to avoid people using other people's packages), which I understand. In my opinion, a photo ID would work just as well, but it's not my business of course.  I was really taken aback that a business owner would go out of their way to send  a personalized letter apologizing for bad service. As a token of good will, he offered me a month of free gold-level tanning or spray tanning. Thank you!

One day I was eating food at one of my favorite Thai restaurants with my SO, and this nice couple sitting next to us starting chatting with us. The next thing you know, they brought up this place called the Good Apple Health Food store after telling them I was into alternative health and wellness, as were they.   I would have never known about this place if it weren't for them, and in fact I frequently went to breakfast just two doors down from the place on a weekly basis, yet never knew the gem hiding inside the walls.   The store is relatively small but jam packed with goodies. It's part grocery store, complete with natural foods, a great selection of gluten-free food, toiletries, beauty products, as well as supplements. We're talking walls and walls of supplements from floor to ceiling!  Everything, and I'm talking everything in the store is the cheapest I've found anywhere. The natural toothpaste I buy is $2 cheaper at the Good Apple than Sprouts. Dr. Bronner's bar soaps are about $1.50 cheaper. And if you're comparing it to Whole Foods, oh my gosh, everything is probably at least $10 cheaper. Ha. The supplements are WAY cheaper, enough so that I drive the 15 miles just to stock up on what I need. They also sell their wide selection of supplements online.   Their staff is knowledgeable and always asks if I need help upon entering.   It's located about 3 miles north of US 60 on Idaho Rd. It's far, but if you happen to live in the east valley and want good deals on natural products, it's worth the drive.

They have really outdone themselves on the space and location of the studio. The floor-to-ceiling windows in every room overlook the splendid park with ducks and geese galore. It's amazing to look out at the park while you're practicing.   I love SWIHA, and am so happy they expanded their yoga studio and moved to this location. Everything in the place has the finest of detail in mind. I go to Ann's Wednesday night class regularly, and it's fantastic. The only thing is the studios can get kind of loud at times if other classes are practicing.

Honestly, pretty gross.   The only reason I decided to eat here was getting a 50% off coupon in the mail. The meal wound up being about $6.  Even at $6, I'd rather have eaten somewhere else. I wasn't going to go near the questionalbe seafood, ie: shrimp and raw oysters. The oysters looked like rubbery bits on ice but I decided to try the shrimp because how can you f* up shrimp? Well, they didn't taste right and were rubbery. They took forever to shell. The shells kept breaking off, and honestly they smelled fishy.   I suppose if you're only into pre-made generic, faux asian fusion/buffet sub par Americanized Chinese style grossness, have fun! This is just the place!   Our waitress was really nice, and we tipped her well! Other than that, yuck!
