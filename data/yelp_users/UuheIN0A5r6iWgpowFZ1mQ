Horrible and awful are not strong enough words. I have taken my work trucks here a few times due to some groupon coupons, but never again. I took my s-10 in a couple weeks ago. They fixed the seals and said that would fix it. 2 months later I'm still going through a quarter of oil per week. Took the day off work yesterday just to get my truck fixed. Dropped it off at 8:30am. Arrogant guy behind the counter asked "what if I can't get it back to you until Monday." I told him that I'd have to go somewhere else because work starts at 6:30am Monday. He said no problem, he'd give me a call shortly. I called at 3:45 and he said he was going to look at it in the morning. I reminded him of our conversation and he said oh yeah. I then asked if they could do it now and they said no, they close in 15mins, which means I wasn't even going to get a phone call before they closed.   When I went in same arrogant guy behind the counter never apologized and said "when" I bring it back in he'll waive the $90 diagnostic fee. Give me a break, too arrogant to even apologize. DO NOT GO HERE!!!

Place always looked kinda scary. My wife and I went in on Thursday night and were pretty surprised. Ordered the sampler platter and the bar tender brought us each one which was weird. We were going to send the 2nd one back, but liked it so much we decided to just bring it home, plus the price was good. Beer was extremely cold, well poured drinks.   The bar tender seemed a little cold at first, but by the end of our stay she was very friendly and the service was great. Albeit we mostly like sports bars, we will definitely be back and it beats anything in the area.

Ok, we must have been drunk our first time there. We went back 2 more times and it was not good. The last time we were there we ordered the sampler platter that we loved the first time. The chicken was pink inside, and not slightly pink. My wife was in a panic that she'd be sick. The clientele all know each other, and you're either a regular or not, and if not, they're not friendly.

1 star is too many. We were hoping to have some good Asian food delivered and this was not the place. The delivery time was good, they got here in about 30 minutes, but it went down hill from there. We ordered for a family of 5 and it was about $70 (including tip). Everything we had was border line uneatable. The white rice was fine, but seriously, you can't screw up white rice.  The chicken was horrible, the mushu Pork (one of the favorite meals) was horrid and only came with 4 pancakes. Even the hot & sour soup was just huge chunks of tofu in some horrible broth. After the chicken and pork being so bad, figured I'd try the Mongolian beef. It was not good.

Yeah, doubt I'll be back. Been there once before, but not my favorite. It's your local dive bar with below average greasy food and in a dire need for an update, including new bar stools which is the only seating they have.

My kids grew up going to this park, it's AMAZING. We go every Christmas, and although it's packed, it's awesome. The train ride is well worth the wait during Christmas, and the rest of the year there's usually not much of a line. The prices are unbeatable. The kids love the parks and getting ice cream. I love the history, and FDR's train is pretty impressive. Do not miss this place!

About 4 years ago we enrolled our daughter in this school very apprehensively because all the buildings were manufactured housing at the time, but we'd heard good things and the school she was at was soooo bad. Well, 4 years later with 3 kids now making their way through, I must say I'm impressed. It is not easy and there is a TON of homework, but compared to the traditional schools in the area, it's not even close. The quality of education is excellent and with the exception of one 3rd grade teacher (which unfortunately we've had twice now) the educators are amazing.

My kids and I love this place. If you're looking to do Vegas, but don't want the headache or prices of the strip, it doesn't get better than the Nugget. We stay here at least once a year since they've opened the new pool. The pool is incredible. Small enough where you can actually watch you preteen kids, but incredible enough that they have fun.   We've always had good luck with the dealers. Doesn't mean we always win, but the losses aren't so bad if you have a fun and social dealer. Real drinks here, not the water downed drinks you get across the street. This is my favorite place to stay in Vegas, but I'm tired of the strip.   The downsides, no kids menu at the cafe ( I know its Vegas, but come on) and the food there is far below average, rude staff and high prices for junky cafe food. Pretty good buffet upstairs and well worth a couple bucks more. WiFi was over $10 per night which is a rip off, but there is no resort fee which I love.  If you want to spend the money and go to the strip, then stay at the Venetian, if you want to have a really good time for a weekend and actually be able to walk from casino to casino, this is your place.

Favorite Mexican food in town. Can get very busy, but they have great specials. The fundidos are awesome. Great hot chips and the salsa is clearly fresh and made daily. I love the giant shrimp they have for fajitas, salads or the fundidos. Taken many people there, no one has ever disliked it. Prices are very reasonable. Wednesday nights kids eat for a buck!

It's so unfortunate about how bad this place is, because it's so close to my house. We go in there about once a month hoping it's better and it always disappoints. The food is horrible. I've had 1/2 the items on the menu looking for something good, and there's nothing that brings me back, and what's worse, most of it needs to be avoided. They tout their burgers, and then ask you how you want it cooked, which is really funny since they cook EVERYTHING well done, no matter what you ask for. I don't mind places that cook to one temperature, but don't ask me how I want it cooked if you're not going to cook it that way. Two of the three times I had a burger I was with a friend that got one as well. I order Med-Rare, he gets Med-Well and they both come out the exact same.   The place used to have the coldest beer in the area, but even that's gone. Went there the other night because I only had 30 minutes to kill and didn't want to drive a little further to my favorite bar. I just wanted to watch the baseball game, but they wanted a cover charge because some UFC fight was on.  The waitress can be cute, but the service is poor unless you're at the bar. They have one bar tender (not sure his name, has a shaved heard) that has great service, but that's it since Megan is gone.   It's not bad enough where'd I say avoid because their happy hour prices aren't bad for drinks, but we only go there when there's no time to go anywhere else.

Wtf?? Why do I keep coming here? Ryan, bar tender is awesome, BUT, the food sucks, ownership is horrible. We are here to watch game and owner has "bi**hes and hos" blasting on juke box and reufeses to turn game audio on. Do NOT come here.

I love this place and eat here too often. They can have some long lines, but it moves quick. The employees are very frriendly. Love all the TVs that are always on sports. The subs are amazing. I get either the club or the Big Kahuna, both are awesome. They're definitely on the pricier sub, but if you want a $5 footlong with processed cold cuts and stale bread, you know where to go, if you want a good quality sandwich, Jersey Mike's is for you.

This place is awesome, so good the first night we went back the second. Amazing meatball, bread and all the food!! Our server was Jacobo, he was great!  My wife had the filet mignon two nights in a row, said it was the best steak she's ever had. I had two different pasta dishes that were incredible. We were just in rome a couple month's ago and this was better than anything I had in Italy. Albeit it's a bit on the pricey side, the food and service is absolutely worth it!

I've been here a few times for breakfast, never eating any other meals there. Very quaint restaurtant, the day we were there the waitress had her daughter following her around which was very cute.   The food is good. I've had the Arizona Burrito and Eggs Benedict both on more than one occasion. My wife loves this place. We will be back again soon.

Honesty, I thought I was walking in to a full service restaurant, so I was a bit disappointed at first, that all went a way the moment I bit into my deluxe chimi. We, it was excellent. Their hit sales has a little kick and is very good. Next time I'm on this SSE of town I will definitely stop in.

Good food, good service, just too pricey. Came in and ordered 3 apps for us, all were good and service was prompt. Patio looks awesome, just a bit too warm today, so we ate inside. Plenty of tvs, not too loud. I'll be back, but probably just during happy hour.

I love this place. Cindy is a bar tender/owner and she is incredible! Make sure you sit at the bar, just not the same place anywhere else. Love all the TV's, really good food and the owners are always there. Love the pride of ownership.   Good selection of beer and full bar. This is our favorite sports bar in town. The only reason that it's not a full 5 stars is the service can be a touch slow if you're not sitting at the bar and the tap beers could definitely be colder. Great happy hour prices too!

This place is still our favorite in town, and it's gotten even better. My wife and I went in the other night and unfortunately the bar was full so we sat in an outlying booth. Still great seats with tons of TV and staff is very accommodating to make sure they get the game you want on some where. Ownership seems to have turned most the service staff (not bar tenders which are great) over in the last few months. This is at least the 5th time we've been in there in the last couple months where we didn't sit at the bar. These new girls are great! They're attentive, extremely friendly and very cute which never hurts.   Don't miss this place, it's nothing like the dive that used to be there. Food is always good, beer is cold, staff is fun and clientele is great.

A year later and this place has only gotten better. You can now sit anywhere and get great service, food is awesome, the bar is still the best place to sit. The wings here is awesome, but I have never had anything that wasn't great. Only complaint, wish they had one more tv at the end of the bar and all the smokers make the patio unusable, but that's a problem every bar has. At least they're not inside.   Cindy and Dara are awesome and the clientele is ideal, not to many twenty something's looking to get hammered and no snooty Scottsdale types. I love this place.   My wife loves the Bingo on Fridays and trivia thurs and sat is fun as well.

I've been here twice, the first time I thought the food was bad. Went back a 2nd time because I was out there again and there is really no where else to go. Figured, "food can't be as bad as I remember." It was, maybe worse the 2nd time. Service wasn't good either. I love Mexican food, but his just is not good.

Food is aweful! Had Caesar salad, lettuce was old and dressing horrible. Chilli dog had worst chilli I've ever had. Daughter had veggie burger and when I asked how it was she said "edible." She thinks everything is great. Unfortunately, there are no good options at Circus Circus, the entire place is a dump.

I have seen  ton of shows in Vegas, and they're rarely as good as expected. When I came into the little tent and had the crappy chairs, I was concerned. The show is very odd, but it is hilarious and the acrobatics, which I'm not typically a fan of watching because they last too long in other shows, are truly amazing.   The show is very racial, politically incorrect and hilarious! Any review that says "immature" typically tells you the reviewer has a stick up their ass. It says every where if you're easily offended, do not go. The entire audience was laughing through the entire show with a number of people literally in tears laughing. Do not miss this show, I will be back in September and will be taking others to see it!

I love these types of restaurants, like Rubio's or HighTec Burrito, and they can be real hit or miss. This is the best one I've ever been in. Had to wait for a client so I popped in to grab a bite to eat. Food came out and it looked a little scarier than I though. Rice seemed to be a strange color and whole thing was in a cheap foil bowl. With great concern I took a bight of the rice and was shocked how good it was. It tasted like it was cooked in seasoning, it was awesome. Moved on to the beans and finally my Quesadilla. It was awesome. Very fresh meat, great cheese, loved it.  The place was very clean and people friendly. I hope to find one on my side of town.

Stopped by today looking for a quick bite to eat. The service was great, seems like a mom & pop shop and I love locally owned/operated businesses. Gentleman was very friendly.   I'm not a big bread fan, but ordered on wheat and it was excellent, far better than other sub shops. Food was all really fresh and prices were very good. Only complaint, he was a little light on the toppings, could have been a bit thicker.  Will definitely go again.

So bad, we didn't even get to the food. We came in and were seated quickly. We were given cheap laminated menus and as we sat there, three staff members were all arguing at the bar. We kept waiting for the waiter to come around and the arguing by STAFF kept getting louder to the point the bar tender finally came over and told them to quiet down. They quieted a bit and then we finally go some water, but no waiter yet. Then, the arguing erupted again and after a couple "F" bombs we got up and left. Thank God we did, we went right upstairs to LEVO and had the best Italian food I've ever had.

Prices are really cheap, but bad interior. Beers is warm and live band is not good. A lot older crowd than expecting for Saturday night. Average age is 50+    Didn't eat because entire appetizer menu is deep fried, but the prices were good, just wish beer was cold.
