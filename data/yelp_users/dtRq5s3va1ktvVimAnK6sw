From the outside, this place looks like it could maybe hold 2 chairs and has a much cooler name than location, but looks are deceiving! This place is as funky and cool without pretentiousness as it gets. Everyone was nice...and I mean really nice...which was amazing because I have to admit, they are all far hipper than I could ever dream of being. But that's the thing. Between the clients and the employees, the commonality is diversity. I looked great when I left. The best part...the price! They love us Yelper's. I haven't been to a place that hip, that fun, and that fabulous that didn't make an enormous dent on my pocketbook, well, ever. Plus, Topaz listened and performed just what I wanted.

I have used them on numerous occasions. Most recently, we had to put an animal to sleep and they were wonderful and compassionate, helping us make our decision. They were truly compassionate and wonderful!

I spent 5 weeks out of the country and the first place I spent money upon my return is this home away from home. It's a great location, yummy products, priced right, and a fabulous staff!

Wow! During a bi-annual allergy induced laryngitis, I went in search for my favorite tea- dry desert lime. Apparently, I am the only one in PHX who knows it because no one is carrying it this year. Next best thing? Find dried limes. This quest led me to Biaz Market. The neighborhood it is in is rough, but it's more poverty than unsafe. The parking lot, though, was full. Walking in I decided to spend some time wandering the aisles. Within 30 seconds I was blown away. They have rose water and orange blossom water for 99 cents! The only place I had found it before sells it for $4! Fresh produce, cheeses, meats. Fresh herbs that I can't find elsewhere for only 89 cents! What? Am I dreaming? An entire aisle of spices- so many that I missed my limes I originally came here for. The very, very nice employee didn't just tell me what aisle, she walked me straight to it and when I commented about a ground version, she helped me search for that. Dolmas in cans and jars for under $3 (and they're freaking delicious!). Pita bread 50 cents. So much yummy stuff priced so well. We don't often get such gems of ethnicity in Phoenix, but this hidden treasure made me feel sooooooo good on a sick day. I can't wait to go back and try the restaurant, buy more groceries and test my cooking skills, and get get my fix of the world abroad without having to buts out the bones for an international flight.

Well, when your expectations are about as low as they can be, it's easy to be pleasantly surprised. The other Two Hippies on 7th Ave in Melrose Plaza left such a bad taste that I couldn't bring myself to try this one. But eventually my longing to be on a beach in Mexico tempered with a bad economy drove me to try. It was good. Quite fun ambiance. I was glad I didn't go during a peak time because where you order is claustrophobic. But 3 tacos for $5 filled to the brim AND vegetarian options made it worth it. The biggest surprise was the free refill on the yummy fruit lemonades. $16 for 6 tacos, two lemonades (and refill), chips and salsa was a scream. As hungry as I was I couldn't finish all 3 tacos. Good stuff. The boys working were delightful!

I have eaten here twice and it is consistently excellent. I have had a shark taco, mahi mahi taco and veggie taco. I had to bribe my meat-loving-high-cholesterol-fighting mother into "splitting" the mahi mahi and veggie taco's with me. She loved them, too! The horchata is like nothing I have ever experienced. Love the fresh fruit and nuts in it. The salsa bar is a tastebud orgy of sheer delight and a playground for foodies who love complexity of flavor. But best of all... for 2 tacos, a little side of rice and beans, chips, two BIG drinks, it was only $16! Plus, we listened to The Smiths and old Mexican folk music. This place rocks. Oh, and for those reviewers who were frightened by the neighborhood, get over it. I live 5 blocks in a historic neighborhood and it is as safe as a city can get. If you come for lunch, you just might take a walk a couple blocks up to get a poleta for desert. 16th st between McDowell and Thomas has successfully embraced its roots to create a truly positive cultural experience.

I purchased a Groupon for xrays, exam and cleaning. I called to schedule my appointment and had a 6 week wait. The ONLY time available was 7 am on a monday. I would have to wait 4 more weeks if I wanted an 11:30 am appointment on a tuesday (which I work at noon so that was out). They opened the doors at 6:58. By the time they got their computers up and realized I was a new patient it was 7:05. Then I had to do paperwork. By the time I went in it was 7:15.  The xrays were awkward as the hygienist seemed to be a temporary employee, unconfidident in the equipment and techniques. My mouth was cut up by the end. In the exam the dentist recommended a deep cleaning. I wasn't surprised because I don't have insurance and hadn't been in a couple years. Apparently brushing 2-4 times a day isn't enough. That's fine. I have had it in the past, so I knew what to expect. I asked what the difference in price would be since I don't have insurance and he said an office person would be in with me shortly to go over those details. 20 minutes later, as the hygienist was moving around behind me putting things up, but not speaking to me, the woman came in to go over the paperwork. She started with the "priority" work which was not what the doc had told me was the priority. She corrected that and then showed me the deep cleaning would be two visits doing half the mouth each visit, would require numbing, and would be $420 each visit. I asked if I could go ahead and do the regular cleaning today and she said no.   I left feeling I had been in a bait and switch. I understood the need for the cleaning, but I have never had to do it in two sessions and it has never cost that much before. I was really disappointed. Perhaps if you have insurance it is a great location. However, if you don't, avoid it! I hate posting bad reviews on here and avoid it at all costs, but this was a bad enough experience that I thought others should know since they sold a lot of these groupon specials.
