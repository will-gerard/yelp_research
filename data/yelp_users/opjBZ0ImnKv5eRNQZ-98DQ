I've grown to love the Rhythm Room even though it's a little dive that's always too hot. Seems like there are always acts I'm interested in and not only is it usually pretty cheap to get in, I'm not above drinking the $1.50 cans of PBR. I'll probably end up catching a show here a couple times a month from here on out.

Update:  Croque has earned high marks with me. My office has put in detailed orders with several people, and our orders always arrive prepared well with no mistakes. The E-mail ordering make it easy. I've had salads, soup, rice bowls, and of course sandwiches and have yet to order something I didn't like.

I had a mixed experience at this Banfield, and wouldn't recommend them as your first choice for a vet due to their total lack of aftercare.  My cat had (and still has) a urinary tract infection. I took him in as soon as I noticed symptoms, and was willing to do whatever it would take to make sure he gets well again. Banfield was very nearby, and they have convenient hours, open all day on the weekend.  They booked my apointment, and got me in in a few hours. The visit started with them taking my cats vitals, then playing a video about their health insurance plans while I waited for the doctor. I figured what can you do (about the advertising), it was a weekend and they got me in quickly when I called after the vet that had been recommended to me didn't have openings for days.  The doctor examined my cat, and came up with an expensive, but necessary treatment plan. Scans to see if there were stones or blockage (fortunately no) Bloodwork to figure out if he's got kidney problems or diabetes (fortunately no), and urinalysis to determine if there's an infection (yes, elevated white blood cells detected). They convinced me to leave him there all day so that they could collect a urine sample. I wandered why they didn't just use a catheter, but went with their recommendation. When I picked him up, the doctor was very friendly, talked to me about how to take care of my cat, and how to give him the prescribed antibiotics. She said "let us know how he's doing." A sentence that feels like a lie at this point. And I dropped over $500.  On the drive home, my cat howled in pain, and when I got home I found out he had completely wet himself. When we got home he acted much sicker than when I took him in. I called them the next day and expressed my concerns about him acting sick and asked for advice about my cat not eating. The answer from the receptionist was if I'm concerned bring him back in. No consultation, no one would talk to me, just give us more money. At least that's what it felt like. The doctor wouldn't come to the phone, and the receptionist told me, and I quote, "do what you want."  Later that night my cat started improving, and was back to normal within a week. But it didn't last.  The morning before last the infection was back. So yesterday, I went into Banfield and told the receptionist "I'd like to talk to someone about possibly another round of antibiotics for my cat." Once again the doctor wouldn't talk to me. The girl at the front desk just went in then back, then came out and said "it's been a month, we'd have to see him again." It had been less than three weeks, but okay. I told her I'm pretty broke, and she just sat there with an infuriating leave me alone look on her face. I walked in wanting to talk about treatment options and looking for advice to decide what I could afford, and left so upset and frustrated with the situation that I'll never give Banfield my business again.

The pictures and video say more about this place than I could in a review. It's a great neighborhood burger joint, and I'm happy it's a short walk from home.  Everything I've had here is solid for a fast food joint. Once, around the holidays, I ordered their 10 slider deal, and ate them all myself. It was delicious but I hated myself a little after. Trust me when I say two or three are enough for one person. The chicago style dog is my standard here, they get everything right down to the steamed poppy seed bun, the fries that come with it are just average though. I also really enjoy the avocado burger, the grilled onions take it from good to great.  I always like the mix of people that go to this place. Feels like the burger joint in the town I grew up in. Last time there was a teenage couple on a date, three elderly gals out for a meal, a married couple with a kid who I might have been annoyed with if he didn't have the cutest little biker jacket with a skull on it, and some guys watching a game on the TVs.

Uncle Sam's is getting four stars from me specifically for its happy hour.  Everything here is at least as good as you'd expect from a divey pizza joint staffed by chicks in short skirts. Not my thing, but they were nice enough and I hadn't noticed until one of the guys I was there with commented. Our group was a little rowdy that night, but this is a great place for shenanigans.  The pizza? Thin crust with that low moisture mozzarella that re-melts after they cut it. You know, the kind you have to be careful with, because all the cheese will slide off your slice if you don't cut it again? In other words, delicious and exactly right for this type of place. The sides? Fried food, wings, huge sandwiches.  The (reverse) happy hour prices are what makes this place amazing. $3 pitchers of beer, smaller portions of hoagies, rings, fried mushrooms, wings, a 7" cheese pizza, all under $4 each! This may be the most awesome place in town for a weekend late night snack.

I grew up in a very hispanic part of California. I thought I knew burritos. At all of the quick serve places in my home town, burritos are 12" tortillas filled with mostly beans and maybe some other stuff. I always got the delicious little tacos.  The first carne asada burrito I got in Arizona was at this little shack in a parking lot, and it was game changing. A large tortilla so soft they had to have made it themselves, filled with sliced steak (at least 8oz, probably more, I don't know what Lisa L was talking about) with a little guac and pico. The steak was good enough that's all it needed. And the best part of the burrito was the last few messy bites, the juice from the steak pools up in the bottom.  I've had other things here. The rolled tacos, enchiladas, and quesedillas are all decent, but when you go to this place you want a burrito.

Liberty market is a great place to meet friends or family for a good, casual meal. The work that has been put into this space has payed off, and the pride the owners take in their business is evident.  I've been here four times, once for lunch and the other times for dinner. They have a good menu that has expanded from my early visits. You order and pay at the counter. The pros of counter service far outweighed the cons every time I've visited. Joining a group of friends is as simple as saying hi, placing your order at the counter, and sitting down. This style of service really shines when I attend with #evfn. Very few restaurants handle our group of 40+ with so little hassle. This makes for a great place to hang out and meet up with people.  When I had lunch here I had soup and a half size farmer's salad, the combo was on special. The minestrone hit the spot, and the salad was full of crisp, fresh vegetables. The salad and sandwich selection is good enough that I'd eat lunch here a few times a week if I lived or worked closer. For dinner the burger is my recommendation of the things I've tried. It was juicy and came with a good selection of condiments. I haven't had the opportunity to sample much of the new dinner menu. The grilled chicken pasta is pretty good, and I'm looking forward to trying the steak or the apricot glazed chicken on my next visit. I also hope to try their breakfast soon, I hear good things.  My only complaint is that the brewed tea by the soda fountain usually tastes old to me. No biggie, more reason to stick to drinks from E-61. The E-61 espresso bar makes some of the best drinks I've had in Phoenix. I can recommend the toddy, the chai tea, and the giant bowl of caffe mocha.

I wandered in here because it's across the street from the Tufesa bus station, and I had a bunch of time to kill. This place looks like it was probably a fast food chain 30 years ago, and there were a couple of positive reviews from 15 years ago up on the wall. I wasn't sure what to expect, but sometimes you can find a great dive if you're adventurous. This wasn't one of those times.  I was there at breakfast time, and ordered huevos rancheros. It got corn tortillas with fried eggs on top, and some stewed vegetables on top of that. The other side of the plate was beans. The eggs were cooked well, but there must have been half a cup of vegetable liquid all over my plate. It ruined everything. I should have complained but I was too tired to bother.

I always enjoy eating family style with a group. That's the way to do it when you visit Blue Nile. My first visit was a few days ago, and I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Luckily I went with some people that knew what to get.  We ordered a platter with some meat in the middle, and vegetarian sides around the outside. You eat by tearing off pieces of this spongy bread they serve with the food, and grabbing what you want off the tray with that. The food was simple items that were liberally spiced.   I enjoyed my experience, and would gladly return.

I'll start by saying I enjoyed the concert I saw last night, but... While it is just a music venue and my expectations weren't set that high, the marquee failed to live up to even those.  I was there with Andrew K, and agree about the fees, the line to get in, and the sticky floors. The sign of a good venue is how efficiently they handle crowds, and they fail at this. But I'd also like to talk about the bar. The servers were friendly enough, but they had tacky hand written in marker signs that read "we can only run your card once, please start a tab." When I tried to oblige, I was told their system can only handle 100 tabs so I couldn't. Ridiculous.

When I go to Mamma Mia it's for the $3.50 two slices and a small drink. Can't beat the price, and I live just a couple of blocks away. Great for a quick lunch or if I want to grab a bite on the way home from work.  I don't know what they do differently, but I prefer the pizza by the slice to the whole pies here. The slices are perfectly crispy, the whole pies are good but aren't as crisp. I've only tried one of the pastas, the Penne Vodka. It was good, but not good enough to recommend over the pizza.

This is a great place to grab some food after a night out in Scottsdale! I was at an event at Martini Ranch last week, and some of my friends wanted to grab some food after. I still don't know the area that well, so I was happy when my friend Matt C exclaimed cheesesteak! when I asked where they wanted to go.  I had a cheesesteak with american, onion, and the works. I was sober at that point, but I'd imagine if you're worried about an upset stomach you shouldn't get a sandwich with three different kinds of peppers on it. It was delicious, and I could only eat half.  Service was quick and friendly, with the authentic touch of the guy in the kitchen yelling at people calling them jackasses. It's true the steak could be cut thinner, and the bread isn't the best, but this place fills the late night grub niche well.

Unlimited is the only coffee shop in town I consider myself a regular at. It's the opposite of pretentious, has good coffee, delicious gelato, friendly service, and tbh the real reason I come here is my friends gather here on Mondays for "coworking" and shenanigans.  So the furniture is a couple couches, some four seat tables, and a big ass table with plastic chairs. Not exactly pretty, but it kicks ass that a bunch of us can show up with our laptops and comfortably work and hang out here.

I recently went to Bullhead City to spend the weekend with my sister. My mom offered to buy me a bus ticket to visit, and after seeing that the closest greyhound stop is in Kingman, I found gotobus.com and that they had a bus that stops at the casinos in Laughlin.  The northbound bus left at a pretty inconvenient time, 3:30 am. It comes up from Mexico and is subject to border delays, so it was 5 hours late. So I showed up at the station, and had 5 hours to kill in the middle of the night. Guess I should have followed the booking email's suggestion to call and see what time the bus is arriving.   The bus itself was pretty comfortable. It had high back seats that lean back, overhead storage, and they played movies. In Spanish though. The ride back home went off without a hitch however.  If you're looking for a super cheap way to get place to place, Tufesa works. If you're going to Mexico it's probably a great option. Next time I visit my sister I'll probably get one of those casino room / tour bus packages all the retirees take to Laughlin instead.

So I've always been a supercuts kind of guy. I wait almost two months until my hair is so shaggy that friends and coworkers start complaining, then go in and get it shaved off. But I won a free haircut here in a raffle, and since I'm trying to take my appearance more seriously now that I'm successfully losing weight, I was happy for the chance to shake up the routine.  I left my cut pretty much in the hands of my stylist, and she convinced my to leave some length and use a technique that has a lot of diagonal cuts. I wasn't sure about it at first, but she was totally right, it's a versatile cut, and I'm finding that it still looks great even when it's messed up.  I look forward to going back, it's totally worth it even when I have to start paying $25 a whack to go in. I'm even considering getting some highlights done next time.

I joined some friends for an afternoon of tea and conversation.  I had a 2nd flush Darjeeling and sampled the Oolong. Both were fine examples of those varieties. I was happy they carry good quality straight up teas, and the selection was large enough that there was something to make everyone in my party happy. You will find a good cup of tea here, whether you're a snob like me or not.  The biggest surprise of my visit was the PB&J sandwich. The raspberry jam was delicious, and it was on really good sourdough, grilled perfectly. I have to deduct a star for the caprese salad though.  Cheese and tomatoes are always good, but they got the details wrong. The tomatoes were served cold, there was no salt or pepper, and there was no basil.  Service was good, the two girls were friendly and knew the teas. I will happily visit again if I ever find myself at Tempe Marketplace.

This place started out as the regular place for my friends and I to gather during happy hour and get a little sauced before walking across the street to catch a movie at Arizona Center.  That's worked out so well for us that we think District whenever we need to meet up downtown. I've been there twice this week because they keep posting great specials on twitter. Monday they had a bowl of chili and beer for $5, Thursday they had a $3 cheeseburger that was killer. Watch for the specials.  Service is always friendly in a genuine way, I haven't had anything I'd say was bad, and the food is always presented beautifully. The best things I've tried so far are the po' boy sliders and the burger. I was meh about the moon pies, but they came with a shake that more than made up for it.  The restaurant validates the hotel's valet parking for three hours, so you don't need to worry about parking downtown.

Writing a review for SideBar is intimidating. All my friends love this place, and have said it all. But I have to write this and say "me too!"   I love figuring out what crazy movie they are playing, once this crazy silent film version of The Wizard of Oz had Rachel Reese and I so mesmerized that we couldn't concentrate on anything else for an hour.  I love that I know some of the bartenders, they're really friendly, and that I can just give them a look from somewhere near the bar and they know what to get me.  I usually love the pandora music. I've had several "who is this, I like it" discussions here, and have had to break out shazaam a couple times to quench my curiosity.  And what I love the most is that whenever I go here, it's with a group of really awesome people.

I met friends for brunch or dinner at Gallo Blanco probably three or four times, and I've enjoyed every visit. The atmosphere is casual and inviting, I dig the music mix, and I've never had bad service.  I'd describe the food as a decent nod to some traditional Mexican dishes, but Gallo Blanco puts their own spin on many items on the menu. I've never had guacamole with orange supremes in it, but it works, I think it's up there with the best I've ever had.   Until yesterday I'd never been able to order anything with the cochinita. Since it's always sold out my expectations were through the roof. I ordered it in a taco, and was surprised it had a sweet taste, which I decided was probably pineapple, but may just have been particularly sweet oranges since the menu doesn't list pineapple. The braising acid for cochinita is supposed to be bitter orange. I'm okay with the pork seeming like a combination of cochinita and al pastor (which does include pineapple, but is spit-grilled), it's another Gallo Blanco spin. Unfortunately in this case I prefer the originals, and agree with Fred M, you pair cochinita with pickled onions and spicy salsa, not guacamole.  I have far less to pick at with everything else I've tried. The green sauce with the Chilaquiles is delicious, it's a dish I think I'll order for brunch every time, but it's presented a bit too refined for my taste. I'd prefer for it to be drowning in the sauce. I've also had the carne asada and ahi tuna tacos, and think they were excellent.   As far as drinks, I get a margarita every time I visit. I look forward to being able to do so at happy hour prices in the near future. Also, the agua fresca my friend ordered last time I'm there looked good enough that I'll forgo the alcohol on my next visit.  I definitely recommend Gallo Blanco. They may be inauthentic, but the locally sourced, simple menu is lightyears ahead of the over-expansive, over portioned, poorly executed menus I've found at many other Mexican restaurants in Phoenix.

My meal at FnB last weekend was one of the best I've had in Arizona. I love everything about this place, the food, the cocktails, the staff, the atmosphere.  It was a rainy Sunday. I knew the restaurant was right next to Cowboy Ciao, but managed to walk right by it (my friends noticed me go by). I turned back, and Pavle was nice enough to wait at the door, and said "Ben?" as I was about to pass by again. I agree with what everyone else said here, Pavle really makes you feel at home.  I started with the slivered fennel salad and a ginhound. I split the order with a friend, and they were more than happy to bring the salad split  onto two plates for us. I love citrus, and these were a very refreshing start to my meal.   Next up was the trout. It was presented stacked on top of the sunchokes and caramelized onions, with some wonderful broth on the plate. The combination of flavors was rich, and amazing, and the presentation ensured that every bite was as good as the last. I could eat this every visit, but I sampled the chicken and lamb, and was just as blown away. For desert I had lemon cake with ice cream and strawberry compote.   FnB has been receiving a lot of positive buzz lately. It's well deserved. If you haven't visited yet, you're missing out.

I hate writing reviews that aren't glowing. But I don't think my sandwich was worth the over $7 I payed for it. There are other places in town that don't specialize in cheesesteaks that offer better. There wasn't enough cheese and the meat was dry. Service was friendly and the place is new and clean, but it felt weird ordering from what looked like a 10 year old at the register.

RnR strikes me as a casual, urban place to meet up for drinks and a bite to eat. It's not what comes to mind when I think old town Scottsdale, but places like this popping up are helping to change my mind about the area. Unfortunately after I was finished I was reminded that it's still old town when I walked by a pan flute band on Main St.  The old town parking corral is directly behind RnR, you can get to it from the alley next to RnR or off of 2nd Street.  The space has a refreshing, industrial feel. I was impressed by the thought put into the seating options. Inside mostly features traditional high top tables for four, but I noticed they had a table near the bar that could seat at least 12. The downstairs patio features another bar, and both table and lounge chair seating. The upstairs patio has the best date seating, lots of tables for two.  There was a lot of staff working during my visit. The host was friendly, and my waiter was attentive. My water was never empty and I got my sandwich in under 10 minutes. If anything they were a little too eager to please. I was both impressed and bemused when my waiter refilled my water glass, apparently noticed my ice had mostly melted, then returned with a scoop of ice to add to my cup.  I just got a grilled cheese (which includes tomato and bacon) on my visit, I had dinner plans later but I was interested in feeling this place out. I really enjoyed it. The bread is cut pretty thick, which made me a little nervous. But it had a wonderful texture, and after a few bites I decided it worked for me and didn't overpower the delicious sharp cheddar and bacon like I expected.  I look forward to returning to try other meals, and to sample what the bar has to offer. I understand RnR will have both late night hours and breakfast service. This is a great place to visit any time of day, but I'm excited about having a new, good place I can frequent after (or during) a night out.

The Duce is an interesting space with big ambitions. I'd happily visit again and again with a group of friends, but it's out of the way enough I don't see myself seeking it out on my own. There's a ton of potential for the space. If someone's involved that can put together events that make good use, Phoenix may have a new hot spot.  There are so many things going on here I'm going to have to break it up to tackle it.  - The building (five stars) It's a cool repurposed warehouse. Lots of intentionally retro touches. The different areas flow into each other. There is the food area, which is open air because the roof burned down a few years ago and they decided to keep it that way that serves food out of a 60s travel trailer, the bar that was transplanted from a rat pack era Chicago jazz club, and the retail area which has vintage clothing, novelties, will have produce, and houses the gym, an area with stadium benches and an LCD projector, the coffee shop, and the soda shop. I wonder how they plan to keep an open food area tolerable once the heat of summer sets in.  - The food (three stars, four if the prices were better) There's a brunch menu, a selection of sliders, salads, a hot dog stand, a couple dinner items, and some deserts. They're obviously going for fun and casual. I had $8 meatball sliders and liked them, the bread was good, and the tomato sauce tasted savory and homemade. The price seems a little high to consider eating them for lunch though. I discounted the hot dogs this visit, but thinking about it, I'm kicking myself for not seeing if they offer a real chicago style loaded dog, because Chicago street food staples should be the focus of the food here. I actually wish the experience was a little more "street food."  - The drinks (same as the food) They have a selection of $4 beers, fruit juices, and several cocktails served in jars. I had a spiked lemonade, and enjoyed it, though I hate paying $11 for any drink. It had decent lemon flavor and came with berries in it. If you're with a group they have a large size for almost double the price that gave two of the people I was with two glasses each. Seems like a better deal, but they way they talked their drinks had to have been more watered down (from melted ice) than mine was. They really need to offer (reverse) happy hour specials.  - The coffee (four stars) I don't know where the beans are sourced or roasted, I should have asked. But the prices were great, $1.90 for bottomless drip, I had a decent mocha for under $3. The coffee shop has a walk up window facing the street, which I thought was a nice touch.   - The retail (two stars) Not everything was done / operational in this area during my visit. As far as the what I did see, it was mostly novelty. I'm too cheap to pay over $50 for any item of vintage clothing. My friend found a neat bartender's cup with tools and cocktail recipes for $12. The gym is $5 per use, but seems like more of a novelty than even the clothes.  If you go by what Mayor Gordon and the owner Steve Rosenstein said tonight after their Chicago lovefest, I witnessed the rebirth of an old downtown scene by attending The Duce's opening night. They talked about a scene called the deuce, based in an area along Second Street that used to be a vibrant part of Phoenix. The vision is to bring that back to Phoenix by renovating the old produce warehouse district. The Duce™ (get the double reference now) is intended to be the seed of big change in the area. Time will tell if I witnessed history in the making, I certainly hope so, but I'm already seeing the typical backtalk about the owners and food (some of which I don't necessarily disagree with). Ryan C says this place is just cashing in on projected nostalgia. It's way too soon for me to be able to make that call.

I visited The Duce a second time to watch the Suns game last night, and I was super happy with everything they did. Food and drink specials, the game in HD in the food area outside, a friendly chick bringing out drinks from the bar. I appreciated that even though there were a lot of kids there they had a place to watch the game inside. They even improved the food, they grill the chicken and ribs on site now instead of just roasting them, I got the maple glazed chicken and it was delicious.

Maui Dogs is great if you're looking for a dog that's a little out of the ordinary. Get the Hawaiian toppings, and both the polish sausage and bratwurst are good, I don't think I've had a regular beef dog.  This is one of the two places with good dogs I frequent that are like a block away from me. I go here if I want something unique, they go for a mix of sweet and spice here, and it works. I recommend the sweet and spicy dog, the sunset dog, and the spam sliders Maui style. Whatever I get I usually make it a meal with tots and either red cream soda or green tea.  On my visit today they were giving away free samples of chicken wings with every meal. I liked the crispness of the skin, and once again the sauce was a nice mix of sweet and spicy. If (when) I order them in the future I'm going to ask for extra sauce though. The only thing I've had here that I wouldn't get again is a burger with chili on it. The thin chili is fine on a dog you're going to eat with a fork, not as much in a burger. Thankfully the cook was nice enough to suggest that I should get the chili on the side if I was ordering to go, so I still got home with decent food and not a soggy mess.

QQ Grill serves Japanese food quick serve style. Glad I stumbled in here, it's nice to know where I can get a good rice bowl close to home. The meal I had here today was a bright spot in an otherwise horrible day.   I stopped here for lunch while I was getting ready for a trip to Flagstaff (which got aborted due to a car disaster). I honestly wasn't sure what to expect, but when I parked I noticed a sign about a teriyaki chicken lunch special which made me happy, I was in the mood for Japanese food.   I ordered the tempura combo, which came with some tempura vegetables and a shrimp, two pieces of california roll, and teriyaki chicken over white rice. They brought the tempura out before the rest of the food, which I appreciated since tempura's best straight out of the fryer. The crust was light and not greasy. The california rolls and chicken were both exactly what you'd expect, with nice details like sesame seeds and a little chopped scallion over the chicken, but the tempura was the star of this meal.  I noticed the asian customers all appeared to be eating noodle bowls. Maybe they know something I don't, so I know I'm trying the udon and the yakisoba in the future.

This location lives up to the high standards I've come to expect from In-N-Out. I haven't found a local place that makes a great burger yet, so right now this is where I go on the rare occasions I want a burger for lunch. I always get a double double animal style, and mix the lemonade and tea to drink.
