My family and I have been coming here for years. The food is always delicious and the staff is always incredibly nice, even while we stand at the counter bickering over what we're going to get. I usually stick to the deal of the pizza, salad, and drink -- can't go wrong with that.

We went for Restaurant Week.   My boyfriend made a reservation for 5:30 and even though we arrived early, we were promptly seated right next to one of the windows. We were given not only the restaurant week menu, but the regular one and a Gluten-Free one to use as a cross-reference.   We opted to pay extra to take advantage of the salad bar and I am so glad we did. It was delicious. Fresh ingredients. All very cold - which is what I love.   I started with the spinach artichoke dip which was delicious. He had the hummus trio with fried plantains. He said the roasted pepper one was the best, closely followed by the edamame, and the original fell short with too much garlic.   He loved his prime rib and my black and blue salmon was phenomenal. I have never had such a well crafted piece of salmon. The bleu cheese butter and roasted onions brought out the flavor. The rice was meh, but who needs rice when you have salmon like that?   Dessert - he opted for the creme brulee and enjoyed it. I had the mini mud pie and thoroughly enjoyed it.   Service was fine. The manager stopped by our table to double check.   We will definitely be back.

I don't get the hype.   Everyone told me how this was the best pizza and I don't see it. I take a bite and I end up with all the cheese and I'm holding a piece of sauced bread in my hand. And that's even after it cools down.   I'll eat it though. It's close and they have GF options for my man.   Best thing are their wings.

For the record, I only remember bits and pieces about my visits to the Palo, but I can say for a matter of fact that I love this bar.   Sure, it smells a little like pee. And yeah, there isn't a patio. And, nobody is in there. But when a group of drunk friends meanders in there at midnight, it is an oasis. Rarely have we run into other groups there and when we do, instant friends! Except for the guy that just wanted to buy weed. He didn't like me much after I told him he was barking up the wrong tree.   Pool table. Jukebox. Cheap drinks. Off the beaten path.   This place may have started as a joke love, but just like so many other great romances, it has blossomed into a real and true one.

Wow.   I could eat here for days and days. Thankfully, I don't or my blood would turn into that amazing, sweet sauce that they put on that beautiful crust.   Spinato's has the best pizza in the Valley. Only better I've ever had was for $1 on a corner in New York.   They have gluten-free options. My boyfriend swears by their sandwiches, but I refuse to try them because I just love the pizza too much. We also get the cheesy GF bread sometimes and it's delicious. They can even make gluten-free food taste amazing.   Weird location, but they deliver!

My family and I came here to celebrate my wedding. For as many years as I've lived in Tempe, I can't believe I've never been to House of Tricks. We started off with the mediterranean tapas. The hummus was delicious and the pita bread was so soft. My grandfather and I each ordered the turkey club. The pasta salad was so flavorful! My brother and mother in law ordered the pastrami sandwiches and they loved them. My mom ordered the french dip sandwich. And my husband got a noodle dish which was flavored amazingly well. He is gluten-free so he was excited to have something more than just a salad. It was a delicious meal and I can't wait to return!

My boyfriend and I stopped by after hearing a lot of hype. We were let down. Very bland taste. Honestly, I would rather run through a Filibertos.

I guess I'll start with the good.  The service was excellent. The waiter was incredibly nice and we got a complimentary lettuce wrap appetizer since it had been a while since we had visited. The waiter was attentive and really nice. Even offered to get us a GF lettuce wrap for my boyfriend.   The mediocre: the food.  It was okay. I guess. You know what you're getting when you go to a PF Chang's and I must have forgotten it's just bland. My boyfriend said his fried rice was good. But how can you mess up fried rice?   And, the bad.  The floor was disgusting. It was covered in food. I watched someone clear a table and just push the food onto the floor. No one came by and swept it up. It wasn't just one part of the restaurant. There was food all over the entire floor and this is no exaggeration. It was really gross and off-putting.   There are other restaurants to go to down on Mill that are much cleaner.

My boyfriend and I were in the area and this came up as a Gluten-Free option, so we jumped at the opportunity to try something new.  When we pulled up, the line was out the door. We decided to brave it though and a manager came out and asked if we wanted breakfast or lunch. My boyfriend responded, "I'm not sure" to which the manager said, "Well, breakfast ends in a minute so here is a lunch menu." Not a problem at all. Until another party arrived behind us and when they were asked the same question, they were lead to the front of the line to enjoy the breakfast menu while we waited in line.   After waiting the longest to order the food, we sat down and shortly after, our buzzer rang and our food was ready. Well, mostly. The two milkshakes we ordered were not prepared and we had to wait additionally at the counter for them. Good thing we did because they were the best part of our meal.   My hot dog and fries were cold. So cold that I thought they had been sitting in a fridge. My boyfriend's pulled pork was also cold. And surprisingly, his coleslaw was warm. He did say that after heating up his pork at home, he enjoyed it.   A sign said if the meal was anything less than five stars, to let them know. But I was not about to hold up the line at the pick-up counter because I was unable to find an employee.   Disappointing and since we don't live in the area, we will not be back.

I usually come here for trivia. The food is actually really good. Typical bar food, but it tastes great. Prices are reasonable. Gluten-free options for the man.   Beer selection used to be better. Substantially less cider than they had a year ago.   Staff is always friendly.   Hipster crowd, but they found it before it was cool so let them stay.

What have I been missing?  My mom and I came in here for the first time a few months ago. We had the Olive Plate on special and it was delicious. We both had Rusticas - I believe she had something with eggplant (yuck) and I had the God Daughter, which was delicious. Huge portions and delicious food.  I was excited to come back and bring my boyfriend since they have gluten-free pasta and doughs for the pizzas. I brought him and the server was incredibly helpful and answered all of my boyfriend's questions regarding the GF options. My boyfriend didn't get sick and thought the food was delicious.  We'll definitely be coming back!

When I want pad Thai, this is where I go.   Always great service. Delicious food. Easy parking. What more could a girl ask for?

Craving something sweet on my cheat day and I had to consult Yelp to see what was still open at 10:30 on a Sunday night. Aloha Yogurt was right down the street and frozen yogurt would definitely satisfy my sweet tooth.   My boyfriend and I came down and were surprised to see all the options. Gluten was marked, as well as dairy-free and low fat options. Typical toppings, but the flavored were different and delicious. I stuck to chocolate and got a little bit of the pumpkin. Amazing!  Boyfriend liked his as well and we'll definitely be coming back. Great location. Great selection.

This is my favorite bar in Arizona. I've been coming here for 2 years. I love that they have Strongbow and Magners -- two delicious ciders. It has a great atmosphere.   Food hasn't been that great, but I'm excited for the upcoming changes to the menu.   Dog friendly patio too!

We came here during Comicon to grab some drinks and food. The service was amazing. Our waiter was incredibly helpful and sweet. I ordered the turkey pastrami sandwich on a pretzel bun. My husband ordered the fish tacos and said they were great. Everyone else in our group really enjoyed their food as well.  I can't wait to come back the next time we're downtown.

Gluten-free boyfriend and I come here frequently and love it. It's one of the few places we can both get breakfast in the area.  Delicious food.  Only downsides are that it is always packed and parking sucks, but that's Mill Ave.

Came for the funny name, but stayed for the good food.   Boyfriend took me here once because of the extensive GF options. We shared the Caprese as an appetizer - not bad, but even I can prepare that. He had something that he enjoyed and I had the shawarma. It was delicious.   I definitely want to come back. Any place that he can eat and I enjoy is a good place in my book.

Yeah, it's fast food. But the amount of food that they give you and it's all good.   The chicken was delicious and their sauce? Spicy and perfect. The slaw was decent. And the Texas toast was delicious. I was so full after I ate and so full of self-hate and loathing.   Can't wait to come back!

My Gluten-Free boyfriend and I first tried Snooze while in San Diego and loved it. So we were incredibly excited to learn that one opened in the Valley.   We tried to go one weekend, but the wait was too long. So, we ended up going on a Thursday. We waited a bit, but I think that's really a testament to the food.  I ordered the corned beef hash. And guys, it's real corned beef! Not out of a can, like at most places. It had a crisp to it and it was so delicious.   My boyfriend loves it because just about everything on the menu can be made gluten-free.   The waitress treated us to a pineapple upside down pancake (gluten-free) and wow. It was amazing.  I can't wait to come back here. Yes, there is a wait and I'd stay away from this place on the weekends. But make time one week day morning. You won't regret it.

Wow! The sandwiches at Ike's are amazing. When I heard about this place, I was intrigued. When I found out they had vegan cheese (hooray for the lactose intolerant crowd!), I was even more excited to try it.   Walking in, it's a little overwhelming. The menu board has tons of options and that isn't all of the possibilities.   The biggest complaint I hear about this place is the price. But the sandwiches are so delicious - you get what you pay for. Or go during Happy Hour. You get chips and a drink for free when you eat at the restaurant.  Honestly, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I cannot recommend this place enough. Got a food allergy? No problem. You're going to leave this place stuffed and happy.

Service was strange. We were told the wait would be 20 minutes even though there were many available tables. When we got our coffees from the bar (as suggested by the waitress that greeted us), we were approached to be seated. A little weird.   We sat for a while until someone finally came to get our orders. I got the Fat Hen Sandwich and my boyfriend got the Hash. My sandwich was delicious. The meat was so tender. Whatever sauce they used on the bun was a little sweet and it matched perfectly with the brisket.   My boyfriend was impressed with his hash too. Real hash! None of that canned stuff here.   We'll definitely come back.

I took my boyfriend here for his first pedicure and I was blown away. We got the Deluxe Spa Pedicure and it was amazing. The staff is very friendly and it is so clean inside. I will definitely be coming back.
