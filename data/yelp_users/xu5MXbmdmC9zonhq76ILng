Swallows and Associates was a very punctual, classy, and professional company to work with. With a two parent working household, kid's school, and all the various requirements in life Tabor and the Swallows team took a lot of guesswork and stress off of our plates. I have worked with Tabor both as a buyer and a seller now and without their team and her effort I would have had some sleepless nights. If you want not just a realtor, but a full service agency that has relationships in place with contractors for the 11th hour things that pop up on a BINSR, a consultant, and a company that has endless years of experience in the marketplace I would recommend you contact these folks.

These people will call and harass you for years on end, no exaggeration. They do not follow the law, the do not call list is ignored, and if you see a Prescott Arizona phone number calling you then I suggest the following. Set up an appointment, and have zero intention of using them. Arrange a time/date and do not show up. Do not allow them to do any work on your vehicle. Since they have terrible business practices and harass customers, set up appointments and stick it to them by never showing up. They have zero respect for our privacy or time, and the work they do is awful. I made the mistake of using their substandard industry glass and will never do so again. There are different levels of quality to the glass that is used to make windshields, and this company uses a minimum requirement by law approach rather than giving you a great product. Also, on installation you will find left over glue all over your vehicle- very poor work. Read all of these reviews, they are mostly negative reviews for a reason.  Lastly, on your cell phone their is an option to block caller. I would advise doing so you'll have many less annoying calls this way (o=
