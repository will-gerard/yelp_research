First of all, let me just say, the only reason I tried this place was b/c of the perfect yelp score. I was slightly leary b/c there was only 24 reviews(I'm #25 woo hoo! lol). But I figured getting mostly 5 stars & no less than a 4 star was given out of those 24, it must be good, & fortuneatly, I was FAR from disappointed. Just like pretty much every other review u read from here, the smoked & cured sausages & meats are TO DIE FOR! The young lady working the counter was very nice & helpfully, generously & glefully let me sample whatever i desired(which was a lot!) & they were all amazing. I got the #12 European combo sandwich, & it was hands down the Top 2 or 3 sandwich I've ever had! Very small, quaint, little, old-school type deli that u don't find too much anymore. And all the products they had were rare, look very tasty & are all reasonably priced! Great little hidden gem in NE Valley. I'm an instant fan! Can't wait to go back!

Best Pizza in the state, Hands Down! I used to eat her 2-3 times a week, for lunch. Sadly, my office relocated, so I haven't been down there, in far too long, but I'm going to change that soon, even though it is 20 + miles from my house & work now. It's well worth the drive! Amazing crust, the best, freshest sauce, cheese & toppings, & creative names & flavor combos for their specialty pies. My personaly favorites are the "Whitestone Bridge" (Garlic,  mozzarella & ricotta cheeses, olive oil & fresh basil, spinach & tomatoes) & the "Godfather" (Garlic, ham, pepperoni, salami, provolone & mozzarella cheese, pepperoncinis, olive oil & fresh basil. ).Plus, Paulie, the owner, is always there, & is a great guy. The closest thing to a real New York Pizzeria, west of the Mississippi!

Believe the Hype!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This place Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Definitley in my Top 3 BBQ I have ever had & I've been to Texas & the rest of the South! Best Pulled Pork & brisket hands down!! Also the best Mac & Cheese. Only complaint I have, is of their 4 sauces, I only loved one(Sweet & Mild), but the meat was so, tender juicy & delicious, it didn't need much sauce, if at all. Keep up the good work. I live within 5 miles, so they have a new regular customer for a long time!!!!!!!

Cool guys running the joint, have a nice convo pretty much every time I come in there, but most importantly, the Burger Brulee is seriously the GREATEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!!! And trust me, I've eaten literally THOUSANDS OF BURGERS in my life. It really does give you a Foodgasm. The flavors explode in your mouth. The Caramelized sugar on the light, fluffy brioche bun gives a dessert quality to  it, combing with the yolk of the egg & creamy Havarti, it makes it almost like a custard, but then the bacon comes in & so its like a crazy, gourmet french toast breakfast sandwich, but then you're like "wait I thought this was a burger?" And then the delicious, juicy, perfectly cooked burger patty hits your taste buds & then you hear the Angle's Harps & a warm, golden light casts over you.

First of all, let me say this is the best possible 1 star review ever. Let me expound on that. Honestly it was just one HUGE negative that brought this review from 4 stars to a measly one star. But I'll get to that in a minute. Let me tell you why I was going to give a 4 star review: The biggest reason, very nice staff. My server & the manager just kinda hung out & talked with me. Secondly, very nice atmosphere(They literally just remodeled). Thirdly(keep in mind I've only been there once & only got the 3-patty burger challenge) the burger was good, not great, but I have been told by many that their TOT CHO's (tater-tot nacho's) & their custom Mac N' Cheese are unique & to-die-for. Unfortunately, I'll will never get to try them, b/c despite all the positives I've mentioned, the ONE HUGE NEGATIVE I experienced, has caused me, out of principle, to never come here ever again. That issue: RIDICULOUS, UNDISCLOSED PRICE GOUGING. Let me explain. They have burger challenges ranging from 3-14, half LB. patties. You have to beat the champions time for each respective size & if u do, u get a picture on the wall & the burger is free. Now, their cheapest burgers are $10 & come with fries. Additional patties are $5. So,the cheapest 3 patty burger should cost $20 & come with fries. But for the challenge, you don't have to eat the fries, so in my opinion, they should knock $2 bucks off, but they don't. Mildly irritating, but no big deal. $20 for a 1 &1/2 pound gourmet cheese burger in North Scottsdale is not insane. However,  30 FREAKIN' DOLLARS, the amount of my bill is HIGHWAY ROBBERY. So how the Hell did it cost $30, when I could've ordered a BETTER BURGER(more & better toppings) WITH FRIES off of the menu for $20?. The old Switch-a-roo, that's how. First of all, they don't let you order a $10 single patty burger & add two $5 patties to it. Oh no, that would be WWWWAAAAAAYYY too logical & fair. No, you have to buy the $18 2 Patty Mammoth burger, which isn't even on the menu & all it comes w/ is cheese lettuce & tomato. Then you have to add a $5 patty to that, making it $23 before tax FOR JUST THE BURGER.I know what you're saying "But Chris, if all u got was just the burger, no drink or anything,(which was the case) after tax it would still be like $25 & change. Well now comes in the part that explains why I will never come here again. I told the manager I didn't want the lettuce & pickles. He said, no problem, you can SUBSTITUTE 2 pieces of bacon for each veggie i want to take off. Now, call me crazy, but if a Server says you can SUBSTITUTE something & don't mention an upcharge, to me that means the substitution is free. Apparently, this place didn't get the memo. Not only did they rob me of the fries AND CHARGE charge me an unexplained extra $3 dollars, they charged me another 4 FREAKIN DOLLARS FOR 4 BACON STRIPS!!!!!!!!!!!!! And in case u were wondering I did finish it, but not in time. So I had to pay $29.15 for a slightly above-average, 1& 1/2LB. cheese burger w/ 4 strips of bacon on it!!!!!!!!!! I've litterally have had $8 burgers @ Chilie's that were just as good & satisfying, b/c they came with fries. So basically, in my opinion, I was double charged, b/c they most I would have willingly paid for that burger is $15 MAX, AFTER TAX. I paid $29.15!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hence the 1 star

I would eat a shoe if you put it in their Trifecta Sauce!!! Everything was amazing, but the 2 best things I had was the Shrimp & the Hush Puppies. The Frog Legs were great too! I'll never go to Red Lobster again! When you gotta have seafood, you gotta go to Angry Crab Shack!!!!!!!!!
