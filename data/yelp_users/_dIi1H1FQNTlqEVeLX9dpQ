I was in Phoenix for a week for work. And I needed me some wings and cold beer. I happened across Four Peaks and made the comment to my colleagues that if I lived in Phoenix - and I would love to - this would be my hangout.   Plenty of outdoor seating and lots of indoor seating. Fast, friendly service and lots of good vibes in the air. But the main attraction and star of the show is of course, the beer.   I had a blonde ale and honestly could have drank about 10 of those suckers. But I was driving so alas, I had to be constrained. As it was, I knocked back 3 of those along with some wings and some beer bread appetizer that they make 2x a month.   The wings were zingy and delicious. I got half with the peanut Thai sauce and the other with the hot buffalo sauce and blue cheese dressing. And since I hate celery, got a double helping of carrots. I was not a fan of the Thai sauce at first. But once I went back to it, I loved it. I especially loved rolling the carrots in the Thai sauce. Don't know why. I just did. And the blue cheese dressing had to be homemade. Lots of blue cheese in there and nice and rich.   And it all went with the beer sooooo well. And man, that beer was perfectly chilled and so damn fresh I felt as if the beer meister (is that the word?) just got through brewing it up.   On the menu were about 10 or 12 types of beer but since it was hot and I wanted wings, I wanted a blonde ale. It went perfectly with the wings.   One more thing. I would prefer a little more sauce on those wings but I'm sure I could have asked for some. I just loved the beer so much that I didn't really give a damn about the sauce.   I go to Phoenix every year this time of the year for work. I'm already looking forward to heading out there next year for my return to Four Peaks.

Eh. Just okay. Outside bar was great but that's due to the weather. Service blows and food is just okay. Nothing special. Great for people watching though. My fave was the chic with the big boobs and mohawk.

I was out in Vegas last week for work. And since I was looking to try to eat healthier and had a hankering for oysters, the Oyster Bar at Harrah's was calling my name. And I was happy it did.   My waiter was awesome. He walked me through all of the oysters available.   What I especially liked about him was I asked which was better: the fried calimari or the Manhattan Clam Chowder, which was about 7 bucks cheaper. He said "get the chowder. You'll love it."  I did...and he was correct. It was amazing. Spicy, full of clam meat and veggies and over the top in flavor.   Then I went with the Crab Louis salad and that - as my picture states - is a work of art. An amazing amalgam of flavors and textures loaded with crab meat and avocado and greens.   Great service and outstanding food.

Crazy ass long lines and three people working. Rent from another company.  I travel fairly often for work - and vacation - and I've never understood how rental car companies staff for their customers. They have to know the reservations they have on any given day. And to not have the proper staffing to move people through in a reasonable manner just befuddles me.   Hence, my one star rating of this particular Avis. I was in kind of a hurry to get my car and hit the road and all that stood in front of me were about 10 customers and three people to take care of them. And each transaction took crazy long while people declined coverage, said no to upgrades and the counter people had to call searching for the appropriate car.   So don't use Avis in PHX. The Avis at Philadelphia Airport, however, is awesome.

Damn! This place totally rocked.   I was in AZ on business and needed a little Italian food to comfort me after 10 days on the road. NY's Best Italian Bistro was just the thing I needed.   The people working there were all smiles and took great care to make sure everything was perfect. The waitress described each special in a way that made me want to eat the air around her to capture the flavor of the words that she just bespoke.  The eggplant appetizer with a stuffing of ricotta cheese, spinach and basil was topped with a chunky, tart and mouth-exploding marinara sauce that made me utter "oh my God" in disbelief. It was amazing. And so simple.   Next up was the gluten-free penne with meatballs in a vodka sauce. Huge portion of taste that no mortal could finish. But it was a great snack the next day in my hotel room.   Wine list was good and I will definitely be back here next time I roll through Scottsdale.

This is the kind of place that exists because people like us support local businesses.   I was driving along looking for a different restaurant for breakfast when I spotted Benedict's at the intersection. My brain and stomach decided this was the spot. And once again, my instincts were correct.   This place has been around for 10 years or so in the catering realm and only a few years with the little storefront restaurant. They make everything from scratch. And while they have a very limited breakfast menu (homemade quiche, omelets, croissant sandwich, oatmeal and one or two other things) I can only tell you that the coffee cake is very good warm and the croissant sandwich rocks.   I happened to roll in when they were baking some fresh croissants. So when I learned that, I decided to wait the 15 minutes for the croissant. I sipped on some wonderful Mexican coffee that I wanted to swim in it was so good.   Finally, the sandwich was ready. Two fluffy, scrambled eggs, chefs, roasted tomato, bacon (which I had the first day and sausage the second day) and home made pesto sauce. Outstandingly crunch, fluffy and tastilicious that I honestly did not want the sandwich eating to end. But it did. And you better believe I scraped up every little bit of flaky croissant goodness that was left on the plate.   Once again, this is a place that I will return to when I come back to Phoenix next year for my week or so of work.   And if you are a local in Phoenix, get these guys to cater your affair. You'd be a superstar.

Question:  What is half the price of Nobu and 3x as good, located in the desert and an incredible value?  Answer: Harumi Sushi in downtown Phoenix!  This place truly rocks. I had three dishes:  A spicy sashimi salad A spicy yellowtail tuna nigiri A spicy soft shell crab roll with purple rice  It's hard for me to quantify the wonderful array of textures and flavors in each of the items I had. But I can assure you that the quality of their ingredients, the array of textures in each dish and the pure taste, texture and flavor phenomena is a wonderful experience.   You have to give these guys a try. Truly wonderful.
