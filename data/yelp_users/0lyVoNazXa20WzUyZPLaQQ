Ive been coming here for years and years. I have always loved the pizza, service and tiramisu! I always get the same thing but occasionally when I bring friends, they order different things and I try them. Always delicious. The cheese sticks are perfect, the garden salad (you can get get small or large, small is big enough for 2-3 people) is pretty plain but the house made italian and bleu cheese is great and then there's the pizza. I've tried a hell of a lot of pizza and this is definitely up there in the top 5. Seriously, no bullshit, just great pizza with delicious sauce and it heats up perfectly fine, too. I've had just about every server in there and service is always fantastic. Try this place, you won't be sorry.

I don't know why, but when you see a huge neon sign that says "CHEESE N STUFF", one would expect to see some friggin cheese, right? There was havarti, cheddar, brie....blah blah blah....I can pick that shiz up at Bashas. There were no specialty cheeses or meats. There were about 15 choices of sandwiches, potato salad, macaroni salad, german potato salad and chips. Thats about it. One of the deli cases actually just had chips in it. The shelves had a few boxes of little cookies from other countries but was otherwise their back stock of coke and water. 3 long community tables with fold out chairs were about all that fit in this small place. Its on its 67th anniversary and totally looks like it. Staff was nice...ish. We were the only people in there and when we walked in neither the younger lady or the older man said anything til we said Hi. Then, we got "are  you ready to order" from the younger girl. I got an italian sub with salami, mortadella and ham but it was way too much bread to meat ratio and drowned in italian dressing. My friends both got the Bismark with pastrami and roast beef and really enjoyed that sandwich. Mac salad was ok. We didn't try dessert because there were none on display. Just hand written signs everywhere telling you they had brownies and cheesecake. No reason for me to come back here.

This is the worst company to deal with. I had a mold issue in my apartment and I emailed the CEO twice and left messages with the person in charge of my building and neither ever returned my calls. I mean, this is a health issue. You would think they would want to help me! Nope! I would never as a business owner use this company and I know for sure I will never live on a property they "manage" again.

My uncle Rick is a member of this church so when my grandfather passed away, naturally, he wanted to do a memorial to Grandpa at his place of worship. I'm not a religious person but I did come here one other time with my uncle (I took a world religions class and Rick took me here). My first impression is that its such a beautiful church with symbols of various religious icons and a laid back atmosphere. The people seem to genuinely love it here and feel comfortable being in the presence of their pastor(?) Rev. Mitzi Lynton. She was well spoken, not pushy and not saying "God this and Jesus that". She told the congregation ,my family, to take a deep breath and say your own prayer for him as he was a father,husband, brother, grandfather, brother-in-law, father-in-law etc...you get the idea. I found that t o be super. They put up a few appetizers with water, tea and wine and gave our family room to mingle and greet eachother etc..The girls who helped were on top of everything! They respect one anothers  faith and belief system. I definately think i will be going back and checking out a real service. Thanks to my uncles friends who helped with everything from food, song choices, flowers and loving support.

I brought some friends from NM and they totally loved it. Corina was our server and she was awesome! This is a Friday night at 7 pm and she was super busy yet treated us like we were her only table. The chips and salsa also came with green chile, beans and sour cream sauce. So delicious. I had stuffed sopapillas with medium red chile. They were so good, with ground beef, red chile and rice and beans. I think they could've used some fresh lettuce but were fantastic nonetheless. Mom had the same with spicy green chile and absolutely ate her entire plate. My friend had a combo plate with a flauta, taco and enchilada. She loved all of it smothered in green chile. Nothing special about the margs but we really loved the food.

I've been here a bunch of times but about a year ago I started asking for Debbie. She is so sweet and she always remembers my friends order....he orders the same thing, I mix it up. Today was no different. We walked in,  got seated immediately and Debbie gets our drinks out right away and takes our order. My friends had bacon and eggs which is always good and I had a polish skillet. Everything came out fast and hot. I just love it here and the staff really looks like they enjoy their jobs!

Just great!! I loved it. The spinach salad had so many walnuts and craisins and the raspberry vinaigrette was bomb!! We also shared the ruben which was spot on!! Nice, lean pastrami, crispy kraut and russian. They dont have sourdough so the guy behind the counter suggested marble rye and some house mustard. Man, was that great!! The fries were crispy and hot....eve. though we got our stuff to go. The matzo ball soup had fantastic flavor but I didn't like the chicken. (Nothing wrong with it, I prefer white meat and it was chewy dark) . The guy behind the counter was extremely helpful and nice. I think he's the owners son because a girl came in for an interview and he called his mom right then so I'm assuming but either way...he was knowledgeable, friendly and kind to the rest of the staff, even speaking to them in Spanish. I loved it and I'll have to make up a reason to go back to north Scottsdale! Thanks!

The ONLY reason they got a star is for Lexi, the hostess. We came in on a Monday night, the host put our name in, Lexi chatted us up while we waited (he said 5 min), another family of 5 walks in, the loud ass lady claims, "I got kids, we need to be seated right away"!. Well, lady, I hate corporate places but when your family wants to eat somewhere, you gotta go so F you, wait your damn turn! The manager, Michelle, comes over, takes the wait list from Lexi and proceeds to find these people a table and then seats them before us!! I'm beside myself! I calmly explain to my family why we don't eat at corporate and we left. Felt bad for the poor hostess,  apologizing profusely because her manager sucks at her job. I hope she gets a real job at a better restaurant.

My best friends daughter is in town from Alaska and since its still so beautiful here during the day, we decided to take her to this zoo. It was soooo cool. There were many, many different exhibits and animals. The signs were informative and the price was right since we got our tickets on Groupon. (50 for all 3 of us). It was a beautiful walk and you could get super close to the animals.

I had been here many years ago and just loved it! This time I had the Chili Relleno and taco combo. So delicious. I didn't really pay attention to what everyone else had but they all loved it. Service was great, chips and salsa were always full and so were our drinks. Take a day trip to Wickenburg and go eat here!

Ordered delivery today. It was 20 min early and delicious and hot! I only got mozzarella sticks and a meatball sub but there were big meatballs, plenty of sauce and cheese. Fantastic! I've had the pizza here before as well and its thin and extremely tasty. It truly is like NY street pizza. Love it!

Ok, so I've been here a bunch but my friend had not so I had my favorite, which is the Deirdres' fried rice with jalepenos and chinese sausage. Delicious. Its a house special and a must try. We did the soft tofu and spinach dumplings. Flavorful, garlicky and very tasty. The salad with the peanut dressing is also on point. Michael had the duck and although he's never tried duck before, it wasn't his favorite thing. It wasn't that it was bad, it just wasn't something he liked but was nonetheless pleased to try something new. Creme brulee for dessert was tiny but tasty. Chana was our server and he and the busser took excellent care of us. I'll definitely go back, as far as Michael....I just don't know.

We loved everything we had. Service was great as well. We were in line for maybe 2 minutes and waited maybe 5 for our food. We had the Malibu chicken sandwich on some sort of fresh baked bread. I dont know if they make it there but if they don't, they buy it fresh everyday. The Greek salad was typical but the dressing was bomb! The star of the show for me was the soup. There were 2 choices, jalepeno hominy or chicken gumbo. We went with the gumbo and I'm telling you now, whoever makes the soup is a master soup maker! So delicious with tons of veggies, including okra, carrots and onions. Its a little tucked away in the bottom of an office building but you should find it and go there. Yum!!

I ordered delivery from here about a month ago and when I got my order, everything was cold. It took about an hour to get it and I was so pissed! I spent $25 with tip and my food was cold. So, I emailed the company and got an immediate response from Zane Rome, the area director. He apologized and credited me with a $25 gift certificate. He told me Javier was the General Manager of that location and would honor my $25 whenever I wanted to order again. Javier called and left a nice message apologizing and such. Today, I called again and they put Javier on the phone with me and I think he even brought the order himself to my house. The way they handled a bad situation was completely classy and in a day where customer service generally lacks, it was refreshing. Thank you gentlemen, my food showed up hot and fresh and I will be back.

I haven't been here in sooo long so we decided to give it a whirl since we were in the mood for steak. We arrived about 630 on a Sat night and were seated immediately in the bar, which was totally fine. We got a nice booth and our hostess (Molly) gave us a little history on the booth we were seated in. The reason we know her name was the hostess at the desk in front called her over an intercom about 15 times during our dinner "Molly...can you please come to the front"!. That was annoying while we were trying to dine and talk during our dinner. It was kind of cheesy considering the prices of their steaks. We actually thought the prices were too high for steak. The atmosphere didn't lend to the amount that was being charged. 40 dollar filet with no sides. No salad. No veggie. No.....! We decided on burgers, a ceaser salad and Mac n cheese. All were pretty darn good. I had the hickory burger with bbq, cheese and bacon. That's literally the best bacon I've ever had. My friend had the green chile burger and loved the heat of the chiles and pepperjack. Mac n cheese was delicious and creamy. The burgers come with coleslaw (deli or creamy), and we both had deli and it was very pungent and vinegary. We topped it all of with banana cream pie which was fresh and had lots of whipped cream on top. Definitely big enough to share. Our service was spot on and Keasha was efficient and friendly.  Oh yeah, you get a bread and butter plate that's pretty forgettable. They should save their money and not even serve it. We had a great overall experience and I would go back just for that bacon.

My nephew just moved to Scottsdale recently so me and a bunch of friends brought him here to show him a local bar that he and the girlfriend could come shoot pool, watch football, play volleyball etc...well....we weren't there 5minutes and 2 kids were running around the pool tables, messing up our games and screaming. I couldn't believe the staff was allowing this to happen. They were hitting the pool sticks on everything and crying when their mom attempted (in vain) to quiet them. You'd think the mom would leave at this point with her  kids....um...no....the staff did seem annoyed as well but said nothing. Then....it happened...she said " you guys better behave or mommy will be fired"!! Holy shit....she works there!! Even worse! Shame on that owner for allowing this to happen. And that employee needs to recognize this...YOU WORK AT A BAR.....not a daycare....A BAR!!!

I have eaten here for many years and just now realized that I've never reviewed it? WHAT? Ok, here's the deal. This place has great food, great management and even better service. I sit at the bar and have a great repoire with Johnny and Maryann. They have been there for years and know just about everyone who walks in that door. The owners Bob and Sally are usually present and working wherever they're needed and just the sweetest people.  I've introduced many friends to this establishment and everyone loves it. My tip is this...there's a separate menu for the bar and its awesome, the cilantro chicken on the regular menu cannot be beat and have their creme brulee. Best in Scottsdale! You're welcome.

I used to hang out here back in the day but I haven't been here in awhile. We came in here last night and had a fantastic time. Jimmy was our bartender and made a great drink and they were reasonably priced. We came in after we went painting so about 15 of us just popped in and Jimmy handled it like a champ. We didn't try the food as we'd just had a bunch of snacks but we totally had a 5 star experience. HIGHLY recommend if you're in the area.

We ordered to go on a tues night and it took 1hr and 15 min. They had a tin of orders and we were told it would be that long. That being said, it was absolutely delicious. I had the chicken luccabratzi, which is a huge pounded out chicken breast with a salad on top. K had a pasta Primavera and added chicken. It was a huge portion with a ton on fresh vegetables. He also had a ceaser salad. It was all delivered hot and fresh. We loved it. $40 including tip. Not bad! Would definitely order from them again!

Came in here on Parada del Sol to grab a quick bite. They were fairly busy but we were seated immediately. Nice atmosphere and the staff all seem very helpful to eachother. Almost like they've all been part of this team for a long time. Terence was our server and was just fantastic. He knows the menu very well and his suggestions were spot on. I had the spaghetti and meatballs, sister had Chilean sea bass with spinach ravioli and friend had chicken piccata. All of it fabulous. The bread and butter were awesome too. The salad dressings are so freaking good. I got house italian with blue cheese. Yumtown! The salad was fresh,cold and came with marinated onions of some sort. We all just loved it. The owner came over and said hi and really made us feel like we were regulars.....and I'm thinking we just might be.

We came in for lunch yesterday and I was pleasantly surprised! We ate on the rooftop patio as it was a great  outside today! Andria was our server and she recommended the Reuben. Im not a fan of rye but she swore it was delicious just the way it came and I trusted her and went for it!! She was spot on! That was one of the best Reubens I've had! Thousand island, coleslaw and swiss with a generous portion of meat. My friend had a burger and said it was awesome and the fries were cooked perfectly. There was a little cabbage salad on the plate and even that was nice. I'm planning my next trip back there for the french dip!! Service was fantastic, food was as well plus the patio bonus! Simple but great!

Came in here for lunch and they actually suggested we sit on the upper deck patio. Um...its 110 outside. Why would you even have staff up there? Food was horrible and outdated. Ive had the Reuben here and it was delicious but had the "asian" salad this time and I can't even tell you how horrible it was. Our server Tiffany was super nice but this place sucks.

By far the strangest experience Ive had at a car dealership. I had done my research, had the 5 cars I wanted to check out FROM THEIR WEBSITE, I might add, and they had lied on every single one of them. They either didn't have the advertised car, the colors were wrong or they said automatic and they were ALL stick shift. When I walked in, a young man approached me, introducing himself as the sales manager, and passed me off to another guy, who passed me off to another guy Tony. Nice enough kid but seriously listening to him explain features by saying things like, "It gots a key fob" or "it gots green paint" was a bit too much. Maybe finish high school? When I realized how unorganized this place was, I was leaving and Blake comes running out and says he can help and he'll find what I need...blah blah blah....I tell him to call me and he does explaining that I should come back down.....so I do and wouldn't you know it...he had nothing for me, no back up plan and had Tony run my credit and take my info but never left his desk to even come out and thank me for giving this mess of a company another shot. Its not worth the headache. Go to Kia on Camelback where they actually hire adults.

So, still looking for a Soul but this time Dad was in tow with an open checkbook of up to 10k. I can find a car for that for sure, right? No. We aren't even out of the car yet when Abdul walks up and we tell him what I want and ask if they have anything available in my price range. He proceeds to try to talk us into financing. Um...we just told him that we didn't want to finance. My dad is literally willing to drop 10 grand right there, that day, that moment, that second and this guy keeps asking if he is gonna co-sign for me? WTF? Hello? After 2 hours of this BS, I finally had had enough and started leaving and lo and behold....he pulled a couple cars out of his ass that fit into my budget. Not one of them was a Soul. Which is what I wanted. And told him. Numerous times. Like, just say you dont have what I want and move on. I ended up going to Precision Fleet Services and got a Soul for 9. Dad got a cashiers check, we paid for it and drove away. I couldn't be happier. Way to go Mark Kia, your BS ways just lost you 10 grand.

Ive been ordering delivery from these folks for years. Its always fast and delicious. Today we got the crab puffs which were creamy and hot. The Mongolian beef was in a tasty brown gravy-like sauce with plenty of veggies. The meat was tender but they kinda skimped on the portion. I had the lemon chicken. It was breaded chicken pieces in an awesome lemony sauce with carrots and crunchy water chestnuts. They were served with eggrolls and an extremely plain fried rice. I think I saw 1 pea in mine. Overall, I always enjoy China Wok and will continue to order from this place. Oh...1 more tip...order the house made hot mustard as opposed to the packet stuff. Wow!! Its hot!!

Ok...this place is super cool. I haven't been here forever and I stopped in 2 days in a row! I tried the arancini, which was full of flavor, beef, peas and deliciousness. I did the fettuccine alfredo and it was creamy and garlicky. Yummmm. And I did a cannoli as well. Perfection. The next day, I went back for mini cannolis for a party I was going to. They made a fresh batch and they were a hit. I cannot wait to go back and explore more of this menu. Also, the staff is all super friendly and knowledgeable.

My nephew and his girlfriend go to this location frequently and brought us in there last night for our 1st time. We were a party of 7 & were seated immediately by a super friendly hostess. The manager Tim came over to tell us our server would be right with us and he would get us drinks while we waited which I thought was great! THEN...we met Maria- She was awesome! I've been waiting tables for about 20 years and seriously....that's some of the best service I've ever had. Anyways, we tried 3 pizzas. The original cheese Sicilian, the Hawaiian and the Mamma Italia with spinach and feta etc..They were all a hit. (except for I personally didn't like the original sauce, just too sweet for me). We got the antipasto salad for the table. Tons of meats and cheeses, pepperoccinis, tomatoes, olives etc...My niece was doing her math assignment online and flagged down a young man around her age, Brad, to help her with it and he didn't even flinch, he just jumped right in to help her, (although, I think they were flirting). We tried the gelato, the chocolate chip cookies, and the apple pie crostini dessert. All very good. It was such a great experience that I'm really looking forward to my next visit.

Came in tonight with family (9 of us) and they were very accommodating and friendly. You order from the counter and they bring you the food. I can't even begin to tell you how awesome the staff is. Friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, funny and every single one of them were fantastic. The 2 guys at the counter helped my parents maneuver an unfamiliar menu, brought out our food in a timely fashion, joked with us and we just had fun. The owner came by and thanked us for coming in and chatted it up with us, telling my sister to find a husband etc...very sweet man. Ok...the food. We tried the crab puffs which we all agreed were the best we'd had, the wonton and egg drop soup came out so hot and had more than a few peas in it like most other places, the walnut shrimp was beautiful and creamy, the Mongolian beef was a favorite and the mushroom stir fry was chock full of veggies. We also did the teriyaki chicken, sauce was a little sweet but ok because it came on the side anyways. I had the lemon chicken which was a bit flavorless for me and came with broccoli, chow mein noodles, brown, white or fried rice ( your choice). The portions were huge and we took a ton home. Also, the lettuce wraps were amazing and the prices were fair for the amount of food you get.This is now our new spot and if you try it, it'll be yours too.

I went in there on the 4th with 5 other friends and had quite possibly the worst service Ive ever had there. There was a 20 minute wait so we went to the bar to wait and have a drink and an appetizer, our table came up around 15 minutes later and we asked the batender to transfer our bill ( I left him a tip on the bar) he said he couldnt transfer alcohol. What? Ive worked and still work in the industry for 20 years and have never heard of such a rule. He was probably afraid that he wouldnt get tipped.  We were hoping to be out in time for fireworks so right when we sat down my friend tells Heather, our server, that he'll have the lasagne due to the fact that he knows it takes 45 minutes. She put in the order and when she came back, we were all ready to order. 2 people ordered a salad , 1 guy got a pasta dish and the other 2 of us decided on pizza. We were told the stuffed takes an hour so we opted for the thin crust. She says "do you guys want things as they come up"? We said "No, we want to have dinner together" (Thats why we all went there TOGETHER, duh). She says she'll "time it out best she can". So, after 45 minutes pass, he gets his lasagne and nobody elses food comes up. So, we wait and wait. 20 minutes more pass and we havent seen our server, a manager, or our food. (Lasagne got cold, by the way). He gets up and goes to ask the manager where our food and/or server are and hes told " you got your food and you guys have drinks, so your good, right?" An hour and 40 minutes after we sat down, we all had food ready and asked to have it boxed so we could try to catch fireworks. (Which we missed because Heather isnt very good at "timing it out". She also obviously lacks communication because if she wouldve just came to our table and told us what happened which is obvious, she tried to time it right for us but forgot to put in the rest of the order and didnt realize it til the lasagne came up, we wouldve been fine. She avoided our table instead and the jackass of a manager didnt even try  to help the situation. He was completely unprofessional and said something to her in front of us. What a jerk! 4 out of the 6 people at that table are industry people and have been there and made the same mistake. We totally wouldve understood but the way this was handled was horrible. To boot, as we left, they said in unison..very snidely I might add... "Enjoy the rest of your 4th"....just awful business altogether!

I've been back several more times and just thought I'd update my post from a couple of years ago. We love the bellinis and go in there often to have them. We actually ate lunch there yesterday and totally enjoyed ourselves. We had wings, boom dip and deep dish pizza. Fanny was our server and was an absolute doll. So thank you Oreganos! We'll see ya soon!

Once again, Oreganos has done it. I swear, I'd eat every meal here if I was a creature of habit but alas I like to explore. We went in on Saturday and the hostess tells us since it's been so nice out, the patio server was a bit slammed but if we could give her 5-10 minutes to catch up, she'll gladly seat us there. She said we could just go to the bar and have a bellini while we waited. As a sever, I was thoroughly impressed she knew what was going on with said server and as a former manager, I was impressed that she sent us to the bar for 5 minutes. We tried tipping her but she wasn't allowed to take tips. The bartender was quite enjoyable as well. We got the garlic cheesy bread, the Oreganos favorite salad and a sausage and pepperoni pizza. Such large portions, delicious as usual and great service! Bellinis were great as well! I love it here and can't wait to go back.

We came in tonight around 530, they were pretty full but were seated right away. We sat in Jacquelines station and she got our drinks right away and Mom ordered a beet salad that was very, very good. Lots of beet strings and candied pecans. The dressing was a tad heavy and blue cheese was powerful but that salad was awesome nonetheless. I had the Delux burger with caramelized onions, cheese, arugula and perfectly cooked patty on a roll. I thought it was fantastic. We got the mixed fries on the side and it was a healthy portion with a fry sauce and ketchup on the side. Service was great, food was great....what more can you ask for? I can't believe it's my 1st time here but definitely not my last.

We had a high school reunion at Aunt Chiladas at night so the 3of my dearest high school girls and I decided to check in early. We met at Hole In The Wall and as we came in one by one from our various sides of town, there was at least a 5-7 minute wait for service PER person. We kept having to go find somebody by the pool to help us. What really was irritating was  we were at the bar! No bartender on a Sat afternoon at 3:00? The pool was open....what the hell? When we asked over and over for help, servers would just say ,"ok, ill go find someone"....none of them just stepped up and took our order. We hadn't seen eachother in about a year and now we were up and down, trying to find a server. Such BS! So we left, and vowed to never go back and I'm sure nobody cares. I know I don't.

Met the family here for lunch today and although I'm not in love with their pizza, my uncles both really liked theirs. Mom had a beet and quinoa salad and loved it! My cousin had a panini and mac n cheese, both of which he really enjoyed and I had a seasonal salad with arugula, watermelon, sunflower seeds and feta. It was seriously delish!! Here's the weird thing, my friend went to use her Fox gift card and the manager said they were no longer affiliated with FRC.....who knew?? She was very accommodating though, she was able to change the FOX card into a Sauce card so that was really nice. A server came over and checked on us a few times, refilled drinks and picked up empty plates so if you go....don't forget to tip these folks!!

We came here last night and I thought the food was awesome. Sis had a cup.of the mushroom soup and loved it and same for me with my wedding soup. We shared a cheese pizza and it was a pretty decent size for small. The crust was crispy and a little chewy. Loved it. Mom had the chicken parm which came with broccoli as well. She had plenty to take home for lunch today. Brad was our server and was a saint with the iced t. He eventually just left a carafe on the table after we had drank so much. He was very busy but very nice and we enjoyed our visit. We all cant wait to go back and try new stuff! My only complaint would be that it was sooooo tight. To the point where Brad had to reach over me and ask this young ladys date to hand her food to her. Awkward. It was also the day after Valentine's day so they, (the couple next to us), were on a date and we were practically seated at the same table. There was a little boutique with lots of cute stuff for sale but once again, we were in every servers way as we looked at the stuff because its such tight quarters. We'll definitely be back.

I was going to do 3 stars, then I remembered what great service we had and threw in the extra star. She never introduced herself so I'm going off the name on the check. "Glow" was our server and she was great. Our group of 5 was seated immediately and she pretty much just left us alone to chat it up but was there when we needed her. Fantastic! The food however wasn't that great, like I remembered. PC had the vanilla braised short rib tacos and actally said there was too much meat! Thats a 1st but she liked them. TH had the blackened chicken sandwich and liked it. JM had the mac n cheese. It was creamy and she liked it as well. I personally think it would have been better had she added the chicken or chorizo to it. Mom and I split the prime rib dip on a pretzel bun. It came out well done, soggy and barely any meat. The menu said medium rare. Glow asked how everything was and we asked if we could trade it for the turkey cranberry sandwich  instead. She immediately took it back and had a new sandwich in front of us in less than 5 minutes. It was much better but with the coleslaw on it, it was still a little soggy. The sweet potato fries were great but the dipping sauce had curry in it and that just wasn't my thing. All in all,  the food was pretty forgettable. I've been here before and remember the food being pretty fantastic so I don't know what happened. I'll definitely come back but maybe just for atmosphere and cocktails.

In an industry that is hard to find great service, we found it!! Tierza was fantastic! We were pretty hungover from Halloween and requested a mimosa, a bloody mary, an iced t and water. T brought a pitcher of iced t, a pitcher of water and our drinks out immediately! OMG, were we happy! She cracked jokes and seemed to really enjoy working here. We tried the chili with onions and cheese that was soooo good. Nice and hot and just delicious. We both got a half and half. Its a small skillet of your choice, I got the bacon and onions with no peppers, a scrambled egg white and added salsa. It comes with 2 small protein pancakes that are so good. B got a chicken, tomato and avocado skillet with the same pancakes. Food was fast and amazing. When we paid, T asked us if we wanted an iced t to go? WHAT? Hell yes! 5 stars all the way around. What a great experience. We both just loved it and will definitely return and ask for our new favorite server!

I live in Scottsdale and was on 7th St for lunch but saw this on my way and decided that I would try it on my way back. It's a very simple and cute store front and shop. There's a pretty decent selection from apple pie, s'mores, banana split to cherry cheesecake, rocky road and brown velvet (red velvet with no dye). There were quite a few more flavors. I didn't try any cookies but they were big and looked delicious. I definitely could've been talked into one and the only reason I wasn't is because the chick behind the counter had no interest in selling anything. She just looked at us, waited for us to ask questions, answered as if we should know what goes in their specialty cupcakes and then stood there. If she would have shown one iota of "give a shit" , we probably would've bought much more than 6 cupcakes but it felt awkward asking what was in the more interesting ones. There was a cupcake with pink frosting and some sort of fruit and we were told "berry". I'm not a farmer nor do I claim to be but I do happen to know there's more than 1 berry type. I'd go grab some more goodies if I were on that side of town again because they were very tasty cupcakes.

I'm blown away by my experience here. I was put on a friend's account and my friend added me online since she was out of town. She bought the phone online, paid for the service and had my old phone number transferred over. She made an appointment and all I had to do is pick up the already paid for phone! First off, they had the appointment for 8:15 when it was for 6:15. Okay, no big deal, they got me right in...Jose Felix was my CSR and I told him the deal. They had no record of this transaction so he had me call my friend to get a confirmation #. I gave him the phone number 3 times before he asked me to just write it out because he obviously can't dial and listen at the same time. This guy was such a dipshit. He then gets the confirmation and hangs up and THEN asks for her password. So, I call her again. So much for handling it online, huh? He gets the phone and I ask for the receipt, the rebate and to transfer my information to the new phone. He says he doesn't have the equipment to transfer my media, just my contacts. Um..WHAT? He ended up only getting 38 out of my hundreds of phone numbers. When I asked him why he said that's all his equipment would let him do. I just signed a 2 year contract with your company, bought a $200 phone and all you have to do is your job? Wow. By the end of all of my 30 minute experience here, I ended up asking him for a receipt 2 more times, a bag for all the stuff I bought and where was another location so I could talk to somebody that knew something about this phone and how I could get it started. If I don't have a better experience tomorrow, I'll just go back to T-Mobile. Their service sucks but at least their customer service doesn't.

I'd never been here before and since it was my nieces last night in town, we decided on Donovans tonight for our yearly splurge night. Sooooo glad we did! 1st and foremost, the 5 stars are mostly because of our service! We had Sarah and Nick (back waiter) and they were so fantastic. Sarah was helpful with the menu, personable and had a great sense of humor. We just adored her. Now for the food....we had calamari and mac n cheese as starters. The calamari was incredibly tender and the mac was delicious. For dinner, the neice had a filet and bacon wrapped scallops, I had a NY but with a peppercorn crust and the skillet potatoes and peppercorn sauce. Even the snap peas for the vegetable were awesome! My brother had a filet as well and he tried a ceaser salad, too. So good! For dessert, we had creme brulee and my niece had a choclate mousse cake. All were very good. If I had any sort of complaint, it would be the amount of times we were asked if everything was ok. 2 managers, of course Sarah, Nick, the hostess (who was a super sweet little red head girl) and the valet (who called us by name so that was cool) It wasn't super annoying or anything but our conversation was interrupted a few times. It was just a little excessive. But...thank you Donovans crew for ....well...everything. spot on!!

I called to report a crack in my windshield on Tuesday at 2 pm. It is Thursday at noon and I have a new windshield in. Travis called me 10 minutes out and was here and done in less than 30 minutes. He explained what he was going to do, told me the "rules" as he put it, and replaced it fast. He and his coworker were very nice and personable. Hopefully,  I won't need their services for awhile but I'll definitely use this company again and refer them to friends who need glass repairs. Thanks Travis!!

Their produce has gone so down hill, I just don't even want to shop here anymore. There were bumps and bruises all over the nectarines and peaches. There were about 15 ears of corn and all the husks were blackened and just unappealing. You guys need a new produce manager.

The food is great as usual but they took off the PBand J slider that was so yummy. My only complaint is the decor. The paint was chipping everywhere and the booths were ripped. l sat in a tall chair but the foot things had fallen off so my feet just dangled the whole time. This place needs a little TLC.

You have got to be kidding me. This is THE single most unprofessional place I have ever been to. We walked in and the couple before us asks to sit outside in the sun, the host proceeds to tell them he'd check with the server. Um, what? Then, as I watch a man get up from a table, the host seats us at that very table which was still dirty considering the guy just got up. Here's where I get upset....the host and server get into it as he's seating us. She yells at him for triple seating her and he's standing there, in front of the table so I can't even sit down and tells her who was staying on the floor etc....just like he wasn't in the middle of seating us. So, I say "excuse me, but can you move so I can sit down? You guys are seriously arguing while Im being seated" and the server turns to me and says in the most condescending, bitchy voice "well, we're TRYING to figure things out so we know who's going to wait on you"! I'm in this business so I had a decision right then, do I stay and run her around like crazy and then stiff this bitch or do I leave and not give this company my money. I chose the latter but rest assured KAREN....I will be emailing corporate as well. She's super lucky I had a 5 year old with me, otherwise she'd have heard some choice words follwed by an extremely loud conversation with the manager.

We sat in the bar and shared a few things. The brisket stuffed potato was delish. The bbq platter was pretty great. Fried pickles are good, although I prefer chips instead of spears. Salad was cold, crisp and the dressings (ranch &thousand) were really good. Lauren was our server and was so good. She timed everything out perfectly and was efficient and friendly. I had some watermelon iced t that was refreshing, too. We all shared the red velvet cake, which I liked but didnt think it needed the sauces underneath. So moist- overall, we had a great experience there. I'd definitely go back.

I've been back a few times and have had pretty good experiences but Monday night I went in and had such a bad experience. Pretty poor service, in fact, some of the worst I've had. It was like we weren't even there at all. We ordered drinks and it was like automatic confusion. The server who we ordered them from left and never brought them but 10 minutes later someone else asked us if we wanted drinks so we reordered and they came in another 5 minutes. Then after awhile, another person took our order and I ordered a salad 1st and specifically asked for it 1st and it never came. When our meals came, I told the 4th person we spoke to to cancel my salad. My friend ordered the corn and asked for extra butter for it. It never came so we stopped a server (#5) and asked for melted butter. He said "no problem"! But....never returned. We flagged down a female manager who apologized and went to get it. By the time my friend got butter, the corn was cold. We were there for approximately 1hr and 30 min and I got burnt ends and iced t and my friend got a tri tip sandwich and an iced t. Simply ridiculous. Never was asked about appetizers, never asked if we wanted dessert and never were we checked on during the meal. It's a good thing there are so many restaurants within a 5  miles radius because I certainly don't need to spend my hard earned money here.

Came in at 930-10 am on Wednesday and it was pretty full. We found a table and the busser immediately got us water. It took a bit for a server to get to us but we were fine and in no hurry. Mom had the eggs benedict florentine and I tasted the hollandaise which was awesome. Our other friend had the pumpkin brulee french toast (brioche, I believe ) and it came with a caramel bourbon sauce which she loved! She also had the over eady iced coffee and raved about that as well. I had the chicken and waffles. It was a nice crispy breast (boneless) and a decent sized waffle. Not anything fancy but delicious. Server was very sweet and on top of things. Overall, we enjoyed it and I'd like to try more things on that menu!

This place is great! Easy walk to and fro my apartment. The bartenders are all friendly and know how to pour a decent cocktail. There's pool,darts,golf, trivia and bowling games. Lots of good people watching as a lot of the regulars know eachother and always some good,juicy story to listen to on the patio.

I've been here a few times and could swear I've reviewed it before but alas, much like a few of my other reviews, it's no longer here. Anyways, we had 4 of us so we tried a bunch of things! I had a side salad with 1000 island, which was awesome! It had bacon, cheese, egg and carrots. Simple and great. I had the burnt ends app and it came with onion strings and homemade pickles, not too much sauce but enough. They were tender and not too fatty. Fantastic. My friends had the 2 meat plate. One with chicken tenders and brisket, she loved them and the other had pork and hot link sausage, both were fantastic. My little friend Evan had a plate of catfish fingers and he loved loved loved them. They came with green beans and broccoli (his choice of 2 sides) and sweet cornbread. But, the really great part was our service. Alyssa was really spot on. We were in a side room where she didn't have another table but we were not forgotten about, everything came out fast and hot. Our drinks were refilled promptly and the bill came when dinner was over. No flagging her down or waiting for anything. She was great and I'd ask for her next time we go. I'm not a huge fan of corporate places and the only time I really ever go is when it's somebody else's idea, but I have never had bad service or food here so I'll definitely come back. Thanks!!

My niece just got a job here so my family decided to go check it out and WOW, we were impressed! We tried the antipasti appetizer and it was so delicious! Goat cheese wrapped in prosciutto, salami, manchego and bread. Pesto, olive tepanade and mustard to dip. So good. Then we shared a few pizzas. Brussel prout and proscuitto, a margherita and pulled pork and serrano pepper. They were all fabulous!! Our service (Gwen) was great  and we really loved this place. Everyone seemed to genuinely enjoy working here which made for a nice overall experience,

I ate lunch here 2 days in a row because it was so delish!! The 1st day, Deanna was our server. We loved her! She had a great knowledge of the menu, told us specials and even helped us order. We had the goat cheese and chicken sandwich and the corn and goat cheese flatbread.   She told us to go check out the rest of the place and when we did we ran into Robert, the manager and he said right away, "welcome to our home". How cute is that?  So, I decided to bring some different friends there today. The food was awesome again...we tried a BLT flatbread and a turkey apple wrap and a veggie wrap as well. All very good! The service however wasnt exactly poor, just wasnt Deanna. We heard no specials, no name..well, no personality!  Why didnt I just ask for Deanna, you say? I did, her station was full, (shes on the patio and its gorgeous outside) and we were on a time crunch. Ill know better next time. The server actually touched the lip of the pitcher of iced-t to the lip of my glass. Now if she does that to everyones glass, well, you get the picture and I get a cold sore! YUCK! Needless to say, I asked for my tea to go. All that said, Ill come back here time and time again!!

Well, Im not really sure how to rate this. The place was small, cute and clean. There are 4 or 5 tables and about 10 bar seats and they are obviously from Chicago judging by the decor. I walked in and the lady behind the counter was ringing someone up but didn't say anything....like, have a seat anywhere, grab a menu from here or I'll be with you in a sec. Nothing. So, I sat at the only table available (dirty) and about 7 minutes later, as she was getting dessert for another table, told me she'd be with me in a moment. 3 more minutes pass and she comes over and takes my drink order. I got iced t which was amazing with hints of passion fruit and left. I then walked up to the counter and said, "can I get a cup of tomato soup while I wait for my friend"? She brings out the tortilla soup a few minutes later but my friend had arrived and said she'd eat it. I told her I'd like the tomato soup and she apologized and went to get it. No problem, we all make mistakes. Soup was delicious and definitely homemade. After a few minutes later, we told her we needed to order as my friend was on her lunch break. Oh....ok....be right there. She's literally doing paperwork or something. Its not busy at all! The other 2 tables were long gone. We ordered the patty melt with fries and the Reuben with cole slaw. Everything was pretty good. There was a guy helping her and I asked for pickles and he immediately went and got them. She comes by to bring the check without asking if we wanted dessert. So, I said that we wanted the coconut cream pie and she said, "oh, I don't have it, thats a drink". Oh, ok, well what DO you have? She's like...uh..."cheesecake and some muffins and a brownie thing" as she's dropping the check again. All of the sudden, she's in a huge hurry? I ignored the check and asked my friend if she wanted anything for dessert, as it was her bday, she said no, she had to get back to work and then I told her that I got 10% off for checking in on Yelp and she took it off and dropped the check again. I wanted to like this little neighborhood cafe so much but seriously, that server was just horrible. I asked her for a to go glass for my tea and she looked like I'd just ask her for blood. There were stacks of plastic cups behind the counter and when I pointed them out, she said oh no, I'd have to charge you for it. How stupid. News flash lady....there are about 10 breakfast/lunch restaurants in a 5 mile radius. I have absolutely no reason to ever come back here.

I always like to give a spot a second chance and I'm sometimes still disappointed and sometimes not and this time, I was not! Service was way better, even though it was the same lady as last time, and the food was great. I had lunch last time and breakfast this time so maybe that was the difference as well. The quiche, even though a small portion, was really good! I ordered a side of the breakfast potatoes as well and they were cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. Fresh fruit to boot. Pretty awesome breakfast.

We went to Dukes last night and had a great time! We ordered cheese sticks, which were delicious but a little cold in the middle, hot wings which were fantastic, meaty and classic . The ribs  pulled right off the bone and came with creamy coleslaw. The drinks were so cheap. 4.25 for a vodka cranberry and 8.50 for martinis. The bonus was team trivia. The questions were not too easy nor too hard and everyone seemed to be having fun with it. We came in 5th but in our defense, there were only 2 of us playing and all other teams had like 5 -8 people. The only complaint is that the game, the jukebox and the trivia emcee were all playing so it was hard to hear the questions. They should turn off the other stuff when trivia os on. Our bartenders were great and although they wear name tags, I forgot their names...Crow and Monique, maybe? Ran into some old friends and a good time was had by all.

A dear friend was in town and loves the Keg but doesn't have one in his town. We ordered the brie for an app and it was small but good. It came with little pieces of toast and some jelly and pesto. He had a sirloin, oscar style with asparagus,crab,scallops and bernaise. I had the short ribs. The server,Hannah, was fantastic. She mixed up my side, which wasn't her fault as I changed my mind 3different times ( mashed....no..wait, twice baked...no...regular baked...no...twice baked etc...) but she remedied the problem right away. My friend is a manager at a high end steak house in Tahoe and when he complemented her, she informed us that it was only her second week! She kept up on his coffee, which isn't easy, brought everything in a timely manner and was super friendly. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and will definitely be back.

Every time Im here, the young lady behind the counter is there and remembers me. She's always got a smile on her face and she knows the menu inside and out! She's definitely an asset to this company. That being said...I usually have the Greek chicken salad with is always amazing. Tons of chicken, bell peppers, onion, olives, feta, cucumbers and a greek dressing. I've had the mac n cheese bites with creamy gouda, so delicious. We did a chicken gyro with their homemade tzasiki sauce. It came with fries which were noce and hot and then we had the baklava. So delicious and nutty, not too sweet. If you want a diverse menu, great service and fantastic food....this is it right here.

My friend had a gift card for Sushi Roku and asked me to help him spend it and I was glad I could help! We were a little early so we sat in the bar with Regis who was super cool and outgoing. We had a couple of mojitos that were too sweet for us but still pretty good. We ate the spicy yellowtail, kobe potstickers and tempura shrimp. The yellowtail was amazing! We then got seated by a nice hostess (tall blond) and were put in Justins station. Needless to say, he was awesome! The happy hour on sundays is phenomenal. Half priced bottles of wine. So, we imbibed. My friend asked Justin a ton of questions and was borderline annoying but Justin kept his cool and treated us well. The manager, Stephen came by and was also very professional and courteous. We had the filet wrapped asparagus and the short ribs  were delicious. Overall, we had a fantastic time and would definitely return.

We ordered delivery today and it was delicious. I had the eggs Benedict scramble and some sausage and pineapple pancakes. All came in 45 min and nice and hot. My only complaint would be that there wasn't enough hollandaise sauce but I thought it was great! It was also very reasonably priced. I will definitely call again.

I usually go to Discount. I just always have but today, I was near this BigO and just needed a tire plugged up from a nail. I was met by Will and he was incredibly cool. He offered me ice cold water and said it'd be less than 30 minutes. I took the kid and walked across the street to play games at Peter piper and came back to get me car. Not only was it ready, Will did the plug for free! What a sweet gesture and by that he totally sealed the deal with me.  In a day where you no longer recieve personalized service, this was a nice change of pace and I will be going to the Scottsdale Big O for all my tire needs from now on. Thanks Will!!

Its hard to find soup when its 110 outside so we came here because the soup is always good. Im not a fan of chain restaurants but was pleasantly surprised by this OG. Mike was our server and was totally on point. We had everything in a timely manner and soup was hot and delicious. The stuffed rigatoni was enjoyed as was the sampler appetizer and of course the salad. The kids mac n cheese was a hearty portion with 2 sides. The busser (blond man bun) was so cute and helpful as well. My only complaint is the interactive tablet on the table allowed the child to just keep playing games at 1.99 per game without asking my permission. It should have a feature that makes parents allow this to happen. Mike said he'd take it off the bill so that was nice. All on all, I was impressed by the food and service at this location.

Dropped in a whim and was pleasantly surprised. We had the hummus, which was a small portion but had tzaziki, cucumbers, red peppers and crackers. Probably would have been nice with some bread, but delicious nonetheless. We shared a spinach salad with goat cheese, candied nuts and a bacon vinaigrette and a bahn mi sandwich. All very good but I noticed there wasn't a lot of pork belly on the sandwich so the bread to belly ratio was 70-30. Service was attentive and the sangria was great too. All in all...great experience.

We came in tonight for the 1st time and it was 3.5-4 star worthy but I'm saying 5 star because of our service! Ray (Rashaun, from the reciept) was so great!! Since we'd never been there, he suggested some meats and cheeses and the pretzels with provolone fondue. He explained the cheeses we weren't familiar with and recommended his favorites and which ones were crowd pleasers etc... he wasn't pushy or irritated when we decided not to have more food and just go for dessert. He was definitely what you'd want in a server and they should be glad they have him on staff. Actually, the other servers that ran our food were all very friendly as well. It seems like a well oiled machine. The only kind of weird thing was the staff didn't seem to have a defined uniform so it was kind of hard to tell who worked there but it wasn't a problem. I mean, who hasn't worn a red shirt to Target and had someone ask you where garbage bags are? If I had a complaint, it would be that the meats (we had salumi and procuitto) and cheese ( hard cheddar and soft with a truffle oil) were a bit pricey to not come with bread or crackers. It was extra and had a balsamic drizzle on it which overpowered the flavors of the cheese. The pickled peppers were forgettable but the deviled eggs were good as well as the Bourbon black bottom pie with caramel sauce and homemade whipped cream.

Listen up!! If going to the dentist scares the S%!* out of you.....if the thought of paying outrageous prices freaks you out, or if you're just plain against having your teeth worked on in ANY fashion.....please...allow me to introduce you to Dr Chari, his wife and his staff!! I've been a client for about 5 years now and I'm here to testify that you simply will not find a better group of people. From Becca and the front desk ladies who are all so efficient to Christi and the other assistants who always make you feel comfortable to Bernadette, the Dr.'s wife and partner who has always made my bi- annually teeth cleaning painless AND she always makes sure I actually get them done as well!! Then you have Dr Chari....he's just awesome. He's funny, world traveled and a family man so he's got lots of material to talk about, plenty of advice to give and is incredible at his craft. I've had veneers, implants, crowns, root canals etc...and he does them all right in the office. He's never sent me out to get any work done. If you're in the market for a dentist, call these folks...you seriously will not find a better group of people!

We decided to try something new so Papi Chulos was it. This should be 2 1/2 stars but couldn't give it 3. Too many weird things happened. So we walk in,party of 3 @10:30 a.m. The sign on the door said open for breakfast and the hours, lunch and the hours ,dinner and the hours. There wasn't a soul to be found but the door was open. We had to walk into the kitchen to find someone. Weird. The server, Jayson, told us they close from 10:30-11:00. Weird. But...they would serve us. Nice. We had to request chips n salsa. He was prompt about taking our order. Food was mediocre but hot and timely. Jayson didnt impress nor offend. I had eggs benedict. Meh..I've had better. Huevos rancheros....same. Then....the bill came. Bloody Mary's are 8.00. Ok, if its good so yeah...not ok. He brought us back the wrong change to his  benefit but we caught it so no biggie. There just wasnt anything ti bring me back. We were the only table in there and in my opinion, that speaks volumes.

After the staff was rude at Chompies and we left, we ended up here and I'm soooo glad we did!! 1st off, the 2 young men behind the counter were wonderful! They helped a ramen rookie order and got my little guy a kid friendly portion and were just so polite and cool.  The prices were low and the food was delicious.

My mom just got back from a month in Ireland so we came in tonight to catch up. I had the ravioli and spaghetti and meat sauce combo. The ravs were great but I didn't care for the meat sauce. It was very bell pepper forward and just not my thing. Oh, and we had the zucchini appetizer and it was a huge portion but I didn't care for the dill ranch that came with it. The dill just took over. Mom had the special which was a shrimp, penne, roasted red pepper, artichoke hearts and feta dish. She loved it. This would be a 3 star review because the food was decent enough but our server Pippa was so great! We really enjoyed her service and she listened to mom rant on about Ireland even though she was a bit busy. My mom left her a coin from Scotland and she was so thankful and sweet. Next time, we'd definitely ask for her. For dessert, mom had the spumoni and I had the apple bread pudding. Both were very good.

I went to a Bosa in Chandler and ordered an iced-t. I live in scottsdale so when I realized that they made me an iced t with coffee in it (total mistake, done it myself) I was driving by the McDowell store and thought I'd ask them to trade my awful drink for a regular tea. The lady explained to me that they were franchise and had nothing to do with that store. So....I explained to her that a medium iced t just cost her and every other Bosa donut,  a customer. I understand that they are owned separately but for reals, an iced t? Ideally, she should have explained the franchise thing to me, changed my drink and called the other store to inform them that their tea was bad. I will never go to any Bosa again. I did call the Chandler store and told her the tea had been mixed with coffee and she thanked me and apologized but it's just unbelievable that the asshole at the McDowell store wouldn't just give me an Iced t.

After the reunion, we decided to have breakfast together and go our separate ways. We walked in and it was a cute place. We saw some omelet station action going on too. There were 2 hosts, both very nice and we got promptly seated. Then....we waited again for 10 minutes. So, i go to the host stand and ask if we have a server? Then, it happened.....a server was sitting in the waiting area and she rolled her eyes, let out a big huff, threw her arms up and stormed away! Uh...ok....wtf was that display? She proceeded to go in the kitchen and we saw more flailing arms and huffing then our server ran right over. Grace was her name and she was very sweet. Flustered because of that other server but got our order right away. I had eggs benedict and they were delicious. I loved the savory bread pudding as a vessel. The friends had similar meals and all was right. Everyone agreed that their food was just lukewarm, too. Even the hot tea and coffee weren't that hot. It's mediocre at best.

Ok, so obviously this is a different experience because you have culinary students waiting tables so with that said, you need to remember that. They are cooks that are made to wait tables. We had Colin tonight and he was completely delighful. The ONLY things, as a server for 20 years, I would say was I wished he would've explained what we were eating. The menu tells what it is but nothing about the little extras and sauces. We had a 5 course meal for 60 bucks so no complaints there. We had.....wild mushroom ragout with goat cheese, seafood cakes (2) with a really nice sauce, no idea what it was, though. Butternut squash soup and NE clam chowder, both delicious! For the salad, we had a radicchio and asiago and some sort of fruit forward salad and again, both were super good. The scallops were in a lobster sauce of some sort and the short ribs were kinda tough but still pretty tasty with some kind of puree, some kind of gravy and a smear of mashed potatoes. There were 5 desserts to choose from but we just did the creme brulee. There was also a lady, who may be an instructor maybe,  that was super nice and checked up on us a few times. Definitely  want to come back and do this again. Its a culinary journey  that I'm glad I went on. Thanks Colin!

Came in tonight for some light eats and drinks and was not disappointed! We shared the cheese fondue which was awesome to say the least. It came with sausage, pretzel rolls, and 2 kinds of apples. Try this cheese! We had the hummus plate as well and it was also very good. We shared a Ruben which was so great. A nice pile of pastrami and a whole grain mustard and sourkraut to boot on a marble rye roll. Fries were cooked great and came out nice and hot....which we proceeded to dip in the cheese. Yum! The hummus was creamy and came with unusual veggies for hummus like radishes and snap peas and more. Totally worked. The greek yogurt sauce had a smokey flavor to it. Very good. Friends had the church potatoes and some mac n cheese that they both scarfed down so Im assuming they were great as well. I had a cucumber drink that sounded weird but was actually delicious. Other friends had a different drink with blueberries blackberries and lemonade. Both very refreshing but I thought they were kinda pricey. Service was ok. She seemed nice but not real friendly. She seemed to just drop stuff and pick stuff up. No personality. She filled my ICED T with no ice in it. Iced being the operative word here. In the end, She was nice and we had everything we needed. Im already planning a trip back.

Honey, pistachio and goat cheese ice cream in a pretzel cone. Holy smokes...get here! The cone was a bit too much for the richness of the ice cream but nonetheless delicious.

O...M....G....I was on the west side of town for a Dr appt and I saw this place. It sounded familiar to me and I remember seeing it on TV, maybe Check Please, not sure but I decided to check it out and I'm so incredibly glad I did. I took my order to go and my server Laura, was so sweet. She made recommendations and took a little time going over the menu with me. She told me the French Dip was amazing so I decided to go with that. It is delicious! Tender roast beef, medium rare, and cheese on a soft baguette. Served with crispy shoestring fries and au jus. To top off the great food and service, it was easy to get in and out of there as its right off the 101. I just turned out and was on the freeway. Check this place out....I know I'll be back!

I've been here a few times and it's always fantastic! The owner seems to be completely involved and everyone seems to really love working here. Makes for a most enjoyable experience.

So mom and I wanted to try somewhere we've never been so Morning Squeeze was it today. We walked in to be greeted with friendly hellos and prompt seating. We were sat by the open kitchen, which I love. The menu was extensive so we took a while to figure out what we wanted but we decided on the Cali eggs benedict and a fruit and nut waffle. Fanny was our server and she remembered me from her old job! I couldn't believe it! Service was great. She made great suggestions and brought our food hot, timely and delicious! No management in sight but wasn't looking for one either. Decor was beautiful. I'd definately recommend this place and I look forward to trying lunch here!

Going way downhill. There are notifications all over FB that say buy one get free lunch so...why not? We ordered a chicken waldorf salad and a black and bleu burger with a chicken breast. The chicken in the salad was awesome. In fact, everything in the salad was except for the dressing. It was a yogurt vinaigrette and was...well, pasty? Weird. I asked Amanda, our server to bring some balsamic vinegar and she brought olive oil. Other than that hiccup, our service was fine. We had full drinks and she checked on us frequently. The chicken sandwich was just gross though. Neither of us tasted any cajun on it and it was undercooked. We didnt eat it. When Amanda brought the bill, I said, oh I thought you were doing a BOGO special and she said, "yeah, If you have the card for it." I said to show me where on any of these posts say anything about a card and she couldn't. So, they took off the sandwich we didn't like anyways. I can see this place scratching to stay alive.....sad, considering at one time, this place was so awesome. On a side note, the bartender was so nice, saying hi and bye and he hopes we have a good day etc...

I called ahead and ordered a dozen wings and the girl on the other end said...do you mean 10? I said , no, i mean a dozen, which is 12. She said, 10 or 20? I was not getting why she didn't understand. So, back and forth again until she said...we have them in 10 or 20. Ohhh....well, you could've saved some time by saying that in the beginning. Anyways, i picked up my wings and they had no sauce and so i asked for sauce and she gave me a side of what looked like vomit. It looked as if the sauce broke or something. It was curdled almost. I dunno, but with another wing place right across the street, I'd tighten that situation up. Ew...just grosses me out to even think they would serve someone that.....crap.

Its really great to have ATS right by my house now! We had the vampiros al pastor, chicken tacos, chips and salsa and a bean and cheese burrito. All fabulous. Ice tea was also great. But, the thing i love about it here is the incredibly friendly service. I specifically asked her name because she was just so damn nice. She brought us mire chips without asking, checked on us a couple of times just because she was passing by and really knew the menu which was helpful to my friends that had never eaten here. So, thank you Sage. It makes a delicious meal even better when someone like you goes above and beyond.

This place is a little neighborhood gem. I'd heard great things about P&P so I was dying to it. Chip was our server and really kinda made our visit more enjoyable. He is extremely knowledgeable about this menu and he truly likes his job and it shows. His suggestions were spot on. We tried the pickles "things" which had beets,eggs, kimchi, cauliflower,pickles and carrots. Their take on tater tots is awesome, too. It changes daily, too. Ours had pepperoni and mozzarella inside and served with a spicy aioli. I had the pork shoulder tostada and my only complaint would be the ginger aioli, plus ginger in the kimchi and my Moscow mule on top of it was a bit of ginger overload but that was my fault for not realizing how much ginger stuff I had actually ordered. My friend ordered the Croque Madame with a duck egg. It wasn't the best I've had but quite delicious nonetheless. The owner stopped by and said Hi which was so cool. I've been in this biz a long time and it's the little things like that that will make this place a success. Cheers P&P....see ya soon!

This might be the most unprofessional medical company I've ever been to. I was referred by my primary because I kept complaining about foot pain. Severe.....severe foot pain. I've now been dealing with these clowns at TOCA for 3 or 4 months. It's a complete battle every time I need something, anything from them. DR. Johnsen refuses to return my call, my email and my pleas for an MRI. His staff is so incredibly unprofessional, it's like they all got their degrees at Carrington college. Suzanne, who does his scheduling is just a straight up liar. She told me she was getting my MRI approved through my insurance and after 3 weeks of no word from her, I called my insurance and they had no approval waiting. When Dr Johnsen finally got his shit together, after 5-6 calls from me and an email, he approved it for my ankle only. Something I have not even seen him for. They suck as a company and I will tell everyone who will listen not to use TOCA including my primary who refers his patients there.

I cant believe I haven't reviewed this place! I've been here numerous times and service is always stellar and tonight was no exception. I usually have Raul but occasionally I'll get Liz or Tenielle and tonight we had a new girl, Andria, and she was absolutely up to the standard. She recommended the wild mushroom quesadilla with a jalepeno ranch, which should be substituted for every sauce in your life and my friend loved it! I had the Santa Fe chicken salad and other than the cilantro IN the mixed greens, I really enjoyed it! I'm not opposed to cilantro but if I had any complaint, this would be it. I know it's mexican food but its just in everything! We had the homemade guacamole to start and both homemade salsas were great as well. There are so many things I want to try on the menu so stay tuned!!

Met a friend here for lunch today and was totally impressed! I walked in and the bartender greeted me, told me to sit wherever I want and he'd be right behind me. I chose a seat outside on the patio which was really cute, a little dirty and tables were bowed, probably because of the weather but otherwise,  I thought it was decorated nice and is dog friendly as well. There's a sign up that says "bottomless mimosas" on Sunday from 930-2. Nice! I ordered an iced-t (hibiscus) and a hummus platter while I waited. Another man came by and brought me water and asked if I'd been taken care of, (love that) and I told him I had. Our server was Nathan and he was awesome! We never needed anything and everything was fantastic. We shared the golden beet salad and the brie hive sandwich and they were both delicious. The sandwich was on toasted bread with arugula, brie, apples and prosciutto and came with their specialty fries in some kind of sauce but remained crispy. The salad had almonds,raisins, beets and an arugula spinach mix. Nathan split them both for us, too. We really enjoyed the service and food and definitely will be back!

Wow! Just fantastic. Picture this....its 10 am in what is about to become a 115° day in Phx and we walk in and they say immediate seating on the patio. The niece and I look at each other but our hunger takes over and we agree to go for it. We're approached by Joe, who cracks a joke about her ordering a cappuccino but she hasn't had her coffee yet so she does not care that it's gonna be a scorcher today. He helps us navigate the menu and we ordered the pancake flight which we had about 6 choices (you get 3) and we chose pineapple upside down cake with a creme anglaise, sweet potato with brown butter butter and the daily special which was like a smoothie kind of flavor on a white chocolate pancake. Yum!! We also shared the hash browns with cheese and 2 choices of meats, sauces or veggies. We got onions, bacon and spinach (.75). Plenty to share. 2 drinks later and 31 bucks. Totally reasonable and absolutely delicious. Top all that off with Joe's amazing service and you have a recipe for "Im going back"!

We came in on a Saturday afternoon around 130-2 . It was very busy but we were seated right away on the patio. There were 2  different games on right next to eachother and the volume on both were up and very loud. It was extremely hard to hear eachother talk as well as annoying.  Our server was Nadine and she was very sweet and very proficient. We had the buffalo dip which was delicious. It could've used a creamy element of some sort but was nice and spicy and served with homemade chips. I had the juicy Lucy on a pretzel bun. It was awesome! I got the sweet potato tots with it and they came out black. I'm not kidding. I asked the food runner if this is what they were supposed to look like and he said..."they're a bit crispy but still good. I actually prefer them that way". I personally would have never served those. Nadine took 1 look at them and went and got me new ones. My friend ordered the 1000 island burger medium rare and although it came out mid well, he still enjoyed it. He also said the cole slaw was great. My other friend had a build your own burger with a side salad and liked it just fine. So, other than the noise level and tater tot issue, we thoroughly enjoyed our service and overall experience here.

9 of us went in this afternoon to watch the Blackhawks game. 1st and foremost, Bret was our server and was fantastic! There were people everywhere! She handled it so well. Seriously,  kudos to that girl because that place was packed. For food,  I had the CBCB burger and it was so tasty. My roomie had the prime rib dip and loved it! Her bf had the down south dog and loved it as well. We shared buffalo eggrolls and wings which were meaty and perfectly sauced. My only complaint would be this....we sat by the kitchen and there was a group of guys literally standing by the "out" door and clearly in the way and the 1 manager I saw on duty did nothing about it. Food runners, servers, bussers etc...had to weave in and out of eachothers way because these idiots didn't realize or care that they were messing with the flow of a busy restaurant and this manager just chatted it up with these guys. They're friends of his, I'm guessing, because they were ALL completely unaware of the fact that they were so incredibly in the way. I guess hearing "excuse me" 6,000 times isn't a clue.

As usual, this place was awesome. Brianna was our server and was fantastic! We tried the hummus, which came with 2 types, regular and cilantro. I didnt care for the cilantro one but thats just my taste. Not a huge fan of it. It came with a ton of fresh veggies and warm pita bread. My friend did the buffalo chicken egg rolls. Egg roll wrappers stuffed with buffalo chicken and fried and topped off with bleu cheese. Yum!! She also had the CBCB burger with sweet potato tots. She ate it all so I assume it was great! I had the turkey burger, at Briannas suggestion, 1000 island style. It was cheesy and the lettuce was fresh and crisp. I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor of the turkey but once again, its just my taste. I got the fruit with it and there was a melange of various fruits. We always have great food and service here. Check it out for Blackhawks games as well!

Horrible. Horrible food and horrible service. Man, this place has gone way downhill. I made a reservation Sunday night for 14 of us on Tuesday for my nephews b-day. The hostess had to put me on hold to ask a manager if it was ok. Um...ok? Mgr was super nice and penciled us in. I got a call on Monday AND Tuesday to confirm my reservation...ok. no biggie. We get there and there's literally 2 other tables in the whole place. I didnt catch the servers name but she had a very unique style of serving. She kept asking us if she could "snag an order". Like any other restaurant, we wanted appetizers first, then our entrees to come out together. Nope, not this place. Our apps came out sporadically and my uncle got his app as his entree because she never came back to snag his order. He was fine with that as all the plates were decently sized and we shared. My nephew and his girlfriend got their food before my side of the table even ordered. WTF? When I pointed this out to her that we all came in together and wanted to eat together....ya know, like normal, she apologized, which was nice but we were all eating different things at different times and it was just weird. The 4 of us at the end were still eating while my nephew opened gifts and ate dessert. Lame. Everyone pretty much enjoyed what they got except the pad thai was gross. The chicken seemed undercooked a bit and I asked for no cilantro which apparently means extra cilantro but no peanuts. I traded it for the spicy chicken and that was decent. Overall, I will not be back and this is again why people should support locally owned businesses and stay away from corporate.

Ive been eating here for years! Its great thin crust pizza and they have daily specials. I ordered a 16 inch with Gardiner and a side of garlic bread for 15 bucks! Delivery can sometimes a bit slow but its probably because they're busy. My pizza and bread came hot and fast today and delicious!

This place was great!! We just walked in at 630 tonight and had to wait 15 minutes,  no big deal. The darling hostess told us when there was a table available and she just needed to clean it which was a nice heads up. We got a nice booth, great atmosphere etc... our server Nicholas came over promptly and got us a bottle of Sardo (delicious)  and the grilled artichoke and hummus platter. This is where the lost 5th star comes in. The hummus plate is served with 2 scoops of hummus, garlic oil, tzaziki, fried garbanzo beans,  carrots, peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers and 4 strips of bread. Like 1 piece in 4 strips. They charge of you ask for 4 more skinny little strips. (which we did twice). There was just so much to dip, but no bread. Bread doesnt cost that much, serve a basket with that particular app. To charge $1 is almost insulting, like neither of us, the owner nor me and my friends could afford it. The artichoke was still a bit hard but tasty nonetheless. Lemon aioli was spot on. Not too lemony. Now...the pizza was fantastic. Nice crunch to chewy dough ratio. We got a Divola (sp) with spicy soprassata and a red sauce and a white pizza with fontina and sausage on it. Both were just divine!! We all loved them so much. For dessert, we had a fruity pebble cake thing. Not the best thing I've ever had but certainly not the worst. The overall experience was great. We had good company, great food and wonderful service. Thanks guys, we'll for sure be back!

This place was just fantastic. My friends were running a little late so I sat at the bar for a few with Will. He was very friendly, kinda goofy but totally knowledgeable about the drinks. Tons and tons of whiskeys! I had a vodka soda. Lol! We were seated with Terrance and he was also very knowledgeable about the menu, made some awesome suggestions and we loved everything we had which was....scallops with the most delicious corn grits ever! They were topped with pea tendrils which were chewy but really tasted like peas! Weird. I had the short ribs with a blueberry compote but chose the smashed yukon potatoes instead of whatever it came with. Amazing. Juicy, tender and portioned perfectly! The filet was cooked a perfect medium rare and came with the mashed yukons as well. For dessert....banana cream pot with a peanut butter crumble and the chocolate flourless cake with mint chip ice cream. Wow. Delicious. The mint chip ice cream tasted so fresh. I might add that we told Terrance of my friends tree nut allergy and he told us the cake was made with almond flour but the banana pot was fine. You usually don't find servers that know these things.  The food and service, including the busser, who kept our water full all night,  were absolutely superb. We can't wait to go back!

Last time I was here, it was a strange experience. I dont even remember what I had. I just remember not being impressed enough to Yelp. Weird service, dirty tables...things like that. Fast forward about a year...wanted a patio and decided to try this little spot. Im happy we did. Service was fantastic, food was phenomenal and the place is cleaned up and adorable!  I had the monte cristo sandwich on french toast. Just delicious and filling. Nice portion for 11 bucks. We also tried the pesto omelet, stuffed with veggies and cheese, their homemade potatoes were bomb and the regular french toast is made of angels wings, I think. Absolutely delicious.Being a little cafe next to Cornish Pasty can't be easy but Cafe Alo seems to be holding their own. Awesome!!

This was the 2nd time I've been here and both were great experiences. Customer service was fantastic, the staff seems to like their jobs and the burger was great. My only complaint is the Cobb salad was pretty plain, meaning there were a few ingredients on it but small amounts. Otherwise, this place was.pretty darn good!

What a great little spot! You can sit out on the patio and eat a delicious meal amongst an awesome collection of birds! Some of them talk as well. They were pretty busy this afternoon so the bartender came out from behind the bar and up on the patio to take care of us. She was super friendly and as a first timer, she guided me through the menu and helped us with our order. We had the meat and cheese board which isnt worth $25 but is half off today (Wed) and was definitely worth that. Hummus was hummus but very good. Fresh veggies and pita pieces were on the side of the hummus. The boys got pretzel bites and a kid burger which was a slider and the smoked gouda mac n cheese. It was such a beautiful day out to sit on the patio and we totally enjoyed our experience!

My nieces had been wanting to try this place and after seeing the April/May deal, we decided to go last night about 6:30 pm. It was buzzing with kids, teenagers and families which was exactly what was expected. There was a long line to get to the counter where she was very nice but you can only get a wristband from her. So, in order to bowl, do laser tag or play on the gravity ropes, you have to go across the whole place to get signed up on a list. We were quoted an hour to bowl, laser tag was quoted at 8:45 and the ropes were booked til 10. Great...now what? So, we asked the girl working the winners circle, which is where you go sign up for everything else, how the arcade games work. Alexa told us that for 9.95, we could have unlimited games. We were like...oh neat! So, we went back up and the young man up there said that it was 9.95 for 20$. Totally makes more sense but when she originally gave us our card, it had 40$ on it. Confusing as he'll. They should tell you how long the waits are when you buy your wristband. I had enough money to keep us entertained but if they were there on their own, their allowance would have run out in the 1st 30 min. Every game was at least a dollar to play. Ridiculous. After an hour and a half, I spoke to a manager and said we were quoted an hour to bowl, it's been an hour and a half. Can we just have our money back and lo and behold!! Our name was called next.By now , it was 8:15-8:30   and we bowled 1 game and left. Its a very confusing system, and I think the management should have someone who knows what they're going at the winners circle which is the only register that needs constant attention and multi tasking skills. Nobody looked happy to work there. Also, my niece loves those claw machines and on the bling king one where you could win a watch or bracelet etc...was a total piece of junk. The claw didn't even close, not even a little bit. The other one, wouldn't close all the way. Crappy equipment, under trained staff, long wait times and managers who don't see any of this.....bad business.

My nieces love Chipotle. I've tried it 2 times and have been dissatisfied both times. This time there: The chicken was slimy and everything was cold. The kid at the front said they were out of rice but never even checked on a new batch, just looked down, realized there was none in the pan and said they were out. I chose brown rice, took 2 steps forward and someone brought rice over to him. I asked for a side of that rice and they gave me a side of fresh rice no problem...but it was sticky and cold. There's probably 10 teenagers working there with no actual adult in sight at their busiest time.

I reviewed this about 6 months ago and when it came up, I noticed my review was gone. This makes me wonder if the reason they have so many good reviews is because the bad ones disappear!?? Lucky for me, and you, I remember how everything was. We shared a croque madam and it came with a tiny forgettable salad. The dressing was bomb though. We each had a french onion soup which was pretty lame for the price and shared some cold fries. When we finally got our servers attention from dawdling around the kitchen, she had the fries remade which I guess means putting them back in the fryer. Really? Gross! We had our hands in there and they came back out and the fries that we had tasted and put back were in there and they were brown and dripping of grease. Old grease...ew. We thought. ...ok....we'll try dessert. The macaroons fell apart when you bit into them. Just horrible, overpriced crap. Oh yeah....and when we ordered hot tea, the server brought over the box and stood there until we made our choice. I just looked at her and assured her I wouldn't steal her tea, but I needed a minute to decide. Lame. This place sucks.

Beautiful park, very nice staff although extremely slow. All the lines to the brick and mortar places were always 6-7 deep because this staff was so slow. No biggie, its a nice day out and I'm enjoying it. I finally get up to the front and order my garlic fries and a bottle of water. Whoa.....what? 4.50 for a bottle of water? That's just plain ol highway robbery. 4.50? 4.50! I was appalled and it kinda ruined the rest of my experience there.

I've been here more than I'd like to admit. I feel like that kid on the playground that's always trying to be friends with the mean kids. Kimmy is funny and sweet but literally every time I go there, it's an hour wait for an eyebrow wax. I love the way she does my brows, and I can (and do) go to one of the other 20 nearby places but I don't want to. I wish they would hire more people or let someone's feet soak for the 5 minutes it takes to do my brows. It's called multi tasking and it's easy. I've had to let my feet soak while waiting. People generally understand. Get your priorities straight kimmy, you could have soooo much more business.

I was up here and wanted some grub while running errands and saw the pizza buffet special for 6 bucks, so I ran in here to grab a quick lunch. I should've looked at the pizza and salad before....and honestly felt a little lame after I left this area and realized how many other places there are in this lot alone. Potbelly sandwiches, Capriottis, Andale to name a few....but I just wanted pizza. Anyways, I paid and went to the buffet and all the pizza had sweaty cheese like it had been there awhile. There were 3 salads and they were already mixed and tossed with massive amounts of dressing. Gross. I waited til they put out a new pizza and got a couple pieces of that and called it quits. There weren't a ton of people in there and I guess if I weren't in such a hurry, I would've put all these clues together and just skipped this place all together.

Brought the little guy in today to check out the homemade goodness at Super Chunk and we loved it! We tried the creme brulee croissant, the cinnamon and sugar croissant and some kind of pastry that began with a K and ended with YUM!! The John and Yoko is still in the fridge but I snuck a bite and its amazing. The owner was present and told us about everything. There were cookies, gum drops, popcorn and ice cream all made daily. I cant wait to go back! This is an old town, locally owned company and these people are extremely talented.

Ok. So. I asked for a peanut butter and jelly for the little guy and she brought me peanut butter and bread. C'mon....any server with a brain would've made that happen. I had a Reuben and it was forgettable. I've been to the one in Bisbee and these 2 places are like polar opposites. In Bisbee, it was cozy and homey feeling, this one felt sterile and lame. I dunno, I just didn't like it.

Seriously,  this is the worst ice cream Ive ever tasted. Or not tasted, I should say. My friend got a coffee shake with brownie bites. Coffee was bitter and brownies were non-existent. I got a dipped cone that tasted like waxed chocolate. Vanilla ice cream was bland as well. The best part was it was $20 for 3 cones and a small shake. Do yourself a favor and skip this place....ugh...I can still taste the waxy coating on my shitty dipped cone.

My mom and I saw Wicked last night and had dinner here before the show. As I walked in there was a super nice lady going out as I came in and she welcomed me in and came by our table a couple times to check on things so I'm assuming she was the manager/owner. Super sweet and I really loved the fact that she was actually working! Kaitee was our server and she was fantastic as well. We never needed anything as she was totally on top of it. We started of with fried cheese curds but they were totally overcooked as there was literally, absolutely  no cheese inside. I had the grilled cheese and brisket sandwich with the homemade tomato soup. Soup was lukewarm but great and there was way too much sauce on the brisket. It overpowered the havarti and sourdough bread. Mom had the turkey avocado sandwich with soup and enjoyed it. Kaitee offered us dessert and we ordered the salted carmel ice cream, which it turned out  they were out of but she got us some vanilla bean with homemade carmel sauce. Delicious! The decor was cute and the check presenter was a book which I thought totally fit the theme of the restaurant. Overall, it was a great experience and I'll definitely go back....possibly  when I go see the Book of Mormon!

Listen. ....Keenen is the shiiiittttt!!! We had a 6 top and he was a little busy but totally had time to take care of us! It was my friends bday and we just had a blast. He was teasing me about ordering a salad and helped my friends order properly etc... I had a chef salad and my other friends all had chicken and waffles. All were delicious! We had a lot of cocktails and a lot of fun. Thank you Keenen and Lolos!

What an adorable cafe! Service was great, food was perfectly cooked as well. I had 2 poached eggs, an english muffin, cottage cheese and fruit. The fruit was all fresh and there were strawberries, melons,grapes and pineapple. My friend had biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs and bacon. Portions were big and she loved, loved, loved the bacon. The chef, Tim,  came out and checked on our order and chatted us up a bit. He was so personable and it was a real treat since chefs don't generally do that. If I'm back in that area, I'd definitely go back. Also as a side note, they serve booze.

When we 1st walked in thru the patio area, we were looking for a host stand. We peeked around the bar, saw a host stand and were seated immediately. This was a Saturday night at 6 but the place was pretty empty. We were promptly greeted by our server, I forgot her name, and drinks came out right away. We had the chips and salsa, street corn dip and a variety of tacos. The green chili chicken, bbq adobo and pineapple pork were all very tasty. You can have them on soft flour or corn or hard shell. The sweet corn ceaser and totrtilla soup were both a hit with our group as well. Service was fantastic and the restaurant is so cute. I'll definitely go back!  Update! I went in yesterday and Levi was our server. He was training someone and they were fantastic! The sangria was tasty and we tried the guacamole, which was creamy and delicious. I did a salad that was awesome. Quinoa, seeds, papaya and we added steak. It was with the best vinaigrette I think Ive ever had. Coconut! Amazeballs. Plantain taco was also great. All 5 of us really loved everything. This place is highly recommended.

I got this card from a friend since my car broke down and and I needed a ride for a few days. I have absolutely  no complaints. Shocking, I know!! The price was fair, the car was clean, the driver was so nice and helpful. He (Ben)scheduled my pick up when he dropped me off so I knew he'd be outside waiting for me after work. Fast, efficient and friendly.....I'll take it!

Once again as you've seen on other posts, this is by far the worst company. My premium each month was 164.88. I got a bill for over 300 and when I finally got on the phone with a CSR, I was told they were having billing issues and to just keep paying the 164. I've paid that for 3-4 months and Im scheduled to get a minor foot surgery in 4 days and I was informed that I was cancelled due to non payment. They've taken my $$ every month, and my 2000 deductible and even paid my PCP out for other issues but now Im terminated? After waiting 43 minutes, I finally get a rude ass lady on the phone, she informs me that when bills come, I should pay them, thats how it works. I thanked her for letting me know how bills work since I'm the tender age of 45 and wasn't aware. You gotta be kidding me. Condescending, inefficient and downright rude. Then, she tells me this is a Marketplace problem and I should call them. I do that and they say, no its THEIR  issue. I've taken time off work ( which is a whole other animal) and I'm just at a loss what to do. I guess I'll just have to go to their office here in Phx and talk face to face with someone. Do yourself a favor and never use this company. Ever.

Pho Cao just moved to our neighborhood so we decided to check it out and we're glad we did. We tried the fried tofu and the spicy mayo served with it was ok but we asked our server to bring peanut sauce and that was awesome. The dumplings had a delicious filling and great sauce as well. There was also hoison sauce, soy and sriracha on the table. I love sauces so I was in heaven! Jessica was our server and she was super nice, attentive and helpful with the menu. I got the chicken and veggies on egg noodles but....I added chinese sausage, which is my favorite!  It was really flavorful and there were a lot of veggies including bok choy, cabbage, onion, carrot etc...my main complaint was the music. Although it was jazz and not a bad band at all, it was just too loud.

I've tried to go here twice and both times they were closed. There was a note on the door saying there was an equipment malfunction but that note has been on the door for over a week now.  I don't do corporate places ever so I was looking forward to this place but it's annoying to drive all the way there just to see that stupid note on the door. They shouldn't have opened their doors without working out all the kinks.  Ok....so I went back for the free donuts today and I thoroughly enjoyed them. We tried the bacon maple and the salted caramel and they were both delicious! We also tried both the iced teas, green and black...also great. The people behind the counter were very sweet and accommodating. I always support local businesses and although I can't imagine being a "regular " at a donut shop, I will definitely try this place again!

I've been here several times and its always so good! I got a coupon for buy one get one free on the Italian beef sandwiches. My friend had never been here so I told her to meet there. I usually have the burger but opted for the beef since I had the coupon. It was delicious! Get it with hot AND sweet peppers and if you get fries, get the cheese sauce. You're welcome. The service is always friendly and consistent as well. Top it off with a chocolate cake shake and then hit the gym twice the next day!

I'm so incredibly irritated right now. I just had a long ass day at work and stopped by to grab a salad to take home. I ordered from the drive thru and asked for no tomatoes. I pulled up to pay and confirmed no tomatoes. Yep! I get to the pick up window and seriously confirm again because I really hate tomatoes. Guess what? You can imagine my disappointment. So I call and tell Rebecca, who answered the phone, that not only did my salad not come with a muffin as it said on the drive thru menu, but there were tomatoes on my damn salad. This is her response..."well, we don't serve muffins anymore and I'll get someone on the phone about your salad" all condescending and rude. I just hung up because I've already had a bad day and this chick is not gonna even make it worse. Mistakes happen, I get it but if you're going to have someone answer your phones, you should probably not have someone as snotty as Rebecca doing it.

Loved this place! Cute, clean and simply delicious! We tried the chicken taco, barbacoa and a pork. There were 4 types of chicken, 3 pork and 3 beef. Then...soooo many choices of toppings. The staff was friendly and the prices were fair. Check it out for sure!

My dad was in town to buy me a new car and we had looked at a few Kia dealerships as I wanted a Soul and I looked online and found Precision. When we 1st pulled up, we were a little taken back because it didn't seem as if there were any cars but lo and behold, when we walked in the warehouse, there were hundreds of cars to choose from. The lady at the front desk hooked us up with Ryan and he was really cool. He explained to us that they have a "no hassle"  type of stance on selling cars. We felt no pressure and were able to look around at our leisure. He showed us where the 3 Kias were and we test drove the 2 I liked. I chose one and we paid for it. Period. Done. Ryan sent us into Jack's office for title, registration etc...he was just as cool. They make quite a team! My only complaint would be...no 2nd key (Ryan said on wed morning, I could get a free key cut) no spare tire, chip in the windshield and burn in the seat. I didnt see any of these things as I didn't look for them. I think they should make a list of little things like this and tell the buyer but they're no biggie to me. I still had a great experience. Thanks Team JA!

My family met here tonight to grab some food and catch up. There were 10 of us and they accommodated us on the patio. Vanessa was our server and she was fantastic. She helped us with the menu and was super funny. She handled us all ordering at different times like a champ. I've waited tables for 20+ years and needy tables are the worst but she was not bothered by us at all. When I come back, I'll definitely ask for her again. Ok, now the food. I had the bbq burger, cooked to perfection with sweet potato waffle fries. It was absolutely delicious. Mom had a chef salad, uncles had a club like sandwich and a french dip. Sisters had prime rib sliders and a chicken sandwich. Nephew got the philly cheesesteak. Everyone was happy with their choices. We also got all 3 cheese, meat and fruit boards which were 7 bucks each! Loaded with cheeses, all kinds, salami, prosciutto and  fresh fruit. A-MAZ-ING. I can't wait to go back! Only complaint was that stupid jenga game. They should put a rug underneath it so it's not so loud when it falls.

I don't live in the area but I had a minor foot surgery on Tuesday and mom took me here hoping to make me feel better.....it worked! The young man behind the counter was super friendly and told us about the menu and what was popular etc.. I got the chocolate stuffed waffle, topped with banana and homemade whipped cream. O....M....G...it was delicious! They use chocolate sticks and push them inside so they get all nice and melted inside. Mom had the biscoff (cookie butter) ,strawberry and whipped. That was extraordinary as well. He informed us there is a food truck as well in town. I saw them on the great Food Truck Race but didn't know there was one in town! Find them and try one of these incredible waffles!

Totally, 100% enjoyable. Jane is the owner and she was very attentive and so adorable. I had the ham, egg and cheese crepe to which I added bacon. Perfection. My niece had the specialty salmon, tomato and avocado. She loved it but said it was so big she couldn't finish it. Grammy had the same as me but added some lingonberry jelly. Oh so good. We had some homemade Gelato to top off our visit. As we were leaving, Jane asked us to please take some cookies due to the fact she was leaving for a month for her birthday, vacation etc... what a sweet little place. I'll definitely be back.

OMG...get here. This place was nothing short of fantastic. We got here at 4 and had the place to ourselves. The happy hour is so great. We had the  potstickers, spring rolls, skewers of pork and chicken,coconut curry hot pot, the short ribs, the tofu....jesus, all of it was outstanding!  Free bottle of sake for your 1st checkin with yelp too! Sami was our server and was on top of it. We thoroughly enjoyed everything. Oh yeah, we had mango ice cream dusted with a rice flour. Everything. ...amazing.

I haven't been here since it was Dos. It was pretty slow last night and I didn't really explore the whole place but the place seemed very clean and the menu was great. We had the totchos with Carnitas which were fan...freakin...tastic. Everybody else had a chicago dog and loved them. We had a great time and things were reasonably priced. Robert was our bartender/server  and he is, hands down, a total asset to this place! Great, great service. We'll definitely go back.

Found this little gem on Yelp and glad we tried it! The menu seems a tad confusing at 1st but the lady at the front quickly explained it to us and it became very clear. You order the style or items you want and add the protein or you're welcome to make up your own. Salads all looked great but we decided on the Cali with which had edamame, quiona, kale, cheese and we added chicken. Delicious! We thought the portion seemed small but it was plenty! We got the flatbread with artichokes, chicken, carmelized onions, fig balsamic and kale pesto. Absolutely delicious. The staff was all very nice. I'd definitely go back and try some other stuff. Lastly, when I went to refill my tea, it was in a different spot next to one of servers cutting lemons with NO gloves. Ew. I'm glad I didn't have lemon in my tea because I would've definitely said something.
