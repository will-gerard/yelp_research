Kinda bummed to be writing this review after the expectations set, but I should have known the slow reviews would mean something would go awry with my must be on time lunch for a work event. I called a day ahead and spoke with Michelle to let her know I was coming to Casa Grande the following day and would be calling with a large order... She told me that was fine and to give them my order in the morning.  I spoke with Michelle in the morning and got an email address to send the orders over to so I could ensure they would all be right. I gave her payment info and confirmed delivery time and she asked if I wanted to include gratuity. I told her to call me back with a total... A few hours went by and we were nearing the time I needed lunch to be delivered by... She said she was sorry they had a busy lunch and she would again call me back with my order total but had a few questions. I asked her again if the order would be there on time and she assured me it would... However the time she quoted for the delivery driver leaving and the time on the clock didn't match- they had misunderstood the delivery date. Through our phone call which I clearly stated we were coming the following day to the email the day of with all the orders and delivery date in the subject and body of the email, I don't understand how that was missed. To top it all off, out of the 17 orders I had, mine was left back at the cafe.   They did rush and get everything to us roughly 25-30 minutes after our lunch was scheduled to happen... But if you need a timely lunch or delivery, I wouldn't count on it.

Getting my nails done is the one luxury I'm pretty consistent with and I've gone to a LOT of the nail salons in the valley. Besides the fact that Nail Lacquer is just moments from my house, I feel like I always leave there satisfied (and I can be picky about my nails!!) All of the nail techs take their time and ensure that you leave happy. They also just got a TON of new gel colors in which is great because I like to switch it up AND they are always down to try new designs and trends. Hot stones and a 10 minute  massage are standard for their classic pedicures. Solid.  Weekdays are the best times to go because it can get busy on the weekends. I always try and call ahead before I go and that seems to help. Wendy, Sasha, Danny, the new owner (goodness I forget her name), and just about everyone else... -  they are all great!

Just returned from a delicious dinner at Tom's. Billy behind the counter was great- extremely personable and made the great food that much better. I had the brisket and you could cut it with a fork... yumm :) Fiance had the pulled pork in which he grudgingly shared a taste with me because he was enjoying it so much. Will def. be back- keep on doing what your doing.   Person below me- 3 minute wait? at a dinner place? That's nothing!

Looking for a florist for some bouquets for my niece's dance recital and came up with Bobbie's which happened to be just near our house! Called and talked with a very nice woman who listened to my wants of pink and glitter in the midst of x-mas week! The bouquets they made exceeded my expectations and thrilled my 4 and 6 year old dancing nieces... I seriously think they had the coolest flowers there! I'll be back to check out the cute little store front items and of course for some more flowers!

Really, just not good. Just left The Farm kitchen and was able to sample 4 different kinds of sandwiches. The nice girls at the counter informed us when we were looking at the menu that we could order half and half to try different kinds. I ordered the BBQ pork and the pecan chicken salad- my husband ordered the Italian and the Tuscan. 20 minutes later... Our order still hasn't come up but they were serving the majority of the people that came in after us. I finally went up and asked as I didn't think 2 sandwiches would take that long. The guy calling out the numbers gave me some attitude and said he'd check. Moral of the story- we waited way too long for the sandwiches and when we got them it seemed as though maybe they were sitting for a bit as the bread on the BBQ pork sandwich was completely soaked and Inedible... The pecan chicken salad was a few chunks of chicken sandwiched between a big baguette... And funny enough, sans pecans. Italian was prob the best out of the 4, if I could even say that. I should also mention- 30$ for two sandwiches and two drinks... Overpriced and underwhelming.   I was also intending to use the groupon I had purchased on this trip but they weren't accepting because a wine festival was going on nearby... So unfortunately I still have that groupon... But won't be running back anytime soon to use it.

After reading all the other reviews, I was excited to try out George's with my husband. We normally go to Pita Shack in Tempe when we are looking for a good Gyro but we were on the north side of town and wanted to grab a quick dinner. Looked up some options on Yelp which is what led us to Georges. My husband ordered the Gyro with jalape√±os, onions and peppers and I ordered the traditional Gyro with a side salad. We also ordered some Spanakopita and 2 drinks. Honestly the best thing about the meal was the side greek salad. Gyro meat was cold... which was kind of a bummer as we waited just about 15 minutes for the two pitas to come out. What really irked me was after we had checked out and were waiting for our food, a group of guys walked in and the girl asked if it was their first time in and since it was, offered up complimentary drinks. It wasn't like they were busy when we came in, she was just very short and didn't feel like engaging with us. Maybe an off night for the staff and food, but I wouldn't be inclined to go back.

Walking in to Blanco Taco I was craving some good mexican food. Upon sitting down we were greeted with a smile and some yummy chips and salsa. (They should really bag that stuff up and sell it- THAT good.) Our server was cheerful and offered us some margaritas and explained the menu a bit... turns out they had just revamped it a few days before. We were excited to be guinea pigs and I ordered the 'new' camarones tacos and my boyfriend ordered the pork enchiladas along with a couple of classic margaritas.   To begin with... the margaritas were awesome. And then comes the food... delicious! The three street tacos were plenty and the rice that comes with is awesome. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his enchiladas and liked the fact that they were made in layers to ensure a little bit of everything in each bite.   Although we were stuffed our server tempted us to try the flan... and I'm glad they did... it was yummmy! Overall a fantastic experience. Without hesitation, we will be back!

Snapbooth was a great addition to our wedding!! I attended a bridal show and won a free photobooth through a facebook contest that they had. Mike was great to deal with and always responsive via e-mail when I had any questions. He even upgraded me to the white booth which I didn't know until the week of the wedding!!   The night of- the attendants were great, and there were several times throughout the night that I looked over and saw a big line! Everyone of all ages was enjoying it!   One of the best parts about having the photobooth was it also acted as our guest book. Guests were able to write their well wishes on a page with their photo (or photos, in some cases!!) It was great to read everyones comments and see all the fun people were having. At the end of the night, the attendants also gave us a disc with all of the photos taken that night.   Quality of printouts was great- and they use top of the line cameras and equipment. We looked at lots of photobooths while planning and we wouldn't have tried as hard to win the contest if their quality wasn't worth it!! Snapbooth should be a staple at any social event- they've helped us create memories we would have missed if they weren't there! Thanks Mike and team!!

What do I even say! Just finished my first session here and I can already tell that I am going to be a sore girl tomorrow! John was awesome and very patient with my very out of shape self.   I'd highly recommend this to anyone- all of the trainers seem great. Looking forward to another ass whooping on my next session!

If I could give these guys six stars, I would. Everything was just excellent. The slices are ridiculously big and very reasonably priced, but they also know that quality matters- it was all so fresh!!  The guys at the counter were great- even hooked us up with some garlic knots while we were waiting for our slices... yum. We will def. be back- and I'd recommend you stop your lunch/dinner search and head there now!

Yum... just yum. Gadzooks is basically a chipotle for enchiladas, but on another level. I've been there twice and both times it's been delicious. Today, i tried the short rib and chicken enchiladas with 'xmas sauce' (both green and red) with a side of cornbread heaven. Absolutely recommended!

We've used Kama and AAA on multiple occasions to cast talent for our commercial productions. She always comes through with great animal (and when needed, human) talent and is a pleasure to work with!! Always a much smoother process when working with animals to have Kama and her talent on set.

I was in search of a dress for an upcoming event and came across Roxanne's. I sent an email asking for styles and colors that I was eyeing and Lola emailed me back right away. Although they didn't have the Sherri Hill dress that I wanted in stock, she did say she had some other options in my size. I work long hours and my schedule is constantly changing but they were VERY accommodating even telling me I could come in after hours to try on a dress. I ended up going in on a Saturday afternoon and they had a beautiful red dress for me to try on. Although I didn't end up purchasing a dress through Roxannes, their customer service was great, they were very accommodating and willing to help. I'd make sure to look to them for any future dress needs I have and would recommend them based off my experience!
