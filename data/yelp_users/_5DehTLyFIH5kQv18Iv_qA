Forget Whole Foods when you have East End Cooperative! Honestly, this is quite possibly one of my favorite coops. They make some amazing deli items...so amazing that I went back twice during my visit to PA. I was only expecting to have a few options in the prepared food section, but the vegan options were plentiful. Their mock tuna salad was impressive, made with tvp, vegenaise, and spices. The potato salad was creamy and exceptionally delicious. And the vegan pasta salad was also impressive. Generally most grocers fail in this department, but East End excels by leaps and bounds. I can't believe how tasty their store-made food was. The prices were also very reasonable, if not low. If I lived in PA, I'd join their coop and would go there frequently.

OMG AMAZING VEGAN DONUTS!  These donuts tasted like non-Vegan donuts! My friend had to try these when we were in Vegas. The one thing I want to say is that I wish I could eat more than one donut at a time [I have a problem eating sweets in large quantities]!!! The owner was incredibly nice and although the place seemed older, it felt very welcoming and/or comfortable. We even met some "regulars" who were sitting in the dining area - they were the nicest people ever! If you're in Vegas, it's seriously a few miles off of the strip and is well worth the little drive!

This place makes some good chewy pretzels and the prices are ridiculously reasonable.  I liked the pretzels so much that I ate 5 of the 6 I bought within an hour...I was trying to save them for later, but things like this happen when food is addictive and good.

If you have checked out my Yelp profile, you'd see that I'm a vegan who travels quite frequently.  And when I travel, I eat a lot of vegan food!  Therefore ... I think that I am quite qualified to say that Green makes the BEST VEGAN BURGER in the world.    You got it ... best vegan burger IN THE WORLD.  And do you know which burger I speak of?  It is the glorious Big Wac (with extra Wac sauce).    I have made the pilgrimage to both Green locations for several years now, and the Big Wac is always amazing and still has yet to be beat.    And for you McDonald's lovers, my friend says this burger tastes like a real Big Mac (I've never had one in my life, so I can't confirm).  So just try it.  And if you're flying to Chicago from Arizona, please bring one back for me!!!

If you're going to go raw in Vegan, this is the place to do it!  This restaurant is soooo amazing! The burritos are very tasty.  You have to try their juices as well; they're impressive!

I admit I was a skeptic...a plethora of vegan options at a Las Vegas buffet?  Get out of here, that's a lie!  But it's true, I couldn't believe my eyes.  Before we paid to get into the buffet I inquired about these so-called vegan options thinking that there may only be one or two things for me.  To my surprise they gave me the option to have a chef personally walk me around and tell me what's vegan-friendly and what can be made vegan upon request.  The chef was great, personable, and very knowledgeable about the plant-based diet.  He walked me through every dish and nearly every ingredient, I felt like I was getting star-treatment.  At the end of my little tour I realized I could have at least half of the offerings on the buffet...and that, my friends, is exactly what I did.  I never get to eat at buffets, I exercise, and eat healthy at home, so why not?!?!  I enjoyed many things such as Alfredo pasta (custom-made at the pasta station), many different kinds of salads (quinoa salad, chickpea salad, etc.), many kinds of veggies, vegan tomato soup, sushi, ethnic dishes (aloo gobi, channa masala, etc.), candied apples, and the best vegan chocolate chip cookie baked on this planet.  Mind you, there were many vegan things I just couldn't get to...I filled up sooner than I would have liked.  Overall, this was a great experience, the Wynn is simply impressive.  I highly recommend the buffet to vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores alike.

Vegan burger and fries with a vegan milkshake???  I want!!!  The Wynn has proven to be among one of the best places in Vegas for vegans to enjoy both fine and casual dining at one of its many restaurants, Terrace Point Cafe at the Wynn did not disappoint.  My first recommendation is to request outdoor seating on the patio, how relaxing!  Once seated, request the vegan menu if you're vegan, there are several options for you.  I began my meal with the most amazing appetizer I've had veganized in my life, the spinach artichoke dip - oh how I've missed this dip!  I would say that the dip alone is worth 5 stars and had I known how amazing it was I would have ordered two (and...um...possibly three...it's OK to be a little piggy on vacation, right???) in lieu of an entree.  Then came my much anticipated vegan burger, fries, and milkshake.  I think I mostly enjoyed the novelty of it more than anything, I mean it's pretty rare to get a vegan burger, fries, AND a milkshake anywhere - it even came in a box reminiscent of a fast-food meal.  But overall, I felt the burger was a little boring, it wouldn't hurt if they updated it as I'm sure one of their fancy-pants chefs could come up with something unique/interesting.  The milkshake was made with coconut milk and would have been better off having been made with soy or almond milk as the coconut flavor was overpowering.  So as far as the burger and fries, I don't regret ordering the entree as I enjoyed the novelty of it, however I wouldn't order it again unless they update the burger.  Overall we had a great time, great atmosphere, and pretty fantastic spinach and artichoke dip!

When you go to a place that's named Cien Agaves Tacos & Tequila, you expect your food to take like Mexican food, right?  Not the case here.  I ordered the Lean Green Machine (made vegan by excluding the yogurt) and, aside from it not tasting like Mexican food, the dish was executed poorly. Everyone at the table oohed and aahed at how pretty my dish looked, and commented on how it looked like it must have tasted so good...but was boring. Even more boring was the small amount of alcohol they put in their margaritas.  Come on guys, I can only fit so much in my stomach, I don't want to drink 10 margaritas in order to get a tiny buzz.  Meh overall!

Vegan junk food at its finest! Spak Brothers is not a large restaurant, but the vegan options seem mouthwateringly endless. Let me tell you, they have one hell of a vegan philly cheese steak. This exceptional vegan junk food sandwich came with well-flavored seitan, green peppers, onions, lettuce, tomato, daiya cheese, and vegenaise all within some very tasty bread. Overall, this was one of my favorite meals in Pittsburgh, and I'll surely go back again during my next visit.

The vegan burger looked (and probably) tasted like those crap mystery burgers served in grade school cafeterias in the 90's. And the vegan milkshake was awful. The Wynn/Encore should consider updating this offering, I would not recommend it to anyone.

Vegans, go here immediately!!!  You will not be disappointed!  So to start, this is an excellent place for a fancy-pants meal and it's sure to satisfy any vegan along with their carnivorous counterparts.  If you're vegan be sure to request the vegetarian menu, there are a plethora of options.  And to start, our waitress brought over a bread basket with real butter (for the bf) and vegan butter (for me) and she even let me know which breads I could eat - hooray because I always have to eat bread without butter at restaurants.  Next came my appetizer, the heirloom tomato soup...it was creamy (I think with cashews), flavored well, and down-right delectable!  But the winner of the evening was the entree, the Agnolotti.  It's basically little pockets filled with vegan ricotta and herbs topped with asparagus sauce, yes, asparagus sauce!!!  I'd never had asparagus sauce in my life until Sinatra, and let me tell you, I'm a fan.  A trip to Vegas is not complete without a visit to Sinatra, I'll be back!

This place is so good that I'm incredibly sad I don't live in Vegas! I haven't eaten chicken very much in my life, nor do I remember what it tastes like, but I swear the Vegan "chicken" dishes were the best I've ever had! My friend said his dish [also chicken] tasted like the real thing! The "chicken" is made out of Seitan [my favorite] and is cooked quite well!

I ate at Scramble last Friday and I have to say that it was a horrible experience.  What attracted me to this place was the separate vegan menu in addition to their regular menu - this makes things easier when dining with vegan and non-vegan friends.  So I happily ordered a tofu wrap and added fried potatoes as a side and awaited my food.  We started eating and my friend found a hair in his food...not good!  He threw it on the floor and tried to drop it.  Well moments later I found a hair in my food...  I couldn't believe there was hair on both of our plates!  I was so disgusted I could no longer eat my food (and I was ravenous).  I told the girl working the register about the whole ordeal, she walked back to the kitchen then back to the register and completely ignored me (she said she'd come back to my table).  Before we left I spoke with someone else and showed them the hair, clearly not one of mine.  All I got was "Oh, I'll check the guys in the back."  Check the guys in the back???  What?  How about, sorry may I refund you your money?  Additionally, the few bites I had of my burrito were pretty bland, it needed seasoning or hot sauce.  Overall, I wouldn't go back...unless I somehow develop a taste for hair, although I'm sure that won't happen.  I did take a picture of my food before I attempted eating it and if you zoom in enough you can see part of the hair sticking out of my food - I'll be posting them.

I had the Ramen vegan style and LOVED it!  Expertly flavored food and presented beautifully!  The Ginever drink was perfect and highly memorable.  Can't wait to eat here again!

Almost everything can be made vegan at Red Velvet Café...hooray!  Now with all the options, something I am a stranger to, I was in quite the conundrum when it came to actually picking something.    My dining partner and I began with the fire fries entrée, consisting of baked potatoes of various color, hot sauce, Pico de Gallo, and vegan cheese - these were some pretty tasty potatoes, I'm a fan!  So I narrowed my choice of entrée down to the paninis and went with the recommendation of the waiter, the California Panini.  It was a good sandwich overall, but the fake turkey was made with the popular fake meat brand from Asia (if you know of the product name, please let me know), a fake meat that I am in no way a fan of.  I picked the fake meat off and was left with tomatoes and avocados, still good but not substantial.  The food is truly good here and I will go again, but next time I will order the veggie panini.

This is an excellent place to go after enjoying a Big Wac (aka best vegan burger in the world...believe me, I travel a ton for work and have tried many) next door at Green Vegetarian (literally next door, same parking lot). I've tried all kinds of things from Nami and everything has always great (e.g., vegan twinkies, donuts, etc.). The item of praise this go around has to be the soft serve ice cream, for which there was a 25 minute wait--that's how popular it is!  If you're in town a few days, Green Vegetarian and Nami are a must.

Seriously ... Such a cute tea shop!    I had tea here with one of my friends before my plane ride back to the frozen tundra, also known as Chicago.  I was happy to find that Songbird offered LOOSELEAF TEA and not crappy bagged tea.  The woman who helped us (from Rockford, IL ... can't remember her name) was the friendliest person in Arizona as well.  And the tea was pretty darn good.    Check ... It ... Out
