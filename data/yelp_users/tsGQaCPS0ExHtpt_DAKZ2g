I was here Sunday morning ordering 2 drinks, both frappuccinos. The cashier proceeded to say how she "hates frappaccinos" and she couldn't find the button on the screen to select a certain one and therefore blamed the manager for not adding it. The young man making the drinks was just as clueless and instead of trying to help her AND us they started talking about gangster rap and what kind of music they listen too. It took me 7 minutes to order my drink and another 10 to receive them both. These two were incredibly slow and not paying attention to the customer, just stopping what they're doing to talk about rap music. Needless to say that was my first and last experience at the Starbucks. Poor service all the way around.

I called last week to inquire about catering our holiday party. We have a lady in our offer who has Celiac and CV is all GF so we were excited to order form here this year. I was speaking with the manager and he was incredibly short with me and the 4-5 questions I was asking. Simple things like the order minimum, if they include chafes, little things. He finally RUDELY interrupted me and asked if I had any other questions. I was a bit put off and I politely said, "I guess not, thank you!" and he immediately hung up.   After that conversation we decided to go back to Cafe Rio, whom we used the last two years for our holiday party, even though they are not GF friendly, their service is excellent! I will not be recommending your catering to anyone as the manager was just incredibly rude, wish it were different.

The service was mediocre, but the happy hour was amazing. Unfortunately our waiter got my order wrong and my dates drinks wrong, twice. I didn't complain about my food being wrong, i just picked off what wasn't supposed to be on there. My date took the beer that was given to him , even though it was the wrong choice. Then ordered a second margarita and the server didn't ring it in until we asked him 10 mins later where the drink was. Our server was very apologetic and told us not to worry about the margarita and it was on him. When we got the bill we were delightfully surprised he also comped the beer and took $$ off my order that was wrong. He was great and it was unexpected - we will definitely be back!

Went here for the first time on Saturday and Charrae was our server. It took quite some time for her to take our order but when she came over she was not very pleasant - seemed rushed and frustrated and when I asked a question it was as if it was a burden for her to answer it and her huffing and attitude. So I just left it at that.   Next we noticed all the other tables around us that she was helping, she was incredibly talkative and asking questions - basically she was the complete opposite of what we got.   Our food took over 25 mins to get (no biggie) but she didn't even come back to check on us all the while going to every other table around us to serve their food, check in on them, etc...we finally asked another waiter to kindly grab our tab or our waitress and she finally returned with our tab.  Overall, I expected to be there for max an hour but it took us almost two hours from sit down to paying. Basically our food was good but the service was terrible. Charrae seemed annoyed and didn't engage us at all, kind of disappointing.
