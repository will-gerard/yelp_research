I booked a trip for my wife's birthday and got a call the night before stating that "mother nature" is canceling our tour.  I looked at the forecast instantly and Phoenix is scheduled for 4mph winds at 6am.  Needless to say, they COMPLETELY RUINED what was going to be a special time for my wife and I.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Great Barbershop with a friendly staff.  I have never gotten a bad haircut here in the 1+ years I have been visiting Mugsy's.
