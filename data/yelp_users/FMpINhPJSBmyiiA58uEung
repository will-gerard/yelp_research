I have been coming to this salon for two years and the last two experiences have caused the salon to lose my business completely.  the nail tech named Judy made both of these experiences extremely uncomfortable and unpleasant. she was very rude and I felt pushed around and like a huge inconvenience.  she kept repeating everything that was extra and kept adding things on like if I wanted my nails long it would be extra. SINCE WHEN??  she then told me she wouldn't put a gel coat on top of my nails because it would take too long.  I will be more than happy to go miles out of my way to a new salon in the future to avoid ever having this happen again.

Went here with a friend the other night. Decided to sit in the dining room because I haven't seen it before. Someone brought us waters but no one greeted us for at least 5 minutes, so we decided to move down to the bar downstairs. It was only a couple minutes before happy hour ended and the bartender threw in some food and drinks for us which we were delighted by. But the rest of the visit was less than pleasing. Both of the bartenders were detached and not warm, or welcoming. I honestly felt like we were a burden (although there were only three other people at the bar) it felt like we were getting the cold shoulder. The guy bartender did not smile once. Let alone make eye contact. FOOD: the oysters were more disappointing. They were not shucked whatsoever and they were too large, and did not taste fresh. I let them know and they were taken from me but without apology or any action taken to remedy the situation besides taking half of the order off of the bill.  Needless to say we decided not to order anything else, the uncomfortable visit went on long enough.  I'm extremely disheartened by this and when before I would recommend this place to friends, I will not be returning and I will not subject others to this.

Let me first start off with the fact that I literally just left this establishment. I always love take out from pei Wei so this has nothing to do with the food. It is all service. For one the building smelled like sewage which i understand can happen due to location but it took my appetite away. Second, I walked in and two young girls were standing at the counter. One was changing a roll of receipt paper a foot away from me and completely ignored me. Then turned her back to the line. The other girl was talking to a customer for about a minute  and the customer left. She then looks up at me, doesn't say a word, and proceeds to turn her back to me and text on her cell phone in plain sight for several minutes. This whole time, neither girl acknowledges me whatsoever but I am clearly standing at the counter waiting to be helped. A young man comes and asks the girls if I have been helped and without looking up the both respond no. He helps me and is friendly and fast so I am not completely furious. I still tipped the staff because I work in the industry, but I will never return to this location if this is how they are trained and managed.

Yum yum yum! Prices are so low for the amount of food you get. Last time I called in takeout, the vegetables with the ph√≥ are fresh and plentiful. Love this place!

Lily is AMAZING! She is fast and efficient, and gives me exactly what I want. finding the right lash artist is tough, and I finally found someone who does the perfect job.  I highly recommend her if you're looking for someone who will give you beautiful lashes!
