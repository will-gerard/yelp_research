What a cluster and a fiasco to get I to a class...people have old passes and different passes which mess up the number of people for the class. 3 of is tried to go to cycle class and didn't get a bike even with a pass and our name on the list. This is the worst location in the valley. I drove 10 mikes to get here...thanks for nothing you guys! I'm sticking to scottsdale. Just wish they had more options for cycle...

The RPM and Cycle classes are awesome! Ginny and Stephanie are so much fun and keep the classes super exciting and intense! The gym could use some updated equipment but, overall a good gym.

Owners are JERKS!! Service sucks! Plan on waiting a really long time unless you have the owners number to text her...she says "baby, unless you text me, YOU WAIT!!! The sushi isn't that great and the drinks are over priced...Stingray is better!

I went in yesterday in a bind because I had put my wifi SIM card in my phone and completely messed things up. I was in a hurry as I work in medical sales and had some patients trailing my equipment and I was asked to be avab....Kathleen and another gentleman were SO friendly and patient. Kathleen had my phone working very quickly. Thanks your help! You are awesome!

I am absolutely obsessed with OTF! PV is my closest location and the staff and trainers are awesome and friendly. The music and concept gets me pumped up and I look forward to the gym. I've been going for 14 months and I have never loved a workout like OTF!

If you're looking for lovely, full and beautiful lashes, Ashley's Beauty bar is the place to go. Ashley does a fantastic job. I have been seeing her since they opened and she's thorough and makes sure you don't leave without having Amazing lashes. Mine stay on for about 2-3 weeks and I am part of the lash club so it's perfect for me and my budget.

What a great place! Excellent food and a friendly atmosphere! We met the owner and Chef outside one afternoon and they were super friendly and invited us to come check the place out when it opened. So we did and they remembered us and treated us with nothing but kindness. This will definitely be our new spot!! Yummmm!
