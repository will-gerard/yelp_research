dont bother wasting your money. Our white truck came out filthy and we had to direct the cleaners to finish the job. the underside of the outer molding was still dirty and the mirrors were half armoralled. the interior was still filthy. 2nd time going and wont ever go again. the first was with my scion and had the same issues.

went to get my nails done for the first time today. I was not impressed. They used the rotary file to file the tips, and burned my finger, every nail was filed crooked. I have a good mind to go get my money back!

The consultation with this attorney was our second, and we left feeling secure with our decision. This firm is not just about making money, but teaching us about debt relief and leaving us with the knowledge of WHY so many cannot get out of the hole. He spent a good part of 2 hours with us, making sure we understood every aspect possible, and we left with a history lesson of magnitude. He was very knowledgeable in his practice and I would recommend him highly

I have been in to see Niki on two separate occasions, and she was AWESOME! She is nationally certified and knows her stuff. She uses trigger point, without pain, but you will know shes been there the next day :) . If you have stiff joints, sciatic pain, or just need lymphatic drainage, book with her! You will NOT be disappointed :)

I also had a wart treated, yeah, its still there.I am an aesthetician and know what I am talking about. Good luck if you're referred here and get Marlene Wright. Im seeking another office
