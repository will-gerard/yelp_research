Great food and great service for a fast food Mexican restaurant.  What more could you ask for.

I decided to take my wife and friends out for dinner at Kelly's to try some place new. Unfortunately we were very disappointed with their service. When we had our appetizers delivered to our table, we had to wait roughly 15 minutes to receive plates and drink refills. When it came to our entrees they were mismatched and incorrect. We were also charged for their mistakes. E.g. Side of fries ordered, delivered salad. They charged us for the salad then said they would bring the fries at no charge. So we thought! They ended up charging us for both the salad and the side of fries and the side of fries were to be included for free with the entree. We were also charged for an additional dessert that we never ordered. We had asked to order some coffee after dinner and were told that they ran out of coffee around 11am this morning. Really!?! I would strongly advise against dining at Kelly's. It appears that it is more of an establishment for drinking than dining.
