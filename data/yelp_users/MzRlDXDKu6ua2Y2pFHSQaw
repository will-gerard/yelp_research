Watch out for this Queen Creek location. Basically made my husband think he HAD to buy rental car insurance for the rental while our truck was in the body shop. Told him that USAA would not cover anything that happened to the car. Once we figured out we got ripped off, my husband called them out on it over the phone. Took a 30 minute phone call to finally get them to drop the $400 charge to $125. Liars and swindlers. Don't go to Enterprise.

A family business with good values! Did a great job and offered to touch up on some work that needed some attention a year later. Highly recommend! Great prices too compared to the competition.
