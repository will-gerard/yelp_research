I was referred to Shayne by a colleague of mine; I was looking for someone who was competent, organized, and reasonably priced.  Like many small business owners, I'm very busy - it's easy for me to let my bookkeeping get out of control or to forget about a tax deadline until the last minute. Shayne stays on top of things for me, which allows me to focus on what I do best - running my business. I've recommended her to everyone I know.

I love Rosati's...price is a little higher than some other restaurants, but you get what you pay for. Last night I ordered delivery from this location for the first time and the pizza showed up pretty rough - delivery guy must have been going for speed; about 1/4 of the pizza had folded up over itself. I posted a picture on their facebook page and got an apology in a few hours and a call from the owner the following morning. Jason (the owner) made things right - this is how a small business should be run.  PS the portion of the pizza that did survive was delicious :)

Should have read the reviews before I went. Check out the pictures I've included.  After the salesman charged me for a "works" when I wanted a basic, I wasn't happy but wasn't going to stress over $3. Long story short, apparently he gave me a VIP for the "works" price. I came out and saw what's shown in the picture.   When I asked the worker if he would be happy if this was his car, he said, "do you want me to run it through again?" NO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO RUN IT THROUGH AGAIN. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR 2 CAR WASHES. Remember, this is their VIP service ($20 wash)
