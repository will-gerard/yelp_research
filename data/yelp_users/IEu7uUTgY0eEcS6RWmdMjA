This is unfortunate because, ask me three days ago & I would've given this place 5 stars! Maggie is our favorite bartender around. We live right down the street, frequent the bar often, bring friends, and spend money. However, on the few times we've been in when Jaxx was working, we've noticed that she often seems intoxicated and has never been overtly nice to us...fine...it's a dive bar. But being that we all either ARE or WERE bartenders, we know how customers should be treated and we know how to take care of our bartenders. On one particular occasion, a group of us ordered 6 beers and 6 shots and were charged a whopping $110! A rip-off even by Snottsdale standards! After confronting Jaxx about the bill, an altercation ensued which moved OUTSIDE of the bar and resulted in Jaxx hitting one of our female friends in the face! It's such a drag because we live in the hood and LOVE this bar. Maggie works Wed-Sat nights...I recommend avoiding this place like the plague any other time.

We had a LOVELY brunch here earlier this year. I'm bummed I didn't write our server's name down because she was amazing. I do remember she had a beautiful accent-maybe someone will be able to fill in the blank here!!! Perfect during the spring months while the weather is gorgeous and the little boutique is adorable. One of our favorite spots, still!

My younger brother was driving around in a 98 Honda Civic with no a/c AND no window tint...I just couldn't have that!  I found this place on Yelp & called to get a quote.  I spoke to Roman-who I gather does just about everything here-& he was very nice & straightforward.  He quoted me a price & stuck to it.  He didn't try to sell my brother a bunch of other crap that he didn't ask for although my brother did say that Roman told him he could replace his windshield (which he needs, too) so I have a feeling we'll be headed back soon!  Roman even called me after the service was complete & took my credit card over the phone so I could give the service to my brother as a gift.  I would certainly call him again!

I'll admit, I'm kind of obsessed with this place. In fact, my hubby had to hold a minor intervention when I was visiting multiple times per week! The staff is great, the food is AMAZING-I haven't tried a thing I didn't like, and they have great happy hour specials.  It's a must-try!

I've never been to Binkley's, but have always heard it's incredible. We decided to try Bink's for Sunday brunch (THE best meal of the week, right?!?) and were not disappointed. We started with a cinnamon roll appetizer-I didn't see it on the menu, but I saw it on the table next to us and just HAD to have it! It was unbelievable. I had the eggs benedict-my favorite breakfast menu item. I am often disappointed with overcooked poached eggs, but these were total perfection. The mimosas were delicious and the patio was lovely. I hope there are plans to update this neighborhood which is really the only drawback (and that's being picky). I think Bink's is an amazing destination spot and I'm looking forward to returning for dinner sometime!

I've been getting waxed for years so the experience is nothing new to me.  I decided to try LunchBOX for the first time today after visiting the Scottsdale location during their Grand Opening celebration.  I booked an appointment online when I first woke up and was given several options to meet my service and schedule needs. The online booking was very easy to use.  I arrived a few minutes early and was greeted upon entering by two smiling faces.  I was offered water and asked to fill out a quick form with general questions about skin care and medication.  When I was finished, one of the girls took my paperwork and immediately introduced herself to me as Bria, my "waxologist"...I thought that was pretty cute.  Bria led me to a room where she confirmed what services I would be receiving (a brazilian and lower leg wax), handed me a clean wipe for my unmentionables (I think this is genius for those of us who make this stop after running around all day!) and a small sheet to cover up with.  She left the room while I undressed and returned in a timely manner.  The room is beautifully decorated-white and clean-and the music was nice.  Bria was really sweet-we laughed about how happy my hubby would be after my appointment as I had waited a little longer than usual between services.  I joked that he might even send her flowers!  She chatted pleasantly, but also let me relax when I closed my eyes.  She also checked on me several times asking if the wax was a comfortable temperature or if I was in any pain.  Again, I am used to the feeling, but it was nice to know she cared.  Also, they use soft wax & strips which I am not used to for brazilians, but they also take smaller sections than usual which I think made it a little less painful.  The wax also smells really good!  The entire experience-both services-took less than 45 minutes and she showed me the exfoliant I would need to avoid ingrown hairs (which I often get), but didn't make me feel like I HAD to buy it...but I did anyway-I know the value of a good product to prolong a good service!  All in all it was a great experience and I will definitely be back.  I pre-booked for 4 weeks and got a confirmation text before I even left the parking lot...sweet!
