Not sure why this location has received so many bad reviews! I used to work directly across the street from this location and would go here for lunch AT LEAST 2 times a week. I still make it down there occasionally since i no longer work in phoenix. The owner and his wife are always so sweet and chatty, they remind me so much of my grandparents. I compare all schlotzky's to this one, and most fail in comparison.  My favorite sandwich to this day is the Albuquerque Turkey with lots of their hot sauce... now my mouth is watering... As far as "poor choice of sides" go, good luck finding a franchise sandwich shop that serves fries! I prefer chips with my sandwich anyways... anyhoo.. if you are in the area around lunch time be prepared for a line, but it goes quick! :)

This is a wonderfully modern and BIG office. I believe there are 5-7 OB's in the practice so you have plenty to choose from. Just beware if you pick a popular one, their case load is huge and they probably won't remember you from the next gal. Overall a good office with great doctors!

It truly saddens me to see such bad reviews for this place. My family has been taking our beloved animals here since 1993 when a breeder recommended them to us. Dr. Anderson is amazing, he tells it how it is and never tries to sell you procedures or stuff he doesn't think your animal needs. He has saved my cats life twice. After moving to Phoenix my cat got real sick with a uti, called around to vets near me and they wanted to charge me about 5 times what Anderson did... Needless to say I drove clear out to Tempe. The place can get a bit busy but you know that is a good sign! Please check out this vet for yourself. The prices are beyond fair and dr. Anderson is amazing.

This place really has EVERYTHING! I love browsing through all of the isles at all the different foods and buying new things. I also love to buy my sushi making supplies here. Why woudl I spend $10 for a bag of sushi rice when i can get is for $3 at Lee Lee;s? The only reason I did not give 5 stars is their lack of sushi grade fish, and the putrid fish smell (a sign of not so fresh fish). But if you can push past the smell this is well worth the stop!

Whenever I am craving decent italian food that is not the dreaded Olive Garden, we usually come here. The lunch specials are awesome and priced just right. I LOVE their lasagna, the sauce is homemade and to die for! But boy howdy bring your tums... I agree with some other reviews, sit in the bar area, much more chill vibe.

Dear Filly B's,  I have loved you long time, we were bff for nearly 10 years... that is until you gave me food poisoning. I will never eat carne asada again thanks to you. I knew we wouldn't last forever, nothing that hot and heavy ever lasts long.

The *ONLY* reason i shop here is because in an emergency  it is across the street from my house.. i usually have bad experiences here with customer service and other shoppers. This store is always busy with college kids because it's 2 blocks away from ASU, maybe that's why the customer service is sub par.  I have been accused of shop lifting because I brought my son and stroller in the store... I have had a cart full of groceries lock up mid shopping trip and nobody was able to help me because they couldn't find the key... so i had to transfer ALL of my groceries and a screaming child to another cart. I have bought expired yogurt here as well (that was my bad for not checking the dates).   The only good thing about this place is the sushi bar and the friendly sushi lady. She makes amazing sushi and is always happy to make you a special roll or two.   I will drive the extra mile to go to Frys where the customer service is awesome, friendly, and always willing to help out.

DONT EVER CHANGE AGAIN!!! Dear lord Sweet Tomatoes.. I am here to protest my undying love for you and your delicious veggies. We went to you weekly before you turned into the "Field Kitchen" (we call those the dark days). Now that you are back to your old self, we are ever so gratefull! We hated traveling to phoenix just to get our veggies on. Thank you for returning and updating your salad bar. I am in love with your cherry tomatoes and red peppers. Also nice to have the meat skewers and avacado!!! Keep up the great work :)

This is by far my favorite delivery pizza in Tempe, the quality is ALWAYS amazing and the ingredients are fresh. The crust is a new york style, and the slices are big. The chicken wings come in many different flavors and are very meaty and not fatty at all, they have those perfect chared crusty bits on the outside, and moist and juicy inside. The pretty much have something for everyone. I am a huge fan of their greek salad and calzones (easily feeds 2 people).. I can really go on and on about how wonderful this place is, but you need to experience for yourself.

What a letdown! Last Friday night, me and my family wanted to go out for pizza, we decided on Nello's because we haven't been there in YEARS. The waitress took our order right away, we ordered the cheesey garlic toast, house salad (no olives), and a thin crust cheese pizza. The garlic bread was so good, was the only thing I actually enjoyed. The salad came out and was missing all of the meat, it was just yellowed iceberg lettuce, carrot shavings, and a scant amount of cheese. We asked the waitress about the missing meat and she said she would bring it... it never came. The pizza arrived and was horridly undercooked, the cheese wasn't even melted in the middle! At this point i was just done, and super sad for my dining experience. We asked for our check and it took (no exaggeration) 13 minutes to get it. With two young kids this felt like ETERNITY.  She dropped it off finnaalllyy and we paid with a card. While all of this was happening there was either a regular or a local celebrity that was seated near us with his huge family. So instead of running our card she took their drink order, gave them their drinks, then took their food order... brought out their appetizer AND THEN RAN MY CARD. Shoot!!! took us close to 30 minutes just to receive our check, pay, and leave. Totally unacceptable, we will not be going back here :( The food was not that great, and the service was bad, not how i like spending my friday night.

I would order silvermine over Jimmy Johns ANY DAY! They have the best meatball sub....compared to Jimmy' Johns it is GOLDEN (never mind the fact that JJ's doesn't have hot subs...) They are always fast to deliver and the food is always great. My go to sandwich shop  **MUCH LOVE TO SM!*

I stopped here on a whim a few weeks ago thinking it was a semi-fast food place. It wasnt! Took me nearly 10 minutes to find a parking spot due to the overwhelming popularity of this place (which is a good sign!) I walked back to the takeout counter and browsed the menu and decided on the chicken shwarma sandwich, red pepper hummus, and a kids meal for my 2 year old son (chicken, broccoli, and rice). The lady at the counter was very helpful and full of suggestions. The food only took about 7 minutes to be delivered into my hot eager hands. I was surprised at the quality, it was very fresh and VERY good! My son ate all of his lunch and so did I. My only 2 complaints were:  1.) The prices were a bit higher than I would have liked 2.) The parking, oy!   But overall it was really good food and friendly service :)

I have had the Gus experience two times now. The first time it was a Monday night so I assume they wern't busy. The pizza was CHEAP and tasted pretty good. So here i sit, on a Sunday, we ordered again and it was HORRIBLE. There was no cheese, the pizza was cold, and the guy forgot our soda (we are still waiting for him to come back with it). I think our affair with Gus is over.  I will pay the extra 5 bucks at get Barros.

Our family loves oreganos! Their salads are sooo good and the pizza is to die for! My 2 favorite go to's are:   Alfredo the Dark pasta with chicken - Creamy and spicy alfredo sauce with big curly noodles, and a nice fire roasted chili on top.   Thin crust cheese pizza - Add some freshly grated parm and the red chili oil from the condiment tray on the table... so simple, but damn is it amazing!   But the most amazing thing ON THIS PLANET is the pizzookie.. when you get that first bite of warm gooey cookies, and cold creamy ice cream, you will think you died and gone to heaven. And it's free on your birthday!!!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is hit or miss with the services. 1/2 the time the waiter/waitress is amazing and totally on their game. The other 1/2 of the time we would wait 30 minute for our check, 20 minutes for refills, ask repeatedly for condiments or utesils. But being right across the street from ASU i bet the turn around there is crazy. And the parking lot it tiny, there have been a few times we circled and circled for 10 minutes and never found a spot and were forced to eat somewhere else.  All in all, amazing food at decent prices :) Highly recommend for families or friendly get togethers.

The food here is NEVER fresh, you can tell it all sits under heat lamps.. too many times I have ordered food without mustard or without mayo to have it slathered all over my order. The salads usually have wilted lettuce and a foul smell...  I now drive the extra few miles to go to the one on baseline and rural. I agree with the previous review.. they have let me down time and time again.

Love, Love, Love this place! Authentic middle eastern food and it is dirt cheap. Our family of 3 always eats for less than $20.  My favorite is the gyro delux sandwich, the feta is fresha nd sharp and there is a TON of it on the sandwich. The labne is usually made fresh every day except sunday. The homeade pita bread is warm and fluffy. There was one time we ordered chicken and it wasn't cooked all the way through so that would be my only gripe about this place. This isn't an upscale scottsdale d-bag place, this is a simple, fast, and friendly place to get your grub on.

Ah-Fricken-Mazing..... My friend had mentioned to me that this pizza place called "Spinatos" made a baked spaghetti calzone... Being preggo this sounded like the best thing EVER MADE! Last week i ordered one for lunch as take out. The guy who took my order was so nice, not the usual "I can give a rat's @$$" college student worker. When I picked it up ALL of the employees were on their game as far as customer service goes. The food...  it was very good. The crust tasted fresh and perfectly cooked, the spaghetti inside was tender, and the sausage was sweet and full of flavor. I can not wait to try their pizza! I will be back... very very soon.

My love affair with Trader Joe's started when I was 8. My mom would take me to this small, but packed to the ceiling store that was full of fun snacks and food, i loved it! Now I take my son here and he loves all of the organic and healthy snacks that Trader Joe's has to offer. I am also a HUGE fan of their freezer section, you can get everything you need for a tasty and cheap dinner, so those nights you don't feel like cooking the frozen food is a god send. Their pot stickers are some of my families favorites, pair that with the vegetable fried rice and orange chicken.. you have yourself a meal in under 20 minutes, and there are no preservatives or weird ingredients! I will continue to shop here for my hippie loving food, we are loyal customers and so glad there is a Trader Joe's in our city :)

This place is as good as it gets! Amazing selection, super helpful staff, and the prices on used books CAN NOT be beat. I used to shop at bookmans until I stumbled upon this place, the prices are 25-50% cheaper on used books. And if you don't find something you are looking for, the staff is always happy to help you find it or order it for you. I took a Children's Lit class a few semester back and I practically lived at this store on the weekends. They never let me down and I was always able to find what i needed, and on the flip side my son's book collection grew exponentially :)

I have been banking with DSFCU since 2000, and I can honestly say that I LOVE my bank! I hear my friends complaining about their banks and telling me about all of these problems, and I can't sympathize with them because I have never had a bad experience with DS. This is my main branch and I love it, the staff is always friendly and the drive thru is always fast!

As soon as we got here, I knew...this was a fun place for kids. Lots of toys, movies, video games. I had my 4 year old son and my 18 month old daughter (her first haircut)  and we got a super nice lady who made the experience so easy for my little girl. She did an amazing job and we got a little memento of her first haircut. I highly recommend this place!

So after living in Tempe for 5 years, I finally decided to drop in and check the place out. Total dive restaurant, but usually I have found, the dive restaurants usually have some of the best food. I have come here for breakfast now many times, their burritos are huge and flavorful. My only gripe is they use french fries for the potatoes in the burritos. If they made their own home fries in the burrito, I would dub them the perfect breakfast burrito. I have yet to try the lunch/dinner entrees, maybe one day!

I consider this MY store :) I have been shopping at frys since my family moved here when i was a kid in 86'. I have been a loyal customer because their prices seem to be the lowest, and the quality pretty dang good. So needles to say I have shopped at probably 20 different Fry's in the valley in my lifetime. I can honestly say that this store is by far my #1 favorite! The customer service here is unbeatable. From the person who greats you at the door and offers you an add, the guys in the produce department, the friendly smiles behind the deli counter, the butcher is amazing and will special cut/grind anything you need, and the smiling clerks in the checkout line who are ALWAYS happy to take my coupons. I am going to be so sad when we have to move away. If I could give more stars I would!

I think any costco has the same level of awesome customer service and products. This location is the one I have been going to for nearly 3 years. Their return policy is SPECTACULAR! Anytime I have had a problem with ANYTHING I have bought, they take it back, no questions asked, no hassle at all. There have been times I bought a flat of fruit, 3 days after buying it the fruit went bad and they exchanged it no problem. Also love their little food court, where else can you feed a family of 3 for under $10?! Great treat after an hour long shopping excursion :)

I could not be happier!! After many horrible experiences with plumbers, I was blown away by this company! It was super easy to make an appointment, the plumber came the same day for no additional charge. Robert Gault was our plumber and he was so nice and helpful! Was on time, fixed our broken toilet, and had it all done in 30 minutes. I would reccomend this company to anyone looking for an honest and reliable plumber... ask for Robert! You wont be dissapointed!

I had THEE worst customer service experience of my 33 years of life. It was so bad in fact, I don't care who knows how old I am. Last year our washing machine bit the dust, so I did my research and figured out the machine I wanted. Sears Outlet had it for the best price (nearly 40% less!), but it was a refurbished or a floor model, I took my chances and bought it. I eagerly awaited it's delivery as the mountain of dirty clothes kept growing. The day it arrived was a glorious day, it was all new looking and shiny. I ran my first load and within minutes of the machine filling up, the entire floor of my laundry room was 2 inches deep in water. I immediately stopped the cycle and turned the water off. I called Sears and after 1.5 hours on the phone being bounced around to multiple people, they informed me it was an installation error and the earliest they could send someone out was 10 days.... TEN, LONG, HORRIBLE DAYS. I begged, I pleaded, I even graveled with supervisor after supervisor who could care less. Ten days passed and the installation tech came to my house, looked at it for less than a minute and declared there was nothing wrong. I then started a cycle to show him the copious amounts of water draining out of the machine. He then declared that it was not an installation error, that it was a machine malfunction and I needed to call a repair man. SO back on the phone to Sears who informed me that it would be ANOTHER FLIPPIN 10 LONG, HORRIBLE, ROTTEN DAYS until a repair man can come out and see what was wrong. So 20 days of no washing machine, $40 of quarters later and countless hours spent at the laundromat, the repair man shows up. He fiddles around with it, and says the basin of the machine is cracked and was probably damaged during delivery/installation. There was nothing he could do.. the machine was 100% not usable. So back on the phone with Sears, many confused sales reps later, they informed me that they did not have a machine to replace it, since i purchased it though an outlet store, and all they could do was refund my money. I cried Shenanigans and BS, for two days I called and emailed every single person I could find, and eventually the head of the SW region called me and offered to replace it for free. Mind you it had been close to 45 days since the machine was delivered, 45 days of begging, pleading, and yelling at the Sears reps to listen and fix their mistake, 45 days of my life I will never get back! The day came where the new machine was being delivered and they were taking the old machine back to Hades where it belongs. The new guys took the old machine out and broke the water line coming out of the house.... they broke it... I started laughing because seriously, what are the odds? He must of thought I was a nut job, and you know what, after 45 days of dealing with the dregs of customer service, they created a grade A nut job. Luckily I spoke to their manager right then and there, but they were unable to repair the broken line until the proper paperwork was filled out and hoops jumped through. I told them to just leave, and never come back... We had a plumber come out the same day and fixed it for $50, best $50 ever spent.   To sum this all up, is it really worth the $ saved to put up with all that BS? No.. I learned a very valuable lesson, you get what you pay for, and Sears sucks!

As soon as me and my 2 1/2 year old walked through the doors... it was a comedy of errors.. or maybe not a comedy of errors, more like a freakin horrible epic drama of errors. It was our first time there and maybe my expectations were too high because I am so (well was) used to Jump and shout before they closed their doors.   Check in was a nightmare, 3 different lines going every which way, mom's getting ticked off at other mom's and their kids... Well we check in after 10 minutes of pure tantrum hell and make our way back to the jump room. Not sure what i was expecting but it wasn't what we got. The room was pretty tiny, had 3 huge inflatables, some balloons, balls, and inflatable sports things like a basketball and baseball. Well they crammed about 30 kids in there with all of their adult care takers, now I am not claustrophobic in the slightest but I could not maneuver through the sea of kids and mom's to find my own kid. I felt like a sardine in there!    Here is where the epic drama starts *cue horror music*  My son informed me he had to use the restroom, and we all know 2 year olds you have a 30 second window if you are lucky. So We dash out of the room like our pants are on fire, and open the door to the bathroom where it is flooded, water ALL over the floor. There was a little girl and her mom in there, she had slipped and fell in the nasty sewer water. So we both took our kids to the men's bathroom where I guarded the door.. then that bathroom started overflowing with sewer water... So by this time my son couldn't hold it any longer.. accident... I inform the staff there about the bathrooms, at first I don't think they believed me until they saw it for themselves... GROSSNESS!  (please note after my son's accident I did clean him up lol)  Well we headed back into the jump room and jumped a few more minutes then we were informed it was snack time.. YAY! So all 50 of us are herded like cattle into a small party room with NO AC.. sweaty toddlers, sweaty moms.. I could not stay in there for longer than 5 minutes so we went back out to the lobby area and waited. After snack time people started making their way back in the bounce room so we followed, only to be told we were switching rooms.. GREAT! A change of scenery.. so once again they herd us into the no AZ party room and the worker guards the door to make sure nobody leaves.. at this point I am starting to scope out the emergency exits and hoping to god I don't pass out from the heat.    After 10 minutes of sitting there... we are finally allowed to leave and go in the 2nd room, which I admit was SOOOOOO much better than the 1st, it was 3 times the size and the kids seemed to enjoy it more. We had a run in with one of the workers there who was extremely rude to a mom and a kid. The kid was somewhere he wasn't supposed to be and the worker grabbed his arm and yelled at him, which made him cry.. which in turn made the mom mad.. anyhoo.. she didn't seem to enjoy her job at all, which makes me question.. WHY ARE YOU WORKING THERE IF YOU HATE KIDS?!  All in all it was not a pleasant experience , only reason I gave 2 stars was because my son had fun, but we will not be going back there due to the price, facilities, and customer service. I read all of the 1 star reviews and shake my head.. how can a business survive when it treats it's customers like dirt?

After reading some of the not so stellar reviews, I was a bit apprehensive about eating here. When my party arrived we were promptly sat and drink orders were taken. We then looked over the huge sushi menu. They have pictures of every single roll they have, which makes it so much easier to order. All of the rolls I ordered were simply amazing! I had spicy tuna, might have been one of the best spicy tuna rolls I have ever had. Also had the Vegas roll...holy hell... Once again.. One of the best Vegas rolls I have ever had. The waitress comped one of my adult libations because she could tell I wasn't a fan of the drink and brought me a new one. Overall the service was amazing and so was the sushi. I hope people read this review and know this place is legit.

We ended up going here on a whim, we live less than a mile from it and drive by it daily. The menu was huge, the service was great, and the food was WONFERFUL! They put a twist on the usual everyday bar food and make things new and delicious. When we first walked in I was worried if the place was kid friendly, but it totally was, the kids choices were perfectly priced and portioned. We also came here with some beer savvy friends who were blown away by the beer selection. so all in all, we love this place!!

We visited chompies nearly every Sunday for 5 years. The food for us was really good until about 2 years ago, the quality started going down hill, I imagine it was due to the economy. We still went religiously, even though the food was hit or miss. About 4 months ago we went and I had the worst experience of my life. I ordered my usual, the eggs benny with smoked salmon... when they dish was brought out i could smell the fish, i knew it wasn't fresh. After arguing with the waitress she took it back and brought me a new one, which still smelled aweful, I took a few bites and couldn't finish it. 45 minutes later i experience the worst food poisoning of my life... I called to let them know to not use that fish, no idea if the message got to the kitchen... emailed them a complaint and never heard a word. All hope is not lost though! we found a new local breakfast place that we love, so maybe it is for the better. You will be missed Chompies....

Went here for the first time last week, and I must say, for a "dollar" theater it was pretty nice! I took my 2 1/2 year old son to a movie here and it was a decent atmosphere.   Pros:  - Fun displays and wax figures to look at before and after the movie starts - CHEAP! $2 Tuesdays! - The theater we were in was super clean, no sticky floors or garbage anywhere - Staff was amazingly nice  Cons: - Cash only?! boooooo - The movie we saw sounded like my head was in a  bucket for 3/4 of it  Overall it was a fun experience and we will be goign back soon :)

Met a friend here and was surprised! The ice tea was simply amazing! I got the london berry... Next time I will be trying the chai. Anyhoo, it is a bit pricey *BUT* this isnt a "let's stop here every day before work" kind of place. This is a place to meet up with friends, have some tea, and relax.  I was totally thrilled they have simple syrup for you tea... never have i seen a place offer that! Keep up the nice work and I hope to be back soon :)

One simple word for you.... BUN... This is my go to dish on a  hot summers day, my mouth is watering right now just thinking about the cool, crisp, deliciousness. Living in Tempe there are probably 5 Vietnamese restaurants within a 4 mile radius of my house, most of them are mediocre at best. So I decided to drive out of my normal Tempe hood and check this place out. I am the takeout queen... having an active 2 year old makes it hard for me to actually sit down in a restaurant and enjoy my meal, so I opt for takeout 99% of the time. I ordered the Bun with chicken, and a side of spring rolls. The customer service was awesome, the ladies were super nice. While waiting my son enjoyed watching the little koi pond they have. Back to the food.. It was very good! The bun was perfect temperature, the fish sauce was the perfect balance of salty and sweet, and when I asked for extra sauce they gave me a ton without flinching.  The spring roll were amazing, probably some of the best I have had in the valley. This is my new favorite close Vietnamese place, maybe soon I will try the pho since it seems to get pretty good reviews!

I am sooooo glad my friend recommended you guys! My cat (Sir Rufus of Tuna) was not feeling great and our regular vet was unable to squeeze him in, you were able to see him within 30 minutes of my call. Rufus saw Dr. Cortez, and she was AMAZING! She spent nearly 45 minutes with us giving Rufus a full exam, explaining everythign to us, and answering all my questions.  I couldn't be happier and I am happy to say we have found our new vet! Thank you again for the wonderful care :)

We have been coming here since my son was 6 months old (he is now 2 1/2) This is the one place we can come and i feel 100% comfortable letting him run around and explore. The entire museum is kid friendly and has something in every corner. My son's favorite attraction here is not the giant play kitchen, the 3 story climber, or the huge arts and craft room.. but the simple noodle forest. He loves to walk back and forth through them and hide. The prices have gone up since we first became a member, but I still think the prices are well worth it ESPECIALLY in the summer when it's 114 out :)

I was first turned onto this restaurant when I was 12 (I am now in my late 20's) or so and I have been in love ever since. My favorite dish off the menu is the Bun.. So light and cool and YUMMY! perfect for the hot summer months when a steaming hot plate of food makes you want to run away screaming.  The fresh herbs that accompany the dish are grown in the owners garden... i think they make a world of difference. This place is a dive, but is oh so worth it.

Three words for you...  MEAT ON SWORDS!  When you first arrive, they seat you to the table and explain the epicness that is about to ensue... First you take a trip to a salad bar.. oh no no my friend, do not turn your nose up at this "salad bar"... they have freshly made mozzerella, smoked salmon, asparagus... the salad bar is amazing. After you have your fill of the delicious mozerella and ripe tomatoes... the meat feast begins! Guys walk briskly around the restaurant with giant swords of meat.. yes... GIANT SWORDS OF MEAT. If they see your card is on green, they slice you off a big ole chunk of whatever meat you would like. I suggest the lamb, it is amazing.. every piece of meat i tried there was mouth watering and cooked to perfection. I have never been so full my entire life... This is a great place to celebrate your anniversary, or take that special someone out.

This place wasn't anything special, when we went most of their machines were broke and they only had 3 flavors to choose from, vanilla, some tart berry, and mango.... The yogurt was just ok, nothing stellar, the toppings bar was a huge mess and the place wasn't even crowded.  We probably won't be coming back here any time soon, i think it's location is the only reason why this place is still in business.

Don't come here with a list... Come here with a sense of adventure! I go here once a month to stock up on kid friendly snacks (cant beat 5 for $1!) and see what else the store has on sale or special. They put out a weekly add every wednesday with smokin deals. But like other reviews have stated, WATCH THE EXPIRATION DATES!   I would compare this to a yard sale, you never know what is going to be for sale, but you can find some pretty amazing deals :)

I come here a couple times a month for me and my son's weekly "ice cream date". The place is always clean and the selection of gelato is great. I love that all the fruit flavors (minus coconut) are dairy free and SO GOOD! Don't let the small sizes fool you, i promise a little goes a long way here.

Are all burgers created equal? NO! Lobbys does it simple, and right. There isn't anything fancy about this burger and dog joint, it's in a old strip mall in tempe where they don't get too much foot traffic, but don't let that fool you. Their menu isn't too big, but they do have choices for pretty much everyone, including a veggie sandwich. I get the burger when I go and it is thick, juicy, and cooked to perfection.  My only gripe is they don't have a kid's menu so I have to order a $5 hotdog for my kid and he only eats 1/2 of it.

I love this place and so does my 2 year old son. We would come here after a morning having fun across the way at Jump and Shout (may you RIP) They always have a wide variety of yogurt flavors and the toppings are ENDLESS!  From kid cereals, fruit, nuts, to fresh baked chocolate chip cookies. It is also a huge plus they the toppings are neatly organizes and CLEAN. They can be a bit on the pricey side but if you sign up for their mobile text coupons or fan them on facebook they are ALWAYS having specials and daily deals for the frugalistas out there.

I got there just before they were closing, the guy working the counter was a bit unhappy I could tell... I apologized and told him I was only ordering one thing, wasn't too helpful with recommendations, but alas.. I am adventurous! I ordered the jerk chicken... Holy crap it was fall off the bone good! The red beans and rice were the best I have ever had..I actually wanted to lick the styrofoam container..but not wanting to get tongue cancer I begrudgingly threw it away. I would recommend this little gem to anyone wishing to try something new!

I am beyond thrilled with our experiences at this office. After 4 years of putting up with a horrible dental office, this place seems like disneyland! Everyone was so amazing with the kids, from the receptionist, the hygienist, and the dentist. All were very patient and super friendly. If i could give more stars i would. Thank you for your hard work and changing the way my kids see the dentist.

We used to think the world of this dentist office, until they took our money and 4 weeks later still have NOT received our refund.  In February after paying $1200 down payment for my son's braces and after the 2nd appointment they deemed him "not ready" for braces and 4 days later we had our $1200 back in our bank account. Once the contract was closed and canceled, they did not turn off auto pay for the monthly payment. So on March 15th, we had a payment deducted from our account which sent our account in the negative and caused several overdraft fees. I immediately called and they took full responsibility and said they would pay the money back, including the NSF fees caused by them. Well after countless phone calls, emails, and jumping through hoops, they released the money on 3/28 back to our account, 13 days of arguing and pleading... Well here it is 4/14 and we still have NO REFUND in our account. I have spent 20 hours of my life trying to recoup the money that was stolen from my account. They sent me a receipt and told me it was sent, and that is all they could do, they couldn't track it or put in a request for an audit.. nope.. I had to go to my bank and file fraud charges against them and hope maybe in the next 2 weeks I will see the money.   Josh the office manager is condescending and of no help whatsoever. If he gets involved in your case i guarantee nothing good will come of it.  I am in tears over all of this.... I wish their billing customer service matched the service of the dental staff.  I no longer recommend this office and all of my friends and family know about this horrible situation.

We used to do our weekly sunday breakfast at Chompies.. that was until I got serious food poisoning from them and vowed never to go back. This left me and my family in quite the pickle... we love local breakfast places but hate chain restaurants. One morning while driving around to find a new breakfast spot we found Mark's... tucked away in a little corner of a strip mall. As soon as we walked in i could tell it was going to be good, the customers were so happy, and the employees were super nice. The food is simply amazing, chef Mark is a wiz in that kitchen. Everything I have ordered from here I would eat over and over again. My favorite is the hollandaise, it is the best I have ever had!! I recommend this place for anyone looking to break out of the restaurant rut.

This place reminds me of an upscale restaurant in Vegas. The decor is big, monochrome, and simple. The menus IS HUGE, it took me and my family about 15 minutes to finally decide on what we were ordering. The kids menu had some of the best choices I have ever seen. We ordered the bruchetta and it was soooooo good, probably some of the best I have ever had. I got the goat cheese, spicy meatball, and a mozzarella one. Then they bring out THE BREAD, this bread is sooooooo simple but soooo good (I think we went through 3 loaves). After we were stuffed with all the bread and appetizers, our meals came. We got a thin crust spicy sausage pizza, and a roasted pancetta brussel sprouts pasta. Both were knock your socks off good. My kids ordered the mac and cheese, and even that was amazing. Overall a great experience and great food, my only gripe was the prices. Our family of 4 was nearly $100 (2 kids meals, 2 adult meals, 1 appetizer. 4 drinks and 1 cocktail) so this is a once in a blue moon kind of meal for us. But a great experience none the less.

WHAT?! No idea why everyone is complaining about the smell, it smells like any other thrift store! This is my favorite thrift store in Mesa, they always have high end kids clothes (gap, hurley, etc) in EXCELLENT condition for super cheap. Every day there is a special, Tuesday is 50% off EVERYTHING!

We have been coming here for 4 years, and have watched the slow decline of this office. When we first started coming here the waiting room had video games, toys, and books. My kids loved it! Slowly the toys disappeared, then the video games, and all that was left were 3 books that were destroyed. Of course we tried to overlook this, as we were there to see a dentist and not play games. As far as dental assistants go, you better hope to god you get the only nice one of the bunch. Most are unitfit to work on children as they have ZERO patience for wiggling, crying or fearful children. The one nice assistant is amazing though. The dentist is always nice and patient and willing to answer any questions you may have, that is the only reason i gave 2 stars.  The very last time we were there, my 6 year old son had a horrible experience that has now made him fearful of dentists. He was having sealents placed on his back molars, simple right? Well after 2 hours, a bruised mouth, and missing tooth he would beg to differ. He got so worked up because  the assistant kept trying to shove a huge rubber thing in his tiny mouth, and after i repeatedly asked if there was anything else she could use she got snippy and told me to leave the room.... NOPE... i didnt go anywhere, i asked HER to leave, and i then tried to calm down my son when i noticed blood on his face and a missing tooth.. where the tooth went i still have no idea. She came back in with a smaller and less intusive device after trying for 30 minutes... why she didn't get it when i asked multiple times? I will never know.. as soon as she got ready to start, another assistant popped her head in and said the dentist wasn't here yet and to stop until he arrived. So she took it all out and off and left. We sat in that room alone, for another 30 minutes waiting. FINALLY she comes back and starts all over and the job is done in another 30 minutes. She was very rough, unprodessional, and mean.  After the ordeal my son begged me to never take him back there and i promised him i never would. We now have found a new dentist for him and they are 20x's better.

Wow! I am wondering if we even went to the same place??! I have been here 2 times, each time was amazing. There are a lot of people working there yes, but I assume since they just opened they are training as many people as they can before ASU opens. The sandwiches are priced amazing $5 for a toasted sub. The bread is a chibaata hybrid that is chewy yet soft. The milkshakes are some of the best shakes I have ever had, hand scooped and the little cookies they put on top are a perfect combination. Speaking of cookies, the oatmeal chip cookies are soooo good! Come here for good sandwiches, amazeaballs shakes, and freshly baked cookies. You can't beat the prices!!!!

Ewwww dude... This wasn't very good. After taking well over an hour to deliver food on a Thursday night.. It was cold, soggy, and not appetizing. I ordered the sesame chicken, which was really sweet and sour chicken sprinkled with sesame seeds. The crab puffs were soggy and under cooked. The only things thought was decent was the egg fried rice.  I have yet to find a decent delivery place in tempe, and this makes me sad :(
