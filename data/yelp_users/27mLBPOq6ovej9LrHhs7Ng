I can't believe it has taken me this long to write a review. I've been going to Cherry Blossom since my High School days...   Service is definitely a hit and miss. Majority of my visits have been a miss, but if it wasn't for the food I would have never returned.   The Nabeyaki Udon is one of my favorites and I'm sure it'll be yours if you come check out this place! Try to overlook the slow service and take in the good food. It's amazing! You'll leave forgetting how bad service can be because you'd be too satisfied.   Don't forget to go next door and treat yourself to SNOH for dessert! It's the best thing ever... Literally ever.

Saigon Pho is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant!  I've been dining here for nearly two years now and love this restaurant dearly. My boyfriend and I dine here two to three times a week. The food and service continues to bring us back, and our love for Vietnamese food continues to grow! I've practically have had just about almost everything on the menu and have not found many items I did not like.   The beef salad is amazing... to die for! It is served with your side of white rice, with  lemon salt and pepper dipping sauce. Believe me, it is fantastic! You will fall in love and come back for more. Not forgetting your traditional Pho, something that is a must have and try! You cannot go to Saigon Pho and not have Pho... rice noodle soup with beef and beef balls, served with sprouts, lime, and basil leaves. There are sauces to add to enhance the flavor. Once everything is added, you indulge!    Some of my other favorite dishes are; the special crab, clams with basil, and steam flounder.  They cost a bit more if you don't mind splurging a tad to enjoy the taste of how each item is well put together. These items are normally shared-so for the price, it is worth feeding at least two people.   Beside for the seafood items, everything else on the menu is affordable and decently priced. Nothing is overly priced for the amount of food served. The servers are extremely friendly, quick and nice... I've gotten to know almost every single one of them to the point where it is a little embarrassing when I walk in and they say, "Wow.... you come here again?!"  There are never any long waits and most of the time, we are sat right away. They come by so often to check on you... So basically it is impossible for your drink to be half empty. Good deal, eh?! I have and will continue to enjoy this restaurant. So if and ever you are in Chandler, Arizona make a quick stop here and give yourself a decent meal you won't forget!

I'm absolutely surprised to see some bad reviews on Yelp! My boyfriend and I have been there a few times and we absolutely love how intimate and friendly the atmosphere is. We are always greeted by the owner with a friendly smile. We've sat at the tables a couple of times and sushi bar once and have always received excellent service by our server and others who come by to pre-bust our tables. Al, the sushi cheft is just absolutely wonderful! Very passionate about the art of every plate that comes out... Literally a piece of art!   Although it is a small restaurant, my dine-in experience has alway been pleasant. Very pleased with the service given. Most of all, the atmosphere is very intimate and that's what I most love about this place. Oh... And happy hour is everyday from 5-7 can I say AMAZING?! Hallelujah! Finally... A restaurant that has happy hour everyday!   The quality of the food is worth every dollar spent! I rather give my money to an authentic-good quality-freaking awesome-small business than a massive chain with no quality and intimacy. If you have gone here and did not have a great experience, then I would just say, it is worth another try and I promise you won't regret it.

Let me begin by saying I'm usually a huge fan of Fleming's. I've gone to the Scottsdale and Lincoln location quite a few times, and have received nothing but stellar service each of those visits. Tonight, I cannot say the same about the Chandler location.   Let's begin by Brittany (our server) coming to take our drink orders... It took close to 20 minutes (18 to be exact) to receive our drinks. We hadn't seen our server and was wondering where she had went, so we had asked a near by server if he can find out where Brittany was because our table was ready to order. Long story longer... A girlfriend of mine had ordered a $155 bottle of Caymus, the server had her sample it, and my girlfriend told the server the wine needed to be filtered. Brittany disregard what we had requested and poured it into a glass pitcher (can't think of the name for container she poured the wine in) and never came back. We finally had to tell the young gal that was helping Brittany serve the table we wanted the wine to be filtered because of the sediment. This gal kept challenging us... Stating why didn't we tell Brittany this in the beginning... And we told her we did, but she never came back to do it. Mind you, there was 3/4 of the bottle left, it was not like anyone drank the bottle and demanded anything for free. My boyfriend who is in the restaurant industry... A GM of a restaurant in North Scottsdale would not have let something like this slip without touching the table. No manager came to touch on the table as this was an on-going challenge of the night. This went on for the majority part of our visit until we watched the manager  go into the wine cellar with our other server to grab another bottle we had requested.   Point is, no one touched the table. Despite of the challenge for the night with the wine, you would've at least expect a manager to come by because no one had taken responsibility for such poor service we left quite disappointed... Can't expect a decent tip if you do not receive decent service. I think holding yourself ACCOUNTABLE is a major issue at tonight's visit. No accountability whatsoever. I highly suggest someone in charge reading, 'Leaders Eat Last'. It's a great read on leadership.   Tonight's visit left a really bad taste in my mouth. Very poor service! Brittany did not return to our table as she left it for the other gal to take care of us. I know how intimidating and frustrating it can be to serve, because I myself have served for 5 years while going through college, but at a place like Fleming's I don't see why you cannot be successful when all the tools you need are right in front of you. Being in the service industry isn't for everyone, it takes a lot of patience, and customer service skills. You work in this industry to be of at service to people no matter how bad a night is going.  Do not have any reasons to return.

We ordered dinner for pickup from here last night (11/30) and had a really good experience thanks to missy at the register (don't know her name). My guy and I thought about eating there, and we would've if it wasn't so busy... It was ok tho, we enjoyed dinner at home with our puppies.   Ordered soup, salad, pizza and Mac n' cheese. Total came out to be slightly over $25. What a steal! Apparently, Sauce has a special going on for the holiday season where you buy a $25 gift card and you'll get $5 for free! I LOVE FREE!!!! Missy at the register suggested we get the gift card to use towards our dinner and that way we'll get $5 for free. Had no idea that was going on if it wasn't for her, and we absolutely appreciate her taking really good care of us. She was very sweet, smiles a lot, and seems to really enjoy her job! She radiated a lot of good energy for being up since 4am.   I've been here many times and each visit has been very pleasant. Food is great, service is excellent EVERY SINGLE TIME! Thanks for always being on point. We love our neighborhood, and the restaurants on this side of town. Thank you for always taking such care of those that take care of you, Sauce!    P.S. I would really like to recommend the winter roasted vegetable salad, it's the bomb! Mac N' Cheese not my favorite. Other than that, Sauce is a great place to enjoy dinner and it's good on the wallet too!   Happy holidays!

I've been to the Urban Tea Loft four times now, and all four times it has been an awful experience. I guess I continued to go because i wanted to support the restaurant and I understand the meaning behind the tea concept, and admire the owner for the fight against cancer.  Let me be honest by saying the food is decent. Mac and cheese is great... SERVICE is extremely slow... Give me a break...we were 1 of 2 tables there.... At the start of the morning... Can't be busy when there's only 9 tables and ONLY 2 were taken up.   My guy and I ordered bloody mary's... First let me say, there wasn't  any garnish and there wasn't any seasoning in the drink! It was pure tomato juice. Second, we ordered... I ordered French toasts, and my guy ordered the ribeye skillet...I waited ten minutes after I placed my order to check in through yelp... We waited 37 minutes not including the 10 i waited prior...and still no food... So I walked over to the server and politely asked for the check and they kept saying "are you sure you want it.. Your food is really almost out" you kidding me.. Almost out?!  Uh... Let me think.... No crap... I would really like it... Basically she never did what I asked.. Instead she came back with the food... The ribeye...was raw... I ate my French toast cause I was so... hungry! but give me a break... Absolutely no comp on anything... Manager nor the owner didn't even come out to apologize... How ridiculous is this?!!!   I don't like to write bad reviews, This is actually my first...and forgive me for grammar but I just am still so annoyed. I gave this restaurant the benefit of the doubt and every time they have let me down. No excuse for poor service... We paid full price for everything, absolutely nothing was comped and it was obvious I was upset, but wasn't rude.. I just simply said "I'm sorry, but 47 minutes is a very long time to wait for French toast, so we would like our check and pay for our drinks..."And I still tipped 20% ask me why?! I have no clue... I've been a server and in no way would I ever let my customers leave unhappy.. I would apologized, get their food comped, get a manager and make sure if they do ever come in again they will be well taken care of. No excuse for such poor service... The Restaurant wasn't busy... I crap bricks when I left!  I don't recommend to eat in.. Maybe order togo, but that's it. The $40 I spent on breakfast I could've been in and out stuffed at BLD. No thank you for the 5th visit... This place really pinched my nerves... 4 visits and each visit has always been extremely slow...restaurant is too small to be overwhelm when the restaurant isn't even full... 2 servers for 9 tables... Please don't tell me it's too much to handle. Well, I will never return here again... Those who have gone here and have gotten great service and didn't have as long of a wait for food.. GOOD FOR YOU! They need customers somewhere and somehow.

I would like to say I read a list of reviews before trying this restaurant and surprised to see it got so many bad ones.   Once greeted at the door, sat within a few seconds and our server came to us within a couple of minutes. Food was fairly priced and delicious. They are extremely generous with their serving size and the potatoes are great! Overall, customer service and cleanliness of the restaurant was very good!:) The only bad thing is they just keep it cool enough to be seated and once you drink your coffee it becomes a little warm! I say that's the only area that would need a little improvement.   I would definitely return for another breakfast date. Great food, great ppl and great service!

Had dinner here this past Monday (11/23) with some of my staff members to celebrate my boss's Birthday. I couldn't get the server's name, but she had long dark hair tied in a pony tail and has what most people would consider an unhappy face. Absolutely an unpleasant gal to even talk to. The moment you responded back to an attitude that was given, she tried to pull that reverse psychology role and make it seem like.... "I'm sorry but I have no idea what you are talking about"   At the beginning of service, my boyfriend and I had simply asked and requested for our meal to be on a separate check as we felt it was uncomfortable to have the Birthday man pay for our dinner. Just a simple request... She had said Gary (my boss) had already pre-authorized his card and she cannot do that. What is this.... A club? We had asked and simply requested something as simply as that and she challenged every single bit of it. Finally said she would, and needless to say she came back at the end of dinner and said she couldn't do it because her boss told her she couldn't. What planet do you live on when someone ask you, "please put my dinner on a separate tab because today is the boss's birthday, and we do not feel completely comfortable with him taking care of our meal."   I totally get that my boss wants to take care of our staff, but when another person or I should say two people show up to surprise and wish him a happy birthday, it is uncomfortable and awkward that he ends up paying for our meal. I'm extremely disappointed that something as simple as that was challenged. She made it so much more difficult than it had to be... Come on girl... This isn't rocket science!   I think a lot of people lack the understanding of human communication, and maybe I should've signed for her. Worst part is, the manager/owner Zorn never even touched the table. For as dead of a place it was you would've at least thought the owner would come over to greet and check on one of the only tables that gave him business that evening. This is suppose to be a quality restaurant with quality service. I give Monday night's visit an, eh!   Tommy V's might be a good-looking restaurant but it is slowly declining for sure. Nothing good going on here! Drive a little further up North to Local Bistro and see the difference in Service and food. That place is on point!

Went to TEN for Restaurant week this evening and left completely satisfied. It's amazing how much better food taste when service and plates are perfectly executed! Jeff the owner (and Cheft) came out and checked on us multiple of times. I can tell not only is jeff proud and take good pride in himself, but he gives all the credit to his amazingly wonderful staff. I can't say enough positive things about our visit tonight... And to have met such a humble person as Jeff, gives us all the reasons to come back!   We ordered one of each item from the restaurant week menu, and each was perfectly designed to fill your tummy with warmth. So happy we chose this as our first stop of Restaurant week.   Thank you for giving us the Midwestern hospitality! All the best to Jeff and his staff.   Please come here and share the same experience we did.
