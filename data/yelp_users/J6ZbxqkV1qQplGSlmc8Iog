The only thing worth the money here is the thai iced tea. I have NEVER spent $30 and walked away starving! Needless to say my husband and I will not be going back.

We have been here twice now and love it! The food is fresh, the price is right, and the owner is super nice and accommodating. They also have great gluten free options, which is hard to find at an affordable price point - I personally loved the Thai peanut steak bowl! We will definitely be back and plan on recommending this restaurant to everyone we can.
