I own a 03 Toyota Corolla. Thanks to Ron Jr. I will have her for some years still to come. Ron is always honest about what my vehicle needs.  No up sales or bull. Very dependable work. Which means a lot when you're driving around 3 kids. Thanks Ron!

I have been coming here for a year now and recommend it to everyone. The guys are better with hands. The lady techs are better with feet. Unless it's 'Tony' or 'David' who are excellent with both. All the people complaining about tips are just rude people. These guys live off their tips just like anywhere else. They have always been very friendly and polite to me. I have seen some rather rude customers in there. It's sometimes hard to smile at people that are mean to you to begin with. Having worked in customer service before, I understand this. It's called the Golden Rule.

I came in today because the usual place I go was closed on Sundays.  I was very impressed with the color choices,  how clean everything was and how comfy those chairs are.  I'm only giving 4 because I came in with the intention to get the deluxe pedicure and it was 4:00. They close at 5:30 on Sundays. They were fairly busy, so by the time they started it was 4:30. The deluxe is about an hour.  The gentleman doing my pedicure seemed annoyed when I told him what I wanted.  Although I do not speak their language, I read body language quite clear.  He looked upset and kept looking at his watch and complaining to the employee next to him.  At first I was upset because I thought it was a little rude. It's not like I came in after 5 wanting this.  But then remembered we all have bad days.  He really did an excellent job though.  So I tipped very well and told him I was grateful he had the extra time for me.  His attitude did a 180 and he said he really hoped I would come in again. I plan to try this place one more time after this experience.  Over all I was pleased though.  I like the quality better where I go, but the massage and the works included seemed better here.  If only they could combine.  Haha

If you don't mind waiting for 3 hours and then being cancelled on.  Only to turn around the very next day and wait another 2 and then have to call another company, after the manager guaranteed PERSONALLY  only 10 more minutes... by all means...  Use them.   They are HORRIBLE!!!!! After reading all the reviews, I have no clue how they are still in business.

I have been coming here for the last couple years.  I love these guys.  If there is something wrong with your nails just tell them so and they fix it.  It's so close to home and the prices are very affordable.  Will continue going for years to come. :)
