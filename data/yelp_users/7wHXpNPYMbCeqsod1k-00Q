BEST CHIPS AND SALSA/BEAN DIP IN TOWN!  Among the great food the service is good too! Always getting refills on drinks and chips. We come here regularly! Great spot!

Showed up for dinner around 6:45. Table wait time was only about ten minutes. It was a table for 2. Once seated we were almost immediately welcomed by our waiter Tyler. (Which was petty darn quick for how busy it was). And just like that our drinks and appetizers were in. And soon followed our order for dinner. From the fried calamari to the Fish and fries and the club sandwich everything tasted great! Dessert was also delicious. Beer was cold and the atmosphere was good. Everything turned out great and Tyler made sure that we were taken care of.  If you are in the Desert Ridge area and are looking for a bite to eat or even just a beer or two, I highly recommend this Yard House.

It is date night with my wife. We have never been to this restaurant. We were seated promptly and that's where any service (I mean none) went out the window. We waited patiently for 15 minutes while we watch people entering after us get starved drinks. Our waiter/waitress was non existent. So after 15 minutes we threw in the towel and went down the walk to a different restaurant. This was my first and last visit to Bj's.  *(No star actually)
