I had spotted this place a couple of weeks ago, apparently new in my neighborhood.  I got a combo with one crispy taco, 2 quesadillas and three rolled up tacos covered with guacamole, cream and cheese... Only 8 dollars, which also included a drink.  Anyways, the food was great, it was fresh and very tasty.  I will definitively come back and recommend.  The staff was very nice and service was quick.  I'm glad Se√±or Taco is so close to my place. As an update, today I stopped by again, two weeks after I had drafted this review... Guess what, I think the food was even better this time.  I've found my favorite Mexican food in Glendale so far.

The one star is for the staff.  Year after year I fill out the same stupid forms, I'm talking about 6 to 8 pages.  You'd think they'd have you in their files after 5 years of being a patient.  My doctor is great, otherwise I'd be happy to be seen somewhere else.
