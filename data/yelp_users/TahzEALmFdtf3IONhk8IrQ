For the good: beer is cold, great TV's and the food is not bad BUT for the service OMG every single time it gets worse and worse. It is TERRIBLE and every time we go there are new servers. I have been told many times the turnover of employees is because the management is awful and they treat their employees BAD!!!!!  Time to STOP supporting This place especially because there are SO many great sports bars with great staff!!!!!

So very sad how this Zipps has gone so down hill!  Terrible service and food is just as bad now. Corporate office has to step in and fire all the mgmt and start fresh. Won't return to this Zipps for sure

Ok let me start by saying I HATE HATE HATE going to Dr's offices. So when I needed to see a GYNO my friend said you have to try Dr Glassman. Well I did and all I can say if this was the BEST Dr experience I have EVER had. The entire office is great and the DR wonderful. I can't say enough good things about the experience. Thank you!!!!!!!  Hands down the best Dr in Arizona

Ok so this great new place opens right by us and I was so hoping it would be good. Well it is AWESOME. Amazing food but really the services puts it above all the rest of the ice places. They go way out of their way to make you enjoy.

Finally writing a review after my third visit!  Twice for lunch and once for dinner. AWSOME food and love the patio. Rachele was our waitress and she honestly was probably the BEST server we have had!  Great personality and amazing service. Food is so fresh and drinks are great too. Can't wait to go back!!!!!

So sad cause I so wanted to have fun Saturday. We all decided to try the new spot in Old Town before meeting our friends for dinner at Eddie's House. Well NOT a good idea. Sad but we will not be back EVER. Too many great spots in Scottsdale and terrible terrible terrible service

Loved it. Came for lunch today. It was busy but the staff is AWSOME. For people saying they are confused on the ordering system I am not sure what they mean???  We sat down and had a great waiter. He was super jealous and did a great job. We all lived out food and I LOVED the Kale salad with chicken patty. Excellent. So for us it was a great value and we will be making this a regular spot.
