I have never been able to complain about anything I've ordered from here. Sometimes the dudes confused 'fries' with 'rice', but it's not like I especially NEED french fries. Prices are reasonable. They have a drive through.  One day I bought an Adobada burrito from Rivas and I swear to God it was THE BEST burrito I have ever had in my life. The pork was perfectly seasoned / perfect temperature and the tortilla was just perfect. Ugh. So good. Carne Asada is always great at Rivas. If you're into Carne Asada fries get them here.  The chile relleno isn't the best I've ever had, but definitely the best in comparison to small taco shops like Los Favoritos or Filibertos.

A buddy of mine brought me in here right after I turned 21. That first time at The Woodshed I saw an old man bring in sledge hammers and drunkenly attempt to kill two men. I've found myself going to this bar ever since.

Great local establishment. Whoever said the owner is rude probably caught him on a bad day because he's usually very friendly. The souvlaki is amazing. Place might not look so aesthetically pleasing or even on the best side of town, but the food is killer and reasonably priced. OH! and the falafel is great too.

worst Adobada I've ever had in my entire life and I will never eat here ever again.
