Good food. Busy place. I had a chili size and my hubby had a grilled pastrami.  The chili size was good, not great. It was not quite hot enough. Fries were yummy. Servicer was pleasant.  Looks like a lot of regulars come here as it was always humming.

If you have a party larger than 8, do not go here.  We had a party of 12 for tonight and they said they could not accommodate us together (one of our party from tonight said she had gone here before with a party larger than 8 before).  One of our friends said she was told by a manager that if it were not a Saturday, they could accommodate us, but not on a Saturday because they are just too busy.  When our family comes to town we are a party of 11.... guess we cant go here with then either.

We came in to have lunch today and have a wonderful meal. What happened to another party really me made me appreciate this location. They had a party of 15 come in and they opened up a section that was closed to take care of them. Now that's customer service.

I went in today to have a previous root canal checked out.  I really feel that if you have to have a root canal, this is the place to go.  Not that I am excited to have one by the way, but at least the staff and Dr Hales rock.  I call myself his "problem child" since I tend to be a nervous nellie about my teeth.  I have been in the dental field for almost 30 years and would go no where else to have a root canal done.  They are fast, kind and professional.  When I was an office manager in a dental office and had to refer patients here, they were always accommodating and we had wonderful reports from our patients.  Dr Hales made himself available for emergency phone calls and was very kind about being disturbed on a Saturday night.

We had our scooter and lift serviced this morning and the restaurant was in the same shopping center.  This was our 3rd time there and it was awesome as always.  Good service, fresh food and yummy fluffy pancakes.  I tend to be a pancake snob and can not stand heavy thick pancakes, these were light and fluffy.  My husband had the breakfast skillet of steak, eggs and potatoes.  He loved it.   There menu said their soups are all made from scratch daily, but we have not been there for anything but breakfast.

My husband and I have been patients here for over 5 years. We chose them because they are close to our house.  It was a great fit for our family. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable.  I see Dr Wood and my husband sees Dr Williams. I am not a fan of the glaucoma test and Dr Woods knows that and he goes the extra mile to help me get through this test.  I highly recommend this practice for your eye care needs.

My husband and I were hungry for tacos and we really enjoy Nando's.  It was a beautiful night so we sat outside on the patio.  Yes.....me....I sat outside.  LOL   I don't care for real hot salsa and theirs is perfect for me.  Their shredded beef is flavorful and moist.  The only negative I have with this place is every time I have been there the wait staff is not a friendly as I would like and they do not make eye contact.  That is a pet peeve of mine.

Went for a late dinner tonight.  The waitress seemed a bit scattered but was so nice we really didn't care.  I had the Chicken Parmigiana and was it HUGE.  We have enough for 2 more meals.  We don't come here often, but always enjoy it when we do.

No one will ever hold a candle to Discount Tire in my book.  My family have been loyal customers for over 20 years and will NEVER go anywhere else.  Good, honest, quick service.  Clean waiting room, nice technicians, lots of choices and no pushing to buy the most expensive tires.  I wish all businesses ran like this one.  And it is a local AZ company.

It was our first time at the restaurant however they did cater an event we attended at Christmas time.  It was very busy and we were told the wait was 30 minutes.  It was 45 min to 60 minutes however, so plan on the time frame given being off.  The food both then and now was wonderful.  I has the cheese pizza.  It was fresh, flavorful and nice NY style crust.  My husband had fettuccine alfredo w/chicken.  The portion was large and he said it was very good (he is a man of few works)  The rest of our party has the coconut shrimp and the penne w/sliced meatballs.  Both were very much enjoyed.  For dessert we had caramel creme brulle and cheesecake.  both are made on premises and very fresh and flavorful.  We will most certainly be back as there are other items we want to try.

If I could give them a zero I would. They flat out lie to you. Called them on it and they wanted to know what they could do to fix it and there is NOTHING short of a FREE CAR that would make me trust them again. and even then I am not sure.

One of my "go to" spots for pizza.  Had a wonderful afternoon with good food and drink with a wonderful friend.  It was quiet because it was Sunday so we had a great opportunity to catch up.  The small ceasar salad was fresh and large enough to share.  The BBQ Chicken pizza was amazing as always.

Movie time!  We went to see "Chef"  what a great movie!  The food this time however left much to be desired.  I always have the Thai Bang Shrimp Tacos and this time the corn tortillas were old and dried out, and there was almost no shrimp to speak of.  My hubby had the Coconut chicken tenders and he did like those.  The rest of the experience was good as usual and this will not prevent us from coming back.  I just may ask this time if they changed the recipe.

I saw this restaurant on Check Please AZ and decided to give it a try. I made a reservation as there were 4 of us annd I knew it would be busy because of the show. We were sat immediately and our server came quickly for drinks and brought tri-colored chips and salsa.  She then took our order. We all ordered the stacked enchiladas but each a bit different from the other. Now for the not so good stuff.  About 15 minutes later she came back to us to say she forgot to put in part of our order and needed to verify everything that was ordered. So we gave her our order again and waited.......and waited........and waited. Finally, after waiting over an hour, our food came.......and did it was AMAZING! Each enchilada had a generous amount  of meat, and the green chili sauce was sooooo flavorful. They all came with rice and beans.  The waitress came by again to ask us how the food was and to apologize for the wait. Along with our table issue, there was a party of 14+ that came in just before us and they threw off the reservation schedule.    Despite all the issues, we all want to go back again as there are other items on the menu we want to try.

Dessert and coffee for me, dinner for Rob.  Really busy, but then it is Friday night.  The projected wait is only 10 minutes.  I need to remember a slice of cheesecake to bring home for Mom.  I had the Lemonchello torte and Rob had a Cuban sandwich.  I do like the atmosphere here.  I like the dark lighting in the evening.  They have a new menu and they finally have a lower calorie menu.  I guess after all the bad press on having the highest calorie items on any restaurant menu EVER, they finally got the hint.  I would like to go back and try some of the under 550 menu items.

First time here.  The place was clean and cozy.  We decided to split the Turkey Pretzel sandwich as neither of us were real hungry.  When we got up to the counter to order I saw they had whoppie pies.  Well, I have never had one before so we bought 1 and shared that too.  The sandwich was real good and I really liked the pretzel bread.  The manager came over to see how our meal was and even chatted with us for a bit.  There isn't one near us here in Mesa, but if we are on the west side again we would defiantly go back.

I have torn ligaments in both knees and can not get on my knees to clean anymore so I decided to hire a cleaning service.  I found Carnation through 2fixit.com.  I chose them because they are close by, send in the same team at each cleaning and they are licensed and bonded.   They sent in a team of 3 for 6 hours of straight work!  THEY NEVER STOPPED!  They brought all their own cleaning supplies ... even the vacuums.  The staff wore blue booties over their shoes the whole time.  My house hasn't looked this good since I moved in 10 years ago.  My Mom who lives with us (she is 92) was thrilled with the results.  She loves how clean her bathroom is.  I am going to be a regular from now on!

First Trip here via Groupon.  The whole experience was just great!  the food is fresh and you get A LOT for your money.  I had Pad thai which is my favorite.  I liked the fact you can adjust your heat level.  I am a woose and I had a 2 and it was just perfect for me.  And I had leftovers  YUM!   My hubby had chow mein with beef at a lever zero (he has tummy issues with spice).  He too enjoyed his meal.  We will definatly be back.

This was the most disappointing night here at this location. The waiter was unfriendly, never smiled and acted like he was mad all night. Beverages were not refilled for some of our party and I was never even asked if I wanted another margarita. Oh, and the margarita was watered down and I could not even taste the premium tequila that I ordered. the only thing that was good was the food. Yummy as always so at least the kitchen staff rocks. We will never return to this location again as our experience each time has gone downhill.

First time here.  Looking forward to trying something new.  The place is real small and they are in the process of looking for more square footage.  That's a good thing as they were out of some of the menu items (because they have been "crazy busy"  Well I have to say I had the best BLTT I have ever eaten.  Fresh bread, lots of ingredients, very flavorful.  The owner is  really very nice.  He came over to every table and asked how their food was, and I feel he was generally interested and not just going through the motions.  I am looking forward to going there again.

If you want to work with a great company and great great service, look no further.  Our 16 year old home needed new sunscreens and I had no idea who to call, so I went on yelp and found great reviews for this company.  I called and hey set up a free consultation and measuring of windows.  Seth came out and was extremely professional and kind.  NOT PUSHY, just informative.  He gave me a quote and went over all our options and even told me about a SRP rebate that I did not know about.  They said 10 days for manufacturing, but it was only 7.  The screens were installed yesterday by Steven and hey look great.  I am  hoping for some energy savings as our old ones were pretty bad.  I would highly recommend this company to anyone and everyone!

The atmosphere was as expected so no disappointment there.  The wait staff was friendly and upbeat and gave menu suggestions.  I chose the chicken wings and my husband had a bacon cheeseburger.  The wings were small and dry...almost no sauce.  The little bit of sauce they did have had good flavor though.  The hamburger according to my husband was very good 1/3 lb with lots of french fries.  Unless we are going with other people or for an event, we wont be back.

Time to try a new breakfast place.  This place is rockin.  It was 3/4 full when we got there and when we left there was a line waiting.  Our waitress was a hoot, and the owner came by to check on us and wanted a true opinion of the food. The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable.  My fave for breakfast is pancakes and theirs did not disappoint.  Light fluffy and yummy.  A short stack is enough for 4 so be careful when you order.  It is open for breakfast and lunch only and next time would like to try lunch.  You gotta try this place!

I was real happy to see something going into that building and I am so excited it is TQLA.  The place was busy, but we were seated right away.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable.  Come to find out she is studying hospitality management.  They have 2 kinds of salsa to go with the chips.  One tomatillo with pineapple which was too hot for us.  The red roasted one was hot but not too much so.  We had to wait a bit for our appetizer, but no big deal as this was their first Saturday service.  We had the nachos for appetizers.  They are served tostada style and were fresh and flavorful.  For our meal we had steak fajitas for 2.  Good cut of meat and cooked to a medium / medium well.  Served with black beans, pico, guac, queso fresco, lettuce and a corn rice.  We chose the corn tortillas and they had a sweet flavor to them.  Well after all that good food, the waitress came around with dessert suggestions.  We chose the 4 Leche cake with a marshmallow meringue.  OMG!  So decadent.    We defiantly will be back!

It has been a while since we have been here but tonight we were celebrating the awesomeness of my husband! Our waiter Justin ROCKED and we had  the steak Fajitas for 2 again and I think they were even better this time than the last time. I am now forever spoiled for fajitas. the meat was sooooooo tender and flavorful, I could have had just that and been happy. then to our surprise Elsie our waitress from our first visit 3 years ago came over and REMEMBERED US AND WHAT WE ORDERED!!! She is now almost done with hospitality school and LOVES working here!!!  And it shows. She is no longer a waitress and I am not sure of her title, but she ROCKS TOO!  We had an amazing night and we decided we need to come back more often.

Cute place. Our first time here.  They start out by giving you fresh bread and olive oil w/balsamic vinegar for dipping.  Yum!  Rob had a bacon and pepperoni pizza,  had a meatball calzone.  Very good, light and fresh.  The place had a consistent flow of customers, which to me says something.  We defiantly will go back.

First time but not the last time here.  Great food good service.  Down home cooking.  I always have to try the pancakes when I go somewhere new. So i had the eggs, pancakes and bacon combo (my usual). The pancakes here are flavorful and filling.  Not as light as I like, but not so heavy they weigh you down.  I also had to try the biscuits and gravey and was not dissappointed.   We will be back, net time for lunch.

Wanted to give there cupcakes a try.  I have to admit they are not my favorite. The cake was very crumbly and had only a slight amount of flavor.  The cream cheese frosting was gooey and messy.  I really don't feel they are worth $3.00 a pop.  Just my opinion.

I have been seeing Dr Renee for years for spinal maintenance but today was one of the times in my life where I needed her for an injury. I fell and landed full weight on my left hand and ended up in the ER with an injured left shoulder. Dr Renee has been an important part of my healing process. I felt better after my first visit with her, but today was a MILESTONE! When I went in there today I felt I was at about 50%.(day one after the fall was 0% to set the gauge). After my treatment today, I feel like I am back to 75% of my normal self.  Dr Renee..... you are a blessing!
