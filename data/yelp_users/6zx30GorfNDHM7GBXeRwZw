Simply the best in Phoenix.  Bought a German Chocolate Cake w/ Mocha filling for my Wife surprise Birthday Party and it was hit with everyone!  The female clerk also recommended I buy Red Roses for my Wife and White Roses for all the Ladies attending!  Score!!

Went there for lunch, it was good.  The owner gave me a sample of some deep fried red snapper with creamy white sauce, Great!  It was a lot cheaper than other places, but hey it's still sushi  Ordered spicy tuna roll and tuna, both were very tasty!  Nice staff

Great place for Pho in the SW Valley!  I go there for lunch the Pho has a great taste, beef is tender and rice noodles very good, plus the broth is yummy.  Only problem it's close on Tuesday.
