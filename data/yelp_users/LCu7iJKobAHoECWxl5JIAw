A friend and I went to Spices yesterday on Ray/McClintock. We ordered back to back and were put on the same delivery table number. We ordered the exact same thing. It was lunch time busy, well my friends order came out first, then 5 min, 10 min, 15 min goes by my order never came out as bus boy is delivering other peoples orders. Not only do we not have time to wait because its my friends work lunch break, but I am so irritated I dont even want it anymore so I go inside for a refund. I am in a short line and the bus boy comes to ask if I need anything, he is oblivious that I had an order, mine was clearly lost. The guy at the register who I believe was the manager or owner himself, was so upset that I wanted a refund, he said he was not going to apologize and didn't feel he owed me an apology because it was busy and I should expect to wait. I said well we ordered together, he said it didn't matter, and couldn't I see how busy they were. He so rudely voided my transaction and was a total JERK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Awful customer service.  Went in just now to get a mattress for my son. No one came out to greet us or help until I had my son get up on a mattress to see if it was comfortable. Finally a man appears to tell me he has to get off the mattress? Not a "hi, how can I help you?" No, so rude. I'm going to spend a couple thousand on a bed, and he can't see if it's  comfortable? BYE.

The service was bad, there was no food quality check. We ordered a lettuce and tomato taco, wait, I mean a chicken taco, but there was hardly any chicken. Also ordered the nacho's, the sour cream was M.I.A. My water was never refilled. The waitress dropped off the check. I immediately put my card in, and she made several passes before we had to stop her and ask her to take the check. Not at all impressed, will not be back.

My problem is with the service. We had a party of 5 including my son who is 2 1/2. The waitress came and we ordered water for everyone, plus I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir (all other adults also ordered mixed drinks). I didn't order a specific one and the waitress didn't offer a specific one. First problem, she brought 4 waters. She did not bring my son a water. I had to ask her again to bring him a water. Second, when the bill came, oddly named item with a charge of $15. We discovered it was my glass of wine. She supposedly brought me the most expensive one on the menu. When asked if that was the cheapest glass if Pinor Noir on the menu, she said yes. It was not, there was an $8 glass. I would probably come again if I were in the area because the food is good, but I would definitely hope to not have the same server.

My husband and I went to Del Frisco's last night to celebrate a special occasion. We sat upstairs on the patio. Very nice. The food was good but somewhat too pricey. Also, we ordered 2 shots of "chilled" tequila. What the server brought was way too watered-down "anejo", Hardly any true semblance of a what we expected, but with a couple of Stellas, we didn't want to complain. When the bill was dropped, we were shocked to see a charge of $30 for the "chilled" shots! Dude took advantage of us. Don't think we'll be going back.
