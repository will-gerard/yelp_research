I remember hurricanes. Then I remember nothing. So they must have been some pretty good hurricanes.

We actually found this place by accident. Their $3 mimosa & bloody mary sign lured us in, and I'm glad it did. We almost turned around when we noticed that we were the only car in the parking lot, we have learned in the past that there is generally a good reason no one else is eating at a place and its best to skip it, but the cute little historic house was just too inviting. We decided to take our chances and it paid off with a couple of perfect bloody marys for me ( extra spicy please) and some bubbly delicious mimosas for my hubby. We split the eggs benedict with chorizo and green chillies because we weren't all that hungry. It was great the chorizo wasn't all greasy and the flavors were really good. And the side of fruit it came with wasn't slimy! The freshly balled melon and grapes were crisp and sweet. The prices were really good and the staff was amazing. We will definitely be back for brunch and plan to try their lunch & dinner too.

Adorable. Really, so cute. The wait staff does their best to pull off the retro vibe, red lips and high ponytails.  The soda counter is covered in flavored syrups, any flavor you could dream of they have. Came in to split a banana split with my hubby, I know right?  Gross. This place does that to you though.  It all whip cream and cherries and "isn't that bobby so cute". The split was good, the price was fair, and it was a fun little time traveling experience.

Pane Bianco is Pizzeria Bianco's younger brother.  Not as much hype makes for little to no wait with the same great food.  It's proximity to my house makes stopping by to grab a Biancoverde pizza and salad for dinner easy, and it never disappoints.

Every time we've been people have been friendly.  There's a camaraderie.  A Cheers-esque feeling if you will. Important in any neighborhood bar.   I've sampled the fish and chips and Shepard's pie and have not been disappointed.  Service has been good, quick and efficient.

I like sunUp.  I like the beer, its good, I especially love the IPA.  Oddly enough, I have yet to eat at SunUp.  I just really like that this is a nice place to kick back and have a cold one.  The services is consistently quick and friendly, and the selection is great.

We needed a break from St.Patties festivities, and some food, and one of my fav yelpers Nader suggested CherryBlossom. You can't beat this happy hour.  A beer for under $3, various appetizers for $2, $3, and $4.  Nader raved about the spicy gyoza hot pot, so freaking good. I got the tantan-men, spicy noodles with minced pork.  I like pork in all it's forms, and this was good.  I'm a sucker for ramen, and this is a great place for a fix! The sushi, was ok, not show stopping. Great place for happy hour!

This was my first elite event! Very exciting stuff. And you know what?  It totally rocked.  The Capital Grille staff was amazingly friendly, supper accommodating, and really just top notch. The food was so so good.   The tenderloin sliders?!  Are you kidding me,  I couldn't pass them up every time a tray came around I was snatching one up.  And they came around often.  We were fed well at this event. I think my husband had around 17 of the tiny coconut creme pies, I don't blame him.   And since I lost rock paper scissor and got stuck with DD duties for the night, I really appreciated the nonalcoholic options, the grapefruit soda was great.   But it was hard to stay away from their signature drinks they were serving up.    Great event!  Thanks Yelp!  Thanks Lindsey! And Thanks Capital Grille!

OK. I realize that I look like a huge softy with the stars but I really do love postinos. My world revolves around their bruschetta. I mean, ricotta with dates and pistachios (!) Most amazing thing ever. The apple, brie, and fig spread is pretty spectacular as well, not that I've found one I don't like. The wine, sangria, and prices are all good. The only thing that tends to be lacking is the service, but only in speed. I'd say they need a few extra hands but that would just add more bodies to an already packed house ( I have never seen this place slow) so I'm perfectly content sitting back and waiting. Give yourself some time if you plan to visit, just sit back and relax, when your server does get there they will be friendly, the wine will be good, and the bruschetta will be delicious.

I absolutely love this nursery! I am very new to gardening, and know next to nothing about it.  So, after starting our first garden my husband and I ran into a few problems.  We went to whifill because it is close, and berated the friendly gentlemen working there with all of our questions. Whats this? What are there holes in our herbs? how can I get rid of the weeds? and so on.  He answered all of our questions, offered solutions, and made suggestions.   We walked away with some very effective weed killer and now I know what all of the random things growing in my yard are!  Prices were fair, staff was excellent, I'm certain I will be back.

I am here twice a week to drop off work clothes. They are always quick and friendly, love the guy that's usually in front. Prices are good, and I have never had a problem with their work. Ive had comforters cleaned for $15, not bad, and yesterday dropped off two pairs of pants, one of which needed the hems on both legs sewn, for a grand total of $11.

So... I have a last minute check that I need right now.  My bank wants to put a hold on it, understandable, but I need the money now.  So, I have to find a Bank of America.  I walk to one nearby my school, they can't do it.  They suggest I go to this location.  I high tail it over there.  They close at 5:00, its 5:03.  A very kind woman is locking the door as I rush up.  The woman at the other branch had not mentioned that they close at 5:00.  I slump over, defeated.  Game over.  Then this angel looks at me, turns the key the other way, opens the door, and waves me in.  In shock I babble off my story, "Didn't know you close at.... really appreciate it... sorry for the hassle... omigod I love you..."   She calms me down and takes me to a teller, who was also kind.  Cash in hand I left, crisis averted.  Bank of America, the employees at this location are saints.  They saved my life, or at least my GPA as that money went  towards desperately needed school books.    This branch is now on my Christmas card list.

Really Sakana?  I haven't written a review about you yet?  How could I not?  Well, no time like the present.  My family has been frequenting this find establishment for some time now.  Back when it use to be half its current size and we dreamed of the day when the blockbuster next door would follow suit and shut its doors.   Well, they did, and Sakanas expanded.  There is ALWAYS a line at the front door right before opening.  But don't be turned off, this is no two hour wait, they ALWAYS open on time, and there is ALWAYS room.  You will be promptly greeted, sushi bar or table?, and then quickly sat.  Your server will be friendly and prompt.  My husband loves the iced green tea, my parents always get some Kirin and sake.  Now you get a discounted appetizer with those beers, may I suggest the jalapeno boats with a sweet dipping sauce, so yum. Your regular menu will have some entrees, some sushi, some salads.... Haven't had any of the entrees, but the miso soup and their house salad are both excellent.  Now lets get on to what we are here for.  Sushi.  As you walk in next to the hostess stand there will be three of their specials out on display.  They all look good, and guess what, they all are.  Get them, get them all. You will also notice the white board behind the sushi bar. The sushi bar filled with lively talented sushi chefs.  Making delicious rolls, cracking jokes, and maybe taking a shot from time to time.  One most likely purchased by one of the guests at the bar, they share a round, a toast, hey we are all friends here! Back to that board.  There's a list of sashimi, as well as some rolls.   Your biggest challenge of the night will be narrowing down what to order.  Again, they all sound great, and they all are. They do a great job with the simple and an equally great job with the more complex.  They aren't all pop and sparkle like some of those other sushi places, where you can order that super duper tri color are those pop rocks,  is that deep fried, holy cream cheese rolls.  I mean, you can get that, and it will be good, a flavor explosion if you will.  However you can also get a nice sliced piece of fresh delicous fish, with some fresh wasabi root.  And you know what, the price is fair.   Your get quality here. And say hi to Yoshi.  She's the manager, the one with the big smile.  She will stop by, and she will be warm, and funny.  All the staff is.

Seriously to be avoided at all costs. The folks at this dealership are the stereo type of sleazy car dealers. My husband and I stopped by early in the afternoon, we were greeted by a saleswoman named Dee, who was courteous. We said we would return later that day, no problem. Unfortunately when we returned Dee was busy with another customer, apparently she is the only person at this dealership that works. We were instead handed over to a hefty man who did not introduce himself. We asked for the price on a blue Mazda sitting right out front to which he replied "Well which one, we've got a ton of blue Mazda's". Wrong my friend, you have one, its that bright beacon of blue in front of these big glass doors, but OK whatever. We walk over to the car where he tells me that the 96 ford Taurus on the lot would be a better match for me. Great, well, I'm asking about this car, not that beater. Finally he agrees to tell us the price of the Mazda, and we ask to talk prices about it and a truck for my husband. When we go inside he walks into the fishbowl with his sleazy manager and they both come out and tell us they wont tell us prices on the cars until they run our credit. We say we wont give them our information until we know whether or not we can afford the price of the cars, and they proceed to tell us its federal law. BS. We told them bye, and I called 2 other dealerships to confirm the crazy story they were telling us. I called back and asked to speak to a manager. I got the sleazeball, and told him that I was very upset by the poor service and the lies I was being told. He said he really didn't care, because that's how they run their dealership. Well, my friend, if that's how you run it I'm sorry to tell you, you wont be running it long. And he refused to give me his supervisors number, but don't worry, ill find it.

I love Gabriel. He does an amazing job every single time I'm there. I generally get two peekaboo highlights put in, and a cut and style, and always leaving looking great. His attitude is always upbeat, it would be impossible to spend any time in his chair and not leave in a good mood. The salon is always clean and comfortable. I never feel like I'm being forced into spending more money or buying product, but when I have a question about what I should be using in my hair Gabe always makes excellent suggestions. I have recommended him a good friend and my mother and both love him. My mother even left her stylist of 10 years to start going to him because of the excellent service he provides.

Best happy hour ever. Really.  I had been to moon before, but it has been years.  When I was younger and worked at a near by restaurant we would stop by after closing.  My memories are hazy.  Recently I needed a half way point between me and some other bridesmaids to plan a friends bachlorette party, and The Moon was that point.  Two pints of blue moon, one bud light, and one rum and coke, $9.  Thank you Happy hour.  Really $9.  So naturally when my husband and I were on that side of town and could go for a cocktail and some bar food The Moon was on the top of my list.  He had a crown and coke (not on happy hour) two rum and cokes that were and I had two blue moons.  We also had some sliders and some gooey cheesy tater tot appetizer.  The food was good.  What you would expect.  This is a bar, not a gastro pub, but the cheese wasn't rubber.  The service was friendly, atmosphere nice, and the drinks are cheap.  I think this trip set us back just around $30.  Pretty awesome.

Since our first visit to new york my fiance and I have been obsessed with finding a decent new york street style falafel sandwich here. We have learned its all about the tahina sauce, very important. And a nice crispy on the outside ball of falafel, not the grainy or soggy stuff you tend to run into here. Well after a few complete failures, I'm looking at you pita jungle, we have found what we believe to be the closest possible substitution here at greek wraps. Their falafel is spot on, crispy out side and moist inside, and they're tahina sauce is wonderfully reminiscent of that with which we would drown our sandwiches with in new york. On the downside there is always a wait to order, despite being rushed when you are at the counter.

We are really lucky to live so close to this place. These guys are great.  Very friendly, very knowledgeable, and their prices are fair. We went in shortly after moving into the neighborhood, we have two fairly new beach cruisers, my back tire was a little wobbly, and my husband needed a light.   They looked over both of our bikes and let us know what they needed, aired up the tires, and set up an appointment to true up my back tire, it was done on time and for a good price. They also upgraded my husbands bike light for a better one, really nice of them.

This place is dark, divey, cash only, and most importantly walking distance from my house.  The drinks are cheap, and well made,  I agree with the posts about Aurora, shes the lady, but all of the bartenders I've met so far are great. There are hand written signs all over the bar, there pool, tiny bathrooms, and when I'm hungry I can walk over to fry bread house and grab a bite to bring back with me.  And there a juke box.  I'm a sucker for a juke box.

I've been hearing about fry bread house for awhile now. So when I moved into my new home and found it right next door to my neighborhood dive bar, which does not serve food, I was understandably excited.   You know what you need whilst drinking cheap beer? greasy food.  This isn't greasy bad, like dripping and wet, this is good.  This is fluffy warm fry bread, with delicious spicy chorrizo, and all the fixings. The prices are good, the staff was friendly and quick, and the food? oh yes, I  will be back. Also, the leftovers with a fried egg cracked on top, a great breakfast the next morning.  really.

Its taco bell.  That's all to be said about the food.  However, this particular taco bell has THE friendliest staff of any fast food place I've been to.  They are always upbeat, at first it's off putting because you are so accustomed to the person handing you your greasy food through the window being lackluster at best. Eventually you realize that they really are just this nice. I have never had someone roll their eyes or impatiently take my order. No, they are always happy to serve you. I've even had one fine gentlemen become concerned for my well being when I ordered a volcano burrito but no beverage. He wanted me to know it was very spicy. He continued to worry until I let him know I had a water bottle with me.  Really.  Nicest. People. Ever.

My sister in law made an appointment at this shop today.  She had scheduled a time, spoke to a sales person over the phone about price and preference, and filled out their online survey as well as up loading pictures of dresses she liked.  Despite all of this nothing had been pulled, and she was asked the same survey questions there.  The sales associate told her to look through the racks to find something, but at her budget she would have a hard time.  Ok.  Fine.  We will do the looking despite having provided so much information, that's not a big deal.  However the fact that the bride to be asked about selection and was told there was plenty, and now apparently none, sucked.  There were maybe 20 dresses in size 6.  But the sales associate repeatedly told us the problem was our budget.  We couldn't find a dress we liked at any price, to be honest these looked second hand or like they were from sample sales between 10 and 15 years ago, but the sales associate continued to repeat that it was our budget that was the issue, not their crappy selection. Not a good experience, not a good shop, crappy attitude and crappy selection.

Let me set the stage for you. It's a wednesday night. My brother's girlfriend's 21st birthday. Started off at saddle ranch, where 14 of her friends stood her up. Sucks, right? This poor girl is left with only her mother, her boyfriends, and her boyfriend's sister to celebrate this momentous occasion. Spirits were low.  A change of venue was needed.  She chose Blue Moose because she liked the name. It's a nice looking bar.  Laid back. Clean.   Hey! There's shuffle board! She likes shuffle board. But shuffle board is not enough to turn that frown upside down.   No, only a miracle would save this night.  Enter Derek, AKA the most amaizing bartender and possibly greatest human being alive.  He saved what started off as a disastours night.  He was elated when he found out it was her 21st.  He carefully planned what her first drink would be, asking her what flavors she liked.  he suggested fun shots, other great spots to hit up, turned the night around.    Really, without him, this would have been the absolute worst 21st birthday in the history of the world.  We will be back, because not only is this a nice bar, but the service is truly unbeatable.

Let's face it, Scottsdale can be a real pain in the ass. Dress codes, pomp, and general douchebaggery are not uncommon in this town. Sometimes you just want to sit down and have a beer, sans all the nonsense. Coach house is your place.  There's a reason this rickety wood building is so popular.  Especially it's done up in tacky christmas lights! I It's easy, and fun, and super low maintenance. Two bars ensure you are not waiting forever to fill your glass, and the addition of a food truck out front makes satisfying the beer munchies super easy.

I was brought here by a couple of coworkers a few months back.  We split some fries and had some peach ale.  One co worker went on and on about their mac-n-cheese, so I have wanted to go back.]  One lazy Sunday I thought taking my husband to watch some football would be fun as he had never been and I had been dying to see what they have to offer.  You'd think taking a guy to a bar to watch sports would be easy, but the guy complained they whole way there.  It was busy, parking was a pain, which I'm told it always is, but we were sat right away.    We ordered a peach ale and a hob knot ( I love you hob knot)  and his mood began to change.  Then we perused the menu.  Holy delicious options!  We decided to choose two delicious sounding dishes and share.  We decided on the Popper burger, so so so good, and one of their breakfast specials, the name of which escapes me, but consisted of beans and eggs and beef and tortillas and was gooey and delicious.  The atmosphere was fun and upbeat.  The service was great!   In the end my husband is lucky I am such an awesome wife and we are all lucky four peaks is such and awesome Arizona brewery.

They have Lagunitas IPA on tap. So  yeah, there's your 4 stars right there.  On top of that they are on my bike route home from school... so convenient. Super plus, my bartender kept my drink full and get this, didn't ignore me.  She was funny, and friendly, and really made my day. So yeah, I'll be back.

My husband and I were in the market for some sweet cruisers.  Tempe Bicycle was out first stop, I fell in love with an adorable little number with green rims, and my husband found a couple he liked too.  The two fine gentlemen working were wonderful, answering any questions we had and allowing us to give the bikes a spin.  Since these types of bikes have a fairly hefty price tag we left to look at a couple of other shops before making our final decision. After visiting competitors it was clear that Tempe bike shop has the best selection and prices, we high tailed it back there and purchased our two bikes and accessories.  Great price, Great bikes, Great customer service!

This is near my parent's house.   I like my parent's they are pretty cool people, and this is their bar.  Due to proximity and I'd guess little else. If I show up when they are there, my beer is free.   This is why I go to Top Shelf.  The service is hit of miss.  Sometimes the glasses are kept full, sometimes our part of the bar or our patio table is a barren desert that no one ventures to. I'd say it's and 50/50 split.   The chips are the standard free chips.  Sometimes we get the cheesy spinach dip, which is good, but nothing special to see here.  I really like my parents, and the free beers (when we can get them) so as long as they keep going, I'll keep going.

There was talk of a Lobster claw machine. I suspect that, and the low low price, is why my husband chose this pit. First impression: the parking garage, how are there shoe prints on the celling? Then onto the elevators.  Small. clanky.  It's and older place, no biggie. Enter to the 'lobby' old old carpet, old old wallpaper.  To be expected, its an old place.  There is a bar up ahead, oh that's nice. Oh, it's shut down.  And covered in dust.  Some temporary looking walls create a massive box in the  middle of this area, it seems to house old machines.  That's odd.  I guess they are under construction... or something? Check in is back behind the elevators.  It takes forever.  Up to the room. We call for more pillows, don't expect delivery.  Walk your happy butt back down to the lobby and get it yourself. I am now confronted with the reality of the room.  This is where I will be sleeping. Sometimes, you just do not want to know.  You  touch as little as possible and sleep on top of the sheets.  It is now clear, booking here was a terrible mistake. And you know what's good when you are drunk? A toilet that doesn't work. You know what's better? Needing water, remembering the soda machine near the elevator... oh, its out of water... and Gatorade... and soda... its out of everything.  So you go, to EVERY floor.  Guess what? they are all out!  Hungover me loves multiple consecutive short, jerking elevator rides, and disappointment.  It seems someone is unable to pay the Pepsi guy. My guess: this joint is going under.  The casino sucks, the infamous lobster claw is gone, though I can see exactly where it was as I'm guessing they haven't vacuumed that spot since it was removed.  The bar is shut down, the restaurant is shut down, the only think open is a place to buy jerky.  Jerky.  Good god this place is bad.  I wont miss it. We spent as little time as possible here.  We spent most of our time at the newly renovated Plaza, where the Casino doesn't suck, the restaurants are actually operational, and our friends got a killer room for barely more than what we paid.

They have some great specials.  Monday nights mani's and martinis, their fabulous drag show on Tuesdays I believe, and a bottle of wine and pizza for $20. Their drink menu is.... extensive.  I don't know how to order because it is just too much information, so I give myself over to the mercy of the bartender and what I get is delicious every time, thanks Anthony.

I really just can't get it up for this place.  It wasn't horrible, but was also nothing exciting. It is a lovely place.  I have walked past it a few times and admired its beauty.  It is clean, and crisp and bright. Really really nice.   Also small.  Not good for groups at all.    The drinks were really good too.  I'll give 'em that for sure.  Unfortunately the food just doesn't live up to the decor. I had the Oriental grilled tuna and my husband had the burger au poirve.  Both were completely boring.   The fish was grilled fine... the sides were completely lack luster... the only thing with any hint of flavor on my plate was the wasabi.  I like it hot man, but that green devil paste was (to my complete and utter shock) the hottest wasabi I have had. I kept trying to liven up the blandness of my dish with the hell fire paste, but alas it was either too little and drowned out by the soy, or the equivalent of 100 tiny Chuck Norris' round house kicking my sinuses. I could have used little red riding hood to sniff out that just right amount she is so fond of.    My husband was equally unimpressed. I just don't see a second trip in our future.

This place is romantic. Seriously.  Reese Witherspoon movie romantic. Housed inside a lovely old home.  Nice little garden out front, with twinkling lights strung over head.  If you recently messed up with your lady friend, a bottle of wine on this patio and prior transgressions will be forgiven. And you know what? The food is good! Really good.  All fresh, home made pasta, fire oven pizza's, everything made with care and attention to detail.   Parking can be a hassle, but worth it.

This was between an a-ok and a Yay! I'm a fan. for me. My husband was definitely a fan, he had the tangier burger with sweet potato fies.  It was good, especially the fries, he said it was the best burger he has had in a while. I had the fez burger, while I wasn't as smitten as my husband it was good, the spicy harrissa fries are awesome.   His burger was on special and we both had the grapefruit vodka drinks they had on special, making the price of the meal pretty awesome, I'm sure this is playing a large part in my husbands love for FEZ.   Our server was MIA after our food was dropped, which is sort of a service pet peeve of mine, but waving down another server who was happy to help was not at all difficult. Overall good food and good price, we'll be back.

I've only been here on St.Paddy's.   On a day like that, an irish bar can be a huge cluster.  We have actually tried some out on the west side that do the whole tent and stage thing, and it was a disaster. McCaffrey's pulls it off nicely. This will be our new tradition. Sure, getting a beer isn't as easy a normal day would be, but those bartenders busted balls to get to everyone at their bar.  They had a tent running full swing as well.  The lines were kept pretty short and I was able to keep my glass full which is what's important in life. I recommend sitting on the patio if you can swing it.  Great people watching.   We had a lot of fun, and while there was a cover it wasn't completely ridiculous, and since they had thier crap together it was worth it!

I feel like I should right two separate reviews here. One for the mojitos, 5 stars, easy. And one for everything else, 2 starts, easy.   The mojitos are delicious, so many flavors, each one better than the last.   Everything else.... well.  My husband and I sat at a bar table. The place was busy. Our waiter took a bit to get over, no biggie. I had ordered a sangria, and he brought me a margarita, he realized the mistake before even setting the glass down, gave it to me to sip on, and went and grabbed my sangria. Very nice. After this things took a turn.  We ordered our appetizer and entrees. The trip of dips for a starter, the street tacos for me, and the grilled burrito for the husband.  I am fine with paying for chips and salsa, especially the trio of dips, which were really good, but can I get more that 3 tortilla chips? Maybe?  It took about 20 minutes to get the app, no trouble, we are enjoying our drinks and the atmosphere. But after we finish we wait nearly 45 more for our entrees. Our server is understandable busy, and is able to keep our drinks full, but that's a really long time to wait for food.  When it does arrive my street tacos are fine, my husbands "grilled" burrito is just a cold burrito. I suggest sending it back to be reheated, but he is unwilling to send his plate back to that black pit, who knows when it will be back.   So, from now on, straight to the bar for some drinks, down the street to one of the many fabulous Phoenix restaurants for good.

We have ordered Harley's to go twice now.  It's close to home, so It's convenient for the nights we want to stay in but don't want to cook. The first time we were kept waiting for about 10 minutes while our pizzas got cold in the window.  The bartender was busy, so I get it, but it still hurts to see your food sit, waiting for you. The pizza was good, not great, I think there is definitely better around. The most recent time we ordered a few appetizers. The antipasto plate was a little small.  Nothing too exciting.  The Fig bruchetta was good.  The oragnine di patate were really good, especially the Gorgonzola sauce served with them, I recommend this.  My favorite for the night was the Arugula pear salad.  Really good.  I am just between 3 and 4 stars here, I'm not quite there yet, A solid 3 and 3/4, so I'll round up on that. I feel like it's a little on the pricey side for what you get, and nothing to date has really blown me away.  But maybe it requires a dine in experience to get me there, and I am more than willing to give it a try.  The place is nice, very laid back and a little romantic.

I hate you wal mart.  Your employees are an elusive bunch.  They leave me wondering if there are secret employee only portals that they dash into just as I spot them to ask a question.  Your cashiers break my eggs in my favorite yelp reusable shopping bag and cant identify a single vegetable.   Its a cucumber!  I'd understand you befuddlement if it were a kumquat or starfruit, buts its a cucumber.  And about that produce, did you work out a deal with Fry's to pick up their stuff just before it turns?  By the time I get it to my fridge it is a soggy sad picture of its former leafy self.    And for Christ's sake why can I NEVER get EVERYTHING on my list?  I am making beef stew, not stocking the basket for the next episode of chopped.    My husband thinks you are more convenient, because he can pick up the latest as seen on TV gadget, socks, little Debbie's snacks, and motor oil all in one stop, but since we ALWAYS have to go to another store he's wrong.  This is a fundamental disagreement in our relationship, one that I blame on his mother, and every time I leave your store I feel like my husband and I are one step closer to divorce.  You consistently provide me with nothing more that a headache and a sad sad picture of my fellow man.  And brown lettuce.  I hate you.

My fiance suggested this place after driving past it on the way home from work. We stopped by on Sunday night and I'm really glad we did. We were seated on the patio, which was lovely. The whole place had a warm feel and was beautifully decorated. I can't wait for it to get cold enough for them to use the big fire place on the patio. Our server was friendly and efficient. We ordered two cocktails, I had the sweet strawberry basil caipirinha (yum) and my fiance had the cucumber cooler (something we wouldn't have ordered if it hadn't of been a suggestion on here, it was wonderful, big thanks to the yelper who suggested it!), I will say, $9 for a drink is a little crazy, so next time we go it will be during happy hour when they are only $5. The house baguette was warm and delicious, I LOVED my pumpkin soup, I suggest you get it before its gone, the pomegranate seeds in it were a pleasant surprise. The fiance had the chile burger, also amazing, though it did come out a little under cooked for his liking, no problem, the server took it back and it was returned quickly and cooked to death, just the way he likes it. We had a great time, and will be returning, Hopefully for breakfast next time.

this time we shared a craft of house wine, like it a lot,  and the goat cheese appetizer, liked that a lot too. The boy had the pork chop and it was melt in you mouth tender, about and inch and a half thick, and absolutely wonderful. I had the seafood cioppino, loved it. Ive seen some complaints about the soggy bread, but I loved it. I left it for the very last so it could soak up all the amazing broth, it was still slightly crispy on the edges, but gooey from the cheese and broth in the middle, it was the perfect end to a really great meal.  Service was good too.

So.... your saying if I spend and extra couple of bucks on a reusable cup I can take my drink into the theatre with me? Seriously? But no, Really. Yes, yes yes a thousand times YES!  Give me that fancy cup so I can enjoy book of mormon with a cocktail in hand!  Why doesn't EVERY theatre do this!!  Also, Book of Mormon was hilarious and awesome, see it.

Pretty darn good. Tiny little place.  Really tiny.  The party of 14 waiting in front of me was surprised by the length of their wait time and left, but I mean what did they expect? In order to accommodate a party of 14 the place would have to pretty much clear out entirely. During dinner rush on a Saturday that might take a second. So, walking in and seeing they size, I imagined I too would have a bit of a wait. I put my name down but the hostess had no idea how long the wait would be, she simply told me there were "a lot of parties ahead of you". So, that was helpful. In any case we were there and wanted sushi, so we were in.  It gave the fellas of my party time to run to the store to buy some wine as the joint is BYOB.  I actually thought that was pretty cool, I like it.   We ended up waiting about an hour.  When we were seated our server was a little short with us.  She was busy.  So far this sounds like a 2 star review, amirite? But then we ordered.  First off, I really like that they offer so many non-sushi dishes.  My husband ALWAYS wants sushi, and sometimes I'm just not diggin' it, Hana's got me covered.  The Yasai Yakisoba was really good, the noodles had a nice gingery bite, the whole table enjoyed bites.  I've got my eye on the ramen for next time. We ordered a variety of sushi.  It all came in a wooden boat, a member of our party sang a bit of Andy Samberg's 'on a boat'' there were laughs, thanks wine.  There was a sugar cube on fire too, boy's love stuff on fire so half the table was really impressed. Every thing tasted fresh, and these are not the dime sized rolls that places like Sushi Brokers tries to pass off as sushi.  The only thing we weren't super impressed with was the baked scallop special, it tasted like sweet baby ray's bar-b-q sauce... not great.    So basically service needs work, sushi is good, fresh, and a fair size, and the noodles are bomb.

Our first Switch experience was watching the election results come in with some friends.  Small bar, itty bitty really, but we had a great time. Their specials are always really great, drinks and food.  You really can't beat their prices and I've yet to have anything I didn't like. Our service has always been top notch.  The bartenders have been friendly and knowledgeable.  They have always added to our experience and made our time there that much better.  I've made the mistake of liking Switch's Facebook page.  Good thing their prices are so great, otherwise I'd end up in the poor house because every time they post the nights specials with a picture of whichever Delicious dish they are featuring I am sold.

My husband has been talking about this place since he saw the episode of Man Vs Food that highlighted it. It didn't seem appealing to me, so I have been putting him off.  Next time dear.  Well, relationships are about compromise my friends, so eventually I had to give in and take the boy to Los Reyes. My expectations were not high.  I mean, tortas are sandwiches right?  Why get so excited.  And so what if Adam Richman attempted to give himself a heart attach here, I'm not big on the competetive eating circiut so a sandwich the size of my head is not my cup of tea. The store front is in a run down stip mall.  It proudly dispalys a picture of Mr.Richman.  It's a little skeezy.  I prepare myself for the worst. I have an issue with calling something with no tequila a margarita, or no rum a pina coloda.  So, maybe call 'em smoothies.  I am not impressed by the menu. My husband got the La Reyna.  Now, a little background, one of our most explosive fights to date involved what he calls 'sandwich sience'.  I was packing his lunch, 'cause I'm nice like that, and he instructed me that the way I make a turkey sandwich is completely wrong.  He tried to school me in the ways of 'sandwich science' I gave him the butter knife and told him to pack his own lunch.  When my husband recieved his torta I swear to God a single tear fell down his cheek.  The cooks at Los Reyes de la Torta are certified sandwich scientists.  The way they wrapped the chorizo in the egg was probably the most beautiful sight my husband had ever seen.  His expression trumped the one he had on our wedding day as I walked down the aisle.   His silence through out the entire meal, and the fact that I never got a bite, leads me to believe that the sandwhich was not only well constructed, but very tasty.  I had the alambre de camaron.  It was shredded shrimp, onions, cheese, jalepenos, rice, beans, and tortillas.  And you know what?  I was totally wrong about this place.  Seriously.  This was so good!  Adam Richman, you did me right. Los Reyes de la Torta, thank you for a great meal!

Veggie Korma.  The best veggie korma ever.   I have dreams about thier veggie korma.  Beautiful dreams.  And naan, I'm always a big fan of naan, they do not disappoint.  The fiancé and I have tried a variety of their meat dishes during our visits; have yet to find anything we weren't a fan of.    We have since switched to only enjoying this fine establishment during their buffet lunch, because hey we are in a recession in case you haven't heard, and even thought their prices aren't bad my Indian food habit was getting a little pricey.  The lunch buffet is very inexpensive, and you have enjoy all the delicious fluffy naan you can handle.  It's a great way to try out different dishes, especially since the hubby claims that he "doesn't like lamb" this makes it possible for me to indulge in Marys little friend without battling it out with him.  I do however wish they would serve veggie korma during their lunch buffet more often, because once again, delicious.  Though when I've called to ask if they had it in the past they did put some out, so I think they are pretty much the nicest people ever.

A friend and I went for after work drinks about 6PM on a Friday.  Not a whole lot of parking and there was about a 30 minute wait, but it was peak time on a Friday night so that is to be expected.   Our server was great, there was never a dirty glass on our table ( how many bus boys do the have!) and we enjoyed our brews.   I've been a fan of Four Peaks Hop Knot for awhile, and found San tan's Hop Shock a great competitor, I really don't know which is more delicious. We shared the Santan Slingers, which were awesome.  They arrived quickly and nice and hot.   I enjoyed this trip, Will be back.

I don't know why people keep insisting on coming here, but rest assured if there is a birthday, anniversary, or promotion someone will enthusiastically suggest Saddle Ranch as the venue to celebrate. Maybe it's the mechanical bull... but for me watching some 19 year old ride the bull while some 40 year old dude wearing an affliction shirt and years of regret shouts inappropriate things at a girl young enough to be is daughter is more the makings of a To Catch a Predator episode rather than a good time. I know it's not the service... I've been to multiple locations, and this one multiple times, and I can tell you it isn't the service.  Unless your favorite type of beer is an empty one, then this is your joint.  Must be the cotton candy.  Yes, that's it.  If you really need some cotton candy and the Arizona State Fair isn't in town then I suggest Saddle Ranch.

During my future sister-in-laws 21st birthday the bartender over at Blue Moose told us Patties should be out next stop.  I'm glad we listened. Drinks were cheap. Lots to do, ping pong pool and the like. But most importantly AMAZING service.  The bartenders here made her feel like a million bucks on a birthday with a less then stellar start. Especially Jason.  Jason, you sir, are a true bartender.  You realize that tending bar is not just pouring drinks.  A great bartender can make our break an experience, and he made ours.

Water spots on the body, I don't think they even bothered with the windows, and the steaks of armor all on the dash were not very appealing.  So the wash sucked.  But what sucked more is that someone stole my husband credit card from in between the seats. We went for lunch while they "washed" my car and I remembered that I had dropped his card before we had gotten out. My fault for leaving it in there, but you'd think the manager would have cared just a little that someone on his staff stole. Nope. He shrugged it off, "its not like I can look through their pockets". I'm not expecting miracles here, but he came off as though this happens all the time and he could not have cared less. While he was looking for the card in the car he didn't even notice the crap job they did. I guess that's just the normal caliber of work they do there.  I called and canceled the card right away, spoke with the fraud dept. at the bank today, someone tried to use it at a Blockbuster express, apparently that's what credit card thief's do to see it the card is working.  So basically, I would recommend that you avoid them all together. Unless you thoroughly enjoy being ripped off because even if you removed everything that isn't bolted down you still wont get what you paid for.

We've been twice for their summer deal, which was a great deal. The first time we had the caprese salad, which I loved, and the prosciutto and melon pizza, which was.... ok. Nothing too exciting there, I wont get it again. The second time was the chicken and pine nut salad, this is salad was really good as well. We also had the sausage and caramelized onion pizza which was much better than the prosciutto one.  Its a great place for a cheap meal before a movie. We will be going back.

We were looking for a place for a quick lunch where our pup could join us.  We gave Maizie's a call, they said dogs are welcome on the patio, if they are nice. So, we took our dog home, because she is a terror.  Just kidding, She's nice, she meets the requirements... unless you're a bicycle, then she will try to rip your tires off... not sure why. Anyway, it was a lovely day on their patio.  It's a very nice patio, and they even bring your pup its own bowl of water. Classy touch. I had the Cenpho press with a Caesar salad.  Very good, but ooey gooey cheese is rarely a disappointment. The husband had the Blue burger, he ordered regular fries, they brought sweet potato.  Our fabulous waitress brought out the correct fires immediately, and I see why they mistake was made, who would get regular old potato fries when the sweet potato ones are so good?  They pup and I shared some of those, while my husband enjoyed his regular fries and burger. Services was friendly, it's a nice place, and the food was good.  We will be back.

This place is walking distance from my house, which is the greatest thing on earth.  Its clean, the staff is friendly, and I can get cheap and easy dinners for two that arent at all bad in a pinch.  And their produce doesn't suck, which I like.

I have been really wanting to go to Christopher's for awhile now, so when some fabulous fellow yelpers invited me to join them after the elite event at Capital Grille I was very excited.   We went for happy hour, which is a great deal.  The wine list is a novel, you may want to bring a book mark or some sticky tabs, because at 1/2 off you'll be wanting to try a few.   Our server had his hands full with so many yelpers, but did a great job and was very flexible with our separate checks.  Golden. It's hard to choose what to get, everything looks amazing, but the hubby and I settled on the sopressata and ricotta pizza.  The crust was divine, really really good, the toppings didn't hit the spot for us, I'll be trying another one next time.  The mac-n-cheese that was passed around our table was amazing.  Order. It.  Really. The place is nice.  Very nice.  However the sink freaks me out, makes me feel like someone is going to grab my hands and pull me in, but Christopher's is in no way responsible for my neurotic tendencies. Anyway, I'll be back, for more wine, lots of mac-n-cheese, and probably one of the happy hour burgers I've heard so much about.

I must confess, this review is way way over due. And there is not excuse, though if you would accept that the dog ate my review I might try and tell you that is exactly what happened. In actuality I was looking through my reviews today and noticed this one was never written.  The hubby and I went to tuck shop in November. Yup, that long ago. We stopped in before enjoying the art walk. I'm a really big fan of the location, I love all the historic homes, any excuse to drive through these lovely neighborhoods works for me. And the building they are housed in, beautiful. I really love how they set this up. The dining room is lovely and I look forward to taking advantage of using the huge table in the middle of the dining room for a birthday or other celebration in the future.  Service was good, our waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable of the menu. I really love the bottled tea they served.  Now for the important part, the reason I am writing this review so long after the fact: the chorizo stuffed dates, covered in gouda. OMG. I mean really. OMG. These suckers are like little pieces of heaven. My husband and I could not get enough. Sweet and spicy and smoky. I now serve my attempt at them at every family gathering, I think they are making my mother-in-law start to hate me a little less, so special thanks for that Tuck.  We also had the cheese curds, another first, and they were good. And we split the rib dinner. Those ribs, oh boy, the meat just melted off of the bone in the absolute best way possible. My husband was none too impressed by the cole slaw, but its hard for any cole slaw to stand out in a meal like that.  My only gripe, like some of the other reviewers, is the price to portion ratio. We only had four of those mind blowing dates, which would be fine, if the price was better proportioned to the size. I felt a tad bit taken on the ribs also, again small portion for the price. This is the only reason I haven't been able to talk the hubby into another visit as of yet.

Ok, so I'm no expert on cajun food, at all.  To be completely honest the only experience I've had are through Anthony bourdain on the travel channel and a botched birthday meal at papa deaux.  After stumbling upon this place on yelp while at work, it was all I could do to not call out for the rest of the day and satisfy my craving for dirty rice right then.  When I did get off I grabbed my hubby and drove all the way to Avondale.  He ordered the sausage po boy, with cajun chips and cole slaw, and I had the Friday special, it was shrimp in a gravy over rice, dirty for me, I have no idea what it was called.  The shrimp was amazing, the spicy smoky flavors over the dirty the dirty rice hit the spot.  ITs a good thing mine was so good or my fiancé would have had to fight me for his po boy, that sausage was to die for.  I love the cole slaw, but thought the chips were so so, He loved the chips and thought the cole slaw was so so.  The employees were friendly the prices were good.  The decor was... colorful...  Overall, big fan.  P.S. Beer would be nice.

A long long time ago I saw Chef Hebert featured on a local news show. His name caught my attention, as we (used to) share it, and the concept stuck with me. The thought of tiny pretty delicacies being presented to me by a pro without my input was very enticing. For at least a year I talked this place up to my then fiance. When we decided to post pone our honeymoon we decided that a no limits night at Posh would be a fun substitute. We were not wrong  Even before we entered the restaurant service was wonderful. We were both unfamiliar with tasting menus, so I called and asked question about what would be best. The gentleman on the phone was incredibly helpful. We opted for the full tasting with wine parings, the early seating on a Friday night.  We were the first ones in the place, which I loved. It was nice to see everyone setting up for the night, and watch as the tables filled. Our server was amazing. He took the time to explain every dish and every wine paring, as well as answer all of the questions we had. And his wine paring skills were definitely worth mentioning. My husband and I like wine, and we like food, and understand that the two can really compliment each other, but this guy showed us how intense their affect on one another can be. When he learned that we were newly weds he sent chef Hebert over, which was a nice treat. The chef was warm and friendly, and very talented.  Everything was amazing. I had my first taste of froie gras, which I was nervous about, but really enjoyed. The spun sugar on top was a great touch, the sweetness was surprising. The kangaroo also stood out. It was so tender, really really great. My husband, who generally dislikes fish (even though he loves sushi, weirdo) and likes all of his proteins to be cooked to a crisp came out of his box for this experience and did not regret it for one second. He ate his kangaroo just the way the chef recommended it and loved every bite. From start to finish every bite was thoroughly enjoyed. This was a fabulous replacement honeymoon. We will be back!

I have nothing but nice things to say about all of the upward project restaurants.  Great food, beautiful ambiance, there's nothing not to love.  The bruchetta at postinos is amazing, and can we just talk about the sierra nevada mustard on the pub board? Good god, so tasty!!! And the monday and tuesday night 8pm deal can not be beat.  $20 for a bottle of wine and board of bruchetta?  YES! I have loved Postinos for a long time now, and love taking friends there, but the PHENOMENAL service provided Adrienne this past Monday night prompted me to write this review.  Seriously, she was the best server I have ever had!  That place is no joke on a tuesday after 8, busy doesn't even begin to describe, but Adrienne is a pro and made us feel like the only table in the joint.

Amelia was out of town during my wedding, so she sent Krista to do my bridal hair and makeup.  Krista was on time and ready to go, she had everything she needed for the day, even some little straws so her brides can drink without messing up their lipstick.  She was sweet and funny and made me feel at ease.  Since I had very few ideas on what I wanted and had asked her for her input on everything I was truly in her hands and could not have been happier with the result.  I had so many compliments through out the night on my hair and makeup, thanks to her hard work. I recommend her to anyone looking to get hitched in Vegas!

I've been hearing about this place for awhile now and finally tried it out.  The boy and I put our name on the list for the restaurant and decided to venture to the roof top bar while we waited. The pool area is lovely, as is  the lobby.  Neat elevator. Gorgeous view from the roof.  Really nice outdoor bar.  Plus they have Hendricks, so I was set.  The bartenders were super friendly, we had a nice chat and headed back down stairs. We were seated outside and pursed the menus. We shared the chochinita and fish tacos, they were very good.  The boy got the Naco Torta, he enjoyed it.  I had the chilquiles verdes with a side of rice.  The flavors were really good, I just wish there had been more of them.  Easily rectified with a healthy dousing of the provided hot sauce, not love lost here.  Our server was efficient, he kept our waters full and the food came out correctly and on time.  Maybe a little over enthused about correct pronunciation of each dish, but I can handle it.

There are basically 3 bars near my house. Out of those 3, this one has the best selection of brews, they introduced me to Deschutes Red Chair, and for that I cannot thank them enough. Its fairly basic bar food, When I go my husband and I spit the cajun wings and I get a club.  I've never been dissapointed with this at Caps. The service is friendly, and I think everyone at the bar knows one another, very cheers-esque.

Lunch buffet is so good!  And the staff really couldn't be nicer. My husband and I have been twice, once for take-out and once for lunch.  The friendly man at the counter took the time to explain the difference between northern and southern indian cuisine to us, which was very helpful.  Everything we have had has tasted great, but I especially love their samosas, which are also included in the lunch buffet.  We are happy to make this our new indian food spot!

I looooooooove thier pho!!! this place is always swinging.  I don't think I have every stopped by without nearly every table being full.   And for good reason, that pho!  Everything looks great, and smells wonderful, but I tend to stick to this awesome soup and spring rolls or a banh mi!   The parking can be a bit of  a hassle, this could actually be the worst parking lot in Phoenix, but it is worth it. And you know what they always get my togo order right, which is a nice plus.

I am lucky enough to live very near by this thai place.  We have it almost weekly when I refuse to cook.  We have tried the yellow curry, pad thai, thai toast, and the Pa-Naeng Curry.  I have yet to be disappointed.  The prices are good, the portions are large (I Always share a meal with my husband and then have lunch the next day)  and the staff is very friendly.

I can not say enough about Murphy's Law.  I LOVE this place.  I stopped in last year when planning my Vegas wedding to see if it would be a good place to have my wedding reception.  I didn't even look anywhere else. There was no need; they had everything I was looking for.  The bar is beautiful; brick work every where, great patio, nice lounge area with plush couches.  And The Chef and owner we met with could not have been nicer.  They seemed excited to have a wedding reception there, something not everyone I had contacted in Vegas was supportive of, and assured me it would be wonderful.  Fast forward a year and they were right.   We had our wedding reception there on Friday March 11th, and things went of beautifully.  My guests, my husband, and I had an amazing time, the food was great, and the drinks were pouring, and beer pong was a blast.  Jeff was so accommodating through out the whole process.  When a too drunk friend was sent to set up and went MIA, Jeff put everything together for us before we even knew what had happened.  And Shelly, was great as well, the entire staff ensured we had an amazing evening.  Thank you all for making my wedding so great.

Oh Hula's The first time we came in a noticed the spicy shrimp caesar.  I thought mango in a caesar was a pretty odd choice.  I tried it thinking that the two really didn't go together but was pleasantly surprised!   The next trip I ordered the Jerk Pork.  Holy pig.  Seriously, this pork was melt in your mouth tender.  Chewing was hardly necessary.  The flavor was really really good.  All of the sides were delicious, the fried plantains were just right and the Jamaican johnny cakes were passed around our table for everyone to try. Out of all the guests we have taken with us no one has ever left disappointed.  We have yet to run into anything mediocre and always look forward to our next trip.

I really enjoy Blissful. The instructors are helpful, even for a newbie like me.  They are patient and take the time to make sure you are getting the benefit of the poses while making sure you don't hurt yourself. Their on line booking system is easy, and when I've dropped in I've never had a problem getting in. The classes are not over crowded.  The studio is clean and modern. The only downside is the price, its a bit steep, but you get what you pay for.

I've been to 5th and Wine twice now and have enjoyed both visits.   The most recent was a weekend lunch.   Their wine deals are great a $5 a glass, and their lunch menu was good.   I had the egg sandwich, which was great,  the husband had the elk burger. Can I just take a second here to talk about spicy raspberry jalapeno ketchup? This is a condiment people need to know about, and I feel it is my duty to get the word out there. It came on the elk burger, and we requested a side.  Sweet potato fries and spicy raspberry jalapeno ketchup were simply meant to be together.  They are culinary soul mates. Quick friendly service, good food and drinks, good prices.  Happy camper.

Yes yes, the pretzel fondue, of course.  But also, the salted caramel custard. This is something I would not normally order, but at lunch for a coworkers birthday this was brought out and I'm glad it was. So good. I had the shrimp Cesar too, and was impressed. The ice tea was also tasty. Looking through the drink menu I will be back, after work instead of during, so I can give them a shot!

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place.  Shocking.  I LOVE this place. Their quesadillas are doughy cheesy heaven.  HEAVEN. Their tacos are the stuff dreams are made of. Their salsa bar proof that there is a god. Well, that may be much, but still, awesome place. And guess what kiddies? They finally have beer! Decor is nice, room is a bit small to contain all this awesomeness though.  Its cozy. let me recommend  the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco.  That pork, tender, so very very tender.  Amazing in the quesa as well. The dogfish shark and shrimp are great too.  I haven't been disappointed yet actually. Order one of everything! (maybe two of the pork)

If I were reviewing food alone this would be an easy 4 star, maybe even 5, it's the only reason we went twice.  That sage fried chicken will forever be in my dreams; unfortunately the service will always haunt my nightmares.  Two days in a row you guys failed.  Hard.  Telling us to come check on our table in 20-30 minutes because the buzzers don't work in the casino (why even give them out? If we aren't in the casino we are sitting right in front of your face, just call our name), then when we come back in exactly 19 minutes you have given away our table and proceed to sit three more parties in front of us.  Don't tell us we can go downstairs if you are going to give away our table.  Our waiter on this day was a little flighty; service was al little slow, but nothing too bad, 20% was earned. But day two taught us how bad it could be.  Our server started off with a little banter, a little personality is always nice, and was lacking the day before.  Then she was gone.  I had ordered a BLT Mary (which was delicious), and delivered to my table after about 10-15 minutes by someone else,  our server did appear when I had finished it to see if id like another.  I said no thank you, but some more water would be nice, and a dining companion asked for a re-fill on her diet coke.  The diet coke made it back, but no water.  Then another server brought out one of our four food orders.  A bit later two more orders, then the final.  Still no server and no water.  None of us got water until we were finished eating and finally flagged down a server from another table, and you can imagine how long that was with the size of their portions.  We waited about 10 more minutes, still thirsty, and finally asked a bus boy for water and a box.  He brought the water, thank god.  After another 10 minutes out server came back, we asked for her to get the box, she did.  We also asked for out check.  She gave us some flack about coupons, but finally got it done.  WORST SERVICE EVER Moral of the story, sage chicken delish, but have lots of time and low expectations for everything else.

Why on earth would I review a Starbucks, right? I mean, lets face it, Starbucks experiences are fairly run of the mill.  Anyone who hasn't had a beverage from Starbucks has probably just crawled out of their bomb shelter because their 30 year supply of freeze dried astronaut food has run out.  Once they get over the shock that the 'big one' never hit and there is no longer a USSR they will quickly have their first Starbucks experience.  But I digress.   I have one reason to leave this review:  the girl that ran drive thru that one time I went knocked my M F'ing socks off.   I don't often do Starbucks, however I am a sucker for one thing: you put the word salted in front of caramel and I am there. Starbucks did just that so there I was, looking for a salted caramel mocha fix before class.  No time, so I chose drive thru where I was greeted by the most chipper voice I have ever encountered.  Now one might think 'well yeah, if I was surrounded by untold amounts of caffeine I too would be perky at work.'  But no my friends, this was a whole new level of happy, whoville had nothing on her, the Grinch would have had no shot stealing cheer from this drive thru, his heart would have exploded.  Her sunny disposition would not have simply defeated the Grinch, it would have made him dead. She commended my salted caramel choice, I felt proud.  She suggested a venti, which is far too much caffeine for me but I could not resist.  She said I deserved it, and I believed her.  She was excited to swipe my credit card, complimented my hair, and handed me my beverage.   I didn't even need that coffee, her personality was infectious, I was ready to Carpe Diem!! or Yolo for the younger crowd.  Then someone stole my parking spot at school and that was over, but I still had the coffee and it was good.  Either way, that girl, whose name I don't know, that one time I went to this Starbucks knocked my socks off, and for that I thank her.

There's a lot to this.  The short? Crap customer service, can't remember to return calls and are very rude. Crap photographer. $500 CD of photos, maybe 50 photos on it (many of which are just the same photos in black and white and sepia) With probably 10 decent pics on it because the photog sat in the corner. TOOK ME ONE YEAR TO GET SAID PHOTOS! Great officiant.  There are too many quickie chapels in Vegas to go here.   So, we chose Chapel of the Bells because my parents were actually married here. Decor wise little has changed since their wedding in the 80's. That's fine, it was a kitschy Vegas wedding.   Unfortunately little has changed technology wise either.  For music I brought my ipod and speakers, that's fine too, I can roll with it, I'm getting married to my best friend of 10 years, the rest hardly matters. We booked a whole year in advance.  Since they do not allow outside photographers I  was very specific about asking if the incredibly expensive and limited number of pictures in the package we were buying were chosen by me and my future hubby, or some stranger just picking and choosing what he liked. Mary was very clear about our ability to pick them.  Good, if I'm only getting 3 shots of my wedding I need them to be good ones. I asked if the photog had a portfolio.  Mary scoffed.  "no, no portfolio, only like 20 year of experience"  red flag.  Oh well, just go with it. I call 6 months out.  Check to make sure our reservation is still on the books, and ask again about picking the pictures.  Mary tells me again that we choose them. Call two days before. Same convo with Mary.  The big day arrives.  The officiant who married us was an absolute doll.  He did a fabulous job and led a beautiful ceremony.  The Photographer stood in the corner. Red Flag.  The next day I call Mary, since my Mother in Law had paid for the package I had not gotten the specifics on ordering the pictures.  She told me they would email me a code in a few weeks and I could see the pics on line. OK. 4 weeks later I call Mary.  "oh you haven't gotten the code?  Let me see if I can find it, I'll call you Monday" This, 'I'll call you Monday' routine lasted 2 months.   Then one day, a large envelope arrives.  Guess whats in it.  Three crappy pictures from Chapel of The Bells. I call Mary again.  guess what, she will call me Monday. Again I don't receive a call back.  I call Mary and tell her I need to speak with someone else. I am transferred to a man who can't talk, He is driving you see, and he has the business line of Chapel of the Bells transferred to his cell phone which he doesn't not have a hands free set for. Here's and idea, buy a hands free set. When I do get to talk to him I explain what happened.  He gives me the website info and tells me to pick out the photos I want.  I do so, and call him back with the numbers.   He tells me it will take a couple of months to get them. I wait, and wait.  And I call back.  He has no recollection of this happening and transfers me to the "photo department" The woman a deal with from this point on is a gem.  She asks me why I waited so long, its been about 6 months at this point.  Really?  I tell her the whole story and to that she says 'We don't do that, you get images we choose, no one would have told you that'  Oh really?   Well, I'm not happy with these images, I paid money, I WAS told I would pick, so what now. She doesn't understand why I can't just be happy with what I got.  Because they are not good photos I tell her.  She tells me that she doesn't think she can even get the photos for me, since its been so long. This is exactly what you want to hear about your wedding photos. So, A year after my wedding, and I have to pay $300, on top of the $200 we already shelled out, for the whole CD of the pictures.  There are maybe 50 pictures on the CD, 1/3 of which are just the same pictures but they clicked the sepia button in photo shop and added some crap shadow effect around the edges. If this is 20 years of experience I am a freaking unicorn.  I am not happy.  Just don't.  Seriously.

The fiance and I came here for a very early dinner. We were greeted as soon as we walked in by very friendly staff and seated right away. There were only two other parties in the restaurant, but no surprise since it was so early. We both had pad thai with beef instead of shrimp and shared the golden bananas. I'm new to thai cuisine, but really enjoyed my noodles. The meat was cooked and seasoned very well, the veggies were delicious, the noodles were not too soggy and a great thickness, and the sauce was delightfully spicy with just a tiny bit of sweetness to it. All of the staff was super friendly, and the manager made sure to stop by and speak to us about our meal as well as their promotions and lunch buffet.  My fiance said his pad thai was not the best he has had, but that he did enjoy it very much.  And my left over noodles made for a great lunch the next day.

We've been twice now, and left happy and full both times.  The first visit was a Sunday around noon. The ambiance is nice, especially the "outdoor" area. My husband and I are in a constant battle on where to sit in a restaurant. I love love love sitting outdoors, even in the summer, he hates it, no matter how nice the weather is. Its as if the Vig knew this, and found a compromise. It feels like outdoors, complete with an Astra turf bocce ball course, but its enclosed and air conditioned, perfect for Arizona and my marriage.  Our server was friendly, ready with suggestions, timely. We shared a bottle of wine, I think bottles were 1/2 off or something like that, great deal. I had the flat bread pizza with tandoori chicken, it was great, and the boy had vigazz burger, which he was impressed with, so much so that we returned a week later for $5 burgers.  This time we each had a beer, they have a great selection, and a vigazz burger and arcadia burger, which we split. Both were delicious. So were the sweet potato fries and curry ketchup. Loved it.  We will be back.

I really enjoyed my experience here. Right when we walked in they guy at the counter was super helpful. He explained the menu to us, gave us his suggestions, and gave very detailed descriptions of everything they have. I had the tonkotsu ramen, spicy, and my dining companion had the republic ramen, spicy as well, both with pork. We grabbed our drinks (best iced tea ever!) and found a table. The place was modern, and most importantly very clean. Our orders arrived quickly in gigantic steaming bowls. While my fiances noodles were delicious, I defiantly out ordered him, my tonkotsu broth was heavenly. I loved all the veggies and the noodles were just right. And we both had enough for lunch the next day!    By the way, Ive been twice now and Ty has been working the counter both times. I hope the rest of the employees are even half as friendly and knowledgeable as he is! Every time I have a question he gives a very informative answer and always seems to be pretty passionate about it too.

I went here with a groupon.  I've been trying out different salons down town to see what I like, and Shampoo Ink has been on my list, so when I saw the deal, maybe it was actually living social?, I jumped on it.   I'm happy I did. Sally was kind, funny, and professional.  She answered all my questions, gave me advice, and told me exactly what she was doing while she was cutting and styling my hair.  I am very happy with the finished product, and really enjoyed my time in the salon.  The eyebrow waxing is a really nice additional service. The salon is clean, and the art and set up makes for a very cool atmosphere. Everyone who worked there was nice, and seemed generally happy to be working there. Sally gushed about her brother, the owner of the salon, which was endearing.  He even made an appearance and we talked about one of his past jobs in banking.   The whole experience was laid back and comfortable, made even more relaxing by the feeling that you are in the hands of a professional. I will be back.

This review is about taste only, as I can not speak for service or ambiance as the donuts were brought to me during a meeting at work this morning. When our Supervisor announced that she brought Bosa Donuts the room pretty much erupted in cheers of joy. I had never heard of Bosa, but the donuts looked good. I grabbed a jelly filled, and it was divine. The glaze was sweet and wonderful, the jelly was superb, and I loved loved loved the dough. I am now a Bosa convert, and will join in the cheering next time they are presented.

The Duce is a pretty cool spot. Taking on this huge warehouse is quite a challenge, but I think they did it nicely.   The airstream they serve the food from is a cool touch, marking your order with a nickname (they have a list of some if you can't think of one) is kinda neat too. The old timey bar, soda jerk fountain, and boxing ring are cool touches. The drinks, while pricey, are pretty darn good.  My husband loves a good old fashioned, and its a pain to find one, the Duce didn't really deliver there, but their Tom Collins made up for it! Everyone was friendly and fun. The food was good.  The sliders were amazing and I will be coming back for those corn coins, so so good. I also hear they have swing dancing on Tuesdays, can't wait to check that out.  Down sides:  the old fashioned needs some work, its was unbearably hot when the gigantic fan turned off for no apparent reason, its was just bearable when it was on, but that to be expected in an old ware house during and Arizona summer. Also, the corrugated steel bathroom stalls make me feel like I am hunkering down for the zombie apocalypse when all I need to do is tinkle.

I fill in at an office near by here from time to time, and every night when I go home delicious aromas waft from their building to my nose, making me instantly hungry and causing me to break every speed limit to get home and have some dinner. Today was finally my day to try them out for lunch. I only ordered the veggie korma and a garlic naan to go, and the gentleman working there threw in some of those soggy dough nut dessert thingies, which was very sweet. Everyone was nice, my order was done on time, and the food was exactly what I had hoped for. My spice level for today was medium, which was good, but I think I'll go all the way next time. The buffet also looked great, maybe I'll go that route next week.

Whats that?  A creme brule food truck?!  ReallY!  Once I spotted this truck at the phoenix market I grabbed my already over stuffed fiance by the arm and dragged him to the window.  The list of flavors was entising, but sadly we arrived late and the jolly proprieter was already out of a few flavors (salted carmel (!) oh, I will be back).  The two of us ordered a bannana creme brule to split and joked with the chef about his idustrial blow trouch as he prepared our treat.  It was amaizing, and I am generally not a huge bannana fan, but this was really great.  And whats this I read about a lavender creme brule?  I can't wait to see the flavors this man comes up with in the future, so I can try them all!

Great late night snack, nothing like a runny egg on a burger to put the alcohol raging through your system in check. And the crack sauce on the fries.  Yes.  Yes please.

I finally caught up with these guys at the phoenix market. I really love the soft flat bread they use as buns, its wonderful. And the owner, couldn't be nicer. My experience was really a positive one. The dog I had with the mango chutney on it was great, the one with blue cheese, cole slaw, and barbecue sauce was surprisingly good as well. I hope to catch them at shadys in the future!

so, my husband has hobbies.  Lots of them.  And when he starts a hobby he becomes mildly obsessed. Saltwater tanks are a hobby of his. Therefore,  I have been to MANY a tropical fish store, and let me tell you, Reef Culture is THE BEST. These guys know their stuff.  Anytime I have a question about some odd growth or surprise invertebrate, they have answers. The store is clean, squeaky clean, modern, very appealing. The stock is great, they always have some cool pally or fish I've never seen before. And they have Guinness.  Guinness the dog, not the tasty adult beverage.  Guinness the dog is awesome.  He may be the sweetest dog ever.  In short, I highly recommend them.

The boy and I must have driven past this place 15 times before they opened, just waiting for the day that the open sign was lit.  We hadn't been on this side of town for awhile, so when we realized we would be nearby tonight we were both very excited.  We arrived right as they opened for dinner, the owner could not have been nicer, he explained all of our options and tha let us look over the menue.  The girl working the counter was also super nice, she answered all of my fiances questions about the big kahuna challenge, which I think he is gonna try to complete on a future trip. He had an island dog and a sunset dog, they were both delish, and are you kidding me with that mango topping? Heaven.  He also got some tots which I'm told were crispy and delicious.  I had the tiki dog, I will dream about that dog tonight. Its toppings consisted of everything that is right in this world, we could negociate peace treaties with these dogs. it was a tasty turkey dog with chipotle garlic mayo, maui mustard, the most amaizing creamy delicious cocunut topping, avacodo, and bacon.  If you don't already have your keys in hand to run down there and get one immediatly I just don't know what's wrong with you.  I will say, the fries I had were just a little soggy for my liking, but that will not stop me from returning soon and often!

They have some new wings. I couldn't decide at first how much I liked them. I was in between alright and really good. The next day when I pulled the leftover out of my fridge and had them cold I was at really good.  Maybe I just like em cold, or maybe my focus was elsewhere as my hubby was attempting the Big Kahuna Challenge, which he failed miserably. I figured after the ridiculous amount of food he tried to scarf down we would be on a Maui dog break, I was wrong. In 24 hours he was already suggesting we go back for the sliders he had gotten with the challenge, he was a big fan of them.

Just as lovely as their 59th and union location.  My month membership allows me to use both studios, which gives me a greater variety of classes and times to select from, which is nice.   Clean fresh space, helpful knowledgeable instructors, lots and lots of different classes.

Atmosphere is fun.  I guess.  And my chips and wings were good.  My comrades tell me the honey jalapeño wings were too hot,  there was sweating, runny noses, and tears, but I dug them.  I like it hot! But service was slow all night and not very attentive.  Not a fan.

Yum. You should try this. I split the steak Jamburitto with my husband ( and still had leftovers for lunch)  and the very friendly man taking our order urged us to get the hush puppies.  Glad we listened 'cause Yum.  Really liked the hush puppies.

The thought of ever sitting in a sticky, stinky, over filled Harkins again makes me want to cry.  iPic has ruined all other theaters for me.  First off, these seats are huge.  Sorry fly boys, that yawn move isn't going to work here. Copping a feel would be serious work.  And to the 10 year old in every R rated movie I go to way past their bed times, your parent's poor decisions wont effect me tonight.  Unless your wearing stilts no way are you kicking the back of my seat. Over priced soda.  No thanks, I'll take a glass of wine, or the complimentary sodas they offer.  Stale popcorn, uh none for me thanks, fresh popped and free!  But save room for the extensive menu they offer.   Was it pricey? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely.  Oh, and there's a soft fluffly blanket sitting on the seat for each guest.  Nice touch, ipic, very nice touch.

This ones tuff because I really had a great time at v-spot.  But as the days go by I'm begging to have second thoughts.   I took 3 other ladies in for some pre-wedding pampering.  We got many different services. We all had a great time while there, the champagne was flowing, and our spirits were high.  The staff was all very friendly, though the gentleman that did our pedicures did make some minor grumbles and complaints.  I had a Brazilian bikini wax, my first one, and it's possible it was my technician's first one too... she was really sweet and I think she will be great because she really has a great attitude, just seems to need a little more time.  My wax job came out very patchy.  I also got the v-jazzaling.  I thought it would be a fun wedding night surprise.  She told me that they have crystals or glitter and we decided on the glitter.  I checked and double checked that it would stay on until Friday night (we were in on Wednesday) and she said it absolutely would, that it generally lasts weeks before it starts to fade.  Well, for me it started to fade and flake the next night.  My lady bits looked like a shattered disco ball by my wedding night, which was a surprise to both me and my husband.  I also had the Shellac mani and lacer pedi.  My pedi is still going strong 6 days later, but the mani, which I was really really concerened about since it was for my wedding, got three chips by the day and now, 6 days later, half of the polish on my pointer finger is missing as well.  Sorta bummed about having chipped polish in the close up shot of mine and my husbands rings in wedding pictures.  I was assured this would last for two to three weeks, it didn't make it one. The salon has a really good start; almost all of the staff was so friendly and wonderful, and fun to be around.  If it's a good feeling and fun memories you're looking to leave with you won't be disappointed.  However, if it's a long lasting mani and smooth bikini line you might not be so lucky.

My husband and I came in early on a week day, after lunch not quite dinner. We were one of I think 3 table in the joint.  Fine by me, again, weird time of day,  but I needed a drink. It was happy hour, sweet.  Drink wise their happy hour is OK, but when you look at their specialty cocktails you will have a hard time sticking to the happy hour menu.  The Shrinking Violet was awesome!  Pricey, but oh so yum. We split a couple of appetizers.  We were not at all disappointed by any of them. I could have stuck a straw in the broth of the Shrimp and Smoked Jalapeno Rioja Butter and just sucked it all up, really.  That good. The hype on here about the Market Street Short Rib Tacos, not a lie.  So good.   And finally the Brown Sugar Jerk Pork Sliders.  Tasty.  Really really really tasty. With how much we enjoyed the starters I look forward to going back more the main event.  Oh, and the service was great too, very friendly.

So My husband and I wanted to take my Mom out to celebrate her promotion and she chose Blue Agave. She and my father and been once before with friends, and my Mom had been going on about their Bulldog Margaritas for weeks.  We made the trip out there and when we arrived went straight to the bar. We walked right past the man who would be out server and took a seat. The restaurant was slow, only and handful of people at the bar and it didn't look like there was anyone in the dining room at all. It remained this way through out the night. So I am confused on why our service was so slow. While we waited for our server, my father noticed that another server had to make the gentlemen we almost walked right into aware of our presence. I guess we were hard to see, being at a bar table right near the kitchen and all. Through out the night service continued this way. A little tip, apparently you have to order a beer twice for it to arrive at your table, or at least that was the case for dear old Dad.  The food was better then the service, but just barely. Charging 50cents a tortilla seems odd, but we went for it because we really wanted to try the agave butter. The butter was good, not mind blowing, but good, the tortillas were small. They can't even shell out the chips and salsa, so I'm not surprised that the portions were a tad on the small side, you get that feeling that they are just fighting to keep their doors open by charging you for every thing they can. I had the sante fe shrimp appetizer as an entree, along with a side salad. I enjoyed the shrimp, as well as the rice they were served over. My salad was nice, the cilantro dressing was boring, but I liked that they used Jimica in the salad. Dad ordered the Green Chili Cheese Burger, meh. My Mom and husband both had the enchilada style lasagna. After they each poured about half a bottle of the house made tapitillo on top it was pretty good. The server admitted that he too uses the hot sauce when he orders it, so they know its bland. Maybe they are trying to cater to the older crowd that seems to frequent the place? Spice is your friend people!  We had tried to order another round of those bulldog margaritas before happy hour was over, cause they were most definitely the highlight of our meal. Our drinks were empty, our food was nearly gone, and our server had been MIA for awhile, so when we noticed it was 8 minutes until happy hour was over we flagged down another server and asked him to tell ours to order another round on happy hour prices. Well, the drinks came, but when we got our bill we noticed they were not on happy hour. We had meant to ask our server about this before he ran the bill, he should have mentioned that they were full price, but didn't. Well wouldn't you know, the only quick service he provided all night was swooping in snagging that bill of the table. He had ran the card before we even noticed he had picked up the check. Very stealthy.  So basically I will be making my own bulldog margaritas at home.

I think fizz rocket is the bees knees. I'm keen on the the variety, nifty retro candies, and knee slapping gag gifts. The shop is tidy, and owner is swell. From my very brief encounter with him I got the feeling that this neato pop shop is his dream, and I support dreamers.  I don't know why bottled soda pop makes me feel like I'm in a leave it to beaver episode, the candy sticks near the register further support this feeling.    And I had my first butterscotch beer.  Woozer.  That sure will wet your whistle.  I'm almost down to my last bottle, which will bring about another trip to this fizzy candyland, and another day where I drive my husband crazy with 'gee-whiz's', but even he will put up with my bad 50's sitcom talk for some good sarsaparilla.

The husband took me out for a night on the town, and I chose Citizen for dinner.   I have been wanting to try citizen for some time now, thanks to my yelp buddies, and was very excited that the time had come!  We made reservations for an early dinner before our show.  We arrived earlier than expected, no problem, they got us in right away.  Our server was quick, friendly, and knowledgeable.  He guided up through their specialty drinks and gave great menu suggestions.  We sampled a few of their specialty cocktails on happy hour, great drinks at a good price, and had the 'tender belly' bacon fat heirloom popcorn. I like that they list bar snacks and starters separately because this certainly isn't an appetizer, but its is a great bar snack.    I'd love to tell you what my husband had for dinner, whatever it was he liked it, but  you see my memory of the night is clouded by the memory of the decadent dream that is the Pan Seared Scallops.  Wouldn't you know, I had never had scallops before, well I have, but they have been raw, or just an ingredient in a pasta, I had been meaning to try them as the main course for awhile and boy am I glad I did. Scallops my friend, have been an underrated chorus girl in my life, but this dish gave them the chance to shine, and shine they did.  When given full billing they make you ashamed you had ever shoved them in the background in the first place. I will never again take scallops for granted.  I am actually in quite a pickle, because all of citizen's menu looks amazing, but I don't know that I can ever enter this establishment and order anything but those wonderful scallops again.

After getting a taste of Hey Joe!  at the first food truck event I was planning when I could check out the full menu. I was able to catch up with the truck during first Friday and boy am I glad I did.  Being new to Filipino food the menu was intriguing and maybe a little intimidating.   The menu item which listed pork belly fat under the name was a clear winner for me.    The guys at the truck were incredibly helpful, letting me know which of their delicious sauces would go best with me meal.  They were great.  The food.  Yum.  I mean, can pork ever be bad?  That pork fat coated the inside of my mouth, and thankfully I could taste it long after the plastic fork was  tossed in the trash can.  Not something I can indulge in often, but the lasting memory will keep me going for awhile.    And I will definitely be back to try some of their more artery friendly options!

I really dig film bar.  It's all arty and quirky, and I can have a glass of wine while enjoying a film.  Oh, and the staff is KILLING IT with thier staff picks this summer.   Good prices, nice atmosphere, great films.  Love it.

Not horrible, just incredibly unremarkable. The iced tea was good.  And though I didn't indulge in a cocktail their drink menu did look enticing. But then so did their dinner menu... I split the corn cake appetizer and fig and goat cheese pizza with the husband. Normally you'd get the appetizer first, but everything came out at once.  No big deal, I mean the server didn't ask and we didn't specify, so really no love lost there, just an observation.  The descriptions of both made them exciting choices. Then they arrived to our table. Really quickly at least.  The pizza looked good, the appetizer did not.  But whatevs, all looks the same in the end right? The barbecue sauce used on the pork for the appetizer was too vinegary.  The pork was fine, the corn cakes were ok.  Like the presentation the dish was lackluster. Same with the pizza.  We have had goat cheese and fig pizzas elsewhere and this one failed to compete.  The blobs of goat cheese were a little gamey for my liking, and rather than use actual figs they chose an overly tart spread, again in globs.  The crust was fine.  boring.  May be back for a cocktail on the patio,  but dinner will be elsewhere.

I love Postinos, and I love Churn, so naturally Windsor has been on my list for awhile.  Finally got to check it out and I must say, can the savvy folks that own these establishments do anything wrong?  Windsor was a win.  When we arrived there was a wait, but  the cocktail servers quickly had drinks in our hands ( a 17 and a 63) and we wondered around  the patio area.   The wait flew by as we took a walk down their musical memory lane in the form of the hall covered in cassette  tapes and were told by the friendly hostess that our table was ready. We sat down in the dim dining room, the atmosphere was fun and light hearted, and our server was there with some water.  She was kind and attentive, and brought us more drinks ( a 22 and sean minor pinot noir) and took our orders. We opted for appetizers that night, The charcuterie (loved the assortment of picked vegetables), the Deviled Egg dip (this one caught our eye, and glad it did!), and the loaded chips ( good, not the best we had that night, but good).  Overall we had a great time at Windsor, there was a little mix up with my credit card and another tables tab, but the server caught it before she even set the card down and fixed the issue before it ever became a problem.    Great night, we will be back.

My expectation for a dive bar: 1) cheap drinks 2) those drinks staying full 3)people watching.  Tempe Tavern fits the bill.  I like the patio out front.  The bathroom is neato.  I never have trouble ordering another drink from the bar.  I have simple needs.  Tempe Tavern meets them.

"Oh.My.God" -says I "what?!" -replies friend "What in God's name is a Brulee burger!?!" I quickly grabbed a paper menu off of the clean counter near the cash register and flipped open to the burgers.  I know what brulee means, burnt sugar, but how could this relate to a burger.  In my wildest sugary dreams I could have never dreamt of this.  A burger, delicious and meaty, on a very nice toasty bun, with Havarti cheese, Havarti people(!), bacon, porky crispy salty bacon, a fried egg, runny and delicious, and yes, BURNT SUGAR! "Two please... wait, no no, one, two would be silly.....(but if my friend wasn't here to witness this I would probably get 7)  and sweet potato tots please" What saint, what angel, what GOD could create this masterpiece?  What twisted sugary mind could come up with this concoction?  If ever I meet the mad scientist who put together this beautiful monster I am liable to leave my husband and marry them.    And their shakes looked really good too, I'll get one next time.

We were lucky enough to stop by here on a week night after the rush.  After a day of home searching, with no results, a nice quiet dinner is exactly what we needed.  And that it what we got!  Our waitress quickly greeted us, brought us our sangria and wine, both were tasty and  the price wasn't bad. She was friendly, and did a great job.  The place was clean, with a warm glow from the pizza oven, it felt like a hug in there.  So nice.    We started with Bruschetta, it was good.Really the traditional tomato, mozzarella, basil, and balsamic shone, sometimes the original just cant be beat.  We then went on to the margherita pizza, something I had been craving for months since I had seen a picture of it in a Phoenix magazine.  Those beautiful dollops of mozzarella, rather than being drowned in rubber cheese, are the stuff dreams are made of. This pizza did not disappoint.  The other we tried was the Schreiners Sicilian Sausage, again, simple and delicious.    We really enjoyed our meal here, and will be back.

Ignore those stars right there.   I know no other way to do this, than to split Hash House A Go Go into two reviews.  Review 1: solid 4 stars... maybe even five for the food. Whenever we visit Vegas we eat at Hash House, usually multiple times.  Their fried chicken is the stuff of dreams, and their BLT Blood Mary holds a special place in my heart.  Seriously get that Bloody Mary.  It's a meal in itself.  And the chicken and waffles.... there's bacon in those waffles.  Inside of them.  It's a breakfast miracle!  Review 2: 1 star... service. Can I even give service a star when it doesn't even exists at this place?  I image their training manual reads something the the effect of "screw it, I'm drunk".  Now here's your block t-shit, get out there kid!  I honestly do not know how my order is ever taken, and how the heck my food ever makes it to the table,  I believe the kitchen staff must have excellent hearing and have devised a way to cut the floor staff out of the process all together because anything these guys touch goes to crap.  Did you want another beverage?  Well, assuming you ever get the first one, too bad!  You will never see that server again! Someone else will drop off your food and run away from the table.  What's that? only half of your table got their food? Here's the check! Seriously guys, I submit myself to this neglect every time, the food is worth it and I'm on vacation so waiting isn't an issue, but maybe you could try and get your crap together.

So, the husband and I got a little taste of epic at the first food truck event.  We didn't get to sample all of their items, but  the ones we did were great.  The ones we didn't get to try there made us vow to track them down and try them out. I am a short leash fan, after this my husband was an Epic fan.  We were a divided household.   Well, we found them at first Friday and I've got to say, not only do their hot dogs impress, but these guys are seriously friendly.  They chatted with us, answered any questions, talked about the food truck scene.  They were great, you can tell they enjoy what they do.  They really won me over.  Genuinely good guys! Then I took a bite of their dogs. Holy crap.  So good.   We had the  Good Morning Dawg, a true testament to the power of eggs ( is there anything you can't put an egg on?!) the Seattle dog, cream cheese is NEVER a bad idea, and the Frenchie, with brie dijon mustard and pears it is not your average dog.  All were impressive, and we will be back!  You won me over Epic!

Pretty good burger.  Service was friendly and attentive and I really love those brioche buns.   I will say, the whole food challenge thing, while not for me (the last thing I need is a bunch of people gathering around to watch me eat)  creates quite the hoopla.  The hungry bear of a man attempting it while I was there attracted quite the crowd.  Good times.

Wordsworth is a hack. Van Gogh, complete chump. Mozart should be ashamed.  Because in comparison to the genius, the beauty, the absolute dream that is the Ceviche de Atun created by the mastermind that is Chef Garces, in the gracefully elegant setting that is Distrito those old dead dudes failed to create anything of importance.  No but really, dat ceviche! The menu description of it will pique your interest.  Yellowfin tuna, Serrano-coconut sauce, lime sorbet, tomatillo, tostaditas.  Seriously, Wordsworth, get your crap together, man.   When it arrives to your table, it will look small.  Like many of dishes here.  Tiny even. Inside this small bowl you will find the tuna, lovely, with tiny little tortilla chips the size of nickels.  The sorbet is there too, a vibrant and pleasant green.  All luxuriously bathed in that serranno- coconut sauce.  Oh and whats this? This delicate little cloud resting in this beautiful landscape? Cilantro foam.  Suck it Van Gogh, 'cause those finger paintings of yours got nothin' on this.  From your first bite to your last you will experience the most fabulous symphony of texture, flavor, and temperature in your mouth.  Mozart could bang out a concert, sure, but the flavors in this dish meld together to surround your tongue in a true euphoric experience that hack could never quite deliver.  So, basically.  I really like this ceviche.

Little Woody's is super cool. Really, you feel like one of the cool kids here.  But not like football star lead cheerleader cool, no  no, little Woody's is too cool for that traditional type of cool. No, first you feel speak easy cool.  Old school gangster cool.  Because there is no sign announcing the name of the place you feel in the know when you spot the big eyed owl gazing over the street and realize this is the place.  It's too cool for a name.  You enter through the back, which is the front, because the front has no entrance.  Cool, right? Then its dark.  not seedy dark, but masculine and sultry dark.  Again, really cool. Once you get your drinks you head over to the game room and a new kind of cool hits: nerd cool, gamer cool, arcade kid cool. Shuffle board, skee ball (!), darts  and foosball are always exciting, and winning free beer with your insane skee ball skills is the coolest! Didn't eat this time, but the chalk boards advertised some tasty looking options.  And their cocktails, while maybe a bit pricey, were super intriguing.  I stuck with beer on this occasion and it was frosty and quick.  Good night.

When I saw the groupon for a glass blowing class I ordered two immediately.  What could be more fun than glass blowing!! The answer, not a whole lot, this was a blast.  The instructors were friendly, fun, and experienced.  They knew exactly how to let you experience glass blowing and take the reigns, without letting you melt your hand off in a vat of liquid glass.  These guys know their stuff, and know exactly how to make this class fun and safe.  The little glass flower I made in this class will forever hold a place of importance in my home, all who enter will gaze in awe at my masterpiece.  Until I accidentally break it while cleaning, I am kind of a klutz, but no worries because I plan to take many many more classes with circle 6 and fill my home with many priceless works of art.  I will say, booking the class would have been easier if they had them listed on line, and wouldn't you know they announced during my class that they now have an on line booking program.  Way to go guys!  Check it out people, its a good time!

I like Mad Hatter. It's close enough to campus for me to walk over for a pint in between classes.   The food is consistent.  Not earth shattering, but good. They have a good selection of beer.  And it seems as though they rotate them out from time to time. Which is nice, variety is the spice of life you know. The bartenders have always been friendly, as well as the other patrons.   Very laid back. Which I like.

My memories of pop up pizza are fond... and fuzzy. After a long night of gambling, cigars, drinks, and thankfully winning, my friends and I were famished.  Unwilling to leave the sweet embrace of the casino we stumbled to pop up pizza, conveniently located near the slots.   I remember fried pickles.... and there not being enough, but they were tasty. We shared the Fremont.  Lots of veggies, lots of meet.  Super good.  It really hit the spot. Took a minutes to make, because they actually made it, so that was OK by us. Perfect late night snack.

After a yelp event some fellow yelpers and myself landed at Fuego after receiving no service at all at two of its neighboring establishments.  I'm glad we did.  There was only one server working this particular night and she handled the sudden influx of hungry people with grace!   I really enjoyed the chicken Fuego tacos and cubano sliders.  My iced tea was good too!   I will be back.

When the weather is nice there is absolutely no better place for lunch!  The food trucks are one of the reasons my husband and I wanted to move downtown, and having them all in once place is nice! So many options, and everything is good, you really cant go wrong! I recommend a luncha-rita from luncha libre, really great iced tea flavors!

I love Angels Trumpet.   Really great space, cool vibe.   Awesome beer selection, and amazing food. The only complaint would be how loud it gets inside, sound just bounces around in that place, but what can you do?  Everything else is so great and I always have such a great time when I am here that after diving in to my beer flight I hardly even notice.

I love postinos.  I love Windsor.  I love Churn. I knew I would love Federal. What I did not expect was for it to introduce me to my absolute favorite pizza in the world.   The aptly named Casanova stole my heart. As I read through the list of pies all sounded good, but the Casanova was a notch above the rest.  Its description read like a really alluring internet dating profile.  Prosciutto, dates and ricotta might as well have read well educated, good family, great smile, arugula was just icing on the cake, like having the same favorite band.  I was sold.   We all know a well written e-harmony profile does not insure success.  What looks great on paper does not necessarily equate to that special spark.  I nervously waited for my pizza, hoping it would be everything I hoped for.  Meanwhile I enjoyed a wine cooler. Not the "hey look guys, I totally scored us some booze" Bartles & Jaymes wine coolers of my teenage years, no these were more sophisticated and much tastier. I went with the raspberry lavender and was very pleased.  17 year old me was soo jelly. Then he arrived.  On time, dressed neatly.  I coyly eyed him before grabbing a slice, then dove right in. People, the sparks were there.  Love exists, it's real.  The Casanova was everything I had dreamed of.   I don't want to get to ahead of myself, but I for-see a long and happy relationship.

I really just come here for the chocolate chile shake.  That will come as no surprise to my yelp friends, as my affinity for oddly flavored frozen dairy based treats is well documented in the talk threads.  This shake comes as any  well made shake should.  With a gigantic straw.  This is the fattest straw I've ever seen.  Even with this colossal drinking implement you will sooner pop a blood vessel than get any of the sweet elixir to travel though it.   Nope, you gotta pop that lid off and spoon it into your mouth until it melts a little. It's that thick.  Just the way god intended a milk shake to be.  Then theres the chewy chunks of chile that assault your taste buds with a little kick of spice that accompanies the sweet chocolate goodness so beautifully.  Seriously.  Why is any chocolate shake EVER served without chile.  They belong together, in my mouth.

words cannot describe.  Seriously, these other reviews, their suggestions, those aren't lies.    Go.  Go now. Go often.  Nothing I've had to date can compare, that boiled fish.... oh so good.  But everything here is, I have been twice, with large groups, ordering more food than we should, and you know what? Nothing was less than amazing.  It's not fancy.  There really is no ambiance at all.  But guess what, that doesn't matter at all when thier food is this good.

So... This is gonna be kinda a weird one, guys. Because I went to a sushi bar, and had zero sushi.  I hear it's good though. Instead, I had the best damned old fashioned I've had in a long time.  Gin is for the summer.  It's fresh and crisp, and should be enjoyed on a patio. Whiskey, on the other hand, is for the cold. It is in hand when you are wrapped up in scarves and coats, battling the cruel Arizona winter, just trying to survive.  I am careful about where I order an old fashioned.  They require more than throwing some maraschino cherry that is an unnatural hue of red in a glass with a slice of orange and some booze.  No no no.  They need a gentle touch.  For this reason I never would have ordered one at a sushi bar.  But the bartender insisted I would not be let down, and I wasn't  Oh the joy of an old fashioned done right.   The faint hint of orange peel, the slight sweet of a cherry, the bitters marrying with the whiskey in a blissful union.  Yes.  Yes the bartenders at Squid Ink can make one helluva Old Fashioned.  And you know what?  The curry shrimp dish isn't half bad either.  The ambiance was nice, and the staff was on point.

I LOVE this place. I love it for french press and beingets on the weekends.  I love it for lunch, the croque monsieur is to die for and the beinget club is the most ridiculously amazing thing I've ever had the pleasure of stuffing in my face. I love it for dinner, nice bottle of wine, shrimp etouffee and beef bourguignon. Just so freaking good. And EVERYTHING in that pastry display.  Everything. I really love it.

Anyone who knows me knows that I love me some food trucks. I frequent the down town food truck caravan, but since I've started working in Scottsdale on the weekends I have been driving past this set up just waiting to give it a shot. I was not let down. A good number of food trucks, some I have had and loved and some I had not yet tried. It was hard to make a choice.  I went with some bar-b-q and creme brulee.  So good. And this set up is nice. Parking is not impossible, and they really let you know your in scottsdale.  They set up an eating area with a Moroccan theme.  Tapestries hanging, pillows ont he floor, colored glass lanterns on every table.  They really pulled out all the stops.  Very well done!

I really like the Vig.  I do.  I just dig it.   I have yet to sit inside because thier patio is just such a relaxing space.  I love the way they have converted this old house, you feel like you are hanging out in some rich kids backyard. Plus, brunch on weekends is a real deal.  Their bloody mary bar can suffice as all the breakfast you need with all the bacon and pickled vegetables.  But then you wouldn't want to miss out on the menu items, would you?

My husband and I have been on a serious search for falafel since our New York trip 4 years ago.  No one has quite stacked up to those delicious little chickpea balls served from food carts.   New yorkers, the food you get just walking down the streets is a gift.   An absolute gift.  You be grateful. But I digress.  After many failed attempts we have finally found a that little piece of heaven and so much more. The falafel here is on point.  On. Point.  The shawarma is freaking awesome, too.  The place in clean, the service is friendly and quick, and the prices a fair.   All good. But that falafel is GREAT.  So glad to finally have a go to falafel joint!

I had a shrimp burrito.  You know what I liked about it? It was simple.   No special sauce.  No fancy take on a classic.  Just some good grilled shrimp with minimal seasoning, fresh lettuce, tomato, and avocado.  Good tortilla too! I dig the crazy concoctions and re-imaginings as much as the next gal, but when simple is done right you are reminded how good it is.

5 stars after one visit? You betchya! Lovely space.  Clean and open. The drink menu.  Oh that drink menu.  I made a dent but will continue to work my way down that list.  The saying "each one better than the last" is woefully inadequate.  Each one is AMAZING.  Really! These cocktails are creative and beautifully crafted. That should be the theme of this spot. Food and drinks alike. Creative and beautifully crafted. That says it all. The food was equally impressive, if not more so.  Tonight I had the roasted bone marrow starter.  Savory, gelatinous.  With a duck bacon than cave such a wonderful spice on some toasted bread.  And a lovely arugula salad that was tangy and provided a wonderful contrast to the fatty marrow. Also had the quail.  Really great.  Crispy but not over cooked or died out. Oh.  And it came with smoked whiskey butter. Yeah, read that again: Smoked. Whiskey. Butter. That, thanks to The Local, is now a thing that exists outside of your dreams.

I have been looking for a stylist for I don't even know how long.  I saw Kim today and have ended that search.  The space is modern and clean and cool.  Open and welcoming, huge windows facing the amazing Roosevelt row.  Kim immediately made me feel comfortable.  I did not have a clear vision for my hair, just a couple of pictures I kind of like.  She talked it out with me and we decided on a style.  She did a great job with my incredibly thick hair.  I left with a perfect cut. I absolutely love my hair and have found my new stylist!
