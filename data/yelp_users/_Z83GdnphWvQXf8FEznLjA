I love this store.  The staff is above and beyond amazing.  It's a good feeling when they recognize you and your children.  Tanya in the deli is such a sweet lady. As for the customers - - I have heard some awful comments from some of them.  They are mostly elderly (which is fine)..  But some of them are so judgmental and just down right rude.  I keep coming back because of the staff - -  keep up the good work!

Walgreens store itself, I have recieved nothing but great customer service.  Now the Pharmacy is a different story.  They are so unorganized and seemed so confused! Everytime I go (which I go weekly for my mother) there's someone new who doesn't know what they are doing and it's always a hassel.  I just went through the drive thru and the lady running it was arguing with a customer about his wife having to come and get her meds.  She just got out of THE HOSPITAL! SMH. My heart broke for him.  He was already upset and Walgreens made it worse.  Get your crap together Walgreens Pharmacy.
