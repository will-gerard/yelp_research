I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.  The Old Spaghetti Factory is my alltime favorite restaurant in the whole world, and has been since I was 3!  This is ALL because of their spaghetti with mizithra cheese....My mouth is watering right now just thinking about this dish.  With it's rediculously flavorful shredded goat and sheeps cheese (mizithra), and the warm brown butter and garlic sauce, this meal is decadent - but without the pricetag!  For $16 I can get this entree, with salad to start (their homemade ranch dressing is to die for), warm bread with garlic butter, dessert (spimoni or sherbert), AND a glass of wine.  The decor is also amazing - so unique and eclectic, it's got a really fun ambience - complete with dining trolley in the center of the room!  There are private rooms for even small dinner parties (I had a private room for a dinner of 4 once, and it was simply luck of the draw).    The old arcade games (think pacman) in the lobby waiting room are entertaining as well.  Basically, if I were on death row, this would be my choice for a last meal.  I have no idea how anything else tastes here, because I always order the same thing, and I always leave completely, happily, satisfied.

I am really going against my better judgment in writing this review. Am I wildly, madly in love with everything at the Royal Palms resort? Absolutely!!! Do I want you to go there?? NO! But only because I want this place completely to myself! Located off Camelback at the base of the beautiful Camelback mountain, this boutique resort is a little slice of heaven in the middle of Scottsdale. From the towering palm trees to the lush green foliage to the heady aroma of flowers everywhere you go, this place is an oasis of beauty and relaxation.   My favorite time to go to the Royal Palms is at night, when the twinkle lights wink at you from hidden corners, and candle glow from the various secluded tables light your way from nook to nook. I recommend going around 8, when the live music starts. Listen to the bluesy singer's sultry, melancholy voice as you enjoy a glass of wine on the garden patio. Or perhaps take a romantic stroll across the grounds until you come across a secret garden tucked away, waiting for you to find it.   The restaurant and bar are top notch, and have a great happy hour that lasts until 6pm Monday through Thursday. Or, if it's a hot summer day, take a little stay-cation and relax by the gorgeous pool in your own private cabana.   The entire property is enchanting, and makes you feel like you've stepped into a place where time stands still, and the only thing to do is enjoy the tranquility that surrounds you. But like I said, you really shouldn't go there......

This place is absolutely fabulous!  It has a quaint, relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff, and their bruschetta is absolutely amazing!  The portion sizes are generous, to say the least.  My friend and I split a turkey sandwich, and it was definitely more than enough to feed the both of us (with some left over!).  I would highly recommend this little gem to anyone who appreciates good food and great value.

There are so many reasons to give this Bashas only one star (or less).  My first complaint is the lack of staffing either available, or willing to help.  Rarely do they have more than one or two aisles open for checkout, and even the self service checkout is run by one of the cashiers inconveniently located at the single open checkout lane.  Therefore, anyone checking out in self service that has (1) any alcoholic beverages, (2) any coupons, (3) has to input their phone number for their Bashas "rewards" because they don't have their card with them ,(4) wants to pay by check, (5) has fruit/vegetables that don't show up on the screen as options, (6) well....you get the point - ALL have to wait for the cashier to leave their station to come re-instate your checkout after it's been frozen by the automated system.  In addition, this morning I ran into Bashas on my way to work for my staple morning Diet Coke, and EVERY lane (including all of the self checkout lanes) was roped off except one.  There were no less than 6 people in line ahead of me, all with significant groceries, and the checkout clerk (who was working at the speed of molassas) didn't call for additional assistance until 4 more people joined the line behind me.  And even then, no one came to help.    In addition to the terrible (and terribly slow) service, the location of products on occasion mystifies me.  Why is the canned tuna located in the Asian section?  Why are tortillas located at the end of the chip aisle (rather than the Mexican section?)  The don't even CARRY Truffle Oil!    The only thing I really like about this Bashas is it's cool wine chiller.  Place a room temperature bottle of wine in the chiller for no more than 4 minutes, and you're ready to join your party with a perfectly chilled Chardonnay.  That is why they get the one star I'm offering them.

OK, I have to start by saying that although I am only giving this place two stars, I still actually enjoy going here....but when you boil it down, it really is kind of a two star place (and sometimes that's exactly what you're looking for!)  From the location in the Bashas strip mall, to the wooden door with limited signage to tell you where you are, to the complete lack of any windows in the whole place, you definitely get the "tavern" feel the second you walk in.  With one long oval bar, and just a few tables against the wall, it's definitely a place to belly up to the bar for your cocktail, because the one person working the whole room might actually see you there.  The drinks are CHEAP ($2-$3 dollars for a bottle of beer, and not much more for a cocktail).  The music is....well, you decide.  It's from a jukebox.  Want food?  Go ahead and take a gander at the take out menus from local ffood joints the bartender will provide for you.  Heck, they'll even call in your order for you!  You can even bring in your own subway sandwhich and eat it if you're trying to stay healthy and avoid all that "bar food".  There is a pool table, and a few TV's to watch the game.    Mostly, I like this place just because it's around the corner from where I live.  I can walk over, get some cheap beer, and walk home.

This place was awesome!  The ambiance is sooo pretty (I am obsessed with the huge, lighted Eiffel Tower in the center of the room...just trying to figure out how to sneak out with it), and service was excellent.  I came with 5 other gabby girlfriends for dinner at 7:30, and we chatted our way through apps, dinner, drinks, and beyond.  When the bills came, all were separated individually for us, and the server made sure to let us know that gratuity was already included.  Even with the disclaimer,  several girls tipped more than the allotted amount, and the manager came back to the table with the bills to verify a SECOND time that we knew gratuity was already included (I was WAY impressed with this).  What stellar service!  After the bills had been paid, we continued to chat for almost an hour before realizing that they had probably closed at least 30 minutes prior, and we were the last table in the restaurant.  No one said a word, or made us feel as though we needed to leave (which we did immediatly when we realized our faux pas), and in fact gave us a friendly farewell when we left.  I will say the place is pretty spendy (try about $28-$55 for an entree, and all ala carte), but worth it for special occasions, especially when the service is so great.  The menu was interesting and enticing, and everything I tried was delicious (INCLUDING the Mac N Cheese!!)  I will definitely be saving up some money to come back soon!

Oh Chipotle, I love you.  Healthy options even when craving Mexican!  My favorite is the chicken burrito bowl with fajita veggies.  Served on a bed of rice with black beans and pico de gallo, with some spicy corn thrown in....ahh my mouth is watering already.  I've been to many locations, and all are clean, food quality is excellent, service is friendly and professional, and I always leave satisfied.  5 stars to you, my friend.

This review gets one star in my book, solely based on the ghastly way we were treated by management after already receiving poor service all night.  Here's what happened...  About a week prior to our visit, I called and made a dinner reservation for a table of 12 for the following Saturday night.  I requested a table outside, after confirming that there would be ample heaters should it get chilly.  I was told that would be no problem (on all counts), and the reservation was booked.  The day before our dinner, we had one more decide to join us.  I called the restaurant back, requesting that we add one more.  They again assured me that would be no problem, and confirmed the reservation on the patio, now for 13.  Three of us arrived at Grazie about 30 minutes prior to our reservation time, expecting to get a glass of wine at the bar while we waited for our group to arrive.  The hostess informed us that the table was ready, and we could just sit there if we wanted.  No problem.  When we get to the table, the only heater close to us was off, so we asked if they could turn it on.  The hostess said she would send someone right out, and that our server would be with us shortly.  Twenty minutes later, the server came over and took our wine and appetizer order (mind you, the heater is still off at this point).  We asked her again if we could have someone turn it on, and she said she'd have someone come over.  Ten minutes later our group began to arrive...and we still hadn't even received so much as a glass of water.  After another 10 minutes or so, the wine and appetizers arrived....but no silverware.   We had to wait another 15 minutes to get our waitresses attention and request silverware, and get the rest of our party's drink orders in.  In addition, we asked for the heater to be turned on again.....  Throughout dinner, service was incredibly slow, items were forgotten (my friend ordered a coffee, which came black - with no request of if she would like cream or sugar - and again it took forever to track down the server to get it)...After our 5th or 6th request to have the heater turned on, one member of the table actually went inside to ask someone else if we could get it turned on.  The waitress came back to the table and told us that the propane tank was empty, but they'd have another one moved over to our table (ummm why did they put out a heater with an empty propane tank in the first place??)..again, two or three requests later and the 'new' heater still had not been moved to the table.  All of a sudden, a busboy showed up with a lighter, and lit our ORIGINAL heater - apparently NOT empty, and about an hour and a half late.  When we received the bill, an automatic 20% gratuity was added (due to the party's size) which we felt should be disputed based on the horrible service we had received thus far.  So two of us went inside to speak to a manager about our experience.  The owner, a fairly grumpy man, let us get out two words before he started spouting all the defenses he could think of as to why the service was bad...."short staffed, not enough silverware, busier than usual, etc".  Not once was there an apology for the service received.  At one point, he interrupted me (again) to say "what is it you want from me"...I said "i'd like you to at least listen to me.  You haven't let us finish a single sentence yet"....at which point he threw up his arms and said "i don't have time for this.  It's not my fault you had bad service, that's your server's fault".  I have to say, I was incredibly impressed at his quick willingness to throw the server under the bus after already stating they were "short staffed, etc".  He then motioned over a woman who I assume was a manager, although her attitude and statements were beyond unprofessional, and said "you take care of this" (motioning in our direction).  Up to this point, we had been calm, collected and polite, but this was too much.  The woman asked what we needed, and again (one final time) tried to explain the situation and the service we had received.  Without listening to a word, she jumped in and said "I'm sorry, but do you see how busy we are??  We are FUCKING awesome.  Maybe this isn't "Your" kind of establishment".  Our jaws dropped to the floor at the rediculous rudeness and COMPLETE lack of professionalism or customer service we were witnessing.  And let me state for the record that our group consisted of several high profile professionals in the scottsdale area that would potentially take clients there as well.  My friend, pissed beyond believe at this point, stated that we would most likely not be returning if this is how they treated their customers, and that our friends would be doing the same.  She replied with "that's fine with us, clearly you don't belong here".. And when we mentioned that we would be sharing this experience with others via Yelp and word of mouth, she said (sarcastically) "Oh please do"....So here I am.  DONT GO TO GRAZIE.

I love, love, love this place!  Swings hanging from the ceiling, beer in a 40 bottle, old rickety tables, fun karaoke, beer pong in the corner, a 'spin wheel' for shots, and....of course.....other surprises.  Drinks are cheap, atmosphere is cool, and I always have a blast when I go there.  Perfect place to end the night!  I could go on for hours, but you really just need to see for yourself.

With as many times as I've frequented the Roaring Fork, I can't believe I have yet to review it.  Let me make ammends.  The Fork (as it is affectionately called to those 'in the know") is one of my all-time favorite happy hour spots in Scottsdale.  The food is delicious (I always get either the kettle of green chili pork or the rotisserie chicken flatbread), the drinks are top notch (and the pours are usually on the heavy side), the happy hour prices are awesome ($5 for a glass of wine and around that much for the apps), and the service has always been prompt and friendly.  Their patio area is nice, and some of it is covered, which allows you the ability to sit outside under shade when it's hot, or under cover when it rains.  I've not yet had the pleasure of dining here during dinner hours, and the prices sans happy hour are pretty pricey, but I've heard the food is worth it.  I can't wait to go again!

I am in love with the Roaring Fork, but only recently tried their Sunday brunch, and I have to say, it was DELICIOUS!  For only $20, you can enjoy an all you can eat buffet of some of the Fork's finest offerings, from eggs benedict, to pork and chile verde, to enchiladas, to pretty much anything else you can imagine!!  And save room for dessert, the bananas foster is heavenly!

Mulligans, I am disappointed in you.  This has previously been one of my favorite go to spots on the weekend, and I used to think of it as the perfect place to end the night.  However, it has gone downhill over the past few months, and after several horrible customer service experiences I do not think I will be frequenting this establishment again.  Let me be specific....If you mess with my money - and do so consistently and without apology...then I will not return, and I will be sure to tell as many people as I can, regardless of how "fun" your bar might be.  A few months ago, I went to Mulligans, and when ordering my drink, I asked them to just leave a tab open and handed them my card.  I ended up ordering one more beer, and then closed my $9 tab at the end of the night.  The next day after checking my bank account, I was astonished to see a $50 hold on my account from Mulligans.  I immediately called them to inform them of the error, but was told, pretty rudely, that it was standard procedure for them to hold $50 for any opened tab, and that it would just "fall off" in a few days at my bank...nothing else they could do.   They did tell me that there was a small sign on the bar that mentioned this policy, and that I should have read it first (because that's apparently what people look for or notice when they go to the bar).  Furiously, I waited for 5 business days for the funds to become available again.  A month or so later, I went in again.  Same situation, same low dollar bill, same $50 hold...although this time I just kicked myself for not remembering it the first time.  I did call the manager to ask if there was a way to avoid this other than paying cash (which I never carry), and was told that if I had closed my account after each drink rather than keep an open tab, I would just be charged for the actual dollar amount owed each time.  Good to know (although also a huge pain in the butt).  Flash foward to last week.  I went to Mulligans again, this time for St. Patricks Day.  Based on my previous conversation with the manager, I was confident that if I just closed out my tab each time, I would be fine.  I ordered one beer (specialty for $3 dollars), and closed out.  Later that night I went back and ordered two more beers (total, $6) and closed out.  The next day, I checked my account.....and found that there were TWO holds on my account from Mulligans, for $25 each.  I immediately called again and explained the situation.  The person on the phone immediately started in on their "policy" to hold funds when there is an open tab.   I told him that I had been aware of that , and that is why I closed out each time...So why I was being "held" $50 for a total of $9 was a mystery to me (and I was seriously regretting the tip at this point).  He stated "well,  the best I can tell you is to just wait for it to drop off, there's nothing we can do".  I told him that was not an acceptable solution to me, and he interrupted to say sarcastically "you really need to take this up with someone else...I'm just the barback".  So I asked him to take down my phone number and have the manager call me that night.  He took on an incredibly rude and sarcastic tone, and said (overenthusiastically)   "absolUTELY!!   I would LOVE to do that for you".  I ignored the tone and gave him my phone number anyway, and again requested that the manager call me that night.  He replied "ABSOLUTELY" again in his rediculous tone, and then hung up on me.  I never heard from the manager.  This is incredibly poor customer service, a poor way to handle your customer's money, and a really EASY way to lose business.  By the way, it's 4 days later and the funds are still being held.  This is a recession people, I go places with cheap beer for a reason!  And I can guarantee you there are a million other places to go in Scottsdale that serve $3 beers and don't do it while stealing from your pocketbook (even if it IS supposedly temporary).  I suggest staying away from this place unless you like to have your money taken and you enjoy rudeness.

Ewww.  This place is pretty gross.  I've been here once, and hope to never have to go there again.  Their 'patio' area is just a big smokers den - with ashes all over the seats and tables.  The interior smells funky and I had to wait at the empty bar for about 10 minutes to order my beer...not sure what took the bartender so long since I was the only customer at the time.  My friends lured me here in order to watch a volleyball game, promising cold beverages while watching some fun tourney action (there is a vollyball court out back).  What they failed to mention is that it's not actually part of the bar, so the frosty beverages were enjoyed(?) by myself within the barred enclosure of the patio while my friends sat on the grass about 50 feet away.  Good times I hope not to repeat.

Bridwell Automotive Center is one of my favorite places to get gas.  First, you never have to leave your car.  They come right to your window, ask what you're looking for, take your payment, and then leave you to enjoy your airconditioned vehicle while they take care of pumping the gas, checking the air in the tires, washing ALL of the windows, and they'll even check your fluids if you have an extra 30 seconds and want to pop the hood.  Every time I have been there, the attendant has been friendly, happy and helpful.  My only "complaint" is the price, but it's definitely worth it.

I am an absolute FAN of Trader Joe's! I could literally espouse their fantastic qualities for hours, but for the sake of anyone reading this, I will keep it short and sweet. Their prices are CHEAP (but are definitely NOT a reflection of the excellent quality of food and drink, etc) Their produce is always amazingly fresh. Their flower section is always stunning (and again, SO cheap it's ridiculous. I bought a huge, potted sweet basil plant for $2.99). Their wine selection is extensive, and full of quality wines as well as quirky brands I've never heard of and can find no where else. The atmosphere is clean and eco-friendly. My only complaint would be the somewhat slowness of the checkout lines. Overall, this place is my favorite place to grocery shop!

I felt like I had walked into the first level of hell when I walked through the double glass doors into the Cox Digital Store to return my cable boxes. When I walked in (carrying no less than THREE boxes, with THREE remotes perched precariously on top and wires dangling down past my ankles), there were three ladies sitting behind desks. Two had customers, one was filing her nails. There were four people ahead of me. One lady looked up and barked at me to take a seat and grab a number (very DMV-esque). Looking around for a place to set down my heavy burden, no seats were available. One guy (a true gentleman) jumped up, grabbed the boxes from me, chivalrously gave me his seat, and then snagged an extra chair from the desk of the lady who was filing her nails (she didn't even look up). After sitting for about 5 minutes, one of the customers currently being helped finished up and left. The lady helping him got up from her desk and went to the back. The other lady with no customers also got up and began boxing up cable boxes (mind you, STILL five people waiting). The third lady finished with her customer, and (thankfully) called the next number. That customer must have had a doozie of a cable issue, because when lady number two came back to her desk, and was about to call the next number, lady number one called her over to the desk to help sort out her customer's problem. Lady #3 went to the back. Meanwhile, more customers began trickling in. FINALLY, they managed to get through the line of customers ahead of me, and it was my turn (30 minutes later). I walked up with my cable boxes (none of which she offered to help me with), and when I told her I needed to return them because my service had been canceled, she just looked at me and said "you know you could have just mailed those in, right?". Um, NO! No one told me that! Would've been helpful, especially since this particular cable hell is located so far north in Scottsdale, I felt like I truly was leaving the city to go on a pilgrimage (similar to Dante's). At any rate, the rating they receive is strictly based on the service received (or not received) during that horrendous 45 minute experience.

As an Irish lass thru and thru, the promise of a cool Irish pub to get some grub and frosty guiness was enticing...and it delivered!  The food was great, our server was excellent, and they were able to accomodate our group of about 15 walkins without blinking an eye on a saturday evening (bonus points for that).  Their patio is really nice, lots of flowers and greenery and high stone walls that make you feel like you're in more of a garden than just off Mill Ave.  Overall, great place to head with friends!

This place is absolutely fabulous, for many reasons.    First and foremost, the food.  I ordered two large pizzas to go (cheese and vegetarian).  Both were absolutely delicious!  The crust is thin and light, the cheese melts in your mouth, the sauce ultra flavorful, and the veggies were fresh and cooked to perfection.  It was a definite hit with everyone.  The location is a bit hidden (it's in an industrial neighborhood), but still very convenient as it is right across the street from Tempe Marketplace.  The interior was charming, with brick walls and small tables - reminescint of what I envision a small pizza parlor in Italy to look and feel like.  Although the prices are higher than you would find at a Dominos or Pizza Hut, so is the quality of the food - therefore, worth the extra few bucks.  Finally, the staff was amazing.  I had approached the manager for a small food donation for a local charity, and he went above and beyond to provide us with ample food for all involved and made our charity experience that much more memorable.  Overall, this place is definitely worth a stop (or two, or three)!

I could literally write about my love affair with Scottsdale Fashion Square for hours...days....weeks....years....and STILL not have fully expressed my absolute devotion to this mecca of shopping malls.  So I will keep this brief.  They have every store you could possibly ever wish for (and so many you never knew you needed until you venture inside).  They stores range in pricetag from budget (think Charlotte Russe and Forever 21) to rediculously opulent (hello, Barneys.....hello, Neiman Marcus), and everything in between.  The movie theater is a fabulous place to meet friends for a Sunday matinee, and the pet store has arguably the cutest puppies on the planet - always.  The food court COULD offer a bit better selection, although with Paradise Bakery and Pita Jungle in the mix, I'm definitely not complaining.  I could spend many a happy day here just wandering the aisles, hopping from store to store, and basking in the joyous glow that is ME at Fashion Square.

My first experience at Bobby's has left me less than excited to come back, and certain aspects of my visit were downright terrible. Let me explain...   Several friends and I decided to head to Bobby's for happy hour on Friday night. Four of us arrived at 5pm, and we were expecting 2 more. When we walked in, the ambiance of the place was really nice. It had a cool vibe to it, and cool wall hangings and lighting, so my first impression was pretty good. When we walked upstairs to the bar, we were informed that only the high-top tables were available for happy hour. They were all 4 person tables, and we knew we would have at least 6 people. We sat down at one of the tables, and asked our server if it would be possible to add two more chairs. She was hesitant, but then suggested we move two tables together instead. That was fine by us. But instead of pushing a table to the one we were already seated at, they pushed two others together that were closer to the walkway and stairs. Once together, we got up and moved. Not 5 minutes later, the manager stomped over to us and said (pretty heatedly) "you guys can't sit here, you're right in the way. This isn't going to work". He didn't offer a solution, and was extremely accusatory. I informed him that his servers had been the one to relocate us, and he just repeated "this isn't going to work". Finally, he told us we could move to one of the regular tables and still get the happy hour deals, so the servers moved two more tables together, and we moved again. FINALLY, we were settled and began ordering our drinks and food. Shortly thereafter, we had two more friends join....and then two more that had never told us they were coming. So we added chairs for them and made room. Immediately after doing so, the manager came storming back over, and pulled our server aside. He was gesturing angrily and pointing at our table, and you'd think we'd committed some sort of atrocity with the was he was glaring at us. Let me include an aside - I get that it messes with the flow of the restaurant when patrons move chairs or tables from where they are normally located. HOWEVER, the place was half empty. Not once during the entire evening was every table filled. In addition, everyone at our table ordered multiple drinks and appetizers, so it's not as if we had space fillers that were not producing any income. After the manager finished yelling at our server, I called her over to apologize to her for the inconvenience. It wasn't her fault, and there was no reason the manager should have been so angry with her (or us, for that matter). Finally, we were done, and the bill came. We each put our share in, and the server took the bill to the back. When she returned, she handed out the credit card slips. Mine was for approximately $22, and she gave me mine without comment. I just discovered today, though, that she originally ran my card for the entire bill of almost $200! She apparently canceled it out, but because it was input into the system, it is still showing as a pending item in my bank account, which is $200 less than it should be now. It would have been nice if the server had mentioned that, rather than be surprised by it now 4 days later. Who knows how long it will take to fall out of pending status, and what if I had needed that money for something else???   In addition to this horrible experience, I will add that the food was nothing more than average. The cheese tortellini was extremely bland, and the crab cakes in the crab cake and lobster ravioli dish tasted just like frozen fish sticks. The bruschetta was pretty good, but it's pretty hard to mess up tomatoes on toast.   Overall, this visit was sub-par, and I'm not sure I'll be going back anytime soon.  Update - After writing this review, I felt it necessary to contact the owner and let them know what happened.  I explained the situation, and the owner was profusely apologetic and assured me she would take the necessary steps to ensure that this didn't happen again.  She invited me to come back and give them another chance, and I will.  I'll let you know how it goes....

This place is the quintessential neighborhood deli / eatery on weekend mornings, and a fabulous little pizza parlor in the evenings.  It's hard to pull off both in the same location, but La Grande Orange does it amazingly well!  The food is delicious, although a little on the spendy side in my opinion (Think $7.50 - $10 for an egg sandwich, a la carte)They also have tons of little knick knacks, tshirts, and plants for sale, and a little wine shop in the corner!  The only downside is the parking (almost impossible) and the lack of space when it's busy (which is almost always).  But if you don't mind eating your sandwich in a cramped corner next to the door, you're gonna be hard pressed to find anything else you DON'T like about this place.  Highly recommended!

OMG. If you want a taste of Latin heaven, you must try Deseo at the Westin Kierland Resort and Spa. I was whisked away to this beautiful restaurant by the BF (who works at the Westin), under the impression of having "a drink or two". And boy did we. The mojitos our mixologist created for us were simply to die for, and I would be hard pressed to state my favorite. The Mango Mojito, The Strawberry Mojito, and even their standard were all amazing (and I tried them ALL).   But on top of their delicious mojito selection, the food was simply the best. Our waitress (tipped off by the BF to just bring us her favorites), first brought out the Lobster Civiche with avocado tempura in a sweet/spicy sauce. Words cannot express the deliciousness or quality of this meal. The lobster was cooked perfectly, the avocado tempura was a perfect accent, and I couldn't get enough of the sauce - we asked for more bread just to mop it all up. My mouth is literally watering right now just remembering this dish.   Next up, another civiche with fresh ahi tuna, salmon, and whitefish, mixed with cilantro and jalapenos. Again, simply divine. The fish melted in my mouth.   After both of these, we tried the popcorn curried shrimp, the tender flank steak, and the millionaire tiny tuna tacos. ALL were of the freshest quality and the most distinct flavors imaginable.   Finally, our waitress brought out the dessert - a chocolate cigar with cappuccino mousse and candy matches. It was a masterpiece in and of itself.   My only comment after this amazing meal would be this - All of the food was amazing, but I probably shouldn't have started with the Lobster Civiche. I prefer to save the best for last!

What a fun place!  If you're in the mood for some bbq or steak, this is a great place to try!  I loved the western atmosphere, and the food I tried was all delicious.  I LOVED bbq chicken, but pretty much everything I sampled was up to par.  Also, if you're staying here...the pool is awesome.

What a fabulous place to meet friends for lunch after a few hours of holiday shopping!!! Right across the street from Fashion Square, this place is in a prime location for shoppers to rest their weary feet and escape from the frantic craze that is Christmastime at the mall. All of their food is delicious, but my personal favorite combo is the Chicken, pine nut, tomato & Gorgonzola salad with the wild mushroom and truffled arugula pizza (split between friends). The pizzas are mostly all under $10 a piece, and if you're not starving and don't want to share, you can get one of their many pasta sides and leave it at that. I like to enjoy a glass of wine with my lunch, and they have plenty to choose from. In the summertime, they even have a $20 special that gets you a pizza, salad, and two glasses of wine. That's $10 bucks each for you and a friend! The only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because the interior decor is seriously lacking (reminds me of a nice cafeteria), and you aren't able to take your wine to any of the outside tables because their patio is not closed off to the sidewalk. Overall, though, this place rocks!

I went to The Vig twice this weekend, and both times it was awesome.  On Sunday, I went for breakfast after going to the gym.  We sat outside on their gorgeous outdoor patio, right next to the fire.  The food was amazing (I had a sandwich, even though it was breakfast time - the sliced prime rib with aus jus - YUM), and the service was great.  On Monday, I spontaneously decided to hit it up for happy hour, and had an equally excellent experience.  "My" table by the fire was open, so we sat there again! Happy hour was awesome (wings were delicious, as were the sliders) Bonus - on Monday nights, you can get a full burger with fries (regular or sweet potato) for only $5!  They have bocce ball outside, and even the interior feels open and airy.  I definitely want to go back soon!

I love, love, love this dog park (and so does my Great Dane, Charlie).  It's beautifully maintained, clean, and welcoming to dogs of all sizes (which is good since my dog weighs more than I do).  It's easily accessible, right on the greenbelt, and offers a place where your dogs can run free and socialize, without having to worry about them running into traffic.  It's also a GREAT place for people to socialize as they wait for their pups to tucker themselves out.  There are lots of shady benches to meet and great other dog lovers.  The best part - It's completely FREE!  I definitely give Chaparral Dog Park 5 stars.

This review is two-fold.  Part one - about the store:  This is my all-time favorite store to window-shop in.  I can only dream of the day when I win the lottery and can afford to purchase all the beautiful clothing, accessories, and home decor.  To be fair, not everything is highly priced, and they have a large selection of sales items that are within my budget...but I swear, if I won the lottery, it would be my first stop (2nd stop, Z Gallery).  It's always beautifully decorated and has a lovely cozy/eclectic feel to it that I absolutely adore.  They also carry my favorite perfume there.  As a general rule, I never buy myself perfume, because I always get some for Christmas (this is on the xmas list this year!), but the sales associates always look the other way when I come in just to spray it on myself before going out for the night...tacky, I know...but it smells sooooooo delicious.  Part two - My apologies to the sales associates that delt with my crabby, frustrated, snotty attitude the night you couldn't find the item I had put on hold.  Apparently, a friend had come in to purchase the item as a gift to me.  After searching forever, one sales clerk 'in the know', finally came over and explained that the item had been purchased as a gift, and warned me to act surprised.  I sheepishly left, but still feel that an apology is due.  The sales clerks handled my attitude graciously and courteously, and I wanted to recognize that as a HUGE reason why I will continue to frequent this amazing store (sorry again!!). :)

Let me begin by telling you about my horribly debilitating fear of going to the dentist.  It's epic.  Weeks before an appointment I start having nightmares.  Thinking about sitting in the dental chair makes me break out in a cold sweat.  I require nitris oxide for a simple cleaning. The sound of the drill is enough to make me want to claw my face off.  Basically, every visit has been the worst experience ever for the past 30 years....  Enter Dr. Marcia Blazer.  I read about her online when searching for a local dentist here in Scottsdale.  I literally googled "dentists for anxious patients", and her name popped up.  Her website appeared too good to be true.  They offered nitris (plus), offered non invasive options for dental procedures (double plus), and offered a staff used to accomodating those with a healthy dose of dental fear.  I went in for my first visit (a cleaning and exam), and I was amazed at how comfortable they made me feel.  They were warm and friendly, and put me at ease immediately.  During the cleaning, my least favorite part is always when they use the scrapy,pointy torture device to stab off all the plaque at the gumline.  How happy was I when they used an air abrasion tool instead...felt like a cool stream of water on your teeth, and BAM, they're clean!  They were so calming, that when I was informed that I had 2 cavities, I didn't even have a panic attack at the thought of coming in.  Fast forward two weeks to my filling appointment.  I had requested nitris (hey, I was feeling better but still SUPER anxious), which they had all set up in the room for me when I walked in.  Now here's my favorite part.  As I sat in the chair, the assistant brought over two big boxes full of dvd's and asked me what movie I would like to watch during the procedure...What?? So I picked a lighthearted comedy (50 First Dates).  I was then given noise eliminating headphones to use (goodbye horrible drilling sound), nitris (hello happy gas), and a few hand signals to recognize if I was supposed to open or close my mouth.  And we were off!  She didn't try to maintain conversation (soooo annoying when dentists do that), and before I knew it she was done and I was disappointed because my movie wasn't quite over!  I was even told that had my dentist not needed the room I was in for another patient, that I would have been welcome to stay and just finish the movie!  I have had several interactions with this office since then (regarding billing and follow up), and every time it is a pleasure to deal with them.  I highly recommend this office to anyone!

Any time I am in the mood for a delicious salad or a hot cup of soup (which is often), Paradise Bakery is the absolute first place I think about.    The food is amazing (Caesar Salad - yum.  Chicken Noodle Soup - yum. Turkey Sandwich - double yum).  I also love (and hate) that you get a FREE cookie with your order.  Yes, that's right - Free.  The place is always clean and welcoming, and for someone that HATES to wait in line, I never mind here because they are quick, friendly, and efficient, and I can nibble on samples while I wait.  Basically, this place is my soup/salad/sandwich superstar!

Stax.  The word does not reference the size of the burgers available at this bistro, but more the vast quantity of ingredients available to stack ONTO your little patty of heaven.   Start with options of meat such as Kobe beef, wagyu, ostrich, duck, lamb, turkey, and black bean (some are standard, and some are available only on special).    Time to add some toppings.  Any cheese of choice...veggies, sauces, whole grains, foie gras, pretty much anything you can think of!  Purchase them one at a time, or get a bunch of different ones to share at the table.  For those of you that have a hard time making decisions, just flip the menu over and select from one of the house favorites (all the ingredients are pre-selected for you).    Then move onto the sides....my personal favorite - the tator tots (although the sweet potato fries are a close second).  Again with the choices - do you want bbq sauce to dip them in, or ranch?  Chipotle aoli, or pepper sauce?  The list goes on and on!    Finally - pick a frosty beer or fruity cocktail to enjoy along with your meal, or just sip on the cucumber water brought to the table.    What I love about Stax is that it is casual, but chic.  The food is delicious, but affordable.  The portions are small, but still shareable.  They have a fabulous happy hour, and offer great specials on the weekends if you're looking for a place to chill on the patio and drink/eat the day away.  And it's right in the heart of Old Town!  Definitely one of my faves!

How cool is Su Vino!!?!  I went here for the first time a few weeks ago, and was totally impressed.  As Scottsdale's own local winery, they have tasting menus at affordable prices, and some super delicious wines!  Small appetizers also abound, and the Caprese was sooo yummy!  We went on a Saturday night, and were entertained by local musician Matthew Thornton....such a treat!  I highly recommend this place for a nice glass of wine and a relaxing atmosphere!

Ode to Taco Tuesday   Cien Agave, how I love thee  Where else can I go to get tacos for free!?  Well, technically they are not free, but still  Only $1 a piece, it's an absolute steal!   Your Tecate Light is so refreshing and crisp  And at only $2, I can have multiple sips!  If darker beer is more your fare,  Have a Modelo, it's not that much more!   The tequila you serve makes your Margs quite delish  All food so divine, I have only one wish!  Only one day a week is not enough, I say  Let's celebrate Taco Tuesday EVERY DAY!   TT fans - this little poem sums it up! If you want cheap food and drinks, good service, cool ambiance, and just an overall place to go, Cien Agave's on Tuesday nights is the place for you!

The Chambord Margaritas here should come with a warning label!  Soooo delicious, but lethal to your sobriety. In fact, the restaurant enforces a strict 2 margarita max, and for good reason!  I happened to finish a third once (handed over by a friend that couldn't handle any more), and we spent a hilarious afternoon walking off the tequila inside Fashion Square, and instigating purchases of each other that were well outside of our budget...but I digress.  Z Tejas has some amazing food and drink options to suit any palate.  From apps (try their tableside guacamole or chili pork verde), to steaks and seafood (grilled miso salmon is amazing), to specialties (santa fe smoked chicken enchiladas, mmmmmmmm).  They also offer gluten free and vegetarian options!  One down side - I asked if they offered mac and cheese, and was told to order the Diablo Pasta....soooooo disappointing, and definitely NOT mac N cheese!  Their hh runs from 3-6:30, so they get mixed marks for that...good that they last past 6, but I'd REALLY prefer them to offer it until 7.    Their atmosphere is pretty laid back and comfortable, while still looking classy and contemporary.  Service has also never been an issue here.  This is one of my favorite happy hour locations, although I don't love that if you want to sit on the 'patio', you are actually basically sitting in a valet garage - not ideal.    I do love their queso dip, and as I stated in the beginning, the chambord margarita is to die for...so I say check this place out!!

Looking for a place to whet your whistle next Saturday or Sunday afternoon? As a huge proponent of Sunday Funday, I have to recommend Saddle Ranch as one of my all time faves. While Old Town Scottsdale is known for its plethora of nightlife, it's day-drinking scene can sometimes be overlooked. With a huge outdoor area that comes complete with ceiling fans, covered tables, and misters (a definite necessity if you're eating outside in AZ anytime of the year between April and October), its a patio-lover's paradise!   The food is delicious, and the portions are definitely sharing-sized. My go-to hangover meal is always the baked green chili and jack macaroni and cheese. I consider myself somewhat of a Mac N Cheese connoisseur, and honestly - this dish is heavenly!   The best part of spending your Saturday or Sunday morning/afternoon at Saddle are the drink specials. All of their specialty mimosas and bloody marys are only $2 a piece until 3pm! If you like your bloody spicy, I recommend the Jalapeno one - it's definitely got some kick!   If you really want to do it right, I recommend arriving around 11am (it's busier once the football games start), bring some friends and your board game of choice (my friends and I are partial to Apples to Apples), spread yourselves out on a roomy patio table, and settle in for a day of cheap drinks and lots of laughs. Just tell the waitress to keep those mimosa's coming!!

This place is great! From the outside it's pretty nondescript, but once inside it's a charming Italian eatery and wine bar that solicits the feel of old Italy without the expensive cost of airfare and lodging. They have also recently undergone renovations that have increased their size by almost double! The food is delicious (the antipasto is excellent, as is the Tuscan white bean salad), and their wine list is quite extensive! They also offer delicious specialty cocktails if wine is not your forte. Their happy hour menu includes a large selection of their every day menu items, and drinks are heavily discounted. Also, depending on the night, wine bottles are half off! I would absolutely recommend this place to friends and family looking for a good place to relax and enjoy some Italian fare!

LOVE THIS PLACE!  First of all, let me give kudos for extending their happy hour to 8PM (starts at 4pm).....wait for it......SEVEN DAYS A WEEK!!!!  When most other bars in old town have doubled their drink prices an hour or two prior, Daily Dose's happy hour is still going strong, which is reason enough for me to love them.  Throw in the fact that their happy hour food menu extends waayyyy beyond your average "bar food" (try chorizo mac and cheese or the portobello mushroom and brie fondue) and their drink specials are pretty darn good, and we have ourselves a winner!  The only reason this place gets four stars out of five is because, due to the fact that they are EVER so popular, the wait to get into this little piece of heaven can be quite lengthy.  But I'm always glad I stuck it out!

A group of friends and I decided to check out Vincent's Saturday Market this past weekend after a beautiful morning hike had worked up our appetites.  When we got there, the place was packed (but still had space to accomodate our group of 6).  It was the perfect outdoor market feel, with fresh vegetables from the garden available for purchase, next to organic lotions and soaps, and all sorts of food stands to whet any appetite (crepes, tacos, paninis, etc).  There was even a mimosa stand, where for $20 you could purchase a bottle of champagne, a glass of OJ, and as many plastic cups as needed.  This is definitely going to be added to my list of favorite places to enjoy a beverage while observing some extremely entertaining people watching!  I loved it, and hope to go again soon!

Preface:  I am reviewing Avalon based on my happy hour experience, I have not yet had the pleasure to enjoy the full dining experience, although I hear it is good.  I met some friends here last week, and had a pretty good time.  I'm fluctuating between 3 1/2 stars and 4 stars, so I'll just round up.  The good and the bad:  *  The happy hour prices are not the cheapest.  Only $2 dollars off glasses of wine and beer, and both are already overpriced in my opinion.  * The happy hour food menu was small...and the one item we tried to order they were out of.  * They apparently have amazing bread with dipping sauce, that a friend had sampled on a previous visit.  When we tried to order it though, we were told that they only brought it out with the order of an entree.  Since none of us were staying for dinner, we offered to just pay for the bread.  Their response "ehh, management is pretty strict on the bread policy" (side note - when we informed them that one member of our group actually needed to eat for medical reasons, they brought the bread out free of charge)  * The service was great.  Our server was friendly and sweet.  *  The ambience is classy and charming - think Fox Concepts -esque.  Very nice, kinda swanky - which also is a juxtoposition with the fact that its kind of hidden and surrounded by office buildings.  Not a location you would think of for fine dining  As I said, I haven't tried their food yet, but will certainly go back again at dinner time and give it a shot!

What a great place to enjoy some outdoor hiking/biking/walking!  Situated just next to Piestewa Peak, the 32nd and Lincoln trailhead is easily accessible (although popular, so you might have to park across the street), and excellently maintained.  The difficulty level depends on which trail you take, and how far you go.  It starts of as a gentle slope, but the further you go, the steeper it gets.  I have no idea of the distance we travelled, but we hiked for a total of 1.5 hours (ish), and there were a few parts that were pretty strenuous.  Excellent workout, beautiful scenery, and 75 degree weather (in January) made for a lovely hike!

Looking for hiking that's close to the city, but still makes you feel like you are in the middle of nowhere?  Try the McDowell Mountains!  Just 8(ish) miles past Fountain Hills, it only take about 25 minutes to drive there from the heart of Scottsdale, and you literally feel like you're out in the wilderness.  There are covered picnic areas and restrooms at the base of the trails, and the trails are excellently maintained.  Some paths are wide enough to accomodate horseback riding, if that's your thing.  It's pet friendly (just clean up after them!), and the trails go on for miles.  You can do a 3 mile trekk (to the top and back), or even go crazy and do the 20 mile loop!  It is rare to run into others on the mountain, which is a nice break from the chaos that is Squaw Peak or Camelback during peak hiking season. I can't remember the name of the trail I like to do, but it's about 3 miles long and takes you to the top of a small mountain that has a beautiful stone bench at the top where you can sit and enjoy a sunrise or sunset with 360 degree views.  It's remote, and absolutely stunning.  I took my boyfriend there for a romantic sunset picnic on his birthday, and we had an amazing time!  I definitely recommend this place for all nature lovers and hikers.

I have had two exceptionally good experiences with Marcella's Italian Kitchen.  The first was a 30 person birthday party in one of their private dining rooms.  From the moment the reservation was made, the staff were courteous, friendly, and helpful.  They offered our choice of a full or limited menu (we opted for the full menu), and even offered the choice of allowing us to split checks at the end of the meal (which at 30+ guests was unheard of, but soooo appreciated).  Our service was prompt and our waitstaff managed to keep the bread and wine coming all night long while we waited patiently for our entrees.  The only reason I give them 4 stars out of 5 are due to one or two dishes that were good, but rather bland (these being the Fettucine Alfredo and their dumpling dish).  I did however sample thier shrimp and goat cheese pizza and the pasta with lamb ragu, and both were superb.  Even when we had an additional 15+ guests arrive halfway through dinner, the staff graciously pulled up more tables to accomodate the unexpected turnout.  Overall, an excellent experience.  My second visit was for happy hour, and this definitely blew my expectations out of the water.  The prices are phenomenal (half of all wine and cocktails, and $5 pizzas, just to name a few), and our bartender was more of an artist than beverage pourer.  His attention to detail on each martini ordered (try the grapefruit basil one!) not only garnered excellent results, but it was entertaining to watch!  I will definitely be marking Marcella's as one of my new favorite happy hour hotspots!

I signed up for the LivingSocial deal offered through Abby Bella as part of a New Years resolution to be more active, and attended my first class last night.  It was aweseme!  The class was called "stretch and tone" (both things that are hugely necessary for me), and the majority of the class was done at the ballet bar.  So fun!  The instructor was awesome, and took time to go around and adjust everyone's postures and positioning to make sure it was done correctly.  Before I knew it, the hour was over, and I am super excited to go again.  The other classes offered are also extremely appealing.  Think Zumba, Yoga, Pilates, Cardio Striptease, Bombshell Burlesque, and Hip Hop - among others.  I signed up for their 30 day challenge (I must attend one class a day for 25 of the 30 days), and with so many classes to choose from it will be difficult to even repeat one anytime soon!  Looking forward to seeing what the rest of the classes have to offer, but if my first experience is an indicator, I think it's going to be amazing!!

Well I am FIRMLY sticking to my 5 star review!  After attending two more classes at Abby Bella (Cardio Striptease and Bella Barre), I am hooked!  This place has amazing classes that are suited for every fitness level.  The instructors are all enthusiastic and fun, and everyone has been so welcoming in each class, I feel like I've been going there forever!!  I'll be seeing them again tonight at Zumba!

OK, for someone who lived in Oregon for years (home of many nationally owned and thousands of locally owned coffee shops), and studied in Vienna (practically the birthplace of the coffee (cafe') salon), I am extremely particular about my coffee shops.  Buzzberry ranks as one of my favorites here in the valley, for many reasons.  Soooo much cozier than your typical Starbucks, the atmosphere is fun and eclectic, with random pieces of furniture set to allow the feel of multiple smaller 'living room' type areas to sit with friends.  They also have outdoor tables, and while I wouldn't necessarily call it a "patio' area, it still gets the job done when the weather in Phx is nice enough to allow outdoor seating.  The coffee choices are great, and their smoothies are AMAZING!! I am partial to a blend of tangerine/peach that is to die for, but you can pretty much create your own - and they're all natural.  Lets get to breakfast.  They offer typical coffee shop fare such as muffins and bagels, and some soup and sandwich selections as well if you happen to be there at lunchtime.  But my ALL TIME favorite is Sunday brunch, where you can get a made-to-order omelette with cheesy potatoes and a croissant that make you wish every day was Sunday morning!  The staff are so friendly and helpful, and the owner, Kate, is absolutely charming.  They also offer free WiFi for those that want to get caught up on emails or schoolwork outside the home.  My friends and I spend hours here every weekend, just being lazy and enjoying each other's company.  I suggest you do the same!

I am a fan of every Fox Concepts restaurant that I have had the pleasure of visiting, but Culinary Dropouts is one of my favorites!!  I love the cool ambiance (plush overstuffed chairs, purple walls, massive chandaliers), and the patio area is seriously awesome.  Their happy hour is great (try the Saurkraut Martini - I swear by it), and their food is amazing.  This GastroPub serves your 'typical' bar food - with a suave twist.  Try the shaved prime rib sandwich with a cup of delicious french onion soup to dip it in.  Or try the butternut squash ravioli (soooo yummy).  Everything I have had off their menu, from apps to dinner to dessert (the monkey bread is fabulous - and NOT just because it has the word monkey in it) has been mouthwatering.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.

For a tanning salon, Darque Tan on Scottsdale and Shea gets top marks. Recently, I decided that although summer was over, my healthy summer glow didn't have to disappear. A friend recommended Darque Tan, and I went in for some information. Let me tell you, I have tanned countless times before, at countless salons NEVER have I received such excellent service from such a friendly, patient and knowledgeable staff member. Usually, tanning salons are staffed with high school girls looking for some extra cash for the weekend who are not at all interested in being overly helpful if it takes them away from texting at the counter. NOT my experience in this case though. The employee walked me through a very thorough explanation of their membership pricing and options, pointing out various deals and discounts along the way. She gave me a full tour of the property and patiently answered all of my questions (and I had PLENTY - if I'm going to spend approx. $80/month for a tanning membership it better be worth it!). She then walked me through the various tanning lotions provided, breaking them down by cost, level of bronzing, even smell!   On top of the excellent service I received, I also have to rave about the facility itself. Darque Tan may be more expensive than other tanning salons around (although packages CAN run from $22/$48 month with upgrade options), but their beds are well worth the extra cash. They offer level 1 - level 5 beds, stand up beds, beds with misters and multiple fans, spray tanning, etc. ALL beds are nice, comfortable, and new. Even with the lowest package available, you're still going to get a nice bed - and you never run the risk of getting put in the crap bed that 's been there since 1984.   Lets see, what else....There are no appointments required, and they always have plenty of beds available to walk in. They have several locations in the valley, and your membership is valid at all of them. There are no contracts to sign. If you pay for a package, your package stays till you use it (no expiration date) even if you quit your membership.   Basically, this place is awesome. I'm a fan!

I'm torn on my rating for the new El Chorro Lodge.  I had visited the "old" El Chorro Lodge prior to the renovations, and enjoyed it (although I found the bar area seriously lacking).  But last weekend was my first trip to the upgraded version, and it was a mixed bag.  First of all, let me say that if I were rating on ambience alone, this place would get a solid 5 stars.  Their patio area is extensive, and there are so many cozy nooks with semi-private fireplaces scattered around that it's easy to find a quiet corner to relax in with your special someone.  The bar area has been increadibly re-done, and is beautiful!  My friend and I sat at the bar, and were entertained by the live band playing just a few steps away.    Now the downside.  The bartender that helped us (there were at least three behind the bar) was just ok.  He was very friendly, and very enthusiastic, but didn't seem very knowledgeable.  We asked him for drink specials, and were told there were none.  We asked for drink recommendations, and he had none.  We asked if they offered specialty martini's, and were told..."um....we have the El Chorro Martini"....finally we asked for the drink menu, and found that there actually were a BUNCH of different specialty cocktails and martinis that all looked appealing.    I ordered a beer (I know, I know, after all that....but it sounded delicious), and my friend ordered one of the specialty martinis with basil.  After 5 minutes I got my beer.  After 10 minutes, still no cocktail for my friend.  We mentioned it to another bartender, who told us that he'd pass it along.  Then our bartender came back and began to make the drink....slowly....Finally, when it looked like it was ready to be presented, our bartended said "oh....I need to make you a new one.  The basil I used is still dirty"......and the process began again.  Once the drink was received, it tasted great and we enjoyed the rest of our evening.  I guess I'm going to give four stars as an average for the 5 star ambience and 3 star service received.  But I will definitely be going back soon.

I'd never been to Smashburger, but had heard good things, so when Yelp offered an event here that provided a free entree and sample of their new shake, I jumped on the opportunity.  I was not disappointed!  I ordered the Arizona burger (jalapeno peppers, guacamole, and a spicy mayo), and my friend ordered the Mushroom Swiss burger.  Both were delicious!  Definitely a good quality burger, and the fries were pretty good too!  The shake was really good as well.  The atmosphere was clean and bright, and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  I'd definitely come here again when I get the urge for a good burger.

I go back and forth between 3 and 4 stars for RnR in Scottsdale.  Over the summer, they had a phenominal bottomless mimosa special...$10 for unlimited mimosas from open until 2pm on Saturdays and Sundays.  But now that it's football season, and they aren't quite as new, they've upped the prices.  $15 bottomless mimosa special - here's the catch - with the purchase of an entree.  Now, I will say that they aren't ALWAYS super strict about that catch, and sometimes as long as one person at the table orders, they consider it good enough.    Their food is pretty good, although one of my friends complained that almost every dish came with bacon, which she found gross.  She even ordered a bloody mary that had a slice of crispy bacon stuck in it (ewww) As someone who loves bacon, tho, I don't mind.  The prices for the food are pretty steep in my opinion.  My favorite is their absolutely AMAZING baked mac N cheese dish (with spicy pepperjack cheese and bread crumbs on top) for only $5 (portion is small).  Anyone who has read some of my other reviews knows that a good mac N cheese dish qualifies a whole extra star all on its own.  Another quick tip - if you 'friend' RnR on facebook, you will recieve daily 'code phrases' that will provide excellent discounts for the alloted timefram (usually 1/2 off wine or martinis, or hh specials all night long) if whispered to your server.  Overall, good food, decent service, kinda spendy, but fun.  Oh, and their upstairs patio is awesome.

I will keep this short and sweet, since this is a grocery store.  I LOVE this place.  The food is cheap, the store is clean, the produce FRESH (hence the name), and the staff ultra friendly.  This place makes my grocery shopping experience pleasant and EASY (also, hence the name).  I'd recommend this place to anyone!

Think you have a good voice, and love to sing??  OR do you love to watch people make a fool of themselves in front of others.  If EITHER of these describes you, you're gonna love Ernies.  Known for it's offering of nightly karaoke, Ernies provides young and old vocalists/entertainers alike the stage to belt their heart out to all of their favorite songs.  What I really like about Ernies is that for those that truly do come here to actively participate, it's not full of 'regulars' that run the show - leaving you lucky to get one song in at the end of the night, and only if you've slipped the karaoke master a $20 (as has been my experience with the OTHER karaoke bar in Old Town Scottsdale that shall remain nameless) The bar is not fancy by any means, but it's nice and clean.  The drinks are cheap.  Not into singing?  Try one of their other rooms.  They have pool tables, rooms for dining (I've never tried their food, so I can't speak to that), and lots of places to stand/sit/observe.  I did notice that some other reviews have commented on the karaoke people not allowing them to sing without tipping first, and that has not yet been my experience there.  I've found them to be fair and keep to a good rotation.  This place is a blast to go with a group, too!

I visited The Nest last night with a few friends, and would have to say I was rather impressed!  I love being scared, I'm obsessed with haunted ANYTHING, and Halloween is one of my favorite holidays.  With that being said, the last few years choices in haunted abodes have been lacking in the fright department.  But The Nest delivered more than a handful of jumps, scares and shrieks around each bend!  Even the ghouls and goblins that roamed the dusty streets while waiting in line were entertaining to watch, and made the 45 minute wait to get in seem to fly by fairly quickly.  The special effects were pretty decent, and the actors were VERY invested in being as spooky as possible.  I was actually cornered by two very creepy, very bloody escaped mental patients that refused to let me pass.  I had to duck, cover and roll (just about), just to get to the next room!  Scary for me, and entertaining for all the friends that went with me.  The cost ($25 pp, but on Sundays only $15pp if you buy a family 4-pack) was worth it.  The only downside is the distance from Old Town, but it's well worth it to venture outside The Bubble for a night of fright!

I had the pleasure of being one of only 30 attendees to the grand opening of Los Taquitos Mexican Grill last night, and I was absolutely impressed!!  The menu features all of your mexican favorites, from street tacos to burritos to quesadillas to a delicious shrimp civiche.  The food is exceptionally priced (think around $5.00 or less for pretty much any item), but is no indication of the excellent quality and delicious flavors that await you in every bite!  The margaritas were absolutely phenomenal, and had I not been the driver, I would have been stuck there for hours just trying all of the different flavors available (such as Blood Orange, Prickly Pear, and Pomegranite).  Their salsa selection was also extensive, ranging from a light, tangy Pico de Gallo, to their uber-spicy jabenero salsa (eat with caution!!).  The location is convenient, the atmosphere was fun and casual (the place is small, but cute), the patio area (although tiny) was nice (and covered), and the owners were all SO friendly. Yes it was the Grand Opening, but I was still impressed that ALL involved made the effort to mingle with each table, introduce themselves, and chit chat throughout the evening.  Overall, I give this place a solid two thumbs up!

When a friend asked me to meet her at The Spotted Donkey, I had no idea what to expect.  It had just recently opened, and the name (although intriguing) didn't necessarily solicit mouthwatering images.  However, I was fantastically surprised to find that this place is one of the newer hidden gems in Scottsdale!  The ambiance and decor are fun and interesting, there's lots of seating, and their patio area is awesome!  Hidden in a shopping strip mall, you'd never guess from the outside that an oasis of fabulous food and drink awaited you right behind those dark paned doors.  I sampled several of their specialty margaritas and other concoctions, and all were delicious, but my all time favorite was the Blood Orange Margarita.  The food was also great (tried the calamari, guacamole, quesadilla, and queso dip), and the staff was friendly and helpful.  My favorite part about this place is their devotion to happy hour (almost as great as mine).  They offer hh every day of the week, and on the weekends, it is offered from opening (at 11am) until 6pm.  It's the perfect place to spend an afternoon!  I will definitely be going there again soon!

Ummmmm.....cheap champagne in a cool, loungy atmosphere?  Yes please!  This place almost instantly made it to the top of my list of happy hour locations when we were presented with our first round of rose' champagne on the house, simply because I had a "membership card" (free to anyone that requests it) and this was my first time using it!  (The membership card allows you to rack up points based on your bill at the end of each visit, and you can cash in those points for various perks).   We went on a Thursday, which is ladies night.  So even though happy hour typically lasts until 7 (and includes such things as $5 bubbles and half off well drinks), on Thursdays those prices are extended for the ladies until 8pm!!  The food also looked appetizing!  I snacked on some of the 'toasts' my friends ordered, and they were delicious!  Basically, I plan to make this a regular Thursday night hangout, and can't wait to go again!

I was lucky enough to participate in Cafe Zupas Pre-Opening event last week, and I have to say I was impressed!  The ambience was cool, and included comfy booths and a 'bar' seating area with ipod docks and a place to set your laptops.  The staff was friendly and helpful, and allowed me to sample several different types of soups before settling on one.  And the food:  Delicious!  I actually loved it so much, I went back the next day to try something else, and everything I tasted was fantastic!  The first day, I had the Yucatan Chicken Tortilla soup (with sour cream, cheddar cheese, guacomole, and tortilla strips on top!) and the California Turkey sandwich (turkey, avocado, tomatoes, sprouts, cucumbers, mixed greens, muenster cheese, and ranch dressing).  Both were absolutely amazing, and I also got a chocolate dipped strawberry on the side, which comes with any soup or salad.  For dessert, I tried the cheesecake, and managed to eat half before feeling like I was going to explode.  it was divine.  The next day, I went back for more and tried the Chicken Enchilada Chili (made with red and green enchilada sauce) and the Turkey Bacon Avocado grilled panini (with muenster cheese and honey mustard).  For dessert, I sampled the Mixed Berry Creme Brule.  Day 2 was also awesome.  In addition to everything I already listed, I sampled other soups, sandwiches and salads that all tasted equally as delicious.  For example, the Wild Mushroom Bisque is next on my list to eat, since the sample I had left my mouth watering.  The Lobster Bisque, Shrimp & Sausage Gumbo, and Thai Lobster Curry also tasted superb.  As for sandwiches, I'd like to try the BBQ Pulled Pork next....or the Turkey Spinach Artichoke grilled panini.....or the Ultimate Grilled Cheese.  So many choices!!  I also heard amazing comments on the Nuts About Berries salad, the BBQ Chicken salad, and the Pina Colada Chicken salad.  Basically, this is now my new favorite lunch place, and I can't wait to try everything they have to offer!  You should definitely check it out!!

I would like to start by saying the star rating I am giving to Lesley's Creative Cakes is based solely on the customer service experience I had with her over a several month timeframe while planning my wedding.  The cake tasted great, however I would NOT recommend her to brides in the future - you already have enough stress as it is, find a baker who will help in instead of add to the stress.  My husband and I got married at the Windmill Winery in Florence, AZ last April.  It's been awhile, and I've debated whether to write this review at all, as the rest of our wedding was absolutely amazing and the Windmill Winery is spectacular to their customers.  However I would have appreciated this feedback prior to making my decision a year ago.    When we locked in the Winery, part of the package (including food, music, etc.) was the cake.  Lesley's Creative Cakes was their sole vendor for this space, so there were no other options that weren't considered an 'upgrade'.  My husband and I had been to two open houses offered at the Windmill Winery, in which a few of the cake flavors available had been there to sample, and I liked the flavor, so I was fine with it.  When it came time to discuss the cake with Lesley, however, we hit a snag.  I reached out a few months before the wedding date, asking if we could meet for a tasting.  She informed me that they didn't offer tastings at her site, and that I would need to visit an open house at the Winery to try her cakes (along with the masses of other people taking bites of whatever sheet cakes Lesley had decided to bring that day).  We emailed back and forth, and I politely expressed that I had been to several open houses at this point, and that the Winery was much further away from my house (I live in Scottsdale) than her bakery, could she make an exception.  The answer was no, and I was told that if we told her what flavors we wanted to try, she would make them and bring them to the next open house.  Frustrated, but accepting that this is what we would need to do, my fiancé and I made the hour and a half trek to the Winery a third time, for the sole purpose of doing a cake tasting.  When we arrived and made it through the line at the cake table, we were informed (quite briskly) that we would only be allowed to sample two flavors, since so many people had come to the open house that had not RSVP'd, and they would need to reserve what they brought so it would last.  Surprised, I asked to speak to Lesley, as she was expecting us - turns out, the brisk lady who turned us down was Lesley.  I let her know I was the one who had been emailing her regarding the cake tasting, thinking she would say "oh, no problem" and accommodate us since we had specifically requested more than 4 cake flavors to taste.  Nope.  No sympathy, no customer service, just a "sorry, we don't have enough".    At this point, I was fed up, and spoke with our wedding coordinator at the Winery to see if there were other options.  She in turn spoke to her manager, who apparently had a conversation with Lesley regarding the situation.  The Winery offered us the option to use another bakery if we thought we couldn't make this work.  I let her know that I was still ok to use her (a mistake, in hindsight), I just wanted to be able to taste the cakes and have a consultation.  I reached out to Lesley one more time, and this time she said she could accommodate us at her bakery, so my fiancé and I went to Gilbert shortly after for our consultation.  She seemed nicer this time around, and definitely seemed knowledgeable about cakes - and the ones we tasted were great.  She also showed us pictures of previous cakes, and they all looked fantastic.  We discussed color (my color theme was a pale mint and pale peach color, with gold and coral accents) - and after showing her tons of pinterest pics of cakes I loved, we agreed on a cake with tiers in pale peach, pale mint, and small golden pearls as accents.  I was also getting coral roses from our florist that would be placed on the cake BY Lesley at the time of delivery at the Winery the day of the wedding.  With the details ironed out,  I left our meeting feeling much better.  Flash forward to our wedding day.  The cake was delivered to the Winery, but Lesley bailed immediately instead of staying to place the flowers on the cake, so my cousin had to decorate it.  AND if that weren't enough, my 'pale' peach and mint cake looked like something radioactive.  Bright Orangey and Limey tiers that would have glowed in the dark.  My husband and I laugh about it at this point, because it was so ridiculous, and really not a big deal in the GRAND scheme of things.  But brides beware - I am not even a cake person (my husband is), but if you dream of having the most perfect cake on your wedding day, go here with caution.

I've been twice now, and had sub-par experiences both times.  I'm a HUGE fan of Brat Haus, and was super excited about Taco Haus's grand opening.  We went with a group of friends on opening night for Taco Tuesday.  We arrived in time for happy hour, but when we asked the server what happy hour specials they offered, he wasn't sure.  He double checked, no problem, and we ordered our drinks.  At 6:00, when Taco Tuesday officially started, we asked what the TT specials were.  Again - no clue.  I looked it up on FB and let him know what I found.  We later saw that there was a stack of TT menus at the hostess stand, but they were not shared with us.  Again, not a super big deal.  I ordered the guacamole to start, which was ok but a little bland (needed more salt or something).  The salsa (both green and brown) were amazing.  For dinner, I ordered the scallop ceviche.  I've had ceviche before, and did not remember it being so raw.  Possibly my fault, if that's how it typically comes, and I just didn't know that.  But the scallops were mushy and not at all appetizing, so I took about a bite and left the rest.  Mind you, I'm a sushi fan, so raw in general is not a problem for me, but the raw scallops were probably a bad choice.  I tasted a friend's empanada, and it was quite tasty.  Overall, I left wanting to give it a second chance, knowing it was opening night and they were still probably just working out some kinks.  The second time, I went for brunch.  I ordered a bloody mary, which was AMAZING.  Honestly, one of the best I've had.  My fiancé ordered a margarita.  Before he could specify WHICH margarita (there are several on the menu), the waitress had already hurried off .  No ask on salt or no salt, either.  She ended up bringing him the house margarita - which was not great.  My fiancé ordered the breakfast burrito, and seemed pretty happy with it.  I ordered the Cubano sandwich, and was less than impressed.  The ham looked like a slice you would get at the deli counter, not the pork i was imagining for a cuban sandwich. The mustard was little overpowering, and was just your standard yellow mustard.  I feel like I probably could have duplicated that at home.  And the sandwich had no side, which I was kind of hoping for.  We let our server know we were done....and waited.  After about 20+ minutes of trying to track her down and having her race past us (mind you, it was NOT that busy).  she finally came back to our table - and asked if we were done.  We said again that we were, and waited for the bill.  I forgot to mention that we had ordered the guacamole again as a starter.  Same fairly bland taste, but we asked for some salt and that helped.  Then found a hair in my salsa, so the rest sat unfinished.  When the check finally came, I noticed that the waitress had charged me for the guacamole - and also separately for the chips.  I did not pay close attention to my bill the first visit to see if that is common, but I found it weird.  If guacamole is listed as an appetizer, not a side, why WOULDNT it come with chips?  What else would I eat it with?  At this point, we were ready to go, so I let it be.  Both of these visits were in the first week of opening, and so I am hopeful that they will work out the kinks quickly.  I'll give it one more shot, simply because I love it's sister, Brat Haus, so much, and I hope they succeed.
