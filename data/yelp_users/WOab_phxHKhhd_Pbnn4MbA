I've been coming here ever since I was little and wouldn't go anywhere else to get my nails done! I love the familiar faces of the staff and they always do an amazing job! I live in Tempe now but drive the distance just to get my eyebrows done by Cookie!

I came here for the 2nd time last night and once again everything was above and beyond by the amazing sushi chef. Sat at the sushi bar and was given a sample of the black rice that is supposedly a lot healthier and boy did it taste like the white rice but maybe even better! Probably one of my favorite spots for sushi because you can truly taste the love and effort put into each dish! 5 stars*****

This place usually isn't one of my go to sandwich spots, but I was craving one of their smoothies so I decided I would give it another try since their food isn't too bad either.   I came in around 2:30 after my shift at work and decided to get the turkey artichoke sandwich that I've had before that I enjoyed very much. I ordered it with no mayo, onions or the pickle on the side due to my strong dislike for them.   I waited patiently while they made my sandwich and while I was in no rush I sipped on the delicious pink pi√±a colada smoothie on this hot summer day. I noticed some other customers that were in my view walked up behind the counter because the guy apparently wanted more tea and there weren't any filled up by the beverage station. The guy who might have been a manager (since he was wearing a headset) seemed very annoyed that they did that. I agree it was rude to walk back there without asking, but what does he expect when the teas for the customers weren't filled at the beverage station? The man responded to him just saying it'll take 15 minutes to make more. No apologies were given to the man in need of some more tea.   The girl who originally took my order brought me my sandwich and I politely thanked her and got up and checked my sandwich just due to past experiences to make sure everything looked right before I left the place. Unfortunately, the pickle was still in there so I immediately threw it in the nearest trash can and also checked my sandwich to make sure the pesto butter was on there because they've left it off multiple times before.   I went to the front and asked the cashier just to confirm that it does come with pesto and she didn't seem too sure so she asked the same man who was wearing the headset and he stated that it's a pesto butter and I said that I was aware because I've gotten it before and it didn't look like it was on there. Instead of just apologizing and giving me an extra side and letting me on my way the man asked the baker or the girl who was making the sandwiches in the back if she put it on there and she yelled back in an angry tone "YES!" And the guy looked back at me and said, " She said she put it on there." I just looked at both of them very confused because I was so surprised of how they handled this.   Just to be clear, I was not upset until I received the worst customer service I could've possibly gotten. I wasn't expecting anything, but just an extra side of the pesto butter, but they just made me feel like I was a burden to them even though no one was in line behind me so I wasn't preventing them from helping someone else.   I work in the food industry and they clearly could've known that since I was wearing my work uniform, and I deal with people's requests all day long, and since this was something so minor and how they dealt with this it made me never want to come here again. This isn't the first time the employees have showed poor customer service, but this is definitely the worst by far.   One star for the smoothie, but I'd rather take my business elsewhere next time for better customer service.
