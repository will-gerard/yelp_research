I am confused why so often I will go into a Bank Of America and there are a dozen or so customers waiting, while there is only one teller and two or three bank employees seated at their desk or just standing.  Today I wanted to get something notarized, got tired of waiting and ended up going to a UPS store.

I am a small business owner and often need to have keys made, door locks fixed, locks changed etc.   Often, the need arises when you least expect it.  Don has always been able to handle our requests in a timely manner.  He always has a great story to tell also!

I have been a Bank of America customer for 14 years.  The last 10 years I have been a loyal customer of this branch.  I have gotten to know the employees on a first name basis and had felt very satisfied with the service.  The last few months at this branch have been a disaster! The drive thru will be closed although the posted sign says open.  The line in the branch are routinely 8 deep in customers and the wait is at least 15 min. What persuaded me to write this review is last week I went into the branch to make a deposit.  The manager informed me there would be a 25 minute wait.  I communicated that the service at the branch had deteriorated.  He said the service was still good but that the wait was just longer.  HELLO!  He suggested I make the deposit at the ATM. He said the bank is in transitioning into more on-line banking.  I left and drove a couple of miles to Stapley and Main branch.  Was in and out in 5 min.  Not going back to Main and Mcdonald.

Max takes care of my boys every time.  Finally someone that cuts their hair the way they like. This time they asked me to take them.. In the past it was like pulling teeth.

If you want to treat you taste buds to something deliciously different than the normal Az cuisine, this is the place.  Republic has a great locally owned vibe and the food is fresh and delicious.  So far I have not ventured past the El Capitan and Chicken.  This evening I tried the Fig, cheese and caramel.  Soo good.  The empanadas are just the perfect size that you can dip them into the tasty green sauce and treat the buds to a pop rock like experience of flavors.  Went well with their double IPA.

Great place to take kids for after school treat.  Mom and Pop atmosphere,  very clean, nice people.  My six year old says, This place is much better than Dunking Donuts!" Donuts are fresh.  They also have sandwiches. We have yet to try them.
