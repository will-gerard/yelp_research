I am in love with this yoga studio. I just starting Bikram yoga a week ago (usually do Anusara yoga). I was really hesitant to try Bikram, but my doctor kept suggesting it. It is a wonderful workout and meditation. The first two classes took a little getting used to with the heat, but by the third and forth it felt much more natural.  The instructors and staff here are wonderful. They are always open to any questions you have after class and even talked to me about what types of hydration are good (I suggest coconut water in addition to regular water). The studio is really calming. In the room where you come in before class there are comfortable places to sit with lots of books on meditation. It is a wonderful environment. They also do a $20 two week intro with unlimited classes you you can see if Bikram is right for you. I suggest it to anyone who has been considering giving Bikram a try.

I first started going to Desert Song about a year and a half ago with the intro class, and I am hooked! Mary Beth is amazing and makes you feel like she has built a workout around you. The classes are always something different, so you get a good workout every week.   The into class is great for anyone just getting started or who needs a refresher. Also when you do the intro you get a discount on the first class set you buy and can drop into any classes in addition to the intro classes for only $10 the whole month you are in intro.  Stephanie is my favorite instructor because she works you very hard, but her classes have a great energy. I am really starting to notice an improvement in my balance and strength (I no longer feel like I am going to do a face plant when I go into cobra). Whether you are a beginner or advanced you should check it out.

You have to try the velvet!!! Lux is so to die for, we actually had a meeting at my office that it is ok to go during work hours without counting it as a break as long as you bring some back for everyone. (no joke)

I went to Breadfruit a few months ago and waited until now to post it, to keep myself from saying anything too mean. I went with my boyfriend and had the worst service.  The server kept just wandering back and forth between the kitchen and dining room without doing anything. We had to try several times every time we wanted to get his attention. Also a note on the menu. -  I am extremely pick (I know this so I try to keep it in perspective). I have been a vegetarian since I was 10 and do not like meat at all. I ordered the tofu, but when it came out it looked more like chicken, and the texture was like chicken. I asked my boyfriend to try a piece and he thought it was chicken as well. After several attempts we got the server's attention and asked him if he was sure they made tofu and not chicken by mistake. This is where our serves becomes unbelievable. The guy actually yells at me that "it is not chicken, it is tempeh not chicken!" (tempeh is a soy product, but is not tofu. It should not be listed as tofu on the menu) If it had been listed correctly on the menu I would not have ordered it because I already know I do not like it. I did not know how to react. I ended up just eating the rice, and the server ignored us the rest of the meal. He came back to pick up the plates noticing I did not eat it and didn't say a word or offer to take it off the bill. It then took us another 10 minutes at least to get him to pick up the bill. I will never go back here!

Sens is wonderful. I went on a Friday night, Carlo waited on my friend and I. He was extremely helpful and made lots of good suggestions. He also kept bringing us really good infused sake to try. The Hong Kong Flat Rice was amazing. I will definitely make this a frequent stop.

This place has the best horchata!!!!! You have to try it, but it only comes in one very large size so it is best to share. They also have a great salsa bar and good vegitarian tacos.
