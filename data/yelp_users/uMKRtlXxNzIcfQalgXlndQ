Recently placed an order for delivery, upon my dinner being delivered by Jesus who was very pleasant I might add, I realized that my order was completely messed up. Missing sides that I had ordered but was charged for. To Jesus and he called the store, the girl on the phone told me it would be about 30-45minutes before the driver could bring it back out. I said never mind just take it off my order, she then hung up the phone on me. Definitely lost my business.   Food may have changed but the customer service is a joke.

This place is a joke. I don't normally order from them since every time I do there is issue most of the time. Well yet again I place an order online, and I order extra dipping sauces and get charged for them rightfully so. But when they don't get delivered and then I get push back from the driver. I even show them my order showing what I ordered he then apologizes and says he will be back in 10 minutes with my sauces. 45 minutes later after everyone has eaten and the food is gone I get a knock on the door and it's the driver with the sauces I no have an use for. This place is a joke! If you are in the area go to Barros on 24th St and Baseline, save yourself the headache.

Hands down one of the best Texas Roadhouse locations I've ever been too. The place is always clean and everyone is very pleasant. Only had a minor issue once and the manger (Janelle I think was her name) was very accommodating and pleasant. Always a great place to come and visit.  Highly recommended!!

Waited 15 minutes to be seated and as we were walked to out seats we passed 9 tables that were open that we could have been sat in.

Never heard of this place until today, it was suggested by a friend and boy was I pleased. It was so good! I had the avadavo which was really good and I'm not a huge pork fan. I also tried the green chili Mac and that was bomb.com this place is a must. Very dark and secluded make a great date nite place.

Well I am somewhat of a regular here but after tonight they may have lost me as a customer all together. I've never had such horrible service in my life than I did this evening, "Danni" was absolutely horrid.   Not only did I have to chase her down to place my order after 30 minutes, then she took it upon herself to change my order because she "assumed" I would want it this way. After waiting an additional 20 minutes to flag her down to get my bill she proceeded to serve another table, and sit down at one table to get their order. This was ridiculous!   #endrant

First time ever coming here even though I live less than a mile away. I have to admit it was fantastic! I ordered the Surf & Turf taco plate. Both of the tacos were full of flavor and tasted very fresh.  I got the Spanish rice instead of beans and it was delicious, not dry and over cooked like most places.  The young man at the register "Chris" was very helpful with ordering and extremely pleasant. I will definitely be coming back to check out the $1.50 tacos on Tuesday.

This a great car wash! Very clean, gives you a great wash, love that it accepts plastic, nicely lit up. Nothing but great things to say about it. Just wish there was one closer to my home.

Where do I start? So tonight is my birthday and me and some friends went to Kobe for a fun filled dinner before we began our night, well that was ruined with this experience.  The dinner started off by not getting a chef to our table for over 45 minutes! I felt my night was already ruined, but chef Taylor was a blast and made it quite enjoyable. The food was delicious and prepared exactly how I wanted it. So we then ate our food and asked our server Ana for our bill.   Here is where all hell broke loose, in the course of 30 minutes and 5 different attempts to bring us the prober bills I finally had to request a manager. A young lady came out and labeled herself as a "half server" whatever that is. Asked what was the matter. I then explained and she stated she would take care of it. Her taking care of it was a 10% discount. I felt so insulted, not only did I have to cancel my birthday plans but they felt my time and frustration was only worth 10%.   Thanks Kobe for ruining my birthday plans.

This is the worst Applebees I've ever set foot in. So ghetto that they have a police officer that just hangs out in the restaurant, definitely something I don't want my children seeing.  The staff is rude and disrespectful. Never will I set foot in here again.  I can't believe corporate hasn't shut this place down yet.

So I come to this location often, maybe twice a week. But as of late something has seriously changed in the management. The serving sizes have became so small it's quite sad to say the least.  They still have a great quality product and the staff is pleasant for the most part, but these portions are a joke. They seriously need to take a look at what's going and change it back to how it was.

Worst customer  service I have had in a long time. I go to this location often for lunch since I work around the corner, I came in today to grab a quick sub and it was def not quick. The young lady preparing my sandwich was on her cell phone the entire time using her Bluetooth. It cause her to not pay attention to any of the customers in the store and she had to ask multiple times what the customer had just said. What a joke! Why does this person even have a job if they can't take a job at subway serious.

I'd almost give them 5 stars other than the barber made me bleed with the straight razor haha. Nothing crazy, but they did a really good bald fade. I was worried since I just moved here from Michigan.

Besides the fact that it was extremely cold in the restaurant, upon being sat at our table by Alex the hostess I pointed out to her that there were several tables (6 to be exact) that had not been bussed or cleaned. Her response to me was its not my job so I'm not dealing with it. I found that to be very in professional.

I love this place! I stop in 4 days a week for breakfast. The place is always so clean and welcoming, everyone that works there is always so pleasant and happy. They get my drink out fast and never having an issue. Highly recommend the Acai Super Anti Oxidant

I wasn't impressed what so ever. Did a half assed wash, and a horrible dry. Things that I did like though were the free air freshener, and that tracks accommodated lowered vehicles. But other than that, it's no more special than any other half assed car wash in the valley.   Not sure why it's so difficult to have a decent car wash out here. On to the next one I guess.

Love this place! The family is great and always welcoming. On pick up orders they usually give you a free bottle of water. The food is amazing, could be a little spicier but that's my opinion.  The lunch specials are fantastic!

This place is a joke. It is so hot inside it's ridiculous. I'm literally sweating at the table just waiting for my food. Very stuffy inside with little to no air flow, they only have 3 ceiling fans from the 80's cooling the place off, no AC what so ever.   I left before even ordering based on the fact it was so hot inside. Living in the desert you wanna get away from the heat when you go to dinner, not sweat at the dinner table. I will not be returning here ever again.

Could not believe the way I was treated at this location on the evening of 4/7/15. I stopped by the drive through at exactly 10:31pm which is 29 minutes before the drive through closes. I pulled up to the speaker and no one said anything after a few minutes I pulled ahead to the window.  I saw the employees cleaning up early and I flagged one down, he told me they were closed. I simply stated that there sign said they were open till 11:00pm which by now was still 15 minutes to go. He said oh well everything is shut off and sent me on my way.  I couldn't believe it!! Plus there were 4 other cars behind me in the drive through, I'm sure the owner would be glad to know his staff is just throwing money away.

Stay as far away as possible. This place is a joke. Worst customer service I've ever dealt with. No one seems to know what's going on. No one feels it's there job to take responsibility, they always wanna pass the blame to everyone else. Avoid them at all cost!!!!!!

Been here 3 times now. I love that it's so close to home and I don't have to venture into Tempe for a decent piece of pizza. Everything has always came out really good and when I order for pick up its ready when I get there no waiting or anything.
